The '''AeroVironment Global Observer''' is a concept for a high-altitude, long endurance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]], designed by [[AeroVironment]] (AV) to operate as a stratospheric [[geosynchronous]] satellite system with regional coverage.&lt;ref name="did"&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/aerovironments-global-observer-flying-high-again-03902/ Defense Industry Daily]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Global Observer aircraft, each flying for up to a week at an altitude of {{convert|55000|to|65000|ft|m}}, could alternate coverage over any area on the earth, providing a platform for communications relays, remote sensing, or long-term surveillance. In addition to flying above weather and above other conventional aircraft, operation at this altitude permits communications and sensor payloads on the aircraft to service an area on the surface of the earth up to {{convert|600|mi|km}} in diameter, equivalent to more than {{convert|280000|sqmi|km2}} of coverage. Global Observer may offer greater flexibility than a satellite and longer duration than conventional manned and unmanned aircraft.&lt;ref name="did"/&gt;

==Development==

===JCTD program===
The Global Observer Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program had the goal of helping solve the capability gap in persistent ISR and communications relay for the [[US military]] and homeland security.  The Global Observer JCTD demonstrated a new stratospheric, extreme endurance UAS that could be transitioned for post-JCTD development, extended user evaluation, and fielding.  The program was a joint effort with the [[U.S. Department of Defense]], [[Department of Homeland Security]], and AeroVironment that started in September 2007, to culminate in a Joint Operational Utility Assessment (JOUA) in 2011.

The program provided for the system development, production of two aircraft, development flight testing, and JOUA with ISR and communications relay payload.  The flight testing and JOUA was conducted at the Air Force Flight Test Center at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. The primary objectives of the Global Observer JCTD Program were:

*Develop enabling technologies for a liquid hydrogen powered Global Observer UAS.
*Design, build, and demonstrate the Global Observer UAS for a 5 - 7 day endurance for {{convert|55000|to|65000|ft|m}} altitude missions with 380-pound, 2.8&amp;nbsp;kW payload capacity. The system had to be capable of being transported by a C-130 aircraft.
*Integrate and assess military utility of modular Global Observer payloads to address user identified gaps in ISR and communications relay.
*Evaluate system life cycle costs.

===JCTD sponsors===
*U.S. Department of Defense
*United States Special Operations Command
*United States Strategic Command
*U.S. Department of Homeland Security
*U.S. Air Force
*U.S. Army
*U.S. Coast Guard
*U.S. Defense Threat Reductions Agency

===Flight test partners===
*Air Force Flight Test Center
*NASA Dryden Flight Research Center

===Mission possibilities===
High-altitude, long endurance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, such as Global Observer, may enable several capabilities that enable rapid and effective actions or [[countermeasure]]s:
* '''Communications relay.'''  Durable, satellite-like, affordable communications relay with substantial bandwidth capacity can interconnect and route data in real time, enabling teams and command centers separated by topographical barriers to communicate with each other.
* '''Disaster response.''' Hurricane, storm tracking and general weather monitoring may be useful in evacuation planning, relief operations and first response coordination. Global Observer provides communication alternatives in the event of cell tower, microwave relay and satellite downlink failure.
* '''Maritime surveillance.''' Coastlines plagued by transport of illegal goods can be subject to long-term surveillance. Analysts can observe suspicious activity, determine patterns of behavior and identify threats.

==History==

A Global Observer prototype, called "Odyssey," flew in May 2005.  It had a {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}}, one-third the size of the planned full-sized version, and ran solely on hydrogen fuel-cells powering electric motors that drove eight propellers, flying the aircraft for several hours.  The JCTD started in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2005-11/aerovironment-global-observer AEROVIRONMENT GLOBAL OBERSVER] - Popsci.com, 8 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag10aug10"&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/aerovironment-global-observer-long-endurance-uav-wing-load-tests/16022/ AeroVironment Global Observer long endurance UAS completes wing load tests] - Gizmag.com, 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, Aerovironment announced that the full-sized Global Observer wing had passed wing load testing.  The 53&amp;nbsp;m (175&amp;nbsp;ft) all-composite wing, which comes in five sections and is designed to maximize wing strength while minimizing weight, had loads applied to it that approximated the maximum loads it is designed to withstand during normal flight, turbulence and maneuvers.  In its third year of testing, the demonstrator had also undergone ground and taxi tests as well as taken a "short hop" lifting off the ground briefly during taxiing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/global-observer-clears-wing-load-testing-346040/ Global Observer clears wing load testing] - Flightglobal.com, 11 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag10aug10"/&gt;

The Global Observer performed its first flight on 5 August 2010, taking off from Edwards AFB and reaching an altitude of {{convert|4,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for one hour.  The flight was performed using battery power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-first-flight/16049/ Global Observer successfully completes first flight] - Gizmag.com, 16 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;The aircraft completed initial flight testing, consisting of multiple low-altitude flights, at Edwards AFB in August and September 2010.  This phase used batteries to power the hybrid-electric aircraft and approximate full aircraft weight and center of gravity for flight control, performance, and responsiveness evaluation.  Following this, the program team installed and ground tested the aircraft's hydrogen-fueled generator and liquid hydrogen fuel tanks which will power it for up to a week in the [[stratosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/AeroVironment_Global_Observer_Stratospheric_Unmanned_Aircraft_System_Completes_Initial_Flight_Testing_999.html AeroVironment Global Observer Stratospheric UAV Completes Initial Testing] - Spacedaily.com, 26 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The first flight of the Global Observer using hydrogen fuel occurred on 11 January 2011, reaching an altitude of {{convert|5,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for four hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-uav-first-hydrogen-powered-flight/17602/ Global Observer unmanned aircraft makes first hydrogen-powered flight] - Gizmag.com, 16 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2011, Global Observer-1 (GO-1), the first aircraft to be completed, crashed 18 hours into its 9th test flight.  AeroVironment said it was undergoing flight test envelope expansion and had been operating for nearly twice the endurance and at a higher altitude than previous flights when the crash occurred.  At the time, the second aircraft developed as part of the JCTD program was nearing completion at a company facility; the $140 million program was originally scheduled for completion in late 2011, but the crash delayed this by a year.  AeroVironment was looking for sources of incremental funding to provide a bridge between the demonstration and a future procurement program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-crash/18321/ Global Observer UAS crashes during flight-testing] - Gizmag.com, 4 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/awin/aerovironment-global-observer-crash-rattles-observers-0 AeroVironment Global Observer Crash Rattles Observers] - Aviationweek.com, 1 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Observer crashes during test flight |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/04/04/Global-Observer-crashes-during-test-flight/UPI-41741301921265/ |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |agency=United Press International|date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the Pentagon closed the development contract for the Global Observer, the reason being the crash in April 2011.  The Global Observer was used as a technology demonstration, not a program for a functioning aircraft.  In April 2013, the Pentagon stated that no service or defense agency had advocated for it to be a program.  AeroVironment is currently in possession of the second prototype Global Observer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/04/pentagon-global-observer/ No One Wants the Pentagon’s Gigantic Hydrogen-Powered Drone] Wired.com, April 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 February 2014, AeroVironment announced that it had teamed with [[Lockheed Martin]] to sell the Global Observer to international customers.  The partnership is focused around building "atmospheric satellite systems" around the UAV.  The Global Observer may compete for orders with the [[Boeing]] [[Phantom Eye]] liquid hydrogen-powered long endurance UAV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/aerovironment-teams-with-lockheed-martin-on-global-observer-395675/ AeroVironment teams with Lockheed Martin on Global Observer] - Flightglobal.com, 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/2014-02-09/aerovironment-lockheed-martin-advance-global-observer-uas AeroVironment, Lockheed Martin Advance Global Observer UAS] - Ainonline.com, 9 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3248">[[File:Arched hill symbol.jpg|thumb|Arched-hill symbol (here a three arched-hill symbol with crescent).]]
The '''Arched-hill symbol''' is a fairly current symbol on ancient [[Coinage of India]]. There some variations at to the number of the hills depicted, or the symbol surmounting the hill, such as a [[crescent]] or a star.

It is thought that the three-arched hill symbol was initiated during the [[Maurya Empire]] (3rd–2nd century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;"The crescented three- arched hill symbol, seems to have originally been adopted by Chandragupta Maurya." Malwa Through the Ages, from the Earliest Times to 1305 A.D, Kailash Chand Jain Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1972 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_3O7q7cU7k0C&amp;pg=PA145]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in coins from [[Taxila]] dated from 220 BCE, the three-arched symbol appears regularly, and from 185 BCE is regularly associated with the animal figures of the elephant and the lion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cngcoins.com/Coin.aspx?CoinID=150982 CNG Coins]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Nandipada]] is generally associated with the [[zebu]] bull.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cngcoins.com/Coin.aspx?CoinID=127009 CNG Coins]&lt;/ref&gt; On coins of the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga period]], the three-arched hill can appear among a multitude of other symbols, such as the [[Nandipada]], the tree-in-railing, the elephant, or the empty cross.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The symbol is generally considered a representation of a [[Buddhist]] [[Chaitya]] or a [[Mount Meru|Meru]].&lt;ref&gt;"symbols generally called as three- or six- or multiple-arched hill or chaitya" Tribal Coins of Ancient India - Devendra Handa - 2007 Page 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Let us examine the symbol of Hillocks. The three arched hill symbols called variously as Meru, Chaitya etc. with its several variations, for example with five arches," six arches, » three arches of which one is placed above the two..." Seminar Papers on the Local Coins of Northern India, Awadh K Narain - 1968, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that it was the imperial symbol of the Mauryas.&lt;ref&gt;Coin Splendour: A Journey Into the Past, Prasanna Rao Bandela, Abhinav Publications, 2003, p.28 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_mUg2BBJr7kC&amp;pg=PA28]&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol however, appears in many post-Mauryan contexts as seen with the coins of Taxila and the Shungas.

The '''2009 [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] protests''' were a series of protests which occurred on 27 December 2009 in [[Iran]] against the outcome of the June [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 Iranian presidential election]], which demonstrators claim was [[electoral fraud|rigged]]. The demonstrations were part of the [[2009 Iranian election protests]] and were the largest since June. In December 2009, the protests saw an escalation in violence.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,669317,00.html | author=Ulrike Putz| title= Violence in Tehran; Iranian Demonstrators Put Regime on the Defensive |publisher=Spiegel International |date=29 December 2009|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/december-18-marked-the-beginning.html |title=Ashura 101 – Tehran Bureau &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/ashura-videos.html |title=Ashura videos [Graphic&amp;#93; – Tehran Bureau &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this protest, [[December 30, 2009 pro-government rally in Iran|pro-government protesters hold a rally]] in a "show of force" three days later on December 30 (9 [[Dey (month)|Dey]]) to condemn Green Movement protester.&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karami|first1=Arash|title=Iran marks anniversary of anti-Green Movement protests|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/12/iran-anti-green-movement-protest-anniversary.html|accessdate=January 12, 2017|agency=Al-Monitor|date=December 30, 2014|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Irregularities during the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 Iranian presidential election]] caused resentment among many Iranians. While post-election protests were mostly peaceful, some violence erupted, leading to clashes between security forces and protesters, while some outspoken political dissenters were detained.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, Opposition leaders detained in Iran, 19 June 2009 [https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/opposition-leaders-detained-in-iran-20090619]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, dissenters continued to speak out against the Government, leading to further protests in December 2009. On 19 December 2009, the Grand Ayatollah [[Hossein Ali Montazeri]], who had become a "spiritual leader" of the opposition, died. Montazeri's funeral, held on 21 December in the city of [[Qom]], was attended by a large gathering of people&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; and clashes ensued between security forces and mourners,&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; leading on to further demonstrations in Qom and [[Isfahan]].&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; On 26 December, a paramilitary [[Basij]] force subordinate to the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] stormed a mosque in [[Tehran]] where scholar and former [[President of Iran|President]] [[Mohammad Khatami]] was speaking.&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; This was followed by continued clashes in Tehran in which ''Jaras'', a news media of the critics, estimated eight to ten people had died.&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt;

Prior to [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], Mohsen Kadivar said he could not "rule out the possibility" of state intervention in the planned protests.&lt;ref name=spiegel-2/&gt;

===Protests===

On 27 December, demonstrations in several cities continued into the holy day of [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] the climax of [[Muharram]], the month of mourning. Protesters in Tehran gathered "From Imam Hussain Square to Freedom Square", "from east to west along Revolution Street", and it was on this day that "the political and religious symbology of Iran's Islamic regime was turned on its head".&lt;ref name=time.com/&gt;  The protesters made another symbolic move- a "symbolic journey from a square named after its most revered hero toward a monument dedicated to freedom, along a street called Revolution."&lt;ref name=time.com/&gt;

[[Death of Seyed Ali Mousavi|Seyed Ali Mousavi]], the 35-year-old nephew of [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]], was among those killed in the violence.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=time.com/&gt; Later, it was reported that his body had disappeared, precluding the possibility of a quick burial, while state sources indicated that an autopsy was being performed.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8432297.stm | author=BBC| title=Iran opposition figures arrested after protests|publisher=BBC| date=28 December 2009|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mousavi was buried on 30 December.&lt;ref name=aad/&gt;

==Analysis==
{{POV-section|date=June 2017}}
According to Ibrahim Moussawi, associate professor of [[Lebanese University]] and head of [[Hizbullah]]'s media relations, the incident damaged "public relations" of the Green Movement with Iranian citizenry more than all events as the acts of the protesters on that day including "applauding, whistling, and engaging in other cheerful displays," was "widely" seen as violation of a "red line" and targeting [[Husayn ibn Ali]] and [[Day of Ashura|Ashura commemoration]] itself.&lt;ref name="Ibrahim"/&gt; Various society groups including "[[Marja'|marej-'e taqlid]], the society of Iranian doctors, university student groups, the Iranian Parliament, Oil Industry Workers, the Iranian Women's Culture and Education Society, the Society of Iranian Teachers, the Iranian Professors Society, provincial governors and municipalities and [[bazaar]]s" expressed their condemnation and many of them publicly asked for the "prosecution of the opposition leaders".&lt;ref name="Ibrahim"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moussawi|first1=Ibrahim|title=Shi&amp;‘ism and the Democratisation Process in Iran: With a focus on Wilayat al-Faqih|publisher=Saqi|isbn=9780863568312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kAhBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT157&amp;lpg=PT157&amp;dq=Desecration+of+Ashura+2009+protest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n50eaC439t&amp;sig=Ohsem0SVCFkGQXFkH_x5B7ACrfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG2KHG0r3RAhWGYJoKHVrxDCEQ6AEIPDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Desecration%20of%20Ashura%202009%20protest&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
Many people are set to stand trial for taking part in the protests. At least one person arrested in connection with the protest, a university lecturer [[Abdolreza Ghanbari]] living in [[Pakdasht]], has been accused of "[[moharebeh]]," (an Islamic term meaning "warring against God") and sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.labourstart.org/cgi-bin/solidarityforever/show_campaign.cgi?c=1299 |title=Iran: Stop the execution of Abdolreza Ghanbari |publisher=labourstart.org |year=2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011500705.html|title=Iran to try 16 people soon over December unrest: report|work=Washington Post|accessdate=16 January 2010}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
The governments of Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States are among those who have condemned the violence.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; [[POTUS|US President]] [[Barack Obama]] openly criticized the Iranian government's violent crackdown on the protests in a speech and declared "The decision of Iran's leaders to govern through fear and tyranny will not continue."&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;  Russia's Foreign Ministry expressed concern at the violence. It encouraged "a compromise on the basis of the law, and also to take political efforts to prevent a further escalation of the confrontation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091228/157405302.html |title=Russia voices concern over Tehran unrest &amp;#124; Russia &amp;#124; RIA Novosti |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=28 December 2009 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuela condemned what it called Western governments' interference in Iran's internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-12/31/content_12732931.htm |title=Venezuela blames U.S. for destabilizing Iran_English_Xinhua |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=31 December 2009 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slogans==
Since the protest coincided with [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], the commemoration observed by Shi'as for the death of [[Imam Hussein]], the third Imam of Shia's who were killed by the order of [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] [[Yazid I]], protesters deliberately blended their political message with the Ashura's religious one in this protest. They alternated anti-government slogans with ancient cries of mourning for [[Imam Hussein]].&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;

*"This is a month of blood. The dictator will fall"&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Protesters equated [[Ayatollah Khamenei]] with [[Yazid I]], the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] who ordered Imam Hussein's killing.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;
*"Death to the dictator"&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

'''Asian psychology''' is a branch of [[cultural psychology]] that studies psychological concepts as they relate to [[Culture of Asia|Asian culture]]. Psychologists studying these issue are often aligned with [[cross-cultural psychology]].

==Asian behavior==
As pointed out by Shinobu Kitayama, professor of psychology and Director of the Culture &amp; Cognition Program at the [[University of Michigan]], culture can have a profound impact on the way people think about and perceive the world around them. East Asians may think differently from Westerners (See also, [[Self-concept#Cultural differences|Cultural differences in self-concept]] and [[Construals#Construal_and_.22the_self.22|Self-construal]].) Kitayama proposed that unlike the traditional American point-of-view which accentuates the importance of one's self and makes oneself independent, an Asian will instead feel more interdependent.&lt;ref name="Asian Behavior"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2267|title=Asian Psychology Coming of Age|last=Kitayama|first=Shinobu|publisher=American Association for Psychology Science|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement==
Asian psychologists wanted to have an expanding role in the science of psychology, but felt limited due to the heavy western influence. Predominant figures in Asian psychology are Quicheng Jing in China, Hiroshi Azuma in Japan, Ku-Shu Yang in Taiwan, and Durganand Sinha in India.

==''Asian American Journal of Psychology''==
The ''[[Asian American Journal of Psychology]]''® is the official publication of the Asian American Psychological Association and is dedicated to research, practice, advocacy, education, and policy within Asian American psychology. The Journal publishes empirical, theoretical, methodological, and practice oriented articles and book reviews covering topics relevant to Asian American individuals and communities, including prevention, intervention, training, and social justice. Particular consideration is given to empirical articles using quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methodology.

==''Asian Journal of Social Psychology''==
The ''Asian Journal of Social Psychology'' stimulates research and encourages academic exchanges for the advancement of social psychology in Asia. It publishes theoretical and empirical papers by Asian scholars and those interested in Asian cultures and societies.
 
The ''Asian Journal of Social Psychology'' is partly funded by a Grant-in-Aid for Publication of Scientific Research Results from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

==AAPA Online==
AAPA was founded in 1972 and is the largest organization of faculty, students, researchers, and practitioners interested in Asian American psychology. Our members and initiatives have positively impacted psychological treatment, education, training, research, policy and social justice advocacy, through research dissemination, organizational policy statements and collaboration with other psychological organizations for publications, training initiatives, and disseminating resources for serving Asian American communities.

==Contributions==
Over the years, the contribution to the study of psychology was done mostly by US European psychologists, however, in recent years this has been changing. More Asian countries than ever before are contributing to psychology at an ever increasing rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.iaccp.org/xian/PDFs/2_1Adair.pdf |title=Beyond Indigenization: Asian Psychology’s Contribution to the World of Psychology |last=Adair |first=John |publisher=International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology |accessdate=1 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324120411/http://ebooks.iaccp.org/xian/PDFs/2_1Adair.pdf |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[set theory]], '''Cantor's diagonal argument''', also called the '''diagonalisation argument''', the '''diagonal slash argument''' or the '''diagonal method''', was published in 1891 by [[Georg Cantor]] as a [[mathematical proof]] that there are [[infinite set]]s which cannot be put into [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] with the infinite set of [[natural number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Georg Cantor |title=Ueber eine elementare Frage der Mannigfaltigkeitslehre |journal=[[Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung]] 1890–1891 |volume=1 |pages=75–78 |year=1891|url=https://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=GDZPPN002113910&amp;physid=phys84#navi}} English translation: {{cite book |last=Ewald |first=William B.

Such sets are now known as [[uncountable set]]s, and the size of infinite sets is now treated by the theory of [[cardinal number]]s which Cantor began.

The diagonal argument was not Cantor's [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|first proof]] of the uncountability of the [[real number]]s, which appeared in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |surname=Gray|given=Robert|year=1994 |url=http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/Gray819-832.pdf |title=Georg Cantor and Transcendental Numbers|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=101|issue=9|pages=819–832 |doi=10.2307/2975129|jstor=2975129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloch2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloch|first1=Ethan D.|title=The Real Numbers and Real Analysis|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-72176-7|page=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uncountable set ==
In his 1891 article, Cantor considered the set ''T'' of all infinite [[sequences]] of [[binary digits]] (i.e. each digit is zero or one).
He begins with a [[constructive proof]] of the following theorem:
:If ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, … is any enumeration of elements from ''T'', then there is always an element ''s'' of ''T'' which corresponds to no ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in the enumeration.
The proof starts with an enumeration of elements from ''T'', for example:
:{|
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = || (0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = || (1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = || (0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = || (1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = || (1, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = || (0, || 0, || 1, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = || (1, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ...
|}
Next, a sequence ''s'' is constructed by choosing the 1st digit as [[Ones' complement|complementary]] to the 1st digit of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; (swapping '''0'''s for '''1'''s and vice versa), the 2nd digit as complementary to the 2nd digit of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, the 3rd digit as complementary to the 3rd digit of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;, and generally for every ''n'', the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; digit as complementary to the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; digit of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. For the example above, this yields:
:{|
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (&lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (1, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (0, || 1, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (1, || 0, || 1, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || 0, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (1, || 1, || 0, || 1, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (0, || 0, || 1, || 1, || 0, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (1, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 1, || 0, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || ...)
|-
| ...
|-
|
|-
| ''s'' || = || (&lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || ...)
|}
By construction, ''s'' differs from each ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, since their ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; digits differ (highlighted in the example).
Hence, ''s'' cannot occur in the enumeration.

Based on this theorem, Cantor then uses a [[proof by contradiction]] to show that:
:The set ''T'' is uncountable.
The proof starts by assuming that ''T'' is [[countable set#Definition|countable]].
Then all its elements can be written as an enumeration ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, … .
Applying the previous theorem to this enumeration produces a sequence ''s'' not belonging to the enumeration. However, this contradicts ''s'' being an element of ''T'' and therefore belonging to the enumeration. This contradiction implies that the original assumption is false. Therefore, ''T'' is uncountable.

=== Interpretation ===
The interpretation of Cantor's result will depend upon one's view of mathematics. To [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivists]], the argument shows no more than that there is no [[bijection]] between the natural numbers and ''T''. It does not rule out the possibility that the latter are [[subcountable]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the context of [[classical mathematics]], this is impossible, and the diagonal argument establishes that, although both sets are infinite, there are actually ''more'' infinite sequences of ones and zeros than there are natural numbers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Real numbers ===
The uncountability of the [[real number]]s was already established by [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]], but it also follows from the above result. To prove this, an [[injective function|injection]] will be constructed from the set ''T'' of infinite binary strings to the set '''R''' of real numbers. Since ''T'' is uncountable, the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of this function, which is a subset of '''R''', is uncountable. Therefore, '''R''' is uncountable. Also, by using a method of construction devised by Cantor, a [[bijection]] will be constructed between ''T'' and '''R'''. Therefore, ''T'' and '''R''' have the same cardinality, which is called the "[[cardinality of the continuum]]" and is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

An injection from ''T'' to '''R'''  is given by mapping strings in ''T'' to decimals, such as mapping ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0111… to the decimal 0.0111…. This function, defined by {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}(''t'') {{=}} 0.''t''}}, is an injection because it maps different strings to different numbers. 

Instead of mapping 0111… to the decimal 0.0111…, it can be mapped to the [[radix|base]] ''b'' number: 0.0111…&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;. This leads to the family of functions: {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}}(''t'') {{=}} 0.''t''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The functions {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} are injections, except for {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}}. This function will be modified to produce a bijection between ''T'' and '''R'''.

This construction uses a method devised by Cantor that was published in 1878. He used it to construct a bijection between the [[closed interval]] [0, 1] and the [[irrational number|irrational]]s in the [[open interval]] (0,&amp;nbsp;1). He first removed a [[countably infinite]] subset from each of these sets so that there is a bijection between the remaining uncountable sets. Since there is a bijection between the countably infinite subsets that have been removed, combining the two bijections produces a bijection between the original sets.&lt;ref&gt;See page 254 of {{Citation|author=Georg Cantor|title=Ein Beitrag zur Mannigfaltigkeitslehre|url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=GDZPPN002156806|volume=84|pages=242&amp;ndash;258|journal=Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik|year=1878}}. This proof is discussed in {{Citation|author=Joseph Dauben|title=Georg Cantor: His Mathematics and Philosophy of the Infinite|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1979|isbn=0-674-34871-0}}, pp. 61&amp;ndash;62, 65. On page 65, Dauben proves a result that is stronger than Cantor's. He lets "''φ&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote any sequence of rationals in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]." Cantor lets ''φ&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote a sequence [[Enumeration|enumerating]] the rationals in [0,&amp;nbsp;1], which is the kind of sequence needed for his construction of a bijection between [0,&amp;nbsp;1] and the irrationals in (0,&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor's method can be used to modify the function {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') {{=}} 0.''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} to produce a bijection from ''T'' to (0,&amp;nbsp;1). Because some numbers have two binary expansions, {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} is not even [[injective function|injective]]. For example, {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1000…) {{=}}}} 0.1000…&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1/2 and {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(0111…) {{=}}}} 0.0111…&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|[[Infinite series|1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + …]] {{=}}}} 1/2, so both 1000… and 0111… map to the same number, 1/2. 

To modify {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}}(''t'')}}, observe that it is a bijection except for a countably infinite subset of (0,&amp;nbsp;1) and a countably infinite subset of ''T''. It is not a bijection for the numbers in (0,&amp;nbsp;1) that have two [[binary expansion]]s. These are called [[dyadic_rational|dyadic]] numbers and have the form {{nowrap|''m''{{space|hair}}/{{space|hair}}2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} where ''m'' is an odd integer and ''n'' is a natural number. Put these numbers in the sequence: ''r''&amp;nbsp;= (1/2, 1/4, 3/4, 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8,&amp;nbsp;…). Also, {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}}(''t'')}} is not a bijection to (0,&amp;nbsp;1) for the strings in ''T'' appearing after the [[binary point]] in the binary expansions of 0, 1, and the numbers in sequence ''r''. Put these eventually-constant strings in the sequence: ''s''&amp;nbsp;= ({{color|#808080|000}}…, {{color|#808080|111}}…, 1{{color|#808080|000}}…, 0{{color|#808080|111}}…, 01{{color|#808080|000}}…, 00{{color|#808080|111}}…, 11{{color|#808080|000}}…, 10{{color|#808080|111}}…,&amp;nbsp;...). Define the bijection ''g''(''t'') from ''T'' to (0,&amp;nbsp;1): If ''t'' is the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; string in sequence ''s'', let ''g''(''t'') be the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; number in sequence ''r''{{space|hair}}; otherwise, ''g''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

To construct a bijection from ''T'' to '''R''', start with the [[trigonometric functions|tangent function]] tan(''x''), which is a bijection from (−π/2,&amp;nbsp;π/2) to '''R''' (see the figure shown on the right). Next observe that the [[linear function]] ''h''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|π''x'' – π/2}} is a bijection from (0,&amp;nbsp;1) to (−π/2,&amp;nbsp;π/2) (see the figure shown on the left). The [[function composition|composite function]] tan(''h''(''x''))&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|tan(π''x'' – π/2)}} is a bijection from (0,&amp;nbsp;1) to '''R'''. Composing this function with ''g''(''t'') produces the function tan(''h''(''g''(''t'')))&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|tan(π''g''(''t'') – π/2)}}, which is a bijection from ''T'' to '''R'''.

== General sets ==
[[File:Diagonal argument powerset svg.svg|thumb|250px|Illustration of the generalized diagonal argument: The set ''T'' = {''n''∈ℕ: ''n''∉''f''(''n'')} at the bottom cannot occur anywhere in the range of ''f'':[[natural number|ℕ]]→[[power set|'''''P''''']](ℕ). The example mapping ''f'' happens to correspond to the example enumeration ''s'' in the [[#Lead|above]] picture.]]
A generalized form of the diagonal argument was used by Cantor to prove [[Cantor's theorem]]: for every [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'', the [[power set]] of ''S''—that is, the set of all [[subset]]s of ''S'' (here written as '''''P'''''(''S''))—has a larger cardinality than ''S'' itself. This proof proceeds as follows:

Let ''f'' be any [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from ''S'' to '''''P'''''(''S'').  It suffices to prove ''f'' cannot be [[surjective]]. That means that some member ''T'' of '''''P'''''(''S''), i.e. some subset of ''S'', is not in the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of ''f''.  As a candidate consider the set:

:''T'' = { ''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''s'' ∉ ''f''(''s'') }.

For every ''s'' in ''S'', either ''s'' is in ''T'' or not. If ''s'' is in ''T'', then by definition of ''T'', ''s'' is not in ''f''(''s''), so ''T'' is not equal to ''f''(''s''). On the other hand,  if ''s'' is not in ''T'', then by definition of ''T'', ''s'' is in ''f''(''s''), so again ''T'' is not equal to ''f''(''s''); cf. picture.
For a more complete account of this proof, see [[Cantor's theorem]].

===Consequences===
This result implies that the notion of the [[set of all sets]] is an inconsistent notion.  If ''S'' were the set of all sets then '''''P'''''(''S'') would at the same time be bigger than ''S'' and a subset of ''S''.

[[Russell's Paradox]] has shown us that [[naive set theory]], based on an [[unrestricted comprehension]] scheme, is contradictory.  Note that there is a similarity between the construction of ''T'' and the set in Russell's paradox. Therefore, depending on how we modify the axiom scheme of comprehension in order to avoid Russell's paradox, arguments such as the non-existence of a set of all sets may or may not remain valid.

The diagonal argument shows that the set of real numbers is "bigger" than the set of natural numbers (and therefore, the integers and rationals as well). Therefore, we can ask if there is a set whose [[cardinality]] is "between" that of the integers and that of the reals. This question leads to the famous [[continuum hypothesis]]. Similarly, the question of whether there exists a set whose cardinality is between |''S''| and |'''''P'''''(''S'')| for some infinite ''S'' leads to the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]].

Analogues of the diagonal argument are widely used in mathematics to prove the existence or nonexistence of certain objects.  For example, the conventional proof of the unsolvability of the [[halting problem]] is essentially a diagonal argument.  Also, diagonalization was originally used to show the existence of arbitrarily hard [[complexity classes]] and played a key role in early attempts to prove [[P versus NP|P does not equal NP]].

===Version for Quine's New Foundations===
The above proof fails for [[W. V. Quine]]'s "[[New Foundations]]" set theory (NF). In NF, the [[unrestricted comprehension|naive axiom scheme of comprehension]] is modified to avoid the paradoxes by introducing a kind of "local" [[type theory]].  In this axiom scheme,

:{ ''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''s'' ∉ ''f''(''s'') }

is ''not'' a set — i.e., does not satisfy the axiom scheme.  On the other hand, we might try to create a modified diagonal argument by noticing that

:{ ''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''s'' ∉ ''f''({''s''}) }

''is'' a set in NF.  In which case, if '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') is the set of one-element subsets of ''S'' and ''f'' is a proposed bijection from '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') to '''''P'''''(''S''), one is able to use [[proof by contradiction]] to prove that |'''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')| &amp;lt; |'''''P'''''(''S'')|.

The proof follows by the fact that if ''f'' were indeed a map ''onto'' '''''P'''''(''S''), then we could find ''r'' in ''S'', such that  ''f''({''r''}) coincides with the modified diagonal set, above.  We would conclude that if ''r'' is not in ''f''({''r''}), then ''r'' is in ''f''({''r''}) and vice versa.

It is ''not'' possible to put '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') in a one-to-one relation with ''S'', as the two have different types, and so any function so defined would violate the typing rules for the comprehension scheme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">'''Cement chemist notation''' ('''CCN''') was developed to simplify the [[formula]]s [[cement]] chemists use on a daily basis. It is a shorthand way of writing the [[chemical formula]] of [[oxide]]s of [[calcium]], [[silicon]], and various [[metal]]s.

==Abbreviations of oxides==

The main oxides present in cement (or in glass and ceramics) are abbreviated in the following way:

{|class="wikitable"
!CCN!!Actual formula!!Name
|-
|C||CaO||[[Calcium oxide]], or [[Lime (material)|lime]]
|-
|S||SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Silicon dioxide]], or [[silica]]
|-
|A||Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Aluminium oxide]], or [[alumina]]
|-
|F||Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Iron oxide]], or [[rust]]
|-
|T||TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Titanium dioxide]], or titania
|-
|M||MgO||[[Magnesium oxide]], or [[periclase]]
|-
|K||K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O||[[Potassium oxide]]
|-
|N||Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O||[[Sodium oxide]]
|-
|H||H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O||[[Water]]
|-
|{{overline|C}}||CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Carbon dioxide]]
|-
|{{overline|S}}||SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Sulfur trioxide]]
|-
|P||P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Phosphorus pentoxide|Phosphorus hemi-pentoxide]]
|}

==Conversion of hydroxides in oxide and free water==
For the sake of mass balance calculations, hydroxides present in hydrated phases found in hardened cement paste, such as in [[portlandite]], Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, must first be converted into oxide and water.

To better understand the conversion process of hydroxide anions in oxide and water, it is necessary to consider the autoprotolysis of the [[hydroxyl]] anions; it implies a [[proton]] exchange between two OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, like in a classical [[acid-base reaction]]:

:{{underset|acid 1|OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}} + {{underset|base 2|OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}} → {{underset|base 1|O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;}} + {{underset|acid 2|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}
or also,
:2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

For [[portlandite]] this gives thus the following mass balance:

:Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CaO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Thus portlandite can be written as CaO · H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or CH.

==Main phases in Portland cement before and after hydration==

These oxides are used to build more complex [[Compound (chemistry)|compounds]]. The main crystalline phases described hereafter are related respectively to the composition of: 
* Clinker and non-hydrated Portland cement, and; 
* Hardened cement pastes obtained after hydration and cement setting.

===Clinker and non-hydrated Portland cement===

Four main phases are present in the [[clinker (cement)|clinker]] and in the non-hydrated Portland [[cement]]. &lt;br /&gt;They are formed at high temperature (1,450&amp;nbsp;°C) in the [[cement kiln]] and are the following:

{|class="wikitable"
!CCN!!Actual formula!!Name!!Mineral phase
|-
|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S||3 CaO · SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||Tricalcium silicate||[[Alite]]
|-
|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S||2 CaO · SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||[[calcium silicate|Dicalcium silicate]]||[[Belite]]
|-
|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A||3 CaO · Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Tricalcium aluminate]]||[[Tricalcium aluminate|Aluminate]] or Celite
|-
|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;AF||4 CaO · Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; · Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||Tetracalcium alumino ferrite||[[Calcium Aluminoferrite|Ferrite]]
|}

The four compounds referred as C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A and C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;AF are known as the main crystalline phases of Portland cement. The phase composition of a particular cement can be quantified through a complex set of calculation known as the [[Bogue formula]].

===Hydrated cement paste===

[[Hydration reaction|Hydration]] products formed in hardened cement pastes (also known as HCPs) are more complicated, because many of these products have nearly the same formula and some are solid solutions with overlapping formulas. Some examples are given below:

{|class="wikitable"
!CCN !! Actual formula !! Name or mineral phase
|-
|[[Portlandite|CH]]||Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or CaO · H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O||[[Calcium hydroxide]]
|-
||[[Calcium silicate hydrate|C-S-H]]||0.6–2.0 CaO · SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · 0.9–2.5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, with variable composition within this range, and often also incorporating partial substitution of Al for Si||[[Calcium silicate hydrate]]
|-
|[[Calcium Aluminate Hydrate|C-A-H]]||This is even more complex than C-S-H||Calcium aluminate hydrate
|-
|[[AFt phase|AFt]]||C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;A{{overline|S}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;, sometimes with substitution of Fe for Al, and/or [[Carbonate|{{chem|CO|3|2-}}]] for [[Sulfate|{{chem|SO|4|2-}}]]||calcium trisulfoaluminate hydrate, or [[ettringite]]
|-
|[[AFm phase|AFm]]||C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;A{{overline|S}}H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, often with substitution of Fe for Al, and/or various other anions such as OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or {{chem|CO|3|2-}} for {{chem|SO|4|2-}} ||Calcium monosulfoaluminate
|-
|[[Hydrogarnet|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AH&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]||3CaO · Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O||[[Hydrogarnet]]
|}

The hyphens in C-S-H indicate a calcium silicate hydrate phase of variable composition, while 'CSH' would indicate a calcium silicate phase, CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Use in ceramics, glass, and oxide chemistry==
The cement chemist notation is not restricted to cement applications but is in fact a more general notation of oxide chemistry applicable to other domains than cement chemistry ''sensu stricto''.

For instance, in [[ceramic]]s applications, the [[kaolinite]] formula can also be written in terms of oxides, thus the corresponding formula for kaolinite, 
:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,

is
:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; · 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

or in CCN
:AS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Possible use of CCN in mineralogy==
Although not a very developed practice in mineralogy, some chemical reactions involving silicate and oxide in the melt or in hydrothermal systems, and silicate weathering processes could also be successfully described by applying the cement chemist notation to silicate mineralogy.

An example could be the formal comparison of [[Belite#Hydration|belite hydration]] and [[forsterite]] [[Serpentinite#Serpentinite_reactions|serpentinisation]] dealing both with the hydration of two structurally similar earth -alkaline silicates, Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

;Calcium system: [[Belite#Hydration|belite hydration]]:
{{NumBlk|::
|{{overset|[[Belite]]|2 Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{overset|water|4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}} → {{overset|C-S-H phase|3 CaO · 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}} + {{overset|[[portlandite]]|Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
|{{EquationRef|Reaction 4a}}}}
{{NumBlk|::
|2 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4 H → C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CH
|{{EquationRef|Reaction 4b}}}}

;Magnesium system: [[forsterite]] [[Serpentinite#Serpentinite_reactions|serpentinisation]]:
{{NumBlk|::
|{{overset|Forsterite|2 Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{overset|water|3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}} → {{overset|[[serpentinite|serpentine]] |Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{overset|[[brucite]]|Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
|{{EquationRef|Reaction 4c}}}}
{{NumBlk|::
|2 M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 3 H → M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + MH
|{{EquationRef|Reaction 4d}}}}

The ratio Ca/Si (C/S) and Mg/Si (M/S) decrease from 2 for the dicalcium and dimagnesium silicate reagents to 1.5 for the hydrated silicate products of the hydration reaction. In other term, the C-S-H or the serpentine are less rich in Ca and Mg respectively. This is why the reaction leads to the elimination of the excess of [[portlandite]] (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[brucite]] (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), respectively,  out of the silicate system, giving rise to the crystallization of both hydroxides as separate phases.

The rapid reaction of [[belite]] hydration in the setting of [[cement]] is formally "chemically analogue" to the slow natural hydration of [[forsterite]] (the magnesium end-member of [[olivine]]) leading to the formation of [[serpentinite|serpentine]] and [[brucite]] in nature. However, the kinetic of hydration of poorly crystallized artificial belite is much swifter than the slow conversion/weathering of well crystallized Mg-[[olivine]] under natural conditions.

This comparison suggests that mineralogists could probably also benefit from the concise formalism of the cement chemist notation in their works.

A '''constitutional right''' can be a prerogative or a duty, a power or a restraint of power, recognized and established by a [[sovereign state]] or union of states. All constitutional [[rights]] are expressly stipulated and written in a consolidated national [[constitution]], which is the supreme law of the land, meaning that any other laws which are in contradiction with it are considered unconstitutional and thus regarded as invalid. Usually any constitution defines the structure, functions, powers, and limits of the national government and the individual freedoms, rights, and obligations which will be protected and enforced when needed by the national authorities.

Nowadays, most countries have a written constitution comprising similar or distinct constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://constitutionalrights.constitutioncenter.org/app/home/world/|title= Constitutional Rights Origins and Travels|access-date=29 July 2015}} )&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1789, along with the [[Constitution of the United States of America]] (hereinafter U.S. Constitution), which is the oldest and shortest written constitution still in force,&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last=Jordan |first=Terry L.|title= The U.S. Constitution and Fascinating Facts About It, 8th Edition |publisher= Oak Hill Publishing Company |place=Naperville IL|year=2013|page=25}})&lt;/ref&gt; around 220 other similar constitutions were adopted around the world by independent states.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/November%2019%20Ginsburg%20Melton%20Innovation%20in%20Constitutional%20Rights%20.pdf/|title=Innovation in Constitutional Rights, |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Melton |first2=James |publisher=Draft for presentation at NYU Workshop on Law, Economics and Politics|website=NYU |access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, [[Thomas Jefferson]] predicted that a period of 20 years will be the optimal time for any Constitution to still be in force since "the earth belongs to the living, and not to the dead." &lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch2s23.html/|title=Thomas Jefferson to James Madison |publisher=Papers 15:392--97|date=6 September 1789 |website=Popular Basis of Political Authority|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidence or not, according to recent studies &lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/November%2019%20Ginsburg%20Melton%20Innovation%20in%20Constitutional%20Rights%20.pdf/|title=Innovation in Constitutional Rights, |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Melton |first2=James |publisher=Draft for presentation at NYU Workshop on Law, Economics and Politics|website=NYU |access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Zachary, |first1=Elkins|last2=Ginsburg |first2=Tom|last3=Melton|first3=James| title= The Endurance of National Constitutions|publisher= Cambridge University Press. |place=New York|year=2009}})&lt;/ref&gt; the average life expectancy of any new written constitution is around 19 years. However, a great number of constitutions do not exceed more than 10 years and around 10% do not last more than 1 year, as it was the case of the [[France|French]] Constitution from 1971&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/November%2019%20Ginsburg%20Melton%20Innovation%20in%20Constitutional%20Rights%20.pdf/|title=Innovation in Constitutional Rights, |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Melton |first2=James |publisher=Draft for presentation at NYU Workshop on Law, Economics and Politics|website=NYU |access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Zachary, |first1=Elkins|last2=Ginsburg |first2=Tom|last3=Melton|first3=James| title= The Endurance of National Constitutions|publisher= Cambridge University Press. |place=New York|year=2009}})&lt;/ref&gt; and not only.

The most common reasons for these continuous changes are the political desire of an immediate outcome and the scarcity of time devoted to the constitutional drafting process.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/November%2019%20Ginsburg%20Melton%20Innovation%20in%20Constitutional%20Rights%20.pdf/|title=Innovation in Constitutional Rights, |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Melton |first2=James |publisher=Draft for presentation at NYU Workshop on Law, Economics and Politics|website=NYU |access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; A study from 2009 showed that the average time allocated for the drafting part of the process is around 16 months &lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://lexglobal.org/files/Does%20the%20Process%20of%20Constitution-Making%20Matter.pdf/|title=Does the Process of Constitution-Making Matter?|last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Zachary, |first2=Elkins |last3=Blount, |first3=Justin |publisher=Annu. Rev. Law Soc. Sci.5:201–23|website=University of Chicago Law School |date=2009|place=Chicago, IL|page=209|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt;  however there were also some extreme cases registered. For example, the [[Myanmar]] 2008 Constitution was secretly drafted for more than 17 years,&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/November%2019%20Ginsburg%20Melton%20Innovation%20in%20Constitutional%20Rights%20.pdf/|title=Innovation in Constitutional Rights, |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Melton |first2=James |publisher=Draft for presentation at NYU Workshop on Law, Economics and Politics|website=NYU |access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; whereas on the other extreme, like the case of the [[Japan]]'s 1946 Constitution, the bureaucrats drafted everything in no more than a week.Nevertheless, the record for the shortest overall process of drafting, adoption and ratification of a national Constitution belongs to the [[Romania]]'s 1938 Constitution which installed a royal dictatorship in less than a month.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://lexglobal.org/files/Does%20the%20Process%20of%20Constitution-Making%20Matter.pdf/|title=Does the Process of Constitution-Making Matter?|last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Zachary, |first2=Elkins |last3=Blount, |first3=Justin |publisher=Annu.

Sci.5:201–23|website=University of Chicago Law School |date=2009|place=Chicago, IL|page=204|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on the matter showed as a general conclusion that usually non-democracies where the registered extreme cases where the constitution-making process either takes too long or is incredibly short.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://lexglobal.org/files/Does%20the%20Process%20of%20Constitution-Making%20Matter.pdf/|title=Does the Process of Constitution-Making Matter?|last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Zachary, |first2=Elkins |last3=Blount, |first3=Justin |publisher=Annu.

Sci.5:201–23|website=University of Chicago Law School |date=2009|place=Chicago, IL|page=203|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; Important not to forget or make any confusions about it is that constitutional rights are not a specific  characteristic of democratic countries, but also non-democratic countries have Constitutions, such as [[North Korea]] for example, which officially grants every citizen, among other rights, the [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| ssrn=2477530|title=Do Constitutional Rights Make a Difference?|last1= Chilton |first1=Adam S. |last2=Versteeg |first2=Mila |publisher=Coase-Sandor Institute for Law &amp; Economics Working Paper No. 694|website=Coase-Sandor Institute for Law &amp; Economics  |date=2014|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Other coded set of laws have existed before the first Constitutions were developed having some similar purpose and functions, like the United Kingdom's 1215 [[Magna Carta]] or the Virginia Bill of Rights of 1776.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/November%2019%20Ginsburg%20Melton%20Innovation%20in%20Constitutional%20Rights%20.pdf/|title=Innovation in Constitutional Rights, |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Melton |first2=James |publisher=Draft for presentation at NYU Workshop on Law, Economics and Politics|website=NYU |page=2|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

===Federal constitution===

On September 17, 1787 the [[United States Constitution]] was signed during the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)]] which took place at the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia, now the [[Independence Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Jordan, |first1=Terry L.| title= The U.S. Constitution and Fascinating Facts About It, 8th Ed.|publisher= Oak Hill Publishing Company|place= Naperville IL |year=2013 |page=31}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest person signing the Constitution was [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the founding fathers, being 81 years old at the time and requesting assistance during the process, whereas the youngest one was [[Jonathan Dayton]] from New Jersey, being only 26 years old. [[James Madison]] and [[George Washington]] were the only two signers that later became Presidents of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Jordan, |first1=Terry L.| title= The U.S. Constitution and Fascinating Facts About It, 8th Ed.|publisher= Oak Hill Publishing Company|place= Naperville IL |year=2013 |page=26}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the first fascinating fact about the U.S. Constitution is its length, containing only 4.400 words and thus being the shortest and oldest written Constitution in the world.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Jordan, |first1=Terry L.| title= The U.S. Constitution and Fascinating Facts About It, 8th Ed.|publisher= Oak Hill Publishing Company|place= Naperville IL |year=2013 |page=25}})&lt;/ref&gt; Only on December 15, 1791 the Bill of Rights comprising the first 10 Amendments became part of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Jordan, |first1=Terry L.| title= The U.S. Constitution and Fascinating Facts About It, 8th Ed.|publisher= Oak Hill Publishing Company|place= Naperville IL |year=2013 |page=45}})&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, other 17 Amendments were added. Thus, the U.S Constitution is summing a total of 27 Amendments and 7 Articles. During all this time, only one amendment overturned a previous one, more precisely the twenty-first Amendment ratified on December 5, 1933 repealed the [[prohibition of alcohol]] established by the eighteenth Amendment on January 16, 1919.

The provisions providing for rights under the Bill of Rights were originally binding upon only the federal government. In time, most of these provisions became binding upon the states through [[selective incorporation]] into the [[due process clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]. When a provision is made binding on a state, a state can no longer restrict the rights guaranteed in that provision.

Examples of provisions made binding upon the states are the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution which was made "fully applicable" by being Incorporated with the 14th Amendment in 2010, see, McDonald vs. City of Chicago; the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|6th Amendment]]'s guarantee of a right to confrontation of witnesses, known as the [[Confrontation Clause]], and the various provisions of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment]], guaranteeing the freedoms of speech, the press, government and assembly.

For example, the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protects the right to [[grand jury]] proceedings in federal criminal cases. However, because this right was not selectively incorporated into the due process clause of the 14th amendment, it is not binding upon the states. Therefore, persons involved in state criminal proceedings as a defendant have no federal constitutional right to grand jury proceedings. Whether an individual has a right to a grand jury becomes a question of state law.

The content of each Article and Amendment of the U.S. Constitution is easy to predict since they start with a suggestive title. For example, the [[First Amendment]] guarantees the freedom of religion, speech, and the press along with the rights of assembly and petition, the Second Amendment the right to bear arms and so on. However, in order to be easier to distinguish, the legal professionals have divided the constitutional rights into two categories: process rights and [[substantive rights]].&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Feinman, |first1=Jay M.| title= Law 101, 4th Ed.|publisher= Oxford University Press|place= New York |year=2014 |page=49}})&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas, the process rights refer to the powers and obligations of the government with respect to individuals, the substantive rights, more diverse than the process ones, incorporate the individual freedoms granted and protected by the national government.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Feinman, |first1=Jay M.| title= Law 101, 4th Ed.|publisher= Oxford University Press|place= New York |year=2014 |pages=50–51}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===State constitutions===

Each of the United States has its own governing Constitution. The States Constitutions are usually longer and written in much more detail than the U.S. Constitution. For example, the [[Alabama]] Constitution has more than 600 pages and the [[New Jersey]] Constitution of 1947 is three times longer than the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book|last1=Feinman, |first1=Jay M.| title= Law 101, 4th Ed.|publisher= Oxford University Press|place= New York |year=2014 |page=12}})&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this difference between the federal Constitution and the states Constitutions is what Justice Brennan called 'the new judicial federalism'.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web| url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/4649/|title=Justice Brennan and Federalism |last=Post |first=Robert |publisher=Faculty Scholarship Series. Paper 4649. |website=Faculty Scholarship Series|date=1990|access-date=29 July 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that rights granted by the States Constitutions can be broader than those comprised by the federal Constitution but not narrowed.

State constitutions cannot reduce legal protections afforded by the federal charter, but they can provide additional protections. ''California v. Ramos'', 463 U.S. 992, 1014, 103 S.Ct. 3446, 77 l.Ed.2d 1171 (1983).  Even where the text of a state constitution matches verbatim that of the federal constitution, the state document may be held to provide more to the citizen.  State constitutional rights can also include those entirely unaddressed in the federal constitution, such as the right to adequate education or the right to affordable housing.

==Other nations==
{{expand section|date=February 2012}}
{{See also|Human rights in Germany|Constitution of Japan}}
Many other [[democracy|democratic]] nations have followed the US model in enshrining certain rights in their constitutions. Countries whose written constitutions include a [[bill of rights]] include [[Germany]], [[India]] and [[Japan]].

The United Kingdom, as it has an [[uncodified constitution]], does not have a constitutional bill of rights, although the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] fulfills a similar role.

The [[European Convention of Human Rights]] applies in those nations which are members of the [[Council of Europe]]. Persons who have experienced Convention-infringing human rights violations on the territory of ECHR-signatory nations can appeal to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

In [[authoritarian]] regimes there are generally few or no guaranteed inalienable rights; alternatively, such rights may exist but be unobserved in practice (as was generally the case in the former [[Francoist Spain]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3232">'''Dawson casting''' is an observed [[Bandwagon effect|cultural phenomenon]] and [[Trope (cinema)|movie trope]] in [[film]] and [[television]] where many of the actors appear, and in reality are, much older than the characters they are portraying. The concept is observable in [[teen drama]]s such as ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', and ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'' where grown adults are cast to play teenage characters.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web|title=When adult actors play teenagers|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-28687403|publisher=BBC News|date=7 August 2014|author=Harry Low|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fsr"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Why Teenagers Need to Play Teenagers on Screen|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/why-teenagers-need-to-play-teenagers-on-screen-40c659381a8/|author=Samantha Wilson|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="screenrant"&gt;{{cite web|title=15 Older Actors Who Played Teenagers In TV And Movies|url=https://screenrant.com/older-actors-playing-teenagers-movies-tv/|publisher=Screenrant.com|author=Katherine Webb|date=8 June 2016|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside the Phenomenon of Grown Adults Playing Teenagers on TV|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/evgzvj/inside-the-phenomenon-of-grown-adults-playing-teenagers-on-tv|publisher=VICE|author=Linda Yang|date=5 May 2017|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally circulated on the Internet in response to the casting choices in ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''.&lt;ref name=vice /&gt;&lt;ref name="tvtropes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dawson Casting|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting|publisher=TvTropes|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social ramifications==
It has been suggested on several occasions by critics that Dawson casting has several negative implications, specifically for adolescents. These commonly include accusations of [[Physical attractiveness|unrealistic beauty standards]], negative [[body image]], low [[self-esteem]], and general [[Mental disorder|mental health problems]], especially in regards to one's self-perception.&lt;ref name="fsr"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teenvogue"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Problem With Teen Characters Being Played by Adults|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/problem-teen-characters-played-by-adults|publisher=TeenVogue.com|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clinical psychologist, Barbara Greenberg, told ''[[Teen Vogue]]'' that casting twenty-year-old actors for the roles of high-school students can worsen the struggles of adolescents, stating "It can give the message that they’re supposed to look good all the time" adding "That leads to all kinds of body-image and social-comparison issues".&lt;ref name="teenvogue"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*In an episode of ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', Jack acknowledges the phenomenon when he exclaims "This is just like ''[[The O.C.]]'', except without 25-year-old teenagers and 35-year-old parents".&lt;ref name="tvtropes" /&gt;

In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], for any object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in any [[category (mathematics)|category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; where the [[product (category theory)|product]] &lt;math&gt;a\times a&lt;/math&gt; exists, [[there exists]] the '''diagonal morphism''' 

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_a : a \rightarrow a \times a&lt;/math&gt;

satisfying 

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_k \circ \delta_a = id_a&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k \in \{ 1,2 \},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\pi_k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[canonical projection morphism]] to the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th component. The existence of this morphism is a consequence of the [[universal property]] which [[characterization (mathematics)|characterize]]s the product ([[up to]] [[isomorphism]]). The restriction to binary products here is for ease of notation; diagonal morphisms exist similarly for arbitrary products. The [[image (category theory)|image]] of a diagonal morphism in the [[category of sets]], as a [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]], is a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] on the [[domain of a function|domain]], namely [[equality (mathematics)|equality]].

For [[concrete categories]], the diagonal morphism can be simply described by its action on elements &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Namely, &lt;math&gt;\delta_a(x) = \langle x,x \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, the [[ordered pair]] formed from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The reason for the name is that the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of such a diagonal morphism is diagonal (whenever it makes sense), for example the image of the diagonal morphism &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; on the [[real line]] is given by the line which is a [[graph of a function|graph]] of the equation &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt;. The diagonal morphism into the [[infinite product]] &lt;math&gt;X^\infty&lt;/math&gt; may provide an [[Injective function|injection]] into the [[space of sequences]] valued in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;; each element maps to the constant [[sequence]] at that element. However, most notions of sequence spaces have [[convergent series|convergence]] restrictions which the image of the diagonal map will fail to satisfy.

'''Digital Life''' is a research and educational program about radically rethinking of the [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interactive experience]]. It integrates [[digital world]] (information &amp; services) and physical world (physical objects/environment). It makes interfaces more responsive and proactive (objects &amp; environments monitor user and (proactively) present information &amp; services relevant to user’s current needs/interests)

The program is to use [[information technology]] to augment physical environments and objects around the people that can draw attention. When one is walking around town, for example, the system points out buildings/places of particular interest to a user. The program is also to augment reality in order to provide a composite view for the participants: a mix of a real scene with the virtual scene that augments the digital environment with interactive information.

The Program was originally initiated by [[MIT Media Lab]] as: Digital Life is a multi-sponsor, Lab-wide research consortium that conducts basic research on technologies and techniques that spur expression as well as social and economic activity. They first explore the design and scalability of agile, grassroots communications systems that incorporate a growing understanding of emergent social behaviors in a [[digital world]]; the second considers a cognitive architecture that can support many features of “human intelligent thinking” and its expressive and economic use; and the third extends the idea of inclusive design to immersive, affective, and biological interfaces and actions.

'''Epistemic closure'''&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |author=Luper, Steven |title=The Epistemic Closure Principle |date=31 December 2001 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/closure-epistemic/#CloPri}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[property (philosophy)|property]] of some [[belief system]]s. It is the [[concept|principle]] that if a subject &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; knows &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; knows that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; [[Logical consequence|entails]] &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can thereby come to know &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Most [[epistemology|epistemological]] [[philosophical theory|theories]] involve a closure principle and many [[Skepticism|skeptical]] [[argument]]s assume a closure principle.

On the other hand, some epistemologists, including [[Robert Nozick]], have denied closure principles on the basis of [[reliabilism|reliabilist]] accounts of knowledge. Nozick, in ''[[Philosophical Explanations]]'', advocated that, when considering the [[Gettier problem]], the least counter-intuitive assumption we give up should be epistemic closure. Nozick suggested a "truth tracking" theory of knowledge, in which the x was said to know P if x's belief in P tracked the truth of P through the relevant [[modal logic|modal scenarios]].&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical explanations'',  By Robert Nozick (Harvard 1981), page 204&lt;/ref&gt;

A subject may not actually believe &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt;, for example, regardless of whether he or she is justified or warranted. Thus, one might instead say that knowledge is closed under ''known'' deduction: if, while knowing &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; believes &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; because &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; knows that &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; entails &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt;, then &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; knows &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; An even stronger formulation would be as such: If, while knowing various propositions, &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; believes &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; because &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; knows that these propositions entail &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;, then &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; knows &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; While the principle of epistemic closure is generally regarded as intuitive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brady, Michael |author2=Pritchard, Duncan |title=Epistemological Contextualism: Problems and Prospects |journal=[[The Philosophical Quarterly]] |volume=55 |issue=219 |pages=161–171 |year=2005 |doi=10.1111/j.0031-8094.2005.00393.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0031-8094.2005.00393.x/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; philosophers such as [[Robert Nozick]] and [[Fred Dretske]] have argued against it.

== Epistemic closure and skeptical arguments ==
The epistemic closure principle typically takes the form of a [[modus ponens]] argument:

# S knows p.
# S knows that p entails q.
# Therefore, S knows q.

This epistemic closure principle is central to many versions of skeptical arguments.  A [[Skepticism|skeptical]] argument of this type will involve knowledge of some piece of widely accepted information to be knowledge, which will then be pointed out to entail knowledge of some skeptical scenario, such as the [[brain in a vat]] scenario or the [[Evil demon|cartesian evil demon]] scenario.  A skeptic might say, for example, that if you know that you have hands, then you know that you are not a handless brain in a vat (because knowledge that you have hands implies that you know you are not handless, and if you know that you are not handless, then you know that you are not a handless brain in a vat).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sosa|first=Ernest|date=1999-10-01|title=How to Defeat Opposition to Moore|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0029-4624.33.s13.7/abstract|journal=Noûs|language=en|volume=33|pages=141–153|doi=10.1111/0029-4624.33.s13.7|issn=1468-0068}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The skeptic will then utilize this conditional to form a [[modus tollens]] argument.  For example, the skeptic might make an argument like the following:
# You do not know that you are not a handless brain in a vat (~K(~h))
# If you know that you have hands, then you know that you are not a handless brain in a vat (K(o) → K(~h))
# '''Conclusion:''' Therefore, you do not know that you have hands (~K(o))
Much of the epistemological discussion surrounding this type of skeptical argument involves whether to accept or deny the conclusion, and how to do each.  [[Ernest Sosa]] says that there are three possibilities in responding to the skeptic:
# Agree with the skeptic by granting him both premises and the conclusion (1, 2, c)
# Disagree with the skeptic by denying premise 2 and the conclusion, but maintaining premise 1 (1, ~2, ~c) as [[Robert Nozick|Nozick]] and [[Fred Dretske|Dretske]] do.  This amounts to ''denying'' the epistemic closure principle.
# Disagree with the skeptic by denying premise 1 and the conclusion, but maintaining premise 2 (~1, 2, ~c) as [[G. E. Moore|Moore]] does.  This amounts to ''maintaining'' the epistemic closure principle, and holding that knowledge is closed under known [[Logical consequence|implication]].

== Justificatory closure == 
In the seminal 1963 paper, “[[Gettier problem|Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?]]”, Edmund Gettier gave an assumption (later called the “principle of deducibility for justification” by [[Irving Thalberg, Jr.]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thalberg Jr., Irving |title=In Defense of Justified True Belief |journal=[[Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=66 |issue=22 |pages=794–803 |date=November 1969 |jstor=2024370 |ref={{harvid|Thalberg|1969}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would serve as a basis for the rest of his piece: “for any proposition P, if S is justified in believing P and P entails Q, and S deduces Q from P and accepts Q as a result of this deduction, then S is justified in believing Q.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gettier, Edmund |title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge? |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=121–3 |date=June 1963 |jstor=3326922 |doi=10.1093/analys/23.6.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was seized upon by Thalberg, who rejected the principle in order to demonstrate that one of Gettier's examples fails to support Gettier's main thesis that justified true belief is not knowledge (in the following quotation, (1) refers to “Jones will get the job”, (2) refers to “Jones has ten coins”, and (3) is the [[logical conjunction]] of (1) and (2)):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why doesn't Gettier's principle (PDJ) hold in the evidential situation he has described? You multiply your risks of being wrong when you believe a conjunction. […&amp;nbsp;T]he most elementary theory of probability indicates that Smith's prospects of being right on both (1) and (2), namely, of being right on (3), are bound to be less favorable than his prospects of being right on either (1) or (2). In fact, Smith's chances of being right on (3) might not come up to the minimum standard of justification which (1) and (2) barely satisfy, and Smith would be unjustified in accepting (3). {{harv|Thalberg|1969|p=798}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Epistemic closure in U.S. political discussion ==
The term "epistemic closure" has been used in U.S. political debate to refer to the claim that political belief systems can be closed systems of deduction, unaffected by [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Epistemic Closure’?

{{Conservatism US}}
'''Family values''', sometimes referred to as '''familial values''', are [[tradition]]al or cultural [[values]] that pertain to the [[family]]'s structure, function, roles, beliefs, attitudes, and ideals.

In the social sciences and U.S. political discourse, the term "[[traditional family]]" refers to a nuclear family − a child-rearing environment composed of a [[breadwinner|breadwinning]] [[father]], a [[homemaking]] [[mother]], and their biological [[children]]; sociologists formerly referred to this model as the [[Social norm|norm]].{{fact|date=May 2018}} A family deviating from this model is considered a [[Non-traditional family|nontraditional family]].  However, in most cultures at most times, the [[extended family]] model has been most common, not the nuclear family,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2018/05/13/610777733/parenting-myths-and-facts Parenting Myths And Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; and the nuclear family became the most common form in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bebusinessed.com/history/history-nuclear-families/ History of Nuclear Families]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Several well-known online dictionaries define "family values" as the following:
* "the [[morality|moral]] and [[ethics|ethical]] principles traditionally upheld and passed on within a family, as honesty, loyalty, industry, and faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=family values|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/family+values|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "values especially of a traditional or [[Conservatism|conservative]] kind which are held to promote the sound functioning of the family and to strengthen the fabric of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=family values|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/family%20values|website=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "values held to be traditionally taught or reinforced within a family, such as those of high moral standards and discipline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=family values|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/family-values|website=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
{{Main|Familialism}}
[[Familialism]] or ''familism'' is the [[ideology]] that puts priority on [[family]] and family values.&lt;ref name=Ochiai&gt;{{cite book|title=Transformation of the Intimate and the Public in Asian Modernity. The Intimate and the Public in Asian and Global Perspectives|author=Emiko Ochiai, Leo Aoi Hosoya|publisher=BRILL|year=2014|isbn=9789004264359}} [url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JImIBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 Page 20-21]&lt;/ref&gt; Familialism prioritizes the needs of the family over the needs of individuals, and advocates for a welfare system where families, rather than the [[government]], take responsibility for the care of their members.&lt;ref name=Ochiai/&gt;

In the United States, the banner of "family values" has been used by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] to fight [[abortion]], [[LGBT rights|gay rights]], and major [[Feminism|feminist]] objectives in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dowland|first1=Seth|title=Family Values and the Rise of the Christian Right|date=2015|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812247602|url=to fight abortion, gay rights, and major feminist objectives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==
{{missing information|other cultures|date=November 2016}}

===Saudi culture===
Interpretations of [[Islam]]ic learnings and [[Arab culture]] are common for the majority of [[Saudi]]s. [[Islam]] is a driving cultural force that dictates a submission to the will of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peachy|first1=William S.|title=A brief look upon Islam|date=1999|publisher=Darussalam Publishers and Distributors|location=Riyadh, Saudi Arabia|pages=48|url=https://www.amazon.com/A-Brief-Look-Upon-Islam/dp/B00135EA0W|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic literature suggests that the family is regarded as the main foundation of Muslim society and culture; the family structure and nature of the relationship between family members are influenced by the Islamic religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mutair, A|author2=Plummer, V|author3=O'Brien, A|author4= Clerehan, R|authorlink1=Providing culturally congruent care for Saudi patients and their families|journal=Contemporary Nurse: A Journal For The Australian Nursing Profession|date=2014|volume=46|issue=2|pages=254–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage in Saudi culture means the union of two families, not just two individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Khalaf, I|author2=Callister, L|title=Cultural meanings of childbirth: Muslim women living in Jordan|journal=Journal of Holistic Nursing|date=1997|volume=4|issue=15|pages=373–388}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim society, marriage involves a social contract that occurs with the consent of [[parent]]s or guardians. Furthermore, marriage is considered the only legitimate outlet for [[sexual desire]]s, and sex outside marriage ([[fornication]]) is a crime that is punished under Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Lemu, A|author2=Heeren, F|title=Women in Islam|date=1992|publisher=The Islamic Foundation|location=Leicester, England|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of marriage is similar to the [[Western world|Western]] [[Christian]] view of marriage, created in 12th century [[France]], which promised [[salvation]], sex without sin, and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McDougall|first1= Sara|title= The Making of Marriage in Medieval France|journal=Journal of Family History|date= 2013|volume= 38|issue=2|pages= 103–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudi family includes extended families, as the [[extended family]] provides the individual with a sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. The father is often the [[:wikt:breadwinner|breadwinner]] and protector of the family, whereas the mother is often the [[homemaker]] and the primary caretaker of the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Luna|first1=J|title= Transcultural nursing care of Arab Muslims|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=1989|volume=1|issue=1|pages=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents are regarded with high respect, and children are strongly encouraged to respect and obey their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ghazwi, F.|author2= Nock, L.|authorlink1= Religion as mediating force in the effects of modernization on parent–child relations in Jordan|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=1989|volume=25|pages= 363–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, families provide care for elders. Until recently, because families and friends are expected to provide [[elderly care]], [[nursing home]]s were considered culturally unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luna|first1= J|title=Transcultural nursing care of Arab Muslims|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=1989|volume=1 |issue= 1|pages= 22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States culture===
In sociological terms, nontraditional families make up the majority of American households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Panasenko, N|title=Czech and Slovak Family Patterns and Family Values in Historical, Social and Cultural Context|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|date=2013|volume=44|issue=1|pages=79–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, only 46% of children in the U.S. live in a traditional family, down from 61% in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/22/less-than-half-of-u-s-kids-today-live-in-a-traditional-family/&lt;/ref&gt; This number includes only families with parents who are in their first marriage, whereas the percentage of children simply living with two married parents is 65% as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-192.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many who hold that the nuclear family is the fabric that holds society together&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bruderhof.com/en/our-faith/foundations/church-actions/marriage|title=Marriage|website=Bruderhof|language=en|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and work to promote stronger family values. The [[Chemin Neuf Community|Chemin Neuf]] community, the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Evangelical Alliance]] all work to promote the nuclear family.

[[File:The story of our Christianity; an account of the struggles, persecutions, wars, and victories of Christians of all times (1893) (14597346288).jpg|thumb|300x300px|Painting of the Spanish Inquisition where a woman is being prepared for foot roasting.]]

'''Foot roasting''' is a method of [[torture]] used since ancient times. The torture takes ingenious advantage of the extreme sensitivity of the sole of the foot to heat&lt;ref&gt;Schlee, G., ''et al.'', Foot sole skin temperature affects plantar foot sensitivity, ''Clinical Neurophysiology'' 120(8), August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Romans]] immobilized the prisoner and pressed red-hot iron plates to the soles of his feet. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] bound the prisoner face-upward to the rack with his bare feet secured in a [[stocks]]. The soles of the feet were basted with [[lard]] or oil and slowly barbecued over a [[brazier]] of burning coals. A screen could be interposed between the feet and the coals to modulate the exposure, while a [[bellows]] controlled the intensity of the flame. Variants included placing slivers of hot coals between the toes, or suspending the prisoner head-downward and placing hot coals directly on the soles. The destruction of the Order of the [[Knights Templars]] is credited to these tortures, which were of sufficient cruelty literally to drive their sufferers insane&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, John J.  ''Dungeon, Fire and Sword: The Knights Templars in the Crusades'', Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Foot roasting remains a popular technique of torture to this day.  During the Cold War, KGB torturers made use of metal [[clothes irons]] heated red-hot and applied directly to the naked soles or explored the delicate webbing between the prisoner's toes using either a [[soldering iron]] or an electric wood-burning pencil&lt;ref&gt;John Barron, ''KGB'' , New York: Bantam, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Knights Templar ==
Foot roasting was one of the principal tortures used to extract supposed confessions of [[heresy]] and other accusations made against the [[Knights Templar]] after their arrest in October 1307. It is recorded that one Templar's feet were so savagely tortured that—as he was being carried back to his cell—various pieces of charred bone fell from his feet to the floor. Prisoners could also be suspended head-downwards from stocks, with hot coals placed directly on the soles of the feet&amp;mdash;held in place by gravity&amp;mdash;while thin slivers of burning embers were slid between pairs of adjacent toes.

== Brittany ==
In [[Brittany]], an enhanced interrogation chair was used&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Abbott, ''Rack, Rope, and Red-Hot Pincers'', London: Trafalgar Square Publishing, 1993, pp. 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt; that immobilized the feet and provided a movable tray of coals that could be cranked up and down, eventually making physical contact with the soles of the feet.

== Star kicking ==
A form of torture called "star kicking" supposedly began with [[Countess Elizabeth Bathory]], who would place oiled bits of paper or string between the prisoner's toes and light the material on fire.&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly L. Craft, ''Infamous Lady: The True Story of Countess Erzsebet Bathory'', North Charleston, SC: CreateSpace Independent Publishing, 2002, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no agreed set of rights or a [[Software license|license]] or an [[EULA]] which would define "freeware" unambiguously; every freeware publisher defines their own rules for their freeware. For instance, [[Freely redistributable software|redistribution of freeware]] by third-parties is often permitted but there is a significant portion of freeware which prohibits redistribution. 

Freeware, although itself free of charge, may be intended to benefit its producer, e.g. by encouraging sales of a more capable version ("[[Freemium]]" or [[Shareware]] [[business model]]). The [[source code]] of freeware is typically not available, unlike [[free and open-source software]] which are also often distributed free of charge.&lt;ref name="linfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gnu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dod-definition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wolfire2010"/&gt;

==History==
The term ''freeware'' was coined in 1982&lt;ref&gt;"Shareware: An Alternative to the High Cost of Software", ''Damon Camille'', ''1987''&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Andrew Fluegelman]] when he wanted to sell a communications program named [[PC-Talk]] that he had created but for which he did not wish to use commercial distribution channels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://textfiles.fisher.hu/news/freeware.txt Fisher.hu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614133129/http://textfiles.fisher.hu/news/freeware.txt |date=2006-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluegelman actually distributed PC-Talk via a process now referred to as [[shareware]], no longer called freeware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc-shareware.com/quality.htm The Price of Quality Software] by Tom Smith&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''freeware'' was used often in the 1980s and 1990s for programs released without [[source code]].&lt;ref name="gnu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html |title=Categories of free and nonfree software |quote=The term “freeware” has no clear accepted definition, but it is commonly used for packages which permit redistribution but not modification (and their source code is not available). These packages are not free software, so please don't use “freeware” to refer to free software. |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fsf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/words-to-avoid.html#Freeware |title=Words to Avoid (or Use with Care) Because They Are Loaded or Confusing |author=Free Software Foundation, Inc. |quote=Please don't use the term “freeware” as a synonym for “free software.” The term “freeware” was used often in the 1980s for programs released only as executables, with source code not available. Today it has no particular agreed-on definition. |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to other forms of software licensing===
[[File:Open-source-vs-freeware.svg|thumb|This [[Venn diagram]] describes the typical relationship between freeware and [[open source software]]: According to David Rosen from [[Wolfire Games]] in 2010, open source software (orange) is most often gratis but not always. Freeware (green) seldom expose their source codes.&lt;ref name="wolfire2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/05/Open-source-software-is-not-always-freeware |title=Open-source software is not always freeware |date=May 16, 2010 |accessdate=2016-01-18 |first=David |last=Rosen |publisher=wolfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) defines "open source software" (i.e., free software or free and open-source software), as distinct from "freeware" or "shareware"; it is software where "the Government does not have access to the original source code".&lt;ref name="dod-definition"&gt;{{citation | url=http://dodcio.defense.gov/OpenSourceSoftwareFAQ.aspx#Q:_Are_.22non-commercial_software.22.2C_.22freeware.22.2C_or_.22shareware.22_the_same_thing_as_open_source_software.3F | title=Frequently Asked Questions regarding Open Source Software (OSS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) | quote=Also, do not use the terms "freeware" or "shareware" as a synonym for "open source software". DoD Instruction 8500.2, “Information Assurance (IA) Implementation”, Enclosure 4, control DCPD-1, states that these terms apply to software where "the Government does not have access to the original source code".  The government does have access to the original source code of open source software, so these terms do not apply. | accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "free" in "freeware" refers to the price of the software, which is typically [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and distributed without source code. By contrast, the "free" in "free software" refers to freedoms granted users under the software license (for example, to run the program for any purpose, modify and redistribute the program to others), and such software may be sold at a price.

According to the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF), "freeware" is a loosely defined category and it has no clear accepted definition, although FSF asks that [[free software]] (libre; unrestricted and with source code available) should not be called freeware.&lt;ref name="gnu" /&gt;
In contrast the Oxford English Dictionary simply characterizes freeware as being "available free of charge (sometimes with the suggestion that users should make a donation to the provider)".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|freeware}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some freeware products are released alongside paid versions that either have more features or less restrictive licensing terms. This approach is known as [[freemium]] ("free" + "premium"), since the free version is intended as a promotion for the premium version.&lt;ref name="freeisnot"/&gt; The two often share a code base, using a [[compiler flag]] to determine which is produced. For example, [[BBEdit]] has a [[BBEdit Lite]] edition which has fewer features. [[XnView]] is available free of charge for personal use but must be licensed for commercial use. The free version may be advertising supported, as was the case with the [[DivX]].

{{Anchor|Registerware}}[[Ad-supported software]] and free registerware also bear resemblances to freeware. Ad-supported software does not ask for payment for a license, but displays advertising to either compensate for development costs or as a means of income. Registerware forces the user to subscribe with the publisher before being able to use the product. While commercial products [[Product activation|may require registration to ensure licensed use]], free registerware do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=akoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA101&amp;lpg=RA1-PA101&amp;dq=registerware&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P8ufFsLfVk&amp;sig=zsK5DDTrgUSvTEdOSo9y6qhHFw4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgKahUKEwifvI6d7_DIAhXHthoKHXoFAFk#v=onepage&amp;q=registerware&amp;f=false|title = An exercise in frustration?

== Restrictions ==
Freeware cannot economically rely on commercial promotion. In May 2015 advertising freeware on [[Google AdWords]] was restricted to "authoritative source"[s].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6023676#uc |title=Legal requirements |website=Advertising Policies Help |publisher=[[Google]] |access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus web sites and [[blog]]s are the primary resource for information on which freeware is available, useful, and is not [[malware]]. However, there are also many [[computer magazine]]s or newspapers that provide ratings for freeware and include compact discs or other [[storage media]] containing freeware. Freeware is also often [[bundled software|bundled]] with other products such as [[digital camera]]s or [[Image scanner|scanner]]s.

Freeware has been criticized as "unsustainable" because it requires a single entity to be responsible for updating and enhancing the product, which is then given away without charge.&lt;ref name="freeisnot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/saas/free-is-not-a-business-model/807 |title=Free is not a business model |first=Phil |last=Wainewright |date=July 6, 2009 |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other freeware projects are simply released as [[one-off]] programs with no promise or expectation of further development. These may include [[source code]], as does free software, so that users can make any required or desired changes themselves, but this code remains subject to the license of the compiled executable and does not constitute free software.

The '''HDL Universal Tactical Role-Playing System''' is a [[role-playing game system]] produced by [[Tremorworks, LLC]].

== Details ==
HDL is a flexible, simple system of rules that are adaptable to a great number or settings, allowing them to be  used as alternate rules for existing games or as a mechanic for running campaigns of your own design. Unlike  other “universal” gaming systems, HDL’s focus is on simplicity and realism. To play, all you need is the main  book (a small and inexpensive volume as compared to many others), a set of HDL cards, and a few dice. There  is no need to purchase a slew of “required” supplemental information; everything you need is in one book.

Character creation is point-based; allocate 65 points to stats, ranging from 1 to 10, and 5 points to Backgrounds. Additional Background Points can be gained by taking Weaknesses. Skill Points are determined by  the top three mental stats: Reason, Knowledge, and Resolve. The final step is to draw a Background Card, to help fill in some aspect of the character’s background or past.

Game play is almost entirely skill-based, with a very detailed skill list across a number of categories, such as Combat, Computer, and Technical: Design.

Experience Points (EXP) are awarded to players each game session, through role-playing, overcoming challenges, and playing Game Cards. EXP is then spent to improve the character’s skills or stats, and can also be used to re-roll poor dice rolls.

The HDL namesake originates from the dice mechanic for the game, called the Half Die Level. For simplicity, all variables boil down to a simple number, which determines the die rolled. The number equals half the sides on the die. Thus, HDL 2 = 1d4, HDL 6 = 1d12, and HDL 10 = 2d10. In general, all rolls are based on an HDL equal to a certain stat, plus the character’s rating in the associated skill. For instance, attacking with a sword is based on gross motor coordination, or the Coordination stat, and the Sword: Slashing skill, so a character would roll the HDL of his Coordination, then add his Sword: Slashing skill.

With the emphasis on realism, and a greater focus on role-playing than dice-rolling and fighting, combat is intentionally quick and deadly; even the strongest enemy (or character) can still be felled by a well-placed
bullet or sword strike. Racking up a body count, or accumulating wealth, are secondary to the story and
characters. In this way, power-gamers quickly learn the benefits of negotiation and skill diversity, rather than the ability to smash down any obstacle or opponent. At the same time, the system is designed to help the players succeed; the Narrator is encouraged to challenge players, but in the end they are expected to survive and, ultimately, win.

ESPers are another focus of the main rules: people with incredible psychic powers. Built using a Background and special skills, ESPers have a wide range of paranormal abilities, including mind reading, telekinesis, and even teleportation. The ESPer rules can also be adapted for use as magical abilities in fantasy settings.

For war-game players, strategic hex-map based tactical combat is possible with the optional SCom rules. This optional addition to standard combat rules uses a point-based action system that is simple yet deeply strategic. With this system, direct competitive play is even possible.

[[File:GHS-pictogram-skull.svg|thumb|[[Skull and crossbones (poison)|Skull and crossbones]], a common symbol for poison and other sources of [[Death|lethal danger]] ([[GHS hazard pictograms]])]]

'''Hazard symbols''' or '''warning symbols''' are recognisable [[symbol]]s designed to warn about hazardous or dangerous materials, locations, or objects, including electric currents, poisons, and [[radioactivity]]. The use of hazard symbols is often regulated by law and directed by [[standards organisation]]s. Hazard symbols may appear with different colors, backgrounds, borders and supplemental information in order to specify the type of hazard and the level of threat (for example, [[toxicity class]]es).  Warning symbols are used in many places in lieu of or addition to written warnings as they are quickly recognized (faster than reading a written warning) and more commonly understood (the same symbol can be recognized as having the same meaning to speakers of different languages).

==Generic warning symbol==
{{further|Warning sign}}
[[Image:Achtung.svg|thumb|80px|alt=German road warning sign|German road warning symbol]]

On roadside [[warning sign]]s, an [[exclamation mark]] is often used to draw attention to a generic warning of danger, hazards, and the unexpected. In Europe, this type of sign is used if there are no more-specific signs to denote a particular hazard.&lt;ref name="A series european traffic signs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/traffic/signs/Aa.html|title=A series european traffic signs}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used for traffic signs, it is accompanied by a supplementary sign describing the hazard, usually mounted under the exclamation mark.

This symbol has also been more widely adopted for generic use in many other contexts not associated with road traffic. It often appears on hazardous equipment or in instruction manuals to draw attention to a precaution, when a more-specific warning symbol is not available.

==Poison symbol==
{{Main|Skull and crossbones (poison)}}
[[Image:Skull and crossbones.svg|thumb|80px|alt=Skull and crossbones|Skull and crossbones]]
The skull-and-crossbones symbol (☠), consisting of a [[human skull]] and two bones crossed together behind the skull, is today generally used as a warning of danger, particularly in regard to [[poison]]ous substances.

The symbol, or some variation thereof, specifically with the bones (or swords) below the skull, was also featured on the [[Jolly Roger]], the traditional [[flag]] of European and American seagoing [[pirate]]s. It is also part of the Canadian [[Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System|WHMIS]] home symbols placed on containers to warn that the contents are poisonous.

In the United States, due to concerns that the skull-and-crossbones symbol's association with pirates might encourage children to play with toxic materials, the [[Mr. Yuk]] symbol is also used to denote poison.

==Ionizing radiation symbol== 	 &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Trefoil]] --&gt;
{{anchor|ISO 21482|Radioactive sign}}
The '''international radiation symbol''' (also known as the [[trefoil]]) first appeared in 1946, at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|University of California, Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="Origin of the Radiation Warning Symbol (Trefoil)"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/radwarnsymbstory.htm|title=Origin of the Radiation Warning Symbol (Trefoil)}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was rendered as [[magenta]], and was set on a [[blue]] background. The original version used in America is magenta against a yellow background, and it is drawn with a central circle of radius ''R'', an internal radius of 1.5''R'' and an external radius of 5''R'' for the blades, which are separated from each other by 60°. The trefoil is black in the international version, which is also used in America.&lt;ref name="Biohazard and radioactive symbol, design and proportions"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_WSH_part476_54539_7.pdf |title=Biohazard and radioactive symbol, design and proportions |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231181252/http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_WSH_part476_54539_7.pdf |archivedate=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign is commonly referred to as a [[radioactivity]] warning sign, but it is actually a warning sign of [[ionizing radiation]]. Ionizing radiation is a much broader category than radioactivity alone, as many non-radioactive sources also emit potentially dangerous levels of ionizing radiation. This includes x-ray apparatus, radiotherapy linear accelerators, and particle accelerators. [[Non-ionizing radiation]] can also reach potentially dangerous levels, but this warning sign is different from the trefoil ionizing radiation warning symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carexcanada.ca/en/ionizing_radiation/#regulations_and_guidelines|title=Ionizing Radiation |publisher=CAREX Canada|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2007, two groups—the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO)—jointly announced the adoption of a new [[ionizing radiation]] warning symbol to supplement the traditional trefoil symbol. The new symbol, to be used on sealed radiation sources, is aimed at alerting anyone, anywhere to the danger of being close to a strong source of ionizing radiation.&lt;ref&gt;''This symbol is included in ISO 21482:2007. ISO International Standards are protected by copyright and may be purchased from ISO or its members (please visit www.iso.org for more information). ISO has not reviewed the accuracy or veracity of this information.'' {{Cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2007/radiationsymbol.html|title=New Symbol Launched to Warn Public About Radiation Dangers|accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts, on a red background, a black trefoil with waves of radiation streaming from it, along with a black [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]], and a running figure with an arrow pointing away from the scene. The radiating trefoil suggests the presence of radiation, while the red background and the skull and crossbones warn of the danger. The figure running away from the scene is meant to suggest taking action to avoid the labeled material. The new symbol is not intended to be generally visible, but rather to appear on internal components of devices that house radiation sources so that if anybody attempts to disassemble such devices they will see an explicit warning not to proceed any further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2007/radiationsymbol.html|title=New Symbol Launched to Warn Public About Radiation Dangers|work=IAEA|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Jun262007/snt200706259363.asp|title=Deccan Herald – Drop it|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210212755/http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Jun262007/snt200706259363.asp|archivedate=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|left|80px|alt=Biohazard symbol|Biohazard symbol used since 1966]]

The '''biohazard symbol''' is used in the labeling of biological materials that carry a significant health risk ([[Biological hazard|biohazards]]), including viral samples and used [[hypodermic needles]] (see [[sharps waste]]).&lt;ref name=BiohazardScience&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The biohazard symbol was developed by the [[Dow Chemical Company]] in 1966 for their containment products.&lt;ref name="waterloo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm|title=Biohazard Symbol History|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716160837/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charles Baldwin,&lt;ref name="waterloo"/&gt; an environmental-health engineer who contributed to its development: "We wanted something that was memorable but meaningless, so we could educate people as to what it means." In an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1967, the symbol was presented as the new standard for all biological hazards ("biohazards"). The article explained that over 40 symbols were drawn up by Dow artists, and all of the symbols investigated had to meet a number of criteria: "(i) striking in form in order to draw immediate attention; (ii) unique and unambiguous, in order not to be confused with symbols used for other purposes; (iii) quickly recognizable and easily recalled; (iv) easily stenciled; (v) symmetrical, in order to appear identical from all angles of approach; and (vi) acceptable to groups of varying ethnic backgrounds." The chosen scored the best on nationwide testing for memorability.&lt;ref name=BiohazardScience&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=CL|author2=Runkle, RS|title=Biohazards symbol: development of a biological hazards warning signal.|journal=Science|date=Oct 13, 1967|volume=158|issue=3798|pages=264–5|doi=10.1126/science.158.3798.264|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/1967-10-13-Science-paper-Biohazard-Symbol.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2011|pmid=6053882|bibcode=1967Sci...158..264B|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324190420/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/1967-10-13-Science-paper-Biohazard-Symbol.pdf|archivedate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
All parts of the biohazard sign can be drawn with a [[compass and straightedge]]. The basic outline of the symbol is a plain [[trefoil]], which is three circles overlapping each other equally like in a triple [[Venn diagram]] with the overlapping parts erased. The [[diameters|diameter]] of the overlapping part is equal to half the [[radii|radius]] of the three circles. Then three inner circles are drawn in with {{frac|2|3}} radius of the original circles so that it is [[tangent]] to the outside three overlapping circles. A tiny circle in center has a [[diameter]] {{frac|1|2}} of the radius of the three inner circles, and [[Arc (geometry)|arcs]] are erased at 90°, 210°, and 330°. The arcs of the inner circles and the tiny circle are connected by a line. Finally, the ring under is drawn from the distance to the [[perimeter]] of the [[equilateral triangle]] that forms between the centers of the three intersecting circles. An outer circle of the ring under is drawn and finally enclosed with the arcs from the center of the inner circles with a shorter radius from the inner circles.&lt;ref name="Biohazard and radioactive symbol, design and proportions"/&gt;

==Chemical symbols==
A '''chemical hazard symbol''' is a [[pictogram]] applied to containers of dangerous [[chemical compound]]s to indicate the specific hazard, and thus the required precautions. There are several systems of labels, depending on the purpose, such as on the container for end use, or on a vehicle during transportation. 

===GHS symbols and statements===
{{main|GHS hazard pictograms}}
The [[United Nations]] has designed [[GHS hazard pictograms]] and [[GHS hazard statements]] to [[Harmonization|internationally harmonize]] chemical hazard warnings. Several European countries have started to implement these new global standards, but older warning symbols are still used in many parts of the world.

===Europe===
{{main|European hazard symbols}}
European standards are set by:
* [[CLP Regulation|CLP regulation]] (2008) for chemical containers, following international GHS recommendations; see European [[GHS hazard statements|CLP/GHS hazard symbols]]
* [[European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road]] (ADR) for additional packaging for transportation. Vehicles carrying dangerous goods must be equipped with orange signs, where the upper code number identifies the type of hazard, and the lower code number identifies the specific substance. These symbols cannot be readily interpreted without the aid of a table to translate the numerical codes.

The US-based [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA) has a standard [[NFPA 704]] using a diamond with four colored sections each with a number indicating severity 0—4 (0 for no hazard, 4 indicates a severe hazard). The red section denotes flammability. The blue section denotes health risks. Yellow represents reactivity (tendency to explode). The white section denotes special hazard information. One example of a special hazard would be the capital letter W crossed out (pictured left), indicating it is water reactant.

==Non-standard symbols==
[[Image:High voltage warning sign Beromuenster.JPG|thumb|Sign on a fence around the [[Beromünster]] Reserve Broadcasting Tower in Switzerland, warning of high voltage and lethal danger]]
A large number of warning symbols with non-standard designs are in use around the world.

Some warning symbols have been redesigned to be more comprehensible to children, such as the [[Mr. Ouch]] (depicting an electricity danger as a snarling, spiky creature) and [[Mr. Yuk]] (a green frowny face sticking its tongue out, to represent poison) designs in the United States.

Design of robust and reliable networks and [[network service]]s relies on an understanding of the [[network traffic|traffic]] characteristics of the network. Throughout history, different models of network traffic have been developed and used for evaluating existing and proposed networks and services.

Demands on [[computer network]]s are not entirely predictable. Performance modeling is necessary for deciding the [[quality of service]] (QoS) level. Performance models in turn, require accurate [[traffic model]]s that have the ability to capture the statistical characteristics of the actual traffic on the network. Many traffic models have been developed based on traffic measurement data. If the underlying traffic models do not efficiently capture the characteristics of the actual traffic, the result may be the under-estimation or over-estimation of the performance of the network. This impairs the design of the network. Traffic models are hence, a core component of any performance evaluation of networks and they need to be very accurate.

“Teletraffic theory is the application of mathematics to the measurement, modeling, and control of traffic in [[telecommunications network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Mathematics Meets the Internet|publisher=AMS|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199808/paxson.pdf|author=Willinger and Paxson|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of traffic modeling is to find stochastic processes to represent the behavior of traffic. Working at the Copenhagen Telephone Company in the 1910s, [[A. K. Erlang]] famously characterized telephone traffic at the call level by certain probability distributions for arrivals of new calls and their holding times. Erlang applied the traffic models to estimate the telephone switch capacity needed to achieve a given call blocking probability. The Erlang blocking formulas had tremendous practical interest for public carriers because telephone facilities (switching and transmission) involved considerable investments. Over several decades, Erlang’s work stimulated the use of queuing theory, and applied probability in general, to engineer the public switched [[telephone network]]. Teletraffic theory for packet networks has seen considerable progress in recent decades.&lt;ref name=parkwill&gt;{{cite book | last1=Park | first1=Kihong | last2=Willinger|first2=Walter|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/047120644X.fmatter_indsub/pdf|title=Self-similar network traffic and performance evaluation | publisher=Wiley | publication-place=New York | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-471-31974-0 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adas&gt;{{cite journal | last=Adas | first=A. | title=Traffic models in broadband networks | journal=IEEE Communications Magazine | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=35 | issue=7 | year=1997 | issn=0163-6804 | doi=10.1109/35.601746 | pages=82–89 | ref=harv}}

==Network traffic models usage==
Measurements are useful and necessary for verifying the actual [[network performance]]. However, measurements do not have the level of abstraction that makes traffic models useful. Traffic models can be used for hypothetical problem solving whereas traffic measurements only reflect current reality. In probabilistic terms, a traffic trace is a realization of a [[random process]], whereas a traffic model is a random process. Thus, traffic models have universality. A traffic trace gives insight about a particular traffic source, but a traffic model gives insight about all traffic sources of that type. Traffic models have three major uses. One important use of traffic models is to properly dimension network resources for a target level of [[Quality of service|QoS]]. It was mentioned earlier that Erlang developed models of [[voice call]]s to estimate telephone switch capacity to achieve a target call blocking probability. Similarly, models of packet traffic are needed to estimate the bandwidth and buffer resources to provide acceptable packet delays and [[packet loss]] probability. Knowledge of the average traffic rate is not sufficient. It is known from [[queuing theory]] that queue lengths increase with the variability of traffic.&lt;ref name="Kleinrock1975"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kleinrock | first=Leonard | title=Queueing systems | publisher=Wiley | publication-place=New York | year=1975 | isbn=978-0-471-49110-1 | language=de | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, an understanding of traffic burstiness or variability is needed to determine sufficient buffer sizes at nodes and link capacities.&lt;ref name="Barakat Thiran Iannaccone Diot 2003 pp. 2111–2124"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barakat | first=C. | last2=Thiran | first2=P. | last3=Iannaccone | first3=G. | last4=Diot | first4=C. | last5=Owezarski | first5=P. | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.2.8066&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Modeling internet backbone traffic at the flow level | journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=51 | issue=8 | year=2003 | issn=1053-587X | doi=10.1109/tsp.2003.814521 | pages=2111–2124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second important use of traffic models is to verify network performance under specific traffic controls. For example, given a packet scheduling algorithm, it would be possible to evaluate the network performance resulting from different traffic scenarios. For another example, a popular area of research is new improvements to the TCP congestion avoidance algorithm. It is critical that any algorithm is stable and allows multiple hosts to share bandwidth fairly, while sustaining a high throughput. Effective evaluation of the stability, fairness, and throughput of new algorithms would not be possible without realistic source models. A third important use of traffic models is admission control. In particular, connection oriented networks such as ATM depends on admission control to block new connections to maintain QOS guarantees. A simple admission strategy could be based on the peak rate of a new connection; a new connection is admitted if the available bandwidth is greater than the peak rate. However, that strategy would be overly conservative because a variable bit-rate connection may need significantly less bandwidth than its peak rate. A more sophisticated admission strategy is based on effective bandwidths.&lt;ref name="Statistical Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web | title=Notes on effective bandwidths | website=Statistical Laboratory | url=http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~frank/eb.html | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source traffic behavior is translated into an effective bandwidth between the peak rate and average rate, which is the specific amount of bandwidth required to meet a given QoS constraint. The effective bandwidth depends on the variability of the source.&lt;ref name=chen2007/&gt;

==Network traffic models steps==
Traffic modeling consists of three steps:
* (i) selection of one or more models that may provide a good description of the traffic type
* (ii) estimation of parameters for the selected models
* (iii) statistical testing for election of one of the considered models and analysis of its suitability to describe the traffic type under analysis.
Parameter estimation is based on a set of statistics (e.g. mean, variance, density function or auto covariance function, multifractal characteristics) that are measured or calculated from observed data. The set of statistics used in the inference process depends on the impact they may have in the main performance metrics of interest.&lt;ref name=nogueira&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nogueira | first=António | last2=Salvador | first2=Paulo | last3=Valadas | first3=Rui | last4=Pacheco | first4=António | journal=Telecommunication Systems | title=Modeling Network Traffic with Multifractal Behavior|publisher=Springer Nature | volume=24 | issue=2/4 | year=2003 | issn=1018-4864 | doi=10.1023/a:1026183318200 | pages=339–362 | ref=harv|url=
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7c27/a4732bc89057878b7bbf0db8772d2b13d6bd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network traffic models parameter==
In recent years several types of traffic behavior, that can have significant impact on network performance, were discovered: long-range dependence, [[self-similarity]] and, more recently, multifractality.
There are two major parameters generated by network traffic models: packet length distributions and packet inter-arrival distributions. Other parameters, such as routes, distribution of destinations, etc., are of less importance. Simulations that use traces generated by network traffic models usually examine a single node in the network, such as a router or switch; factors that depend on specific network topologies or routing information are specific to those topologies and simulations.&lt;ref name=arrowsmith&gt;{{cite web|author=D.K. Arrowsmith, R.J. Mondragon|title=Modelling Network Data Traffic|location=Queen Mary, University of London|url=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~arrow/BrisComp06.pdf|year=2006| access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of packet size distribution is fairly well-understood today. Existing models of packet sizes have proven to be valid and simple. Most packet size models do not consider the problem of order in packet sizes. For example, a TCP datagram in one direction is likely to be followed by a tiny ACK in the other direction about half of one Round-Trip Time (RTT) later. The problem of packet inter-arrival distribution is much more difficult. Understanding of network traffic has evolved significantly over the years, leading to a series of evolutions in network traffic models.

==Self-similar traffic models==
One of the earliest objections to self-similar traffic models was the difficulty in mathematical analysis. Existing self-similar models could not be used in conventional queuing models. This limitation was rapidly overturned and workable models were constructed. Once basic self-similar models became feasible, the traffic modeling community settled into the “detail” concerns. TCP’s congestion control algorithm complicated the matter of modeling traffic, so solutions needed to be created. Parameter estimation of self-similar models was always difficult, and recent research addresses ways to model network traffic without fully understanding it.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
[[File:Let us start from scratch.jpg|thumb|100px|Ilkka Norros]]
* [[Fractional Brownian motion]]:
When self-similar traffic models were first introduced, there were no efficient, analytically tractable processes to generate the models. [[Ilkka Norros]] devised a stochastic process for a storage model with self-similar input and constant bit-rate output. While this initial model was continuous rather than discrete, the model was effective, simple, and attractive.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
* SWING:
All self-similar traffic models suffer from one significant drawback: estimating the self-similarity parameters from real network traffic requires huge amounts of data and takes extended computation. The most modern method, wavelet multi-resolution analysis, is more efficient, but still very costly. This is undesirable in a traffic model. SWING uses a surprisingly simple model for the network traffic analysis and generation. The model examines characteristics of users, Request-Response Exchanges (RREs), connections, individual packets, and the overall network. No attempt is made to analyze self-similarity characteristics; any self-similarity in the generated traffic comes naturally from the aggregation of many ON/OFF sources.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wilson | first=Michael L. | title=A Historical View of Network Traffic Models | website=wustl.edu |year=2006| url=https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-06/ftp/traffic_models2/ | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pareto distribution]] process:
The Pareto distribution process produces independent and identically distributed (IID) inter-arrival times. In general if X is a random variable with a Pareto distribution, then the probability that X is greater than some number x is given by P(X &gt; x) = (x/x_m)-k for all x ≥ x_m where k is a positive parameter and x_m is the minimum possible value of Xi The probability distribution and the density functions are represented as:
F(t) = 1 – (α/t)β where α,β ≥ 0 &amp; t ≥ α
f(t) = βαβ t-β-1
The parameters β and α are the shape and location parameters, respectively. The Pareto distribution is applied to model self-similar arrival in packet traffic. It is also referred to as double exponential, power law distribution. Other important characteristics of the model are that the Pareto distribution has infinite variance, when β ≥ 2 and achieves infinite mean, when β ≤ 1.
* [[Weibull distribution]] process:
The Weibull distributed process is heavy-tailed and can model the fixed rate in ON period and ON/OFF period lengths, when producing self-similar traffic by multiplexing ON/OFF sources. The distribution function in this case is given by:
F(t) = 1 – e-(t/β)α t &gt; 0
and the density function of the weibull distribution is given as:
f(t) = αβ-α tα-1 e -(t/β)α t &gt; 0
where parameters β ≥ 0 and α &gt; 0 are the scale and location parameters respectively.
The Weibull distribution is close to a normal distribution. For β ≤ 1 the density function of the distribution is L shaped and for values of β &gt; 1, it is bell shaped. This distribution gives a failure rate increasing with time. For β &gt; 1, the failure rate decreases with time. At, β = 1, the failure rate is constant and the lifetimes are exponentially distributed.
* [[Autoregressive model]]s:
The Autoregressive model is one of a group of linear prediction formulas that attempt to predict an output y_n of a system based on previous set of outputs {y_k} where k &lt; n and inputs x_n and {x_k} where k &lt; n. There exist minor changes in the way the predictions are computed based on which, several variations of the model are developed. Basically, when the model depends only on the previous outputs of the system, it is referred to as an auto-regressive model. It is referred to as a Moving Average Model (MAM), if it depends on only the inputs to the system. Finally, Autoregressive-Moving Average models are those that depend both on the inputs and the outputs, for prediction of current output. Autoregressive model of order p, denoted as AR(p), has the following form:
Xt = R1 Xt-1 + R2 Xt-2 + ... + Rp Xt-p + Wt
where Wt is the white noise, Ri are real numbers and Xt are prescribed correlated random numbers. The auto-correlation function of the AR(p) process consists of damped sine waves depending on whether the roots (solutions) of the model are real or imaginary. Discrete Autoregressive Model of order p, denoted as DAR(p), generates a stationary sequence of discrete random variables with a probability distribution and with an auto-correlation structure similar to that of the Autoregressive model of order p.[3]
* [[Regression model]]s:
Regression models define explicitly the next random variable in the sequence by previous ones within a specified time window and a moving average of a white noise.[5]
* [[TES model]]s :
Transform-expand-sample (TES) models are non-linear regression models with modulo-1 arithmetic. They aim to capture both auto-correlation and marginal distribution of empirical data. TES models consist of two major TES processes: TES+ and TES–. TES+ produces a sequence which has positive correlation at lag 1, while TES– produces a negative correlation at lag 1.&lt;ref name="Jelenkovic1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jelenkovic | first=P.R. | last2=Melamed | first2=B. | title=Algorithmic modeling of TES processes | journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=40 | issue=7 | year=1995 | issn=0018-9286 | doi=10.1109/9.400470 | pages=1305–1312|url=http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~predrag/mypub/TES95.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-self-similar traffic models==
Early traffic models were derived from telecommunications models and focused on simplicity of analysis. They generally operated under the assumption that aggregating traffic from a large number of sources tended to smooth out bursts; that burstiness decreased as the number of traffic sources increased.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
* [[Poisson distribution]] model:
One of the most widely used and oldest traffic models is the Poisson Model. The memoryless Poisson distribution is the predominant model used for analyzing traffic in traditional telephony networks. The Poisson process is characterized as a renewal process. In a Poisson process the inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed with a rate parameter λ: P{An ≤ t} = 1 – exp(-λt). The Poisson distribution is appropriate if the arrivals are from a large number of independent sources, referred to as Poisson sources. The distribution has a mean and variance equal to the parameter λ.
The Poisson distribution can be visualized as a limiting form of the binomial distribution, and is also used widely in queuing models. There are a number of interesting mathematical properties exhibited by Poisson processes. Primarily, superposition of independent Poisson processes results in a new Poisson process whose rate is the sum of the rates of the independent Poisson processes. Further, the independent increment property renders a Poisson process memoryless. Poisson processes are common in traffic applications scenarios that consist of a large number of independent traffic streams. The reason behind the usage stems from Palm's Theorem which states that under suitable conditions, such large number of independent multiplexed streams approach a Poisson process as the number of processes grows, but the individual rates decrease in order to keep the aggregate rate constant. Nevertheless, it is to be noted that traffic aggregation need not always result in a Poisson process. The two primary assumptions that the Poisson model makes are:&lt;ref name=chandra&gt;{{cite web | last=Chandrasekaran | first=Balakrishnan | title=Survey of Network Traffic Models | website=Washington University in St. Louis - Computer Science &amp; Engineering at WashU | date=2006-11-27 | url=http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-06/ftp/traffic_models3/index.html | ref=harv | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1. The number of sources is infinite
2. The traffic arrival pattern is random.
* [[Compound Poisson process|Compound Poisson traffic models]]:
In the compound Poisson model, the base Poisson model is extended to deliver batches of packets at once. The inter-batch arrival times are exponentially distributed, while the batch size is geometric Mathematically, this model has two parameters, λ, the arrival rate, and ρ in (0,1), the batch parameter. Thus, the mean number of packets in a batch is 1/ ρ, while the mean inter-batch arrival time is 1/ λ. Mean packet arrivals over time period t are tλ/ ρ.
The compound Poisson model shares some of the analytical benefits of the pure Poisson model: the model is still memoryless, aggregation of streams is still (compound) Poisson, and the steady-state equation is still reasonably simple to calculate, although varying batch parameters for differing flows would complicate the derivation.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
* [[Markov model|Markov]] and Embedded Markov Models:
Markov models attempt to model the activities of a traffic source on a network, by a finite number of states. The accuracy of the model increases linearly with the number of states used in the model. However, the complexity of the model also increases proportionally with increasing number of states. An important aspect of the Markov model - the Markov Property, states that the next (future) state depends only on the current state. In other words, the probability of the next state, denoted by some random variable Xn+1, depends only on the current state, indicated by Xn, and not on any other state Xi, where i&lt;n. The set of random variables referring to different states {Xn} is referred to as a Discrete Markov Chain.
* [[Packet train]]s:
Another attempt at providing a bursty traffic model is found in Jain and Routhier’s Packet Trains model.&lt;ref name="Jain Routhier 1986 pp. 986–995"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jain | first=R. | last2=Routhier | first2=S. | title=Packet Trains--Measurements and a New Model for Computer Network Traffic | journal=IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=4 | issue=6 | year=1986 | issn=0733-8716 | doi=10.1109/jsac.1986.1146410 | pages=986–995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was principally designed to recognize that address locality applies to routing decisions; that is, packets that arrive near each other in time are frequently going to the same destination. In generating a traffic model that allows for easier analysis of locality, the authors created the notion of packet trains, a sequence of packets from the same source, traveling to the same destination (with replies in the opposite direction). Packet trains are optionally sub-divided into tandem trailers. Traffic between a source and a destination usually consists of a series of messages back and forth. Thus, a series of packets go one direction, followed by one or more reply packets, followed by a new series in the initial direction. Traffic quantity is then a superposition of packet trains, which generates substantial bursty behavior. This refines the general conception of the compound Poisson model, which recognized that packets arrived in groups, by analyzing why they arrive in groups, and better characterizing the attributes of the group. Finally, the authors demonstrate that packet arrival times are not Poisson distributed, which led to a model that departs from variations on the Poisson theme. The packet train model is characterized by the following parameters and their associated probability distributions:
*mean inter-train arrival time
*mean inter-car arrival time
*mean truck size (in the tandem trailer model)
*mean train size.
The train model is designed for analyzing and categorizing real traffic, not for generating synthetic loads for simulation. Thus, little claim has been made about the feasibility of packet trains for generating synthetic traffic. Given accurate parameters and distributions, generation should be straightforward, but derivation of these parameters is not addressed.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;

==Traffic models today==
[[NS-2]] is a popular network simulator;&lt;ref name="ns and nam Sourceforge home 2010"&gt;{{cite web | title=nsnam | website=ns and nam Sourceforge home | date=2010-04-05 | url=http://nsnam.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; PackMimeHTTP is a web traffic generator for NS-2, published in 2004. It does take long-range dependencies into account, and uses the [[Weibull distribution]]. Thus, it relies on [[Long tail|heavy tails]] to emulate true [[self-similarity]]. Over most time scales, the effort is a success; only a long-running simulation would allow a distinction to be drawn. This follows suggestions from where it is suggested that self-similar processes can be represented as a superposition of many sources each individually modeled with a heavy-tailed distribution. It is clear that self-similar traffic models are in the mainstream.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;

In [[space exploration]], '''in situ resource utilization''' ('''ISRU''') is defined as ''"the collection, processing, storing and use of materials encountered in the course of human or robotic space exploration that replace materials that would otherwise be brought from Earth."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sacksteder|first1=Kurt R.|last2=Sanders|first2=Gerald B.|title=In-situ resource utilization for lunar and mars exploration|journal=AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit|date=January 2007|volume=AIAA 2007-345|doi=10.2514/6.2007-345|url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2007-345|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ISRU is the practice of leveraging resources found or manufactured on other [[astronomical object]]s (the Moon, Mars, asteroids, etc.) to fulfill or enhance the requirements and capabilities of a [[space mission]].

ISRU can provide materials for [[life support system|life support]], [[propellant]]s, [[construction material]]s, and energy to a spacecraft [[payload]]s or space exploration crews.
It is now very common for [[spacecraft]] and robotic planetary surface mission to harness the [[solar radiation]] found ''[[in situ]]'' in the form of [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]]. The use of ISRU for material production has not yet been implemented in a space mission, though several field tests in the late 2000s demonstrated various lunar ISRU techniques in a relevant environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Integration of In-Situ Resource Utilization into lunar/Mars exploration through field analogs|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117710005788|journal = Advances in Space Research|date = 2011-01-04|pages = 20–29|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.asr.2010.08.020|first = Gerald B.|last = Sanders|first2 = William E.|last2 = Larson|bibcode = 2011AdSpR..47...20S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISRU has long been considered as a possible avenue for reducing the mass and cost of space exploration architectures, in that it may be a way to drastically reduce the amount of payload that must be launched from Earth in order to explore a given [[planetary body]].
According to [[NASA]], "in-situ resource utilisation will enable the affordable establishment of [[extraterrestrial exploration]] and operations by minimizing the materials carried from Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Uses==

=== Water ===
In the context of ISRU water is most often sought directly as fuel or as feedstock for fuel production. Applications include its use in life support either directly by drinking, for [[Space farming|growing food]], [[Electrolysis of water|producing oxygen]], or numerous other industrial processes. All of which require a ready supply of water in the environment and the equipment to extract it. Such [[extraterrestrial water]] has been discovered in a variety of forms throughout the solar system, and a number of potential water extraction technologies have been investigated. For water that is chemically bound to [[regolith]], solid ice, or some manner of permafrost, sufficient heating can recover the water. However this is not as easy as it appears because ice and permafrost can often be harder than plain rock, necessitating laborious mining operations. Where there is some level of atmosphere, such as on Mars, water can be extracted directly from the air using a simple process such as [[WAVAR]]. Another possible source of water is deep aquifers kept warm by Mars's latent geological heat, which can be tapped to provide both water and geothermal power.

=== Rocket propellant ===
Rocket propellant from [[water]] [[ice]] has also been proposed for the [[Moon]], mainly from [[lunar ice|ice that has been found at the poles]]. The likely difficulties include working at extremely low temperatures and extraction from the [[regolith]]. Most schemes [[Electrolysis of water|electrolyse the water]] and form [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] and liquify and [[cryogenic]]ally store them. This requires large amounts of equipment and power to achieve. Alternatively it is possible to simply heat the water in a nuclear or solar [[thermal rocket]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neofuel.com/space98/ LSP water truck]. Neofuel.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to give very much more [[mass]] delivered to [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) in spite of the much lower [[specific impulse]], for a given amount of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neofuel.com/moonice1000/ steam rocket factor 1000]. Neofuel.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[monopropellant]] [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be made from water on [[Mars]] and the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph21/Chapter%206.pdf|title=Chapter 6: Viking and the Resources of Mars (from a history of NASA)|publisher=NASA|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-08-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aluminum]] as well as other metals have been proposed for use as rocket propellant made using lunar resources,&lt;ref name="Hepp" /&gt; and proposals include reacting the aluminum with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/24/nasa_alice_test/|title=New NASA rocket fuel 'could be made on Moon, Mars'|last=Page|first=Lewis|date=August 24, 2009|work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Mars, methane propellant can be manufactured via the [[Sabatier reaction|Sabatier]] process.

===Solar cell production===
It has long been suggested that [[solar cell]]s could be produced from the materials present in lunar soil. Silicon, aluminium, and glass, three of the primary materials required for solar cell production, are found in high concentrations in lunar soil and can be utilised to produce solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Materials refining on the Moon|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576506004085|journal = Acta Astronautica|date = 2007-05-01|pages = 906–915|volume = 60|issue = 10–11|doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.11.004|first = Geoffrey A.|last = Landis|bibcode = 2007AcAau..60..906L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the native vacuum on the lunar surface provides an excellent environment for direct vacuum deposition of thin-film materials for solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070018263.pdf|title = Process Demonstration For Lunar In Situ Resource Utilization—Molten Oxide Electrolysis|last = Curreri|first = Peter|date = 2006|journal = MSFC Independent Research and Development Project (No. 5–81), 2.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-09-27|last2 = Ethridge|first2 = E.C.|last3 = Hudson|first3 = S.B.|last4 = Miller|first4 = T.Y.|last5 = Grugel|first5 = R.N.|last6 = Sen|first6 = S.|last7 = Sadoway|first7 = Donald R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar arrays produced on the lunar surface can be used to support lunar surface operations as well as satellites off the lunar surface. Solar arrays produced on the lunar surface may prove more cost effective than solar arrays produced and shipped from Earth, but this trade depends heavily on the location of the particular application in question.

Another potential application of lunar-derived solar arrays is providing power to Earth. In its original form, known as the [[solar power satellite]], the proposal was intended as an alternate power source for [[Earth]]. Solar cells would be shipped to Earth orbit and assembled, the power being transmitted to Earth via microwave beams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite much work on the cost of such a venture, the uncertainty lay in the cost and complexity of fabrication procedures on the lunar surface.

===Metals for construction or return to Earth===
[[Asteroid mining]] could also involve extraction of metals for construction material in space, which may be more cost-effective than bringing such material up out of [[Earth]]'s deep gravity well, or that of any other large body like the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]].  Metallic asteroids contain huge amounts of [[siderophile element|siderophilic metals]], including [[precious metal]]s.

===Building materials===
The colonisation of planets or moons will require obtaining local building materials, such as [[regolith]]. For example, studies employing artificial Mars soil mixed with [[epoxy resin]] and [[tetraethoxysilane]], produce high enough values of strength, resistance, and flexibility parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Polymeric composites on the basis of Martian ground for building future mars stations |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |date=April 2016 |last=Mukbaniani |first=O.

===Mars===
{{See also|Mars Direct}}
ISRU research for Mars is focused primarily on providing [[rocket propellant]] for a return trip to Earth&amp;nbsp;— either for a manned or a sample return mission&amp;nbsp;— or for use as fuel on Mars. Many of the proposed techniques utilise the well-characterised [[atmosphere of Mars]] as feedstock.  Since this can be easily simulated on Earth, these proposals are relatively simple to implement, though it is by no means certain that NASA or the ESA will favour this approach over a more conventional direct mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars Sample Return|url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Aurora/SEM1PM808BE_0.html|publisher=www.esa.int|accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical proposal for ISRU is the use of a [[Sabatier reaction]], {{nowrap|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}, in order to produce methane on the Martian surface, to be used as a propellant.  Oxygen is liberated from the water by [[Electrolysis of water|electrolysis]], and the hydrogen recycled back into the Sabatier reaction.  The usefulness of this reaction is that—{{asof|2008|lc=on}}, when the availability of water on Mars was less scientifically demonstrated—only the hydrogen (which is light) was thought to need to be brought from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sizing of a Combined Sabatier Reaction and Water Electrolysis Plant for Use in In Situ Resource Utilization on Mars|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/jur/200109/papers/paper_canton.html|publisher=www.clas.ufl.edu|accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2016}}, [[SpaceX]] is currently [[New product development|developing]]&lt;!-- development starts with design, as long as the project is funded; the SpaceX ITS system is a funded development project --&gt; the technology for a [[SpaceX Mars propellant plant|Mars propellant plant]] that will use a variation on what is described in the previous paragraph.  Rather than transporting hydrogen from Earth to use in making the methane and oxygen, they intend to mine the requisite water from subsurface [[ice|water ice]] that is now known to be abundant across much of the Martian surface, produce and then [[Liquefied natural gas|store]] the post-Sabatier reactants, and then use it as propellant for return flights of their ''[[Interplanetary Spaceship]]'' no earlier than 2023.&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609&gt;

A similar reaction proposed for Mars is the reverse [[water gas shift reaction]],  {{nowrap|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}. This reaction takes place rapidly in the presence of an iron-chrome [[catalyst]] at 400 Celsius,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Again, oxygen is recycled from the water by [[Electrolysis of water|electrolysis]], and the reaction only needs a small amount of hydrogen from Earth.  The net result of this reaction is the production of oxygen, to be used as the oxidizer component of rocket fuel.

Another reaction proposed for the production of oxygen and fuel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2514/2.3739|title=Mars Rocket Vehicle Using In Situ Propellants|first1=Geoffrey A.|last1=Landis|first2=Diane L.|last2=Linne|date=1 January 2001|publisher=|volume=38|issue=5|pages=730–735|accessdate=1 December 2016|via=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|doi=10.2514/2.3739|bibcode=2001JSpRo..38..730L}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the electrolysis of the atmospheric carbon dioxide,

More recently, it has been proposed the in situ production of oxygen, hydrogen and CO  from the  martian hematite deposits via a two-step thermochemical {{CO2|link=yes}}/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O splitting process, and specifically in the magnetite/wustite redox cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco J. Arias. 2016.  On the in situ production of oxygen and hydrogen from martian hematite deposits via a two-step thermochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O splitting process. Journal of Space Colonization. Issue 5. ISSN 2053-1737&lt;/ref&gt;  Although thermolysis is the most direct, one-step process for splitting molecules, it is neither practical nor efficient in the case of either H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is because the process requires a very high temperature (&gt; 2500 C) to achieve a meaningful dissociation fraction.&lt;ref&gt;Ermanoski, I., Siegel, N. P., and Stechel, E. B., A New Reactor Concept for Efficient Solar-Thermochemical Fuel Production," Journal of Solar Energy Engineering, Vol. 135, No. 3, 2013, Paper 031002&lt;/ref&gt; This poses problems in finding suitable reactor materials, losses due to vigorous product recombination, and excessive aperture radiation losses when concentrated solar heat is used. The magnetite/wustite redox cycle was first proposed for solar application on earth by Nakamura,&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, T., \Hydrogen Production from Water Utilizing Solar Heat at High Temperatures, Solar Energy, Vol. 19, No. 5, 1977, pp. 467{475.&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the first used for solar-driven two-step water splitting. In this cycle, water reacts with wustite (FeO) to form magnetite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydrogen. The summarised reactions in this two-step splitting process are as follows:

: &lt;chem&gt;Fe3O4 -&gt;[energy] {3FeO} + \overbrace{1/2O2}^{\underset{(\operatorname{by-product})}{oxygen}}&lt;/chem&gt;.

and the obtained FeO is used for  the thermal splitting of water or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; :

: {{nowrap|3FeO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
: {{nowrap|3FeO + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + CO}}

This process is repeated cyclically. The above process results in a substantial reduction in the thermal input of energy if compared with the most direct, one-step process for splitting molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Roeb, M., Neises, M., Monnerie, N., Call, F., Simon, H., Sattler, C., Schmucker, M., and Pitz-Paal, R.,  Materials-Related Aspects of Thermochemical Water and Carbon Dioxide Splitting: A Review," Materials, Vol. 5, 2012, pp. 2015 2054.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the process needs wustite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to start the cycle, but on Mars there is no wustite or at least not in significant amounts. Nevertheless,  wustite can be  easily obtained by reduction of hematite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)  which is an abundant material on Mars, being specially conspicuous the  strong hematite  deposits located at Terra Meridiani.&lt;ref&gt;William K. Hartmann. 2003. A Traveler's Guide to Mars: The Mysterious Landscapes of the Red Planet. Workman Pub., 2003-Science&lt;/ref&gt;
The intention of wustite from the hematite -abundantly available on Mars, is an industrial  process well-known on earth, and us performed   by the following two main reduction reactions, namely:   
  
: {{nowrap|3Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}
: {{nowrap|3Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO → 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

===Moon===
[[Image:Footprint.gif|thumb|left|250px|Footprint in lunar [[regolith]].]]

&lt;/ref&gt;  Oxygen is often found in iron rich lunar minerals and glasses as [[iron oxide]]. The oxygen can be extracted by heating the material to temperatures above 900&amp;nbsp;°C and exposing it to hydrogen gas. The basic equation is: FeO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

===Martian moons, Ceres, asteroids===
Other proposals&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Zuppero and Geoffrey A. Landis, "Mass budget for mining the moons of Mars," ''Resources of Near-Earth Space,'' University of Arizona, 1991 (abstract here [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=49095&amp;id=2&amp;as=false&amp;or=false&amp;qs=Ntt%3Dzuppero%26Ntk%3Dall%26Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall%26Ns%3DArchiveName%257c1%26N%3D4294808501] or here [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991rnes.nasa...24Z])&lt;/ref&gt; are based on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. These moons are in reasonably high orbits above Mars, have very low escape velocities, and unlike Mars have return [[delta-v budget|delta-v]]'s from their surfaces to [[Low Earth Orbit|LEO]] which are less than the return from the Moon.

[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is further out than Mars, with a higher delta-v, but launch windows and travel times are better, and the surface gravity is just 0.028 g, with a very low escape velocity of 510&amp;nbsp;m/s. Researchers have speculated that the interior configuration of Ceres includes a water-ice-rich mantle over a rocky core.&lt;ref name="Thomas2005"&gt;

Proposals have been made for "mining" for [[rocket propulsion]], using what is called a [[Propulsive Fluid Accumulator]].

&lt;/ref&gt;
The report identifies seven ISRU capabilities:&lt;ref name=NCRES2005/&gt;{{rp|278}}
(i) resource extraction, (ii) material handling and transport, (iii) resource processing, (iv) surface manufacturing with ''in situ'' resources, (v) surface construction, (vi) surface ISRU product and consumable storage and distribution, and (vii) ISRU unique development and certification capabilities. 

The report focuses on lunar and martian environments. It offers a detailed timeline&lt;ref name=NCRES2005/&gt;{{rp|274}} and capability roadmap to 2040&lt;ref name=NCRES2005/&gt;{{rp|280-281}} but it assumes lunar landers in 2010 and 2012.&lt;ref name=NCRES2005/&gt;{{rp|280}}

==ISRU technology demonstrators and prototypes==
The [[Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander]] was intended to carry to Mars a test payload, MIP (Mars ISPP Precursor), that was to demonstrate manufacture of [[oxygen]] from the atmosphere of Mars,&lt;ref name=Kaplan2001&gt;D.

The [[Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment]] (MOXIE) is a 1% scale prototype model aboard the planned [[Mars 2020]] rover that will produce [[oxygen]] from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide ([[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) in a process called [[Solid oxide electrolyser cell|solid oxide electrolysis]].&lt;ref name=techport&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA TechPort -- Mars OXygen ISRU Experiment Project|url=https://techport.nasa.gov/view/33080|website=NASA TechPort|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wall 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wall |first=Mike |url=http://www.space.com/26705-nasa-2020-rover-mars-colony-tech.html |title=Oxygen-Generating Mars Rover to Bring Colonization Closer |work=Space.com |date=August 1, 2014 |accessdate=2014-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GFSC&gt;[https://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/IPM/Final/PDF/ThursPM.pdf The Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE)] PDF.

'''Inattentional blindness''', also known as '''perceptual blindness''', is a psychological lack of attention that is not associated with any vision defects or deficits. It may be further defined as the event in which an individual fails to perceive an unexpected stimulus that is in plain sight. When it simply becomes impossible for one to attend to all the stimuli in a given situation, a temporary '''blindness effect''' can take place as a result; that is, individuals fail to see objects or stimuli that are unexpected and quite often salient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The term was coined by Arien Mack and [[Irvin Rock]] in 1992 and was used as the title of their book of the same name, published by [[MIT Press|MIT press]] in 1998,&lt;ref name="Mack1998"/&gt; in which they describe the discovery of the phenomenon and include a collection of procedures used in describing it.&lt;ref name="Rock, 1992"/&gt; A famous study that demonstrated inattentional blindness asked participants whether or not they noticed a gorilla walking through the scene of a visual task they had been given.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simons |first1=Daniel J. |last2=Chabris |first2=Christopher F. |title=Gorillas in our midst: sustained inattentional blindness for dynamic events |journal=Perception |year=1999 |volume=28 |pages=1059–1074 |url=http://www.chabris.com/Simons1999.pdf |doi=10.1068/p2952 |pmid=10694957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on inattentional blindness suggests that the phenomenon can occur in any individual, independent of [[Cognition|cognitive]] deficits. However, recent evidence shows that patients with ADHD performed better attentionally when engaging in inattentional blindness tasks than control patients did,&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grossman |first1=Ephraim S. |last2=Hoffman |first2=Yaakov S.

==Defining criteria==
The following criteria are required to classify an event as an inattentional blindness episode: 1) the observer must fail to notice a visual object or event, 2) the object or event must be fully visible, 3) observers must be able to readily identify the object if they are consciously perceiving it,&lt;ref name="Rock, 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rock | first1 = I. | last2 = Linnet | first2 = C. M. | last3 = Grant | first3 = P. I. | last4 = Mack | first4 = A. | year = 1992 | title = Perception without Attention: Results of a new method | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 502–534 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(92)90017-v| pmid = 1473333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 4) the event must be unexpected and the failure to see the object or event must be due to the engagement of attention on other aspects of the visual scene and not due to aspects of the visual stimulus itself.&lt;ref name="Rock, 1992"/&gt; Individuals who experience inattentional blindness are usually unaware of this effect, which can play a subsequent role on behavior.

Inattentional blindness is related to but distinct from other failures of visual awareness such as [[change blindness]], [[repetition blindness]], [[visual masking]], and [[attentional blink]]. The key aspect of inattentional blindess which makes it distinct from other failures in [[awareness]] rests on the fact that the undetected stimulus is unexpected.&lt;ref name="driver,1998"/&gt; It is the unexpected nature of said stimulus that differentiates inattentional blindness from failures of awareness such as attentional failures like the aforementioned attentional blink. It is critical to acknowledge that occurrences of inattentional blindness are attributed to the failure to consciously attend to an item in the visual field as opposed the absence of [[Information processing theory#Cognitive processes|cognitive processing]].

Findings such as inattentional blindness – the failure to notice a fully visible but unexpected object because attention was engaged on another task, event, or object – has changed views on how the brain stores and integrates visual information, and has led to further questioning and investigation of the brain and importantly of [[Cognition|cognitive]] processes.

===Cognitive capture=== &lt;!-- Anchor for redirect: [Cognitive capture]. --&gt;
''Cognitive capture'' or, ''cognitive tunneling'', is an inattentional blindness phenomenon in which the observer is too focused on instrumentation, task at hand, internal thought, etc. and not on the present environment. For example, while driving, a driver focused on the speedometer and not on the road is suffering from cognitive capture.{{efn|Note: The term has also been applied to the "cognitive capture" of government [[regulatory agencies]] by the industries they are charged with regulating.  The regulators may be seen as being so "captured" by the industry that they focus all their energy on the welfare of the industry and not on the welfare of the public.  This concept may interact with "cognitive dissonance" to explain why people create local cultures that reflect some of the values in their local community, while completely ignoring others.}}

==The cognition debate: early vs. late selection of attention==
One of the most foremost conflicts among researchers of inattentional blindness surrounds the [[Information processing theory#Cognitive processes|processing]] of unattended stimuli. More specifically, there is disagreement in the literature about exactly how much processing of a visual scene is completed before selection dictates which stimuli will be [[Consciousness|consciously]] perceived, and which will not be (i.e. inattentional blindness). There exists two basic schools of thought on the issue – those who believe selection occurs early in the perceptual process, and those who believe it occurs only after significant processing.&lt;ref name="Spinks2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spinks | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = J. X. | last3 = Fox | first3 = P. T. | last4 = Gao | first4 = J-H. | last5 = Tan | first5 = L. H. | year = 2004 | title = More workload on the central executive of working [[memory]], less attention capture by novel visual distractors: evidence from an fMRI study | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 517–524 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.06.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early selection theorists propose that perception of stimuli is a limited process requiring selection to proceed. This suggests that the decision to attend to specific stimuli occurs early in processing, soon after the rudimentary study of physical features; only those selected stimuli are then fully processed. On the other hand, proponents of late selection theories argue that [[perception]] is an unlimited operation, and all stimuli in a visual scene are [[Parallel processing (psychology)|processed simultaneously]]. In this case, selection of relevant information is done after full processing of all stimuli.&lt;ref name="Lavie1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lavie | first1 = N. | last2 = Tsal | first2 = Y. | year = 1994 | title = Perceptual load as a major determinant of the locus of selection in visual attention | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 183–197 | doi=10.3758/bf03213897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While early research on the topic was heavily focused on early selection, research since the late 1970s has been shifted mainly to the late selection theories. This change resulted primarily from a shift in paradigms used to study inattentional blindness which revealed new aspects of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman, D.]], &amp; Treisman, A. (1984). [https://web.archive.org/web/20160604214805/https://faculty.washington.edu/jpalmer/files/forCM/FilteringPaperNewRefs/kahneman_treisman1984.pdf "Changing views of attention and automacity"]. In R. Parasuraman &amp; D.R Davies (Eds.), ''Varieties of Attention'' (pp. 29-61). New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; Today, late selection theories are generally accepted, and continue to be the focus of the majority of research concerning inattentional blindness.

===Evidence for late selection===
A significant body of research has been gathered in support of late selection in the perception of visual stimuli.

One of the popular ways of investigating late selection is to assess the [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] properties (i.e. influencing subsequent acts&lt;ref name="Mack2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mack | first1 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Inattentional blindness: Looking without seeing | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 180–184 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01256|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pcg/225/documents/InattentionalBLindness2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of unattended stimuli. Often used to demonstrate such effects is the stem completion task. While there exist a few variations, these studies generally consist of showing participants the first few letters of words, and asking them to complete the string of letters to form an English word.&lt;ref name="Mack2003"/&gt; It has been demonstrated that observers are significantly more likely to complete word fragments with the unattended stimuli presented in a trial than with another similar word.&lt;ref name="Mack1998"&gt;Mack, A. and Rock, I. (1998). ''Inattentional Blindness'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; This effect holds when stimuli are not words, but instead objects. When photos of objects are shown too quickly for participants to identify, subsequent presentation of those items lead to significantly faster identification in comparison to novel objects.&lt;ref name="Mack2003"/&gt;

A notable study by Mack and Rock has also revealed that showing a word stimulus differing from the participant's name by one letter did not generally call conscious attention. By simply changing a character, transforming the presented word into the observer's first name, the now highly meaningful stimulus is significantly more likely to be attended to. This suggests that the stimuli are being extensively processed, at least enough to analyze their meaning. These results point to the fact that attentional selection may be determined late in processing.&lt;ref name="Mack1998"/&gt;

The evidence outlined above suggests that even when stimuli are not processed to the level of conscious attention, they are nonetheless perceptually and cognitively processed, and can indeed exert effects on subsequent behavior.&lt;ref name="Mack2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mack |first1=A. |year=2001 |title=Inattentional blindness: Reply to commentaries |url=http://www.theassc.org/files/assc/2494.pdf |journal=Psyche |volume=7 |issue=16 |pages=1–7 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208072048/http://www.theassc.org/files/assc/2494.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }} [[PhilPapers]]: [http://philpapers.org/rec/MACIBR-2 MACIBR-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence for early selection===
While the evidence supporting late selection hypotheses is significant and has been consistently reproduced, there also exists a body of research suggesting that unattended stimuli in fact may not receive significant processing.

For example, in an [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) study by Rees and colleagues, brain activity was recorded while participants completed a perceptual task. Here they examined the neural processing of meaningful (words) and meaningless (consonant string) stimuli both when attended to, and when these same items were unattended. While no difference in activation patterns were found between the groups when the stimuli were unattended, differences in neural processing were observed for meaningful versus meaningless stimuli to which participants overtly attended. This pattern of results suggests that ignored stimuli are not processed to the level of meaning, i.e. less extensively than attended stimuli.&lt;ref name=Rees1999&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rees | first1 = G. | last2 = Russell | first2 = C. | last3 = Firth | first3 = C. | last4 = Driver | first4 = J. | year = 1999 | title = Inattentional blindness versus inattentional amnesia | url = | journal = Science | volume = 286 | issue = | pages = 849–860 |doi=10.1126/science.286.5449.2504 |pmid=10617465  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants do not seem to be detecting meaning in stimuli to which they are not consciously attending.

==Theories==

===Perceptual load===
This particular hypothesis bridges the gap between the early and late selection theories. Authors integrate the viewpoint of early selection stating that perception is a limited process (i.e. cognitive resources are limited), and that of the late selection theories assuming perception as an automatic process.&lt;ref name="Lavie1994" /&gt; This view proposes that the level of processing which occurs for any one stimulus is dependent on the current perceptual load. That is, if the current task is attentionally demanding and its processing exhausts all the available resources, little remains available to process other non-target stimuli in the visual field. Alternatively, if processing requires a small amount of attentional resources, perceptual load is low and attention is inescapably directed to the non-target stimuli.&lt;ref name="Spinks2004"/&gt;

The effects of perceptual load on the occurrence of inattentional blindness is demonstrated in a study by Fougnie and Marois. Here, participants were asked to complete a memory task involving either the simple maintenance of verbal stimuli, or the rearrangement of this material, a more cognitively demanding exercise. While subjects were completing the assigned task, an unexpected visual stimulus was presented. Results revealed that unexpected stimuli were more likely to be missed during manipulation of information than in the more simple rehearsal task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fougnie | first1 = D. | last2 = Marois | first2 = R. | year = 2007 | title = Executive working memory load induces inattentional blindness | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 142–147 | doi=10.3758/bf03194041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar type of study, fMRI recordings were done while subjects took part in either low-demand or high-demand subtraction tasks. While performing these exercises, novel visual distractors were presented. When task demands were low and used a smaller portion of the finite resources, distractors captured attention and sparked visual analysis as shown by brain activation in the [[Visual cortex|primary visual cortex]]. These results, however, did not hold when perceptual load was high; in this condition, distractors were significantly less often attended to and processed.&lt;ref name="Spinks2004"/&gt;

Thus, higher perceptual load, and therefore more significant use of attentional resources, appears to increase the likelihood of inattentional blindness episodes.

===Inattentional amnesia===
The theory of inattentional amnesia provides an alternative in the explanation of inattentional blindness in suggesting that the phenomenon does not stem from failures in capture of attention or in actual perception of stimuli, but instead from a failure in memory. The unnoticed stimuli in a visual scene are attended to and consciously perceived, but are rapidly forgotten rendering them impossible to report.&lt;ref name=Simons2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simons | first1 = D. J. | year = 2000 | title = Attentional capture and inattentional blindness | url = ftp://grey.colorado.edu/pub/oreilly/teach/prosem_highvis/Simons00.pdf | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 147–155 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01455-8|pmid=10740279}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, inattentional amnesia refers to the failure in creating a lasting explicit memory: by the time a subject is asked to recall seeing an item, their memory for the stimulus has vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, J.M. (1999). "Inattentional amnesia". In V. Coltheart (Ed.), ''Fleeting Memories'' (pp.71-94). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is difficult to tease apart a failure in perception from one in memory, some research has attempted to shed light on the issue. In a now-classic study of inattentional blindness, a woman carrying an umbrella through a scene goes unnoticed. Despite stopping the video while she is walking through and immediately asking participants to identify which of two people they have seen – leaving as little delay as possible between presentation and report – observers very often fail to correctly identify the woman with the umbrella. No differences in performance were identified whether the video was stopped immediately after the unexpected event or moments later. These findings would seem to oppose the idea of inattentional amnesia, however advocates of the theory could always contend that the memory test simply came too late and that the memory had already been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Becklen | first1 = R. | last2 = Cervone | first2 = D. | year = 1983 | title = Selective looking and the noticing of unexpected events | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 601–608 | doi=10.3758/bf03198284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expectation===
The very phenomenon of inattentional blindness is defined by a lack of expectation for the unattended stimulus. Some researchers believe that it is not inattention that produces blindness, but in fact the aforementioned lack of expectation for the stimuli.&lt;ref name="Mack2001"/&gt; Proponents of this theory often state that classic methods for testing inattentional blindness are not manipulating attention per se, but instead the expectation for the presentation of a visual item.&lt;ref name=Braun2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braun |first1=J |year=2001 |title=It's great but not necessarily about attention |journal=Psyche |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=1–7 |url=http://www.theassc.org/files/assc/2500.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208072757/http://www.theassc.org/files/assc/2500.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2012 |df=dmy-all}} [[PhilPapers]]: [http://philpapers.org/rec/BRAIGB BRAIGB]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies investigating the effect of expectation on episodes of inattentional blindness have shown that once observers are made aware of the importance of the stimuli to be presented, for example stating that one will later be tested on it, the phenomenon essentially disappears.&lt;ref name="Mack1998"/&gt; While admitting to possible ambiguities in methodology, Mack, one of the foremost researchers in the field, holds strongly that inattentional blindness stems predominantly from a failure of attentional capture. She points out that if expectation does not mediate instances of very closely linked phenomena such as [[attentional blink]] and [[change blindness]] (whereby participants have difficulty identifying the changing object even when they are explicitly told to look for it), it is unlikely that inattentional blindness can be explained solely by a lack of expectation for stimulus presentation.&lt;ref name="Mack2001"/&gt;

===Perceptual cycle===
The perceptual cycle framework has been used as another theoretical basis for inattentional blindness. The perceptual cycle framework describes attention capture and awareness capture as occurring at two different stages of processing. Attention capture occurs when there is a shift in attention due to the salience of a stimuli, and awareness capture refers to the conscious acknowledgement of stimuli. Attentional sets are important because it is composed of characteristics of stimuli an individual is processing. Inattentional blindness occurs when there is an interaction between an individual's attentional set and the salience of the unexpected stimulus. Recognizing the unexpected stimulus can occur when the characteristics of the unexpected stimulus resembles the characteristics of the perceived stimuli. The attentional set theory of inattentional blindness has implications for false memories and eyewitness testimony. The perceptual cycle framework offers four major implications about inattentional blindness 1) environmental cues aid in the detection of stimuli by providing orienting cues but is not enough to produce awareness, 2) perception requires effortful sustained attention, interpretation, and reinterpretation, 3) implicit memory may precede conscious perception, and 4) visual stimuli that is not expected, explored, or interpreted may not be perceived.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | title = What You See Is What You Set: Sustained Inattentional Blindness and the Capture of Awareness|journal=Psychological Review|pages= 217–242| doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.112.1.217 | year = 2005 | last1 = Most | first1 = Steven B. | last2 = Scholl | first2 = Brian J. | last3 = Simons | first3 = Daniel J. | last4 = Clifford | first4 = Erin R. | volume = 112 | issue = 1 |url = http://perception.research.yale.edu/papers/05-Most-EtAl-PsychRev.pdf |pmid=15631594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other bases for attentional blindness include top down and bottom up processing.

==Experiments==
To test for inattentional blindness, researchers ask participants to complete a primary task while an unexpected stimulus is presented. Afterwards, researchers ask participants if they saw anything unusual during the primary task. Arien Mack and Irvin Rock describe a series of experiments that demonstrated inattentional blindness in their 1998 book, ''Inattentional Blindness.''

===Invisible Gorilla Test===
{{further|The Invisible Gorilla}}
The best-known study demonstrating inattentional blindness is the Invisible Gorilla Test, conducted by [[Daniel Simons]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and [[Christopher Chabris]] of [[Harvard University]]. This study, a revised version of earlier studies conducted by Ulric Neisser, Neisser and Becklen in 1975, asked subjects to watch a short video of two groups of people (wearing black and white T-shirts) passing a basketball around. The subjects are told either to count the passes made by one of the teams or to keep count of bounce passes vs. aerial passes. In different versions of the video a woman walks through the scene carrying an umbrella (as discussed above) or wearing a full gorilla suit. After watching the video, the subjects are asked whether they noticed anything out of the ordinary taking place. In most groups, 50% of the subjects did not report seeing the gorilla (or the woman with the umbrella). Failure to perceive the anomalies is attributed to failure to attend to it while engaged in the difficult task of counting passes of the ball. These results indicate that the relationship between what is in one's visual field and perception is based much more on attention than was previously thought.&lt;ref name=Most2001&gt;{{cite journal |title=How not to be seen: the contribution of similarity and selective ignoring to sustained inattentional blindness |journal=Psychological Science |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=9–17 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11294235 |doi= 10.1111/1467-9280.00303 |url= |last1=Most |first1=S.

Out 228 participants of the tests, only 194 – those who did count the passes correctly – were used for statistical purposes further. The percentage was even as low as 8% in one of the 16 tests performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/videos.html ''Change Blindness Study'']; "The Invisible Gorilla" online; retrieved ?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simons |first1=D.

The basic Simons and Chabris study was reused on British television as a public safety advert designed to point out the potential dangers to cyclists caused by inattentional blindness in motorists. In the advert the gorilla is replaced by a moon-walking bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/16/transport-invisible-bear-cyclists-youtube |first=Tracy |last=McVeigh |title=Invisible bear makes cyclists safer|date=2008-11-16 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A real-world experiment===
In 1995, Officer Kenny Conley was chasing a shooting suspect. An undercover officer was in the same vicinity and was mistakenly taken down by other officers while Conley ran by and failed to notice. A jury later convicted Officer Conley of perjury and obstruction of justice, believing he had seen the fight and lied about it to protect fellow officers, yet he stood by his word that he had, in fact, not seen it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kenneth Conley |publisher=National Registry of Exonerations |url=https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Chabris, Adam Weinberger, Matthew Fontaine and Daniel J. Simons took it upon themselves to see if this scenario was possible. They designed an experiment in which participants were asked to run about 30 feet behind an experimenter, and count how many times he touched his head. A fight was staged to appear about 8 meters off the path, and was visible for approximately 15 seconds. The procedure in its entirety lasted about 2 minutes and 45 seconds, and participants were then asked to report the number of times they had seen the experimenter touch his head with either hand (medium load), both hands (high load), or were not instructed to count at all (low load). After the run, participants were asked 3 questions: 1) If they had noticed the fight; 2) if they had noticed a juggler, and 3) if they had noticed someone dribbling a basketball. Questions 2) and 3) were control questions, and no one falsely reported these as true.

Participants were significantly more likely to notice the fight when the experiment was done during the day as opposed to in the dark. Additionally, sightings of the fight were most likely to be reported in the low load condition (72%) than in either the medium load (56%), or high load conditions (42%).&lt;ref name=fightclub&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chabris|first1=CF|last2=Weinberger|first2=A|last3=Fontaine|first3=M|last4=Simons|first4=DJ|doi=10.1068/i0436|PMC=3485775|title=You do not talk about Fight Club if you do not notice Fight Club: Inattentional blindness for a simulated real-world assault.|journal=i-Perception|date=2011|volume=2|issue=2|pages=150–3|pmid=23145232}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results exemplify a real world occurrence of inattentional blindness, and provide evidence that officer Conley could indeed have missed the fight because his attention was focused elsewhere. Moreover, these results add to the body of knowledge suggesting that as perceptual load increases, less resources remain to process items not explicitly focused on, and in turn episodes of inattentional blindness become more frequent.

===Computer red cross experiment===
Another experiment was conducted by Steven Most, along with [[Daniel Simons]], Christopher Chabris and Brian Scholl. Instead of a basketball game, they used stimuli presented by computer displays. In this experiment objects moved randomly on a computer screen. Participants were instructed to attend to the black objects and ignore the white, or vice versa. After several trials, a red cross unexpectedly appeared and traveled across the display, remaining on the computer screen for five seconds. The results of the experiment showed that even though the cross was distinctive from the black and white objects both in color and shape, about a third of participants missed it. They had found that people may be attentionally tuned to certain perceptual dimensions, such as brightness or shape. Inattentional blindness is most likely to occur if the unexpected stimuli presented resembles the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Carpenter | first1= Siri|year= 2001|title= Sights Unseen|journal= Monitor on Psychology|volume= 32 |issue =4 |page=54 | url = http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr01/blindness.aspx | accessdate=10 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clown on a unicycle ===
One interesting experiment displayed how cell phones contributed to inattentional blindness in basic tasks such as walking. The stimulus for this experiment was a brightly colored clown on a unicycle. The individuals participating in this experiment were divided into four sections. They were either talking on the phone, listening to an mp3 player, walking by themselves or walking in pairs. The study showed that individuals engaged in cell phone conversations were least likely to notice the clown. This experiment was designed by Ira E. Hyman, S. Matthew Boss, Breanne M. Wise, Kira E. Mckenzie and Jenna M. Caggiano at Western Washington University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/acp.1638 | pages = 597–607 | title=Did you see the unicycling clown?

===Blindness despite fixation===
Daniel Memmert conducted an experiment which suggests that an individual can look directly at an object and still not perceive it. This experiment was based on the invisible gorilla experiment. The participants were children with an average age of 7.7 years. Participants watched a short video of a six-player basketball game (three with white shirts, three with black shirts). The participants were instructed to watch only the players wearing black shirts and to count the times the team passed the ball. During the video a person in a gorilla suit walks through the scene. The film was projected onto a large screen (3.2 m X 2.4 m) and the participants sat in a chair 6 meters from the screen. Participants' eye movement and fixations were recorded during the video, and afterward the participants answered a series of questions.

Only 40% of the participants reported seeing the gorilla. There was no significant difference in accuracy of the counting between the two groups. Analyzing the eye movement and fixation data showed no significant difference in time spent looking at the players (black or white) between the two groups. However, the 60% of participants who did not report seeing the gorilla spent an average of 25 frames (about one second) fixated on the gorilla, despite not perceiving it.&lt;ref name="Memmert2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Memmert |first=D |title=The effects of eye movements, age, and expertise on inattentional blindness |journal=Consciousness and Cognition |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=620–7 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16487725 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.01.001 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more common example of blindness despite fixation is illustrated in the game of [[Three-card Monte]].

===Effects of expertise===
Another experiment conducted by Daniel Memmert tested the effects of different levels of expertise can have on inattentional blindness. The participants in this experiment included six different groups: Adult basketball experts with an average of twelve years of experience, junior basketball experts with an average of five years, children who had practiced the game for an average of two years, and novice counterparts for each age group. In this experiment the participants watched the invisible gorilla experiment video. The participants were instructed to watch only the players wearing white and to count the times the team passed the ball.

The results showed that experts did not count the passes more accurately than novices but did show that adult subjects were more accurate than the junior and child subjects. A much higher percentage of experts noticed the gorilla compared with novices and even the practiced children. 62% of the adult experts and 60% of the junior experts noticed the gorilla, suggesting that the difference between five and twelve years of experience has minimal effect on inattentional blindness. However, only 38% of the adult, 35% of the junior, and none of the child novices noticed the gorilla. Only 18% of the children with two years of practice noticed. This suggests that both age and experience can have a significant effect on inattentional blindness.&lt;ref name="Memmert2006" /&gt;

==Limitations of perception or memory?==
Arien Mack and Irvin Rock's concluded in 1998 that no conscious perception can occur without attention.&lt;ref name=Mack1998 /&gt; Evidence through research on inattentional blindness contemplates that it may be possible that inattentional blindness reflects a problem with memory rather than with perception.&lt;ref name=Mack1998 /&gt; It is argued that at least some instances of inattentional blindness are better characterized as memory failures than perceptual failures. The extent to which unattended stimuli fail to engage perceptual processing is an empirical question that the combination of inattentional blindness and other various measures of processing can be used to address.&lt;ref name="Rock, 1992" /&gt;

The theory behind inattentional blindness research suggests that we consciously experience only those objects and events to which we directly attend.&lt;ref name=Mack1998 /&gt; That means that the vast majority of information in our field of vision goes unnoticed. Thus if we miss the target stimulus in an experiment, but are later told about the existence of the stimulus, this sufficient awareness allows participants to report and recall the stimulus now that attention has been allocated to it.&lt;ref name="Rock, 1992" /&gt; Mack and Rock, and their colleagues discovered a striking array of visual events to which people are inattentionally blind.&lt;ref name=Mack1998 /&gt; However the debate arises whether this inattentional blindness was due to memory or perceptual processing limitations.

Mack and Rock note that explanations for inattentional blindness can reflect a basic failure of perceptual processes to be engaged by unattended stimuli. Or that it may reflect a failure of memorial processes to encode information about unattended stimuli. It is important to note that the memory failure does not have to do with forgetting something that has been encoded by losing access to the memory of the stimulus from time of presentation to time of retrieval, rather that the failure is attributed to information not being encoded when the stimulus was present.&lt;ref name=Mack1998 /&gt; It seems that inattentional blindness can be explained by both memory and perceptual failures because in experimental research participants may fail to report what was on display due to failures in encoded information (memory) or a failure in perceptually processed information (perception).&lt;ref name=Mack1998 /&gt;

==Neuropsychological analogies==
There are similarities in the types of unconscious processing apparent in inattentional blindness and in neuropsychological syndromes such as visual neglect and extinction. The analogy between these phenomenon's seems to generate more questions as well as answers. These answers are fundamental for our understanding of the relationship between attention, stimulus coding and behavior.

===Visual neglect===
[[File:Parietal lobe animation small.gif|thumb|left|Animation. Parietal lobe (red) of left cerebral hemisphere.]]

Research has shown that some aspects of the syndrome of unilateral '''visual neglect''' appear to be similar to normal subjects in a state of inattentional blindness. In neglect, patients with lesions to the [[parietal cortex]] fail to respond to and report stimuli presented on the side of space [[wikt:contralateral|contralateral]] to damage.&lt;ref name="Mack2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = C. M. | last2 = Egeth | first2 = H. | year = 1997 | title = Perception without attention: Evidence of grouping under conditions of inattention | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 339–352 | doi=10.1037/0096-1523.23.2.339}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, they appear to be functionally blind to a range of stimuli. Since such lesions do not result in any sensory deficits, shortcomings have been explained in terms of a lack of attentional processing, for which the parietal cortex plays a large role.&lt;ref&gt;Rafal, R. (1998). "Neglect." In R. Parasuraman (Ed.), ''The Attentive Brain'' (pp.489-526). Cambridge. MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These phenomena draw strong parallels to one another, as in both cases stimuli are perceptible but unreported when unattended.

===Extinction===
In the phenomenon of '''extinction''', patients can report the presence of a single stimulus presented on the affected side, but then fail to detect it when a second stimulus is presented simultaneously on the "good" ([[wikt:ipsilateral|ipsilateral]]) side.&lt;ref name="humphreys,1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Humphreys | first1 = G.W. | last2 = Romani | first2 = C. | last3 = Olson | first3 = A. | last4 = Riddoch | first4 = M.J. | last5 = Duncan | first5 = J. | year = 1994 | title = Non-spatial extinction following lesions of the parietal lobe in humans | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 372 | issue = | pages = 357–359 | doi=10.1038/372357a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the stimulus on the affected side seems to lose under conditions of attentional competition from stimuli in the ipsilesional field.&lt;ref name="humphreys,1994"/&gt; The consequence of this competition is that the extinguished items may not be detected.

Similar to studies of inattentional blindness, there is evidence of processing taking place in the neglected field. For example, there can be semantic priming from a stimulus presented in the neglected field, which affects responses to stimuli subsequently presented on the unimpaired side.&lt;ref name="MR"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mack | first1 = A. | last2 = Tang | first2 = B. | last3 = Tuma | first3 = R. | last4 = Rock | first4 = I. | year = 1992 | title = Perceptual organization and attention | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 475–501 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(92)90016-u}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently in both neglect and inattentional blindness, there is some level processing of stimuli even when they are unattended.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt; However one major difference between neuropsychological symptoms such as neglect and extinction, and inattentional blindness concerns the role of expectation.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt; In inattentional blindness, subjects do not expect the unreported stimulus. In contrast, in neglect and extinction, patients may expect a stimulus to be presented on the affected side but still fail to report it when another it may be that expectation affects reportability but not the implicit processing of stimuli.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt;

Further explanations of the phenomenon of inattentional blindness include inattentional amnesia, inattentional agnosia and change blindness.

===Inattentional agnosia===
An explanation for this phenomenon is that observers see the critical object in their visual field but fail to process it extensively enough to retain it. Individuals experience '''inattentional agnosia''' after having seen the target stimuli but not consciously being able to identify what the stimuli is. It is possible that observers are not even able to identify that the stimuli they are seeing are coherent objects.&lt;ref&gt;Neisser, U. (1967). Cognitive psychology. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus observers perceive some representation of the stimuli but are actually unaware of what that stimulus is. It is because the stimulus is not encoded as a specific thing, that it later is not remembered. Individuals fail to report what the stimuli is after it has been removed. However, despite a lack in ability to fully process the stimuli, experiments have shown a priming effect of the critical stimuli. This priming effect indicates that the stimuli must have been processed to some degree, this occurs even if observers are unable to report what the stimuli is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yantis | first1 = S | year = 1999 | title = Seeing is attending | url = | journal = Contemporary Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 314–316 | doi=10.1037/002042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change blindness===
Inattentional blindness is the failure to see a stimulus, such as an object that is present in a visual field. However, '''change blindness''' is the failure to notice something different about a visual display. Change blindness is a directly related to memory, individuals who experience the effects of change blindness fail to notice something different about a visual display from one moment to the next.&lt;ref name="driver,1998"&gt;Driver, J. (1998). "The neuropsychology of spatial attention." In H. Pashler (Ed.), ''Attention.'' (pp. 297-340). London: Taylor Francis&lt;/ref&gt; In experiments that test for this phenomenon participants are shown an image that is then followed by another duplicate image that has had a single change made to it. Participants are asked to compare and contrast the two images and identify what the change is. In inattentional blindness experiments, participants fail to identify some stimulus in a single display, a phenomenon that doesn't rely on memory the way change blindness does.&lt;ref name="driver,1998"/&gt; Inattentional blindness refers to an inability to identify an object all together whereas change blindness is a failure to compare a new image or display to one that was previously stored in memory.&lt;ref name="driver,1998"/&gt;

==Additional factors exhibiting effects on it==

===Age and expertise===
In 2006, Daniel Memmert conducted a series of studies in which he tested the how age and expertise of participants affect inattentional blindness. Using the gorilla video, he tested 6 different groups of participants. There were 2 groups of children (average age=7) half with no experience in basketball, and the other half with 2 years experience; 2 groups of juniors (average age=13) half with no experience in basketball, and the other half with 5 years of experience; and 2 groups of adults (average age = 24) half with no experience in basketball, the other half with over 12 years of experience. He then instructed all the groups to keep track of how many passes the people on the black team made.

Overall, the children with or without any basketball experience failed to perceive the gorilla more than the juniors or the adults. There were no significant difference between the inexperienced junior and adult groups, or between the experienced junior and adult groups.&lt;ref name="Memmert2006"/&gt; This pattern of results suggests that until the approximate age of 13, presumably because certain aspects of cognition are still under development, inattentional blindness occurrences are more frequent, but become consistent throughout the remainder of the life span.

Additionally, the juniors with basketball experience noticed the gorilla significantly more than the juniors with no basketball experience; and the group of experienced adults noticed the gorilla significantly more than the non-experienced adults. This suggests that if one has had much experience with the stimuli in a visual field, they are more likely to consciously perceive the unexpected object.

In 2011, Elizabeth Graham and Deborah Burke conducted a study that assessed whether or not older adults are more susceptible to inattentional blindness than younger adults by having 51 younger-aged participants (17 to 22 years) and 61 older-aged participants (61 to 81 years) watch the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo classic gorilla video]. Overall, they found that younger-aged participants were more likely to notice the unexpected gorilla than older-aged participants.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Burke|first2=Deborah|title=Aging increases inattentional blindness to the gorilla in our midst.|journal=Psychology and Aging|date=2011|volume=26|issue=1|pages=162–166|doi=10.1037/a0020647|pmc=3062668|pmid=21261412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this study, participants were tasked with counting the number of times a number of white moving objects crossed the vertical midpoint of a display while ignoring a number of black moving objects. The unexpected object in this case was a gray cross that moved horizontally across the display at various distances from the vertical midpoint (this was manipulated between participants). Overall, they found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which replicates the finding from Graham and Burke. In fact, they found that every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. They also found that the probability of inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, which replicates the finding from Most and colleagues. However, they also found that the relationship that age has with inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.

===Similarity between stimuli===
A series of studies conducted to test how similarity can influence the [[perception]] of a present stimulus. In the study, they asked participants to fixate on a central point on a computer screen and count how many times either white or black letters bounced off the edges of the screen. The first 2 trials did not contain an unexpected event, but the third trial was the critical trial in which a cross that had the same dimensions as the letters and varied in colour (white/light gray/dark gray/black) moved from the right side of the screen to the left side and passed through the central point. The results revealed the following: during the critical event, the more similar the colour of the cross was to the colour of the attended letters, the more likely the participants were to perceive it, and the less similar the colour of the cross was to the attended colour decreased the likelihood of the cross being noticed. For the participants attending to the black letters, 94% perceived the black cross; 44% perceived the dark gray cross; 12% perceived the light gray cross, and only 6% perceived the white cross. Similarly, if the participant was attending to the white letters, they were more likely to notice the cross it was white (94%) than if it was light gray (75%), dark gray (56%), or black (0%).&lt;ref name=Most2001/&gt; This study demonstrates that the more similar an unexpected object is to the attended object, the more likely it is to be perceived, thus reducing the chance of inattentional blindness.

===Mindfulness===
A large experiment conducted on 794 participants by Schofield, Creswell and Denson&lt;ref name=schofield2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schofield|first1=Timothy P.|last2=Creswell|first2=J. David|last3=Denson|first3=Thomas F.|title=Brief mindfulness induction reduces inattentional blindness|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=2015|volume=37|pages=63–70|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2015.08.007|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Timothy_Schofield/publication/281333314_Brief_mindfulness_induction_reduces_inattentional_blindness/links/55e5005608aede0b57358792/Brief-mindfulness-induction-reduces-inattentional-blindness.pdf?origin=publication_detail&amp;ev=pub_int_prw_xdl}}&lt;/ref&gt; found evidence that completing a brief mindfulness exercise reduced rates on inattentional blindness, but did not improve the depth of encoding of the unexpected distractor. Participants in this experiment engaged in a guided-audio task of mindfully eating a raisin, [[Mindfulness#meditation|a well-known task introduced by Kabat-Zinn in his mindfulness-based stress reduction program]], or listened to factual descriptions about raisins. The audio recordings used to manipulate mindful states in this experiment are freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schofield T. P., Creswell D., Denson T. F. | year = 2015 | title = Brief mindfulness induction reduces inattentional blindness | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 63–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants who completed the raisin-eating task had 41% greater odds of noticing an unexpected red cross that floated across the screen. Participants were then asked to select the shape that had unexpectedly appeared (i.e., the red cross) out of a line-up of 3 red and 3 green shapes. Those in the mindfulness condition were no better than those in the control condition at selecting the red cross out of the line-up. This was true regardless of whether or not detection of the unexpected distractor was statistically controlled. This experiment demonstrated that not only does mindfulness affect inattentional blindness, but that detailed encoding of the unexpected distractor can be dissociated from the detection of the unexpected distractor.

==Possible causes==
The research that has been done on inattentional blindness suggests that there are four possible causes for this phenomenon.  These include: conspicuity, mental workload, expectations, and capacity.&lt;ref name="Mack2003"/&gt;

=== Conspicuity===
Conspicuity refers to an object's ability to catch a person's attention. When something is conspicuous it is easily visible. There are two factors which determine conspicuity: sensory conspicuity and cognitive conspicuity. Sensory conspicuity factors are the physical properties an object has. If an item has bright colors, flashing lights, high contrast with environment, or other attention-grabbing physical properties it can attract a person's attention much easier. For example, people tend to notice objects that are bright colors or crazy patterns before they notice other objects. Cognitive conspicuity factors pertain to objects that are familiar to someone. People tend to notice objects faster if they have some meaning to their lives. For example, when a person hears his/her name, their attention is drawn to the person who said it. The [[cocktail party effect]] describes the cognitive conspicuity factor as well. When an object isn't conspicuous, it is easier to be inattentionally blind to it. People tend to notice items if they capture their attention in some way. If the object isn't visually prominent or relevant, there is a higher chance that a person will miss it.

=== Mental workload and working memory===
[[Mental workload]] is a person's cognitive resources. The amount of a person's workload can interfere with processing of other stimuli. When a person focuses a lot of attention on one stimulus, he/she focuses less attention on other stimuli. For example, talking on the phone while driving – the attention is mostly focused on the phone conversation, so there is less attention focused on driving. The mental workload could be anything from thinking about tasks that need to be done to tending to a baby in the backseat. When people have most of their attention focused on one thing, they are more vulnerable to inattentional blindness. However, the opposite is true as well. When a person has a very small mental workload – he/she is doing an everyday task – the task becomes automatic. Automatic processing can lessen one's mental workload, which can lead to a person to missing the unexpected stimuli.

[[Working memory]] also contributes to inattentional blindness. Cognitive psychologists have examined the relationship between working memory and inattention, but evidence is inconclusive. The rate of this phenomenon can be impacted by a number of factors. Researchers have found evidence for a number of components that may play a role. These include features of the object and the current task, where an individual's attention lies relative to the object, and mental workload as mentioned above. Researchers Kreitz, Furley, and Memmery in 2015, asserted that working memory capacity is not an indicator of susceptibility to inattentional blindness. Instead, it is a combination of what stimulus the attention is directed to as well as the individual's personal expectations. There are individual differences that can play a role, but some argue those disparities are separate from capacity for working memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kreitz |first1=Carina |last2=Furley |first2=Phillip |last3=Memmert |first3=Daniel |last4=Simons |first4=Daniel J. |title=The Influence of Attention Set, Working Memory Capacity, and Expectations on Inattentional Blindness |journal=Perception |date=April 2016 |volume=45 |issue=4 |doi=10.1177/0301006615614465 |pages=386–399}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there are researchers who consider differences between individuals and their working memory capacity to be a stronger determinant of inattentional blindness. Seegmiller, Watson, and Strayer in 2011 for example, studied individual differences in working memory capacity and how that overall impacted their attention on a given task. They utilized the same Invisible Gorilla video Simons and Chabris did (as mentioned above), but they additionally had participants complete a mathematics test to measure their capacity. From their results, they were able to find a high correlation between an individual's working memory capacity and their susceptibility to inattentional blindness. Those who were calculated to have a lower capacity, more often experienced the blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seegmiller|first=Janelle K.|date=May 2011|title=Individual differences in susceptibility to inattentional blindness|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=37|issue=3|doi=10.1037/a0022474|pages=785–791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow up study the same year, Kreitz and her team looked specifically at the cognitive abilities between individuals. Her team employed a variety of tasks, both static and dynamic, to compare the participants who had their cognitive capacity measured beforehand. Even though they included different tasks to test individuals, there was not a measurable relationship between the cognitive abilities of a participant and their attention performance. They did, however, find evidence to support the idea that noticing a certain stimuli was better in those demonstrating expertise in the task subject (referenced above). Overall, Kreitz concluded that cognitive/working memory capacity might not be an accurate measure for inattentional blindness. Instead, they determined that the rate of noticing might be both circumstantial and dependent on the requirements of the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kreitz|first1=Carina|last2=Furley|first2=Phillip|last3=Memmert|first3=Daniel|last4=Simons|first4=Daniel J.|title=Inattentional blindness and individual differences in cognitive abilities|journal=PLOS ONE|date=10 August 2015|volume=10|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0134675|page=e0134675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also researchers who subscribe to the idea that working memory does not play a measurable role in attentional blindness. This is different from the study by Kreitz and her team finding that individual differences in cognitive abilities might not be relative to noticing rates. Bredemeier and Simons conducted two studies in 2012. The first involved identifying the location of letters as well as counting how many times a group of shapes touched one another. These served as spatial and attention tasks respectively. The second study utilized the same tasks as the previous, but included a verbal one. Participants had to solve math problems and then remember a particular letter that followed each equation. From their results, the two researchers questioned if there was a relationship between noticing a particular stimuli and cognitive abilities. Instead of other factors contributing to the working memory of an individual's noticing, Bredemeier and Simons postulated that external variables establish the appearance of this relationship. Finally, the two researchers attempted to explain why studies were yielding conflicting results. The reason for why this research seems particularly inconclusive might be a result of disparities between the design of the actual research. Essentially, a variety of confounded variables might be prevalent across the studies when considering methodology and sampling processes. A more regulated, large-scale experiment could lead to more conclusive findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bredemeier|first1=Keith|last2=Simons|first2=Daniel J.|title=Working memory and inattentional blindness|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=6 January 2012|volume=19|issue=2|doi=10.3758/s13423-011-0204-8|pages=239–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expectation===
When a person expects certain things to happen, he/she tends to block out other possibilities. This can lead to inattentional blindness. For example, person X is looking for their friend at a concert, and that person knows their friend (person Y) was wearing a yellow jacket. In order to find person Y, person X looks around for people wearing yellow. It is easier to pick a color out of the crowd than a person. However, if person Y took off the jacket, there is a chance person X could walk right past person Y and not notice because he/she was looking for the yellow jacket. Because of expectations, experts are more prone to inattentional blindness than beginners. An expert knows what to expect when certain situations arise. Therefore, that expert will know what to look for. This could cause that person to miss out on other important details that he/she may not have been looking for.

=== Capacity===
Attentional capacity, or [[Salience (neuroscience)|neurological salience]], is a measure of how much attention must be focused to complete a task. For example, an expert pianist can play a piano without thinking much, but a beginner would have to consciously think of every note they hit. This capacity can be lessened by drugs, alcohol, fatigue, and age. With a small capacity, it is more possible to miss things. Therefore, if a person is drunk, he/she will probably miss more than a sober person would. If your attentional capacity is large, you are less likely to experience inattentional blindness.

==Benefits==
[[William James]] addressed the benefits of [[attention]] by saying, "Only those items which I notice shape my mind – without selective interest, experience is utter chaos".&lt;ref name="camc"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130205233859/http://www.camc.ca/en/SMS_40/Articles_270.html ''Inattentional Blindness: Let's Not Blame The Victim Just Yet'']; 18(1), 23-29; Canadian Aviation Maintenance Council (CAMC); 2002; retrieved ? &lt;!-- The original link with full text is dead and not stored on archive.org http://www.camc.ca/fr/SMS_40/Articles_270/8.html --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have a limited mental capacity that is incapable of attending to all the sights, sounds and other inputs that rush the senses every moment. Inattentional blindness is beneficial in the sense that it is a mechanism that has evolved with attention to help filter out irrelevant input, allowing only important information to reach consciousness.&lt;ref name="camc"/&gt; Several researchers, notably [[James J. Gibson]], have argued that, even before the [[retina]], perception begins in the ecology, which has turned perceptual processes into informational relationships in the environment through [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="beware"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0707885104|title=Has evolution primed humans to "beware the beast"?|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=104|issue=42|pages=16396–16397|year=2007|last1=Ohman|first1=A.|pmid=17925439|pmc=2034250}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows humans to focus our limited mental resources more efficiently in our environment. For example, New et al. maintain that survival required monitoring animals, both human and non-human, to become part of the evolutionary adaptiveness of the human species. They found that when participants were shown an image with a rapidly altering scene where the scene change included an animate or inanimate object that the participants were significantly better at identifying humans and animals. New et al. argue that better performance in detecting animals and humans is not a factor of acquired expertise, rather it is an evolved survival mechanism in human perception.&lt;ref name="beware"/&gt;

Inattentional blindness is also beneficial as a response to advertising overload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Ternay |first1=Guerric |title=Purposeful Blindness: How Customers Dodge Your Ads |url=https://boostcompanies.com/purposeful-blindness/ |publisher= BoostCompanies |accessdate= 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irrelevant marketing makes it more likely for consumers to ignore initiatives that aim at capturing their attention. This phenomenon called 'purposeful blindness' has a compelling illustration regarding banner ads. [[Banner blindness]] shows that consumers can adopt fast and become good at ignoring marketing messages that are not relevant.

==Broader implications==
Although the bulk of inattentional blindness research has been conducted in laboratory studies, the phenomenon occurs in a variety of everyday contexts. Depending upon the context, the occurrence of inattentional blindness could range from embarrassing and/or humorous to potentially devastating.

===Safety===
Several recent studies of explicit attention capture have found that when observers are focused on some other object or event, they often experience inattentional blindness.&lt;ref name=Simons2000/&gt; This finding has potentially tragic implications for [[distracted driving]]. If a person's attention is focused elsewhere while driving, carrying on a conversation or text messaging, for example, they could fail to notice salient and distinctive objects, such as a stop sign, which could lead to serious injury and possibly even death. There have also been heinous incidents attributed to inattentional blindness behind the wheel. For example, a Pennsylvania highway crew accidentally paved over a dead deer that was lying on the road. When questioned regarding their actions, the workers claimed to have never seen it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Many policies are being implemented around the world to decrease the competition for explicit attention capture while operating a vehicle. For example, there are legislative efforts in many countries aimed at banning or restricting the use of [[cell phones]] while driving. Research has shown that the use of both hands-free and hand-held cellular devices while driving results in the failure of attention to explicitly capture other salient and distinctive objects, leading to significantly delayed reaction times, as well as inattentional blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horrey | first1 = W. J. | last2 = Wickens | first2 = C. D. | year = 2006 | title = Examining the Impact of Cell Phone Conversations on Driving Using Meta-Analytic Techniques | url = http://dept.wofford.edu/neuroscience/NeuroSeminar/pdfFall2011/HorreyWickens2006_wk1_driving.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Human Factors | volume = 48 | issue = 196| pages = 196–205 | doi=10.1518/001872006776412135}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 1997, based on accident data in [[Toronto]], found the risk involved in driving while using a cell phone to be similar to that of driving drunk. In both cases, the risk of a collision was three to six times higher compared to a sober driver not using a cell phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1056/NEJM199702133360701|pmid= 9017937|title= Association between Cellular-Telephone Calls and Motor Vehicle Collisions|journal= New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 336|issue= 7|pages=453–458|year= 1997|last1= Redelmeier|first1= Donald A.|last2= Tibshirani|first2= Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Strayer et al. (2006) found that when controlling for driving difficulty and time on task, cell-phone drivers exhibited greater impairment than intoxicated drivers, using a high-fidelity [[driving simulator]].&lt;ref name=Strayer2006&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1518/001872006777724471 |url=http://www.distraction.gov/downloads/pdfs/a-comparison-of-the-cell-phone-driver-and-the-drunk-driver.pdf |title=A Comparison of the Cell Phone Driver and the Drunk Driver |journal=Human Factors: the Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=381–391 |year=2006 |last1=Strayer |first1=David L. |last2=Drews |first2=Frank A. |last3=Crouch |first3=Dennis J. |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527164034/http://www.distraction.gov/downloads/pdfs/a-comparison-of-the-cell-phone-driver-and-the-drunk-driver.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inattentional blindness is also prevalent in aviation. The development of [[heads-up display]] (HUD) for pilots, which projects information onto the windshield or onto a helmet-mounted display, has enabled pilots to keep their eyes on the windshield, but simulator studies have found that HUD may cause runway incursion accidents, where one plane collides with another on the runway.&lt;ref name="camc"/&gt; This finding is particularly concerning because HUDs are being employed in automobiles, which could lead to potential roadway incursions.&lt;ref name="camc"/&gt; When a particular object or event captures attention to the extent to which the beholders' attentional capacity is completely absorbed, the resulting inattentional blindness has been known to cause dramatic accidents. For example, an airliner crew, engrossed with a blinking console light, failed to notice the approaching ground and register hearing the danger alarm sounding before the airliner crashed.&lt;ref name="camc"/&gt;

===Illusion===
Collaborative efforts to establish links between science and illusion have examined the relationship of the processes underlying inattentional blindness and the concept of [[Misdirection (magic)|misdirection]]—a magician's ability to manipulate attention in order to prevent his/her audience from seeing how a trick was performed. In several misdirection studies, including Kuhn and Tatler (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuhn | first1 = G. | last2 = Tatler | first2 = B.W. | year = 2005 | title = Magic and fixation: Now you don't see it, now you do. | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 35 | issue = 9| pages = 1155–1161 | doi=10.1068/p3409bn1}}&lt;/ref&gt; participants watch a "vanishing item" magic trick. After the initial trial, participants are shown the trick until they detect the item dropping from the magician's hand. Most participants see the item drop on the second trial. The critical analyses involved differences in eye movements between the detected and undetected trials. These repetition trials are similar to the full-attention trial in the inattentional blindness paradigm, as both involve the detection of the unexpected event and, by detecting the unexpected event on the second trial, demonstrate that the event is readily perceivable.&lt;ref name=Kuhn2011&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.09.013|pmid=20943415|title=Misdirected by the gap: The relationship between inattentional blindness and attentional misdirection|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=20|issue=2|pages=432–436|year=2011|last1=Kuhn|first1=Gustav|last2=Tatler|first2=Benjamin W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between inattentional blindness and misdirection involves how attention is manipulated. While inattentional blindness tasks require an explicit distractor, the attentional distraction in misdirection occurs through the implicit yet systematic orchestration of attention.&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011"/&gt; Moreover, there are several varieties of misdirection and different types are likely to induce different cognitive and perceptual processes, which vary the misdirection paradigm's resemblance to inattentional blindness.&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011"/&gt;

Although the aims of magic and illusion differ from those of neuroscience, magicians wish to exploit cognitive weaknesses, whereas neuroscientists seek to understand the brain and the neuronal significance of cognitive functions. Several researchers have argued that neuroscientists and psychologists can learn from incorporating the real world experience and knowledge of magicians into their fields of research. The techniques developed over centuries of stage magic by magicians may also be utilized by neuroscience as powerful probes of human cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martinez-Conde | first1 = S. | last2 = Macknik | first2 = S. L. | year = 2008 | title = Magic and the Brain | url = http://macknik.neuralcorrelate.com/pdf/articles/sciam08.pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = 299| issue = 6| pages = 72–79 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1208-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police shootings===
When a police officer's version of events differs from video or forensic evidence, inattentional blindness has been used by defense lawyers as a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.forcescience.org/fsnews/225.html |title = The invisible gorilla strikes again |year=2015 |publisher=Force Science Institute Ltd. |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism of this defense is that this view could be used to defend nearly any police shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Matt Apuzzo |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/us/training-officers-to-shoot-first-and-he-will-answer-questions-later |title=Training Officers to Shoot First, and He Will Answer Questions Later |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2 August 2015 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Ned Katz''' (born 1938) is an American [[historian]] of [[human sexuality]] who has focused on [[Homosexuality|same-sex]] attraction and changes in the social organization of sexuality over time. His works focus on the idea, rooted in [[social constructionism]], that the categories with which we describe and define human sexuality are historically and culturally specific, along with the social organization of sexual activity, desire, relationships, and sexual identities.&lt;ref&gt;The most complete list of Katz's works and life is available on OutHistory.org at: [http://www.outhistory.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ned_Katz:_1938-present Jonathan Ned Katz: 1938-present] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228232407/http://outhistory.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ned_Katz%3A_1938-present |date=2012-02-28 }}, accessed March 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Katz graduated from [[The High School of Music &amp; Art]] in [[New York City]] with a major in art in 1956. Since 2004, he has begun to emerge publicly as a visual artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathannedkatzart.com/JonathanNedKatzArt.com/Welcome.html |title=Jonathan Ned Katz Art |publisher=Jonathan Ned Katz Art |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to study at [[Antioch College]], the [[City College of New York]], [[The New School]], and [[Hunter College]]. As a teenager, Katz was featured in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine for his efforts to create a film version of ''[[Tom Sawyer]]''.&lt;ref name="Bubley"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.estherbubley.com/life_movie_frame_set.htm |title=Life Visits a Back-Yard Movie Set: Jonathan Katz, 13, Films 'Tom Sawyer' |last=Bubley |first=Esther |date=June 11, 1951 |work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |pages=140–143.}} Also see: https://books.google.com/books?id=c1EEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=Life+magazine%22+Jonathan+Katz%22#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Katz taught as an adjunct at [[Yale University]], [[Eugene Lang College]], and [[New York University]], was the convener of a faculty seminar at [[Princeton University]], and was a keynote speaker at [[Harvard University]]. He is a founding member of the [[Gay Academic Union]] in 1973 and the [[National Writers Union]] in 1980. He was the initiator and is the director of [[OutHistory|OutHistory.org]], a site devoted to [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], [[queer]], ([[LGBTQ]]) and heterosexual history, that went online in September 2008, and was produced in its first four years by the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies, an institute at the City University of New York Graduate Center, under a grant from the [[Arcus Foundation]]. Since 2012, the site has been co-directed by Katz and [[John D'Emilio]].

Katz received the [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] Medal for Outstanding Contributions to Sex Research from the [[German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research]] in 1997. In 2003, he was given  Yale University's [[Brudner Prize]], an annual honor recognizing scholarly contributions in the field of lesbian and gay studies. His papers are collected by the manuscript division of The Research Libraries of The [[New York Public Library]].

He received the [[Bill Whitehead Award]] for Lifetime Achievement from [[Publishing Triangle]] in 1995.

Katz artist practice focused on same-sex and different-sex relationships, and changes in the social construction of sexuality over time. His works stress that the social organization of human sexual activity, desire, relationships, and sexual identities are historically and culturally specific, along with the categories with which we name, describe, define and understand human sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/katzresume/introduction|title=Jonathan Ned Katz: Resumé · Jonathan Ned Katz Resumé : Independent Scholar, Historian, Visual Artist · outhistory.org|website=outhistory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Invention of Heterosexuality''==

''The Invention of Heterosexuality'' was first published as an essay in 1990 and then expanded into a larger book.  In it, Katz traces the development of ''heterosexual'' and ''homosexual'' and all the ideology, social and economic relations, gender expectations that were packed into it.  He notes the radical change, in the late nineteenth century, from a sexual ethic of procreation to one based on erotic pleasure and sexual object choice.  Noting the distinction that a procreation-based ethic condemns all non-procreative sex, categorizing sexual relations based primarily on this point.  A gender-based sexual ethic is concerned with procreative sex on a secondary level, if at all.

Katz follows the development of ''heterosexual'' as going through several stages.  Coined in 1868 (in German, ''Heterosexualität'') by [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]], the term, used to pathologize certain behaviors, initially referred to a person with an overwhelming drive toward the opposite sex and was associated with a number of pathologized behaviors.  In 1889, [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing]] used the term in something like its modern-day sense.  The first known use in America was in 1892, by [[James G. Kiernan]].  Here, it referred to some combination of bisexuality and a tendency to thwart the then-existing procreation ethic.

Krafft-Ebing's ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'', published in 1889, and then in English in 1892, marked the clear turning point from a procreation-based sexuality to a pleasure-based ethic which focused on gender to define the normal and the abnormal.  Krafft-Ebing did not, however, make a clean break from the old procreative standards.  In much of the discourse of the time, the heterosexual was still a deviant figure, since it signified a person unconcerned with the old sexual norms.

For a variety of economic and social reasons, Katz argues, during the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, this new norm became more firmly established and naturalized, marking out new gender and sexual norms, new social and family arrangements, and new deviants and perverts.  One of the important consequences of this line of thought which Katz notes in ''"Homosexual" and "Heterosexual": Questioning the Terms'', is that we can only generalize sexual identities onto the past with a limited degree of accuracy: "So profound is the historically specific character of sexual behavior that only with the loosest accuracy can we speak of sodomy in the early colonies and 'sodomy' in present-day New York as 'the same thing.'  In another example, to speak of 'heterosexual behavior' as occurring universally is to apply one term to a great variety of activities produced within a great variety of sexual and gender systems."

{{Nihongo|'''''Kanban'''''|看板}} ([[signboard]] or [[Billboard (advertising)|billboard]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) is a [[Scheduling (production processes)|scheduling]] system for [[lean manufacturing]] and [[just-in-time manufacturing]] (JIT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Kanban | title=Kanban | publisher=Dictionary.com | work=Random House Dictionary | year=2011 | accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taiichi Ohno]], an [[industrial engineer]] at [[Toyota]], developed kanban to improve manufacturing efficiency. Kanban is one method to achieve JIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Ohno |first = Taiichi |authorlink = Taiichi Ohno |title = Toyota Production System - beyond large-scale production  |publisher = Productivity Press |date = June 1988| pages = 29 |isbn = 0-915299-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system takes its name from the cards that track production within a factory. For many in the automotive sector, kanban is known as the "Toyota nameplate system" and as such the term is not used by some other automakers.

Kanban became an effective tool to support running a production system as a whole, and an excellent way to promote improvement. Problem areas are highlighted by measuring lead time and cycle time of the full process and process steps.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Shingō |first = Shigeo | authorlink = Shigeo Shingo |title = A Study of the Toyota Production System from an Industrial Engineering Viewpoint |publisher = Productivity Press |year = 1989| pages = 228 |isbn = 0-915299-17-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main benefits of kanban is to establish an upper limit to [[work in process]] inventory to avoid overcapacity. Other systems with similar effect are for example [[CONWIP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Hopp|first = Wallace J.|title = To Pull or Not to Pull: What Is the Question? |journal = Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management|date = Spring 2004| pages = 133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A systematic study of various configurations of kanban systems, of which CONWIP is an important special case, can be found in Tayur (1993), among other papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1287/mnsc.39.11.1347 | title = Structural Properties and a Heuristic for Kanban-Controlled Serial Lines | journal = Management Science| last = Tayur | first = Sridhar | year = 1993 | volume = 39 | number = 11 | pages = 1347–1368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/07408179508936726 | journal = IIE Transactions | last1=   Muckstadt | first1= John | last2=Tayur | first2=Sridhar|title =A comparison of alternative kanban control mechanisms.

A goal of the kanban system is to limit the buildup of excess inventory at any point in production. Limits on the number of items waiting at supply points are established and then reduced as inefficiencies are identified and removed. Whenever a limit is exceeded, this points to an inefficiency that should be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R.J. |last=Schonberger |year=2001 |title=Let's Fix It! Overcoming the Crisis in Manufacturing |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The system originates from the simplest visual stock replenishment signaling system, an empty box. This was first developed in the UK Spitfire factories during the war and was known as the “two bin system.” In the late 1940s, Toyota started studying [[supermarket]]s with the idea of applying shelf-stocking techniques to the factory floor. In a supermarket, customers generally retrieve what they need at the required time—no more, no less. Furthermore, the supermarket stocks only what it expects to sell in a given time, and customers take only what they need, because future supply is assured. This observation led Toyota to view a process as being a customer of one or more preceding processes and to view the preceding processes as a kind of store.

Kanban aligns inventory levels with actual consumption. A signal tells a supplier to produce and deliver a new shipment when a material is consumed. This [[Demand signal|signal]] is tracked through the replenishment cycle, bringing visibility to the supplier, consumer, and buyer.

Kanban uses the rate of demand to control the rate of production, passing demand from the end customer up through the chain of customer-store processes. In 1953, Toyota applied this logic in their main plant machine shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Ohno |first = Taiichi |authorlink = Taiichi Ohno |title = Toyota Production  - beyond large-scale production |publisher = Productivity Press |date = June 1988| pages = 25–28 |isbn = 0-915299-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
A key indicator of the success of production scheduling based on demand, ''pushing,'' is the ability of the [[demand forecasting|demand-forecast]] to create such a ''[[Push–pull strategy|push]]''. Kanban, by contrast, is part of an approach where the [[Push–pull strategy|''pull'']] comes from demand and products are [[Build to order|made to order]]. Re-supply or production is determined according to customer orders.

In contexts where supply time is lengthy and demand is difficult to forecast, often, the best one can do is to respond quickly to observed demand. This situation is exactly what a kanban system accomplishes, in that it is used as a demand signal that immediately travels through the supply chain. This ensures that intermediate stock held in the supply chain are better managed, and are usually smaller. Where the supply response is not quick enough to meet actual demand fluctuations, thereby causing potential lost sales, a stock building may be deemed more appropriate and is achieved by placing more kanban in the system.

Taiichi Ohno stated that to be effective, kanban must follow strict rules of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Shingō |first = Shigeo |authorlink = Shigeo Shingo |title = A Study of the Toyota Production System from an Industrial Engineering Viewpoint |publisher = Productivity Press |year = 1989| pages = 30 |isbn = 0-915299-17-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Toyota, for example, has six simple rules, and close monitoring of these rules is a never-ending task, thereby ensuring that the kanban does what is required.

===Toyota's Six Rules===
[[Toyota]] has formulated six rules for the application of kanban:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Ohno |first = Taiichi |authorlink = Taiichi Ohno |title = Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production |publisher = Productivity Press |year = 1988| pages = 176|isbn = 9780915299140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Each process issues requests (kanban) to its suppliers as it consumes its supplies.
# Each process produces according to the quantity and sequence of incoming requests.
# No items are made or transported without a request.
# The request associated with an item is always attached to it.
# Processes must not send out defective items, to ensure that finished products will be defect-free.
# Limiting the number of pending requests makes the process more sensitive and reveals inefficiencies.

===Kanban (cards)===
Kanban cards are a key component of kanban and they signal the need to move materials within a production facility or to move materials from an outside supplier into the production facility. The kanban card is, in effect, a message that signals a depletion of product, parts, or inventory. When received, the kanban triggers replenishment of that product, part, or inventory.  Consumption, therefore, drives demand for more production, and the kanban card signals demand for more product—so kanban cards help create a demand-driven system.

It is widely held{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} by proponents of [[lean production]] and manufacturing that demand-driven systems lead to faster turnarounds in production and lower inventory levels, helping companies implementing such systems be more competitive.

In the last few years, systems sending kanban signals electronically have become more widespread. While this trend is leading to a reduction in the use of kanban cards in aggregate, it is still common in modern lean production facilities to find the use of kanban cards.  In various software systems, kanban is used for signalling demand to suppliers through email notifications.  When stock of a particular component is depleted by the quantity assigned on kanban card, a "kanban trigger" is created (which may be manual or automatic), a purchase order is released with predefined quantity for the supplier defined on the card, and the supplier is expected to dispatch material within a specified lead-time.&lt;ref name=JDEdwards&gt;{{cite book|title=JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Kanban Management 9.0 Implementation Guide|publisher=[[JD Edwards]]|chapter-url=http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E15156_01/e1apps90pbr0/eng/psbooks/1akm/chapter.htm?File=1akm/htm/1akm04.htm|accessdate=26 February 2015|chapter=Setting Up Kanban Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanban cards, in keeping with the principles of kanban, simply convey the need for more materials. A red card lying in an empty parts cart conveys that more parts are needed.

===Three-bin system===
An example of a simple kanban system implementation is a "three-bin system" for the supplied parts, where there is no in-house manufacturing. One bin is on the factory floor (the initial demand point), one bin is in the factory store (the inventory control point), and one bin is at the supplier. The bins usually have a removable card containing the product details and other relevant information—the classic kanban card.

When the bin on the factory floor is empty (because the parts in it were used up in a manufacturing process), the empty bin and its kanban card are returned to the factory store (the inventory control point). The factory store replaces the empty bin on the factory floor with the full bin from the factory store, which also contains a kanban card. The factory store sends the empty bin with its kanban card to the supplier. The supplier's full product bin, with its kanban card, is delivered to the factory store; the supplier keeps the empty bin.  This is the final step in the process.  Thus, the process never runs out of product—and could be described as a closed loop, in that it provides the exact amount required, with only one spare bin so there is never oversupply. This 'spare' bin allows for uncertainties in supply, use, and transport in the inventory system. A good kanban system calculates just enough kanban cards for each product. Most factories that use kanban use the coloured board system ([[heijunka box]]).

==Electronic kanban==
Many manufacturers have implemented '''electronic kanban''' (sometimes referred to as E-kanban&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.li/sxld3#selection-335.0-280.1|work=Momentum, the midsize business center newsletter |title=Taking control of costs |publisher=Microsoft}}{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vernyi |first=Bruce |author2=Vinas, Tonya |title=Easing into E-Kanban |date=December 1, 2005 |accessdate=April 12, 2008 |journal=IndustryWeek |url=http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=11009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316091741/http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=11009 |archivedate=March 16, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These help to eliminate common problems such as manual entry errors and lost cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drickhamer |first=David |date=March 2005 |title=The Kanban E-volution |journal=Material Handling Management |pages=24–26 |url=http://www.mhmonline.com/viewStory.asp?nID=3950&amp;S=1 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; E-kanban systems can be integrated into [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems, enabling real-time demand signaling across the supply chain and improved visibility. Data pulled from E-kanban systems can be used to optimize inventory levels by better tracking supplier lead and replenishment times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cutler |first=Thomas R. |title=Examining Lean Manufacturing Promise |date=September 2006 |accessdate=January 29, 2013 |journal=SoftwareMag.com |url=http://www.softwaremag.com/content/ContentCT.asp?P=3193 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526100928/http://www.softwaremag.com/content/ContentCT.asp?P=3193 |archivedate=May 26, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-kanban is a signaling system that uses a mix of technology to trigger the movement of materials within a manufacturing or production facility.  Electronic Kanban differs from traditional kanban in that it uses technology to replace traditional elements such as kanban cards with [[barcode]]s and electronic messages such as [[email]] or [[Electronic data interchange]].

A typical electronic kanban system marks inventory with barcodes, which workers scan at various stages of the manufacturing process to signal usage. The scans relay messages to internal/external stores to ensure the restocking of products. Electronic kanban often uses the internet as a method of routing messages to external suppliers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Manufacturing Strategies: Context, Content and Change |editor-first2=Christopher A. |editor-last2=Voss |editor-first3=Kathryn L. |editor-last3=Blackmon |editor-first1=Per |editor-last1=Lindberg |isbn=0-7923-8061-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a means to allow a real-time view of inventory, via a portal, throughout the supply chain.

Organizations such as the [[Ford Motor Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Visual Tools: Collected Practices and Cases |publisher=Productivity Press |isbn=1-56327-331-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bombardier Aerospace]] have used electronic kanban systems to improve processes. Systems are now widespread from single solutions or bolt on modules to [[ERP system]]s.

==Types of kanban systems==
In a kanban system, adjacent upstream and downstream workstations communicate with each other through their cards, where each container has a kanban associated with it. Economic Order Quantity is important. The
two most important types of kanbans are:
* Production (P) Kanban: A P-kanban, when received, authorizes the workstation to produce a fixed amount of products. The P-kanban is carried on the containers that are associated with it.
* Transportation (T) Kanban: A T-kanban authorizes the transportation of the full container to the downstream workstation. The T-kanban is also carried on the containers that are associated with the transportation to move through the loop again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7244">{{chaos magic}}Within the [[magic_(paranormal)|magical system]] of [[Austin Osman Spare]], ''Kia'' is a mystical concept – a sort of [[Brahman|universal consciousness]] or unity, similar to the [[Tao]].&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been adopted by numerous other occultists, such as [[Kenneth Grant]], and has been particularly influential on the [[chaos magic]] movement.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

[[Phil Baker (writer)|Phil Baker]] has speculated that the word "Kia" may have been influenced by "esoteric Eastern and cabalistic words" such as [[Qi|''ki'', ''chi'']], [[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|''khya'' and ''chiah'']]. Or, alternatively, it may have been taken from ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' by [[Madame Blavatsky]], which refers to a universal power called "Kia-yu".&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==

The first reference to "Kia" appears on a painting exhibited by Spare in 1904, when he was just 17 years old.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Spare conceived of Kia as a sort of [[universal mind]], of which individual human consciousnesses are aspects.&lt;ref name=Spare1&gt;[[#refSpare1|Spare, Austin Osman. ''The Book of Pleasure'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Spare further elaborated on the concept in ''The Book of Pleasure'' (1913), introducing it with the words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Of name it has no name, to designate. I call it Kia I dare not claim it as myself. The Kia which can be expressed by conceivable ideas, is not the eternal Kia, which burns up all belief but is the archetype of "self," the slavery of mortality.&lt;ref name=Spare1&gt;[[#refSpare1|Spare, Austin Osman. ''The Book of Pleasure'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Spare's words here bear marked resemblance to the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', which states "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao; The name that can be named is not the eternal name."&lt;ref name=Tao&gt;[[#refTao|Lao Tzu. ''Tao Te Ching'']]&lt;/ref&gt; – and like the Tao, or the [[Hindu]] [[Brahman]], or the [[Sunyata]] of [[Buddhism]], Spare's conception of Kia combined pure transcendent consciousness with a voidness inherent in all things.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer and occultist [[Kenneth Grant]], who had known Spare in the 1950s,&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt; promoted Spare's ideas after his death, referring to his system as "Zos Kia Cultus".&lt;ref name=Grant1&gt;[[#refGrant1|Grant, Kenneth. ''Cults of the Shadow'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Grant emphasises the similarities between Kia and certain concepts from Eastern philosophy, comparing it to the [[Yab-Yum]] of [[Tantra]], and describing reality as the dream of Kia.&lt;ref name=Grant2&gt;[[#refGrant2|Grant, Kenneth. ''Hidden Lore: The Carfax Monograms'']]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Grant also states that Kia differs from the Buddhist concept of voidness, in that it is realised through the body, rather than the mind, stating: "The Kia is present everywhere, but the immediacy of its realisation is sought through the flesh, as in Zen it is apprehended through the mind. The object is the same in both methods, but the means appear to vary."&lt;ref name=Grant2&gt;[[#refGrant2|Grant, Kenneth. ''Hidden Lore: The Carfax Monograms'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant also departs from Spare in conceptualising Kia as inherently ''feminine'', equating it with both the [[Wicca|Wiccan]] [[Triple_Goddess_(Neopaganism)|Goddess]]&lt;ref name=Grant2&gt;[[#refGrant2|Grant, Kenneth. ''Hidden Lore: The Carfax Monograms'']]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aleister Crowley|Aleister Crowley's]] [[Babalon]]&lt;ref name=Grant3&gt;[[#refGrant3|Grant, Kenneth. ''The Magical Revival'']]&lt;/ref&gt; – the basic idea being that Kia is a sort of all-encompassing void that is impregnated by the will of the magician, and that gives birth to magical results.&lt;ref name=Grant3&gt;[[#refGrant3|Grant, Kenneth. ''The Magical Revival'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter J. Carroll]], one of the founders of [[chaos magic]] (along with [[Ray Sherwin]]), elaborated a system heavily influenced by Spare in his early writings, particularly ''Liber Null'' (1978).&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt; However, somewhat confusingly, Carroll uses the term "Kia" to refer to the consciousness of the individual: "the elusive 'I' which confers self-awareness".&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt; The more general universal force, of which Kia is an aspect, Carroll termed "Chaos".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The unity which appears to the mind to exert the twin functions of will and perception is called ''Kia'' by magicians. Sometimes it is called the spirit, or soul, or life force, instead... Kia is capable of occult power because it is a fragment of the great life force of the universe... The "thing" responsible for the origin and continued action of events is called ''Chaos'' by magicians... Chaos... is the force which has caused life to evolve itself out of dust, and is currently most concentratedly manifest in the human life force, or Kia, where it is the source of consciousness... To the extent that the Kia can become one with Chaos it can extend its will and perception into the universe to accomplish magic.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Marc Bogaerts'''  is a Belgian [[choreographer]] and [[artistic director]] living in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/90072526.html?dids=90072526:90072526&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+04%2C+1990&amp;author=Diane+Hubbard+Burns+Sentinel+Dance+Critic&amp;pub=Orlando+Sentinel&amp;desc=MARC+BOGAERTS+TOUCHES+THE+HEART+AS+A+CHOREOGRAPHER+OF+CONSCIENCE&amp;pqatl=google|title=Marc Bogaerts touches the heart as a choreographer of conscience|last=Burns|first=Diane Hubbard|date=4 February 1990|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|page=F1|accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked internationally for over more than 50 dance, opera and circus companies.
Bogaerts stipulates that our current generational dynamic is complex and routed in the mundane and monotonous rigors of our daily need to survive or surpass. Therefore, he believes in the need to counterbalance routine by symmetrically presenting traditionally segregated styles such as [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[contemporary circus|nouveau circus]] and stationary art.
Following postmodernism, Marc Bogaerts builds a bridge between all forms of physical expression. Making unconventional combinations ([[modern dance]]rs with [[Sportsperson|athlete]]s, [[circus|circus artists]] with [[ballroom dance]]rs, [[ice skating|ice skaters]] with snake women, [[breakdance]]rs with [[ballet|classical dancers]]) and bringing in his productions [[sport]], [[art]], [[ecology]]/[[innovations]] together he creates unusual [[symbiosis]].

== Biography ==

He studied 7 years Latin, Greek and philosophy with the [[Jesuits]], which influenced his later work by integrated understanding of all sports, the unity of body and soul, as it was formulated by the [[ancient Greek]]s. In 1975 he started his career as a dancer and soon also as a choreographer with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080607155512/http://www.kbvv.be/Site/rbf.htm Royal Ballet of Flanders]. From 1982 to 1993 he resided in [[New York City]], where he danced as an honorary guest performer with [[Merce Cunningham]], [[Trisha Brown]] and [[Laura Dean (choreographer)|Laura Dean]], taught at the [[Actors Studio]] in New York and initiated numerous artistic social projects raising awareness about [[abortion]], [[drugs]] and [[genocide]]. From New York he moved to [[Berlin]]. As the only choreographer working for all three opera houses in Berlin: [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], [[Staatsoper Unter den Linden]], [[Komische Oper Berlin]] he created performances such as ''Carmina Burana'', ''L’Histoire du Soldat'' or ''Four Seasons''. He created a lot of social-cultural works worldwide with major involvement of youth. E.g. USA "Missing Persons"  on human rights, or issues on abortion, drugabuse, terrorism each time touching the nerf of times without insulting or scandalizing, which for him is the easy way out. Living all around the world he finds inspiration for his interdisciplinary productions. At the moment creating a synthesis of sport and stage art is in the centre of his artistic work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2117">'''McGuire’s Psychological Motivations''' is a classification system that organizes theories of motives into 16 categories.  The system helps [[marketer]]s to isolate motives likely to be involved in various [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] situations.

==Categories==

McGuire first divided the motivation into two main categories using two criteria:
# Is the mode of motivation [[cognitive]] or [[affective]]?
# Is the motive focused on preservation of the [[status quo]] or on growth?

Then for each division in each category he stated there is two more basic elements.
# Is this behavior actively initiated or in response to the [[Social environment|environment]]?
# Does this behavior help the individual achieve a new internal or a new external [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] to the environment?

==Divisions of categories==

#Cognitive Preservation Motives
#:a. Need for [[Consistency]] (active, internal)
#: b. Need for Attribution (active, external)
#: c. Need to categorize (passive, internal)
#: d. Need for [[objectification]] (passive, external)
#Cognitive Growth Motives
#: a. Need for [[Autonomy]] (active, internal)
#: b. Need for [[Stimulation]] (active, external)
#: c. Teleological Need (passive, internal)
#: d. Utilitarian Need (passive, external)
#Affective Preservation Motives
#: a. Need for Tension Reduction 
#: b. Need for Expression (active, external)

'''''Metallum Martis''''', a 1665 [[book]] by [[Dud Dudley]], is the earliest known reference to the use of [[coal]] in [[metallurgical]] [[smelting]]. The book is also referred to as ''Iron made with Pit-Coale, Sea-Coale, &amp;c. And with the same Fuell to Melt and Fine Imperfect Mettals, And Refine perfect Mettals.''

Many attendant difficulties had to be overcome before this [[fuel]] could be applied to the purpose of [[smelting]] [[iron]]. Dudley does not describe in his book how he was using coal, only that he was. In so doing, he described his use successively of an ironworks on [[Pensnett Chase]] and at [[Cradley, West Midlands|Cradley]], of a furnace at [[Himley Hall|Himley]], and of a furnace at Hasco Bridge near [[Gornal, West Midlands|Gornal]].

Dudley does mention several things that indicate what he was doing. The coal he used was the small pieces and slack which were "little or of no use in that inland country" and so brought in no money. This coal debris was left in heaps and "crowded moist slack heat naturally, and kindle in the middle of these great heaps, often sets the coal works on fire" and that "Also from these sulphurous heaps, mixed with ironstone (for out of many of the same pits is gotten much ironstone or mine), the fires heating vast quantities of water, passing through these soughs or adits becometh as hot as the bath at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]".&lt;ref&gt;Scrivenor quoting Dudley, {{harv|Scrivenor|1854|p=40,41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dudley describes two rival attempts to smelt iron with coal instigated by supporters of Parliament during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]]. Dudley visited both sites and having examined their furnaces and production methods, when asked his opinion, informed the proprietors that they would fail. The first attempt was by Captain Buck, with the backing of many parliamentary officers including Oliver Cromwell, with technical help from Edward Dagney, an Italian. In the second attempt in the late 1656–67 by Captain John Copley also failed despite Dudley, at no charge, improving the efficiency of Copley's bellows. Dudley reapplied for a patent from Charles II, in 1660 stating "and seeing no man able to perform the mastery of making of iron with pit-coal or sea-coal, ... [without my] laudable inventions the author was, and is, unwilling [that they] should fall to the ground and die with him".&lt;ref&gt;Scrivenor quoting Dudley, {{harv|Scrivenor|1854|pp=45–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A significant feature of his great work ''Metallum Martis'' is a map showing [[Dudley Castle]] where he correctly identifies the order and geographic layout of [[stratum|strata]] of coal and [[ironstone]] under survey.

Considered to be the earliest of recorded [[geologic map]]s, ''Metallum Martis'' marks a turning point in the evolution of scientific rationale concerning the recording and interpretation of [[geology|geological]] information. It is considered to have been made at Castle Hill in Dudley by Dud Dudley in 1665.

'''Miranda Devine''' (born 1960s&lt;ref name = "born"/&gt;) is an Australian columnist and writer noted for her conservative stance on a range of social and political issues. Her [[column (newspaper)|column]], formerly printed twice weekly in [[Fairfax Media]] newspapers ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Sun-Herald]]'', now appears in the News Limited newspapers ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', Melbourne's ''[[Sunday Herald Sun]]'' and Perth's ''[[Sunday Times]]''. She hosted ''The Miranda Devine Show'', a weekly syndicated radio show on Sydney station [[2GB]].

==Life and career==
Devine is the daughter of journalist [[Frank Devine]]. She and her two younger sisters spent considerable parts of their youth overseas while their father was working as a foreign correspondent for Australian newspapers and, later, edited various American newspapers. While living in Tokyo, Devine attended an American [[International School]] and learned to speak Japanese fluently.&lt;ref name="BulletinBagnall"/&gt; A devout [[Roman Catholic]], she completed her high school education at [[Loreto Kirribilli]], a Catholic girls' private school in Sydney. After school, she completed a BSc in mathematics at [[Macquarie University]].&lt;ref&gt;The Australian, 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She joined the [[CSIRO]] in their textile physics division, where she worked for four years.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  She then completed a one-year graduate program at the Medill School of Journalism,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/msj/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} 

On 6 August 2010, ''The Daily Telegraph'' announced that Devine would be returning as a columnist for both ''The Daily Telegraph'' and ''Sunday Telegraph''.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt;

She describes herself as "a Catholic and a mother".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/too-many-enemies-are-basking-in-george-pells-situation/news-story/7cb21419b9031dfb9d16a53797329944 Too many enemies are basking in George Pell’s situation], ''Daily Telegraph'', 2 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==
=== White genocide ===
Devine has been accused by media of promoting the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]] and described as pivotal in popularising the concept within Australian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2018/mar/22/white-australians-debate-fast-track-visas-afrikane/ |title=White Australians debate fast-track visas for Afrikaners fleeing land reform |date=22 March 2018 |publisher=''[[New York Amsterdam News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-03-22-aussie-minister-dutton-the-next-prime-minister-or-the-great-divider |title=Aussie Minister Dutton the next prime minister, or the great divider? |date=22 March 2018 |publisher=''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite news |url=

== Commentary and controversy ==
Devine is a friend of fellow conservative columnist [[Tim Blair]], who said of her, "She's got good antennae. She can read people which is why she accurately predicts election results".&lt;ref name="BulletinBagnall"/&gt; When interviewed for an April 2007 article in ''[[The Australian]]'' about [[hate mail]] received by female columnists, Devine commented, "You are contesting ideas and you have to do it in a [[Polarization (politics)|polarising]] way. When you write a column, you can't sit on the fence".&lt;ref name="HateMail"/&gt;

In their book ''[[Silencing Dissent]]'' ([[Allen &amp; Unwin]]), [[Clive Hamilton]] and [[Sarah Maddison]] accuse Devine of belonging to a "syndicate of right-wing commentators who receive favour from the [[John Howard|Howard]] Government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21144760-7583,00.html "How a right-wing, pro-Howard cabal is stifling debate"], an excerpt from ''[[Silencing Dissent]]'', printed in ''[[The Australian]]'' on 31 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Devine used the news of Australian federal government minister [[Penny Wong]]'s decision to parent a child with her female partner as the basis of a column in which she argued that the [[2011 England riots|2011 riots in England]] were the result of a "fatherless society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Devine |first=Miranda |title=The Problems of a Fatherless Society |url=http://blogs.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/mirandadevine/index.php/dailytelegraph/comments/its_a_myth_conception |accessdate=14 August 2011 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Deveny |first=Catherine |authorlink=Catherine Deveny |date=17 August 2011 |title=Why equal rights activists need Miranda Devine more than rallies |work=The Drum |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/2842140.html |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Devine sparked considerable controversy after claiming that "women abusing welfare" were the main cause of [[domestic violence]]. According to Devine, "If you want to break the cycle of violence, end the welfare incentive for unsuitable women to keep having children to a string of feckless men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jenny |last=Noyes |url=http://www.dailylife.com.au/dl-people/miranda-devine-column-prompts-domestic-violence-survivors-to-share-unsuitablewomen-stories-20150928-gjw8ua.html |title=Miranda Devine column prompts domestic violence survivors to share #UnsuitableWomen stories |newspaper=The Vine |date=28 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, she wrote that share bicycle schemes were a terror threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/city-share-bikes-are-a-terrorists-best-friend/news-story/e193af2dd3b08458e2a4ba8442a847e9 City share bikes are a terrorist’s best friend], [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]], 28 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Devine advocated for the continuation of [[Fossil fuel power station#Coal|coal-fired electricity]] options; she has repeatedly [[Climate change denial|suggested]] that [[climate change]] is a political conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/...a.../b7eda462757d6e9ed4e91c8e6541b98b Smart meters energy crisis not reducing bills or...], [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]], 7 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9444">{{Tort law}}
The [[tort]] of '''negligent infliction of emotional distress''' ('''NIED''') is a controversial [[cause of action]], which is available in nearly all [[U.S. state]]s but is severely constrained and limited in the majority of them.  The underlying concept is that one has a [[Duty of care|legal duty]] to use reasonable care to avoid causing [[emotion]]al [[stress (medicine)|distress]] to another individual.  If one fails in this duty and unreasonably causes emotional distress to another person, that actor will be [[Legal liability|liable]] for monetary [[damages]] to the injured individual.  The tort is to be contrasted with [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] in that there is no need to prove intent to inflict distress.  That is, an accidental infliction, if negligent, is sufficient to support a cause of action.

==History==

NIED began to develop in the late nineteenth century, but only in a very limited form, in the sense that plaintiffs could recover for consequential emotional distress as a component of damages when a defendant negligently inflicted physical harm upon them.  By 1908, most industrial U.S. states had adopted the "physical impact" form of NIED.  However, NIED started developing into its more mature and more controversial form in the mid-20th century, as the new machines of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] flooded the legal system with all kinds of previously unimaginable complex factual scenarios.  Courts began to allow plaintiffs to recover for emotional distress resulting from negligent physical injuries to not only themselves, but other persons with whom they had a special relationship, like a relative.  The first step, then, was to remove the requirement of physical injury to the actual plaintiff while keeping the requirement of physical injury to ''someone.''  In the 1968 landmark decision of ''[[Dillon v. Legg]]'', the [[Supreme Court of California]] was the first court to allow recovery for emotional distress alone{{spaced ndash}}even in the absence of any physical injury to the plaintiff{{spaced ndash}}in the particular situation where the plaintiff simply witnessed the death of a close relative at a distance, and was not within the "zone of danger" where the relative was killed.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Dillon v. Legg]]'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/68C2d728.htm 68 Cal. 2d 728] (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2007 statistical study commissioned by the Court found that ''Dillon'' was the most persuasive decision published by the Court between 1940 and 2005; ''Dillon'' has been favorably cited and followed by at least twenty reported out-of-state appellate decisions, more than any other California appellate decision.&lt;ref&gt;Jake Dear and Edward W. Jessen, ''" Followed Rates" and Leading State Cases, 1940-2005'', &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;[http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/41/2/essay/DavisVol41No2_Dear.pdf 41 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 683, 694]&lt;/span&gt;(2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step after ''Dillon'' was to make optional the element of another person (so that the injury could be to ''anything'' where it would be reasonably foreseeable that such injury would cause some person emotional distress). The first such case was ''Rodrigues v. State'',&lt;ref&gt;52 Haw. 156, 472 P.2d 509 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]] held that plaintiffs could recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress as a result of negligently caused flood damage to their home.  This is generally considered to be the true birth of NIED as a separate tort.

Twelve years after ''Dillon'', [[California]] expanded NIED again, by holding that a relative could recover even where the underlying physical injury was ''[[de minimis]]'' (unnecessary medications and medical tests) if the outcome was foreseeable (the breakup of the plaintiffs' marriage as a result of the defendants' negligent and incorrect diagnosis of a [[sexually transmitted disease]]).&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Molien v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals]]'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/27C3d916.htm 27 Cal. 3d 916] (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court for the first time recognized NIED as part of federal common law, by holding that railroad workers could pursue NIED claims against their employers under the [[Federal Employers Liability Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Gottshall'', {{ussc|512|532|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court recognized only the pre-''Dillon'' form of NIED, though, in that the plaintiff had to be within a zone of danger to recover in the absence of physical injury.  

In 1999, [[Hawaii]] took NIED even further by expressly holding that "damages may be based solely upon serious emotional distress, even absent proof of a predicate physical injury."&lt;ref&gt;''Roes v. FHP, Inc.'', [http://www.state.hi.us/jud/21504.htm 91 Haw. 470, 985 P.2d 661] (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

It is generally disfavored by most states because it appears to have no definable parameters and because so many potential claims can be made under it. The situations that would give rise to such a claim are difficult to define. Because of this substantial uncertainty, most legal theorists find the theory to be unworkable in practice. 

A corollary of this critique is that the tort runs the risk (in the bystander NIED context) of overcompensating plaintiffs for distress which would have occurred anyway ''regardless'' of the cause of death of the decedent. In a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of California, which severely limited the availability of bystander NIED, Associate Justice [[David Eagleson]] wrote in ''[[Thing v. La Chusa]]'', 48 Cal. 3d 644 (1989): 

{{cquote|No policy supports extension of the right to recover for NIED to a larger class of plaintiffs. Emotional distress is an intangible condition experienced by most persons, even absent negligence, at some time during their lives. Close relatives suffer serious, even debilitating, emotional reactions to the injury, death, serious illness, and evident suffering of loved ones. These reactions occur regardless of the cause of the loved one's illness, injury, or death. That relatives will have severe emotional distress is an unavoidable aspect of the 'human condition.' The emotional distress for which monetary damages may be recovered, however, ought not to be that form of acute emotional distress or the transient emotional reaction to the occasional gruesome or horrible incident to which every person may potentially be exposed in an industrial and sometimes violent society. . . . The overwhelming majority of 'emotional distress' which we endure, therefore, is not compensable.&lt;ref&gt;''Thing v. La Chusa'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C3/48C3d644.htm 48 Cal. 3d 644, 666-667] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An additional criticism of the tort is that it leads to abuse of [[liability insurance]] coverage. Most liability insurance [[insurance policy|policies]] provide for coverage of negligently inflicted [[injury|injuries]] but exclude coverage of [[intentional tort|intentionally inflicted injuries]]. If a victim is intentionally injured by a person, many theorists perceive that the victim will tend to recast the claim as being one for [[negligence]] in order to fall within the coverage of the insurance policy.

The [[Texas]] case of ''[[Boyles v. Kerr]]'', 855 S.W.2d 593 (Tex. 1993) is illustrative. In this case, the [[defendant]] secretly [[videotape]]d himself engaging in [[Human sexuality|sexual]] activities with the [[plaintiff]]. The defendant then showed this videotape to numerous individuals and caused severe distress to the plaintiff. The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant, asserting a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

On appeal, the [[Supreme Court of Texas]] observed that the facts did not support a claim of negligence. Rather, the Court noted, the facts clearly supported a claim of an intentional injury by the defendant and it was evident that the claim had been cast as "negligence" solely to obtain insurance coverage. The Court then went on to hold that Texas did not recognize a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress and [[wikt:remand|remanded]] the case to the trial court for consideration of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. 

Jurisdictions that have rejected the claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress do not forbid the recovery of damages for [[mental injury|mental injuries]].  Instead, these jurisdictions usually allow recovery for emotional distress where such distress:
# is inflicted [[intention]]ally (i.e., intentional infliction of emotional distress)
# is directly associated with a [[Trauma (medicine)|physical injury]] negligently inflicted upon a victim (e.g., emotional distress resulting from a loss of limb or disfigurement of the face)
# is caused by [[Defamation|defamation and libel]];
# stems from witnessing a [[wikt:gruesome|gruesome]] accident as a bystander
# is the product of some misconduct universally recognized as causing emotional distress such as mishandling a loved one’s [[Cadaver|corpse]] or failing to deliver a death notice in a timely manner.

The [[Miller–Urey experiment]] in 1952, and others since, demonstrated the synthesis of [[organic compounds]], such as [[amino acids]], [[formaldehyde]] and [[sugars]], from the original [[inorganic]] precursors the researchers presumed to have been present in the [[primordial soup]] (but is no longer considered likely). This experiment inspired many others. In 1961, [[Joan Oró]] found that the [[nucleotide]] base [[adenine]] could be made from [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) and [[ammonia]] in a water solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oró J, Kimball AP |title=Synthesis of purines under possible primitive earth conditions. I. Adenine from hydrogen cyanide |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |volume=94|pages=217–27 |date=August 1961 |pmid=13731263 |doi=10.1016/0003-9861(61)90033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments conducted later showed that the other [[Nucleobase|RNA and DNA nucleobases]] could be obtained through simulated prebiotic chemistry with a [[reducing atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Origins of Prebiological Systems and of Their Molecular Matrices| editor= Fox SW| author=Oró J| year=1967| pages=137| publisher=New York Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[RNA world hypothesis]] shows how RNA can become its own [[catalyst]] (a [[ribozyme]]). In between there are some missing steps such as how the first [[RNA]] molecules could be formed. The PAH world hypothesis was proposed by Simon Nicholas Platts in May 2004 to try to fill in this missing step.&lt;ref name=astro/&gt;  A more thoroughly elaborated idea has been published by [[Pascale Ehrenfreund|Ehrenfreund]] ''et al.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ehrenfreund | first1 = P | last2 = Rasmussen | first2 = S | last3 = Cleaves | first3 = J | last4 = Chen | first4 = L | year = 2006 | title = Experimentally tracing the key steps in the origin of life: The aromatic world | url = | journal = Astrobiology | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 490–520 | doi=10.1089/ast.2006.6.490 | bibcode=2006AsBio...6..490E | pmid=16805704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are the most common and abundant of the known polyatomic molecules in the visible [[universe]], and are considered a likely constituent of the [[primordial sea]].&lt;ref name="SP-20051018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJ-20051010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20110413" /&gt; PAHs, along with [[fullerenes]] (or "[[Buckyball (molecule)|buckyballs]]"), have been recently detected in nebulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/724/1/L39 |title=Formation Of Fullerenes In H-Containing Planetary Nebulae |last1=García-Hernández |first1=D.

On June 6, 2013, scientists at the [[Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía|IAA-CSIC]] reported the detection of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] in the [[upper atmosphere]] of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest [[Natural satellite|moon]] of the [[planet]] [[Saturn]].&lt;ref name="IAA-20130606"&gt;{{cite news |last=López-Puertas |first=Manuel |url=http://www.iaa.es/content/pahs-titans-upper-atmosphere |title=PAH's in Titan's Upper Atmosphere |date=June 6, 2013 |work=[[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] |accessdate=June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, researchers reported low-temperature chemical pathways from simple [[organic compound]]s to complex PAHs. Such chemical pathways may help explain the presence of PAHs in the low-temperature atmosphere of [[Saturn]]{{'s}} moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and may be significant pathways, in terms of the PAH world hypothesis, in producing presursors to biochemcals related to life as we know it.&lt;ref name="DG-20181008"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=“A Prebiotic Earth” – Missing Link Found on Saturn’s Moon Titan |url=https://dailygalaxy.com/2018/10/a-prebiotic-earth-missing-link-found-on-saturns-moon-titan/ |date=11 October 2018 |work=DailyGalaxy.com |accessdate=11 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NA-20181008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhao, Long et al. |title=Low-temperature formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Titan’s atmosphere |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-018-0585-y |date=8 October 2018 |journal=[[Nature Astronomy]] |accessdate=11 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, PAHs are not normally very soluble in sea water, but when subject to ionizing radiation such as solar [[UV]] light, the outer [[hydrogen]] atoms can be stripped off and replaced with a [[hydroxyl]] group, rendering the PAHs far more soluble in water.

These modified PAHs are [[amphiphilic]], which means that they have parts that are both [[hydrophilic]] and [[hydrophobic]]. When in solution, they assemble in [[Columnar phase|discotic]] [[mesogen]]ic ([[liquid crystal]]) stacks which, like [[lipids]], tend to organize with their hydrophobic parts protected.

On February 21, 2014, [[NASA]] announced a [http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/ greatly upgraded database]&lt;ref name="NASA-20140221"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoover |first=Rachel |title=Need to Track Organic Nano-Particles Across the Universe?

==Attachment of nucleobases to PAH scaffolding==
In the self-ordering PAH stack, the separation between adjacent rings is 0.34&amp;nbsp;nm.  This is the same separation found between adjacent [[nucleotide]]s of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]]. Smaller molecules will naturally attach themselves to the PAH rings. However PAH rings, while forming, tend to swivel around on one another, which will tend to dislodge attached compounds that would collide with those attached to those above and below. Therefore, it encourages preferential attachment of flat molecules such as [[pyrimidine]] and [[purine]] [[nucleobases]], the key constituents (and information carriers) of RNA and DNA. These bases are similarly amphiphilic and so also tend to line up in similar stacks.

==Attachment of oligomeric backbone==
According to the hypothesis, once the nucleobases are attached (via [[hydrogen bonds]]) to the PAH scaffolding, the inter-base distance would select for "linker" molecules of a specific size, such as small [[formaldehyde]] ([[methanal]]) [[oligomer]]s, also taken from the prebiotic "soup", which will bind (via [[covalent bonds]]) to the nucleobases as well as each other to add a flexible structural backbone.&lt;ref name=snp1&gt;Platts, Simon Nicholas, [http://www.pahworld.com/ "The PAH World - Discotic polynuclear aromatic compounds as a mesophase scaffolding at the origin of life"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=astro&gt;[http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/library-of-resources/annual-reports/2005/ciw/projects/project-4-prebiotic-molecular-selection-and-organization "Prebiotic Molecular Selection and Organization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524050536/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/library-of-resources/annual-reports/2005/ciw/projects/project-4-prebiotic-molecular-selection-and-organization/ |date=2009-05-24 }}, NASA's Astrobiology website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detachment of the RNA-like strands==
A subsequent transient drop in the ambient [[pH]] (increase in acidity), for example as a result of a [[Volcano|volcanic]] discharge of acidic gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]] or [[carbon dioxide]], would allow the bases to break off from their PAH scaffolding, forming RNA-like molecules (with the formaldehyde backbone instead of the ribose-phosphate backbone used by "modern" RNA, but the same 0.34&amp;nbsp;nm pitch).&lt;ref name=snp1/&gt;

==Formation of ribozyme-like structures==
The hypothesis further speculates that once long RNA-like single strands are detached from the PAH stacks, and after ambient pH levels became less acidic, they would tend to fold back on themselves, with [[Base pair|complementary sequences]] of nucleobases preferentially seeking out each other and forming [[hydrogen bonds]], creating stable, at least partially double-stranded RNA-like structures, similar to [[ribozymes]]. The formaldehyde oligomers would eventually be replaced with more stable ribose-phosphate molecules for the backbone material, resulting in a starting milestone for the [[RNA world hypothesis]], which speculates about further evolutionary developments from that point.&lt;ref name=snp1/&gt;&lt;ref name=astro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''[[Abuse]] of parents by their children''', also known as child-to-parent violence (CPV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Child to Parent Violence Services |url=https://www.pac-uk.org/cpv/ |website=PAC-UK |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[domestic violence]], and is one of the most under-reported and under-researched subject areas in the field of [[psychology]]. Parents are quite often subject to levels of [[childhood aggression]] in excess of normal childhood aggressive outbursts, typically in the form of [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse|physical]] abuse. Parents feel a sense of [[shame]] and [[humiliation]] to have that problem, so they rarely seek help and there is usually little or no help available anyway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familylives.org.uk/about/news-blogs-and-reports/news/growing-levels-of-concern-from-parents-and-carers-experiencing-aggression-from-their-children/ Growing levels of concern from parents and carers experiencing aggression from their children]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familylives.org.uk/media_manager/public/209/Documents/Reports/When%20family%20life%20hurts%202010.pdf WHEN FAMILY LIFE HURTS: Family experience of aggression in children - Parentline plus 31 October 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619160335/http://familylives.org.uk/sites/default/files/When%20family%20hurts%202010.pdf |date=19 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parent abuse is defined by Cottrell as ‘any harmful act of a teenager that physically harms another person, in this case the parents.' He goes on to say that although parental abuse is real, it is never really caused by the child but by the parents themselves. (This is not always the case though as some parents have done everything in their power to help their child.) Although many people try and convince themselves that someone else is to blame for their child's actions, yet they are only making it worse for the child. Parents must take the time to learn their child so they can have a meaningful relationship that the kid wants to keep healthy.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-3/responding-parent-abuse|title=Responding to 'parent abuse' {{!}} The Psychologist|website=thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
[[Adolescent]] abuse towards parents and even grandparents is a problem in the United States as well as other countries around the world but it is something not often discussed or reported because most family abuse in general remains hidden from public view until law enforcement becomes involved.&lt;ref name='Cottrell'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/pdfs/Abuse_E.pdf |last=Cottrell |first=B., |year=2001 |title=The abuse of parents by their teenage children |publisher=Parent Abuse |accessdate=26 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227113055/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/pdfs/Abuse_E.pdf |archivedate=February 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Child abuse]] and [[spousal abuse]] are discussed, but parents abused by their own offspring are still considered by many to be a [[taboo]] subject, according to some researchers.  Reasons for this may be parents feel ashamed and/or think they should be able to handle the situation by themselves without outside assistance.&lt;ref name='Marin'&gt;{{cite web|last=Marin|first=B., (2010)|title=Parent Abused By Teens|url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/2010/parent-abuse-by-teen/|accessdate=26 May 2012|date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, some parents may feel it is not safe for them to attempt to control the situation for it might enrage their child more.  But any form of abuse is harmful to the victim as well as the abuser and may lead to more serious consequences if ignored.  Identifying or admitting there is a problem is the first step to finding a solution to adolescent parental abuse and seeking help through [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] is the next step to attempt to resolve problematic adolescent behavior.

It is difficult to ascertain the prevalence of the phenomenon due to the fact that it is hugely under reported by parents. Research carried out in Canada, United States and Oceania suggest that mothers, lone parents as well as parents facing social and family difficulties are more probable to experience parental abuse, especially if a child has experienced violence in the family.

A unique factor in parental abuse is 'the culture of blame', which has deepened over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-3/responding-parent-abuse|title=Responding to 'parent abuse'|last=|first=|date=|website=The British Psychological Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===Age===
Parental abuse by adolescents may be relatively common; an adolescent is a young person between the ages of 12 and 19.&lt;ref name='Bobic'&gt;{{cite web|last=Bobic|first=N., (2004)|title=Adolescent Violence Towards Parents|url=http://www.adfvc.unsw.edu.au/pdf%20files/adolescent_violence.pdf|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, abusers can be younger or older; in fact, according to a review, 11% of abusers may be less than age 10.&lt;ref name='Robinson'&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=P.W., et al. (2004) |title=Parents Abuse on the Rise |url=http://aabss.org/Perspectives2004/AABSS_58-67.pdf |work=A Historical Review |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129061110/http://aabss.org/Perspectives2004/AABSS_58-67.pdf |archivedate=January 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of abuse==

According to Cottrell&lt;ref name='Cottrell'/&gt; and Bobic,&lt;ref name='Bobic'/&gt; abuse may appear in one or a combination of five forms; [[physical abuse|physical]], [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], emotional, and [[financial abuse|financial]].  Bobic mentioned only four of the five listed abuses; verbal abuse was not included in her 2004 article, ''Adolescent [[Violence]] Towards Parents.''&lt;ref name='Bobic'/&gt;

==Multiple causes of abusive behavior==
Many people consider parent abuse to be the result of bad parenting, [[neglect]], or the child suffering abuse themselves, which some certainly have experienced, but other adolescent abusers have had "normal" upbringing and have not suffered from these situations.  Children may be subjected to [[violence]] on TV, in movies and in music, and that [[violence]] may come to be considered "normal."  The breakdown of the family unit, poor or nonexistent relationships with an absent parent, as well as, debt, unemployment, and parental drug/[[alcohol abuse]] may all be contributing factors to abuse.  Some other reasons for parental abuse according to several experts are:&lt;ref name='Cottrell'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Bobic'/&gt;

*arguments getting out of control;
*aggressive behavioral tendencies;
*frustration or inability to deal with problems;
*not having learned how to manage (or control) [[angry]] feelings;
*not able to learn how to manage or control behavior due to brain damage;
*witnessing other abuses at home can cause similar behaviors;
*lack of respect for their parents – perceived weakness;
* lack of consequences for bad behavior;
*children who have been abused may begin to fight back against their abusers.   
*[[fear]];
*[[drugs]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]];
*[[gang culture]];
*not having adequate role models;
*not being able to properly deal with a disabled or mentally ill parent(s);
*revenge or punishment for something the parents did or did not do; and
*[[mental illness]].
*[[corporal punishment]].

==History==
Parental abuse is a relatively new term. In 1979, Harbin and Madden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harbin,|first=H.T.|author2=Madden, D.J.|title=Battered Parents: A New Syndrome|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1979|volume=136|issue=10|pages=1288–1291|doi=10.1176/ajp.136.10.1288|pmid=484724|url=https://polipapers.upv.es/index.php/reinad/article/view/7325|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; released a study using the term “parent battery” but [[juvenile delinquency]], which is a major factor, has been studied since the late 19th century.&lt;ref name='Robinson'/&gt;  Even though some studies have been done in the United States, Australia, Canada, and other countries, the lack of reporting of adolescent abuse toward parents makes it difficult to accurately determine the extent of it.  Many studies have to rely on self-reporting by adolescents.&lt;ref  name='Patterson'&gt;{{cite web|last=Paterson|first=R., et al. (2002)|title=Maintaining Family Connections When The Going Gets Tough|url=http://www.anzjft.com/pages/articles/404.pdf|work=Adolescent Violence Towards Parents|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Agnew&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agnew|first=R.|author2=Huguley, S.|title=Adolescent violence towards parents|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|year=1989|volume=51|issue=3|pages=699–771|doi=10.2307/352169|jstor=352169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Robinson,&lt;ref name='Robinson'/&gt; of Brigham Young University, published: ''Parent Abuse on the Rise: A Historical Review'' in the American Association of Behavioral Social Science Online Journal, reporting results of the 1988 study performed by Evans and Warren-Sohlberg.&lt;ref name='Evans'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=D.|author2=Warren-Sohlberg, L.|title=A pattern analysis of adolescent abusive behaviour towards parents|journal=Journal of Adolescent Research|year=1989|volume=3|issue=2|pages=210–216|doi=10.1177/074355488832007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The results reported that 57% of parental abuse was physical; using a weapon at 17%; throwing items at 5% and [[verbal abuse]] reported at 22%.  With 82% of the abuse being against mothers (5 times greater than against fathers) and 11% of the abusers were under the age of 10 years.  The highest rate of abuse happens within families with a single mother.   Mothers are usually the primary caregiver; they spend more time with their children than fathers and have closer emotional connections to them.  It can also be due to the size and strength of the abuser and women are often thought of as weaker and even powerless.  Parental abuse can occur in any family and it is not necessarily associated with [[ethnic background]], [[socio-economic class]], or [[sexual orientation]].

Numerous studies concluded that gender does not play a role in the total number of perpetrators; however, males are more likely to inflict [[physical abuse]] and females are more likely to inflict [[emotional abuse]].&lt;ref name='Cottrell'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Agnew/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World report on violence and health|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/summary_en.pdf|work=Summary|publisher=World Health Organization (2002)|accessdate=13 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies from the United States estimate that violence among adolescents peaks at 15–17 years old.&lt;ref name='Evans'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stauss, M., Gelles, R., &amp; Steinmetz S.|title=Behind closed doors: violence in the American family|year=1988|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=J.,|title=Physical abuse of parents by adolescent children, in Busby, D.M. (ed) The impact of violence on the family: treatment approaches for therapists and other professionals|year=1996|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Massachusetts|pages=101–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a Canadian study done by Barbara Cottrell in 2001 suggests the ages are 12–14 years old.&lt;ref name='Cottrell'/&gt;

Parental abuse does not happen just inside the home but can be in public places, further adding to the humiliation of the parents.  Abuse is not only a domestic affair but can be [[criminal]] as well.  Most teenagers experience a normal transition in which they try to go from being [[dependency need|dependent]] to independent, but there are some dynamics of unhealthy parental control that also play a direct part in the failure to properly raise a child in this regard.  There will always be times of resistance toward parental authority.  According to the Canadian National Clearinghouse on [[Family Violence]] the abuse generally begins with [[verbal abuse]], but even then, some females can be very physically abusive towards a child who is smaller and more vulnerable than they are, and to cover their abuse, they often lie to the other parent about actual events that led to "severe punishment." The child, adolescent or parent may show no remorse or guilt and feels justified in the behavior, but many times when the child is the one who is being abused, they are very remorseful for being forced to defend themselves, especially when they are not the aggressor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stephenson|first=K., (2008)|title=Parents Abuse on the Rise|url=http://aabss.org/Perspectives2004/AABSS_58-67.pdf|work=A Historical Review|accessdate=2 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129061110/http://aabss.org/Perspectives2004/AABSS_58-67.pdf|archivedate=29 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parents must examine their children’s behavior and determine if it is acceptable or if it crosses the line of abusiveness, just as a parent has the responsibility as an adult who is supposed to know better should be responsible for his/her own abuses towards a child.  Some teenagers can become aggressive as a result of parental abuses and dysfunction or psychological problems.  Some children may have trouble dealing with their emotions, that is all part of growing up but there is a line that should not be crossed and parents may determine where that line is.  Unfortunately, abused children are not afforded protections from abusive parents. This practice often helps discourage abusive behavior and show that it will not be tolerated.&lt;ref name='Cottrell'/&gt;

==Typical model of adolescent-parent abuse interaction==
According to Spitzberg the typical [[interaction]] leading to parental abuse often seems to occur in the following sequence:&lt;ref name='Spitzberg'&gt;{{cite book|last=Spitzberg, B.H. &amp; Cupach, W.R. (Eds.)|title=Adolescent-to-Parent Abuse:  Exploring the Communicative Patterns Leading to Verbal, Physical, and Emotional Abuse. The Dark Side of Interpersonal Communication (2nd ed.)|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8058-4450-4|pages=363–385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#the adolescent makes a request;
#the parent asks for clarifying information;
#the adolescent responds courteously and provides the requested information;
#the parent acknowledges the teen’s point of view but decides to say “no” based on the information provided, while possibly continuing the conversation regarding a possible “next time”;
#the adolescent tries to change the mind of the parent by asking the parent to explain the decision, sometimes using the information to continue to challenge the parent until certain that the answer would not change; and
#if the parent holds firm to his or her decision, the teen may start using abusive remarks and threats, harass the parent by following the parent around, and finally responding with verbal threats, physical force, [[emotional abuse]], and often destruction of property or financial damage.

These types of aggressive behaviors are very important to recognize for appropriate treatment of adolescents and parents abused by the same.  Yet the escalation of violence is an interactive process.  When parents or others overreact and intervene emotionally, they can cause the adolescent’s aggression to escalate to a higher level, by exerting examples of violence and unreasonableness as a parent. The more tendency towards abuse and negative behaviors that the parent exemplifies, the more reactive the child will also be, more often in a negative manner. Balancing these two dynamics is the key to healthy family dynamics in reducing potential abuse within families, whether it be parental abuses or child abuses.

==Intervention==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}

[[Intervention (counseling)|Intervention]] is perhaps the best solution to confront adolescent parental abuse and the key to turn aggressive behavior by adolescents, teenagers, and young adults during its early stages and help prevent any other form of parental abuse from taking place.

While Intervention is an option, it may not always work. There are times when the child does have a mental illness that does not allow the child, adolescent or teenager to understand what is exactly happening. Therefore, the individual acts out their emotions the only way they understand. This can present itself as violence, emotional abuse, destructive behaviors such as destroying personal property or self bodily injury. The United States currently protects abused children using Courts, [[Child Protective Services]] and other agencies. The US also has [[Adult Protective Services]] which is provided to abused, neglected, or exploited older adults and adults with significant disabilities. There are no agencies or programs that protect parents from abusive children, adolescents or teenagers other than giving up their Parental Rights to the state they live in.

A '''polar city''' is a proposed sustainable polar retreat designed to house human beings in the future, in the event that global warming causes the equatorial and middle latitudes of the Earth to become uninhabitable for a long period of time. Although they have not been built yet, some futurists have been giving considerable thought to the concepts involved. High-population-density cities, to be built near the [[Arctic]] Rim and in [[Antarctica]], [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Patagonia]], with sustainable energy and transportation infrastructure, will require substantial nearby agriculture. Boreal soils are largely poor in key nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, but nitrogen-fixing plants (such as the various [[alder]]s) with the proper symbiotic microbes and mycorrhizal fungi can likely remedy such poverty without the need for petroleum-derived fertilizers. Regional probiotic soil improvement should perhaps rank high on any polar cities priority list. [[James Lovelock]]'s notion of a widely distributed almanac of science knowledge and post-industrial survival skills also appears to have value.

== History ==

The polar cities climate retreat living pod concept is a worst-case scenario prediction&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/roundtables/has-the-time-come-geoengineering#rt3845 "We should plan for the worst-case climate scenario" Ken Caldeira, ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists''] 29 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; based on the ideas of British
chemist and inventor [[James Lovelock]]: life in polar cities&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.mongabay.com/2008/03/18/polar-cities-is-an-idea-whose-time-i-hope-never-comes/ "“Polar Cities” is an idea whose time I hope never comes" ]&lt;/ref&gt; arrayed inland and
around the shores of an ice-free [[Arctic Ocean]] in a greenhouse-warmed
world. Dr. Lovelock, who in 1972 conceived of the Earth's crust, climate,
and veneer of life as a unified self-sustaining entity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaia hypothesis]]&lt;/ref&gt; foresees
humanity in full pole-bound retreat within a century as areas around
the tropics roast — a scenario far outside even the worst-case
projections of climate scientists.

After reading a newspaper column&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/james-lovelock-the-earth-is-about-to-catch-a-morbid-fever-that-may-last-as-long-as-100000-years-523161.html "James Lovelock: The Earth is about to catch a morbid fever that may last as long as 100,000 years", ''The Independent''] 16 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006 in which Dr. Lovelock predicted
disastrous warming, Danny Bloom, a freelance newspaper reporter and climate blogger, teamed up with Deng Cheng-hong, a Taiwanese
artist, and set up websites showing designs for self-sufficient
Arctic communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climatechange3000.blogspot.com/ "Global Warming and Polar Cities"]&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Bloom's intent is to conduct a non-threatening thought
experiment that might prod people out of their comfort zone on climate change.

== Popular culture ==

In 2012, two books about polar cities were published. ''Polar City Red'', by Jim Laughter, is a [[climate fiction]] novel about life in
a polar city in the year 2075 in Alaska. ''Polar City Dreaming: How Climate Change Might Usher In The Age Of Polar Cities,'' by Stephan Malone, is a nonfiction history of polar city ideas.

== Design ==

The design of polar cities climate retreat living pods is currently (2008) driven entirely by volunteers under the name of "The Polar City Project". Danny Bloom is currently leading this effort.  The defining design characteristics are efficiency, both for operational costs as well as construction costs, and a desire for the city to be a [[Zero energy building]]. The proposed agricultural module, for example, is a [[Sustainable agriculture]] vertical farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verticalfarm.com/ "The Vertical Farm Project"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''principle of permanence''' is that a complex function (or functional equation) which is 0 on a set with a non-[[isolated point]] is 0 everywhere (or at least on the [[connected component (topology)|connected component]] of its domain which contains the point). There are various statements of the principle, depending on the type of function or equation considered.

==For a complex function of one variable==
For one variable, the principle of permanence states that if ''f''(''z'') is an [[analytic function]] defined on an [[open set|open]] [[connected set|connected]] subset ''U'' of the complex numbers '''C''', and there exists a [[convergent sequence]] {''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} having a limit ''L'' which is in ''U'', such that ''f''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''n'', then ''f''(''z'') is uniformly zero on ''U''.&lt;ref&gt;'The Language of Science'', [[Tobias Dantzig]], [[Joseph Mazur]], and [[Barry Mazur]], 2007, Penguin Books, pp.&amp;nbsp;98, 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
One of the main uses of the principle of permanence is to show that a functional equation that holds for the real numbers also holds for the complex numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |surname=Dauben|given= Joseph W.|year=1979|title=Georg Cantor: his mathematics and philosophy of the infinite|place=Boston|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-02447-9|ref=Dauben1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, the function e&lt;sup&gt;s+t&lt;/sup&gt;-e&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;=0 on the [[real number]]s. By the principle of permanence for functions of two variables, this implies that e&lt;sup&gt;s+t&lt;/sup&gt;-e&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;=0 for all complex numbers, thus proving one of the laws of exponents for complex exponents.&lt;ref name = "Gamelin" &gt;Gamelin, T.

The '''RNA world''' is a hypothetical stage in the [[evolutionary history of life]] on Earth, in which [[self-replicating]] [[RNA]] molecules proliferated before the evolution of [[DNA]] and [[protein]]s.  The term also refers to the hypothesis that posits the existence of this stage.

[[Alexander Rich]] first proposed the concept of the RNA world in 1962,&lt;ref name="Neveu et al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neveu M, Kim HJ, Benner SA | title = The "strong" RNA world hypothesis: fifty years old | journal = Astrobiology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–403 | date = Apr 2013 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1089/ast.2012.0868 | pmid = 23551238 | bibcode = 2013AsBio..13..391N |quote= [The RNA world's existence] has broad support within the community today.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Gilbert]] coined the term in 1986.&lt;ref name="Cech2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cech TR | title = The RNA worlds in context | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = a006742 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 21441585 | pmc = 3385955 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a006742 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative chemical paths to life have been proposed,&lt;ref name="NC-20150316"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patel BH, Percivalle C, Ritson DJ, Duffy CD, Sutherland JD | title = Common origins of RNA, protein and lipid precursors in a cyanosulfidic protometabolism | journal = Nature Chemistry | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 301–7 | date = Apr 2015 | pmid = 25803468 | pmc = 4568310 | doi = 10.1038/nchem.2202 | url = http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v7/n4/full/nchem.2202.html | bibcode = 2015NatCh...7..301P }}&lt;/ref&gt; and RNA-based life may not have been the first life to exist.&lt;ref name="Cech2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robertson2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robertson MP, Joyce GF | title = The origins of the RNA world | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = a003608 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 20739415 | pmc = 3331698 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a003608 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the evidence for an RNA world is strong enough that the hypothesis has gained wide acceptance.&lt;ref name="Neveu et al" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150504"&gt;{{cite news |last= Wade |first= Nicholas |authorlink= Nicholas Wade |title= Making Sense of the Chemistry That Led to Life on Earth |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/science/making-sense-of-the-chemistry-that-led-to-life-on-earth.html |date= May 4, 2015 |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= May 10, 2015 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170709115606/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/science/making-sense-of-the-chemistry-that-led-to-life-on-earth.html |archivedate= July 9, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Copley SD, Smith E, Morowitz HJ | title = The origin of the RNA world: co-evolution of genes and metabolism | journal = Bioorganic Chemistry | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 430–43 | date = Dec 2007 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.bioorg.2007.08.001 | pmid = 17897696 |quote= The proposal that life on Earth arose from an RNA World is widely accepted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like DNA, RNA can store and replicate genetic information; like protein [[enzyme]]s, RNA enzymes ([[ribozyme]]s) can [[catalyze]] (start or accelerate) chemical reactions that are critical for [[life]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20140925-CZ"&gt;{{cite news |last= Zimmer |first= Carl |authorlink= Carl Zimmer |title= A Tiny Emissary from the Ancient Past |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/science/a-tiny-emissary-from-the-ancient-past.html |date= September 25, 2014 |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= September 26, 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140927022738/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/science/a-tiny-emissary-from-the-ancient-past.html |archivedate= September 27, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most critical components of cells, the [[ribosome]], is composed primarily of RNA. Ribonucleotide moieties in many coenzymes, such as [[Acetyl-CoA]], [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]], [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH]] and [[Coenzyme F420|F420]], have long been thought of{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} as surviving remnants of covalently bound coenzymes in an RNA world.&lt;ref name='hong'&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Shen |first1= Liang. |last2= Hong-Fang |first2= Ji |title= Small Cofactors May Assist Protein Emergence from RNA World: Clues from RNA-Protein Complexes |pmid= 21789260 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0022494 |volume= 6 |issue= 7 |pmc= 3138788 |year= 2011 |journal= PLOS One |page= e22494|bibcode= 2011PLoSO...622494S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although RNA is fragile, some ancient RNAs may have evolved the ability to [[methylate]] other RNAs to protect them.&lt;ref name="Rana"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rana |first1= Ajay K. |last2= Ankri |first2= Serge |title= Reviving the RNA World: An Insight into the Appearance of RNA Methyltransferases |pmid= 27375676 |doi= 10.3389/fgene.2016.00099 |volume= 7 |pmc= 4893491 |year= 2016 |journal= Front Genet |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the RNA world existed, it was probably followed by an age characterized by the evolution of [[ribonucleoprotein]]s ([[RNP world]]),&lt;ref name="Cech2012"/&gt; which in turn ushered in the era of DNA and longer proteins. DNA has better stability and durability than RNA; this may explain why it became the predominant storage molecule.&lt;ref name="PiP"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Protein enzymes may have come to replace RNA-based ribozymes as [[Biocatalysis|biocatalysts]] because their greater abundance and diversity of [[monomers]] makes them more versatile.

One of the challenges in studying [[abiogenesis]] is that the system of reproduction and metabolism utilized by all extant life involves three distinct types of interdependent macromolecules ([[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein]]). This suggests that life could not have arisen in its current form, which has led researchers to hypothesize mechanisms whereby the current system might have arisen from a simpler precursor system. The concept of RNA as a primordial molecule&lt;ref name= Cech2012 /&gt; can be found in papers by [[Francis Crick]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crick FH | title = The origin of the genetic code | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–79 | date = Dec 1968 | pmid = 4887876 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(68)90392-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leslie Orgel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orgel LE | title = Evolution of the genetic apparatus | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–93 | date = Dec 1968 | pmid = 5718557 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(68)90393-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Carl Woese]]'s 1967 book ''The Genetic Code''.&lt;ref&gt;Woese C.R.

== Properties of RNA ==
The properties of RNA make the idea of the RNA world hypothesis conceptually plausible, though its general acceptance as an explanation for the origin of life requires further evidence.&lt;ref name="Atk06" /&gt; RNA is known to form efficient catalysts and its similarity to DNA makes clear its ability to store information.

{{Further|Ribozyme}}

[[Ribozyme|RNA enzymes]], or ribozymes, are found in today's DNA-based life and could be examples of [[living fossil]]s. Ribozymes play vital roles, such as that of the [[ribosome]], an RNA-protein complex responsible for protein synthesis.

Among the enzymatic properties important for the beginning of life are:
;Self-replication
:The ability to [[self-replication|self-replicate]], or synthesize other RNA molecules; relatively short RNA molecules that can synthesize others have been artificially produced in the lab. The shortest was 165-bases long, though it has been estimated that only part of the molecule was crucial for this function. One version, 189-bases long, had an error rate of just 1.1% per nucleotide when synthesizing an 11 nucleotide long RNA strand from primed template strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnston WK, Unrau PJ, Lawrence MS, Glasner ME, Bartel DP | title = RNA-catalyzed RNA polymerization: accurate and general RNA-templated primer extension | journal = Science | volume = 292 | issue = 5520 | pages = 1319–25 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11358999 | doi = 10.1126/science.1060786 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/292/5520/1319 | bibcode = 2001Sci...292.1319J | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071001010311/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/292/5520/1319 | archivedate = 2007-10-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This 189 base pair ribozyme could polymerize a template of at most 14 nucleotides in length, which is too short for self replication, but is a potential lead for further investigation.

Each RNA polymerase ribozyme was engineered to remain linked to its new, synthesized RNA strand, this allowed the team to isolate successful polymerases. The isolated RNA polymerases were again used for another round of evolution. After several rounds of evolution, they obtained one RNA polymerase ribozyme called 24-3 that was able to copy almost any other RNA, from small catalysts to long RNA based enzymes. Particular RNAs were amplified up to 10,000 times, a first RNA version of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The RNA polymerase is not yet able to make copies of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horning|first=David P.|last2=Joyce|first2=Gerald F.|date=2016-08-15|title=Amplification of RNA by an RNA polymerase ribozyme|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/10/1610103113|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=113|issue=35|pages=9786–91|doi=10.1073/pnas.1610103113|issn=0027-8424|pmid=27528667|pmc=5024611|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819184015/http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/10/1610103113|archivedate=2016-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Catalysis
:The ability to [[Catalysis|catalyze]] simple chemical reactions—which would enhance creation of molecules that are building blocks of RNA molecules (i.e., a strand of RNA that would make creating more strands of RNA easier).

For instance, an arbitrarily chosen 50-nucleotide DNA fragment encoding for the ''[[Taurine cattle|Bos taurus]]'' (cattle) [[albumin]] mRNA was subjected to test-tube evolution to derive a catalytic DNA ([[Deoxyribozyme]], also called DNAzyme) with RNA-cleavage activity.

If in vitro evolution works for DNA it will happen much more easily with RNA.
;Amino acid-RNA ligation

;Peptide bond formation
:The ability to catalyse the formation of [[peptide bonds]] between amino acids to produce short [[peptide]]s or longer [[protein]]s. This is done in modern cells by ribosomes, a complex of several RNA molecules known as [[rRNA]] together with many proteins.

=== RNA in information storage ===
RNA is a very similar molecule to DNA, with only two major chemical differences (the backbone of RNA uses ribose instead of deoxyribose and its nucleobases include uracil instead of thymine). The overall structure of RNA and DNA are immensely similar—one strand of DNA and one of RNA can bind to form a double helical structure. This makes the storage of information in RNA possible in a very similar way to the storage of information in DNA. However, RNA is less stable, being more prone to hydrolysis due to the presence of a hydroxyl group at the ribose 2' position.

[[File:RNA chemical structure.GIF|thumb|The major difference between RNA and DNA is the presence of a [[hydroxyl]] group at the 2'-position.]]

==== Comparison of DNA and RNA structure ====
{{Main|RNA|DNA}}

The major difference between RNA and DNA is the presence of a [[hydroxyl]] group at the 2'-position of the [[ribose]] sugar in RNA (illustration, right).&lt;ref name="Atk06" /&gt; This group makes the molecule less stable because, when not constrained in a double helix, the 2' hydroxyl can chemically attack the adjacent [[phosphodiester bond]] to cleave the phosphodiester backbone. The hydroxyl group also forces the ribose into the C3'-''endo'' sugar conformation unlike the C2'-''endo'' conformation of the [[deoxyribose]] sugar in DNA. This forces an RNA double helix to change from a [[B-DNA]] structure to one more closely resembling [[A-DNA]].

RNA also uses a different set of bases than DNA—[[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]] and [[uracil]], instead of adenine, guanine, cytosine and [[thymine]]. Chemically, uracil is similar to thymine, differing only by a [[methyl group]], and its production requires less energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humpath.com/uracil |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930044720/http://www.humpath.com/uracil |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of base pairing, this has no effect. Adenine readily binds uracil or thymine. Uracil is, however, one product of damage to cytosine that makes RNA particularly susceptible to mutations that can replace a '''GC''' base pair with a '''GU''' ([[wobble base pair|wobble]]) or '''AU''' [[base pair]].

RNA is thought to have preceded DNA, because of their ordering in the biosynthetic pathways. The deoxyribonucleotides used to make DNA are made from ribonucleotides, the building blocks of RNA, by removing the 2'-hydroxyl group. As a consequence a cell must have the ability to make RNA before it can make DNA.

==== Limitations of information storage in RNA ====
The chemical properties of RNA make large RNA [[molecule]]s inherently fragile, and they can easily be broken down into their constituent nucleotides through [[hydrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindahl T | title = Instability and decay of the primary structure of DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 362 | issue = 6422 | pages = 709–15 | date = Apr 1993 | pmid = 8469282 | doi = 10.1038/362709a0 | bibcode = 1993Natur.362..709L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ancient DNA|journal=Scientific American|first=S|last=Pääbo|volume=269|pages=60–66|date=November 1993|issue=5|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1193-86|bibcode=1993SciAm.269e..86P}}&lt;/ref&gt; These limitations do not make use of RNA as an information storage system impossible, simply energy intensive (to repair or replace damaged RNA molecules) and prone to mutation. While this makes it unsuitable for current 'DNA optimised' life, it may have been acceptable for more primitive life.

=== RNA as a regulator ===
{{Main|Riboswitch}}
Riboswitches have been found to act as regulators of gene expression, particularly in bacteria, but also in plants and [[archaea]]. Riboswitches alter their [[secondary structure]] in response to the binding of a [[metabolite]]. This change in structure can result in the formation or disruption of a [[Terminator (genetics)|terminator]], truncating or permitting transcription respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nudler E, Mironov AS | title = The riboswitch control of bacterial metabolism | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–7 | date = Jan 2004 | pmid = 14729327 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2003.11.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, riboswitches may bind or occlude the [[Shine-Dalgarno sequence]], affecting translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tucker BJ, Breaker RR | title = Riboswitches as versatile gene control elements | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 342–8 | date = Jun 2005 | pmid = 15919195 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2005.05.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that these originated in an RNA-based world.&lt;ref name="pmid18778966"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bocobza SE, Aharoni A | title = Switching the light on plant riboswitches | journal = Trends Plant Sci. | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 526–33 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18778966 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2008.07.004 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[RNA thermometer]]s regulate gene expression in response to temperature changes.&lt;ref name="Nar06"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Narberhaus F, Waldminghaus T, Chowdhury S | title = RNA thermometers | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–16 | date = Jan 2006 | pmid = 16438677 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2005.004.x | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0168-6445&amp;date=2006&amp;volume=30&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support and difficulties ==
The RNA world hypothesis is supported by RNA's ability to store, transmit, and duplicate [[genetics|genetic]] information, as [[DNA]] does. RNA can act as a ribozyme, a special type of [[enzyme]]. Because it can perform the tasks of both DNA and enzymes, RNA is believed to have once been capable of supporting independent life forms.&lt;ref name="Atk06" /&gt; Some [[virus]]es use RNA as their genetic material, rather than DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Patton, John T.

Since there were no known chemical pathways for the abiogenic synthesis of nucleotides from [[pyrimidine]] nucleobases cytosine and uracil under prebiotic conditions, it is thought by some that nucleic acids did not contain these [[nucleobase]]s seen in life's nucleic acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orgel LE | title = The origin of life on the earth | journal = Scientific American | volume = 271 | issue = 4 | pages = 76–83 | date = Oct 1994 | pmid = 7524147 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1094-76 | bibcode = 1994SciAm.271d..76O }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nucleoside cytosine has a half-life in isolation of 19 days at {{convert|100|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and 17,000 years in freezing water, which some argue is too short on the [[geologic time scale]] for accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy M, Miller SL | title = The stability of the RNA bases: implications for the origin of life | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 14 | pages = 7933–8 | date = Jul 1998 | pmid = 9653118 | pmc = 20907 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.14.7933 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.7933L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have questioned whether [[ribose]] and other backbone sugars could be stable enough to find in the original genetic material,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Larralde R, Robertson MP, Miller SL | title = Rates of decomposition of ribose and other sugars: implications for chemical evolution | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 18 | pages = 8158–60 | date = Aug 1995 | pmid = 7667262 | pmc = 41115 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.92.18.8158 | bibcode = 1995PNAS...92.8158L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have raised the issue that all ribose molecules would have had to be the same [[enantiomer]], as any nucleotide of the wrong [[chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] acts as a chain [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joyce GF, Visser GM, van Boeckel CA, van Boom JH, Orgel LE, van Westrenen J | title = Chiral selection in poly(C)-directed synthesis of oligo(G) | journal = Nature | volume = 310 | issue = 5978 | pages = 602–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6462250 | doi = 10.1038/310602a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.310..602J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrimidine ribonucleosides and their respective nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesised by a sequence of reactions that by-pass free sugars and assemble in a stepwise fashion by including nitrogenous and oxygenous chemistries.

== Prebiotic RNA synthesis ==
Nucleotides are the fundamental molecules that combine in series to form RNA. They consist of a nitrogenous base attached to a sugar-phosphate backbone. RNA is made of long stretches of specific nucleotides arranged so that their sequence of bases carries information. The RNA world hypothesis holds that in the [[primordial soup]] (or [[primordial sandwich|sandwich]]), there existed free-floating nucleotides. These nucleotides regularly formed bonds with one another, which often broke because the change in energy was so low. However, certain sequences of base pairs have catalytic properties that lower the energy of their chain being created, enabling them to stay together for longer periods of time. As each chain grew longer, it attracted more matching nucleotides faster, causing chains to now form faster than they were breaking down.

These chains have been proposed by some as the first, primitive forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Villarreal LP, Witzany G | year = 2013 | title = The DNA Habitat and its RNA Inhabitants: At the Dawn of RNA | url = | journal = Sociology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 1–12 | doi = 10.4137/GEI.S11490 | pmc = 4510605 | pmid=26217106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an RNA world, different sets of RNA strands would have had different replication outputs, which would have increased or decreased their frequency in the population, i.e. [[natural selection]]. As the fittest sets of RNA molecules expanded their numbers, novel catalytic properties added by mutation, which benefitted their persistence and expansion, could accumulate in the population. Such an [[autocatalytic set]] of ribozymes, capable of self replication in about an hour, has been identified. It was produced by molecular competition ([[Directed evolution|''in vitro'' evolution]]) of candidate enzyme mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lincoln TA, Joyce GF | title = Self-sustained replication of an RNA enzyme | journal = Science | volume = 323 | issue = 5918 | pages = 1229–32 | date = Feb 2009 | pmid = 19131595 | pmc = 2652413 | doi = 10.1126/science.1167856 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1167856 | publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science | laydate = January 12, 2009 | laysource = Medical News Today | laysummary = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/135031.php | bibcode = 2009Sci...323.1229L | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122203819/http://sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1167856 | archivedate = January 22, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition between RNA may have favored the emergence of cooperation between different RNA chains, opening the way for the formation of the first [[protocell]]. Eventually, RNA chains developed with catalytic properties that help [[amino acid]]s bind together (a process called [[peptide bond|peptide-bonding]]). These amino acids could then assist with RNA synthesis, giving those RNA chains that could serve as ribozymes the selective advantage. The ability to catalyze one step in protein synthesis, [[Transfer RNA#Aminoacylation|aminoacylation]] of RNA, has been demonstrated in a short (five-nucleotide) segment of RNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turk RM, Chumachenko NV, Yarus M | title = Multiple translational products from a five-nucleotide ribozyme | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 10 | pages = 4585–9 | date = Mar 2010 | pmid = 20176971 | pmc = 2826339 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0912895107 | laysummary = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/02/100222162009.htm | laydate = February 24, 2010 | laysource = ScienceDaily | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.4585T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrimidine, like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), may have been formed in [[Red giant|giant red stars]] or in [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] and gas clouds, according to the scientists.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150303"&gt;{{cite web |last=Marlaire |first=Ruth |name-list-format=vanc |title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory |date=3 March 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=5 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305083306/http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory/ |archivedate=5 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, researchers at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] identified three molecular candidates for the bases that might have formed an earliest version of proto-RNA: [[barbituric acid]], [[melamine]], and [[pyrimidine|2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine]]. These three molecules are simpler versions of the four bases in current RNA, which could have been present in larger amounts and could still be [[Forward compatibility|forwards compatibile]] with them, but may have been discarded by evolution in exchange for more optimal base pairs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/new-study-identifies-possible-ancestors-of-rna/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of DNA==
One of the problems with the RNA world hypothesis is to discover the pathway by which RNA became upgraded to the DNA system. Geoffrey Diemer and Ken Stedman, at Portland State University in Oregon, may have found a solution. While conducting a survey of viruses in a hot acidic lake in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, they uncovered evidence that a simple DNA virus had acquired a gene from a completely unrelated RNA-based virus. Virologist Luis Villareal of the University of California Irvine also suggests that viruses capable of converting an RNA-based gene into DNA and then incorporating it into a more complex DNA-based genome might have been common in the Virus world during the RNA to DNA transition some 4 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Bob (2012) "First Glimpse at the birth of DNA" (New Scientist April 12, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diemer GS, Stedman KM | title = A novel virus genome discovered in an extreme environment suggests recombination between unrelated groups of RNA and DNA viruses | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 13 | date = 19 April 2012 | pmid = 22515485 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-7-13 | url = http://www.biologydirect.com/content/7/1/13 | access-date = 7 February 2015 | publisher = [[BioMed Central]] | pmc = 3372434 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150207003856/http://www.biologydirect.com/content/7/1/13 | archivedate = 7 February 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding bolsters the argument for the transfer of information from the RNA world to the emerging DNA world before the emergence of the [[last universal common ancestor]]. From the research, the diversity of this virus world is still with us.

== Viroids ==
{{Main|Viroid}}

Additional evidence supporting the concept of an RNA world has resulted from research on [[viroid]]s, the first representatives of a novel domain of "subviral pathogens".&lt;ref name="pmid5095900"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diener TO | title = Potato spindle tuber "virus".

Viroids are mostly plant pathogens, which consist of short stretches (a few hundred nucleobases) of highly complementary, circular, single-stranded, and non-coding RNA without a protein coat. Compared with other infectious plant pathogens, viroids are extremely small in size, ranging from 246 to 467 nucleobases. In comparison, the genome of the smallest known viruses capable of causing an infection are about 2,000 nucleobases long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanger HL, Klotz G, Riesner D, Gross HJ, Kleinschmidt AK | title = Viroids are single-stranded covalently closed circular RNA molecules existing as highly base-paired rod-like structures | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 73 | issue = 11 | pages = 3852–6 | date = Nov 1976 | pmid = 1069269 | doi=10.1073/pnas.73.11.3852 | pmc=431239| bibcode = 1976PNAS...73.3852S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Diener proposed that, based on their characteristic properties, viroids are more plausible "living relics" of the RNA world than are [[introns]] or other RNAs then so considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diener TO | year = 1989 | title = Circular RNAs: Relics of precellular evolution? | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 86 | issue = 23| pages = 9370–9374 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.86.23.9370 | pmid = 2480600 | pmc=298497| bibcode = 1989PNAS...86.9370D }}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, viroids have attained potential significance beyond plant pathology to evolutionary biology, by representing the most plausible macromolecules known capable of explaining crucial intermediate steps in the evolution of life from inanimate matter (see: [[abiogenesis]]).

Apparently, Diener's hypothesis lay dormant until 2014, when Flores et al. published a review paper, in which Diener's evidence supporting his hypothesis was summarized.&lt;ref name="Flores, R. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flores R, Gago-Zachert S, Serra P, Sanjuan R, Elena SF | year = 2014 | title = Viroids: Survivors from the RNA World? | url = | journal = Annu.

Pertinent viroid properties listed in 1989 are:

# their small size, imposed by error-prone replication;
# their high guanine and cytosine content, which increases stability and replication fidelity;
# their circular structure, which assures complete replication without genomic tags;
# existence of structural periodicity, which permits modular assembly into enlarged genomes;
# their lack of protein-coding ability, consistent with a ribosome-free habitat; and
# replication mediated in some by ribozymes—the fingerprint of the RNA world.&lt;ref name="Flores, R. 2014" /&gt;

The existence, in extant cells, of RNAs with molecular properties predicted for RNAs of the RNA World constitutes an additional argument supporting the RNA World hypothesis.

A protocell that was haploid (one copy of each RNA gene) would be vulnerable to damage, since a single lesion in any RNA segment would be potentially lethal to the protocell (e.g. by blocking replication or inhibiting the function of an essential gene).

Vulnerability to damage could be reduced by maintaining two or more copies of each RNA segment in each protocell, i.e. by maintaining diploidy or polyploidy. Genome redundancy would allow a damaged RNA segment to be replaced by an additional replication of its homolog. However, for such a simple organism, the proportion of available resources tied up in the genetic material would be a large fraction of the total resource budget. Under limited resource conditions, the protocell reproductive rate would likely be inversely related to ploidy number. The protocell's fitness would be reduced by the costs of redundancy. Consequently, coping with damaged RNA genes while minimizing the costs of redundancy would likely have been a fundamental problem for early protocells.

A cost-benefit analysis was carried out in which the costs of maintaining redundancy were balanced against the costs of genome damage.&lt;ref name=Bernstein84&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RE | title = Origin of sex | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 110 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–51 | date = Oct 1984 | pmid = 6209512 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5193(84)80178-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis led to the conclusion that, under a wide range of circumstances, the selected strategy would be for each protocell to be haploid, but to periodically fuse with another haploid protocell to form a transient diploid. The retention of the haploid state maximizes the growth rate. The periodic fusions permit mutual reactivation of otherwise lethally damaged protocells. If at least one damage-free copy of each RNA gene is present in the transient diploid, viable progeny can be formed. For two, rather than one, viable daughter cells to be produced would require an extra replication of the intact RNA gene homologous to any RNA gene that had been damaged prior to the division of the fused protocell. The cycle of haploid reproduction, with occasional fusion to a transient diploid state, followed by splitting to the haploid state, can be considered to be the sexual cycle in its most primitive form.&lt;ref name=Bernstein84 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = Carol | last2 = Bernstein | first2 = Harris | name-list-format = vanc | title = Aging, sex, and DNA repair |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=0-12-092860-4 |oclc= |doi= }} see pgs. 293-297&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of this sexual cycle, haploid protocells with damage in an essential RNA gene would simply die.

This model for the early sexual cycle is hypothetical, but it is very similar to the known sexual behavior of the segmented RNA viruses, which are among the simplest organisms known. [[Orthomyxoviridae|Influenza virus]], whose genome consists of 8 physically separated single-stranded RNA segments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamb RA, Choppin PW | title = The gene structure and replication of influenza virus | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 52 | issue =  | pages = 467–506 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6351727 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.52.070183.002343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of this type of virus. In segmented RNA viruses, "mating" can occur when a host cell is infected by at least two virus particles. If these viruses each contain an RNA segment with a lethal damage, multiple infection can lead to reactivation providing that at least one undamaged copy of each virus gene is present in the infected cell. This phenomenon is known as "multiplicity reactivation".

== Further developments ==
[[Patrick Forterre]] has been working on a novel hypothesis, called "three viruses, three domains":&lt;ref name=3V3D /&gt; that viruses were instrumental in the transition from RNA to DNA and the evolution of [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]]. He believes the [[last universal common ancestor]]&lt;ref name=3V3D /&gt; was RNA-based and evolved RNA viruses. Some of the viruses evolved into DNA viruses to protect their genes from attack. Through the process of viral infection into hosts the three domains of life evolved.&lt;ref name=3V3D&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1450140 | pmid=16505372 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0510333103 | volume=103 | issue=10 | title=Three RNA cells for ribosomal lineages and three DNA viruses to replicate their genomes: a hypothesis for the origin of cellular domain | date=March 2006 | journal=Proc.

[[Steven Benner]] has argued that chemical conditions on the planet [[Mars]], such as the presence of [[boron]], [[molybdenum]] and [[oxygen]], may have been better for initially producing RNA molecules than those on [[Earth]].

== Alternative hypotheses ==

The hypothesized existence of an RNA world does not exclude a "Pre-RNA world", where a metabolic system based on a different nucleic acid is proposed to pre-date RNA. A candidate nucleic acid is peptide nucleic acid ([[Peptide nucleic acid|PNA]]), which uses simple [[peptide bond]]s to link nucleobases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Egholm M, Buchardt O, Christensen L, Behrens C, Freier SM, Driver DA, Berg RH, Kim SK, Norden B, Nielsen PE | title = PNA hybridizes to complementary oligonucleotides obeying the Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonding rules | journal = Nature | volume = 365 | issue = 6446 | pages = 566–8 | date = Oct 1993 | pmid = 7692304 | doi = 10.1038/365566a0 | bibcode = 1993Natur.365..566E | url = http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/pna-hybridizes-to-complementary-oligonucleotides-obeying-the-watsoncrick-hydrogenbonding-rules(e4e4fdf9-920e-48b0-a3fa-86129ffff0b8).html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171117142659/http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/pna-hybridizes-to-complementary-oligonucleotides-obeying-the-watsoncrick-hydrogenbonding-rules(e4e4fdf9-920e-48b0-a3fa-86129ffff0b8).html | archivedate = 2017-11-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; PNA is more stable than RNA, but its ability to be generated under prebiological conditions has yet to be demonstrated experimentally.

Threose nucleic acid ([[TNA (nucleic acid)|TNA]]) has also been proposed as a starting point, as has glycol nucleic acid ([[GNA (nucleic acid)|GNA]]), and like PNA, also lack experimental evidence for their respective abiogenesis.

An alternative — or complementary — theory of RNA origin is proposed in the [[PAH world hypothesis]], whereby [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s ([[PAHs]]) mediate the synthesis of RNA molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Platts, Simon Nicholas, [http://www.pahworld.com/ "The PAH World – Discotic polynuclear aromatic compounds as a mesophase scaffolding at the origin of life"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203045451/http://pahworld.com/ |date=2011-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PAHs are the most common and abundant of the known polyatomic molecules in the visible [[Universe]], and are a likely constituent of the [[primordial sea]].&lt;ref name=ames&gt;Allamandola, Louis et Al.

E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[iron-sulfur world theory]] proposes that simple metabolic processes developed before genetic materials did, and these energy-producing cycles catalyzed the production of genes.

Some of the difficulties of producing the precursors on earth are bypassed by another alternative or complementary theory for their origin, [[panspermia]]. It discusses the possibility that the earliest life on this planet was carried here from somewhere else in the galaxy, possibly on meteorites similar to the [[Murchison meteorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein MP, Sandford SA, Allamandola LJ, Gillette JS, Clemett SJ, Zare RN | title = UV irradiation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ices: production of alcohols, quinones, and ethers | journal = Science | volume = 283 | issue = 5405 | pages = 1135–8 | date = Feb 1999 | pmid = 10024233 | doi = 10.1126/science.283.5405.1135 | bibcode = 1999Sci...283.1135B }}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not invalidate the concept of an RNA world, but posits that this world or its precursors originated not on Earth but rather another, probably older, planet.

There are hypotheses that are in direct conflict to the RNA world hypothesis. The relative chemical complexity of the nucleotide and the unlikelihood of it spontaneously arising, along with the limited number of combinations possible among four base forms, as well as the need for RNA polymers of some length before seeing enzymatic activity, have led some to reject the RNA world hypothesis in favor of a metabolism-first hypothesis, where the chemistry underlying cellular function arose first, along with the ability to replicate and facilitate this metabolism.

=== RNA-peptide coevolution ===

Another proposal is that the dual-molecule system we see today, where a nucleotide-based molecule is needed to synthesize protein, and a peptide-based (protein) molecule is needed to make nucleic acid polymers, represents the original form of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunin V | title = A system of two polymerases--a model for the origin of life | journal = Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 459–66 | date = Oct 2000 | pmid = 11002892 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006672126867 | bibcode = 2000OLEB...30..459K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is called RNA-peptide coevolution,&lt;ref name="pascal"&gt;{{Citation | last = Pascal| first = Robert | contribution = A scenario starting from the first chemical building blocks| year = 2007 | title = From Suns to Life: A Chronological Approach to the History of Life on Earth | editor-last = Reisse | editor-first = Jacques | pages = 163–166 | publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media | isbn = 0-387-45083-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Peptide-RNA world, and offers a possible explanation for the rapid evolution of high-quality replication in RNA (since proteins are catalysts), with the disadvantage of having to postulate the coincident formation of two complex molecules, an enzyme (from peptides) and a RNA (from nucleotides).

== Implications of the RNA world ==
The RNA world hypothesis, if true, has important implications for the [[definition of life]]. For most of the time that followed [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]'s elucidation of DNA structure in 1953, life was largely defined in terms of DNA and proteins: DNA and proteins seemed the dominant macromolecules in the living cell, with RNA only aiding in creating proteins from the DNA blueprint.

The RNA world hypothesis places RNA at center-stage when life originated. The RNA world hypothesis is supported by the observations that ribosomes are ribozymes: the catalytic site is composed of RNA, and proteins hold no major structural role and are of peripheral functional importance. This was confirmed with the deciphering of the 3-dimensional structure of the ribosome in 2001. Specifically, peptide bond formation, the reaction that binds [[amino acid]]s together into [[protein]]s, is now known to be catalyzed by an adenine residue in the [[rRNA]].

RNAs are known to play roles in other cellular catalytic processes, specifically in the targeting of enzymes to specific RNA sequences.  In eukaryotes, the processing of [[pre-mRNA]] and [[RNA editing]] take place at sites determined by the base pairing between the target RNA and RNA constituents of [[snRNP|small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs)]].  Such enzyme targeting is also responsible for gene down regulation though [[RNA interference]] (RNAi), where an enzyme-associated guide RNA targets specific mRNA for selective destruction.  Likewise, in eukaryotes the maintenance of [[telomeres]] involves copying of an RNA template that is a constituent part of the [[telomerase]] ribonucleoprotein enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12304-008-9018-0|title=The Viral Origins of Telomeres and Telomerases and their Important Role in Eukaryogenesis and Genome Maintenance|journal=Biosemiotics|volume=1|issue=2|pages=191–206|year=2008|last1=Witzany|first1=Guenther | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another cellular organelle, the [[Vault (organelle)|vault]], includes a ribonucleoprotein component, although the function of this organelle remains to be elucidated.

[[File:Huck Finn Travelling by Rail.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the two con men being paraded on a rail in ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'']]
'''Riding the rail''' (also called being "run out of town on a rail") was a punishment most prevalent in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries in which an offender was made to straddle a fence rail held on the shoulders of two or more bearers.  The subject was then paraded around town or taken to the city limits and dumped by the roadside.  

Being ridden on a rail was typically a form of [[extrajudicial punishment]] administered by a mob, sometimes in connection with [[tarring and feathering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Farmer's Dictionary of Americanisms – Old and New|year=1889|publisher=Reeves and Turner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTdcQOlzjXAC&amp;dq=riding%20on%20a%20rail%20punishment&amp;pg=PA448#v=onepage&amp;q=riding%20on%20a%20rail%20punishment&amp;f=false|author=John S Farmer|accessdate=21 September 2010|location=London|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to show community displeasure with the offender so they either conformed their behavior to the mob's demands or left the community.

A story attributed to [[Abraham Lincoln]] has him quoting a victim of being ridden out of town on a rail as having said, "If it weren't for the honor of the thing, I'd just as soon it happened to someone else."&lt;ref name="Cuomo"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abraham Lincoln and Our "Unfinished Work" |first1=Governor Mario M. |last1=Cuomo |work=Journal of the [[Abraham Lincoln Association]] |volume=8 |issue= 1 |year=1986 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.2629860.0008.106 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{RPG}}
A '''role-playing game system''' is a set of [[game mechanics]] used in a [[role-playing game]] (RPG) to determine the outcome of a [[Player character|character]]'s in-game actions.

==History==
By the late 1970s, the [[Chaosium]] staff realized that [[Steve Perrin]]'s ''[[RuneQuest]]'' system had the potential to become a "house system", where one set of game mechanics could be used for multiple games; [[Greg Stafford]] and [[Lynn Willis]] proved that theory by boiling down the RuneQuest rules into the thin 16-page ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85}} [[Hero Games]] used their ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' rules as the basis for their [[Hero System]].&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|146}} The [[Pacesetter Ltd|Pacesetter]] house system centered on a universal "action table" that used one chart to resolve all game actions.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|197}} [[Steve Jackson (US game designer)|Steve Jackson]] became interested in publishing a new roleplaying system, designed by himself, with three goals: that it be detailed and realistic; logical and well-organized; and adaptable to any setting and any level of play; this system was eventually released as ''[[GURPS]]'' (1986).&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|104–107}} The ''D&amp;D''-derived [[Megaversal system|Palladium house system]] ultimately encompassed all of the [[Palladium Books]] titles.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|60}} ''[[Mekton|Mekton II]]'' (1987) by [[R. Talsorian Games]] revealed for the first time the full-fledged [[Interlock System]].&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|208}}

In 1990, [[Game Designers' Workshop]] released the ''[[Twilight: 2000]]'' second edition game system , and decided to turn it into their house system, an umbrella under which all future games would be designed.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|60}} [[TSR (company)|TSR]]'s ''[[Amazing Engine]]'' was a [[Generic role-playing game system|universal game system]], a simple beginner's system.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|27}} In 1996, Hero Games partnered with R. Talsorian and decided to create a new, simpler rules system to attract new players, merging it with the Interlock game system and calling it Fuzion.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|150}} ''[[Dragonlance: Fifth Age]]'' (1996) was built on TSR's new [[SAGA System|SAGA]] storytelling game system, which centered on resource management (through cards) rather than die rolls.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|29}} TSR published ''[[Alternity]]'' (1997), another universal system, this one directed only toward science-fiction games.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|29}} [[West End Games]]' MasterBook system had failed to catch on as a house system, so they decided to publish another, the [[D6 System]], based on their most well-known and well-tested game system, ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game|Star Wars]]'' RPG.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|194}}

==Development==
While early role-playing games relied heavily on either group consensus or the judgement of a single player (the "Dungeon Master" or [[Game Master]]) or on randomizers such as dice, later generations of [[narrativist]] games allow role-playing to influence the creative input and output of the players, so both acting out roles and employing rules take part in shaping the outcome of the game.

An RPG system also affects the game environment, which can take any of several forms. [[Generic role-playing game systems]], such as ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'', ''[[GURPS]]'', and ''[[Fate (role-playing game system)|Fate]]'', are not tied to a specific storytelling [[genre]] or [[campaign setting]] and can be used as a framework to play many different types of RPG.  Others, such as ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', are designed to depict a specific genre or style of play, and still others, such as ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'', are not only genre-specific but come bundled with a specific campaign setting to which the game mechanics are inseparably tied.  In fact, in more psychological games such as ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', ''[[King Arthur Pendragon]]'', ''[[Unknown Armies]]'', and ''[[Don't Rest Your Head]]'', aspects of the game system are designed to reinforce psychological or emotional dynamics that evoke a game world's specific atmosphere.

Many role-playing game systems involve the generation of random numbers by which success or failure of an action is determined.  This can be done using [[dice]] (probably the most common method) or [[Playing card|card]]s (as in ''[[Castle Falkenstein (role-playing game)|Castle Falkenstein]]''), but other methods may be used depending on the system. The random result is added to an '''[[attribute (role-playing games)|attribute]]''' which is then compared to a '''difficulty rating''', although many variations on this game mechanic exist among systems. Some (such as the ''[[Storyteller System|Storyteller]]''/''[[Storytelling System]]'' and the ''[[One-Roll Engine]]'') use [[dice pool]]s instead of individual dice to generate a series of random numbers, some of which may be discarded or used to determine the magnitude of the result.  However, some games (such as the ''[[Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game]]'' and ''[[Nobilis]]'') use no random factor at all. These instead use direct comparison of character ability scores to difficulty values, often supplemented with points from a finite but renewable pool.  These "resource points" represent a character's additional effort or luck, and can be used strategically by the player to influence the success of an action.

[[File:Gertrude Stein 1935-01-04.jpg|right|thumb|[[Gertrude Stein]], 1935]]
The sentence "'''Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.'''" was written by [[Gertrude Stein]] as part of the 1913 poem "Sacred Emily", which appeared in the 1922 book ''Geography and Plays''. In that poem, the first "Rose" is the name of a person. Stein later used variations on the sentence in other writings, and "'''A rose is a rose is a rose'''" is among her most famous quotations, often interpreted as meaning &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/15900.html] Meaning and Origin of this phrase &lt;/ref&gt; "things are what they are", a statement of the [[law of identity]], "A is A". In Stein's view, the sentence expresses the fact that simply using the name of a thing already invokes the imagery and emotions associated with it, an idea also intensively discussed in the [[problem of universals]] debate where [[Peter Abelard]] and others used the ''rose'' as an example concept. As the quotation diffused through her own writing, and the culture at large, Stein once remarked, "Now listen! I'm no fool. I know that in daily life we don't go around saying 'is a ... is a ... is a ...' Yes, I'm no fool; but I think that in that line the rose is red for the first time in [[English poetry]] for a hundred years." (''Four in America'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www2.english.uiuc.edu/finnegan/English%20256/gertrude_stein.htm|title=Gertrude Stein|website=Department of English|publisher=University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20030309141326/http://www2.english.uiuc.edu/finnegan/English%20256/gertrude_stein.htm|archivedate=9 March 2003|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She herself said to an audience at [[Oxford University]] that the statement referred to the fact that when the [[romanticism|Romantics]] used the word "rose", it had a direct relationship to an actual rose. For later periods in literature this would no longer be true. The eras following romanticism, notably the modern era, use the word rose to refer to the actual rose, yet they also imply, through the use of the word, the archetypical elements of the romantic era.

==Mentions of "rose" in "Sacred Emily"==
The following lines appear at widely separated places in "Sacred Emily":
* ''It is rose in hen.''
* ''Jack Rose Jack Rose.''
* ''Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.''

== Versions by Gertrude Stein ==
*"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose." ("Sacred Emily", ''Geography and Plays'')
*"Do we suppose that all she knows is that a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose." (''Operas and Plays'')
*"... she would carve on the tree Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose until it went all the way around." (''The World is Round'')
*"A rose tree may be a rose tree may be a rosy rose tree if watered." (''Alphabets and Birthdays'')
*"Indeed a rose is a rose makes a pretty plate...." (''Stanzas in Meditation'')
*"When I said.
:A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.
:And then later made that into a ring I made poetry and what did I do I caressed completely caressed and addressed a noun."  (''Lectures in America'')
*"Civilization begins with a rose.  A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose. It continues with blooming and it fastens clearly upon excellent examples."  (''As Fine as Melanctha'')
*"Lifting belly can please me because it is an occupation I enjoy.
:Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.
:In print on top." (''Bee Time Vine'')

== Variations by others ==
* "A rose is a rose is a rose" quasi-quotation from "Sacred Emily" was also inspiration and one of the meanings behind ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' book by [[Umberto Eco]].{{cn|date=October 2014}}
* "A rose is a rose is a rose" and variants has been contrasted with [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] "[[A rose by any other name would smell as sweet]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cMNix5ICLKAC&amp;pg=PA23 |title=Inner strengths |author=Claire Frederick, Shirley McNeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The sentence was heavily promoted by Stein's life partner [[Alice B. Toklas]]; for example, she sold plates with the sentence going all the way around.
* [[Robert Frost]] alludes to Stein's sentence in his poem "The Rose Family", from the [[1929 in literature|1929]] collection ''[[West-Running Brook]]''.
* The sentence was [[parody|parodied]] by [[Ernest Hemingway]] after a brief time in [[Paris]] seeking editorial suggestions for his writing: "a stone is a stein is a rock is a boulder is a pebble." This also appears in his [[1940 in literature|1940 novel]] ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', in which there is yet another parody: "a rose is a rose is an onion." After a (perhaps bitter) falling out, the sentence becomes, "a bitch is a bitch is a bitch is a bitch."
* The sentence appears in the [[1952 in film|1952]] [[musical film]] ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', in the musical number "Moses Supposes". While parodying a dialogue coach, the characters of Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown sing: "...A Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose is / A rose is what Moses supposes his toes is / Couldn't be a lily or a taffy daphi dilli / It's gotta be a rose cuz it rhymes with mose!"
* The sentence appears in the 1952 Charlie Chaplin film  [[Limelight_(1952_film)|''Limelight'']]. Chaplin's character expresses it as "The meaning of anything is merely other words for the same thing. After all, a rose is a rose is a rose. That's not bad. It should be quoted."
* [[Aldous Huxley]] paraphrases the quotation in his [[1954 in literature|1954]] book ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', writing "A rose is a rose is a rose. But these chair legs were chair legs were St. Michael and all angels."  In his [[1958 in literature|1958]] book, ''[[Brave New World#Brave New World Revisited|Brave New World Revisited]]'', Huxley also referenced the quotation, writing, "An apple is an apple is an apple, whereas the moon is the moon is the moon."
* [[William Carlos Williams]] in a poem "The Pink Locust", appearing in his 1955 collection ''[[Journey to Love (William Carlos Williams)|Journey to Love]]'', quotes "a rose is a rose/ is a rose" as emblematic of the poet's self-deprecation in relation to life. Williams regards the phrase as a slogan of poetic [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]], denying the value of the creative act: the poet feels impotent and recognizes in her art merely a banal repetition of the words we use every day to represent the unrepresentable richness of the natural world. But the following lines of the poem offer an alternative view, one which Williams re-affirmed throughout his career: "A rose ''is'' a rose/ and the poem equals it/ if it be well made."
* In the 1960 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' (and its [[1963 in film|1963]] [[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|film adaptation]]), the character of Albert Peterson refers to the saying in the song "Rosie", in which he sings, "Oh, I once heard a poem that goes / A rose is a rose is a rose / But I don't agree / Take it from me / There's one rose sweeter than any that grows!"
* In 1968, the Portuguese artist João Vieira (1934-2009) painted the oil on canvas Uma Rosa É [A Rose Is], a work later (1971) reproduced on the cover of Colóquio Artes, # 1, a prestigious cultural magazine issued by Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon.
* [[Rock band]] [[Henry Cow]] sings on their [[Legend (Henry Cow album)|debut album]] "But a rose is a rose is a rose / said the mama of dada as long ago as 1919".
* [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] said in 1981 that "A crime is a crime is a crime" in reference to the actions of members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. The sentence has been used by other speakers as well, with the intended meaning of "no matter what you call it, criminal violence is criminal, and illegal."
* In the 1978 film ''[[The Magic of Lassie]]'', [[Sherman Brothers|Robert and Richard Sherman]] penned the song, "A Rose Is Not a Rose".
* "Una rosa es una rosa es una rosa", the Spanish translation of Stein's verse, is the chorus of a song by the Spanish pop music group [[Mecano]] that appeared on their 1991 album, ''Aidalai''.  The pop-flamenco song tells the story of a man in love with a woman who by turns hurts and soothes him.
* [[Bret Easton Ellis]] sent up the sentence in his [[1991 in literature|1991]] [[novel]] ''[[American Psycho]]'', as narrator Patrick Bateman utters, "a Rolls is a Rolls is a Rolls" during one of his frequent materialist stream-of-consciousness tirades.
* ''[[A Rose is Still a Rose]]'' was the title of a [[1998 in music|1998]] album and song by [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Lauryn Hill]]. The song, written by Hill, also contains the refrain, "What I am is what I am."
* In the liner notes to the [[1999 in music|1999]] [[The Magnetic Fields]] album ''[[69 Love Songs]]'', frontman [[Stephin Merritt]] credited the sentence as an inspiration for the songs "The Things We Did and Didn't Do" and "The Flowers She Sent and the Flowers She Said She Sent".
* [[Idlewild (band)|Idlewild]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[rock music|rock]] band, wrote a song called "[[Roseability]]", which appeared on their [[2000 in music|2000]] album ''[[100 Broken Windows]]''. The song mentions Stein at the end of the chorus—"and Gertrude Stein said that's enough"—and features large portraits of Stein in the background of the [[music video]].
* The sentence is quoted by [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] in his [[2001 in literature|2001]] novel, ''[[Thinks ...]]'', in the context of a debate between the fictional characters of Arthur Messenger (a cognitive scientist) and Helen Reed (a novelist).
* [[James Tenney]] made a skillful if short setting of "Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" as a [[canon (music)|canon]] dedicated to [[Philip Corner]], beginning with an "a" on an [[upbeat]] rhythm and continuing so that each repetition shuffles the words, e.g. "a/rose is a rose/is a rose is/a rose is a/rose."
* [[Mordecai Richler]] in his novel ''[[Barney's Version (novel)|Barney's Version]]'' ridicules the stupidity of court speeches when the prosecutor ends his opening speech with "murder is murder is murder."
* [[Jeanette Winterson]] wrote in her novel ''Written on the Body'': "Sometimes a breast is a breast is a breast."
* "La rosa es una rosa es una rosa" is used in [[Fernando del Paso]]'s ''Sonetos con lugares comunes''.
* A song by [[Poe (singer)|Poe]] (Anne Danielewski), "A rose is a rose", states "a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose said my good friend Gertrude Stein."
* The computer game ''[[Carmen Sandiego]]'' features a villain humorously named Rosa Zarrosas-Arroz.
* Jeff Smith in the issue 13 of the ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' series, Fone Bone's love poems begin with "a rose is a rose is a rose".
* [[William Burroughs]] wrote a linguistic variant: "the word for word is word."
* The Italian rock band Long Hair in Three Stages use the variant "Rain is rain is rain is..." in a song called "Nothing" and then the original version by Stein, "A rose is a rose is a rose..." in a song called "Rose".
* In the late-1980s, an American [[public service announcement]] featured a message regarding identical alcohol content in three alcoholic drinks—a beer, a mixed drink, and a shot of whiskey—with the sentence "A drink is a drink is a drink."
* In the "[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 1)#Episodes|Misleader]]" seventeenth episode of the first season of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', the character [[Detective Munch]] says, "a rape is a rape is a rape", implying that the bizarre nature of the rape he was investigating did not change the fact that a rape had occurred and that rape is still illegal.
* In the English radio series ''[[My Word!]]'', [[Frank Muir]] was called on to explain the origin of the sentence. His explanation: Nero and Cicero had rose gardens next to each other. The tender of Nero's garden had a mishap and destroyed a whole row of roses. So he sneaked over to Cicero's garden, stole a row from there and replaced the ones missing in his master's garden. However, they were white, while the ones in Nero's garden were pink or "rose-colored". When Nero saw this he wrote a note to the gardener: "Our roses are rose. Is a row Cicero's?" He has also rendered it as "Arrows sees Harrow's Ciceros" in a spin-off book ''You Can't Have Your Kayak and Heat It''.
* [[Julio Cortázar]] wrote in his novel ''Rayuela'' "A es A, a rose is a rose is a rose, April is the cruellest month, cada cosa en su lugar y un lugar para cada rosa es una rosa es una rosa..."
* [[Stephen King]] refers to "A rose is a rose is a rose..." in his popular fantasy series ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''.

* South African bank [[Nedbank]] advertises with the slogan "A bank isn't a bank isn't a bank."
*[[Jonathan Safran Foer]] uses an altercation of the line "A rose is not a rose is not a rose!" and “A bullet’s a bullet’s a bullet!” in his 2003 book [[Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close|last=Safran Foer|first=Jonathan|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2003|isbn=9780547416212|location=|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 2005 ''[[House (TV series)|House M.D.]]'' episode "[[Three Stories (House)|Three Stories]]", Dr. House gives a lecture on diagnosing leg pain, and states that "Leg is a leg is a leg", whoever the patient.
* Massachusetts hardcore-punk act [[Bane (band)|Bane]] uses the motif,  "a lie is a lie is a lie is a lie" in "Her Lucky Pretty Eyes", from their 1999 record ''[[It All Comes Down to This (album)|It All Comes Down to This]]''.

{{Culture of Scotland}}
'''Scottish''' or '''Scots units of measurement''' are the '''weights and measures''' peculiar to [[Scotland]] which were nominally replaced by [[English units]] in 1685 but continued to be used in unofficial contexts until at least the late 18th century. The system was based on the [[ell]] ([[#Length|length]]), [[stone (Imperial mass)|stone]] ([[#Mass|mass]]), and [[:wikt:boll#Noun|boll]] and [[firlot]] ([[#Volume|volume]]). This official system coexisted with local variants, especially for the measurement of [[#Area|land area]].

The system is said to have been introduced by [[David I of Scotland]] (1124–53), although there are no surviving records until the 15th century when the system was already in normal use. Standard measures and weights were kept in each [[burgh]], and these were periodically compared against one another at "assizes of measures", often during the early years of the reign of a new monarch. Nevertheless, there was considerable local variation in many of the units, and the units of dry measure steadily increased in size from 1400 to 1700.&lt;ref name="Simpson"&gt;{{citation | last= Simpson |first=A.

The Scots units of length were technically replaced by the English system by an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in 1685,&lt;ref name="1685-4-83"&gt;"[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1685/4/83 Act for a standard of miles]" (16 June 1685). ''APS'' '''viii''': 494, c.59. ''RPS'' 1685/4/83.&lt;/ref&gt; and the other units by the [[Act of Union (1707)|Treaty of Union]] with England in 1706.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1706/10/257 Union with England Act 1707 (c.&amp;nbsp;7)], art.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; However many continued to be used locally during the 18th and 19th centuries. The introduction of the [[Imperial units|Imperial system]] by the [[Weights and Measures Act 1824]] saw the end of any formal use in trade and commerce, although some informal use as customary units continued into the 20th century. "Scotch measure" or "[[Clan Cunningham|Cunningham]] measure" was brought to parts of [[Ulster]] in Ireland by [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots settlers]], and used into the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=John Harwood|title=Plantation acres: an historical study of the Irish land surveyor and his maps|accessdate=15 May 2015|date=1985|publisher=Ulster Historical Foundation|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall1842"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Anna Maria|authorlink=Anna Maria Hall|title=Ireland: Its Scenery, Character, &amp;c|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbwTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=15 May 2015|year=1842|publisher=How and Parsons|pages=198, fn.|quote=We notice the Scotch acre, chiefly because it is the measure employed in some of the northern Irish counties.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Length==
;[[Ell#Ell (Scots)|ell]] : The ell ({{lang-la|ulna}}) was the basic unit of length, equal to 37&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1427/3/2 Act of 11 March 1427], ''RPS'' 1427/3/2.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Barony ell" of 42&amp;nbsp;inches was used as the basis for land measurement in the Four Towns area near [[Lochmaben]], Dumfriesshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The statistical account of Scotland | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fYXRAAAAMAAJ | author = Sinclair, John | location = Edinburgh | publisher = W.

==Area==
A number of conflicting systems were used for area, sometimes bearing the same names in different regions, but working on different conversion rates. Because some of the systems were based on what land would produce, rather than the physical area, they are listed in their own section. Please see individual articles for more specific information. Because fertility varied widely, in many areas, production was considered a more practical measure.

===Area by size===
''For information on the squared units, please see the appropriate articles in the length section''
*'''square inch'''
*'''square ell'''
*'''square fall''' (''faw'')
*'''[[Rood (Scots)|rood]]''' (''ruid'')
*'''[[Acre (Scots)|acre]]'''

===Area by production===
[[File:Oxgangs towards Comiston.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Oxgangs]], Edinburgh named after the Scottish unit.]]

Eastern Scotland:

* [[oxgang]] (''damh-imir'') = the area an ox could plough in a year (around 20 acres)
* [[ploughgate]] (''plougate'') = 8 oxgangs
* [[Davoch|dauch]] (''dabhach''/''davoch'') = 4 ploughgates

=== Area by taxation/rent ===
In western Scotland, including [[Galloway]]:
* [[Markland (Scots)|markland]] (''merkland'', ''marg-fhearann'') = 8 ouncelands (varied) 
* [[ounceland]] (''unceland'', ''tir-unga'') = 20 pennylands
* [[pennyland]] (''peighinn'') = basic unit; sub-divided into [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]]-land and [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]]-land &lt;!-- Based on quote/reference presented in Pennyland article. --&gt;
* (Other terms in use; [[quarterland]] (''ceathramh''): variable value; [[groatland]] (''còta bàn'')

==Volume==

===Dry volume===
Dry volume measures were slightly different for various types of grain, but often bore the same name.

*'''[[chalder]]''' (''chauder'')
*'''boll''' (''bowe'' / ''bole'') equal to 4 [[firlot]]s
*'''[[firlot]]'''
*'''[[peck]]''' 
*'''[[lippie]]''' or '''[[forpet]]'''

Weight equivalents of one  '''boll''' are given in a trade dictionary of 1863 as follows:
Flour 140 pounds;
Peas or beans 280 pounds;
Oats 264 pounds;
Barley 320 pounds;
Oatmeal 140 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simmonds|first1=P L|title=A dictionary of trade products, commercial, manufacturing, and technical terms: with a definition of the moneys, weights, and measures of all countries, reduced to the British standard|date=1863|publisher=Routledge, Warne &amp; Routledge|location=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/cihm_47512#page/n55/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluid volume===
Nipperkin was also used, but perhaps not part of this more formal set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nipperkin|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-nip1.htm|website=World Wide Words: Investigating the English language across the globe|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donn|first1=Benjamin|title=A new introduction to the mathematicks: being essays on vulgar and decimal Arithmetick (1858)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6o2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA146-IA1|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weight==
Weight was measured according to "troy measure" ([[Lanark]]) and "tron measure" ([[Edinburgh]]), which were standardised in 1661. In the Troy system these often bore the same name as imperial measures.

* '''drop''' (''drap'')
* '''ounce ''' (''unce'')
* '''pound''' (''pund'')
* '''stone''' (''stane'')

Various local measures all existed, often using local weighing stones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3304">{{more footnotes|date=March 2015}}'''Sortal''' is a concept that has been used by some philosophers in discussing issues of identity, persistence, and change. The simplest property of a sortal is that it can be counted, i.e., can take numbers as [[grammatical modifier|modifiers]]. For example, "pea" is a sortal in the sentence "I want two peas", whereas "water" is not a sortal in the sentence "I want water". Countability is not the only criterion. Thus "red thing" in the sentence "There are two red things on the shelf" is not treated as a sortal by some philosophers who use the term. There is disagreement about the exact definition of the term as well as whether it is applied to linguistic things (such as predicates or words), abstract entities (such as properties), or psychological entities (such as [[concept]]s).

==Differing perspectives==
According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', the sortal/nonsortal distinction can be characterized in at least six different ways. It is said that a sortal:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grandy|2007}}{{rp|para.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*gives a criterion for counting the items of that kind
*gives a criterion of identity and non-identity among items of that kind
*gives a criterion for the continued existence of an item of that kind
*answers the question "what is it?" for things of that kind
*specifies the essence of things of that kind
*does not apply to parts of things of that kind

==History==
While some philosophers have argued that the notion of a sortal is similar to that of the idea of a "[[secondary substance]]" in [[Aristotle]], the first actual use of the term 'sortal' did not appear until [[John Locke]] in his 1690 ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'':

{{quote |But it being evident, that things are ranked under Names into sorts or Species…the Essence of each Genus, or Sort, comes to be nothing but that abstract Idea, which the General, or Sortal (if I may have leave so to call it, from Sort, as I do General from Genus) Name stands for. And this we shall find to be that, which the word Essence imports, in its most familiar use. 
|Locke, Bk.III, Ch.III, 15}}

[[Gottlob Frege]] is also named as an antecedent to the present debate over sortals. Frege pointed out that in counting things, we need to know what kind of thing it is that we are counting; that is, there needs to be a "criterion of identity".

In [[contemporary philosophy]], sortals make a return with the work of [[P. F. Strawson]], [[W. V. O. Quine]], [[Peter Geach]], and [[David Wiggins]]. Strawson holds that sortals are universals, Quine thinks they are predicates, and Wiggins sees them as concepts. Geach did not use the exact term "sortal"; however, his idea of the "substantival expression" is identical or nearly so to that of "sortal".

A '''spatial distribution''' is the arrangement of a phenomenon across the [[Earth's surface]] and a [[graphical display]] of such an arrangement is an important tool in geographical and [[environmental statistics]]. A graphical display of a spatial distribution may summarize raw data directly or may reflect the outcome of more sophisticated [[data analysis]]. Many different aspects of a phenomenon can be shown in a single graphical display by using a suitable choice of different colours to represent differences.

One example of such a display could be observations made to describe the geographic patterns of features, both physical and human across the earth. 

The information included could be where units of something are, how many units of the thing there are per units of area, and how sparsely or densely packed they are from each other.

==Examples==
*Many police departments color-code a [[city map]] based on crime statistics.
*The [[two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method]] has been used to prepare maps showing the relative accessibility of individuals (demand units) to physicians (supply units), by shading which shows many different degrees of accessibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8647">'''Specification and Description Language''' ('''SDL''') is a [[specification language]] targeted at the unambiguous specification and description of the behaviour of reactive and distributed systems.

== Overview ==
The [[ITU-T]] has defined SDL in Recommendations Z.100 to Z.106. SDL originally focused on telecommunication systems; {{as of | 2016}} its current areas of application include process control and real-time applications in general. Due to its nature it can be used to represent simulation systems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38911-5_15
| title= Definition of Virtual Reality Simulation Models Using Specification and Description Language Diagrams
| publisher= [[Springer Berlin Heidelberg]]
| author= Fonseca i Casas, Pau and Pi, Xavier and Casanovas, Josep and Jové, Jordi 
| accessdate= 2014-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; without ambiguity and with a graphical notation.

The Specification and Description Language provides both a graphical ''Graphic Representation'' (SDL/GR) as well as a textual ''Phrase Representation'' (SDL/PR), which are both equivalent representations of the same underlying semantics. Models are usually shown in the graphical SDL/GR form, and SDL/PR is mainly used for exchanging models between tools. A system is specified as a set of interconnected abstract machines which are extensions of [[finite state machine]]s (FSM).

The language is [[Turing completeness|formally complete]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url= https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-71289-3_17
| title= SDL Profiles – Formal Semantics and Tool Support
| publisher= [[Springer Publishing|Springer]]
|author1 =R. Grammes |author2= R. Gotzhein 
| accessdate= 2014-08-27
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
so it can be used for code generation for either simulation or final targets.

The Specification and Description Language covers five main aspects: structure, communication, behavior, data, and inheritance.  The behavior of components is explained by partitioning the system into a series of hierarchies. Communication between the components takes place through gates connected by channels. The channels are of delayed channel type, so communication is usually asynchronous, but when the delay is set to zero (that is, no delay) the communication becomes synchronous.

The first version of the language was released in 1976 using graphical syntax (SDL-76). This was revised in 1980 with some rudimentary semantics (SDL-80). The semantics were refined in 1984 (SDL-84), the textual form was introduced for machine processing and data was introduced. In 1988, SDL-88 was released with a formal basis for the language: an abstract grammar as well as a concrete grammar and a full formal definition. The version released in 1992 (SDL-92) introduced object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, abstract generic types etc., with the object-oriented features described by transformations into non-object oriented ones. SDL-2010 is the latest version, an updated version of SDL-2000 that was completely based on object-orientation, rather than description by transformations. This version is accompanied by a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]-Profile: ITU-T Recommendation Z.109 (04/12), SDL-2010 combined with UML. SDL-2010 also introduced the support of C data types as initially introduced by SDL-RT.

== Organization ==

=== Hierarchy level ===
The Hierarchy level of SDL is structured as follows. 
*Library package
*System agent
*Block agent
*Process agent
*Procedure type
*Remote procedure

=== Architecture ===
An SDL system is made of functional blocks and each block can be further decomposed in sub-blocks. The lowest level block is composed of one or several process described as finite state machines.

[[Image:SdlArchitecture.JPG]]

=== Communication ===
Blocks are connected through channels that carry the messages (or signals) exchanged between the blocks. A block agent consists of process agents.

[[Image:SdlChannels.png]]

=== Behavior ===
Each process agent is a state machine that contributes to the action carried out by the system. A message stimulus coming from the environment or from another agent to an agent is called a signal. Signals received by a process agent are first placed in a queue (the input port). When the state machine is waiting in a state, if the first signal in the input port is enabled for that state it starts a transition leading to another state. Transitions can output signals to other agents or to the environment. A process agent is allowed to contain procedure types so that the same actions can be invoked from different places. It is also allowed to call a remote procedure type to invoke a procedure in another agent (or even another system) and wait for a response.

In this example MyVariable is of type INTEGER and is the only variable in the process. The first transition is the ''start'' transition that initializes the local variable. A connection request message ''conReq'' is sent, a 5 seconds timer ''conReqTimer'' is started, and the state machine goes to the ''connecting'' state. In the ''connecting'' state if the timer goes off -that is equivalent to a message receive- the connection request is sent again up to 10 times. If a connection confirmation is received the state machine goes to ''connected'' state. This is a typical telecommunication protocol scenario.

=== Data ===
SDL Abstract Data Types (ADT) support basic data types such as INTEGER, REAL, CHARSTRING as well as structured ones such as structures (STRUCT), enumerated (LITERALS), constants (SYNONYMS). Syntax looks like the one from Pascal, for example an assignment is written ':='.

== SDL tools ==
The most well-known SDL modelling tools are Telelogic Tau, PragmaDev Studio, Cinderella, Safire-SDL, and ObjectGeode (now out of the market). PragmaDev Studio supports both SDL and SDL-RT which is used to develop real-time and embedded software. There are also some open source projects relative to SDL modeling like JADE which is a Java-based specification environment, and OpenGEODE, a Python/Qt implementation of an SDL editor from the European Space Agency.

A '''specification language''' is a [[formal language]] in [[computer science]] used during [[systems analysis]], [[requirements analysis]] and [[systems design]] to describe a system at a much higher level than a [[programming language]], which is used to produce the executable code for a system.

Specification languages are generally not directly executed. They are meant to describe the ''what'', not the ''how''. Indeed, it is considered as an error if a requirement specification is cluttered with unnecessary implementation detail.

A common fundamental assumption of many specification approaches is that programs are modelled as [[algebra]]ic or [[model theory|model-theoretic]] structures that include a collection of [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of data values together with [[function (mathematics)|functions]] over those sets.  This level of abstraction coincides with the view that the correctness of the input/output behaviour of a program takes precedence over all its other properties.

In the ''property-oriented'' approach to specification (taken e.g. by [[Common Algebraic Specification Language|CASL]]), specifications of programs consist mainly of logical [[axiom]]s, usually in a [[logical system]] in which equality has a prominent role, describing the properties that the functions are required to satisfy - often just by their interrelationship.
This is in contrast to so-called [[model-based specification|model-oriented specification]] in frameworks like [[Vienna Development Method|VDM]] and [[Z notation|Z]], which consist of a simple realization of the required behaviour.

Specifications must be subject to a process of ''refinement'' (the filling-in of implementation detail) before they can actually be implemented. The result of such a refinement process is an executable algorithm, which is either formulated in a programming language, or in an executable subset of the specification language at hand. For example, [[Hartmann pipeline]]s, when
properly applied, may be considered a [[dataflow]] specification which ''is'' directly executable.  Another example is the [[Actor model]] which has no specific application content and must be ''specialized'' to be executable.

An important use of specification languages is enabling the creation of [[Mathematical proof|proof]]s of [[program correctness]] (''see [[Automated theorem prover|theorem prover]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10549">A '''sustainable development reserve''' ({{lang-pt|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentável}}, RDS) in Brazil is a type of [[Protected areas of Brazil|protected area]] inhabited by a traditional population that seeks to preserve nature while maintaining and improving the life of the population through [[sustainable development]].

==Background==

The concept of Sustainable Development Reserves originated in the Projeto Mamirauá launched in the early 1990s by the Sociedade Civil Mamirauá.
The project followed the principle of management based on scientific research and controlled use of natural resources.
The local population participates actively in the planning process and in responsible for managing and monitoring the area.
Key aspects are that the strategy can adapt to changes in the market, private property is maintained, plans are implemented to improve living conditions, and the local people partner with government agencies and NGOs to develop proposals for sustainable use.{{sfn|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável – Sociedade Civil Mamirauá}}

The [[Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve]] was established in 1996, the first such reserve in Brazil.{{sfn|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável – Sociedade Civil Mamirauá}}
The adjacent [[Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve]] was established in 1998 after the successful implementation of the Mamirauá reserve, and was fully supported by the local people.
They already recognized the importance of preserving the vegetation and animals that they depend upon for their livelihood.{{sfn|Luiz Claudio Marigo|1999}}
The new category of protected area was included in the National Protected Areas System (SNUG), which defined types of [[Protected areas of Brazil|protected area of Brazil]] in 2000.{{sfn|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável – Sociedade Civil Mamirauá}}

==Structure==

A Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS) holds traditional populations that live by sustainable exploitation of natural resources, developed over generations and adapted to the local ecology, and that protect nature and maintain biological diversity.
The goals are to preserve nature while preserving and improving the quality of life of the traditional populations, and to advance scientific knowledge and understanding of traditional techniques for managing the environment.{{sfn|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentáve – ISA}}

The land in an RDS is in the public domain, and may be expropriated.
Land use is regulated according to Law 9985 article 23 (2000) and in specific regulations.
A board of directors is chaired by the administrative agency and includes representatives of public bodies, civil society organizations and traditional populations living in the area.{{sfn|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentáve – ISA}}
A management plan is created by the administrative agency, which recognises the dynamic balance between conservation goals and the size of the population.
Natural ecosystems may be exploited sustainably, and cultivation of introduced species is allowed, subject to the management plan.
The plan defines areas where the ecology is fully protected, buffer zones, zones of sustainable use and ecological corridors.
Public visits to the RDS are allowed and encouraged where compatible with local interests and the management plan.
Scientific research and education with focus on conservation of nature are also encouraged.{{sfn|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentáve – ISA}}

[[Image:Palkhi 2008.jpg|thumb|A Varkari, carrying an ektari with a saffron flag attached and ''Chiplya'' [[cymbal]]s tied to strings in his hands, journeying from Alandi to Pandharpur]]

'''Varkari''' or '''Warkari'''(meaning "a pilgrim") is a [[sampradaya]] (religious movement) within the [[bhakti]] spiritual tradition of [[Vaishnavism]] part of [[Hinduism]], geographically associated with the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]]. Varkaris worship Vitthal (also known as [[Vithoba]]), the presiding deity of [[Pandharpur]], regarded as a form of [[Krishna]]. Saints and [[guru]]s of the [[bhakti movement]] associated with the Varkaris include [[Jñāneśvar]], [[Namdev]], [[Chokhamela]], [[Eknath]], and [[Tukaram]], all of whom are accorded the title of [[Sant (religion)|Sant]].

The Varkari movement includes the worship Vithoba and a duty-based approach towards life emphasising moral behavior and strict avoidance of [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]], the adoption of a strict [[lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]] diet and fasting on ''[[Ekadashi]]'' day (twice a month), self-restraint (''[[brahmacharya]]'') during [[student]] life, equality and humanity for all rejecting discrimination based on the [[caste system in India|caste system]] or wealth, the reading of [[Hindu texts]], the recitation of the ''[[Haripath]]'' every day and the regular practice of ''[[bhajan]]'' and ''[[kirtan]]''.

== Influence ==
The Varkari tradition has been part of Hindu culture in Maharashtra since the thirteenth-century CE, when it formed as a ''panth'' (community of people with shared spiritual beliefs and practices) during the [[Bhakti movement]]. Varkaris recognise around fifty poet-saints (''[[Sant (religion)|sant]]s'') whose works over a period of 500 years were documented in an eighteenth-century [[hagiography]] by [[Mahipati]]. The Varkari tradition regards these sants to have a common spiritual line of descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sants: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India |editor1-first=Karine |editor1-last=Schomer |editor2-first=W. H. |editor2-last=McLeod |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=1987 |isbn=9788120802773 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OkKhOivXrhgC |pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varkaris look upon God as the Ultimate Truth and ascertained grades of values in social life but accepted ultimate equality among men. Varkaris bow in front of each other because "everybody is Brahma" and stressed individual sacrifice, forgiveness, simplicity, peaceful co-existence, compassion, non-violence, love and humility in social life.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

The Varkari poets put God-realisation (''haripath'') in simple terms in small booklets of verse. Each saint extolled ''[[japa]]'', chanting the Lord's name. [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Namdev]], [[Eknath]], [[Tukaram]], [[Santaji Jagnade]], and other [[Marathi people|Marathi]] Bhakti saints of the sect tried to mould the attitude of the common people, which included low castes and women, to have a kind of detachment and the courage of one's convictions in the face of evil forces.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

==Pilgrimages==

Varkari people undertake an annual pilgrimage (''vari'') to Pandharpur, gathering there on ''Ekadashi'' (the 11th day) of the Hindu [[lunar calendar]] month of [[Ashadha]], corresponding to a date falling sometime between late June to July in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Pilgrims carry [[Pandharpur Wari|Palkhi]] of the saints from their places of ''[[Samadhi]]'' (Enlightenment or "spiritual birth"). The tradition of carrying the ''paduka'' (sandals) of the sants in a Palkhi was started by the youngest son of [[Tukaram]], Narayan Maharaj, in 1685. Further changes were brought to the pilgrimage by descendants of Tukaram in the 1820s and by Haibatravbaba, a courtier of the [[Scindia]]s and devotee of Dnyaneshwar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The wari tradition|url=http://www.warisantanchi.com/english/parampara2.html|website=Wari Santanchi|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mokashi|first1=Digambar Balkrishna|last2=Engblom|first2=Philip C (Translator)|title=Palkhi: An Indian Pilgrimage|date=1987|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0-88706-461-2|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-5vIv4oxeh4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotees of Vitthal were holding pilgrimages prior to the 14th century.In the present day,  about 40 palkhis and their devotees from all over Maharashtra do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/07/31/stories/2005073100130200.htm Hindu.com] and page 21 of [http://www.vidyaonline.net/arvindgupta/introhisddk.pdf VidyaOnline.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Another pilgrimage is celebrated on the ''Ekadashi'' of the month of [[Kartik (month)|Kartika]], which falls in November of the Gregorian Calendar.

Events such as ''Ringan'' and ''Dhava'' are held during the pilgrimage. During the ''Ringan'', an unmounted sacred horse called Maulincha Ashva, who is believed to be the soul of the saint whose idol is being carried in the litter, runs through the rows of pilgrims, who try catching the dust particles kicked off and smear their head with the same. ''Dhava'' is another kind of race where everyone wins and it is held to commemorate the manner in which Tukaram first saw the temple at Pandharpur and started running in sheer exhilaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mokashi|first1=Digambar Balkrishna|last2=Engblom|first2=Philip C (Translator)|title=Palkhi: An Indian Pilgrimage|date=1987|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0-88706-461-2|page=264|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-5vIv4oxeh4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lifestyle ==
Varkari wear tulasi-mala, a [[rosary]] made from ''[[Ocimum tenuiflorum]]''. They are lacto-vegetarians and follow a [[sattvic diet]]. Furthermore, like many other Vaishnava sects, they refrain from using onion and garlic in their cooking. Sect members also refrain from intoxicating substances such as alcohol.&lt;ref name="Reference is in Marathi language"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dikshit|first1=S H|title=Varkari|date=1971|publisher=Marathi Vishwakosh|location=Wai Maharashtra|url=http://marathivishwakosh.maharashtra.gov.in/khandas/khand16/index.php/23-2015-01-15-05-35-16/9948-2012-12-05-07-28-23?showall=1&amp;limitstart=|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2011, the day after Congress convened, Kaili Joy Gray of the liberal [[Daily Kos]] wrote an opinion piece titled "The Coming War on Women".&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Kaili Joy|title=The Coming War on Women|url=http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2011/01/03/coming-women|newspaper=Daily Kos|date=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, she outlined many of the measures that Republicans intended to push through the House of Representatives, including [[personhood]] laws, [[fetal pain]] laws, and the effort to defund Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt; In February 2011, an AlterNet article by Sarah Seltzer and Lauren Kelley entitled "9 New laws in the GOP's War on Women" &lt;ref name="Seltzer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Seltzer|first=Sarah|author2=Kelley, Lauren |title=9 New Laws in the GOP's War on Women|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/149761/9_new_laws_in_the_gop's_war_against_women|newspaper=AlterNet|date=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to document state-level legislation restricting abortion access and rights. That same month, New York Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]] referred to the proposed [[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]], one of the Congress's first actions and one that would have changed policy to allow only victims of "forcible rape" or child sex abuse to qualify for Medicaid funding for abortion, as "an entirely new front in the war on women and their families".&lt;ref name="Weigel"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weigel|first=David|title=The "War on Women" Is Over|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/hilary_rosen_ann_romney_the_birth_adolescence_and_death_of_the_democrats_war_on_women_talking_point_.single.html|newspaper=Slate|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida Representative and Chair of the [[Democratic National Committee]] [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] began using the term "War on Women" in March 2011.&lt;ref name="Weigel"/&gt;

=== Reproductive rights ===
[[Image:Guttmacher Abortion Restrictions.SVG|thumb|240px|Zerlina Maxwell, in an editorial for ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', cited these figures from the Guttmacher Institute as evidence of a "war on American women".&lt;ref name=fiction/&gt; The findings, according to the Guttmacher Institute, show that state restrictions on abortion greatly increased in 2011.&lt;ref name="Guttmacher2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guttmacher Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gold/&gt;]]
{{main|Reproductive rights}}
The "War on Women" slogan was used often when describing the unprecedented rise in the passage of provisions related to women's health and reproductive rights in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref name="Guttmacher2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guttmacher Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Policy Trends: Abortion and Contraception in the Crosshairs|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2012/04/13/index.html|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|date=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, state legislatures across the United States introduced over 1100 provisions related to women's health and reproductive rights,&lt;ref name="Guttmacher2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=States Enact Record Number of Abortion Restrictions in 2011|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2012/01/05/endofyear.html|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|date=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lithwick|first=Dahlia|title=The Faux Mommy Wars|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/04/presidential_election_season_conservatives_are_manufacturing_the_war_on_women_for_political_gain_.2.html|newspaper=Slate|date=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the first quarter of 2012 an additional 944 provisions were introduced in state legislatures, half of which would restrict access to abortion. Legislation has focused on mandatory ultrasounds, narrowing the time when abortions may be performed and limiting insurance coverage of abortion.&lt;ref name="Guttmacher Institute" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eckholm|first=Erik|title=Poll Finds Wide Support for Birth Control Coverage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/us/politics/americans-divided-on-birth-control-coverage-poll-finds.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic strategist [[Zerlina Maxwell]] wrote an editorial for ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' in which she cited a Guttmacher Institute analysis showing state legislatures enacted 135 pieces of legislation affecting women's reproductive rights as evidence that the "Republican 'War on Women' is no fiction."&lt;ref name=fiction&gt;{{cite news|last=Maxwell|first=Zerlina|title=Reproductive Health Laws Prove GOP 'War on Women' Is No Fiction|url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/is-there-a-republican-war-on-women/reproductive-health-laws-prove-gop-war-on-women-is-no-fiction|newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis found that between 2000 and 2011, the number of states hostile to [[abortion rights]] have increased markedly, and that in 2011 there was an unprecedented rise in the number of provisions passed by state legislatures restricting abortion.&lt;ref name=gold&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gold|first=Rachel Benson|author2=Nash, Elizabeth |title=Troubling Trend: More States Hostile to Abortion Rights as Middle Ground Shrinks|journal=Guttmacher Policy Review|date=Winter 2012|volume=15|issue=1|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/15/1/gpr150114.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states have adopted model legislation written by [[Americans United for Life]], a pro-life advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/magazine/the-reincarnation-of-pro-life.html | work=The New York Times | first=Emily | last=Bazelon | title=The Reincarnation of Pro-life | date=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/25/anti-abortion-group-womens-rights|title=Anti-abortion group drafting legislation to limit women's right to choose|author=Karen McVeigh|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, [[Charmaine Yoest]] and Denise M.

===== Mandatory ultrasounds =====
[[Image:Embryo at 14 weeks profile.JPG|thumb|right|Ultrasound of fetus at 14 weeks (profile)]]
In 2011 and 2012, "War on Women" was used to describe the legislation passed by many states requiring that women seeking abortions first undergo government-mandated [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terry-oneill/mandatory-ultrasound-laws_b_1300219.html|title=Mandatory Ultrasound Laws Violate Women's Rights and Bodies|publisher=The Huffington Post|first=Terry |last=O'Neill|date=Feb 2, 2012|accessdate=Dec 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states require that women view the image of the fetus and others [[Fetal heartbeat bill|require that women be offered the opportunity]] to listen to the fetal heartbeat. Since many women's pregnancies are not far enough along to get an image via a traditional ultrasound, [[transvaginal ultrasound]]s, which involve the physician inserting a probe into the woman's vagina, may be required, but these requirements vary state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_RFU.pdf | title=State Policies in Brief: Requirement for Ultrasound | website=[[Guttmacher Institute]] | date=1 January 2014 | accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/updates/2012/statetrends12012.html | title=Laws Affecting Reproductive Health and Rights: Trends in the First Quarter of 2012 | website=[[Guttmacher Institute]] | accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have questioned the value of having a medically unnecessary procedure, and characterized it as similar to some states' legal definition of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|title=When States Abuse Women|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/opinion/sunday/kristof-when-states-abuse-women.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Megan Carpentier underwent the procedure and indicated that although it was not comparable to being raped, the process was "uncomfortable to the point of being painful, emotionally triggering... and something that no government should force its citizens to undergo to make a political point."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carpentier|first=Megan|title=I had a transvaginal ultrasound: My perspective on the mandate that touched off 2012′s War On Women|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/17/i-had-a-transvaginal-ultrasound-my-perspective-on-the-mandate-that-touched-off-2012s-war-on-women/|newspaper=The Raw Story|date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowder|first=J.

In June 2013, Representative [[Trent Franks]] of Arizona, passed a national bill in the House Judiciary Committee that would ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy.

In April 2012, [[Arizona]] passed legislation banning abortions occurring 20 weeks after a woman's [[last menstrual period]]. A judge from the District Court initially upheld this ban, but the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled in August 2012 that the ban could not be enforced until an appeal on the law had been decided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/ninth-circuit-blocks-arizonas-20-week-abortion-ban-79380/ |title=Ninth Circuit Blocks Arizona's 20-Week Abortion Ban |publisher=Christian Post |date=2012-08-03 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ninth Circuit then struck down the law as unconstitutional in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santos|first=Fernanda|title=Arizona Law on Abortions Struck Down as Restrictive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/us/arizonas-ban-on-abortions-struck-down-in-federal-court.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight other states, including [[Nebraska]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LB1103 - Adopt the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act|url=http://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=10024|publisher=Nebraska Legislature|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alabama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative Detail: AL House Bill 18 - Regular Session 2011|url=http://legiscan.com/gaits/view/292139|publisher=LegiScan|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House Bill 954|url=http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb954.htm|publisher=Georgia General Assembly|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indiana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOUSE BILL No. 1127|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2012/IN/IN1127.1.html|publisher=in.gov|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Idaho&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Bill 1148|url=http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2011/S1148.htm|publisher=Idaho Legislature|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oklahoma,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Information for SB 1274|url=http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SB%201274|publisher=Oklahome State Legislature|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have passed such bills; unlike Arizona, the gestational age in these states is calculated from fertilization (20 weeks post-fertilization-which means 22 weeks LMP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eckholm|first=Erik|title=Lawsuit Tries to Block New Arizona Abortion Law|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/us/arizona-abortion-law-is-challenged.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Idaho's ban was struck down as unconstitutional by a federal judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zuckerman |first=Laura |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/03/07/us-usa-abortion-idaho-idINBRE92603L20130307 |title=Federal judge strikes down Idaho ban on late-term abortions |publisher=Reuters |date=2013-03-07 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; States such as [[Ohio]] have proposed so-called "heartbeat bills" that would prohibit abortions when the heartbeat of the fetus can be detected.

===== Defining the beginning of human personhood =====
{{main|Beginning of human personhood}}

In 2011, voters in Mississippi rejected Initiative 26, a measure that would have declared that human life begins at fertilization, which had drawn support from conservative Republicans and Democrats. Critics of the initiative indicated that the law would have made abortion illegal even in cases where the [[Abortion#Maternal and fetal health|mother's life]] is in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seelye|first=Katharine Q.|title=Mississippi Voters Reject Anti-Abortion Measure|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/us/politics/votes-across-the-nation-could-serve-as-a-political-barometer.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, South Dakota state legislators considered a bill that would expand that state's definition of justifiable homicide to include killings committed by a party other than a pregnant woman for the purpose of preventing harm to a fetus, a measure interpreted by critics as allowing the killing of abortion providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheppard|first=Kate|title=South Dakota Moves To Legalize Killing Abortion Providers|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/south-dakota-hb-1171-legalize-killing-abortion-providers|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar legislation was considered in Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheppard|first=Kate|title=Iowa Bills Could Also Allow for "Justifiable Homicide" Defense Against Abortion Docs|url=http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/02/iowa-bills-justifiable-homicide-abortion-docs|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several state legislatures have passed or are considering legislation to prevent parents from suing doctors who fail to warn them of fetal problems, which are sometimes known as [[wrongful birth]] lawsuits.

Sandra Fluke reading a prepared statement for U.S. Congressional testimony, 16 February 2012.]]
In February 2012, Republican Congressman [[Darrell Issa]] convened an all-male panel addressing religious freedom and [[contraceptive mandate]]s for health insurers. He did not allow [[Sandra Fluke]], a [[Georgetown University Law Center]] student who was proposed as a witness by the Democrats, to participate in the hearing, arguing that Fluke was not a member of the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rep.

Later that month, American [[Conservative talk radio|conservative talk-show]] host [[Rush Limbaugh]] [[Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy|controversially called Sandra Fluke a "slut" and "prostitute"]] and continued in similar fashion for the next two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Portero|first=Ashley|title=MoveOn Ad Uses Conservatives' Own Words In 'War On Women'|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/318306/20120322/moveon-ad-gop-war-against-women.htm|newspaper=International Business Times|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foster Friess]], the billionaire supporting the candidacy of [[Rick Santorum]], suggested in February 2012 that women put aspirin between their knees as a form of contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=James|first=Frank|title=Santorum Ally Friess Praises Old-School 'Contraceptive': Aspirin Between Knees|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/02/17/146999566/santorum-backer-friess-praises-old-school-contraceptive-aspirin|newspaper=NPR|date=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbaugh echoed the sentiment, saying he would "buy all of the women at Georgetown University as much aspirin to put between their knees as they want."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bassett|first=Laura|last2=Bendery|first2=Jennifer|title=Rush Limbaugh: I'll Buy Georgetown Women 'As Much Aspirin To Put Between Their Knees As They Want'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/01/rush-limbaugh-sandra-fluke_n_1313891.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nancy Pelosi]] circulated a petition and asked that Republicans in the House of Representatives disavow the comments by Friess and Limbaugh, which she called "vicious and inappropriate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geiger|first=Kim|title=Rush Limbaugh's 'slut' comment draws rebukes from all sides|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/02/news/la-pn-rush-limbaugh-draws-rebukes-from-all-sides-20120302|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Defunding Planned Parenthood ====
Several Democrats used the phrase ''War on Women'' to criticize the Republican Party after [[US House of Representatives|House]] Republicans passed legislation to cut off funding for [[Planned Parenthood]] in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nather|first=David|last2=Nocera|first2=Kate|title=House votes to defund Planned Parenthood|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/49830.html|newspaper=Politico|date=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas, Indiana and Kansas have passed legislation in an effort to defund the organization. Arizona, Ohio and New Hampshire are considering similar legislation.

On January 31, 2012, breast cancer organization [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]] stopped funding Planned Parenthood, citing a congressional investigation by Rep.

==== Defunding international family planning ====
The [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), in the U.S., in 2011, stated its opinion that "the 'war on women' isn't restricted to U.S. women",&lt;ref name="IntntlWDaNOWCallEndWarWStmtPres" /&gt; saying that the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] planned to "cut&amp;nbsp;... international family planning assistance....

In January 2011, the [[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]] moved to change how [[rape]] is treated when used to determine whether abortions qualify for Medicaid funding.

In April 2012, [[Governor of Wisconsin|Governor]] [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]]'s repeal of Wisconsin's ''Equal Pay Enforcement Act'' was described by opponents as furthering the "War on Women", which became a big issue in his recall election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/17/scott-walker-recall-war-women_n_1431143.html|title=Scott Walker Recall: 'War On Women' Fight Becomes Big Issue In Election|publisher=The Huffington Post| date=April 17, 2012|first=Amanda|last=Terkel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Equal Pay Enforcement Act'' was passed in 2009 in response to the large gap between the wages of men and women in Wisconsin.

== Public opinion ==
A May 2012 [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] poll found that 31 percent of women and 28 percent of men believed there was an ongoing and wide-scale effort to "limit women's reproductive health choices and services".&lt;ref name="huffpo1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kaiser1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8315-f.pdf | title=Kaiser Health Tracking Poll | publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] | date=May 2012 | accessdate=27 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 45 percent of women and 44 percent of men responded that some groups would like to limit these choices and services, but it's not wide‐scale.&lt;ref name="kaiser1"/&gt; Democrats were more likely than Republicans to say there is a movement, but the largest gap was between liberal and conservative ideologies.&lt;ref name="kaiser1"/&gt; Among those women believing these efforts to be wide-scale, 75 percent saw this as "a bad thing" against 16 percent who saw this as "a good thing".&lt;ref name="kaiser1"/&gt; In the same poll, 42 percent of women and men have said they have taken some action in response to what they heard regarding reproductive health issues.&lt;ref name="huffpo1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kaiser1"/&gt;

"A myopic focus on reproductive freedom and the 'War on the Women' does not seem to be an effective way to mobilize and motivate women in a year when the economy and jobs are at the forefront of voters' minds, and GOP candidates have not made the same kinds of mistakes that Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock did in 2012," says Jennifer Lawless, director of American University's Women &amp; Politics Institute.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/11/05/how-mark-uterus-lost-in-colorado/|title=How 'Mark Uterus' lost in Colorado|date=5 Nov 2014|author=Nia-Malika Henderson|website=Washington Post|quote=For the "war on women" message to actually be effective for Democratic candidates, one key thing has to happen: Women have to show up and vote for Democrats in larger numbers than men.

[[Donald Trump]], a [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican candidate for the 2016 Presidency]] attended a Fox News debate in August 2015, where [[Megyn Kelly]] asked him about how he would respond to a [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Hillary Clinton campaign]] saying that he was waging a "war on women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOqtra7j6UM|title=Is Donald Trump part of the 'war on women'? - Fox News Republican Debate|date=August 6, 2015|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/07/us-usa-election-trump-women-idUSKCN0QC04W20150807|title=Trump draws boos as he bristles at 'war on women' question|website=Reuters|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview with [[Don Lemon]] on ''[[CNN Tonight]]'', Trump said that Kelly is a "lightweight" and had "blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/08/politics/donald-trump-cnn-megyn-kelly-comment/index.html|title=Trump draws outrage after Megyn Kelly remarks - CNNPolitics.com|author=Holly Yan, CNN|date=August 8, 2015|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33833516|title=Donald Trump axed from event over Megyn Kelly blood comment|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump tweeted that his remark referred to Kelly's "nose" but was interpreted by critics as a reference to [[menstruation]].

== Reaction ==

=== Response from Republicans ===
Critics of the term have denied that a War on Women exists and some have suggested that it is a ploy to influence women voters. [[Reince Priebus]], the Chairman of the [[Republican National Committee|RNC]], referred to the War as a "fiction", saying "If the Democrats said we had a war on caterpillars and every mainstream media outlet talked about the fact that Republicans have a war on caterpillars, then we'd have problems with caterpillars."&lt;ref name="caterpillars"&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=David|title=RNC chair: GOP 'war on women' fictional like 'war on caterpillars'|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/05/rnc-chair-gop-war-on-women-fictional-like-war-on-caterpillars/|newspaper=The Raw Story|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benen|first=Steve|title=RNC chairman reflects on women, caterpillars|url=http://maddowblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/05/11035818-rnc-chairman-reflects-on-women-caterpillars|newspaper=The Maddow Blog|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jensen|first=Kristin|title=Priebus Says Gender Battle Fictional as Caterpillar War|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-05/priebus-says-gender-battle-as-fictonal-as-caterpillar-war|newspaper=Businessweek|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican Representative [[Cathy McMorris Rodgers]] called the war a myth, saying "It's an effort to drive a political wedge in an election year." Referring to the 2010 elections and [[Nancy Pelosi]], she said that "It could be argued that the women actually unelected the first woman Speaker of the House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dennis|first=Steven T.|title=Hill Women Play Starring Role in 'Mommy Wars'|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/hill-women-play-starring-role-mommy-wars-213960-1.html?pos=htmbtxt|newspaper=Roll Call|date=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/18/us-usa-campaign-rodgers-idUSBRE84H0YD20120518|title=Top Republican woman in Congress becomes a force|website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina Governor [[Nikki Haley]] said in 2012 "There is no war on women.

Senator [[John McCain]], when asked by journalist [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] if there was a Republican War on Women, said "I think that there is a perception out there because of how this whole contraception issue played out — ah, we need to get off of that issue, in my view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Kathleen|title=McCain decries GOP fight against Obama mandate: 'we need to get off that issue'|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/mccain-decries-gop-fight-against-obama-mandate-we-need-to-get-off-that-issu/|newspaper=LifeSiteNews.com|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican Senator [[Lisa Murkowski]] countered the criticism from her fellow party members, challenging them to "go home and talk to your wife and your daughters" if they did not think there was a war on women, saying "It makes no sense to make this attack on women."&lt;ref name="Murkowski"/&gt;

After the [[Rape and pregnancy controversies in United States elections, 2012|2012 rape and pregnancy controversies]], Republican strategists met with aides of Republican figures to advise them on how to run against female candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/gop-men-tutored-in-running-against-women-100701|title=GOP men told how to talk to women|author=Anna Plamer|date=12 May 2013|website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/gop-war-on-women-105453|author=Anna Palmer|date=4 Aug 2014|title=GOP solution to 'war on women'|website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democratic sexual harassment scandals ===
Members of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], both prominent and local, have been accused of participating in the war on women. In a column for ''[[USA Today]]'', [[Glenn Reynolds]] wrote in July 2013 that "most of the action in the war on women seems to be coming from the Democratic front," referring to the allegations of sexual harassment against [[San Diego]] mayor [[Bob Filner#Allegations of sexual harassment|Bob Filner]], the [[Anthony Weiner sexting scandal]], and the [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;''USA Today'': [https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/07/29/women-harassment-filner-weiner-sydney-leathers-column/2594213/ The latest in the war on women]. July 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republican National Senatorial Committee]] has also used these scandals in press releases, tying Democratic Senators in [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]] to the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;NRSC Press Release: [http://www.iowagop.org/war-on-women-bruce-braley-silent-as-fellow-democrats-mistreat-women/ Republican Party of Iowa].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''NH Journal'': [http://nhjournal.com/2013/07/23/nrsc-dings-shaheen-over-war-on-women/ NRSC dings Shaheen over 'war on women'.] July 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The messaging from Republicans was described as unlikely to be effective by Garance Franke-Ruta in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' because "[the War on Women] was an argument about Republican policies on women ... rather than about reprehensible individual behavior." Noting that many of the targets are not on upcoming ballots, Franke-Ruta continued by saying the Republican Party "is going to need its own pro-active framework for thinking about what is happening in America and why women have been drawn to Democrats in numbers that matter in key elections."&lt;ref name="Atlantic" /&gt;

=== Other reactions ===
[[Jonathan Alter]] characterized the phrase as an "alliteratve but unfair notion".&lt;ref&gt;Alter, Jonathan, ''The Center Holds: Obama and His Enemies'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1st Simon &amp; Schuster hardcover ed. 2013 ({{ISBN|978-1-4516-4607-8}})), p.&amp;nbsp;281 (author columnist, ''Bloomberg Voice'', analyst &amp; contributing ed., NBC News &amp; MSNBC, &amp; former sr. ed. &amp; columnist, ''Newsweek'').&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Weigel]] called for "a moment of silence" in his article entitled "The 'War on Women' Is Over: The life cycle of a political talking point, from birth to adolescence to death." In it he explained his understanding of the stages in the "life cycle" of the Democratic "talking point".&lt;ref name="Weigel" /&gt;

Molly Redden wrote an article for ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' entitled "The War on Women is Over -- and Women Lost". She described the difficulties faced by abortion providers: "Activists have been calling it the 'war on women.' But the onslaught of new abortion restrictions has been so successful, so strategically designed, and so well coordinated that the war in many places has essentially been lost."&lt;ref name=Redden &gt;{{Citation | last =Redden | first =Molly | author-link = | date=September 1, 2015 |title=The War on Women is Over -- and Women Lost.

The '''war on drugs''' is a campaign, led by the [[U.S. federal government]], of [[prohibition of drugs|drug prohibition]], [[military aid]], and [[military intervention]], with the stated aim being to reduce the [[illegal drug trade]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/03/27/472023148/legalize-all-drugs-the-risks-are-tremendous-without-defining-the-problem|title=Legalize All Drugs?

The term was popularized by the media shortly after a press conference given on June 18, 1971, by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]—the day after publication of a special message from President Nixon to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control—during which he declared drug abuse "public enemy number one". That message to the Congress included text about devoting more federal resources to the "prevention of new addicts, and the rehabilitation of those who are addicted", but that part did not receive the same public attention as the term "war on drugs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3048|title=Richard Nixon: Special Message to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nixon Calls War on Drugs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nixon Calls War on Drugs|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-5IjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RLcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=973,31915&amp;dq=nixon+war+on+drugs&amp;hl=en|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|date=June 18, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dufton|first=Emily|title=The War on Drugs: How President Nixon Tied Addiction to Crime|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/03/the-war-on-drugs-how-president-nixon-tied-addiction-to-crime/254319/|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two years prior to this, Nixon had formally declared a "war on drugs" that would be directed toward eradication, interdiction, and incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;Payan, Tony (2013).

On May 13, 2009, [[Gil Kerlikowske]]—the Director of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] (ONDCP)—signaled that the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] did not plan to significantly alter drug enforcement policy, but also that the administration would not use the term "War on Drugs", because Kerlikowske considers the term to be "counter-productive".&lt;ref name="WSJCZAR"&gt;{{Cite news|title=White House Czar Calls for End to 'War on Drugs' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124225891527617397|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 14, 2009|accessdate=May 14, 2009 | first=Gary | last=Fields}}&lt;/ref&gt; ONDCP's view is that "drug addiction is a disease that can be successfully prevented and treated... making drugs more available will make it harder to keep our communities healthy and safe".&lt;ref name="dup2"/&gt; One of the alternatives that Kerlikowske has showcased is the [[drug policy of Sweden]], which seeks to balance public health concerns with opposition to [[drug legalization]].

=== 20th century ===
The first U.S. law that restricted the distribution and use of certain drugs was the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914. The first local laws came as early as 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heroin/etc/history.html |title=Opium Throughout History |publisher=PBS Frontline |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, the United States passed the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]], prohibiting the sale, manufacture, and transportation of [[ethanol|alcohol]], with exceptions for religious and medical use. In 1920, the United States passed the [[National Prohibition Act]] (Volstead Act), enacted to carry out the provisions in law of the 18th Amendment.

The [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] was established in the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] by an act of June 14, 1930 (46 Stat. 585).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/170.html#170.3 |title=Records of the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, [[Prohibition in the United States|the federal prohibition for alcohol]] was repealed by passage of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]]. In 1935, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] publicly supported the adoption of the [[Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' used the headline "Roosevelt Asks Narcotic War Aid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/History/e1930/rooseveltasks.htm |title=ROOSEVELT ASKS NARCOTIC WAR AID, 1935 |publisher=Druglibrary.net |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15024 |title=Letter to the World Narcotic Defense Association.

In 1937, the [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937]] was passed.

On October 27, 1970, Congress passed the [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970]], which, among other things, categorized controlled substances based on their medicinal use and potential for addiction.&lt;ref name="frontline" /&gt; In 1971, two congressmen released an explosive report on the growing heroin epidemic among U.S. servicemen in Vietnam; ten to fifteen percent of the servicemen were addicted to heroin, and President Nixon declared drug abuse to be "public enemy number one".&lt;ref name="frontline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dupoint"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/dupont.html WGBH educational foundation.

The Nixon Administration also repealed the federal 2–10-year [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentences]] for  possession of marijuana and started federal demand reduction programs and drug-treatment programs.

The [[Global Commission on Drug Policy]] released a report on June 2, 2011, alleging that "The War On Drugs Has Failed." The commissioned was made up of 22 self-appointed members including a number of prominent international politicians and writers. U.S. Surgeon General [[Regina Benjamin]] also released the first ever National Prevention Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthcare.gov/center/councils/nphpphc/strategy/index.html National Prevention Strategy, June 16, 2011].

Whitehouse.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; The director of [[ONDCP]] stated simultaneously that this policy is something different from the "War on Drugs":
* The U.S. Government sees the policy as a "third way" approach to drug control; an approach that is based on the results of a huge investment in research from some of the world's preeminent scholars on disease of substance abuse.
* The policy does not see drug legalization as the "silver bullet" solution to drug control.
* It is not a policy where success is measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/news-releases-remarks/principles-of-modern-drug-policy-directors-remarks-at-the-world-federation-against-drugs Statement of the Government of the United States of America World Federation Against Drugs 3rd World Forum, May 21, 2012, Stockholm, Sweden].

The present state of incarceration in the U.S. as a result of the war on drugs arrived in several stages. By 1971, different stops on drugs had been implemented for more than 50 years (for e.g. since 1914, 1937 etc.) with only a very small increase of inmates per 100,000 citizens.
During the first 9 years after Nixon coined the expression "War on Drugs", statistics showed only a minor increase in the total number of imprisoned.

After 1980, the situation began to change. In the 1980s, while the number of arrests for all crimes had risen by 28%, the number of arrests for drug offenses rose 126%.&lt;ref&gt;Austin J, McVey AD. The 1989 NCCD prison population forecast: the impact of the war on drugs.

In addition to prison or jail, the United States provides for the deportation of many non-citizens convicted of drug offenses.&lt;ref&gt;[Gabriel J.

===Sentencing disparities===
In 1986, the U.S. Congress passed laws that created a 100 to 1 sentencing disparity for the trafficking ''or possession'' of [[crack cocaine|crack]] when compared to penalties for ''trafficking'' of [[cocaine|powder cocaine]],&lt;ref name="wa-post-dispar-2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Congress passes bill to reduce disparity in crack, powder cocaine sentencing|author=Jim Abrams|work=Washington Post|date=July 29, 2010|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/28/AR2010072802969.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="celling-america-246-247"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gates-of-injustice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = United States Sentencing Commission | title = Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy | year = 2002 | page = 6 | url = http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/02crack/2002crackrpt.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070715212213/http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/02crack/2002crackrpt.pdf | archivedate = July 15, 2007 | accessdate=August 24, 2010 | quote = As a result of the 1986 Act ... penalties for a first-time cocaine trafficking offense: 5 grams or more of crack cocaine = five-year mandatory minimum penalty}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been widely criticized as discriminatory against minorities, mostly blacks, who were more likely to use crack than powder cocaine.&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/02/AR2010080204360.html "The Fair Sentencing Act corrects a long-time wrong in cocaine cases"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 3, 2010.

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], crime statistics show that—in the United States in 1999—compared to non-minorities, African Americans were far more likely to be arrested for drug crimes, and received much stiffer penalties and sentences.&lt;ref name="hrw-race-summary-recommendations"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2000/usa/Rcedrg00.htm#P54_1086|title=I.

Statistics from 1998 show that there were [[Race and the War on Drugs|wide racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions, sentencing and deaths]]. African-American drug users made up for 35% of drug arrests, 55% of convictions, and 74% of people sent to prison for drug possession crimes.&lt;ref name="celling-america-246-247"&gt;Burton-Rose (ed.), 1998: pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide African-Americans were sent to state prisons for drug offenses 13 times more often than other races,&lt;ref name="hrw-race-key-findings"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/drugs/war/key-facts.htm|title=Key Findings at a Glance|website=Racial Disparities in the War on Drugs|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though they only supposedly comprised 13% of regular drug users.&lt;ref name="celling-america-246-247" /&gt;
[[File:Marion Barry smoking crack.gif|thumb|right|D.C. Mayor [[Marion Barry]] captured on a surveillance camera smoking crack cocaine during a sting operation by the [[FBI]] and [[D.C. Police]].]]
Anti-drug legislation over time has also displayed an apparent racial bias. University of Minnesota Professor and social justice author [[Michael Tonry]] writes, "The War on Drugs foreseeably and unnecessarily blighted the lives of hundreds and thousands of young disadvantaged black Americans and undermined decades of effort to improve the life chances of members of the urban black underclass."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tonry, Malign Neglect – Race Crime and Punishment in America (London: Oxford University Press, 1995), 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] decided that the government needed to make an effort to curtail the social unrest that blanketed the country at the time. He decided to focus his efforts on illegal drug use, an approach which was in line with expert opinion on the subject at the time. In the 1960s, it was believed that at least half of the crime in the U.S. was drug related, and this number grew as high as 90 percent in the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;James Inciardi, ''The War on Drugs'' IV, ed. 4. (Delaware: Pearson Allyn and Bacon, 2008), 286.&lt;/ref&gt; He created the Reorganization Plan of 1968 which merged the Bureau of Narcotics and the Bureau of Drug Abuse to form the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs within the Department of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew B. Whitford and Jeffrey Yates, ''Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief during this time about drug use was summarized by journalist [[Max Lerner]] in his work ''America as a Civilization'' (1957):

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a case in point we may take the known fact of the prevalence of reefer and dope addiction in Negro areas. This is essentially explained in terms of poverty, slum living, and broken families, yet it would be easy to show the lack of drug addiction among other ethnic groups where the same conditions apply.&lt;ref&gt;Inciardi. ''The War on Drugs IV'', 248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969, and did not back away from the anti-drug precedent set by Johnson. Nixon began orchestrating drug raids nationwide to improve his "watchdog" reputation. Lois B. Defleur, a social historian who studied drug arrests during this period in Chicago, stated that, "police administrators indicated they were making the kind of arrests the public wanted". Additionally, some of Nixon's newly created drug enforcement agencies would resort to illegal practices to make arrests as they tried to meet public demand for arrest numbers. From 1972 to 1973, the Office of Drug Abuse and Law Enforcement performed 6,000 drug arrests in 18 months, the majority of the arrested black.&lt;ref&gt;Whitford and Yates. ''Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda'' 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The next two Presidents, [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]], responded with programs that were essentially a continuation of their predecessors. Shortly after [[Ronald Reagan]] became President in 1981 he delivered a speech on the topic. Reagan announced, "We're taking down the surrender flag that has flown over so many drug efforts; we're running up a battle flag."&lt;ref&gt;Whitford and Yates. ''Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda'', 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, driven by the 1986 cocaine overdose of black basketball star [[Len Bias]],{{dubious|date=February 2014}} Reagan was able to pass the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986|Anti-Drug Abuse Act]] through Congress. This legislation appropriated an additional $1.7 billion to fund the War on Drugs. More importantly, it established 29 new, mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. In the entire history of the country up until that point, the legal system had only seen 55 minimum sentences in total.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Ventura. ''American Conspiracies'' (New York: Skyshore Publishing, 2010), 117.&lt;/ref&gt; A major stipulation of the new sentencing rules included different mandatory minimums for powder and crack cocaine. At the time of the bill, there was public debate as to the difference in potency and effect of powder cocaine, generally used by whites, and crack cocaine, generally used by blacks, with many believing that "crack" was substantially more powerful and addictive. Crack and powder cocaine are closely related chemicals, crack being a smokeable, [[Free base|freebase]] form of powdered cocaine hydrochloride which produces a shorter, more intense high while using less of the drug. This method is more cost effective, and therefore more prevalent on the inner-city streets, while powder cocaine remains more popular in white suburbia. The Reagan administration began shoring public opinion against "crack", encouraging DEA official Robert Putnam to play up the harmful effects of the drug. Stories of "crack whores" and "crack babies" became commonplace; by 1986, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' had declared "crack" the issue of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Alexander. ''[[The New Jim Crow]]: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness''. (New York: The New Press, 2010), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Riding the wave of public fervor, Reagan established much harsher sentencing for crack cocaine, handing down stiffer felony penalties for much smaller amounts of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;Whitford and Yates. ''Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan protégé and former Vice-President George H. W. Bush was next to occupy the oval office, and the drug policy under his watch held true to his political background. Bush maintained the hard line drawn by his predecessor and former boss, increasing narcotics regulation when the First National Drug Control Strategy was issued by the Office of National Drug Control in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Tonry. ''Malign Neglect – Race, Crime and Punishment in America'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next three presidents – Clinton, Bush and Obama – continued this trend, maintaining the War on Drugs as they inherited it upon taking office.&lt;ref&gt;Whitford and Yates. Presidential Rhetoric and the Public Agenda. 72&lt;/ref&gt; During this time of passivity by the federal government, it was the states that initiated controversial legislation in the War on Drugs. Racial bias manifested itself in the states through such controversial policies as the "stop and frisk" police practices in New York city and the "three strikes" felony laws began in California in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Alexander. ''The New Jim Crow – Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness'', 92&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, President Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act into law that dramatically reduced the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine, which disproportionately affected minorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN01789:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp; Bill Summary &amp; Status – 111th Congress (2009–2010) – S.1789 – All Information – THOMAS (Library of Congress)]. Thomas.loc.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commonly used illegal drugs==
Commonly used illegal drugs include [[heroin]], [[cocaine]], [[methamphetamine]], and, [[marijuana]].

Heroin is an [[opiate]] that is highly addictive. If caught selling or possessing heroin, a perpetrator can be charged with a [[felony]] and face two–four years in prison and could be fined to a maximum of $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Possession of Heroin|url=http://www.criminalattorney.com/heroin/possession/|website=Criminal Attorney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crystal meth]] is composed of methamphetamine hydrochloride. It is marketed as either a white powder or in a solid (rock) form. The possession of crystal meth can result in a punishment varying from a fine to a jail sentence. As with other drug crimes, sentencing length may increase depending on the amount of the drug found in the possession of the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Possession of Crystal Meth|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/crystal-meth-possession.htm|website=The Criminal Defense Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocaine possession is illegal across the U.S., with the cheaper [[crack cocaine]] incurring even greater penalties. Having possession is when the accused knowingly has it on their person, or in a backpack or purse. The possession of cocaine with no prior conviction, for the first offense, the person will be sentenced to a maximum of one year in prison or fined $1,000, or both. If the person has a prior conviction, whether it is a [[narcotic]] or cocaine, they will be sentenced to two years in prison, a $2,500 fine, or both. With two or more convictions of possession prior to this present offense, they can be sentenced to 90 days in prison along with a $5,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cocaine Possession|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/crime-penalties/cocaine-possession.htm|website=The Criminal Defense Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marijuana is the most popular illegal drug worldwide. The punishment for possession of it is less than for the possession of cocaine or heroin. In some U.S. states, the drug is legal. Over 80 million Americans have tried marijuana. The ''Criminal Defense Lawyer'' article claims that, depending on the age of person and how much the person has been caught for possession, they will be fined and could plea bargain into going to a treatment program versus going to prison. In each state the convictions differ along with how much marijuana they have on their person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marijuana Possession|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/Marijuana-Possession.htm|website=The Criminal Defense Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States foreign policy and covert military activities==
Some scholars have claimed that the phrase "War on Drugs" is propaganda cloaking an extension of earlier military or paramilitary operations.&lt;ref name="Bullington 1990 39–55"/&gt; Others have argued that large amounts of "[[war as metaphor|drug war]]" foreign aid money, training, and equipment actually goes to fighting leftist insurgencies and is often provided to groups who themselves are involved in large-scale narco-trafficking, such as corrupt members of the Colombian military.&lt;ref name="whiteout-chapter-14"/&gt;

===War in Vietnam===
From 1963 to the end of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1975, marijuana usage became common among U.S. soldiers in non-combat situations. Some servicemen also used heroin. Many of the servicemen ended the heroin use after returning to the United States but came home addicted. In 1971, the U.S. military conducted a study of drug use among American servicemen and women. It found that daily usage rates for drugs on a worldwide basis were as low as two percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Alan|title=Preliminary Findings from the 1971 DoD Survey of drug Use|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0743852|publisher=Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the spring of 1971, two congressmen released an alarming report alleging that 15% of the servicemen in Vietnam were addicted to heroin. Marijuana use was also common in Vietnam. Soldiers who used drugs had more disciplinary problems. The frequent drug use had become an issue for the commanders in Vietnam; in 1971 it was estimated that 30,000 servicemen were addicted to drugs, most of them to [[heroin]].&lt;ref name="Nixon Calls War on Drugs"/&gt;

From 1971 on, therefore, returning servicemen were required to take a mandatory heroin test. Servicemen who tested positive upon returning from Vietnam were not allowed to return home until they had passed the test with a negative result. The program also offered a treatment for heroin addicts.&lt;ref name="vander"&gt;Peter Brush: [http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/American-drug-use-vietnam.htm#_ednref20 HIGHER AND HIGHER: AMERICAN DRUG USE IN VIETNAM], ''Vietnam magazine'', Vol.15, No. 4, December 2002 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103439/http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/American-drug-use-vietnam.htm#_ednref20 |date=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Intercept===
One of the first anti-drug efforts in the realm of foreign policy was President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]'s [[Operation Intercept]], announced in September 1969, targeted at reducing the amount of cannabis entering the United States from Mexico. The effort began with an intense inspection crackdown that resulted in an almost shutdown of cross-border traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB86/|title=Operation Intercept: The perils of unilateralism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the burden on border crossings was controversial in border states, the effort only lasted twenty days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/library/studies/cu/CU59.html |title=Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs |publisher=Druglibrary.org |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Just Cause===
{{Main|Operation Just Cause|Operation Nifty Package}}
[[File:Panama clashes 1989.JPEG|thumb|right|The U.S. military invasion of Panama in 1989]]
On December 20, 1989, the United States invaded Panama as part of [[Operation Just Cause]], which involved 25,000 American troops. Gen. [[Manuel Noriega]], head of the government of Panama, had been giving military assistance to [[Contras|Contra groups]] in Nicaragua at the request of the U.S. which, in exchange, tolerated his drug trafficking activities, which they had known about since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="whiteout-noriega" /&gt;&lt;ref name="panama-buckley"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Buckley|first=Kevin|title=Panama: The Whole Story|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1991|isbn=978-0-671-72794-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) tried to indict Noriega in 1971, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] prevented them from doing so.&lt;ref name="whiteout-noriega"&gt;Cockburn and St. Clair, 1998: pp. 287–290&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA, which was then directed by future president [[George H.

As part of its [[Plan Colombia]] program, the United States government currently provides hundreds of millions of dollars per year of [[military aid]], training, and equipment to Colombia,&lt;ref name="house-colombia-appropriations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Fappropriations.house.gov/pdf/FY10_SFOPS_Conference_Summary.pdf|title=SUMMARY: FY 2010 STATE AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS|year=2010|website=U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fight left-wing guerrillas such as the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC-EP), which has been accused of being involved in drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;Weiser, Benjamin.

Private U.S. corporations have signed contracts to carry out anti-drug activities as part of Plan Colombia. [[DynCorp]], the largest private company involved, was among those contracted by the State Department, while others signed contracts with the Defense Department.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.colectivodeabogados.org/article.php3?id_article=1253 Private Security Transnational Enterprises in Colombia]'' [[José Alvear Restrepo Lawyers' Collective]] February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombian military personnel have received extensive [[counterinsurgency]] training from U.S. military and law enforcement agencies, including the [[School of Americas]] (SOA). Author Grace Livingstone has stated that more Colombian SOA graduates have been implicated in human rights abuses than currently known SOA graduates from any other country. All of the commanders of the brigades highlighted in a 2001 [[Human Rights Watch]] report on Colombia were graduates of the SOA, including the III brigade in [[Valle del Cauca]], where the 2001 [[Paramilitarism in Colombia#The Alto Naya massacre|Alto Naya Massacre]] occurred. US-trained officers have been accused of being directly or indirectly involved in many atrocities during the 1990s, including the [[Massacre of Trujillo]] and the 1997 [[Mapiripán Massacre]].

In 2000, the Clinton administration initially waived all but one of the human rights conditions attached to Plan Colombia, considering such aid as crucial to national security at the time.&lt;ref name="doug"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stokes |first=Doug |title=America's Other War: Terrorizing Colombia |url=http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/54324.html |publisher=Zed Books |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84277-547-9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109132325/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/54324.html |archivedate=January 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} p.&amp;nbsp;99&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Washington Office on Latin America]] concluded that both Plan Colombia and the Colombian government's security strategy "came at a high cost in lives and resources, only did part of the job, are yielding diminishing returns and have left important institutions weaker."&lt;ref&gt;Washington Office on Latin America [http://www.wola.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=viewp&amp;id=1134&amp;Itemid=2 "Columbia: Don't Call it a Model"], July 13, 2010 Retrieved on May 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Between 1999 and 2002, the United States gave Colombia $2.04 billion in aid, 81 percent of which was for military purposes, placing Colombia just below Israel and Egypt among the largest recipients of U.S. military assistance. Colombia increased its defense spending from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2000 to 4.19 percent in 2005. Overall, the results were extremely positive. Greater spending on infrastructure and social programs helped the Colombian government increase its political legitimacy, while improved security forces were better able to consolidate control over large swaths of the country previously overrun by insurgents and drug cartels.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also notes that, "Plan Colombia has been widely hailed as a success, and some analysts believe that, by 2010, Colombian security forces had finally gained the upper hand once and for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico Is Not Colombia|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR500/RR548z2/RAND_RR548z2.pdf|website=rand.org|publisher=RAND Corporation National Security Research Division|accessdate=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MilitaresMichoacán.jpg|thumb|Mexico is scheduled to receive US$1.6 billion in equipment and strategic support from the United States through the [[Mérida Initiative]]]]

===Mérida Initiative===
The [[Mérida Initiative]] is a security cooperation between the United States and the government of Mexico and the countries of [[Central America]]. It was approved on June 30, 2008, and its stated aim is combating the threats of drug trafficking and transnational crime. The Mérida Initiative appropriated $1.4 billion in a three-year commitment (2008–2010) to the Mexican government for military and law enforcement training and equipment, as well as technical advice and training to strengthen the national justice systems. The Mérida Initiative targeted many very important government officials, but it failed to address the thousands of Central Americans who had to flee their countries due to the danger they faced everyday because of the war on drugs. There is still not any type of plan that addresses these people. No weapons are included in the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/news/defence/business/jdw/jdw071211_1_n.shtml |title=Mexico's 2008 defence budget goes under review |publisher=Janes.com |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0508/10180.html |title=Bush pushes Mexico money in Iraq bill |publisher=Politico.com |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States regularly sponsors the spraying of large amounts of [[herbicide]]s such as [[glyphosate]] over the jungles of Central and South America as part of its drug eradication programs.

===U.S. operations in Honduras===
In 2012, the U.S. sent DEA agents to Honduras to assist security forces in counternarcotics operations. Honduras has been a major stop for drug traffickers, who use small planes and landing strips hidden throughout the country to transport drugs. The U.S. government made agreements with several Latin American countries to share intelligence and resources to counter the drug trade. DEA agents, working with other U.S. agencies such as the State Department, the CBP, and Joint Task Force-Bravo, assisted Honduras troops in conducting raids on traffickers' sites of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A New Front Line in the U.S. Drug War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/americas/honduran-drug-raid-deaths-wont-alter-us-policy.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ONDCP Pothead.gif|thumb|An American domestic government propaganda poster circa 2000 concerning [[cannabis in the United States]].]]

The War on Drugs has been a highly contentious issue since its inception. A poll on October 2, 2008, found that three in four Americans believed that the War On Drugs was failing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zogby.com/news/readnews.cfm?ID=1568 |title=Public Views Clash with U.S. Policy on Cuba, Immigration, and Drugs |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |date=October 2, 2008 |publisher=Zogby International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211052209/http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.cfm?ID=1568 |archivedate=February 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a Pew Research Center poll found more than six in ten Americans state that state governments moving away from mandatory prison terms for drug law violations is a good thing. while three out of ten Americans say these policy changes are a bad thing. This a substantial shift from the same poll questions since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/january_2018/voters_have_little_faith_in_war_on_druSince|title=Voters Have Little Faith in War on Drugs|last=|first=|date=January 10, 2018|website=Rasmussen Reports|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 a Pew Research Center poll found that 67 percent of Americans feel that a movement towards treatment for drugs like cocaine and heroin is better versus the 26 percent who feel that prosecution is the better route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.people-press.org/2014/04/02/americas-new-drug-policy-landscape/|title=America’s New Drug Policy Landscape {{!}} Pew Research Center|date=2014-04-02|work=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Rasmussen Report poll found that less than 10 percent of Americans think that the War on Drugs is being won and that 75 percent found that Americans believe that America is not winning the War on Drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/press-release/2014/04/new-pew-poll-confirms-americans-ready-end-war-drugs|title=New Pew Poll Confirms Americans Ready to End War on Drugs|website=Drug Policy Alliance|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican citizens, unlike American citizens, support the current measures their government were taking against drug cartels in the War on Drugs. A Pew Research Center poll in 2010 found that 80 percent supported the current use of the army in the War on Drugs to combat drug traffickers with about 55 percent saying that they have been making progress in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/08/12/mexicans-continue-support-for-drug-war/|title=Mexicans Continue Support for Drug War {{!}} Pew Research Center|date=2010-08-12|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later in 2011 a Pew Research Center poll uncovered that 71 percent of Mexicans find that "illegal drugs are a very big problem in their country". 77 percent of Mexicans also found that drug cartels and the violence associated with them are as well a big challenge for Mexico. The poll also found that the percentages believing that that illegal drugs and violence related to the cartel where Higher in the North with 87 percent for illegal drug use and 94 percent cartel related violence being a problem. This compared to the other locations: South, Mexico City and the greater area of Mexico City, and Central Mexico which are all about 18 percent or lower than the North on Illegal drug use being a problem for the country. These perspective areas are also lower than the North by 19 percent or more on the issue of drug cartel related violence being an issue for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/08/31/crime-and-drug-cartels-top-concerns-in-mexico/|title=Crime and Drug Cartels Top Concerns in Mexico|date=2011-08-31|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a Pew Research Center poll found that 74 percent of Mexican citizens would support the training of their police and military, the poll also found that another 55 percent would support the supplying of weapons and financial aid. Though the poll indicates a support of U.S. aid, 59 percent were against troops on the ground by the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/16/mexican-public-favors-military-use-u-s-aid-to-fight-drug-cartels/|title=Mexican public favors military use, U.S. aid to fight drug cartels {{!}} Pew Research Center|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013 Pew Research Center found in a poll that 56 percent of Mexican citizens believe that the United States and Mexico are both to blame for drug violence in Mexico. In that same poll 20 percent believe that the United States is solely to blame and 17 percent believe that Mexico is solely to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/04/29/u-s-image-rebounds-in-mexico/|title=U.S. Image Rebounds in Mexico|date=2013-04-29|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting in Guatemala in 2012, three former presidents from Guatemala, Mexico and Colombia said that the war on drugs had failed and that they would propose a discussion on alternatives, including decriminalization, at the [[Summit of the Americas]] in April of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21551550 |title= Politics this week |date= March 31, 2012 |journal= The Economist |accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guatemalan President [[Otto Pérez Molina]] said that the war on drugs was exacting too high a price on the lives of Central Americans and that it was time to "end the [[taboo]] on discussing decriminalization".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17502417 BBC News – Guatemala's president urges debate on drug legalisation]. Bbc.co.uk (March 25, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; At the summit, the government of Colombia pushed for the most far-reaching change to drugs policy since the war on narcotics was declared by Nixon four decades prior, citing the catastrophic effects it had had in Colombia.&lt;ref name = "EdVu 15Apr2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/15/colombia-global-drugs-taskforce |title= Colombia calls for global drugs taskforce |author= Ed Vulliamy |date= April 15, 2012 |newspaper= The Observer |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several critics have compared the wholesale incarceration of the dissenting minority of drug users to the wholesale incarceration of other minorities in history. Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]], for example, wrote in 1997 "Over the past thirty years, we have replaced the medical-political persecution of illegal sex users ('perverts' and 'psychopaths') with the even more ferocious medical-political persecution of illegal drug users."&lt;ref&gt;''The Manufacture of Madness: A Comparative Study of the Inquisition and the Mental Health Movement'' (1997), p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-economic effects==

===Creation of a permanent underclass===
[[File:Utah State Prison Wasatch Facility.jpg|thumb|Circa 1 million people are [[United States incarceration rate|incarcerated every year in the United States]] for drug law violations.]]

Penalties for drug crimes among American youth almost always involve permanent or semi-permanent removal from opportunities for education, [[Felony disenfranchisement|strip them of voting rights]], and later involve creation of criminal records which make employment more difficult.&lt;ref name="howto-construct-underclass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/4cs/files/2008/11/blumenson-and-nilsenlawrev.pdf|title=How to construct an underclass, ''or'' how the War on Drugs became a war on education |last=Blumenson |first=Eric |author2=Eva S. Nilsen  |date=May 16, 2002 |format=PDF |publisher=Drug Policy Forum of Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some authors maintain that the War on Drugs has resulted in the creation of a permanent underclass of people who have few educational or job opportunities, often as a result of being punished for drug offenses which in turn have resulted from attempts to earn a living in spite of having no education or job opportunities.&lt;ref name="howto-construct-underclass" /&gt;

===Costs to taxpayers===
According to a 2008 study published by [[Harvard]] economist [[Jeffrey A. Miron]], the annual savings on enforcement and incarceration costs from the legalization of drugs would amount to roughly $41.3 billion, with $25.7 billion being saved among the states and over $15.6 billion accrued for the federal government. Miron further estimated at least $46.7 billion in tax revenue based on rates comparable to those on [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol]] ($8.7 billion from [[marijuana]], $32.6 billion from [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]], remainder from other drugs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/DrugProhibitionWP.pdf|title=The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition |publisher=CATO.org |author1=Jeffrey A. Miron  |author2=Katherine Waldock |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low taxation in Central American countries has been credited with weakening the region's response in dealing with drug traffickers. Many cartels, especially [[Los Zetas]] have taken advantage of the limited resources of these nations. 2010 tax revenue in [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Honduras]], composed just 13.53% of GDP. As a comparison, in [[Chile]] and the U.S., taxes were 18.6% and 26.9% of GDP respectively. However, [[direct taxes]] on income are very hard to enforce and in some cases tax evasion is seen as a national pastime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coha.org/low-taxation-perpetuates-insecurity-in-central-america/|title=Low Taxation Perpetuates Insecurity in Central America|website=COHA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on growers===
The status of [[coca]] and coca growers has become an intense political issue in several countries, including Colombia and particularly Bolivia, where the president, [[Evo Morales]], a former coca growers' union leader, has promised to legalise the traditional cultivation and use of coca.&lt;ref name="Conflict"&gt;Ledebur, K. and Youngers, C. 2013. From Conflict to Collaboration: An Innovative Approach to Reducing Coca Cultivation in Bolivia. [[Stability: International Journal of Security and Development]] 2(1):9, DOI: http://stabilityjournal.org/article/view/sta.aw&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, legalization efforts have yielded some successes under the Morales administration when combined with aggressive and targeted eradication efforts. The country saw a 12–13% decline in coca cultivation&lt;ref name="Conflict" /&gt; in 2011 under Morales, who has used coca growers' federations to ensure compliance with the law rather than providing a primary role for security forces.&lt;ref name="Conflict" /&gt;

The coca eradication policy has been criticised for its negative impact on the livelihood of coca growers in South America. In many areas of South America the coca leaf has traditionally been chewed and used in tea and for religious, medicinal and nutritional purposes by locals.&lt;ref name="wa-times-bolivian-coca-growers-fight"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/211-development/44365.html|title=Bolivian Coca Growers Fight Eradication|last=Lindsay|first=Reed|date=March 25, 2003 |work=Washington Times|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason many insist that the illegality of traditional coca cultivation is unjust. In many areas the U.S. government and military has forced the eradication of coca without providing for any meaningful alternative crop for farmers, and has additionally destroyed many of their food or market crops, leaving them starving and destitute.&lt;ref name="wa-times-bolivian-coca-growers-fight" /&gt;

==Allegations of U.S. government assistance in drug trafficking==
{{further|Allegations of CIA drug trafficking}}

The CIA, DEA, State Department, and several other U.S. government agencies have been alleged to have relations with various groups which are involved in drug trafficking.

===CIA and Contra cocaine trafficking===
{{further|CIA and Contras cocaine trafficking in the US}}

[[US Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]]'s 1988 [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] report on Contra drug links concludes that members of the U.S. State Department "who provided support for the Contras are involved in drug trafficking... and elements of the Contras themselves knowingly receive financial and material assistance from drug traffickers."&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn and St. Clair, 1998: {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report further states that "the Contra drug links include... payments to drug traffickers by the [[U.S. State Department]] of funds authorized by the Congress for humanitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies."

In 1996, journalist [[Gary Webb]] published reports in the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', and later in his book ''[[Dark Alliance]]'', detailing how [[Contras]], had been involved in distributing [[crack cocaine]] into Los Angeles whilst receiving money from the CIA.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Contras used money from drug trafficking to buy weapons.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Webb's premise regarding the U.S. Government connection was initially attacked at the time by the media. It is now widely accepted that Webb's main assertion of government "knowledge of drug operations, and collaboration with and protection of known drug traffickers" was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 2 – The Contras, Cocaine, and Covert Operations | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}} In 1998, CIA [[Inspector General]] [[Frederick Hitz]] published a two-volume report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Frederick Hitz | title = CIA Inspector General report into allegations of connections between the CIA and the Contras in cocaine trafficking to the United States | publisher = [[CIA]] | year=  1998 | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/report/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; that while seemingly refuting Webb's claims of knowledge and collaboration in its conclusions did not deny them in its body.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Hitz went on to [[CIA and Contras cocaine trafficking in the US#Testimony of the CIA Inspector General|admit]] CIA improprieties in the affair in testimony to a House congressional committee. There has been a reversal amongst mainstream media of its position on Webb's work, with [[Gary Webb#Views on "Dark Alliance" series|acknowledgement]] made of his contribution to exposing a scandal it had ignored.

===Heroin trafficking operations involving the CIA, U.S. Navy and Sicilian Mafia===
{{further|Collaborations between the United States government and Italian Mafia}}
According to Rodney Campbell, an editorial assistant to Nelson Rockefeller, during World War II, the United States Navy, concerned that strikes and labor disputes in U.S. eastern shipping ports would disrupt wartime logistics, released the mobster [[Lucky Luciano]] from prison, and collaborated with him to help the mafia take control of those ports. Labor union members were terrorized and murdered by mafia members as a means of preventing labor unrest and ensuring smooth shipping of supplies to Europe.&lt;ref name="luciano-project-campbell"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Campbell|first=Rodney|title=The Luciano Project: The Secret Wartime Collaboration Between the Mafia and the U.S. Navy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-KEAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Luciano+release#search_anchor|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1977|isbn=978-0-07-009674-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, in order to prevent [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]] party members from being elected in Italy following World War II, the CIA worked closely with the [[Sicilian Mafia]], protecting them and assisting in their worldwide heroin smuggling operations. The mafia was in conflict with leftist groups and was involved in assassinating, torturing, and beating leftist political organizers.&lt;ref name = "whiteout-luckys-break"&gt;Cockburn and St. Clair, 1998: Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the US Defense Department funded a two-year study by the [[RAND Corporation]], which found that the use of the armed forces to interdict drugs coming into the United States would have little or no effect on cocaine traffic and might, in fact, raise the profits of cocaine cartels and manufacturers. The 175-page study, "Sealing the Borders: The Effects of Increased Military Participation in Drug Interdiction", was prepared by seven researchers, mathematicians and economists at the National Defense Research Institute, a branch of the RAND, and was released in 1988. The study noted that seven prior studies in the past nine years, including one by the Center for Naval Research and the Office of Technology Assessment, had come to similar conclusions. Interdiction efforts, using current armed forces resources, would have almost no effect on cocaine importation into the United States, the report concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Reuter, ''Sealing the borders: the effects of increased military participation in drug interdiction'' (RAND 1988); Robert E. Kessler, "Study: Military Can't Curb Drugs", ''Newsday'', May 23, 1988 at 23; "Military support would have little effect on drug smuggling, study says", United Press International, March 4, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early-to-mid-1990s, the [[Clinton administration]] ordered and funded a major cocaine policy study, again by RAND. The Rand Drug Policy Research Center study concluded that $3 billion should be switched from federal and local law enforcement to treatment. The report said that treatment is the cheapest way to cut drug use, stating that drug treatment is twenty-three times more effective than the supply-side "war on drugs".&lt;ref&gt;C. Peter Rydell, ''Controlling Cocaine: Supply Versus Demand Programs'' (Rand Drug Policy Research Center 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Committee on Data and Research for Policy on Illegal Drugs published its findings in 2001 on the efficacy of the drug war. The NRC Committee found that existing studies on efforts to address drug usage and smuggling, from U.S. military operations to eradicate coca fields in Colombia, to domestic drug treatment centers, have all been inconclusive, if the programs have been evaluated at all: "The existing drug-use monitoring systems are strikingly inadequate to support the full range of policy decisions that the nation must make.... It is unconscionable for this country to continue to carry out a public policy of this magnitude and cost without any way of knowing whether and to what extent it is having the desired effect."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205024427/http://www.dpeg.org/dpeg_2001_spg.pdf Drug Policy News], Drug Policy Education Group, Vol. 2 No.1, Spring/Summer 2001, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The study, though not ignored by the press, was ignored by top-level policymakers, leading Committee Chair [[Charles Manski]] to conclude, as one observer notes, that "the drug war has no interest in its own results".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugsense.org/dsw/2001/ds01.n215.html "Weekly News in Review"], ''DrugSense Weekly'', August 31, 2001 #215&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1995, the US government tried to reduce the supply of [[methamphetamine]] precursors to disrupt the market of this drug. According to a 2009 study, this effort was successful, but its effects were largely temporary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobkin|first1=Carlos|last2=Nicosia|first2=Nancy|title=The War on Drugs: Methamphetamine, Public Health, and Crime|journal=American Economic Review|date=February 2009|volume=99|issue=1|pages=324–349|doi=10.1257/aer.99.1.324|pmid=20543969|pmc=2883188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Prohibition in the United States|alcohol prohibition]], the period from 1920 to 1933, alcohol use initially fell but began to increase as early as 1922. It has been extrapolated that even if prohibition had not been repealed in 1933, alcohol consumption would have quickly surpassed pre-prohibition levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-157.html |title=Alcohol Prohibition Was a Failure |publisher=Cato.org |date=July 17, 1991 |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229232307/http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-157.html |archivedate=December 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One argument against the War on Drugs is that it uses similar measures as Prohibition and is no more effective.

In the six years from 2000 to 2006, the U.S. spent $4.7 billion on [[Plan Colombia]], an effort to eradicate coca production in Colombia. The main result of this effort was to shift coca production into more remote areas and force other forms of adaptation. The overall acreage cultivated for coca in Colombia at the end of the six years was found to be the same, after the U.S. Drug Czar's office announced a change in measuring methodology in 2005 and included new areas in its surveys.&lt;ref name = "est"&gt;{{cite web| date =April 14, 2006 | url =http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/news/press06/041406.html | title =2005 Coca Estimates for Colombia | publisher =Office of National Drug Control Policy |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234649/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/news/press06/041406.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivation in the neighboring countries of Peru and Bolivia increased, some would describe this effect like squeezing a balloon.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Forero, "Colombia's Coca Survives U.S. plan to uproot it", ''The New York Times'', August 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alberto Fujimori]], president of Peru from 1990 to 2000, described U.S. foreign drug policy as "failed" on grounds that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;for 10 years, there has been a considerable sum invested by the Peruvian government and another sum on the part of the American government, and this has not led to a reduction in the supply of coca leaf offered for sale. Rather, in the 10 years from 1980 to 1990, it grew 10-fold.&lt;ref&gt;Don Podesta and Douglas Farah, "Drug Policy in Andes Called Failure", ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 27, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At least 500 economists, including [[Nobel Laureate]]s [[Milton Friedman]],&lt;ref name="streatfeild"&gt;Dominic Streatfeild, "Source Material for ''Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography'': Interview between Milton Friedman and Dominic Streatfeild", June 2000 [http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Akerlof]] and [[Vernon L. Smith]], have noted that reducing the supply of marijuana without reducing the demand causes the price, and hence the profits of marijuana sellers, to go up, according to the laws of supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An open letter |url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html |publisher=Prohibition Costs |accessdate=February 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017021537/http://prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html |archivedate=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased profits encourage the producers to produce more drugs despite the risks, providing a theoretical explanation for why attacks on drug supply have failed to have any lasting effect. The aforementioned economists published an open letter to President [[George W. Bush]] stating "We urge...the country to commence an open and honest debate about marijuana prohibition... At a minimum, this debate will force advocates of current policy to show that prohibition has benefits sufficient to justify the cost to [[taxpayer]]s, foregone tax revenues and numerous ancillary consequences that result from marijuana prohibition."

The declaration from the World Forum Against Drugs, 2008 state that a balanced policy of drug abuse prevention, education,
treatment, law enforcement, research, and supply reduction provides the most effective platform to reduce drug abuse and its associated harms and call on governments to consider [[demand reduction]] as one of their first priorities in the fight against drug abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfad.se/about-wfad/wfad-declaration Declaration of World Forum Against Drugs, Stockholm 2008.

==Legality==
{{Main|Legality of the War on Drugs}}

The legality of the War on Drugs has been challenged on four main grounds in the U.S.
# It is argued that drug prohibition, as presently implemented, violates the [[substantive due process]] doctrine in that its benefits do not justify the encroachments on rights that are supposed to be guaranteed by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. On July 27, 2011, U.S. District Judge Mary S. Scriven ruled that Florida's legislation purporting to eliminate intent as an element of the crime of drug possession was unconstitutional. Commentators explained the ruling in terms of due process.
# Freedom of religious conscience legally allows some (for example, members of the [[Native American Church]]) to use [[peyote]] with definite spiritual or religious motives. The sacramental use of [[dimethyltryptamine]] in the form of [[ayahuasca]] is also allowed for members of [[União do Vegetal]]. The [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] implies no requirement for someone to be affiliated to an official church – therefore leaving some ambiguity.
# It has been argued that the [[Commerce Clause]] means that the power to regulate drug use should be state law not federal law.
# The inequity of prosecuting the war on certain drugs but not alcohol or tobacco has also been called into question.

==Alternatives==
{{See also|Responsible drug use}}
Several authors believe that the United States' federal and state governments have chosen wrong methods for combatting the distribution of illicit substances. Aggressive, heavy-handed enforcement funnels individuals through courts and prisons; instead of treating the cause of the addiction, the focus of government efforts has been on punishment. By making drugs illegal rather than regulating them, the War on Drugs creates a highly profitable black market. [[Jefferson Fish]] has edited scholarly collections of articles offering a wide variety of public health based and rights based alternative drug policies.&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M. (Ed.) (1998). ''How to legalize drugs''. Northvale, New Jersey: Jason Aronson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M. (Ed.) (2000). "Is our drug policy effective? Are there alternatives?" New York City, New York: ''Fordham Urban Law Journal''. (Proceedings of the March 17 &amp; 18, 2000 joint conference of the New York Academy of Sciences, New York Academy of Medicine, and Association of the Bar of the City of New York. Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 3–262.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M. (Ed.) (2006). ''Drugs and society: U. S. public policy''. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000, the United States drug-control budget reached 18.4 billion dollars,&lt;ref name="Alter, Jonathan 2001, pp. 37-43"&gt;Alter, Jonathan. "The War on Addiction". ''Newsweek'', February 12, 2001, pp. 37–43&lt;/ref&gt; nearly half of which was spent financing law enforcement while only one sixth was spent on treatment. In the year 2003, 53 percent of the requested drug control budget was for enforcement, 29 percent for treatment, and 18 percent for prevention.&lt;ref&gt;''How Goes the "War on Drugs": An Assessment of U.S. Drug Problems and Policy''. RAND Corporation Drug Policy Research Center, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The state of New York, in particular, designated 17 percent of its budget towards substance-abuse-related spending. Of that, a mere one percent was put towards prevention, treatment, and research.

In a survey taken by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), it was found that substance abusers that remain in treatment longer are less likely to resume their former drug habits. Of the people that were studied, 66 percent were cocaine users. After experiencing long-term in-patient treatment, only 22 percent returned to the use of cocaine. Treatment had reduced the number of cocaine abusers by two-thirds.&lt;ref name="Alter, Jonathan 2001, pp. 37-43"/&gt; By spending the majority of its money on law enforcement, the federal government had underestimated the true value of drug-treatment facilities and their benefit towards reducing the number of addicts in the U.S.

In 2004 the federal government issued the National Drug Control Strategy. It supported programs designed to expand treatment options, enhance treatment delivery, and improve treatment outcomes. For example, the Strategy provided SAMHSA with a $100.6 million grant to put towards their Access to Recovery (ATR) initiative. ATR is a program that provides vouchers to addicts to provide them with the means to acquire clinical treatment or recovery support. The project's goals are to expand capacity, support client choice, and increase the array of faith-based and community based providers for clinical treatment and recovery support services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atr.samhsa.gov/|title=Recovery to Practice Resources|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ATR program will also provide a more flexible array of services based on the individual's treatment needs.

The 2004 Strategy additionally declared a significant 32 million dollar raise in the Drug Courts Program, which provides drug offenders with alternatives to incarceration. As a substitute for imprisonment, drug courts identify substance-abusing offenders and place them under strict court monitoring and community supervision, as well as provide them with long-term treatment services.&lt;ref name="whitehouse-policy-2004"&gt;[http://whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/policy/ndcs04/index.html The President's National Drug Control Strategy], ''White House'', 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213091104/http://whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/policy/ndcs04/index.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report issued by the National Drug Court Institute, drug courts have a wide array of benefits, with only 16.4 percent of the nation's drug court graduates rearrested and charged with a felony within one year of completing the program (versus the 44.1% of released prisoners who end up back in prison within 1-year). Additionally, enrolling an addict in a drug court program costs much less than incarcerating one in prison.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Huddleston, C. West III, et al. ''Painting the Current Picture: A National Report Card on Drug Courts and Other Problem Solving Court Programs in the United States'', Vol. 1, Num. 1, May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Prisons, the fee to cover the average cost of incarceration for Federal inmates in 2006 was $24,440.&lt;ref&gt;Lappin, Harley G. Annual Determination of Average Cost of Incarceration. Department of Justice – Bureau of Prisons. June 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The annual cost of receiving treatment in a drug court program ranges from $900 to $3,500. Drug courts in New York State alone saved $2.54 million in incarceration costs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Describing the failure of the War on Drugs, ''New York Times'' columnist Eduardo Porter noted:

{{quote|Jeffrey Miron, an economist at Harvard who studies drug policy closely, has suggested that legalizing all illicit drugs would produce net benefits to the United States of some $65 billion a year, mostly by cutting public spending on enforcement as well as through reduced crime and corruption. A study by analysts at the RAND Corporation, a California research organization, suggested that if marijuana were legalized in California and the drug spilled from there to other states, Mexican drug cartels would lose about a fifth of their annual income of some $6.5 billion from illegal exports to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Porter |first= Eduardo |date= July 3, 2012 |title= Numbers Tell of Failure in Drug War |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/business/in-rethinking-the-war-on-drugs-start-with-the-numbers.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many believe that the War on Drugs has been costly and ineffective largely because inadequate emphasis is placed on treatment of [[addiction]]. The United States leads the world in both recreational drug usage and incarceration rates. 70% of men arrested in metropolitan areas test positive for an illicit substance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/05/17/data-suggests-drug-treatment-can-lower-us-crime/ |title= Data Suggests Drug Treatment can Lower U.S. Crime |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 17, 2012 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 54% of all men incarcerated will be repeat offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= English |first= Matthew |date= September 30, 2012 |title=U.S. Prison System Needs Reform, Does not Meet Intended Goals |url=http://www.collegiatetimes.com/stories/15927/us-prison-system-needs-reform-does-not-meet-intended-goals |work= Collegiate Times |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
