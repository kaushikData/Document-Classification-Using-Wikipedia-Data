'''''A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing''''' is a non-fiction book by the physicist [[Lawrence M. Krauss]], initially published on January 10, 2012 by [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]. It discusses modern [[cosmogony]] and its implications for the debate about the [[existence of God]]. The main theme of the book is how "we have discovered that all signs suggest a universe that could and plausibly did arise from a deeper [[nothing]]—involving the absence of [[space-time|space]] itself and— which may one day return to nothing via processes that may not only be comprehensible but also processes that do not require any external control or direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reynosa|first1=Peter|title=Some of the Changes Lawrence M. Krauss Should Make to the Second Edition of "A Universe From Nothing"|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-reynosa/some-of-the-changes-lawre_b_9664630.html|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krauss|first1=Lawrence M.|title=A Universe from  Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing|date=2012|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4516-2445-8|page=183}}&lt;!--|accessdate=April 4, 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==
The book ends with an afterword by [[Richard Dawkins]] in which he compares the potential impact of the book to that of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' — a comparison that Krauss himself called "pretentious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andersen|first=Ross|title=Has Physics Made Philosophy and Religion Obsolete?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/has-physics-made-philosophy-and-religion-obsolete/256203/|publisher=theatlantic.com|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]] had agreed to write a foreword for the book prior to his death but was too ill to complete it.&lt;ref name=afterword&gt;{{cite web|last=Krauss |first=Lawrence |title=Afterword from Lawrence Krauss' New Book – A Universe From Nothing |url=http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/644421-afterword-from-lawrence-krauss-new-book-a-universe-from-nothing |work=excerpt |publisher=richarddawkins.net |accessdate=11 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221051332/http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/644421-afterword-from-lawrence-krauss-new-book-a-universe-from-nothing |archivedate=21 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To write the book, Krauss expanded material from a lecture on the cosmological implications of a [[flat expanding universe]] he gave to the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation]] at the 2009 [[Atheist Alliance International]] conference.&lt;ref name=afterword /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Krauss's 2009 lecture [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo A Universe from Nothing]&lt;/ref&gt; The book appeared on ''The New York Times'' [[The New York Times bestseller list|bestseller list]] on January 29, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Non Fiction Best Sellers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-01-29/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|accessdate=11 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', philosopher of science and physicist [[David Albert]] said the book failed to live up to its title; he claimed Krauss dismissed concerns about what Albert calls his misuse of the term ''nothing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Albert |first=David |title=On the Origin of Everything |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/a-universe-from-nothing-by-lawrence-m-krauss.html |accessdate=25 April 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times Sunday Book Review |date=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caleb Scharf]], writing in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', said that "it would be easy for this remarkable story to revel in self-congratulation, but Krauss steers it soberly and with grace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scharf|first1=Caleb|title=Cosmology: Plucked from the vacuum|journal=Nature|date=25 January 2012|volume=481|issue=7382|pages=440–440|doi=10.1038/481440a|bibcode = 2012Natur.481..440S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ray Jayawardhana]], Canada Research Chair in observational astrophysics at the University of Toronto, wrote for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' that Kraus "delivers a spirited, fast-paced romp through modern cosmology and its strong underpinnings in astronomical observations and particle physics theory" and that he "makes a persuasive case that the ultimate question of cosmic origin – how something, namely the universe, could arise from nothing – belongs in the realm of science rather than theology or philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Globe and Mail|last=Jayawardhana|first=Ray|date=17 February 2012|title=A Universe From Nothing, by Lawrence Krauss|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/a-universe-from-nothing-by-lawrence-krauss/article548906/|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[New Scientist]]'', [[Michael Brooks (science writer)|Michael Brooks]] wrote, "Krauss will be preaching only to the converted. That said, we should be happy to be preached to so intelligently. The same can't be said about the Dawkins afterword, which is both superfluous and silly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Michael|title=The paradox of nothing|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=14 January 2012|volume=213|issue=2847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the philosophical debate sparked by the book, the physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]] asked, "Do advances in modern physics and cosmology help us address these underlying questions, of why there is something called the universe at all, and why there are things called '[[Physical law|the laws of physics]],' and why those laws seem to take the form of [[quantum mechanics]], and why some particular [[wave function]] and [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]? In a word: no. I don't see how they could."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/04/28/a-universe-from-nothing/ |title=A Universe from Nothing? - Cosmic Variance : Cosmic Variance |publisher=Blogs.discovermagazine.com |date=April 28, 2012 |accessdate=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cognitive psychology]] the '''affect-as-information hypothesis''', or ‘approach’ is a model of evaluative processing, postulating that affective [[feeling]]s provide a source of information about objects, tasks, and decision alternatives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Storbeck|first1=Justin|last2=Clore|first2=Gerald L.|date=September 2008|title=Affective Arousal as Information: How Affective Arousal Influences Judgments, Learning, and Memory|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=2|issue=5|pages=1824–1843|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2008.00138.x|pmid=25067943|pmc=4110743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Clore, G. L., &amp; Storbeck, J. (2006). Affect as information about liking, efficacy, and importance. In J. P. Forgas &amp; J. P. Forgas (Eds.), Affect in social thinking and behavior. (pp. 123-141). New York, NY, US: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A goal of this approach is to understand the extent of influence that [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] has on cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has been proposed that affect has two major dimensions, namely affective [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] and affective arousal,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and in this way is an embodied source of information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Affect is thought to impact three main cognitive functions: [[judgement]], thought processing and [[memory]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a variety of scenarios, the influence of affect on these processes is thought to be mediated by its effects on [[attention]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zadra|first1=Jonathan R.|last2=Clore|first2=Gerald L.|date=11 July 2011|title=Emotion and perception: the role of affective information|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|volume=2|issue=6|pages=676–685|doi=10.1002/wcs.147|pmid=22039565|pmc=3203022|issn=1939-5078}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach is thought to account for a wide variety of behavioural phenomena in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forgas |first1=edited by Joseph P. |title=Handbook of affect and social cognition |date=2001 |publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates |location=Mahwah, N.J. |isbn=9780585350660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informative functions of affect: reaction vs. arousal==

The affect as information hypothesis emphasises significance of the information that affect communicates, rather than the affective feelings themselves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Affective reactions or ‘responses’ provide an embodied source of information about ‘value’ or valence, as well as affective arousal provides an embodied source of information about importance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More specifically, affective reactions are pleasant or unpleasant reactions that provide information on positive (‘good’) and negative (‘bad’) value, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Objects, task situations, and other stimuli or targets- if experienced as the source of an affective reaction- take on the positive or negative affect value.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Affective arousal involves implicit (stress hormonal response such as from the [[adrenergic system]]) or explicit responses (subjective experience)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; that provide information on relevance, urgency, or importance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both dimensions are thought to effect cognitive functioning through influencing judgements and decision making, processing, and memory,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and in a variety of situations this is thought to be mediated through its influences on attention.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Affect on judgement and decision making==
===Affective reaction===
A finding by Schwarz and Clore (1988) has been noted in literature (for example,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;), wherein individuals are thought to review and attend to their affective reactions when making evaluative judgements and decisions. They typically ask themselves, “How do I feel about it”.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, N., &amp; Clore, G. L. (1988). How do I feel about it? Informative functions of affective states. In K. Fiedler &amp; J. Forgas (Eds.), Affect, cognition, and social behavior (pp. 44-62). Toronto: Hogrefe International.&lt;/ref&gt; A broad example of this (which may be applied to a variety of situations) is when considering how much we like something. Our judgements are based on how we feel about a particular stimulus as opposed to the attributes or characteristics of the said stimulus.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Schwarz, N., &amp; Clore, G. L. (2007). Feelings and phenomenal experiences. In A. W. Kruglanski, E. T. Higgins, A. W. Kruglanski, E. T. Higgins (Eds.) , Social psychology: Handbook of basic principles (pp. 385-407). New York, NY, US: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, if the object, task situation, or other stimulus is experienced as the source of an affective reaction and takes on the affect value, then a judgement or decision may be made about the stimulus based on these attributed feelings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Positive and negative affect typically lead to positive and negative judgements, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Affective arousal===
Affective arousal is thought to intensify positive and negative affective reactions and, as a result, judgemental evaluations- as if relying on affective arousal to indicate how strongly one feels about something.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An empirical example of this is findings of intensified evaluations under high affective arousal when watching advertisements.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gorn |first1=Gerald |last2=Tuan Pham |first2=Michel |last3=Yatming Sin |first3=Leo |title=When Arousal Influences Ad Evaluation and Valence Does Not (and Vice Versa) |journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology |date=January 2001 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=43–55 |doi=10.1207/S15327663JCP1101_4|citeseerx=10.1.1.558.636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisements with positive and negative affective tone were evaluated as more positive and negative respectively, under conditions of high affective arousal relative to under conditions of low affective arousal.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Attribution of affect===
Affect may be elicited by the stimulus or situation of relevance, which is referred to as integral affect.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Conversely, affect may be momentary and coincide in time with the presence of the relevant stimulus, but be unrelated to the stimulus. This is referred to as incidental affect. Integral affect provides meaningful, relevant information about a target stimulus on which a judgement or decision can be made. Incidental affect may lead to affective feelings being subsequently mis-attributed to the stimulus at hand and thus provide mistaken information about the stimulus, from which a mislead judgement or decision is formed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Research examples===
There is a variety of research investigating the influence of affect on judgement, and the misattribution of affect. One study in the area investigated affective valence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They induced positive and negative affective states based on a life event (happy versus sad), and the weather (sunny versus rainy). Induced positive affective states (good experiences, sunny weather) lead to more positive evaluations of ratings of general well-being, relative to in an induced negative affective state (sad experiences, rainy weather), which lead to more negative life evaluations. They also found that negative life evaluations from an induced negative affective state was removed when the state was induced to be attributed to an irrelevant source (not to life satisfaction). This misattribution did not occur when in an induced positive affective state. Their conclusion was that the results indicate that affective state indirectly influenced judgements of life satisfaction through the type of information conveyed by affective feelings associated with life satisfaction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwarz |first1=Norbert |last2=Clore |first2=Gerald L. |title=Mood, misattribution, and judgments of well-being: Informative and directive functions of affective states |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=1983 |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=513–523 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.45.3.513 |issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study in the area illustrates misattribution, and an effect of affective arousal on judgement.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dutton |first1=Donald G. |last2=Aron |first2=Arthur P. |title=Some evidence for heightened sexual attraction under conditions of high anxiety |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=1974 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=510–517 |doi=10.1037/h0037031 |language=en |issn=1939-1315|citeseerx=10.1.1.335.100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They induced high affective arousal in the experimental condition where participants had to cross a high bridge, and a low affective arousal state in the control condition where participants had to cross a low bridge. All participants were male, and met an attractive female demonstrator on the other side of the bridge. They found that participants in the induced high affective arousal condition contacted the attractive demonstrator after the experiment significantly more than those in the induced low affective arousal condition. Males with a high affective arousal state had amplified attraction to the woman, as they misattributed their feelings of arousal caused by the bridge, to feelings of affective arousal caused by the attractive woman.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Affect on cognitive processing==
Affect has been indicated to provide information about how benign versus problematic a situation or task is,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which is dependent on the type of affective reaction or arousal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Consequently, this influences the type of information processing style that is used to interpret the situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
===Affective reaction===
If the affect is attributed as a response to a situation or stimulus&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; then positive affect signals a benign situation&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; that promotes relational processing&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which involves primarily [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top down]] processing of information.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Clore, G. L., Wyer, R. J., Dienes, B., Gasper, K., Gohm, C., &amp; Isbell, L. (2001). Affective feelings as feedback: Some cognitive consequences. In L. L. Martin, G. L. Clore, L. L. Martin, G. L. Clore (Eds.) , Theories of mood and cognition: A user's guidebook (pp. 27-62). Mahwah, NJ, US: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, negative affect signals a problematic situation,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; inhibiting processing associated with positive affect&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and promoting referential processing&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which is associated primarily with [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom up]] processing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

====Global vs. local processing====
An example of the influence of affect on processing style is that of its influence on the use of a global versus a local focus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Positive affect is thought to induce a more [[Global precedence|global processing]] style (processing of wholes).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Conversely, negative affect reduces global processing and enhances a more local processing style (processing of parts or details).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gasper|first1=Karen|date=April 2004|title=Do you see what I see? Affect and visual information processing|journal=Cognition &amp; Emotion|volume=18|issue=3|pages=405–421|doi=10.1080/02699930341000068|issn=0269-9931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research in this area has illustrated that the informative influence of affective valence is dependent on the accessibility of these global and local processing styles. In situations when either a global or local style was more accessible, positive affect lead to a greater increase in global or local processing respectively, compared to negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huntsinger |first1=Jeffrey R. |last2=Clore |first2=Gerald L. |last3=Bar-Anan |first3=Yoav |title=Mood and global–local focus: Priming a local focus reverses the link between mood and global–local processing |journal=Emotion |date=2010 |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=722–726 |doi=10.1037/a0019356|pmid=21038956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stereotypical thought processing====
Affective valence has also been indicated to have informative effects on [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] thought processing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Positive affect is thought to lead to increased stereotypical thought processing, illustrated in research where participants in an induced positive mood were more likely than those in an induced neutral mood&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bodenhausen |first1=Galen V. |last2=Kramer |first2=Geoffrey P. |last3=Süsser |first3=Karin |title=Happiness and stereotypic thinking in social judgment |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=1994 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=621–632 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.4.621 |language=en |issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; or negative mood &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; to make a stereotypical judgement. This was suggested to be due to stereotypical thought elicited from the positive affect.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Additionally, negative affect has been demonstrated to lead to decreased stereotypical thought processing.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Park |first1=J |last2=Banaji |first2=MR |title=Mood and heuristics: the influence of happy and sad states on sensitivity and bias in stereotyping |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=June 2000 |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages=1005–23 |pmid=10870905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affective arousal===
As in the effect of arousal in judgement, affective arousal is proposed to intensify cognitive processing that has been induced as a result of information provided by affective valence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An illustration is that empirical research on false memories showed with high affective arousal, more false memories were produced within different valence conditions (positive, negative, neutral) than with low affective arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corson |first1=Y |last2=Verrier |first2=N |title=Emotions and false memories: valence or arousal? |journal=Psychological Science |date=March 2007 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=208–11 |pmid=17444912|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01874.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affect on memory==
===Affective reaction===
Affective arousal has predominantly been discussed with regard to the informative influence of affect on memory. However, the influence of affective valence on memory has been demonstrated in research, such as at [[memory retrieval]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ehrlichman |first1=H |last2=Halpern |first2=JN |title=Affect and memory: effects of pleasant and unpleasant odors on retrieval of happy and unhappy memories |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=November 1988 |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=769–79 |pmid=3210144}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was illustrated that after exposure to pleasant or unpleasant odours to induce positive or negative affective valence respectively, those with induced positive affect provided significantly more positive ratings (rated as happy memory) of a retrieved memory than those with induced negative affect.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Affective valence has also been implicated at memory [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bradley |first1=MM |last2=Greenwald |first2=MK |last3=Petry |first3=MC |last4=Lang |first4=PJ |title=Remembering pictures: pleasure and arousal in memory |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |date=March 1992 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=379–90 |pmid=1532823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affective arousal===
Affective arousal has been indicated to influence memory&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as it redirects or narrows attention towards potentially important or salient factors such as environmental stimuli,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; thus influencing what information gets encoded in to memory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As mentioned, this effect is mediated by implicit and explicit affective arousal responses, indicative of the level of importance in a situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Affective arousal has also been implicated in consolidation of [[long-term memory]] through the mediating effects of stress hormones of the adrenergic system on the [[amygdala]]- whose functions include [[memory consolidation]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamann |first1=S |title=Cognitive and neural mechanisms of emotional memory |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=1 September 2001 |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=394–400 |pmid=11520704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research example===
Empirical research investigating both affective valence and arousal found effects on different aspects of memory.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In their research, they investigated the effect of induced positive versus negative affective valence, and induced high and low arousal on memory encoding using picture slides, in a delayed (to assess long-term memory) and immediate free-recall task. In both free recall conditions, high arousal at encoding lead to better memory performance than low arousal at encoding. A similar finding occurred for affective valence where positive affect at encoding lead to better memory performance, however only for the immediate free-recall condition. They concluded that their results indicate the influence of both dimensions of affect at encoding, and involvement of affective arousal in long-term memory.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==History==
===Development of the early theory===
A researcher in the field of cognitive psychology by the name of [[Norbert Schwarz]] was interested in the informative function of feelings.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Schwarz, N. (2012). Feelings-as-information theory. In P. M. Van Lange, A. W. Kruglanski, E. T. Higgins, P. M. Van Lange, A. W. Kruglanski, E. T. Higgins (Eds.) , Handbook of theories of social psychology (pp. 289-308). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Ltd. doi:10.4135/9781446249215.n15&lt;/ref&gt; He commenced research alongside Robert Wyer and Gerald Clore. Building off the ideas of earlier works, one he summarised was that current feelings elicited increase the availability of information congruent with that feeling.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; He recognised that these ideas were developed upon by the earlier researchers; Isen, Shalker, Clark, and Karp (1978),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Isen |first1=AM |last2=Shalker |first2=TE |last3=Clark |first3=M |last4=Karp |first4=L |title=Affect, accessibility of material in memory, and behavior: a cognitive loop? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=January 1978 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |pmid=621625}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bower (1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bower |first1=GH |title=Mood and memory |journal=The American Psychologist |date=February 1981 |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=129–48 |pmid=7224324}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were researching affect and cognitive functioning. Additionally, the influential idea in this field stemming from the work of Wyer and Carlston (1979)&lt;ref&gt;Wyer, R.S. &amp; Carlston, D.E. (1979). Social cognition, inference, and attribution. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; was that a function of affect is to provide information about a target. Their investigation into the functions of feelings gave further insight into the informative functions of feelings, from which they derived core postulates of their theory.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Development of the theory and postulates derived are detailed and summarised in Schwarz’s (2010) ‘Feelings as information theory’.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1150">'''Auxesis''' (from the Greek word meaning increase; grow) refers to growth from an increase in [[cell size]] rather than an increase in the number of cells.  Auxetic growth occurs in certain tissues, such as [[muscle]], of the higher animals as well as in some organisms, such as [[nematode]]s, [[tunicate]]s, and [[rotifer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tutorvista.com/content/biology/biology-iv/growth-regeneration-ageing/growth-types.php Types of Growth: Auxetic Growth, Tutor Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Juo|first=Pei-show|title=Concise Dictionary of Biomedicine and Molecular Biology|publisher=CRC Press|date=21 December 2001|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4DLBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=auxesis+biology+research&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[plant physiology]], an auxetic substance will tend to increase [[cell growth]] without any [[cell division]]. [[Auxin]]s are auxetic [[plant hormone]]s.

'''Cargo cult science''' is a phrase describing practices that have the semblance of being [[Scientific method|scientific]], but do not in fact follow the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name='speech'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf |title=Cargo Cult Science|authorlink=Richard Feynman|last=Feynman|first= Richard P.|format=pdf|website= [[California Institute of Technology]] |date= June 1974 |accessdate= 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used by [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] during his 1974 [[commencement address]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="speech" /&gt;

[[Cargo cult]]s are religious practices that have appeared in many traditional [[tribe|tribal societies]] in the wake of interaction with technologically advanced cultures. They focus on obtaining the material wealth (the "cargo") of the advanced culture by imitating the actions they believe cause the appearance of cargo: by building landing strips, mock aircraft, mock radios, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witkowski|first1=Tomasz|title=Psychology Led Astray: Cargo Cult in Science and Therapy|date=2016|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=1627346090|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=jmC8DAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Cargo+cult+science&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, although cargo cult sciences employ the trappings of the scientific method, like an airplane with no motor, they fail to deliver anything of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Great Readings in Clinical Science: Essential Selections for Mental Health Professionals|last=Lilienfeld|first=Scott|last2=O'Donohue|first2=William|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|isbn=9780205698035|location=USA|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feynman's speech==
The speech is widely posted,{{clarify|date=May 2018|reason=on the Internet?}} and Feynman adapted it in his book ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]''. Feynman based the phrase on a concept in [[anthropology]], the [[cargo cult]], which describes how some pre-industrialized cultures interpreted technologically sophisticated visitors as religious or supernatural figures who brought boons of cargo. Later, in an effort to call for a second visit the natives would develop and engage in complex religious rituals, mirroring the previously observed behavior of the visitors manipulating their machines but without understanding the true nature of those tasks. Just as cargo cultists create mock airports that fail to produce airplanes, cargo cult scientists conduct flawed research that superficially resembles the scientific method, but which fails to produce scientifically useful results.

The following is an excerpt from a speech (taken from the book).
[[File:SouthChinaSea.png|thumb|Map showing "the South Seas"]]
[[File:John Frum flag raising.jpg|thumb|A ceremonial flag raising performed by members of the [[John Frum]] cargo cult on [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]] island.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they've arranged to imitate things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas—he's the controller—and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they're missing something essential, because the planes don't land.&lt;ref name="speech" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Feynman cautioned that to avoid becoming cargo cult scientists, researchers must avoid fooling themselves, be willing to question and doubt their own theories and their own results, and investigate possible flaws in a theory or an experiment. He recommended that researchers adopt an unusually high level of honesty which is rarely encountered in everyday life, and gave examples from advertising, politics, and [[psychology]] to illustrate the everyday dishonesty which should be unacceptable in science. Feynman cautioned,&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We've learned from experience that the truth will come out. Other experimenters will repeat your experiment and find out whether you were wrong or right. Nature's phenomena will agree or they'll disagree with your theory. And, although you may gain some temporary fame and excitement, you will not gain a good reputation as a scientist if you haven't tried to be very careful in this kind of work. And it's this type of integrity, this kind of care not to fool yourself, that is missing to a large extent in much of the research in cargo cult science.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An example of cargo cult science is an experiment that uses another researcher's results in lieu of an [[experimental control]]. Since the other researcher's conditions might differ from those of the present experiment in unknown ways, differences in the outcome might have no relation to the [[independent variable]] under consideration. Other examples, given by Feynman, are from [[educational research]], [[psychology]] (particularly [[parapsychology]]), and [[physics]]. He also mentions other kinds of dishonesty, for example, falsely promoting one's research to secure funding. Feynman believed a scientist of integrity must attempt to give out as much information as possible about their experiments so others could accurately appraise their contribution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Great Readings in Clinical Science: Essential Selections for Mental Health Professionals|last=Lilienfeld|first=Scott|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=978-0-205-69803-5|location=New Jersey|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in specific experiments and results==
* [[Oil drop experiment]]: The history of published results for this experiment is an example given in ''Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!'', in which each new publication slowly and quietly drifted more and more away from the initial (erroneous) values given by [[Robert Millikan]] toward the correct value, rather than all having a random distribution from the start around what is now believed to be the correct result. This slow drift in the chronological history of results is unnatural and suggests that nobody wanted to contradict the previous one, instead submitting only concordant results for publication.

== Proposed solutions ==
In his commencement address, Richard Feynman stated his belief that the antidote to both cargo cult science and [[pseudoscience]] is scientific integrity, which he describes as, "a kind of leaning over backwards" to make sure scientists do not fool themselves or others. According to Feynman an ethical scientist must make the extra effort to ensure that their methods and results are transparent, allowing other people to accurately appraise and understand the scientist's research. Feynman uses the case of a [[Wesson cooking oil]] advertisement as an example of an unethical and deceptive use of science that delivers nothing of value. The advertisement made the claim that the oil would not soak through food. In reality no oil will soak through food if it is cold enough, and all oil will soak through food if hot enough. Since these facts would not advance Wesson's agenda, these facts were not made readily available for consumers.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/720560483|title=Great readings in clinical science : essential selections for mental health professionals|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|others=Lilienfeld, Scott O., 1960-, O'Donohue, William T.|isbn=0205698034|location=Boston|oclc=720560483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eighth chapter of his book ''Interpreting Biomedical Science,'' Ülo Maiväli presents some possible solutions to the perceived prevalence of cargo cult science. These proposed solutions are as follows: the integration, or the making whole or of science, a more philosophical approach to science, training that instills values of common ownership, egalitarianism and disinterestedness, and a system that distances scientists from economical temptation and scarcity. This system would reduce the amount of graduate studies and graduate students to reduce funding pressures. Ideally this would give researchers the financial support to be honest and innovative. Maiväli postulates that honesty is more important than methodology, and is the most effective antidote to cargo cult science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/911179264|title=Interpreting biomedical science : experiment, evidence, and belief|last=Ülo,|first=Maiväli,|isbn=9780124186897|location=London|oclc=911179264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlo Willem Joannes Beenakker''' (born June 9, 1960) is a professor at [[Leiden University]] and leader of the university's [[mesoscopic]] [[physics]] group, established in 1992.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Leiden]] as the son of physicists {{Interlanguage link multi|Jan Beenakker|nl}} and Elena Manaresi,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrcreader.nl/artikel/6319/ik-wil-zo-dicht-mogelijk-bij-onsterfelijkheid-komen&lt;/ref&gt; Beenakker graduated from Leiden University in 1982 and obtained his doctorate two years later.

==Career==
After the awarding of his doctorate, he then spent one year working in the [[United States of America]] as a fellow of the Niels Stensen Foundation before returning to the Netherlands as a member of the scientific staff of the [[Philips]] Research Laboratories in [[Eindhoven]]. He was made External Professor of [[theoretical physics|Theoretical Physics]] at Leiden in 1991.

His work in mesoscopic physics addresses fundamental physical problems that occur when a [[macroscopic]] object is miniaturized.

In 1993, he shared the Royal/Shell prize for "the discovery and explanation of quantum effects in the [[electrical conduction]] in mesoscopic systems". He was elected a member of the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities in 2001, and the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/5076 |title=Carlo Beenakker |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded one of the Netherlands' most prestigious science awards, the [[Spinozapremie]], in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/spinoza+prize/spinoza+laureates/overview+by+year/1999 |title=NWO Spinoza Prize 1999 |publisher=Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research |date=11 September 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he was honored with the [[AkzoNobel]] Science Award "for his pioneering work in the field of [[nanoscience]]".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In a 1997 study by the Institute for Scientific Information, Beenakker rated in the top 300 most cited physicists of the previous 16 years.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 2008, Beenakker attended the 24th [[Solvay Conference]] on Physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/Solvay/solvay.html Lorentz &amp; the Solvay conferences], Instituut-Lorentz, Leiden University&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ceramic engineering''' is the science and technology of creating objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials. This is done either by the action of heat, or at lower temperatures using precipitation reactions from high-purity chemical solutions. The term includes the purification of raw materials, the study and production of the chemical compounds concerned, their formation into components and the study of their structure, composition and properties.

[[Ceramic materials]] may have a crystalline or partly crystalline structure, with long-range order on atomic scale. Glass ceramics may have an amorphous or glassy structure, with limited or short-range atomic order. They are either formed from a molten mass that solidifies on cooling, formed and matured by the action of heat, or chemically synthesized at low temperatures using, for example, [[hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal]] or [[sol-gel]] synthesis.

The special character of ceramic materials gives rise to many applications in [[materials engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[chemical engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]]. As ceramics are heat resistant, they can be used for many tasks for which materials like metal and [[polymers]] are unsuitable. Ceramic materials are used in a wide range of industries, including mining, aerospace, medicine, refinery, food and chemical industries, packaging science, electronics, industrial and transmission electricity, and guided lightwave transmission.&lt;ref name="KBU"&gt;Kingery, W.D., Bowen, H.K., and Uhlmann, D.R., ''Introduction to Ceramics'', p. 690 (Wiley-Interscience, 2nd Edition, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The word "[[ceramic]]" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word κεραμικός (''keramikos'') meaning [[pottery]]. It is related to the older [[Indo-European language]] root "to burn",
&lt;ref name=hippel&gt;
{{cite book|author1=von Hippel |author2=A. R. | chapter= Ceramics| title = Dielectric Materials and Applications| publisher = Technology Press (M.I.T.) and John Wiley &amp; Sons| year = 1954| isbn = 1-58053-123-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
"Ceramic" may be used as a noun in the singular to refer to a ceramic material or the product of ceramic manufacture, or as an adjective. The plural "ceramics" may be used to refer the making of things out of ceramic materials. Ceramic engineering, like many sciences, evolved from a different discipline by today's standards. Materials science engineering is grouped with ceramics engineering to this day.

[[File:Sabbiatrice.jpg|thumb|Leo Morandi's tile glazing line (circa 1945)]]

Abraham Darby first used [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] in 1709 in Shropshire, England, to improve the yield of a smelting process. Coke is now widely used to produce carbide ceramics. Potter [[Josiah Wedgwood]] opened the first modern ceramics factory in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], England, in 1759. Austrian chemist [[Carl Josef Bayer]], working for the textile industry in Russia, developed a [[Bayer process|process]] to separate [[alumina]] from [[bauxite]] ore in 1888. The Bayer process is still used to purify alumina for the ceramic and aluminium industries. Brothers Pierre and Jacques [[Pierre Curie|Curie]] discovered [[piezoelectricity]] in Rochelle salt circa 1880. Piezoelectricity is one of the key properties of [[electroceramics]].

[[Edward Goodrich Acheson|E.G. Acheson]] heated a mixture of coke and [[clay]] in 1893, and invented carborundum, or synthetic [[silicon carbide]]. [[Henri Moissan]] also synthesized SiC and [[tungsten carbide]] in his [[electric arc furnace]] in Paris about the same time as Acheson. Karl Schröter used liquid-phase [[sintering]] to bond or "cement" Moissan's tungsten carbide particles with cobalt in 1923 in Germany. Cemented (metal-bonded) [[carbide]] edges greatly increase the durability of [[hardened steel]] cutting tools. [[Walther Nernst|W.H. Nernst]] developed [[Cubic zirconia|cubic-stabilized zirconia]] in the 1920s in Berlin. This material is used as an oxygen sensor in exhaust systems. The main limitation on the use of ceramics in engineering is brittleness.

=== Military ===

[[File:Nightvision.jpg|thumb|Soldiers pictured during the [[2003 Iraq War]] seen through IR transparent Night Vision Goggles]]

The [[military]] requirements of [[World War II]] encouraged developments, which created a need for high-performance materials and helped speed the development of ceramic science and engineering. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, new types of ceramics were developed in response to advances in atomic energy, electronics, communications, and space travel. The discovery of ceramic superconductors in 1986 has spurred intense research to develop superconducting ceramic parts for electronic devices, electric motors, and transportation equipment.

There is an increasing need in the military sector for high-strength, robust materials which have the capability to transmit light around the visible (0.4–0.7 micrometers) and mid-infrared (1–5 micrometers) regions of the spectrum. These materials are needed for applications requiring [[transparent armour]]. Transparent armor is a material or system of materials designed to be optically transparent, yet protect from fragmentation or ballistic impacts. The primary requirement for a transparent armour system is to not only defeat the designated threat but also provide a multi-hit capability with minimized distortion of surrounding areas. Transparent armour windows must also be compatible with night vision equipment. New materials that are thinner, lightweight, and offer better ballistic performance are being sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1117/12.405270|title=Proceedings of SPIE|chapter=Transparent ceramics for armour and EM window applications|year=2000|last1=Patel|first1=Parimal J.|volume=4102|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such solid-state components have found widespread use for various applications in the electro-optical field including: [[fibre optics|optical fibres]] for guided lightwave transmission, [[optical]] [[switches]], laser [[amplifiers]] and [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], hosts for solid-state [[lasers]] and optical window materials for gas lasers, and [[Infrared homing|infrared (IR) heat seeking devices]] for [[missile guidance]] systems and [[night vision devices|IR night vision]].

== Modern industry ==

Now a multibillion-dollar a year industry, ceramic engineering and research has established itself as an important field of science. Applications continue to expand as researchers develop new kinds of ceramics to serve different purposes.&lt;ref name="KBU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MOD"&gt;Richerson, D.W., ''Modern Ceramic Engineering'', 2nd Ed., (Marcel Dekker Inc., 1992) {{ISBN|0-8247-8634-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Zirconium dioxide]] ceramics are used in the manufacture of knives. The blade of the [[ceramic knife]] will stay sharp for much longer than that of a steel knife, although it is more brittle and can be snapped by dropping it on a hard surface.
*Ceramics such as alumina, [[boron carbide]] and silicon carbide have been used in [[bulletproof vest]]s to repel small arms [[rifle]] fire. Such plates are known commonly as [[trauma plate]]s. Similar material is used to protect [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpits]] of some military aircraft, because of the low weight of the material.
*[[Silicon nitride]] parts are used in ceramic ball bearings. Their higher hardness means that they are much less susceptible to wear and can offer more than triple lifetimes. They also deform less under load meaning they have less contact with the bearing retainer walls and can roll faster. In very high speed applications, heat from friction during rolling can cause problems for metal bearings; problems which are reduced by the use of ceramics. Ceramics are also more chemically resistant and can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would rust. The major drawback to using ceramics is a significantly higher cost. In many cases their electrically insulating properties may also be valuable in bearings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
*In the early 1980s, [[Toyota]] researched production of an [[adiabatic]] ceramic engine which can run at a temperature of over 6000&amp;nbsp;°F (3300&amp;nbsp;°C). Ceramic engines do not require a cooling system and hence allow a major weight reduction and therefore greater fuel efficiency. [[Fuel efficiency]] of the engine is also higher at high temperature, as shown by [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot's]] theorem. In a conventional metallic engine, much of the energy released from the fuel must be dissipated as [[waste heat]] in order to prevent a meltdown of the metallic parts. Despite all of these desirable properties, such engines are not in production because the manufacturing of ceramic parts in the requisite precision and durability is difficult. Imperfection in the ceramic leads to cracks, which can lead to potentially dangerous equipment failure. Such engines are possible in laboratory settings, but mass-production is not feasible with current technology.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
*Work is being done in developing ceramic parts for [[gas turbine]] [[heat engine|engines]]. Currently, even blades made of [[superalloy|advanced metal alloys]] used in the engines' hot section require cooling and careful limiting of operating temperatures. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

*Recently, there have been advances in ceramics which include bio-ceramics, such as dental implants and synthetic bones. [[Hydroxyapatite]], the natural mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically from a number of biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials. Orthopaedic implants made from these materials bond readily to bone and other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions. Because of this, they are of great interest for gene delivery and [[tissue engineering]] scaffolds. Most hydroxyapatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical strength and are used to coat metal orthopaedic devices to aid in forming a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for orthopaedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to make strong, fully dense nano crystalline hydroxyapatite ceramic materials for orthopaedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and plastic orthopaedic materials with a synthetic, but naturally occurring, bone mineral. Ultimately these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein collagens, synthetic bones.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
*Durable actinide-containing ceramic materials have many applications such as in nuclear fuels for burning excess Pu and in chemically-inert sources of alpha irradiation for power supply of unmanned space vehicles or to produce electricity for microelectronic devices. Both use and disposal of radioactive actinides require their immobilisation in a durable host material. Nuclear waste long-lived radionuclides such as actinides are immobilised using chemically-durable crystalline materials based on polycrystalline ceramics and large single crystals.&lt;ref&gt;B.E.

*High-tech ceramic is used in watch-making for producing watch cases. The material is valued by watchmakers for its light weight, scratch-resistance, durability and smooth touch. [[International Watch Company|IWC]] is one of the brands that initiated the use of ceramic in watch-making. The case of the IWC 2007 Top Gun edition of the Pilot's Watch [[Double chronograph]] is crafted in high-tech black ceramic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watches.infoniac.com/index.php?page=post&amp;id=62 Ceramic in Watch-making].

== Glass-ceramics ==
[[File:Glass ceramic cooktop.jpg|thumb|A high strength glass-ceramic cook-top with negligible thermal expansion.]]

Glass-ceramic materials share many properties with both glasses and ceramics. Glass-ceramics have an amorphous phase and one or more crystalline phases and are produced by a so-called "controlled crystallization", which is typically avoided in glass manufacturing. Glass-ceramics often contain a crystalline phase which constitutes anywhere from 30% [m/m] to 90% [m/m] of its composition by volume, yielding an array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties.&lt;ref name="MOD" /&gt;

In the processing of glass-ceramics, molten glass is cooled down gradually before reheating and annealing. In this heat treatment the glass partly [[crystallizes]]. In many cases, so-called 'nucleation agents' are added in order to regulate and control the crystallization process. Because there is usually no pressing and sintering, glass-ceramics do not contain the volume fraction of porosity typically present in sintered ceramics.&lt;ref name="KBU" /&gt;

The term mainly refers to a mix of lithium and [[aluminosilicate]]s which yields an array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties. The most commercially important of these have the distinction of being impervious to thermal shock. Thus, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking. The negative [[thermal expansion]] coefficient (TEC) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive TEC of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net TEC near zero. This type of [[glass-ceramic]] exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="KBU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MOD" /&gt;

==Processing steps==

The traditional ceramic process generally follows this sequence: Milling → Batching → Mixing → Forming → Drying → Firing → Assembly.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ball mill.gif|thumb|[[Ball mill]]]]

*'''Milling''' is the process by which materials are reduced from a large size to a smaller size. Milling may involve breaking up cemented material (in which case individual particles retain their shape) or pulverization (which involves grinding the particles themselves to a smaller size). Milling is generally done by mechanical means, including ''attrition'' (which is particle-to-particle collision that results in agglomerate break up or particle shearing), ''compression'' (which applies a forces that results in fracturing), and ''impact'' (which employs a milling medium or the particles themselves to cause fracturing). Attrition milling equipment includes the wet scrubber (also called the planetary mill or wet attrition mill), which has paddles in water creating vortexes in which the material collides and break up. Compression mills include the jaw [[crusher]], roller crusher and cone crusher. Impact mills include the [[ball mill]], which has media that tumble and fracture the material. Shaft impactors cause particle-to particle attrition and compression.
*'''Batching''' is the process of weighing the oxides according to recipes, and preparing them for mixing and drying.
*'''Mixing''' occurs after batching and is performed with various machines, such as dry mixing [[Industrial mixer|ribbon mixers]] (a type of cement mixer), Mueller mixers,{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} and [[pug mill]]s. Wet mixing generally involves the same equipment.
*'''Forming''' is making the mixed material into shapes, ranging from toilet bowls to spark plug insulators. Forming can involve: (1) Extrusion, such as extruding "slugs" to make bricks, (2) Pressing to make shaped parts, (3) [[slipcasting|Slip casting]], as in making toilet bowls, wash basins and ornamentals like ceramic statues. Forming produces a "green" part, ready for drying. Green parts are soft, pliable, and over time will lose shape. Handling the green product will change its shape. For example, a green brick can be "squeezed", and after squeezing it will stay that way.
*'''Drying''' is removing the water or binder from the formed material. [[Spray drying]] is widely used to prepare powder for pressing operations. Other dryers are tunnel dryers and periodic dryers. Controlled heat is applied in this two-stage process. First, heat removes water. This step needs careful control, as rapid heating causes cracks and surface defects. The dried part is smaller than the green part, and is brittle, necessitating careful handling, since a small impact will cause crumbling and breaking.
*'''Sintering''' is where the dried parts pass through a controlled heating process, and the oxides are chemically changed to cause bonding and densification. The fired part will be smaller than the dried part.

==Forming methods==

[[Ceramic forming techniques]] include throwing, [[slipcasting]], tape casting, [[freeze-casting]], injection moulding, dry pressing, isostatic pressing, hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and others. Methods for forming ceramic powders into complex shapes are desirable in many areas of technology. Such methods are required for producing advanced, high-temperature structural parts such as heat engine components and [[turbines]]. Materials other than ceramics which are used in these processes may include: wood, metal, water, plaster and epoxy—most of which will be eliminated upon firing.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

These forming techniques are well known for providing tools and other components with dimensional stability, surface quality, high (near theoretical) density and microstructural uniformity. The increasing use and diversity of speciality forms of ceramics adds to the diversity of process technologies to be used.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

Thus, reinforcing fibres and filaments are mainly made by polymer, sol-gel, or CVD processes, but melt processing also has applicability. The most widely used speciality form is layered structures, with tape casting for electronic substrates and packages being pre-eminent. Photo-lithography is of increasing interest for precise patterning of conductors and other components for such packaging. Tape casting or forming processes are also of increasing interest for other applications, ranging from open structures such as fuel cells to ceramic composites.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

The other major layer structure is coating, where melt spraying is very important, but chemical and physical vapour deposition and chemical (e.g., sol-gel and polymer pyrolysis) methods are all seeing increased use. Besides open structures from formed tape, extruded structures, such as honeycomb catalyst supports, and highly porous structures, including various foams, for example, [[reticulated foam]], are of increasing use.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

Densification of consolidated powder bodies continues to be achieved predominantly by (pressureless) sintering. However, the use of pressure sintering by hot pressing is increasing, especially for non-oxides and parts of simple shapes where higher quality (mainly microstructural homogeneity) is needed, and larger size or multiple parts per pressing can be an advantage.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

== The sintering process ==

{{See also|Sintering#Sintering mechanisms|l1=Sintering mechanisms}}

The principles of sintering-based methods are simple ("sinter" has roots in the English "[[cinder]]"). The firing is done at a temperature below the melting point of the ceramic. Once a roughly-held-together object called a "green body" is made, it is baked in a [[kiln]], where atomic and molecular [[diffusion]] processes give rise to significant changes in the primary microstructural features. This includes the gradual elimination of [[porosity]], which is typically accompanied by a net shrinkage and overall [[densification]] of the component. Thus, the pores in the object may close up, resulting in a denser product of significantly greater [[Strength of materials|strength]] and [[fracture toughness]].

Another major change in the body during the firing or sintering process will be the establishment of the [[polycrystalline]] nature of the solid. This change will introduce some form of [[grain]] size distribution, which will have a significant impact on the ultimate [[physical properties]] of the material. The grain sizes will either be associated with the initial [[particle size]], or possibly the sizes of aggregates or particle [[cluster (physics)|cluster]]s which arise during the initial stages of processing.

The ultimate [[microstructure]] (and thus the physical properties) of the final product will be limited by and subject to the form of the structural template or precursor which is created in the initial stages of [[chemical synthesis]] and physical forming. Hence the importance of chemical [[Powder (substance)|powder]] and [[polymer]] [[Chemical process|processing]] as it pertains to the synthesis of industrial ceramics, glasses and glass-ceramics.

There are numerous possible refinements of the sintering process. Some of the most common involve pressing the green body to give the densification a head start and reduce the sintering time needed. Sometimes organic [[binder (material)|binders]] such as [[polyvinyl alcohol]] are added to hold the green body together; these burn out during the firing (at 200–350&amp;nbsp;°C). Sometimes organic lubricants are added during pressing to increase densification. It is common to combine these, and add binders and lubricants to a powder, then press. (The formulation of these organic chemical additives is an art in itself. This is particularly important in the manufacture of high performance ceramics such as those used by the billions for [[electronics]], in capacitors, [[inductor]]s, [[sensor]]s, etc.)

A slurry can be used in place of a powder, and then cast into a desired shape, dried and then sintered. Indeed, traditional pottery is done with this type of method, using a plastic mixture worked with the hands. If a mixture of different materials is used together in a ceramic, the sintering temperature is sometimes above the melting point of one minor component – a ''liquid phase'' sintering. This results in shorter sintering times compared to solid state sintering.&lt;ref&gt;Rahaman, M.N., ''Ceramic Processing and Sintering'', 2nd Ed. (Marcel Dekker Inc., 2003) {{ISBN|0-8247-0988-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strength of ceramics==
A material's strength is dependent on its microstructure. The engineering processes to which a material is subjected can alter its microstructure. The variety of strengthening mechanisms that alter the strength of a material include the mechanism of [[grain boundary strengthening]]. Thus, although yield strength is maximized with decreasing grain size, ultimately, very small grain sizes make the material brittle. Considered in tandem with the fact that the yield strength is the parameter that predicts plastic deformation in the material, one can make informed decisions on how to increase the strength of a material depending on its microstructural properties and the desired end effect.

The relation between yield stress and grain size is described mathematically by the Hall-Petch equation which is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_y = \sigma_0 + {k_y \over \sqrt {d}}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the strengthening coefficient (a constant unique to each material), ''σ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a materials constant for the starting stress for dislocation movement (or the resistance of the lattice to dislocation motion), ''d'' is the grain diameter, and ''σ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the yield stress.

Theoretically, a material could be made infinitely strong if the grains are made infinitely small. This is, unfortunately, impossible because the lower limit of grain size is a single [[unit cell]] of the material. Even then, if the grains of a material are the size of a single unit cell, then the material is in fact amorphous, not crystalline, since there is no long range order, and dislocations can not be defined in an amorphous material. It has been observed experimentally that the microstructure with the highest yield strength is a grain size of about 10 nanometres, because grains smaller than this undergo another yielding mechanism, grain boundary sliding.&lt;ref name="Grain boundary sliding"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schuh|first=Christopher |author2=Nieh, T.G. |year=2002|doi=10.1557/PROC-740-I1.8|title=Hardness and Abrasion Resistance of Nanocrystalline Nickel Alloys Near the Hall-Petch Breakdown Regime|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/p014240.pdf |journal=Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. |volume=740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producing engineering materials with this ideal grain size is difficult because of the limitations of initial particle sizes inherent to [[nanomaterials]] and nanotechnology.

==Theory of chemical processing==

===Microstructural uniformity===
In the processing of fine ceramics, the irregular particle sizes and shapes in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing [[density]] variations in the powder compact. Uncontrolled [[Flocculation|agglomeration]] of powders due to attractive [[van der Waals forces]] can also give rise to in microstructural inhomogeneities.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite book

Differential stresses that develop as a result of non-uniform drying shrinkage are directly related to the rate at which the [[solvent]] can be removed, and thus highly dependent upon the distribution of porosity. Such stresses have been associated with a plastic-to-brittle transition in consolidated bodies,&lt;ref name="C"&gt;{{cite journal

and can yield to [[crack propagation]] in the unfired body if not relieved.

In addition, any fluctuations in packing density in the compact as it is prepared for the kiln are often amplified during the sintering process, yielding inhomogeneous densification.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;{{cite journal

Differential stresses arising from inhomogeneous densification have also been shown to result in the propagation of internal cracks, thus becoming the strength-controlling flaws.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Evans, A.G.|journal=J.

It would therefore appear desirable to process a material in such a way that it is physically uniform with regard to the distribution of components and porosity, rather than using particle size distributions which will maximize the green density. The containment of a uniformly dispersed assembly of strongly interacting particles in suspension requires total control over particle-particle interactions. [[Monodisperse]] [[colloid]]s provide this potential.&lt;ref name="J"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monodisperse powders of colloidal [[silica]], for example, may therefore be stabilized sufficiently to ensure a high degree of order in the [[colloidal crystal]] or polycrystalline colloidal solid which results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whitesides, G.M.

Such defective polycrystalline colloidal structures would appear to be the basic elements of submicrometer colloidal [[materials science]], and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in inorganic systems such as polycrystalline ceramics.

=== Self-assembly ===

[[File:Host Guest Complex Nanocapsule Science Year2005 Vol309 Page2037.jpg|thumbnail|An example of a supramolecular assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|year=2005|volume=309|doi=10.1126/science.1116579|title=Fluorescent Guest Molecules Report Ordered Inner Phase of Host Capsules in Solution|last1=Dalgarno|first1=S.

[[Self-assembly]] is the most common term in use in the modern scientific community to describe the spontaneous aggregation of particles (atoms, molecules, colloids, micelles, etc.) without the influence of any external forces. Large groups of such particles are known to assemble themselves into [[thermodynamic]]ally stable, structurally well-defined arrays, quite reminiscent of one of the 7 [[crystal]] systems found in [[metallurgy]] and [[mineralogy]] (e.g. [[face-centred cubic]], [[body-centred cubic]], etc.).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  The fundamental difference in equilibrium structure is in the spatial scale of the unit cell (or [[lattice parameter]]) in each particular case.

Thus, self-assembly is emerging as a new strategy in chemical synthesis and [[nanotechnology]]. [[Molecular]] self-assembly has been observed in various [[biological]] systems and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. Molecular crystals, liquid crystals, colloids, micelles, [[emulsions]], phase-separated polymers, thin films and self-assembled monolayers all represent examples of the types of highly ordered structures which are obtained using these techniques. The distinguishing feature of these methods is self-organization in the absence of any external forces.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In addition, the principal mechanical characteristics and structures of biological ceramics, polymer [[Composite material|composites]], [[elastomers]], and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] materials are being re-evaluated, with an emphasis on bioinspired materials and structures. Traditional approaches focus on design methods of biological materials using conventional synthetic materials. This includes an emerging class of [[Mechanics|mechanically]] superior [[biomaterials]] based on microstructural features and designs found in nature. The new horizons have been identified in the synthesis of bioinspired materials through processes that are characteristic of biological systems in nature. This includes the nanoscale self-assembly of the components and the development of [[hierarchical]] structures.&lt;ref name="K"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ariga&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/1468-6996/9/1/014109| pmid = 27877935| title = Challenges and breakthroughs in recent research on self-assembly| journal = Science and Technology of Advanced Materials| volume = 9| issue = 1| pages = 014109| year = 2008| last1 = Ariga | first1 = K. | last2 = Hill | first2 = J.

==Ceramic composites==

[[File:PCCB Brake Carrera GT.jpg|thumb|The Porsche Carrera GT's carbon-ceramic (silicon carbide) composite [[disc brake]]]]
Substantial interest has arisen in recent years in fabricating ceramic composites. While there is considerable interest in composites with one or more non-ceramic constituents, the greatest attention is on composites in which all constituents are ceramic. These typically comprise two ceramic constituents: a continuous matrix, and a dispersed phase of ceramic particles, whiskers, or short (chopped) or [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|continuous ceramic fibres]]. The challenge, as in wet chemical processing, is to obtain a uniform or homogeneous distribution of the dispersed particle or fibre phase.&lt;ref name="COMP"&gt;Hull, D. and Clyne, T.W. (1996) ''An Introduction to Composite Materials''. Cambridge Solid State Science Series, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="DES"&gt;Barbero, E.J. (2010) ''Introduction to Composite Materials Design'', 2nd Edn., CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider first the processing of particulate composites. The particulate phase of greatest interest is tetragonal zirconia because of the toughening that can be achieved from the [[Phase transformations in solids|phase transformation]] from the metastable tetragonal to the monoclinic crystalline phase, aka [[transformation toughening]]. There is also substantial interest in dispersion of hard, non-oxide phases such as SiC, TiB, TiC, [[boron]], [[carbon]] and especially oxide matrices like alumina and [[mullite]]. There is also interest too incorporating other ceramic particulates, especially those of highly anisotropic thermal expansion. Examples include Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, graphite, and boron nitride.&lt;ref name="COMP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DES" /&gt;

[[File:SiC p1390066.jpg|thumb|right|[[Silicon carbide]] single crystal]]

In processing particulate composites, the issue is not only homogeneity of the size and spatial distribution of the dispersed and matrix phases, but also control of the matrix grain size. However, there is some built-in self-control due to inhibition of matrix grain growth by the dispersed phase. Particulate composites, though generally offer increased resistance to damage, failure, or both, are still quite sensitive to inhomogeneities of composition as well as other processing defects such as pores. Thus they need good processing to be effective.&lt;ref name="KBU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MOD" /&gt;

Particulate composites have been made on a commercial basis by simply mixing powders of the two constituents. Although this approach is inherently limited in the homogeneity that can be achieved, it is the most readily adaptable for existing ceramic production technology. However, other approaches are of interest.&lt;ref name="KBU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MOD" /&gt;

[[File:Tungsten carbide.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tungsten carbide]] milling bits]]

From the technological standpoint, a particularly desirable approach to fabricating particulate composites is to coat the matrix or its precursor onto fine particles of the dispersed phase with good control of the starting dispersed particle size and the resultant matrix coating thickness. One should in principle be able to achieve the ultimate in homogeneity of distribution and thereby optimize composite performance. This can also have other ramifications, such as allowing more useful composite performance to be achieved in a body having porosity, which might be desired for other factors, such as limiting thermal conductivity.

There are also some opportunities to utilize melt processing for fabrication of ceramic, particulate, whisker and short-fibre, and continuous-fibre composites. Clearly, both particulate and whisker composites are conceivable by solid-state precipitation after solidification of the melt. This can also be obtained in some cases by sintering, as for precipitation-toughened, partially stabilized zirconia. Similarly, it is known that one can directionally solidify ceramic eutectic mixtures and hence obtain uniaxially aligned fibre composites. Such composite processing has typically been limited to very simple shapes and thus suffers from serious economic problems due to high machining costs.&lt;ref name="COMP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DES" /&gt;

Clearly, there are possibilities of using melt casting for many of these approaches. Potentially even more desirable is using melt-derived particles. In this method, quenching is done in a solid solution or in a fine eutectic structure, in which the particles are then processed by more typical ceramic powder processing methods into a useful body. There have also been preliminary attempts to use melt spraying as a means of forming composites by introducing the dispersed particulate, whisker, or fibre phase in conjunction with the melt spraying process.

Other methods besides melt infiltration to manufacture ceramic composites with long fibre reinforcement are [[chemical vapour infiltration]] and the infiltration of fibre [[Optical fibre#Preform|preform]]s with organic [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]], which after [[pyrolysis]] yield an [[amorphous]] ceramic matrix, initially with a low density. With repeated cycles of infiltration and pyrolysis one of those types of [[ceramic matrix composite]]s is produced. Chemical vapour infiltration is used to manufacture [[carbon/carbon]] and silicon carbide reinforced with [[carbon fibre|carbon]] or [[silicon carbide fibre]]s.

Besides many process improvements, the first of two major needs for fibre composites is lower fibre costs. The second major need is fibre compositions or coatings, or composite processing, to reduce degradation that results from high-temperature composite exposure under oxidizing conditions.&lt;ref name="COMP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DES" /&gt;

==Applications==

[[File:Si3N4thruster.jpg|thumb|Silicon nitride thruster. Left: Mounted in test stand. Right: Being tested with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; propellants]]

The products of technical ceramics include tiles used in the [[Space Shuttle program]], gas burner [[nozzle]]s, [[Ballistic vest|ballistic protection]], nuclear fuel uranium oxide pellets, [[Implant (medicine)|bio-medical implants]], [[jet engine]] [[turbine]] blades, and [[missile]] nose cones.

Its products are often made from materials other than clay, chosen for their particular physical properties. These may be classified as follows:

*[[Oxide]]s: silica, alumina, [[zirconia]]
*Non-oxides: carbides, [[boride]]s, [[nitride]]s, [[silicide]]s
*[[Mixture|Composite]]s: particulate or whisker reinforced matrices, combinations of oxides and non-oxides (e.g. polymers).

Ceramics can be used in many technological industries. One application is the ceramic tiles on [[NASA]]'s Space Shuttle, used to protect it and the future supersonic space planes from the searing heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. They are also used widely in electronics and optics. In addition to the applications listed here, ceramics are also used as a coating in various engineering cases. An example would be a ceramic bearing coating over a titanium frame used for an aircraft. Recently the field has come to include the studies of single crystals or glass fibres, in addition to traditional polycrystalline materials, and the applications of these have been overlapping and changing rapidly.

Silicification is quite common in the biological world and occurs in bacteria, single-celled organisms, plants, and animals (invertebrates and vertebrates). Crystalline minerals formed in such environment often show exceptional physical properties (e.g. strength, hardness, fracture toughness) and tend to form hierarchical structures that exhibit microstructural order over a range of length or spatial scales. The minerals are crystallized from an environment that is undersaturated with respect to silicon, and under conditions of neutral pH and low temperature (0–40&amp;nbsp;°C). Formation of the mineral may occur either within or outside of the cell wall of an organism, and specific biochemical reactions for mineral deposition exist that include lipids, proteins and carbohydrates.

Most natural (or biological) materials are complex composites whose mechanical properties are often outstanding, considering the weak constituents from which they are assembled. These complex structures, which have risen from hundreds of million years of evolution, are inspiring the design of novel materials with exceptional physical properties for high performance in adverse conditions. Their defining characteristics such as hierarchy, multifunctionality, and the capacity for self-healing, are currently being investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Perry, C.C.|title=Silicification: The Processes by Which Organisms Capture and Mineralize Silica|journal=Rev. Miner. Geochem.|volume=54|page=291|year=2003|doi=10.2113/0540291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic building blocks begin with the 20 amino acids and proceed to polypeptides, polysaccharides, and polypeptides–saccharides. These, in turn, compose the basic proteins, which are the primary constituents of the ‘soft tissues’ common to most biominerals. With well over 1000 proteins possible, current research emphasizes the use of collagen, chitin, keratin, and elastin. The ‘hard’ phases are often strengthened by crystalline minerals, which nucleate and grow in a biomediated environment that determines the size, shape and distribution of individual crystals. The most important mineral phases have been identified as hydroxyapatite, silica, and [[aragonite]]. Using the classification of Wegst and Ashby, the principal mechanical characteristics and structures of biological ceramics, polymer composites, elastomers, and cellular materials have been presented. Selected systems in each class are being investigated with emphasis on the relationship between their microstructure over a range of length scales and their mechanical response.

Thus, the crystallization of inorganic materials in nature generally occurs at ambient temperature and pressure. Yet the vital organisms through which these minerals form are capable of consistently producing extremely precise and complex structures. Understanding the processes in which living organisms control the growth of crystalline minerals such as silica could lead to significant advances in the field of materials science, and open the door to novel synthesis techniques for nanoscale composite materials, or nanocomposites.

[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|The iridescent nacre inside a [[Nautilus]] shell.]]
High-resolution SEM observations were performed of the microstructure of the mother-of-pearl (or [[nacre]]) portion of the [[abalone]] shell. Those shells exhibit the highest mechanical strength and fracture toughness of any non-metallic substance known. The nacre from the shell of the abalone has become one of the more intensively studied biological structures in materials science. Clearly visible in these images are the neatly stacked (or ordered) mineral tiles separated by thin organic sheets along with a macrostructure of larger periodic growth bands which collectively form what scientists are currently referring to as a hierarchical composite structure. (The term hierarchy simply implies that there are a range of structural features which exist over a wide range of length scales).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.pmatsci.2007.05.002| title = Biological materials: Structure and mechanical properties| journal = Progress in Materials Science| volume = 53| pages = 1| year = 2008| last1 = Meyers | first1 = M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1514">A '''[[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] merger''' is "any [[merger]] that is not horizontal or vertical; in general, it is the combination of firms in different industries or firms operating in different geographic areas".  Conglomerate mergers can serve various purposes, including extending corporate territories and extending a product range.  One example of a conglomerate merger was the merger between the [[Walt Disney Company]] and the [[American Broadcasting Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics|author=Campbell R.

Because a conglomerate merger is one between two strategically unrelated firms, it is unlikely that the economic benefits will be generated for the target or the bidder. As such, conglomerate mergers seldom occur today. However, conglomerate mergers were popular in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s. Many conglomerate mergers are divested shortly after they are completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strategic Management and Competitive Advantages|author=Jay B. Barney and William S.

'''Culture theory''' is the branch of comparative [[anthropology]] and [[semiotics]] (not to be confused with [[cultural sociology]] or [[cultural studies]]) that seeks to define the [[heuristic]] concept of [[culture]] in [[operationalism|operational]] and/or [[scientific method|scientific]] terms.

==Overview==
In the 19th century, "[[culture]]" was used by some to refer to a wide array of [[human]] activities, and by some others as a synonym for "[[civilization]]".  In the 20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] began theorizing about culture as an object of scientific analysis.  Some used it to distinguish human [[Adaptation (biology)|adaptive strategies]] from the largely [[instinct]]ive adaptive strategies of [[animal]]s, including the adaptive strategies of other [[primate]]s and non-human [[Hominidae|hominid]]s, whereas others used it to refer to symbolic [[representation (arts)|representations]] and expressions of human experience, with no direct adaptive value.  Both groups understood culture as being definitive of [[human nature]].

According to many [[theory|theories]] that have gained wide acceptance among anthropologists, culture exhibits the way that humans interpret their [[biology]] and their [[social environment|environment]]. According to this point of view, culture becomes such an integral part of human [[existentialism|existence]] that it ''is'' the human environment, and most cultural [[Social change|change]] can be attributed to human adaptation to [[history|historical events]].  Moreover, given that culture is seen as the primary adaptive mechanism of humans and takes place much faster than [[human evolution|human biological evolution]], most cultural change can be viewed as culture adapting to itself.

Although most anthropologists try to define culture in such a way that it separates human beings from other animals, many human traits are similar to those of other animals, particularly the traits of other primates.  For example, [[chimpanzee]]s have big [[brain]]s, but human brains are bigger.  Similarly, [[bonobo]]s exhibit complex [[non-human animal sexuality|sexual behaviour]], but human beings exhibit much more complex [[human sexuality|sexual behaviours]].  As such, anthropologists often debate whether [[human behaviour]] is different from [[ethology|animal behaviour]] in degree rather than in kind; they must also find ways to distinguish cultural behaviour from sociological behaviour and [[psychological]] behavior.

Acceleration and amplification of these various aspects of culture change have been explored by complexity economist, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110123150543/http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/Papers/Papers.html W. Brian Arthur]. In his book, ''The Nature of Technology'', Arthur attempts to articulate a [[theory of change]] that considers that existing technologies (or material culture) are combined in unique ways that lead to novel new technologies. Behind that novel combination is a purposeful effort arising in human motivation. This articulation would suggest that we are just beginning to understand what might be required for a more robust theory of culture and culture change, one that brings coherence across many disciplines and reflects an integrating elegance.

[[File:Desmogblog.png|thumb|DeSmogBlog [[database]]]]
The '''DeSmogBlog''', founded in January 2006, is a [[blog]] that focuses on topics related to [[global warming]].  DeSmogBlog opposes what it describes as "a well-funded and highly organized public relations campaign" that it says is "poisoning" the [[global warming controversy|climate change debate]].&lt;ref name="Gorrie2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About Us" /&gt; The site was co-founded by James Hoggan, president of a public relations firm based in [[Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]].

==Content==

===Mission and audience===
The blog was co-founded in January 2006 by [[James (Jim) Hoggan|James Hoggan]], president of the [[public relations]] firm Hoggan and Associates.  In a February 2007 interview with the ''Vancouver Sun'', Hoggan conveys his anger at industry interests who he believes mislead the public about the scientific understanding of global warming. He referred to this alleged misrepresentation of the facts as, "public relations at its sleaziest".  Hoggan used his public relations skills to start a blog that would "clear the PR pollution that clouds the science of climate change" and expose organizations and individuals which he considered to be unethical. DeSmogBlog says it reports on the credibility of experts who appear to misrepresent the science of global warming in the media by investigating their scientific background, funding sources, and industry interests. The site originally targeted a Canadian audience but is now involved in global climate change coverage.&lt;ref name="Hoggan2005"/&gt;

Contributors to the site assist in researching organizations that the site's staff believe are phony, [[grassroots]] organizations, or [[astroturfing|astroturf]] groups sponsored directly or indirectly by industries seeking to thwart climate change-related legislation. Organizations alleged by the blog to be astroturfs include [[Friends of Science]], [[Natural Resources Stewardship Project]], [[Global Climate Coalition]], and [[International Climate Science Coalition]].&lt;ref name="Littlemore2008a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster"/&gt;  Individuals that the site has identified as pushing an anti-climate change point of view are listed in the site's "Denial Database", with accompanying information about their industry affiliations and professional biographies.&lt;ref name="Darah2007"/&gt;  In a ''[[Financial Post]]'' column, Canadian environmentalist [[Lawrence Solomon]] stated that the organization was, in Solomon's words, "specifically created for the purpose of discrediting skeptics."  &lt;ref name="Sol112709"&gt;{{cite news |title=Google's climate 'scholars'|author=Lawrence Solomon |url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fpcomment/archive/2009/11/27/google-s-climate-scholars.aspx |newspaper=[[Financial Post]] | format=Opinion column |publisher=Canada.com Network |location=Don Mills, Ontario |date=November 27, 2009 |accessdate=April 20, 2010 |quote=DeSmogBlog, an organization that Prall donates to, was specifically created for the purpose of discrediting skeptics.}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 report in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Hoggan stated that the most frequent visitors to the site came from [[Calgary]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Mittelstaedt"/&gt;

===Notable issues or media mentions===
In one instance, the site responded to a 2006 open letter opposing the Canadian Government's climate-change plans, claimed to be signed by "accredited experts in climate and related scientific disciplines", by analyzing the list of the signatories. The site concluded that those checked had few peer-reviewed publications on the topic and/or had [[fossil-fuel industry]] connections.&lt;ref name="Gorrie2007"/&gt;

DeSmogBlog has criticized ''[[Financial Post]]'' editor and columnist [[Terence Corcoran]], claiming he impedes progress on climate change and environmental protection legislation in Canada.&lt;ref name="LittlemoreDSB"/&gt;  In turn, Corcoran has criticized Hoggan and his website, accusing both of serving the interests of large corporations hoping to make money on [[emissions trading]].&lt;ref name="Corcoran"/&gt;

The blog has been referenced in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by [[George Monbiot]], who most recently cited a study by the website showing that in 2008 "the number of internet pages proposing that man-made global warming is a hoax or a lie more than doubled".&lt;ref name="Monbiot1"/&gt; In another column, Monbiot noted that DeSmogBlog posted a video critical of [[Anthony Watts (blogger)|Anthony Watts]]'s blog [[Watts Up With That]] that Watts had deleted from [[YouTube]] for copyright reasons.&lt;ref name="Monbiot2"/&gt; Monbiot has also mentioned DeSmogBlog's efforts to expose efforts by oil, coal, and electricity companies to manipulate media views on climate change.&lt;ref name="Monbiot3"/&gt;

===Heartland Institute documents===
In February 2012, DeSmogBlog posted a number of internal documents purportedly from [[The Heartland Institute]], a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] think tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desmogblog.com/heartland-institute-exposed-internal-documents-unmask-heart-climate-denial-machine |title=Heartland Institute Exposed Internal Documents Unmask Heart of Climate Denial Machine | publisher = DeSmogBlog |accessdate=2017-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a statement posted on the Heartland Institute website, "Some of these documents were stolen from Heartland, at least one is a fake, and some may have been altered&amp;nbsp;... the authenticity of those documents has not been confirmed."

Days after the document posting, blogger and journalist [[Megan McArdle]] wrote on ''[[The Atlantic]]'' website of a comment to a blog post that suggested that one of the documents, a memo titled "2012 Heartland Climate Strategy," was likely a fake based on the document being a scan which included metadata with a US west coast time zone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/02/leaked-docs-from-heartland-institute-cause-a-stir-but-is-one-a-fake/253165/ Leaked Docs From Heartland Institute Cause a Stir—but Is One a Fake?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/02/heartland-memo-looking-faker-by-the-minute/253276/ Heartland Memo Looking Faker By the Minute]&lt;/ref&gt; DeSmogBog responded that they had "no evidence supporting Heartland's claim that the Strategic document is fake" and then included a number of references to McArdle's first piece on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desmogblog.com/it-s-bird-it-s-hockey-stick-it-s-faked-document It's a bird; it's a hockey stick; it's a faked document!]&lt;/ref&gt;  McArdle then said of the DeSmogBlog response that "The first two links are to my post, and they are an egregious misrepresentation of what I said," and goes on to note that "the stubborn willingness to ignore obvious problems ''becomes the story''."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt;

On February 20, 2012, [[Peter Gleick]] issued a statement in the ''Huffington Post'' explaining that he had received an anonymous document in the mail that seemed to contain details on the climate program strategy of The Heartland Institute. He admitted to soliciting and receiving additional material from the Institute "under someone else's name," calling his actions "a serious lapse of my own and professional judgment and ethics."&lt;ref name="gleick"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-h-gleick/-the-origin-of-the-heartl_b_1289669.html The Origin of the Heartland Documents], [[Peter Gleick]], 2012-02-20, [[Huffington Post]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/02/21/breaking-news-heartland-leaker-is-scientist-peter-gleick-says-documents-are-all-real/ Breaking news: Heartland leaker is scientist Peter Gleick, says documents are all real]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder and staff==
The site's co-founder, James Hoggan, is President of the [[Vancouver]]-based public relations firm James Hoggan &amp; Associates, chair of the [[David Suzuki Foundation]], a trustee of the [[Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education]], and an executive member of the Urban Development Institute. He is the author (with Richard Littlemore) of the 2009 book ''Climate Cover-Up: The Crusade to Deny Global Warming'' ({{ISBN|978-1-55365-485-8}}), which criticizes [[climate change denial|global warming denial]] and [[global warming conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]].  The sources do not identify the site's other co-founder.&lt;ref name="whoweare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Darah2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marketwire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon1"/&gt;

The website names [[John Lefebvre]] as a benefactor. Frequent contributors to the blog include [[Ross Gelbspan]] and Richard Littlemore. Littlemore is a science writer who formerly worked for the ''[[Vancouver Sun]]''. The site's project manager was [[Kevin Grandia]], who left to become the Director of Online Strategy at Greenpeace . As of 2018 the site is now managed by Brendan DeMelle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.desmogblog.com/about|title=About|work=DeSmogBlog|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The site was recognized in December 2007 by three [[British Columbia]] chapters of the Canadian Public Relations Society, the Vancouver, Victoria (CPRS-vi) and ''Northern Lights'' in [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]], with an award for demonstrating "The highest ethical and professional standards while performing outstanding work". In a CPRS press release which accompanied the award, Hoggan stated that the site had been viewed by 520,000 people over its history, had been cited as a source by 24 media outlets, and mentioned in more than 4,500 other blogs. According to the press release, the blog was selected for the award by a panel of journalists and public relations professionals in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], Vancouver, and [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]].&lt;ref name="CPR_award"/&gt;

DeSmogBlog was also listed by [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine as one of the "best blogs of 2011" in June, 2011.&lt;ref name="Timesblogs"/&gt;

The '''dominance-based rough set approach''' ('''DRSA''') is an extension of [[rough set|rough set theory]] for [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA), introduced by Greco, Matarazzo and Słowiński.&lt;ref name="Greco_et_al_2001"&gt;

Słowiński, R., Greco, S., Matarazzo, B.: Rough set based decision support. Chapter 16 [in]: E.K. Burke and G. Kendall (eds.), Search Methodologies: Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques, Springer-Verlag , New York (2005) 475&amp;ndash;527&lt;/ref&gt; The main change compared to the classical [[rough sets]] is the substitution for the indiscernibility relation by a dominance relation, which permits one to deal with inconsistencies typical to consideration of '''criteria'''  and '''preference-ordered decision classes'''.

==Multicriteria classification (sorting)==
'''[[Multicriteria classification]]''' ([[Multicriteria sorting|sorting]]) is one of the problems considered within [[MCDA]] and can be stated as follows: given a set of objects evaluated by a set of [[criterion (MCDA)|criteria]] (attributes with preference-order domains), assign these objects to some pre-defined and preference-ordered decision classes, such that each object is assigned to exactly one class. Due to the preference ordering, improvement of evaluations of an object on the criteria should not worsen its class assignment. The sorting problem is very similar to the problem of [[Statistical classification|classification]], however, in the latter, the objects are evaluated by regular attributes and the decision classes are not necessarily preference ordered. The problem of multicriteria classification is also referred to as [[ordinal classification problem with monotonicity constraints]] and often appears in real-life application when [[Ordinal scale|ordinal]] and [[monotonic function|monotone]] properties follow from the domain knowledge about the problem.

As an illustrative example, consider the problem of evaluation in a high school. The director of the school wants to assign students (''objects'') to three classes: ''bad'', ''medium'' and ''good'' (notice that class ''good'' is preferred to ''medium'' and ''medium'' is preferred to ''bad''). Each student is described by three criteria: level in Physics, Mathematics and Literature, each taking one of three possible values ''bad'', ''medium'' and ''good''. Criteria are preference-ordered and improving the level from one of the subjects should not result in worse global evaluation (class).

As a more serious example, consider classification of bank clients, from the viewpoint of bankruptcy risk, into classes ''safe'' and ''risky''. This may involve such characteristics as "[[return on equity]] (ROE)", "[[return on investment]] (ROI)" and "[[return on sales]] (ROS)". The domains of these attributes are not simply ordered but involve a preference order since, from the viewpoint of bank managers, greater values of ROE, ROI or ROS are better for clients being analysed for bankruptcy risk . Thus, these attributes are criteria. Neglecting this information in [[knowledge discovery]] may lead to wrong conclusions.

==Data representation==

===Decision table===

In DRSA, data are often presented using a particular form of [[decision table]]. Formally, a DRSA decision table is a 4-tuple &lt;math&gt;S = \langle U, Q, V, f \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of objects, &lt;math&gt;Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of criteria, &lt;math&gt;V=\bigcup {}_{q \in Q} V_q&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V_q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the domain of the criterion &lt;math&gt;q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f \colon U \times Q \to V&lt;/math&gt; is an ''information function'' such that &lt;math&gt;f(x,q) \in V_q&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;(x,q) \in U \times Q&lt;/math&gt;. The set &lt;math&gt;Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is divided into ''condition criteria'' (set &lt;math&gt;C \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;) and the ''decision criterion'' (''class'') &lt;math&gt;d\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Notice, that &lt;math&gt;f(x,q)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is an evaluation of object &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on criterion &lt;math&gt;q \in C&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;f(x,d)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the class assignment (decision value) of the object. An example of decision table is shown in Table 1 below.

===Outranking relation===

It is assumed that the domain of a criterion &lt;math&gt;q \in Q&lt;/math&gt; is completely [[preorder]]ed by an '''[[outranking relation]]''' &lt;math&gt;\succeq_q&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;x \succeq_q y&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is at least as good as (outranks) &lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the criterion &lt;math&gt;q\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, we assume that the domain of &lt;math&gt;q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of [[real number|reals]], &lt;math&gt;V_q \subseteq \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and that the outranking relation is a simple order between real numbers &lt;math&gt;\geq\,\!&lt;/math&gt; such that the following relation holds: &lt;math&gt;x \succeq_q y \iff f(x,q) \geq f(y,q)&lt;/math&gt;. This relation is straightforward for gain-type ("the more, the better") criterion, e.g. ''company profit''. For cost-type ("the less, the better") criterion, e.g. ''product price'', this relation can be satisfied by negating the values from &lt;math&gt;V_q\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

===Decision classes and class unions===

Let &lt;math&gt;T = \{1,\ldots,n\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The domain of decision criterion, &lt;math&gt;V_d\,\!&lt;/math&gt; consist of &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; elements (without loss of generality we assume &lt;math&gt;V_d = T\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) and induces a partition of &lt;math&gt;U\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; classes &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Cl}=\{Cl_t, t \in T\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Cl_t = \{x \in U \colon f(x,d) = t\}&lt;/math&gt;. Each object &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; is assigned to one and only one class &lt;math&gt;Cl_t, t \in T&lt;/math&gt;. The classes are preference-ordered according to an increasing order of class indices, i.e. for all &lt;math&gt;r,s \in T&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r \geq s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the objects from &lt;math&gt;Cl_r\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are strictly preferred to the objects from &lt;math&gt;Cl_s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. For this reason, we can consider the '''upward and downward unions of classes''', defined respectively, as:

:&lt;math&gt;
Cl^{\geq}_t = \bigcup_{s \geq t} Cl_s \qquad Cl^{\leq}_t= \bigcup_{s \leq t} Cl_s \qquad t \in T
&lt;/math&gt;

==Main concepts==

===Dominance===

We say that &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; '''dominates''' &lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt; x D_p y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is better than &lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on every criterion from &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \succeq_q y, \, \forall q \in P&lt;/math&gt;.  For each &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, the dominance relation &lt;math&gt;D_P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[Transitive relation|transitive]], i.e. it is a [[preorder|partial pre-order]]. Given &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;, let

:&lt;math&gt;
D_P^+(x) = \{y \in U \colon y D_p x \}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
D_P^-(x) = \{y \in U \colon x D_p y \}
&lt;/math&gt;

represent '''''P''-dominating''' set and '''''P''-dominated''' set with respect to &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

===Rough approximations===

The key idea of the [[rough set]] philosophy is approximation of one knowledge by another knowledge. In DRSA, the knowledge being approximated is a collection of upward and downward unions of decision classes and the "granules of knowledge" used for approximation are ''P''-dominating and ''P''-dominated sets.

The '''''P''-lower''' and the '''''P''-upper approximation''' of &lt;math&gt;Cl_t^{\geq}, t \in T&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq})&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq}) = \{x \in U \colon D_P^+(x) \subseteq Cl_t^{\geq} \}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq}) = \{x \in U \colon D_P^-(x) \cap Cl_t^{\geq} \neq \emptyset\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Analogously, the ''P''-lower and the ''P''-upper approximation of &lt;math&gt;Cl_t^{\leq}, t \in T&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq})&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq}) = \{x \in U \colon D_P^-(x) \subseteq Cl_t^{\leq} \}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq}) = \{x \in U \colon D_P^+(x) \cap Cl_t^{\leq} \neq \emptyset\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Lower approximations group the objects which ''certainly'' belong to class union &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\ge}_t&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\le}_t&lt;/math&gt;). This certainty comes from the fact, that object &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the lower approximation &lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl^{\ge}_t)&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl^{\le}_t)&lt;/math&gt;), if no other object in &lt;math&gt;U\,\!&lt;/math&gt; contradicts this claim, i.e. every object &lt;math&gt;y \in U&lt;/math&gt; which ''P''-dominates &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, also belong to the class union &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\ge}_t&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\le}_t&lt;/math&gt;). Upper approximations group the objects which ''could belong'' to &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\ge}_t&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\le}_t&lt;/math&gt;), since object &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the upper approximation &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl^{\ge}_t)&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl^{\le}_t)&lt;/math&gt;), if there exist another object &lt;math&gt;y \in U&lt;/math&gt; ''P''-dominated by &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; from class union &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\ge}_t&lt;/math&gt; (respectively &lt;math&gt;Cl^{\le}_t&lt;/math&gt;).

The ''P''-lower and ''P''-upper approximations defined as above satisfy the following properties for all &lt;math&gt;t \in T&lt;/math&gt; and for any &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq}) \subseteq Cl_t^{\geq} \subseteq \overline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq})
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq}) \subseteq Cl_t^{\leq} \subseteq \overline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq})
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''''P''-boundaries''' (''P-doubtful regions'') of &lt;math&gt;Cl_t^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Cl_t^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt; are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
Bn_P(Cl_t^{\geq}) = \overline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq})-\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\geq})
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
Bn_P(Cl_t^{\leq}) = \overline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq})-\underline{P}(Cl_t^{\leq})
&lt;/math&gt;

===Quality of approximation and reducts===

The ratio

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_P(\textbf{Cl}) = \frac{\left|U - \left( \left( \bigcup_{t \in T} Bn_P(Cl_t^{\geq}) \right) \cup \left( \bigcup_{t \in T} Bn_P(Cl_t^{\leq}) \right) \right)\right|}{|U|}
&lt;/math&gt;

defines the '''quality of approximation''' of the partition &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Cl}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into classes by means of the set of criteria &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. This ratio express the relation between all the ''P''-correctly classified objects and all the objects in the table.

Every minimal subset &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma_P(\mathbf{Cl}) = \gamma_C(\mathbf{Cl})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''[[reduct]]''' of &lt;math&gt;C\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;RED_{\mathbf{Cl}}(P)&lt;/math&gt;. A decision table may have more than one reduct. The intersection of all reducts is known as the ''core''.

==Decision rules==

On the basis of the approximations obtained by means of the dominance relations, it is possible to induce a generalized description of the preferential information contained in the decision table, in terms of '''[[decision rules]]'''. The decision rules are expressions of the form ''if'' [condition] ''then'' [consequent], that represent a form of dependency between condition criteria and decision criteria. Procedures for generating decision rules from a decision table use an inducive learning principle. We can distinguish three types of rules: certain, possible and approximate. Certain rules are generated from lower approximations of unions of classes; possible rules are generated from upper approximations of unions of classes and approximate rules are generated from boundary regions.

Certain rules has the following form:

:
if &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_1) \geq r_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_2) \geq r_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ldots f(x,q_p) \geq r_p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x \in Cl_t^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt;

:
if &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_1) \leq r_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_2) \leq r_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ldots f(x,q_p) \leq r_p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x \in Cl_t^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt;

Possible rules has a similar syntax, however the ''consequent'' part of the rule has the form: &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''could belong to'' &lt;math&gt;Cl_t^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; or the form: &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''could belong to'' &lt;math&gt;Cl_t^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, approximate rules has the syntax:

:
if &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_1) \geq r_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_2) \geq r_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ldots f(x,q_k) \geq r_k\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_{k+1}) \leq r_{k+1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x,q_{k+2}) \leq r_{k+2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ldots f(x,q_p) \leq r_p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;x \in Cl_s \cup Cl_{s+1} \cup Cl_t&lt;/math&gt;

The certain, possible and approximate rules represent certain, possible and ambiguous knowledge extracted from the decision table.

Each decision rule should be minimal. Since a decision rule is an implication, by a minimal decision rule we understand such an implication that there is no other implication with an antecedent of at least the same weakness (in other words, rule using a subset of elementary conditions or/and weaker elementary conditions) and a consequent of at least the same strength (in other words, rule assigning objects to the same union or sub-union of classes).

A set of decision rules is ''complete'' if it is able to cover all objects from the decision table in such a way that consistent objects are re-classified to their original classes and inconsistent objects are classified to clusters of classes referring to this inconsistency. We call ''minimal'' each set of decision rules that is complete and non-redundant, i.e. exclusion of any rule from this set makes it non-complete.
One of three induction strategies can be adopted to obtain a set of decision rules:&lt;ref&gt;Stefanowski, J.: On rough set based approach to induction of decision rules. In Skowron, A., Polkowski, L. (eds.): Rough Set in Knowledge Discovering, Physica Verlag, Heidelberg (1998) 500--529&lt;/ref&gt;

* generation of a minimal description, i.e. a minimal set of rules,

==Example==

Consider the following problem of high school students’ evaluations:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" border="1"
|+ Table 1: Example—High School Evaluations
! ''object'' (student) !! &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Mathematics)&lt;/small&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Physics)&lt;/small&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;q_3&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Literature)&lt;/small&gt; !! !! &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(global score)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;
|medium || medium || bad || || bad
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; 
|good || medium || bad || || medium
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt; 
|medium || good || bad || || medium
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_4&lt;/math&gt; 
|bad || medium || good || || bad
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_5&lt;/math&gt; 
|bad || bad || medium || || bad
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_6&lt;/math&gt; 
|bad || medium || medium || || medium
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_7&lt;/math&gt; 
|good || good || bad || || good
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_8&lt;/math&gt; 
|good || medium || medium || || medium
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_9&lt;/math&gt; 
|medium || medium || good || || good
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x_{10}&lt;/math&gt; 
|good || medium || good || || good
|}

Each object (student) is described by three criteria &lt;math&gt;q_1,q_2,q_3\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, related to the levels in Mathematics, Physics and Literature, respectively. According to the decision attribute, the students are divided into three preference-ordered classes: &lt;math&gt;Cl_1 = \{bad\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Cl_2 = \{medium\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Cl_3 = \{good\}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the following unions of classes were approximated:

* &lt;math&gt;Cl_1^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the class of (at most) bad students,
* &lt;math&gt;Cl_2^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the class of at most medium students,
* &lt;math&gt;Cl_2^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the class of at least medium students,
* &lt;math&gt;Cl_3^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the class of (at least) good students.

Notice that evaluations of objects &lt;math&gt;x_4\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_6\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are inconsistent, because &lt;math&gt;x_4\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has better evaluations on all three criteria than &lt;math&gt;x_6\,\!&lt;/math&gt; but worse global score.

Therefore, lower approximations of class unions consist of the following objects:

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl_1^{\leq}) = \{x_1,x_5\}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl_2^{\leq}) = \{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6,x_8\} = Cl_2^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl_2^{\geq}) = \{x_2,x_3,x_7,x_8,x_9,x_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(Cl_3^{\geq}) = \{x_7,x_9,x_{10}\} = Cl_3^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, only classes &lt;math&gt;Cl_1^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Cl_2^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be approximated precisely. Their upper approximations are as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl_1^{\leq}) = \{x_1,x_4,x_5,x_6\}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl_2^{\geq}) = \{x_2,x_3,x_4,x_6,x_7,x_8,x_9,x_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;

while their boundary regions are:

:&lt;math&gt;Bn_P(Cl_1^{\leq}) = Bn_P(Cl_2^{\geq}) = \{x_4,x_6\}&lt;/math&gt;

Of course, since &lt;math&gt;Cl_2^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Cl_3^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; are approximated precisely, we have &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl_2^{\leq})=Cl_2^{\leq}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{P}(Cl_3^{\geq})=Cl_3^{\geq}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Bn_P(Cl_2^{\leq}) = Bn_P(Cl_3^{\geq}) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;

The following minimal set of 10 rules can be induced from the decision table:

# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Physics \leq bad&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \leq bad&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Literature \leq bad&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Physics \leq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Math \leq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \leq bad&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Math \leq bad&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \leq medium&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Literature \leq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Physics \leq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \leq medium&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Math \leq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Literature \leq bad&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \leq medium&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Literature \geq good&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Math \geq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \geq good&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Physics \geq good&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Math \geq good&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \geq good&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Math \geq good&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \geq medium&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Physics \geq good&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student \geq medium&lt;/math&gt;
# ''if'' &lt;math&gt;Math \leq bad&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;Physics \geq medium&lt;/math&gt; ''then'' &lt;math&gt;student = bad \lor medium&lt;/math&gt;

The last rule is approximate, while the rest are certain.

==Extensions==

===Multicriteria choice and ranking problems===

The other two problems considered within [[multi-criteria decision analysis]], [[multicriteria choice]] and [[ranking]] problems, can also be solved using dominance-based rough set approach. This is done by converting the decision table into [[pairwise comparison table]] (PCT).&lt;ref name="Greco_et_al_2001"/&gt;

===Variable-consistency DRSA===

The definitions of rough approximations are based on a strict application of the dominance principle. However, when defining non-ambiguous objects, it is reasonable to accept a limited proportion of negative examples, particularly for large decision tables. Such extended version of DRSA is called '''[[Variable-Consistency DRSA]] model (VC-DRSA)'''&lt;ref&gt;Greco, S., B. Matarazzo, R. Slowinski and J. Stefanowski: Variable consistency model of dominance-based rough set approach. In W.Ziarko, Y.Yao (eds.): Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing. Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence '''2005''' (2001) 170&amp;ndash;181. Springer-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stochastic DRSA===

In real-life data, particularly for large datasets, the notions of rough approximations were found to be excessively restrictive. Therefore, an extension of DRSA, based on stochastic model ('''[[stochastic dominance-based rough sets|Stochastic DRSA]]'''), which allows inconsistencies to some degree, has been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Dembczyński, K., Greco, S., Kotłowski, W., Słowiński, R.: Statistical model for rough set approach to multicriteria classification. In Kok, J.N., Koronacki, J., de Mantaras, R.L., Matwin, S.,
  Mladenic, D., Skowron, A. (eds.): Knowledge Discovery in Databases: PKDD 2007, Warsaw, Poland. Lecture Notes in Computer Science '''4702''' (2007) 164&amp;ndash;175.&lt;/ref&gt; Having stated the probabilistic model for ordinal classification problems with monotonicity constraints, the concepts of lower approximations are extended to the
stochastic case. The method is based on estimating the conditional probabilities using the nonparametric [[maximum likelihood]] method which leads
to the problem of [[isotonic regression]].

Stochastic dominance-based rough sets can also be regarded as a sort of variable-consistency model.

In [[physics]], the '''dynamo theory''' proposes a mechanism by which a celestial body such as [[Earth]] or a [[star]] generates a [[magnetic field]]. The dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating, [[convection|convecting]], and [[electric]]ally conducting fluid can maintain a magnetic field over [[astronomical]] time scales.  A dynamo is thought to be the source of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] and the magnetic fields of other planets.

==History of theory==
When [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] published ''[[de Magnete]]'' in 1600, he concluded that the Earth is magnetic and proposed the first hypothesis for the origin of this magnetism: permanent magnetism such as that found in [[lodestone]]. In 1919, [[Joseph Larmor]] proposed that a [[dynamo]] might be generating the field.&lt;ref name=Larmor1919&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Larmor |year=1919 |title=How could a rotating body such as the Sun become a magnet? |journal=Reports of the British Association |volume=87  |pages= 159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Larmor |year=1919 |title=Possible rotational origin of magnetic fields of sun and earth |journal=Electrical Review |volume=85  |pages= 412ff }}  Reprinted in ''Engineering'', vol. 108, pages 461ff (3 October 1919).&lt;/ref&gt; However, even after he advanced his hypothesis, some prominent scientists advanced alternative explanations. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] believed that there might be an asymmetry between the charges of the [[electron]] and [[proton]] so that the [[Earth's magnetic field]] would be produced by the entire Earth. The [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Patrick Blackett]] did a series of experiments looking for a fundamental relation between [[angular momentum]] and [[magnetic moment]], but found none.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nye|first=Mary Jo|title=Temptations of theory, strategies of evidence: P. M. S. Blackett and the earth's magnetism, 1947–52|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|date=1 March 1999|volume=32|issue=1|pages=69–92|doi=10.1017/S0007087498003495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996|loc=page 17}} claim that in 1905, shortly after composing his [[special relativity]] paper, [[Albert Einstein]] described the origin of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] as being one of the great unsolved problems facing modern [[physicist]]s. However, they do not provide details on where he made this statement.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter M. Elsasser]], considered a "father" of the presently accepted dynamo theory as an explanation of the Earth's magnetism, proposed that this magnetic field resulted from electric currents induced in the fluid outer core of the Earth. He revealed the history of the Earth's magnetic field through pioneering the study of the magnetic orientation of minerals in rocks.

In order to maintain the magnetic field against [[ohm]]ic decay (which would occur for the dipole field in 20,000 years), the outer core must be convecting.  The [[convection]] is likely some combination of thermal and compositional convection.  The mantle controls the rate at which heat is extracted from the core.  Heat sources include gravitational energy released by the compression of the core, gravitational energy released by the rejection of light elements (probably [[sulfur]], [[oxygen]], or [[silicon]]) at the inner core boundary as it grows, latent heat of crystallization at the inner core boundary, and radioactivity of [[potassium]], [[uranium]] and [[thorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Sanders | title=Radioactive potassium may be major heat source in Earth's core | publisher=UC Berkeley News | date=2003-12-10 | url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/12/10_heat.shtml | accessdate=2007-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the dawn of the 21st century, numerical modeling of the Earth's magnetic field has not been successfully demonstrated, but appears to be in reach. Initial models are focused on field generation by convection in the planet's fluid outer core. It was possible to show the generation of a strong, Earth-like field when the model assumed a uniform core-surface temperature and exceptionally high viscosities for the core fluid. Computations which incorporated more realistic parameter values yielded magnetic fields that were less Earth-like, but also point the way to model refinements which may ultimately lead to an accurate analytic model.  Slight variations in the core-surface temperature, in the range of a few millikelvins, result in significant increases in convective flow and produce more realistic magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sakuraba | first = Ataru |author2=Paul H.

==Formal definition==
Dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating, convecting, and electrically conducting fluid acts to maintain a magnetic field.  This theory is used to explain the presence of anomalously long-lived magnetic fields in astrophysical bodies. The conductive fluid in the geodynamo is liquid iron in the outer core, and in the [[solar dynamo]] is ionized gas at the [[tachocline]]. Dynamo theory of astrophysical bodies uses [[Magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] equations to investigate how the fluid can continuously regenerate the magnetic field.&lt;ref name="hydromagnetic dynamo"&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hydromagnetic_dynamo_theory | title=Hydromagnetic dynamo theory | publisher=Scholarpedia | date=2007 | accessdate=October 7, 2016 | author=Brandenburg, Axel}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It was once believed that the [[dipole]], which comprises much of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] and is misaligned along the rotation axis by 11.3 degrees, was caused by permanent magnetization of the materials in the earth. This means that dynamo theory was originally used to explain the Sun's magnetic field in its relationship with that of the Earth. However, this hypothesis, which was initially proposed by [[Joseph Larmor]] in 1919, has been modified due to extensive studies of magnetic [[secular variation]], [[paleomagnetism]] (including [[geomagnetic reversal|polarity reversal]]s), seismology, and the solar system's abundance of elements. Also, the application of the theories of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] to magnetic observations showed that Earth's magnetic field had an internal, rather than external, origin.

There are three requisites for a dynamo to operate:

*An electrically conductive fluid medium
*Kinetic energy provided by planetary rotation
*An internal energy source to drive convective motions within the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=E. Pallé |title=The Earth as a Distant Planet: A Rosetta Stone for the Search of Earth-Like Worlds (Astronomy and Astrophysics Library) |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2010 |pages=316–317 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLuVCJtRTV0C&amp;pg=PA316 |isbn=978-1-4419-1683-9 |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the Earth, the magnetic field is induced and constantly maintained by the convection of liquid iron in the outer core.  A requirement for the induction of field is a rotating fluid.  Rotation in the outer core is supplied by the [[Coriolis effect]] caused by the rotation of the Earth.  The Coriolis force tends to organize fluid motions and electric currents into columns (also see [[Taylor column]]s) aligned with the rotation axis.  Induction or creation of magnetic field is described by the [[induction equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{B} + \nabla \times (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{B}) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' is velocity, '''B''' is magnetic field, ''t'' is time, and &lt;math&gt;\eta=1/(\sigma\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic diffusivity]] with &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; electrical conductivity and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]].  The ratio of the second term on the right hand side to the first term gives the [[Magnetic Reynolds number]], a dimensionless ratio of advection of magnetic field to diffusion.

===Tidal heating supporting a dynamo===
Tidal forces between celestial orbiting bodies cause friction that heats up their interiors. This is known as tidal heating, and it helps keep the interior in a liquid state. A liquid interior that can conduct electricity is required to produce a dynamo. Saturn's Enceladus and Jupiter's Io have enough tidal heating to liquify their inner cores, but they may not create a dynamo because they cannot conduct electricity.&lt;ref name="Enceladus"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury, despite its small size, has a magnetic field, because it has a conductive liquid core created by its iron composition and friction resulting from its highly elliptical orbit.&lt;ref name="mercury core"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://carnegiescience.edu/news/mercury%E2%80%99s_surprising_core_and_landscape_curiosities | title=Mercury's Surprising Core and Landscape Curiosities | publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science | website=MESSENGER | date=March 21, 2012 | accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorized that the Moon once had a magnetic field, based on evidence from magnetized lunar rocks, due to its short-lived closer distance to Earth creating tidal heating.&lt;ref name="lunar dynamo"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; An orbit and rotation of a planet helps provide a liquid core, and supplements kinetic energy that supports a dynamo action.

==Kinematic dynamo theory==
In kinematic dynamo theory the velocity field is prescribed, instead of being a dynamic variable.  This method cannot provide the time variable behavior of a fully nonlinear chaotic dynamo but is useful in studying how magnetic field strength varies with the flow structure and speed.

Using [[Maxwell's equations]] simultaneously with the curl of [[Ohm's law]], one can derive what is basically the linear eigenvalue equation for magnetic fields ('''B''') which can be done when assuming that the magnetic field is independent from the velocity field. One arrives at a critical ''[[magnetic Reynolds number]]'' above which the flow strength is sufficient to amplify the imposed magnetic field, and below which it decays.

The most functional feature of kinematic dynamo theory is that it can be used to test whether a velocity field is or is not capable of dynamo action. By applying a certain velocity field to a small magnetic field, it can be determined through observation whether the magnetic field tends to grow or not in reaction to the applied flow. If the magnetic field does grow, then the system is either capable of dynamo action or is a dynamo, but if the magnetic field does not grow, then it is simply referred to as non-dynamo.

The [[membrane paradigm]] is a way of looking at [[black hole]]s that allows for the material near their surfaces to be expressed in the language of dynamo theory.

=== As a spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry ===
Kinematic dynamo can be also viewed as the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of the topological supersymmetry of the associated stochastic differential equation related to the flow of the background matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ovchinnikov, I.V. |author2=Ensslin, T. A. |title=Kinematic dynamo, supersymmetry breaking, and chaos |journal=Physical Review D |volume=93 |issue=8 |pages=085023 |date=April 2016 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.93.085023|arxiv=1512.01651 |bibcode=2016PhRvD..93h5023O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics|supersymmetric theory of stochastics]], this supersymmetry is an intrinsic property of all stochastic differential equations, its meaning is the preservation of the continuity of the phase space of the model by continuous time flows, and its spontaneous breakdown is the stochastic generalization of the concept of [[Chaos theory|deterministic chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 2016|title=Introduction to Supersymmetric Theory of Stochastics|journal=Entropy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=108|doi=10.3390/e18040108|author=Ovchinnikov, I.V.|arxiv=1511.03393|bibcode=2016Entrp..18..108O}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, kinematic dynamo is a manifestation of the chaoticity of the underlying flow of the background matter.

==Nonlinear dynamo theory==
The kinematic approximation becomes invalid when the magnetic field becomes strong enough to affect the fluid motions. In that case the velocity field becomes affected by the [[Lorentz force]], and so the induction equation is no longer linear in the magnetic field. In most cases this leads to a quenching of the amplitude of the dynamo. Such dynamos are sometimes also referred to as ''hydromagnetic dynamos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Eugene N.|title=Hydromagnetic Dynamo Models|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=September 1955|volume=122|pages=293&amp;ndash;314|doi=10.1086/146087|bibcode = 1955ApJ...122..293P }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Virtually all dynamos in astrophysics and geophysics are hydromagnetic dynamos.

The main idea of the theory is that any small magnetic field existing in the outer core, creates currents in the moving fluid there due to Lorenz force. These currents create further magnetic field due to [[Ampere's law]]. With the fluid motion, the currents are carried in a way that the magnetic field gets stronger (as long as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}\cdot(\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt; is negative&lt;ref name=Kono2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kono|first=Masaru|first2=Paul H. |last2=Roberts|title=Recent geodynamo simulations and observations of the geomagnetic field|journal=[[Reviews of Geophysics]]|year=2002|volume=40|issue=4|pages=1–53|doi=10.1029/2000RG000102|bibcode = 2002RvGeo..40.1013K|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus a "seed" magnetic field can get stronger and stronger until it reaches some value that is related to existing non-magnetic forces.

Numerical models are used to simulate fully nonlinear dynamos.  The following equations are used:

*The induction equation, presented above.
*Maxwell's equations for negligible electric field:

::&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B}=0&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;

*The [[continuity equation]] for [[conservation of mass]], for which the [[Boussinesq approximation (buoyancy)|Boussinesq approximation]] is often used:

::&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

*The [[Navier–Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equation]] for conservation of [[momentum]], again in the same approximation, with the magnetic force and gravitation force as the external forces:

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{D\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho_0}\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \rho'\mathbf{g} + 2\mathbf{\Omega} \times \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{\Omega} \times \mathbf{\Omega} \times \mathbf{R} + \frac{1}{\rho_0}\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}, &lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the kinematic [[viscosity]], &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt;is the mean density and &lt;math&gt;\rho'&lt;/math&gt; is the relative density perturbation that provides buoyancy (for thermal convection &lt;math&gt;\rho'=\alpha\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]), &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Earth's rotation|rotation rate of the Earth]], and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric current density.

*A transport equation, usually of heat (sometimes of light element concentration):

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \kappa \nabla^2 T +\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;

:where ''T'' is temperature, &lt;math&gt;\kappa=k/\rho c_p&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal diffusivity with ''k'' thermal conductivity, &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; heat capacity, and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; density, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an optional heat source.  Often the pressure is the dynamic pressure, with the hydrostatic pressure and centripetal potential removed.

These equations are then non-dimensionalized, introducing the non-dimensional parameters,

:&lt;math&gt;Ra=\frac{g\alpha T D^3}{\nu \kappa} , E=\frac{\nu}{\Omega D^2} , Pr=\frac{\nu}{\kappa} , Pm=\frac{\nu}{\eta} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''Ra'' is the [[Rayleigh number]], ''E'' the [[Ekman number]], ''Pr'' and ''Pm'' the [[Prandtl number|Prandtl]] and [[magnetic Prandtl number]].  Magnetic field scaling is often in [[Elsasser number]] units &lt;math&gt;B=(\rho \Omega/\sigma)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Energy conversion between magnetic and kinematic energy===
The scalar product of the above form of Navier-Stokes equation with &lt;math&gt;\rho_0\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; gives the rate of increase of kinetic energy density, &lt;math&gt;(1/2)\rho_0 u^2&lt;/math&gt;, on the left-hand side. The last term on the right-hand side is then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}\cdot(\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;, the local contribution to the kinetic energy due to [[Lorentz force#Continuous charge distribution|Lorentz force]].

The scalar product of the induction equation with &lt;math&gt;(1/\mu_0)\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; gives the rate of increase of the magnetic energy density, &lt;math&gt;(1/2\mu_0)B^2&lt;/math&gt;, on the left-hand side. The last term on the right-hand side is then &lt;math&gt;(1/\mu_0)\mathbf{B}\cdot\left(\nabla \times (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{B})\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the equation is volume-integrated, this term is [[integration by parts|equivalent up to a boundary term]] (and with the double use of the [[Triple product#Scalar triple product|scalar triple product]] identity) to &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{u}\cdot\left((1/\mu_0)(\nabla\times\mathbf{B})\times\mathbf{B})\right) = -\mathbf{u}\cdot(\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt; (where one of Maxwell's equations was used). This is the local contribution to the magnetic energy due to fluid motion.

Thus the term &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{u}\cdot(\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of transformation of kinetic energy to magnetic energy. This has to be non-negative at least in part of the volume, for the dynamo to produce magnetic field.&lt;ref name=Kono2002/&gt;

===Order of magnitude of the magnetic field created by Earth's dynamo===
The above formula for the rate of conversion of kinetic energy to magnetic energy, is equivalent to a rate of work done by a force of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; on the outer core matter, whose velocity is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;. This work is the result of non-magnetic forces acting on the fluid.

Of those, the gravitational force and the [[centrifugal force]] are [[conservative vector field|conservative]] and therefore have no overall contribution to fluid moving in closed loops. Ekman number (defined above), which is the ratio between the two remaining forces, namely the viscosity and Coriolis force, is very low inside Earth's outer core, because its viscosity is low (1.2-1.5 x10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; [[pascal-second]] &lt;ref name="Wijs1998"/&gt;) due to its liquidity.

Thus the main time-averaged contribution to the work is from Coriolis force, whose size is &lt;math&gt;-2\rho\,\mathbf{\Omega} \times \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;, though this quantity and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are related only indirectly and are not in general equal locally (thus they affect each other but not in the same place and time).

The current density ''J'' is itself the result of the magnetic field according to [[Ohm's law#Magnetic effects|Ohm's law]]. Again, due to matter motion and current flow, this is not necessarily the field at the same place and time. However these relations can still be used to deduce orders of magnitude of the quantities in question.

In terms of order of magnitude, &lt;math&gt;J\,B \sim \rho\, \Omega\,u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J \sim \sigma u B&lt;/math&gt;, giving &lt;math&gt;\sigma\,u\, B^2 \sim \rho\, \Omega\,u&lt;/math&gt;, or:
:&lt;math&gt;B \sim \sqrt{\frac{\rho\,\Omega} {\sigma}}&lt;/math&gt;

The exact ratio between both sides is the square root of [[Elsasser number]].

Note that the magnetic field direction cannot be inferred from this approximation (at least not its sign) as it appears squared, and is, indeed, sometimes [[Earth's magnetic field#Magnetic field reversals|reversed]], though in general it lies on a similar axis to that of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;.

For earth outer core, ''&amp;rho;'' is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name = "Wijs1998"&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8072/57a2b0ecc863b2f7ae143b9f54ae4b6d10cd.pdf de Wijs, G. A., Kresse, G., Vočadlo, L., Dobson, D., Alfe, D., Gillan, M. J., &amp; Price, G. D. (1998). The viscosity of liquid iron at the physical conditions of the Earth's core. Nature, 392(6678), 805.‏]&lt;/ref&gt; ''&amp;Omega;''=2&amp;pi;/day = 7.3x10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and ''&amp;sigma;'' is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Ohta, K., Kuwayama, Y., Hirose, K., Shimizu, K., &amp; Ohishi, Y. (2016). Experimental determination of the electrical resistivity of iron at Earth’s core conditions. Nature, 534(7605), 95.‏ [http://www.spring8.or.jp/pdf/en/res_fro/16/094_095.pdf Link to a summary]&lt;/ref&gt;
This gives 2.7x10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; [[Tesla (unit)|Tesla]].

The magnetic field of a [[magnetic dipole]] has an inverse cubic dependence in distance, so its order of magnitude at the earth surface can be approximated by multiplying the above result with (''R''&lt;sub&gt;outer core&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = (2890/6370)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.093, giving 2.5x10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; Tesla, not far from to the measured value of 3x10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; Tesla at the [[equator]].

==Numerical models==
The equations for the geodynamo are enormously difficult to solve, and the realism of the solutions is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to  ''kinematic dynamo'' models described above, in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and the effect on the magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and seeing whether they could sustain a dynamo.&lt;ref name="Kono2002"/&gt;

The first ''self-consistent'' dynamo models, ones that determine both the fluid motions and the magnetic field, were developed by two groups in 1995, one in Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kageyama|first=Akira|last2=Sato |first2=Tetsuya|title=Computer simulation of a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo.

The '''Economic Cooperation Administration''' ('''ECA''') was a U.S. government agency set up in 1948 to administer the [[Marshall Plan]]. It reported to both the [[United States State Department|State Department]] and the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]]. The agency's first head was [[Paul G. Hoffman]], a former leader of car manufacturer [[Studebaker]]; he was succeeded by [[William Chapman Foster]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Administrators of the Economic Cooperation Administration|url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/principalofficers/administrator-economic-cooperation-administration|website=U.S. State Department, Office of the Historian|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the organization was also headed by major business figures such as [[Arthur A. Kimball]] (who was a key contributor to the ECA's founding) as well as [[David K.E. Bruce]] (who worked at the [[Office of Strategic Services]] in Europe during [[World War II]]).

The ECA had an office in the capital of each of the 16 countries participating in the Marshall Plan. In theory the ECA served as joint administrator of the Marshall Plan development projects in each European country. In practice, local officials knew far more about what was needed than ECA representatives, who developed a management strategy of listening to local officials and allowed them to set priorities for reconstruction assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Jacob J. 1999.

Arlington, VA: Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training, Foreign Affairs Oral History Project, Foreign Assistance Series, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was succeeded by the [[Mutual Security Agency]] in 1951, one of the predecessor to the [[United States Agency for International Development]].

'''Eldridge Moores''' (October 13, 1938 – October 28, 2018) was an [[United States|American]] [[geologist]].&lt;ref name="UCD"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://geology.ucdavis.edu/people/inmemoriam/moores |title=Eldridge M. Moores (1938-2018) |website=UC Davis Earth and Planetary Sciences |language=en |access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He specialized in the understanding of [[ophiolites]] (fragments of [[oceanic crust]] and mantle that have been emplaced onto the [[continental crust]]) and the geology of the continental crust of the Western [[United States]] and Tethyan belt, the geology of [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Pakistan]], and the tectonic development of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and the Alpine - Himalayan systems.&lt;ref name="UCD" /&gt;

Moores was Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Geology at the [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref name="UCD" /&gt;

In 1996, Moores was President of the [[Geological Society of America]] (GSA)&lt;ref&gt;GSA Past Leaders http://www.geosociety.org/GSA/About/Leadership/Past_Leaders/GSA/About/Past_Leaders.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and editor of the society's journal [[Geology (journal)|''Geology'']] from 1981 to 1989. He is the recipient of the GSA's Distinguished Service Award and the Geological Association of Canada Medal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geosociety.org/awards/06speeches/international.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with geologist [[Robert J. Twiss]], Moores co-authored two textbooks: ''Tectonics''&lt;ref&gt;''Tectonics'', W. H. Freeman (1995); {{ISBN|9780716724377}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Structural Geology''&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Geology'', Macmillan Higher Education (2006); {{ISBN|9780716749516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moores is the main subject of the [[John McPhee]] book on California geology, ''Assembling California'' (1993),&lt;ref&gt;''Assembling California'' (1998); Farrar, Straus and Giroux /  [http://us.macmillan.com/assemblingcalifornia/johnmcphee Macmillan] (1993); {{ISBN|9780374523930}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as McPhee's ''[[Annals of the Former World]]'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of the Former World'', John McPhee; Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux, New York, NY (1998); {{ISBN|9780374105204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Eldridge Moores was awarded the title of UC Davis distinguished professor emeritus. This title is awarded annually by the UC Davis Emeriti Association on the basis of outstanding contributions following retirement in the traditional areas of teaching, research and service.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/ucd/eldridge-moores-name-distinguished-professor-emeritus/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4076">'''Expanded bed adsorption''' (EBA) is a preparative chromatographic technique which makes processing of viscous and particulate liquids possible.

==Principle==
The [[protein]] binding principles in EBA are the same as in classical [[column chromatography]] and the common [[ion-exchange]], [[hydrophobic interaction]] and [[affinity chromatography]] ligands can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vennapusa | first1 = R. R. | last2 = Binner | first2 = S. | last3 = Cabrera | first3 = R. | last4 = Fernandez-Lahore | first4 = M. | title = Surface Energetics to Assess Microbial Adhesion onto Fluidized Chromatography Adsorbents | doi = 10.1002/elsc.200800027 | journal = Engineering in Life Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 530 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the adsorption step is complete, the fluidized bed is washed to flush out any remaining particulates. [[Eluent|Elution]] of the adsorbed proteins was commonly performed with the [[eluent]] flow in the reverse direction; that is, as a conventional packed bed, in order to recover the adsorbed [[solution|solutes]] in a smaller volume of eluent. However, a new generation of EBA columns has been developed, which maintain the bed in the expanded state during this phase, producing high-purity, high yields of e.g. MAbs [monoclonal antibodies] in even smaller volumes of eluent. Process duration at manufacturing scale has also been cut considerably (under 7 hours in some cases).

EBA may be considered to combine both the "Removal of Insolubles" and the "Isolation" steps of the 4-step [[downstream processing]] heuristic. The major limitations associated with EBA technology is biomass interactions and aggregations onto adsorbent during processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vennapusa | first1 = R. | last2 = Hunegnaw | first2 = S. | last3 = Cabrera | first3 = R. | last4 = Fernández-Lahore | first4 = M. | title = Assessing adsorbent–biomass interactions during expanded bed adsorption onto ion exchangers utilizing surface energetics | doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2007.11.078 | journal = Journal of Chromatography A | volume = 1181 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 9–20 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18199439| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where classical column [[chromatography]] uses a solid phase made by a packed bed, EBA uses particles in a [[fluidization|fluidized]] state, ideally expanded by a factor of 2. Expanded bed adsorption is, however, different from fluidised bed chromatography in essentially two ways: one, the EBA resin contains particles of varying size and density which results in a gradient of particle size when expanded; and two, when the bed is in its expanded state, local loops are formed. Particles such as whole cells or cell debris, which would clog a packed bed column, readily pass through a fluidized bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hjorth | first1 = R. | title = Expanded-bed adsorption in industrial bioprocessing: Recent developments | doi = 10.1016/S0167-7799(97)01045-7 | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 230–235 | year = 1997 | pmid =  9183866| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; EBA can therefore be used on crude culture broths or slurries of broken cells, thereby bypassing initial clearing steps such as [[centrifugation]] and [[filtration]], which is mandatory when packed beds are used. In older EBA column designs, the feed flow rate is kept low enough that the solid packing remains stratified and does not fluidize completely. Hence EBA can be modelled as frontal [[adsorption]] in a packed bed, rather than as a well-mixed, continuous-flow adsorber.

'''General Architecture for Text Engineering''' or '''GATE''' is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] suite of tools originally developed at the [[University of Sheffield]] beginning in 1995 and now used worldwide by a wide community of scientists, companies, teachers and students for many [[natural language processing]] tasks, including [[information extraction]] in many languages.&lt;ref&gt;Languages mentioned on http://gate.ac.uk/gate/plugins/ include Arabic, Bulgarian, Cebuano, Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Romanian and Russian.&lt;/ref&gt;

GATE has been compared to [[NLTK]], [[R (programming language)|R]] and [[RapidMiner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/9516|title=Open Source Text Analytics by Seth Grimes - BeyeNETWORK|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being widely used in its own right, it forms the basis of the KIM semantic platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/natural-language-engineering/article/div-classtitlekim-a-semantic-platform-for-information-extraction-and-retrievaldiv/7249CC61F5AB25CBC7AAE182509DFEDE|title=KIM – a semantic platform for information extraction and retrieval|first1=Borislav|last1=Popov|first2=Atanas|last2=Kiryakov|first3=Damyan|last3=Ognyanoff|first4=Dimitar|last4=Manov|first5=Angel|last5=Kirilov|date=1 September 2004|publisher=|volume=10|issue=3-4|pages=375–392|accessdate=17 December 2016|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S135132490400347X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GATE community and research has been involved in several European research projects including [[Transitioning Applications to Ontologies|TAO]], [[SEKT]], NeOn, Media-Campaign, Musing, [[Service-Finder]], LIRICS and [[KnowledgeWeb Project|KnowledgeWeb]], as well as many other projects.

As of May 28, 2011, 881 people are on the gate-users mailing list at SourceForge.net, and 111,932 downloads from [[SourceForge]] are recorded since the project moved to SourceForge in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/gate/|title=GATE|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper "GATE: A Framework and Graphical Development Environment for Robust NLP Tools and Applications"&lt;ref&gt;[http://gate.ac.uk/sale/acl02/acl-main.pdf "GATE: A Framework and Graphical Development Environment for Robust NLP Tools and Applications", by Cunningham H., Maynard D., Bontcheva K. and Tablan V.

== Features ==

GATE includes an [[information extraction]] system called '''ANNIE''' ('''A Nearly-New Information Extraction System''') which is a set of modules comprising a [[Lexical analysis|tokenizer]], a [[gazetteer]], a [[Sentence boundary disambiguation|sentence splitter]], a [[Part-of-speech tagging|part of speech tagger]], a [[Named entity recognition|named entities]] transducer and a [[coreference]] tagger. ANNIE can be used as-is to provide basic [[information extraction]] functionality, or provide a starting point for more specific tasks.

Languages currently handled in GATE include [[English language|English]], [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], [[Arabic]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hindi]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Danish language|Danish]].

Plugins are included for [[machine learning]] with [[Weka (machine learning)|Weka]], RASP, MAXENT, SVM Light, as well as a [[LIBSVM]] integration and an in-house [[perceptron]] implementation, for managing [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] like [[WordNet]], for querying [[search engines]] like [[Google]] or [[Yahoo]], for [[part of speech tagging]] with [[Brill tagger|Brill]] or TreeTagger, and many more. Many external plugins are also available, for handling e.g. [[Twitter|tweets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gate.ac.uk/wiki/twitie.html|title=GATE.ac.uk  - wiki/twitie.html|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GATE accepts input in various formats, such as [[Text file|TXT]], [[HTML]], [[XML]], [[DOC (computing)|Doc]], [[PDF]] documents, and [[Serialization|Java Serial]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[Lucene]], [[Oracle database|Oracle]] Databases with help of [[RDBMS]] storage over [[JDBC]].

[[JAPE (linguistics)|JAPE]] transducers are used within GATE to manipulate annotations on text. Documentation is provided in the GATE User Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gate.ac.uk/userguide/chap:jape|title=GATE.ac.uk  - sale/tao/splitch8.html|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tutorial has also been written by Press Association Images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realizingsemanticweb.blogspot.com/2009/07/jape-grammar-tutorial.html|title=Realizing Semantic Web: JAPE grammar tutorial|first=Dhavalkumar|last=Thakker|date=17 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GATE Mímir ==
&lt;!-- re-written to remove any lingering copyright worries --&gt;
GATE generates vast quantities of information including; natural language text, semantic annotations, and ontological information. Sometimes the data itself is the end product of an application but often the information would be more useful if it could be efficiently searched. GATE Mimir provides support for indexing and searching the linguistic and semantic information generated by such applications and allows for querying the information using arbitrary combinations of text, structural information, and [[SPARQL]].

==Life and career==
Flor studied medicine and natural science at the [[University of Dorpat]], later becoming a professor of zoology. In 1860, he became director of the zoological cabinet, which he remained until his death in 1883 (the zoological cabinet was the predecessor of the Zoology Museum at the University of Tartu, where his 11,815-specimen entomological collection still resides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Zoology: History|url=http://www.ut.ee/BGZM/history/history.html|publisher=University of Tartu Natural History Museum|accessdate=31 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219232716/http://www.ut.ee/BGZM/history/history.html|archivedate=19 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known for his studies of [[Hemiptera]], especially the two-volume work ''Die Rhynchoten Livlands in systematischer Folge beschrieben'' ("''The Hemiptera of [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]], Described In Systematic Order''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary|journal=Entomologist's Monthly Magazine|year=1883–1884|volume=20|url=https://archive.org/stream/entomologistsmo26compgoog#page/n102/mode/1up|accessdate=31 December 2011|page=72|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryder|first=David A.|title=Biographical &amp; Type Information- F|url=http://www.ndsu.nodak.edu/ndsu/rider/Pentatomoidea/Biographical/biographical_F.htm|work=Pentatomidea Home Page|publisher=North Dakota State University, Fargo|accessdate=31 December 2011|year=2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207142230/http://www.ndsu.nodak.edu/ndsu/rider/Pentatomoidea/Biographical/biographical_F.htm|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holographic gratings may exhibit less scattered light than ruled gratings.  Due to their sinusoidal groove profile, holographic gratings cannot be easily blazed and their efficiency is usually considerably less than a comparable ruled grating. However, an exception exists when the ratio of the period to the wavelength is near one; in this case, a holographic grating has virtually the same efficiency as the ruled version.

Holographic master gratings are [[Replicated optic|replicated]] by a process identical to that used for ruled gratings.

'''Hongkonger in the Netherlands''' are people in the [[European Netherlands|Netherlands]] originated from [[Hong Kong]] or having at least once such parent. 

According to [[OECD]] figures there are 9,935 people in the Netherlands migrated from Hong Kong, a figure which would exclude people who declared other sources of origin and people born in the Netherlands to Hong Kong parents.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIG# International Migration Database]". [[OECD]]. Retrieved August 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{As of|2012}}, figures from the [[Netherlands]]' [[Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek]] showed that 9,757 Hong Kong-born persons (4,808 men, 4,949 women), and 8,440 persons with at least one parent born in Hong Kong (4,300 men, 4,140 women). 

The number of persons of Hong Kong background has shown only mild growth, entirely due to natural increase rather than additional migration; in fact the stock of Hong Kong migrants fell by 5.6% during the same period.&lt;ref name="CBS2012"&gt;{{harvnb|CBS|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to F. N. Pieke, Hong Kong was a significant source of Chinese migrants to the Netherlands in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with about 600 to 800 per year, falling off to around 300 to 400 per year by the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Pieke1999a"&gt;{{harvnb|Pieke|1999|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most Hongkongers are [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] by descent, there are Hongkongers who are of [[Chaoshan dialect|Teochew]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]], [[Shanghainese]], [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] or [[South Asians in Hong Kong|South Asia]]n descent, and people from overseas Chinese communities in [[Southeast Asia]]. Owing to Hong Kong's previous status as a British [[crown colony]], the [[British nationality and Hong Kong| British nationality of the inhabitants]] and the existence of people with non-Chinese ancestry, Hongkongers overseas may or may not identify with the Chinese diaspora in the same country. 

One of the sources of Hongkongers in the Netherlands are [[Chinese Indonesians]] who first migrated to Hong Kong and moved onwards to the Netherlands with their children.

The ''' Illinois lunar sample displays ''' are two [[commemorative plaque]]s consisting of small fragments of moon specimen brought back with the [[Apollo 11]] and [[Apollo 17]] lunar missions and given in the 1970s to the people of [[Illinois]] by United States President [[Richard Nixon]] as goodwill gifts.&lt;ref name = "moon rocks Apollo 11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/resources/moonrocks_apollo11.html |title=Where today are the Apollo 11 goodwill lunar sample displays? |first1=Robert |last1=Pearlman|authorlink=Robert Pearlman |publisher=[[CollectSPACE|collectspace.com]] |date=1999–2012 |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "moon rocks Apollo 17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/resources/moonrocks_goodwill.html |title=Where today are the Apollo 17 goodwill lunar sample displays|publisher=collectspace.com |first1=Robert |last1=Pearlman|date=1999–2012 |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

=== Apollo 11 ===
{{main|Apollo 11 lunar sample display}}
The Illinois Apollo 11 lunar sample display commemorative plaque consists of four "moon rock" rice-size particle specimens that were collected by Apollo 11 astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] in 1969 and a small [[Flag of Illinois|Illinois state flag]] that was taken to the moon and back on Apollo 11.&lt;ref name = "moon rocks Apollo 11"/&gt;

The four charcoal-gray "moon rocks" range in size from 1.5 to 3 millimeters (1/16 to 1/8 inch)&lt;ref name="livingmuseum"/&gt; and weigh about 50&amp;nbsp;mg total. They are encased in a clear plastic button the size of a coin which is mounted to a wooden board approximately one foot square on a small [[podium]] pedestal display. The small podium plaque display also has mounted on it a small Illinois flag that had been taken to the moon and back, which lies directly below the "moon rocks", and a formal message from President [[Richard Nixon]] stating that it is a gift to the people of the state of Illinois. Similar lunar sample displays were also distributed to all the other states of the United States and all the countries of the world at the time.&lt;ref name = "moon rocks Apollo 11"/&gt;
[[File:Apollo 17, Goodwill Moon Rock (plaque).jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Apollo 17 lunar plaque display&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Apollo 17 ===
{{main|Apollo 17 lunar sample display}}
The Illinois Apollo 17 lunar sample display commemorative style plaque, measuring 10 by 14 inches, consists of one "moon rock" particle specimen that was cut from [[lunar basalt 70017]] and an Illinois state flag. The [[basalt]] 70017 was collected by Apollo 17 astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]] on the moon in 1972. Once lunar basalt 70017 was brought back to earth from the moon, the basalt moon rock was cut up into small fragments of approximately 1 gram. The specimen was encased in a plastic ball and mounted on the wooden plaque along with the Illinois state flag which had been taken to the moon and back by the crew of Apollo 17. The plaque was then distributed in the 1970s by President Richard Nixon to the people of Illinois as he did for the Apollo 11 plaque display gifts. This was done as a goodwill gesture to promote peace and harmony.&lt;ref name = "moon rocks Apollo 17"/&gt;

== History ==
The Illinois Apollo 11 "goodwill moon rocks" plaque display was received by Illinois Governor [[Richard Ogilvie]] on behalf of the people of the state of Illinois. Ogilvie, in turn, presented the Illinois Apollo 11 lunar samples display to Milton D. Thompson, Director of the [[Illinois State Museum]]. Richard Leary, curator of geology, ultimately handled the display.&lt;ref name = "livingmuseum"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Hunter |first2=Joan |last3=Whitbeck |first3=Gary |last1=Leary |first1=Richard |work=The Living Museum magazine |volume=31 |number=11 |date=March 1970  |url=http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm/ref/collection/ism/id/2733 |title=Moon Fragments Received by Museum|accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The display is now on permanent exhibit in the Illinois State Museum near the Hall of Geology.&lt;ref name = "livingmuseum"/&gt;

While other "goodwill moon rocks" commemorative displays were reported lost or missing by many recipient states,&lt;ref name="moon rocks Apollo 11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moon rocks Apollo 17"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Earth'' magazine, March 2011, pp. 42-51&lt;/ref&gt; both the Illinois Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 "goodwill moon rocks" commemorative plaque displays were kept at the Illinois State Museum. Both were on public display until about 1990. They were then removed and put away in a cabinet. For about 10 years the public did not see the displays, but during that time they were brought for viewing to a Research and Collections Center in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] and to various gem, mineral, and rock shows. In 2010 a student from the [[University of Phoenix]] investigated the whereabouts of the "goodwill moon rocks" as an assignment in investigative techniques. Because of her tenacity, the Illinois State Museum put the displays back on public exhibition that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universetoday.com/50732/searching-for-moon-rocks-here-on-earth/ |title=Searching for Moon Rocks Here on Earth |first1=Nancy |last1=Atkinson |publisher=[[Universe Today]] |date=January 14, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Industrial Revolution''' was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from [[craft production|hand production methods]] to [[machine]]s, new [[chemical manufacturing]] and [[Puddling (metallurgy)|iron production]] processes, the increasing use of [[steam power]], the development of [[machine tool]]s and the rise of the [[factory system]].

[[Textile]]s were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and [[capital (economics)|capital]] invested. The [[textile industry]] was also the first to use modern production methods.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"&gt;{{cite book|author= David S.

An entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution helped drive [[industrialisation]] in Britain which after 1800 was emulated in Belgium, the United States, and France.&lt;ref name="Kiely"/&gt;  --&gt;

The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth.  Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the [[standard of living]] for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Lectures on Economic Growth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feinstein2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SzreterMooney2014"/&gt;

Although the [[structural change]] from agriculture to industry is widely associated with Industrial Revolution, in United Kingdom it was already almost complete by 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Keibek |first=Sebastiaan A.J. |date=2016 |title=The male occupational structure of England and Wales, 1600-1850 |publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and [[social change]]s.&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rehabilitating the Industrial Revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lorenzen"/&gt; [[Eric Hobsbawm]] held that the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s,&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt; while [[T.

[[Textile industry|Mechanized textile production]] spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging [[#Belgium|in Belgium]] and the United States and later textiles in France.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;

An economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the original innovations of the Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized spinning and weaving, slowed and their markets matured. Innovations developed late in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives, steamboats and steamships, [[Hot blast|hot blast iron smelting]] and new technologies, such as the [[electrical telegraph]], widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not powerful enough to drive high rates of growth.  Rapid economic growth began to occur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been called the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].  These new innovations included new steel making processes, the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories.&lt;ref  name="David S.

==Etymology==
The earliest recorded use of the term "Industrial Revolution" seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy [[Louis-Guillaume Otto]], announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise.&lt;ref name="The industrial revolution in national context: Europe and the USA"/&gt; In his 1976 book ''[[Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society]]'', [[Raymond Williams]] states in the entry for "Industry": "The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in [[Robert Southey|Southey]] and [[Robert Owen|Owen]], between 1811 and 1818, and was implicit as early as [[William Blake|Blake]] in the early 1790s and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] at the turn of the [19th] century." The term ''Industrial Revolution'' applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s, as in [[Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui]]'s description in 1837 of ''la révolution industrielle''.&lt;ref&gt;BLANQUI Jérôme-Adolphe, ''Histoire de l'économie politique en Europe depuis les anciens jusqu'à nos jours'', 1837, {{ISBN|978-0-543-94762-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels]] in ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 spoke of "an industrial revolution, a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society".  However, although Engels wrote in the 1840s, his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s, and his expression did not enter everyday language until then. Credit for popularising the term may be given to [[Arnold Toynbee]], whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution13"/&gt;

Some historians, such as [[John Clapham (economic historian)|John Clapham]] and [[Nicholas Crafts]], have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term ''revolution'' is a misnomer. This is still a subject of debate among some historians.

==Important technological developments==
The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations,&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution – Innovations"/&gt; beginning in the second half of the 18th century.  By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies:
* '''Textiles''' – mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water increased the output of a worker by a factor of around 500. The [[power loom]] increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[cotton gin]] increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;  Large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving of wool and linen, but they were not as great as in cotton.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;!--[[File:Watt James von Breda.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[James Watt]] improved on [[Thomas Newcomen|Newcomen]]'s 1712 steam engine with his [[Watt steam engine]] in 1781]]--&gt;
* '''Steam power''' – the efficiency of [[steam engine]]s increased so that they used between one-fifth and one-tenth as much fuel.  The adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them suitable for industrial uses.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|82}}  The high pressure engine had a high power to weight ratio, making it suitable for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|year-1985|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steam power underwent a rapid expansion after 1800.
* '''Iron making''' – the substitution of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost of [[pig iron]] and [[wrought iron]] production.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|89–93}}  Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1= Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Pres|isbn= 978-0-226-72634-2 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in [[economies of scale]].  The steam engine began being used to pump water to power blast air in the mid 1750s, enabling a large increase in iron production by overcoming the limitation of water power.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760.  It was later improved by making it double acting, which allowed higher [[blast furnace]] temperatures.  The [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] produced a structural grade iron at a lower cost than the [[finery forge]].&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969 91"&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mill]] was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron. [[Hot blast]] (1828) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades.
* '''Invention of machine tools''' – The first [[machine tools]] were invented.  These included the [[screw cutting lathe]], cylinder boring machine and the [[Milling (machining)|milling machine]].   Machine tools made the economical manufacture of [[Interchangeable parts|precision metal parts]] possible, although it took several decades to develop effective techniques.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

===Textile manufacture===
{{Main|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}

====British textile industry statistics====
In 1750 Britain imported 2.5 million pounds of raw cotton, most of which was spun and woven by cottage industry in Lancashire. The work was done by hand in workers' homes or occasionally in shops of master weavers. In 1787 raw cotton consumption was 22 million pounds, most of which was cleaned, carded and spun on machines.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|41–42}} The British textile industry used 52 million pounds of cotton in 1800, which increased to 588 million pounds in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrialization and Society|last=Hopkins|first=Eric|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|location=London|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of value added by the cotton textile industry in Britain was 2.6% in 1760, 17% in 1801 and 22.4% in 1831.  Value added by the British woollen industry was 14.1% in 1801.  Cotton factories in Britain numbered approximately 900 in 1797.  In 1760 approximately one-third of cotton cloth manufactured in Britain was exported, rising to two-thirds by 1800.  In 1781 cotton spun amounted to 5.1 million pounds, which increased to 56 million pounds by 1800.  In 1800 less than 0.1% of world cotton cloth was produced on machinery invented in Britain.  In 1788 there were 50,000 spindles in Britain, rising to 7 million over the next 30 years.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

Wages in [[Lancashire]], a core region for cottage industry and later factory spinning and weaving, were about six times those in India in 1770, when overall [[productivity]] in Britain was about three times higher than in India.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Cotton====
Parts of India, China, Central America, South America and the Middle-East have a long history of hand manufacturing [[cotton]] textiles, which became a major industry sometime after 1000 AD. In tropical and subtropical regions where it was grown, most was grown by small farmers alongside their food crops and was spun and woven in households, largely for domestic consumption.  In the 15th century China began to require households to pay part of their taxes in cotton cloth. By the 17th century almost all Chinese wore cotton clothing.  Almost everywhere cotton cloth could be used as a [[medium of exchange]].  In India a significant amount of cotton textiles were manufactured for distant markets, often produced by professional weavers.  Some merchants also owned small weaving workshops. India produced a variety of cotton cloth, some of exceptionally fine quality.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"&gt;{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert|first= Sven|year= 2014|publisher =Vintage Books Division Penguin Random House |location=US|isbn= 978-0-375-71396-5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton was a difficult raw material for Europe to obtain before it was grown on colonial plantations in the Americas.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;  The early Spanish explorers found Native Americans growing unknown species of excellent quality cotton: sea island cotton (''[[Gossypium barbadense]]'') and upland green seeded cotton ''[[Gossypium hirsutum]]''.  Sea island cotton grew in tropical areas and on barrier islands of Georgia and South Carolina, but did poorly inland.  Sea island cotton began being exported from Barbados in the 1650s. Upland green seeded cotton grew well on inland areas of the southern U.S., but was not economical because of the difficulty of removing seed, a problem solved by the [[cotton gin]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|157}} A strain of cotton seed brought from Mexico to Natchez, Mississippi, USA in 1806 became the parent genetic material for over 90% of world cotton production today; it produced [[Cotton Boll|boll]]s that were three to four times faster to pick.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Trade and textiles====
[[File:Colonisation 1754.png|thumb|upright=1.25|European colonial empires at the start of the Industrial Revolution, imposed upon modern political boundaries.]]

The [[Age of Discovery]] was followed by a period of [[colonialism]] beginning around the 16th century. Following the discovery of a trade route to India around southern Africa by the Portuguese, the Dutch established the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (abbr. VOC) or [[Dutch East India Company]] and the British founded the [[East India Company]], along with smaller companies of different nationalities which established trading posts and employed agents to engage in trade throughout the Indian Ocean region and between the Indian Ocean region and North Atlantic Europe.  One of the largest segments of this trade was in cotton textiles, which were purchased in India and sold in Southeast Asia, including the Indonesian archipelago, where spices were purchased for sale to Southeast Asia and Europe.  By the mid-1760s cloth was over three-quarters of the East India Company's exports.  Indian textiles were in demand in North Atlantic region of Europe where previously only wool and linen were available; however, the amount of cotton goods consumed in Western Europe was minor until the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Pre-mechanized European textile production====
By 1600 Flemish refugees began weaving cotton cloth in English towns where cottage spinning and weaving of wool and linen was well established; however, they were left alone by the [[guild]]s who did not consider cotton a threat.  Earlier European attempts at cotton spinning and weaving were in 12th century Italy and 15th century southern Germany, but these industries eventually ended when the supply of cotton was cut off.  The [[Moors]] in Spain grew, spun and wove cotton beginning around the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014" /&gt;

British cloth could not compete with Indian cloth because India's labor cost was approximately one-fifth to one-sixth that of Britain's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Bishnupriya|title=Cotton Textiles and the  Great Divergence: Lancashire, India and Shifting Competitive  Advantage, 1600-1850|url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|website=International Institute of Social History|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Warwick|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1700 and 1721 the British government passed [[Calico Acts]] in order to [[Protectionism|protect]] the domestic woollen and linen industries from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from India.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"/&gt;

The demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around [[Lancashire]] that produced [[fustian]], a cloth with flax [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and cotton [[weft]].  Flax was used for the warp because wheel-spun cotton did not have sufficient strength, but the resulting blend was not as soft as 100% cotton and was more difficult to sew.&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"&gt;{{Cite journal

On the eve of the Industrial Revolution, spinning and weaving were done in households, for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the [[putting-out system]].  Occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver. Under the putting-out system, home-based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers, who often supplied the raw materials.  In the off season the women, typically farmers' wives, did the spinning and the men did the weaving.  Using the [[spinning wheel]], it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one hand loom weaver.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|823}}

====Invention of textile machinery====
The [[flying shuttle]], patented in 1733 by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]], with a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747, doubled the output of a weaver, worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving.  It became widely used around Lancashire after 1760 when John's son, [[Robert Kay (inventor)|Robert]], invented the drop box, which facilitated changing thread colors.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|821–22}}

[[Lewis Paul]] patented the roller [[spinning frame]] and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness. The technology was developed with the help of John Wyatt of [[Birmingham]].  Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in [[Northampton]] with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by [[Daniel Bourn]] in [[Leominster]], but this burnt down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented [[carding]] machines in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first [[cotton mill|cotton spinning mill]]. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by [[Richard Arkwright]] in his [[water frame]] and [[Samuel Crompton]] in his [[spinning mule]].
[[File:Spinning jenny.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|Model of the [[spinning jenny]] in a museum in [[Wuppertal]]. Invented by [[James Hargreaves]] in 1764,  the spinning jenny was one of the innovations that started the revolution.]]
In 1764 in the village of Stanhill, Lancashire, [[James Hargreaves]] invented the [[spinning jenny]], which he patented in 1770. It was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ray Gehani (1998). "Management of Technology and Operations". p. 63. John Wiley and Sons, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a simple, wooden framed machine that only cost about £6 for a 40-spindle model in 1792,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used mainly by home spinners. The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for [[weft]], not [[warp (weaving)|warp]].&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|825–27}}

The [[spinning frame]] or water frame was developed by Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|827–30}}  For each spindle the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle.  The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length.  Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread.  The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight.  The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length.  The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth to be made in Britain.  A horse powered the first factory to use the spinning frame. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.

[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|The only surviving example of a [[spinning mule]] built by the inventor [[Samuel Crompton]].  The mule produced high-quality thread with minimal labour.]]

[[Samuel Crompton]]'s [[spinning mule|Spinning Mule]] was introduced in 1779.  Mule implies a hybrid because it was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame, in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|832}}  Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost.  Mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large quantities.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|832}}

Realising that the expiration of the Arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers, Edmund Cartwright developed a vertical [[power loom]] which he patented in 1785.  In 1776 he patented a two-man operated loom which was more conventional.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|834}}  Cartwright built two factories; the first burned down and the second was sabotaged by his workers. Cartwright's loom design had several flaws, the most serious being thread breakage. Samuel Horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in 1813.  Horock's loom was improved by Richard Roberts in 1822 and these were produced in large numbers by Roberts, Hill &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the Southern United States, who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could be found to remove the seed. [[Eli Whitney]] responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive [[cotton gin]].  A man using a cotton gin could remove seed from as much upland cotton in one day as would previously, working at the rate of one pound of cotton per day, have taken a woman two months to process.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

These advances were capitalised on by [[entrepreneur]]s, of whom the best known is Richard Arkwright. He is credited with a list of inventions, but these were actually developed by such people as [[Thomas Highs]] and [[John Kay (spinning frame)|John Kay]]; Arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created the [[cotton mill]] which brought the production processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power – first horse power and then [[Hydropower|water power]]{{mdash}}which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry. Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of [[yarn]] increased greatly. Before long [[Watt steam engine|steam power]] was applied to drive textile machinery. [[Manchester]] acquired the nickname [[Cottonopolis]] during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Mingay (1986). "The Transformation of Britain, 1830–1939". p. 25. Routledge, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mechanization dramatically decreased the cost of cotton cloth, by the mid-19th century machine-woven cloth still could not equal the quality of hand-woven Indian cloth, in part due to the fineness of thread made possible by the type of cotton used in India, which allowed high thread counts.  However, the high productivity of British textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades of British cloth to undersell hand-spun and woven fabric in low-wage India, eventually destroying the industry.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Wool====
The earliest European attempts at mechanized spinning were with wool; however, wool spinning proved more difficult to mechanize than cotton.  Productivity improvement in wool spinning during the Industrial Revolution was significant but was far less than that of cotton.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name=David_Landes_1999/&gt;

====Silk====
[[File:Silkmill1.jpg|thumb|Lombe's Mill site today, rebuilt as [[Derby Silk Mill]]]]
Arguably the first highly mechanised factory was [[John Lombe]]'s [[Derby Industrial Museum|water-powered silk mill]] at [[Derby]], operational by 1721. Lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in Italy and acting as an industrial spy; however, because the Italian silk industry guarded its secrets closely, the state of the industry at that time is unknown. Although Lombe's factory was technically successful, the supply of raw silk from Italy was cut off to eliminate competition.  In order to promote manufacturing the Crown paid for models of Lombe's machinery which were exhibited in the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=75296|first=Richard L.|last=Hills|title=Cotchett, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=47971|first=K.

===Iron industry===
[[File:Reverberatory furnace diagram.png|thumb|right|The [[reverberatory furnace]] could produce [[cast iron]] using mined coal. The burning coal remained separate from the iron and so did not contaminate the iron with impurities like sulphur and silica. This opened the way to increased iron production.]]

====UK iron production statistics====
Bar iron was the commodity form of iron used as the raw material for making hardware goods such as nails, wire, hinges, horse shoes, wagon tires, chains, etc. and for structural shapes. A small amount of bar iron was converted into steel.  [[Cast iron]] was used for pots, stoves and other items where its brittleness was tolerable.  Most cast iron was refined and converted to bar iron, with substantial losses.  Bar iron was also made by the [[bloomery]] process, which was the predominant iron smelting process until the late 18th century.

In  the UK in 1720 there were 20,500 tons of cast iron produced with charcoal and 400 tons with coke. In 1750 charcoal iron production was 24,500 and coke iron was 2,500 tons.  In 1788 the production of charcoal cast iron was 14,000 tons while coke iron production was 54,000 tons.  In 1806 charcoal cast iron production was 7,800 tons and coke cast iron was 250,000 tons.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

In 1750 the UK imported 31,200 tons of bar iron and either refined from cast iron or directly produced 18,800 tons of bar iron using charcoal and 100 tons using  coke.  In 1796 the UK was making 125,000 tons of bar iron with coke and 6,400 tons with charcoal; imports were 38,000 tons and exports were 24,600 tons. In 1806 the UK did not import bar iron but exported 31,500 tons.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

====Iron process innovations====
A major change in the iron industries during the era of the Industrial Revolution was the replacement of [[wood]] and other bio-fuels with coal. For a given amount of heat, coal required much less labour to mine than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title= American Iron 1607–1900|last=Gordon|first= Robert B|year=1996 |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore and London|isbn= 978-0-8018-6816-0 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coal was much more abundant than wood, supplies of which were becoming scarce before the enormous increase in iron production that took place in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R. F.|year= 1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122}}  By 1750 [[coke (fuel)|coke]] had generally replaced charcoal in smelting of copper and lead and was in widespread use in making glass.  In the smelting and refining of iron, coal and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] produced inferior iron to that made with charcoal because of the coal's sulfur content.  Low sulfur coals were known, but they still contained harmful amounts.  Conversion of coal to coke only slightly reduces the sulfur content.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|122–125}} A minority of coals are coking.

Another factor limiting the iron industry before the Industrial Revolution was the scarcity of water power to power blast bellows.  This limitation was overcome by the steam engine.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;

Use of coal in iron [[smelting]] started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Sir [[Clement Clerke]] and others from 1678, using coal [[reverberatory furnace]]s known as cupolas. These were operated by the flames playing on the [[ore]] and charcoal or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] mixture, [[Redox|reducing]] the [[oxide]] to metal. This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to [[lead]] from 1678 and to [[copper]] from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. (The [[Cupola furnace|foundry cupola]] is a different, and later, innovation.)

By 1709 [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]] made progress using coke to fuel his [[blast furnace]]s at [[Coalbrookdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's intro on Olympics programme |url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |publisher=Awards Daily |first=Ryan|last=Adams|date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the coke [[pig iron]] he made was not suitable for making wrought iron and was used mostly for the production of [[cast iron]] goods, such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs.

Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce [[wrought iron]] until 1755-56, when Darby's son [[Abraham Darby II]] built furnaces at [[Horsehay]] and [[Ketley]] where low sulfur coal was available (and not far from Coalbrookdale).  These new furnaces were equipped with water-powered bellows, the water being pumped by [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen steam engines]].  The Newcomen engines were not attached directly to the blowing cylinders because the engines alone could not produce a steady air blast.  Abraham Darby III installed similar steam-pumped, water-powered blowing cylinders at the Dale Company when he took control in 1768.  The Dale Company used several Newcomen engines to drain its mines and made parts for engines which it sold throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|123–125}}

Steam engines made the use of higher-pressure and volume blast practical; however, the leather used in bellows was expensive to replace. In 1757, iron master [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] patented a hydraulic powered [[blowing engine]] for blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;

[[James Watt]] had great difficulty trying to have a cylinder made for his first steam engine.  In 1774 John Wilkinson, who built a cast iron blowing cylinder for his iron works, invented a precision boring machine for boring cylinders. After Wilkinson bored the first successful cylinder for a [[Boulton and Watt]] steam engine in 1776, he was given an exclusive contract for providing cylinders.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Author Simon Winchester dates the start of the Industrial Revolution to 4th May, 1776, the day that John Wilkinson presented James Watt with his precision-made cylinder. (August 19, 2018 - 10:00 ET)[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1808/19/fzgps.01.html Fareed Zakaria - GPS]. CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;  After Watt developed a rotary steam engine in 1782, they were widely applied to blowing, hammering, rolling and slitting.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

The solutions to the sulfur problem were the addition of sufficient limestone to the furnace to force sulfur into the slag and the use of low sulfur coal.  Use of lime or limestone required higher furnace temperatures to form a free-flowing slag. The increased furnace temperature made possible by improved blowing also increased the capacity of blast furnaces and allowed for increased furnace height.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|123–125}}  In addition to lower cost and greater availability, coke had other important advantages over charcoal in that it was harder and made the column of materials (iron ore, fuel, slag) flowing down the blast furnace more porous and did not crush in the much taller furnaces of the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics|last= Rosenberg|first= Nathan |authorlink= |year=1982 |publisher =Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, New York |isbn=978-0-521-27367-1 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first= David.

As cast iron became cheaper and widely available, it began being a structural material for bridges and buildings.  A famous early example was the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] built in 1778 with cast iron produced by [[Abraham Darby III]].&lt;ref name="Iron bridge"/&gt;  However, most cast iron was converted to [[wrought iron]].

Europe relied on the [[bloomery]] for most of its wrought iron until the large scale production of cast iron.  Conversion of cast iron was done in a [[finery forge]], as it long had been.  An improved refining process known as [[potting and stamping]] was developed, but this was superseded by [[Henry Cort]]'s [[Puddling furnace|puddling]] process. Cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes: [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]] in 1783 and [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] in 1784.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|91}}  Puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost.

[[Puddling (metallurgy)|Puddling]] was a means of decarburizing molten pig iron by slow oxidation in a reverberatory furnace by manually stirring it with a long rod.  The decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler.  When the glob was large enough, the puddler would remove it.  Puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work.  Few puddlers lived to be 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace, coal or coke could be used as fuel.  The puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel.  Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised. Rolling was an important part of the puddling process because the grooved rollers expelled most of the molten slag and consolidated the mass of hot wrought iron. Rolling was 15 times faster at this than a [[trip hammer]].  A different use of rolling, which was done at lower temperatures than that for expelling slag, was in the production of iron sheets, and later structural shapes such as beams, angles and rails.
 
The puddling process was improved in 1818 by Baldwyn Rogers, who replaced some of the sand lining on the reverberatory furnace bottom with iron oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute|url={{Google books|_tijGo0WWHMC|page=PA20|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1879|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1838 [[Joseph Hall (metallurgist)|John Hall]] patented the use of roasted tap cinder (iron silicate) for the furnace bottom, greatly reducing the loss of iron through increased slag caused by a sand lined bottom. The tap cinder also tied up some phosphorus, but this was not understood at the time.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|166}}  Hall's process also used iron scale or rust, which reacted with carbon in the molten iron. Hall's process, called ''wet puddling'', reduced losses of iron with the slag from almost 50% to around 8%.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|93}}

Puddling became widely used after 1800. Up to that time British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of iron imported from Sweden and Russia to supplement domestic supplies.  Because of the increased British production, imports began to decline in 1785 and by the 1790s Britain eliminated imports and became a net exporter of bar iron.

[[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron.  By using preheated combustion air, the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity.  Using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron.  This meant that lower quality coal or [[anthracite]] could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics

Shortly before the Industrial Revolution an improvement was made in the production of [[steel]], which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs. [[Benjamin Huntsman]] developed his [[crucible steel]] technique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by the [[cementation process]].

The supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries, such as those making nails, hinges, wire and other hardware items. The development of [[machine tool]]s allowed better working of iron, causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries.

===Steam power===
{{Main|Steam power during the Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A [[Watt steam engine]]. [[James Watt]] transformed the [[steam engine]] from a  [[reciprocating motion]] that was used for pumping to a [[Rotation|rotating motion]] suited to industrial applications.  Watt and others significantly improved the efficiency of the steam engine.]]

The development of the [[stationary steam engine]] was an important element of the Industrial Revolution; however, during the early period of the Industrial Revolution, most industrial power was supplied by water and wind.  In Britain by 1800 an estimated 10,000 horsepower was being supplied by steam.  By 1815 steam power had grown to 210,000&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was due to [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698. He constructed and patented in London a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump, that generated about one [[horsepower]] (hp) and was used in numerous water works and in a few mines (hence its "brand name", ''The Miner's Friend''). Savery's pump was economical in small horsepower ranges, but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes.  Savery pumps continued to be produced until the late 18th century.

The first successful piston steam engine was introduced by [[Thomas Newcomen]] before 1712. A number of Newcomen engines were installed in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a significant amount of capital to build, and produced upwards of {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}}. They were also used to power municipal water supply pumps.  They were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century. By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread (first) to Hungary in 1722, Germany, Austria, and Sweden. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. In the 1770s the engineer [[John Smeaton]] built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;

[[File:Newcomens Dampfmaschine aus Meyers 1890.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen's steam-powered atmospheric engine]] was the first practical piston steam engine. Subsequent steam engines were to power the Industrial Revolution.]]

A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by [[Scottish people|Scotsman]] [[James Watt]]. With financial support from his business partner [[English people|Englishman]] [[Matthew Boulton]], he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]], which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder, thereby making the low-pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber.  The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder, which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam.  Likewise, the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency.  These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton &amp; Watts engines used only 20–25% as much coal per horsepower-hour as Newcomen's. Boulton and Watt opened the [[Soho Foundry]] for the manufacture of such engines in 1795.

By 1783 the Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a [[Single- and double-acting cylinders|double-acting]] rotative type, which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill. Both of Watt's basic engine types were commercially very successful, and by 1800, the firm [[Boulton and Watt|Boulton &amp; Watt]] had constructed 496 engines, with 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving [[blast furnace]]s, and 308 powering mill machinery; most of the engines generated from {{convert|5|to|10|hp|abbr=on}}.

Until about 1800 the most common pattern of steam engine was the [[beam engine]], built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained rotative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the [[table engine]]. Around the start of the 19th century, at which time the Boulton and Watt patent expired, the Cornish engineer [[Richard Trevithick]] and the American [[Oliver Evans]] began to construct higher-pressure non-condensing steam engines, exhausting against the atmosphere. High pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail [[locomotive]]s and [[steamboat|steam boats]].

The development of [[machine tool]]s, such as the engine [[lathe]], [[Planer (metalworking)|planing]], milling and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines.

Small industrial power requirements continued to be provided by animal and human muscle until widespread [[electrification]] in the early 20th century. These included [[crank (mechanism)|crank]]-powered, [[treadle]]-powered and horse-powered workshop and light industrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter&amp;Bryant|1991|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machine tools===

{{See also|Interchangeable parts}}
[[File:Maudslay screw-cutting lathes of circa 1797 and 1800.png|thumb|[[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay]]'s famous early [[screw-cutting lathe]]s of circa 1797 and 1800]]
[[File:Middletown milling machine 1818--001.png|thumb|The Middletown [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] of circa 1818, associated with Robert Johnson and Simeon North]]

Pre-industrial machinery was built by various craftsmen – [[millwright]]s built water and windmills, [[carpenter]]s made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time.  As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common.  Other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners, such as machine screws, bolts and nuts. There was also the need for precision in making parts.  Precision would allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts and standardization of threaded fasteners.

The demand for metal parts led to the development of several [[machine tool]]s. They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms.

Before the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws and chisels. Consequently, the use of metal machine parts was kept to a minimum.  Hand methods of production were very laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

The first large precision machine tool was the cylinder [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring machine]] invented by [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] in 1774. It used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. Wilkinson's boring machine differed from earlier [[cantilever]]ed machines used for boring cannon in that the cutting tool was mounted on a beam that ran through the cylinder being bored and was supported outside on both ends.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

The [[Planer (metalworking)|planing machine]], the [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] and the [[Shaper|shaping machine]] were developed in the early decades of the 19th century. Although the milling machine was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

[[Henry Maudslay]], who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a mechanic with superior ability who had been employed at the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]]. He worked as an apprentice in the Royal Gun Foundry of [[Jan Verbruggen]]. In 1774 [[Jan Verbruggen]] had installed a [[horizontal boring machine]] in Woolwich which was the first industrial size [[Lathe]] in the UK. Maudslay was hired away by [[Joseph Bramah]] for the production of high-security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship.  Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe.  Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw.  Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|392–95}}  The slide rest lathe was called one of history's most important inventions.  Although it was not entirely Maudslay's idea, he was the first person to build a functional lathe using a combination of known innovations of the lead screw, slide rest and change gears.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|31, 36}}

Maudslay left Bramah's employment and set up his own shop. He was engaged to build the machinery for making ships' pulley blocks for the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]]. These machines were all-metal and were the first machines for [[mass production]] and making components with a degree of [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeability]]. The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools, and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work, such as [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]], [[Joseph Clement]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

[[James Fox (engineer)|James Fox]] of [[Derby]] had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century, as did [[Matthew Murray]] of Leeds. Roberts was a maker of high-quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement.

The impact of machine tools during the Industrial Revolution was not that great because other than firearms, threaded fasteners and a few other industries there were few mass-produced metal parts. The techniques to make mass-produced metal parts made with sufficient precision to be [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] is largely attributed to a program of the U.S. Department of War which perfected [[interchangeable parts]] for firearms in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the half century following the invention of the fundamental machine tools the [[machine industry]] became the largest industrial sector of the U.S. economy, by value added.&lt;ref name="faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu"&gt;Economics 323–2: Economic History of the United States Since 1865 http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jmokyr/Graphs-and-Tables.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals===
The large-scale production of [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] was an important development during the Industrial Revolution. The first of these was the production of [[Sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]] by the [[lead chamber process]] invented by the Englishman [[John Roebuck]] ([[James Watt]]'s first partner) in 1746. He was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger, less expensive chambers made of [[rivet]]ed sheets of [[lead]]. Instead of making a small amount each time, he was able to make around {{convert|100|lb|-1}} in each of the chambers, at least a tenfold increase.

The production of an [[alkali]] on a large scale became an important goal as well, and [[Nicolas Leblanc]] succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of [[sodium carbonate]]. The [[Leblanc process]] was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and [[hydrochloric acid]]. The [[sodium sulfate|sodium sulphate]] was heated with [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and [[calcium sulfide|calcium sulphide]]. Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide. The process produced a large amount of pollution (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic [[sodium carbonate|soda ash]] proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants ([[barilla]]) or from [[kelp]], which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash,&lt;ref name="Clow52"/&gt; and also to [[potash]] ([[potassium carbonate]]) produced from hardwood ashes.

These two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes. Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and [[paper]] industries. Early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and for [[bleach]]ing cloth.

The development of bleaching powder ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) by Scottish chemist [[Charles Tennant]] in about 1800, based on the discoveries of French chemist [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk. Tennant's factory at St Rollox, North [[Glasgow]], became the largest chemical plant in the world.

After 1860 the focus on chemical innovation was in [[dye]]stuffs, and Germany took world leadership, building a strong chemical industry.&lt;ref&gt;Lion Hirth, ''State, Cartels and Growth: The German Chemical Industry'' (2007) p 20&lt;/ref&gt; Aspiring chemists flocked to German universities in the 1860–1914 era to learn the latest techniques. British scientists by contrast, lacked research universities and did not train advanced students; instead, the practice was to hire German-trained chemists.&lt;ref&gt;Johann P. Murmann, ''Knowledge and competitive advantage:''
the co-evolution of firms, technology, and national institutions ''(2003) pp&amp;nbsp;53–54''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cement===
[[File:Thamestunnel.jpg|thumb|The [[Thames Tunnel]] (opened 1843).&lt;br /&gt;[[Cement]] was used in the world's first underwater tunnel.]]
In 1824 [[Joseph Aspdin]], a British [[bricklayer]] turned builder, patented a chemical process for making [[portland cement]] which was an important advance in the building trades. This process involves [[sintering]] a mixture of [[clay]] and [[limestone]] to about {{convert|1400|°C|0|abbr=on}}, then [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand and [[gravel]] to produce [[concrete]]. Portland cement was used by the famous English engineer [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] several years later when constructing the [[Thames Tunnel]].&lt;ref name="memphis"/&gt; Cement was used on a large scale in the construction of the [[London sewerage system]] a generation later.

===Gas lighting===
{{Main|Gas lighting}}
Another major industry of the later Industrial Revolution was [[gas lighting]]. Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere, the large-scale introduction of this was the work of [[William Murdoch]], an employee of Boulton &amp; Watt, the [[Birmingham]] [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]] pioneers. The process consisted of the large-scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the purification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonia, and heavy hydrocarbons), and its storage and distribution. The first gas lighting utilities were established in London between 1812 and 1820. They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK. Gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil. Its introduction allowed nightlife to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before.

===Glass making===
{{Main|Glass production}}
[[File:Crystal Palace interior.jpg|thumb|The Crystal Palace held the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] of 1851]]
A new method of producing glass, known as the [[Cylinder blown sheet glass|cylinder process]], was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process was used by the [[Chance Brothers]] to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. [[The Crystal Palace]] is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure.

===Paper machine===
{{Main|Paper machine}}
A machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by Nicholas Louis Robert who worked for [[Saint-Léger Didot]] family in France. The paper machine is known as a Fourdrinier after the financiers, brothers Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], who were [[stationers]] in London. Although greatly improved and with many variations, the Fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today.

The method of [[continuous production]] demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other [[continuous production]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Industrial technologies that affected farming included the [[seed drill]], the [[British Agricultural Revolution#The Dutch and Rotherham swing (wheel-less) plough|Dutch plough]], which contained iron parts, and the threshing machine.

[[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] invented an improved seed drill in 1701. It was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and planted them at the correct depth.  This was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five.  Tull's seed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have much of an impact. Good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Foljambe's ''Rotherham [[plough]]'' of 1730 was the first commercially successful iron plough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; and was the final straw for many farm labourers, who faced near starvation, leading to the 1830 agricultural rebellion of the [[Swing Riots]].

[[Machine tools]] and metalworking techniques developed during the Industrial Revolution eventually resulted in precision manufacturing techniques in the late 19th century for mass-producing agricultural equipment, such as reapers, binders and combine harvesters.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

===Mining===
[[History of coal mining|Coal mining]] in Britain, particularly in [[South Wales]], started early. Before the steam engine, [[Open-pit mining|pits]] were often shallow [[bell pit]]s following a seam of coal along the surface, which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined by means of an [[adit]] or [[Drift mining|drift mine]] driven into the side of a hill. [[Shaft mining]] was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a [[sough]] (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity. The introduction of the steam pump by [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698 and the [[Newcomen steam engine]] in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption of [[John Smeaton]]'s improvements to the Newcomen engine followed by James Watt's more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable.  The [[Cornish engine]], developed in the 1810s, was much more efficient than the [[Watt steam engine]].

Coal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of [[firedamp]] in many coal seams. Some degree of safety was provided by the [[safety lamp]] which was invented in 1816 by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] and independently by [[George Stephenson]]. However, the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light. Firedamp explosions continued, often setting off [[coal dust]] [[explosion]]s, so casualties grew during the entire 19th century. Conditions of work were very poor, with a high casualty rate from rock falls.

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport during the British Industrial Revolution}}
{{See also| Productivity improving technologies (economic history)#Infrastructures}}

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea. [[Wagonway]]s were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been widely constructed. Animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.  The first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the 18th century, with steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the 19th century.  Improving sailing technologies boosted average sailing speed 50% between 1750 and 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coren|first1=Michael J.|title=The speed of Europe's 18th-century sailing ships is revamping history's view of the Industrial Revolution|url=https://qz.com/1193455/the-speed-of-europes-18th-century-sailing-ships-is-revamping-historians-view-of-the-industrial-revolution/|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Industrial Revolution improved Britain's transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network, a canal and waterway network, and a railway network. Raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before. Improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly.

====Canals and improved waterways====
{{Main|History of the British canal system}}
[[File:Barton-on-Irwell 11.05.02R.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Bridgewater Canal]], famous because of its commercial success, crossing the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], one of the last canals to be built.]]

Before and during the Industrial Revolution navigation on several British rivers was improved by removing obstructions, straightening curves, widening and deepening and building navigation [[Lock (water navigation)|lock]]s.  Britain had over 1000 miles of navigable rivers and streams by 1750.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|46}}

Canals and waterways allowed bulk materials to be economically transported long distances inland.  This was because a horse could pull a barge with a load dozens of times larger than the load that could be drawn in a cart.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grübler"&gt;{{Cite book

Building of canals dates to ancient times.  The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] in China, "the world's largest artificial waterway and oldest canal still in existence," parts of which were started between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, is {{convert|1121|mi|0|abbr=out}} long and links [[Hangzhou]] with Beijing.&lt;ref name="Langmead"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Langmead|title=Encyclopedia of Architectural and Engineering Feats|url={{Google books|T5J6GKvGbmMC|page=PA37|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=15 February 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-112-0|page=37|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, canals began to be built in the late 18th century to link the major manufacturing centres across the country.  Known for its huge commercial success, the [[Bridgewater Canal]] in [[North West England]], which opened in 1761 and was mostly funded by [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|The 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]].  From [[Worsley]] to the rapidly growing town of [[Manchester]] its construction cost £168,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|168000|1761|2013|r=-1}}}} {{As of|2013|lc=y}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Timbs|1860|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761, the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half.&lt;ref name=Bridgewatercollieries&gt;{{Citation |title=The Times newspaper: Bridgewater Collieries | url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1985-12-31&amp;fromDate=1785-01-01&amp;currentPageNumber=1&amp;resultsPerPage=10&amp;sortBy=default&amp;offset=0&amp;viewName=&amp;addFilters=&amp;removeFilters=&amp;addCat=&amp;queryKeywords=bridgewater+canal&amp;sectionId=1040&amp;currPgSmartSet=1&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08&amp;articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08-001&amp;xmlpath=&amp;pubId=17&amp;totalResults=1638&amp;addRefineFilters=&amp;removeRefineFilters=&amp;addRefineCat=&amp;next_Page=false&amp;prev_Page=false&amp;date_dd_From=1&amp;date_mm_From=01&amp;date_yyyy_From=1785&amp;date_dd_to_range=31&amp;date_mm_to_range=12&amp;date_yyyy_to_range=1985&amp;date_dd_from_precise=1&amp;date_mm_from_precise=01&amp;date_yyyy_from_precise=1785&amp;isDateSearch=false&amp;dateSearchType=range&amp;refineQuerykeywordText= |date=1 December 1913 |accessdate=19 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as [[Canal Mania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kindleberger|1993|pp=192–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; New canals were hastily built in the aim of replicating the commercial success of the Bridgewater Canal, the most notable being the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] and the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] which opened in 1774 and 1789 respectively.

By the 1820s a national network was in existence. Canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways. They were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on. The last major canal to be built in the United Kingdom was the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], which upon opening in 1894 was the largest [[ship canal]] in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=1 January 1894: Opening of the Manchester ship canal |quote=Six years in the making, the world's largest navigation canal gives the city direct access to the sea |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/17/guardian190-manchester-ship-canal-opens |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 January 1894 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened Manchester as a [[Port of Manchester|port]]. However it never achieved the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for and signalled canals as a dying mode of transport in an age dominated by railways, which were quicker and often cheaper.

Britain's canal network, together with its surviving mill buildings, is one of the most enduring features of the early Industrial Revolution to be seen in Britain.

====Roads====
[[File:Rakeman – First American Macadam Road.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of the first macadam road in the United States (1823). In the foreground, workers are breaking stones "so as not to exceed 6 ounces in weight or to pass a two-inch ring".&lt;ref name="rakemanPainting"&gt;[http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/rakeman/1823.htm "1823 – First American Macadam Road"] ''(Painting – [[Carl Rakeman]])'' US Department of Transportation – Federal Highway Administration (Accessed 10 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

France was known for having an excellent system of roads at the time of the Industrial Revolution; however, most of the roads on the European Continent and in the U.K. were in bad condition and dangerously rutted.&lt;ref name="Grübler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter_1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville |page=18}}''"There exist everywhere roads suitable for hauling".''[[Robert Fulton]] on roads in France&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the original British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes, but from the 1720s (and occasionally earlier) [[Toll road|turnpike]] trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads. Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent that almost every main road in England and Wales was the responsibility of a [[Turnpike trusts|turnpike trust]]. New engineered roads were built by [[John Metcalf (civil engineer)|John Metcalf]], [[Thomas Telford]] and most notably [[John Loudon McAdam|John McAdam]], with the first '[[macadam]]ised' stretch of road being Marsh Road at Ashton Gate, Bristol in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown (1991). "Society and Economy in Modern Britain 1700–1850" p. 136. Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The major turnpikes radiated from London and were the means by which the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest of the country. Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow, broad wheeled, carts hauled by teams of horses. Lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of [[Packhorse|pack horse]]. Stagecoaches carried the rich, and the less wealthy could pay to ride on [[Un-sprung cart|carriers carts]].

====Railways====
{{Main|History of rail transport in Great Britain}}
[[File:Opening Liverpool and Manchester Railway.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting the [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in 1830, the first inter-city railway in the world and which spawned [[Railway Mania]] due to its success.]]

Reducing friction was one of the major reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons. This was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in 1805 at Croydon, England.
&lt;blockquote&gt;“A good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds, or one ton.  A party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment, that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration.  Twelve wagons were loaded with stones, till each wagon weighed three tons, and the wagons were fastened together.  A horse was then attached, which drew the wagons with ease, six miles in two hours, having stopped four times, in order to show he had the power of starting, as well as drawing his great load.”&lt;ref&gt;

Railways were made practical by the widespread introduction of inexpensive [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddled iron]] after 1800, the [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mill]] for making rails, and the development of the high-pressure steam engine also around 1800.

Wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal. These were all horse drawn or relied on gravity, with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline. The first applications of the steam [[locomotive]] were on wagon or plate ways (as they were then often called from the cast-iron plates used). Horse-drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the 19th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production were lowering costs. See: [[Industrial Revolution#Metallurgy|Metallurgy]]

Steam locomotives began being built after the introduction of high-pressure steam engines after the expiration of the [[Boulton and Watt]] patent in 1800. High-pressure engines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere, doing away with the condenser and cooling water.  They were also much lighter weight and smaller in size for a given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines.  A few of these early locomotives were used in mines.  Steam-hauled public railways began with the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825.

The rapid introduction of railways followed the 1829 [[Rainhill Trials]], which demonstrated [[Robert Stephenson]]'s successful locomotive design and the 1828 development of [[Hot blast]], which dramatically reduced the fuel consumption of making iron and increased the capacity the [[blast furnace]].

On 15 September 1830, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was opened, the first inter-city railway in the world and was attended by Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert L. Sussman (2009). "Victorian Technology: Invention, Innovation, and the Rise of the Machine". p. 2. ABC-CLIO, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The railway was engineered by [[Joseph Locke]] and [[George Stephenson]], linked the rapidly expanding industrial town of [[Manchester]] with the port town of [[Liverpool]]. The [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opening]] was marred by problems, due to the primitive nature of the technology being employed, however problems were gradually ironed out and the railway became highly successful, transporting passengers and freight. The success of the inter-city railway, particularly in the transport of freight and commodities, led to [[Railway Mania]].

Construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first Industrial Revolution. After many of the workers had completed the railways, they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities, providing additional workers for the factories.

===Other developments===
Other developments included more efficient [[water wheel]]s, based on experiments conducted by the British engineer [[John Smeaton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Social effects==
{{Main|Life in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution}}

===Factory system===
{{Main|Factory system}}
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most of the workforce was employed in agriculture, either as self-employed farmers as landowners or tenants, or as landless agricultural labourers. It was common for families in various parts of the world to spin yarn, weave cloth and make their own clothing.  Households also spun and wove for market production.  At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution India, China and regions of Iraq and elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East produced most of the world's cotton cloth while Europeans produced wool and linen goods.

In Britain by the 16th century the [[putting-out system]], by which farmers and townspeople produced goods for market in their homes, often described as ''cottage industry'', was being practiced.  Typical putting out system goods included spinning and weaving.  Merchant capitalist typically provided the raw materials, paid workers by the [[Piece work|piece]], and were responsible for the sale of the goods.  Embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor quality were common problems.  The logistical effort in procuring and distributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations of the putting out system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early spinning and weaving machinery, such as a [[spinning jenny|40 spindle jenny]] for about six pounds in 1792,  was affordable for cottagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later machinery such as spinning frames, [[spinning mule]]s and power looms were expensive (especially if water powered), giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories.

The majority of textile factory workers during the Industrial Revolution were unmarried women and children, including many orphans.  They typically worked for 12 to 14 hours per day with only Sundays off.  It was common for women take factory jobs seasonally during slack periods of farm work.  Lack of adequate transportation, long hours and poor pay made it difficult to recruit and maintain workers.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;	Many workers, such as displaced farmers and agricultural workers, who had nothing but their labour to sell, became factory workers out of necessity.  (See: [[British Agricultural Revolution]], [[Threshing machine]])

The change in the social relationship of the factory worker compared to farmers and cottagers was viewed unfavourably by [[Karl Marx]], however, he recognized the increase in productivity made possible by technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Standards of living===
Some economists, such as [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert E. Lucas, Jr.]], say that the real impact of the Industrial Revolution was that "for the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth&amp;nbsp;... Nothing remotely like this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists, even as a theoretical possibility."&lt;ref name="Lectures on Economic Growth"/&gt; Others, however, argue that while growth of the economy's overall productive powers was unprecedented during the Industrial Revolution, living standards for the majority of the population did not grow meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries, and that in many ways workers' living standards declined under early capitalism: for instance, studies have shown that real wages in Britain only increased 15% between the 1780s and 1850s, and that life expectancy in Britain did not begin to dramatically increase until the 1870s.&lt;ref name="Feinstein2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=Charles|title=Pessimism Perpetuated: Real Wages and the Standard of Living in Britain during and after the Industrial Revolution|journal=Journal of Economic History|date=September 1998|volume=58|issue=3|pages=625–58|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4123540|accessdate=6 May 2014|doi=10.1017/s0022050700021100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SzreterMooney2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Szreter &amp; Mooney|title=Urbanization, Mortality, and the Standard of Living Debate: New Estimates of the Expectation of Life at Birth in Nineteenth-Century British Cities|journal=The Economic History Review|date=February 1998|volume=51|issue=1|page=104|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.00084|last2=Mooney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the average height of the population declined during the Industrial Revolution, implying that their nutritional status was also decreasing. Real wages were not keeping up with the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Küchenhoff |first1=Helmut |date=2012 |title=The Diminution of Physical Stature of the British Male Population in the 18th-Century |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/afc/cliome/v6y2012i1p45-62.html |journal=Cliometrica |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=45–62 |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snowdon |first1=Brian |date=April–June 2005 |title=Measures of Progress and Other Tall Stories: From Income to Anthropometrics |url=https://www.worldeconomics.com/Journal/Papers/Measures%20of%20Progress%20and%20Other%20Tall%20Stories.details?ID=209 |journal=World Economics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87–136 |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Industrial Revolution, the [[life expectancy]] of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730–1749 to 31.8% in 1810–1829.&lt;ref name="Buer"/&gt;

The effects on living conditions the industrial revolution have been very controversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Woodward81"/&gt; A series of 1950s essays by [[Henry Phelps Brown]] and Sheila V. Hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population, that was at the bottom of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living standards.&lt;ref name="Woodward81"/&gt; During 1813–1913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.&lt;ref name="Trends in Real Wages in Britain, 1750-1913"/&gt;&lt;ref name="econlib"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hartwell"/&gt;

====Food and nutrition====
{{Main|British Agricultural Revolution}}
Chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including Britain and France, until the late 19th century. Until about 1750, in large part due to malnutrition, life expectancy in France was about 35 years and about 40 years in Britain. The United States population of the time was adequately fed, much taller on average and had life expectancy of 45–50 years although U.S. life expectancy declined by a few years by the mid 19th century. Food consumption per capita also declined during an episode known as the [[Antebellum Puzzle]].&lt;ref name="The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700-2100"/&gt;

Food supply in Great Britain was adversely affected by the [[Corn Laws]] (1815-1846).  The Corn Laws, which imposed tariffs on imported grain, were enacted to keep prices high in order to benefit domestic producers.  The Corn Laws were repealed in the early years of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]].

The initial technologies of the Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized textiles, iron and coal, did little, if anything, to lower food prices.&lt;ref name="Pomeranz 2000"/&gt; In Britain and the Netherlands, food supply increased before the Industrial Revolution due to better agricultural practices; however, population grew too, as noted by [[Thomas Malthus]].&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

====Housing====
The very rapid growth in population in the 19th century in the cities included the new industrial and manufacturing cities, as well as service centers such as Edinburgh and London.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory  Clark,  "Shelter from the storm: housing and the industrial revolution, 1550–1909." ''Journal of Economic History'' 62#2 (2002): 489–511.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical factor was financing, which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with  large contracting firms.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, "The speculative builders and developers of Victorian London." ''Victorian Studies'' 11 (1968): 641–90.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825462 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Powell, ''The British building industry since 1800: An economic history'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;   Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. P. Kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kemp, "Housing landlordism in late nineteenth-century Britain." ''Environment and Planning A'' 14.11 (1982): 1437–47.&lt;/ref&gt;  People moved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low-income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums. Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and tuberculosis among young adults. [[Cholera]] from polluted water and typhoid were endemic. Unlike rural areas, there were no famines such as devastated Ireland in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, "The Slums of Victorian London." ''Victorian Studies'' 11.1 (1967): 5–40. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825891 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony S. Wohl, ''The eternal slum: housing and social policy in Victorian London'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Daunton, ''House and home in the Victorian city: working-class housing, 1850–1914'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

A large exposé literature grew up condemning the unhealthy conditions. By far the most famous publication was by one of the founders of the Socialist movement, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 [[Friedrich Engels]] described backstreet sections of Manchester and other mill towns, where people lived in crude shanties and shacks, some not completely enclosed, some with dirt floors.  These shanty towns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and dwellings.  There were no sanitary facilities. Population density was extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;Enid Gauldie, ''Cruel habitations: a history of working-class housing 1780-1918''  (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  Not everyone lived in such poor conditions. The Industrial Revolution also created a middle class of businessmen, clerks, foremen and engineers who lived in much better conditions.

Conditions improved over the course of the 19th century due to new public health acts regulating things such as sewage, hygiene and home construction. In the introduction of his 1892 edition, Engels notes that most of the conditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved. For example, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] led to the more sanitary [[byelaw terraced house]].

====Sanitation====
In ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 [[Friedrich Engels]] described how untreated sewage created awful odors and turned the rivers green in industrial cities.

In 1854 [[John Snow]] traced a cholera outbreak in Soho to fecal contamination of a public water well by a home cesspit.  Snow's findings that cholera could be spread by contaminated water took some years to be accepted, but his work led to fundamental changes in the design of public water and waste systems.

====Water supply====
Pre-industrial water supply relied on gravity systems and pumping of water was done by water wheels.  Pipes were typically made of wood.  Steam powered pumps and iron pipes allowed the widespread piping of water to horse watering troughs and households.&lt;ref name="Hunter_1985"/&gt;

====Increase in literacy====
The invention of the [[paper machine]] and the application of steam power to the industrial processes of [[printing]] supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which contributed to rising literacy and demands for mass political participation.

===Clothing and consumer goods===
[[File:BLW Tea and coffee service, Staffordshire.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wedgwood]] tea and coffee service]]
Consumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils, and in the following decades, stoves for cooking and space heating.  Coffee, tea, sugar, tobacco and chocolate became affordable to many in Europe.  Watches and household clocks became popular consumer items.

Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes in Britain, potter and entrepreneur [[Josiah Wedgwood]], founder of [[Wedgwood]] fine china and porcelain, created goods such as [[tableware]], which was starting to become a common feature on dining tables.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;

===Population increase===
The Industrial Revolution was the first period in history during which there was a simultaneous increase in both population and per capita income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Industrial Revolution|last=Hudson|first= Pat|year=1992 |publisher =Routledge, Chapman and Hall, Inc.
|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-7131-6531-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Hughes in ''The Fatal Shore'', the [[Demography of England|population of England]] and Wales, which had remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740, rose dramatically after 1740. The population of England had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801 to 16.8 million in 1850 and, by 1901, had nearly doubled again to 30.5 million.&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;  Improved conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 1800s.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

===Urbanization===
The growth of modern industry since the late 18th century led to massive [[urbanisation]] and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas.  In 1800, only 3% of the world's population lived in cities,&lt;ref name="prb"/&gt; compared to nearly 50% today (the beginning of the 21st century).&lt;ref name="prb6"/&gt; Manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3 million.&lt;ref name="britannica7"/&gt;

===Impact on women and family life===
Women's historians have debated the effect of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism generally on the status of women.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Amico, ed. ''Reader's guide to women's studies'' (1998) pp 102–4, 306–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Thomas, "Women and capitalism: oppression or emancipation? A review article." ''Comparative studies in society and history'' 30#3 (1988): 534–49. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/178999 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a pessimistic side, [[Alice Clark]] argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th century England, it lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in 16th-century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labour with the husband taking paid labour jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle- and upper-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on powerful women.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Clark, ''Working life of women in the seventeenth century'' (1919).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more positive interpretation, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Ivy Pinchbeck, ''Women Workers in the Industrial Revolution'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;  Tilly and Scott have emphasised the continuity in the status of women, finding three stages in English history. In the pre-industrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the "family wage economy" of early industrialisation; the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the "family consumer economy," in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott, ''Women, work, and family'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas of thrift and hard work characterized middle-class families as the Industrial Revolution swept Europe. These values were displayed in Samuel Smiles' book ''Self-Help'', in which he states that the misery of the poorer classes was "voluntary and self-imposed - the results of idleness, thriftlessness, intemperance, and misconduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thrift|last=Smiles|first=Samuel|publisher=John Murray|year=1875|isbn=|location=London|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour conditions===

====Social structure and working conditions====
In terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a [[middle class]] of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. As late as the year 1900, most industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10-hour day (12 hours in the steel industry), yet earned from 20% to 40% less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life;&lt;ref name="countrystudies"/&gt; however, most workers in textiles, which was by far the leading industry in terms of employment, were women and children.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;  For workers of the laboring classes, industrial life "was a stony desert, which they had to make habitable by their own efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industry and Empire: From 1750 to the Present Day|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric J.|publisher=Penguin|year=1969|isbn=978-1565845619|volume=3|location=Harmondsworth, England|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place. [[Pre-industrial society]] was very static and often cruel – [[child labour]], dirty living conditions, and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="industrial4"/&gt;

====Factories and urbanisation====
{{Main|Factory system}}
[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|left|Manchester, England ("[[Cottonopolis]]"), pictured in 1840, showing the mass of factory chimneys]]

Industrialisation led to the creation of the [[factory]]. The factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas, as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the factories. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of Manchester, nicknamed "[[Cottonopolis]]", and the world's first industrial city.&lt;ref name="Industrial city"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page84.asp |title=Manchester – the first industrial city |publisher=Entry on Sciencemuseum website |accessdate=17 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309184810/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page84.asp |archivedate=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester experienced a six-times increase in its population between 1771 and 1831. Bradford grew by 50% every ten years between 1811 and 1851 and by 1851 only 50% of the population of Bradford was actually born there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/industrial_revolution_towns.htm|title=Life in Industrial Towns|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, between 1815 and 1939, 20 percent of Europe's population left home, pushed by poverty, a rapidly growing population, and the displacement of peasant farming and artisan manufacturing. They were pulled abroad by the enormous demand for labor overseas, the ready availability of land, and cheap transportation. Still, many did not find a satisfactory life in their new homes, leading 7 million of them to return to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultures in Contact|last=Hoeder|first=Dirk|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=331–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mass migration had large demographic impacts: in 1800, less than one percent of the world population consisted of overseas Europeans and their descendants; by 1930, they represented 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=America in the World|last=Guarneri|first=Carl|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americas felt the brunt of this huge emigration, largely concentrated in the United States.

For much of the 19th century, production was done in small mills, which were typically [[List of watermills in the United Kingdom|water-powered]] and built to serve local needs. Later, each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler.

In other industries, the transition to factory production was not so divisive. Some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers. One of the earliest such reformers was [[Robert Owen]], known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the [[Robert Owen#Philanthropy in New Lanark (1800)|New Lanark mills]], and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the [[Utopian socialism|early socialist movement]].

By 1746 an integrated [[brass mill]] was working at [[Warmley]] near [[Bristol]]. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]] (whose [[Soho Manufactory]] was completed in 1766) were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system.

====Child labour====
{{see also|Child labour#The Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:coaltub.png|right|frame|A young "drawer" pulling a coal tub along a mine gallery.&lt;ref name="From Coal Mine Upwards: or Seventy Years of an Eventful Life"/&gt; In Britain laws passed in 1842 and 1844 improved mine working conditions.]]

The Industrial Revolution led to a population increase but the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the Industrial Revolution, although ''infant'' mortality rates were reduced markedly.&lt;ref name="Buer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Demographic Transition and Industrial Revolution: A Macroeconomic Investigation"/&gt; There was still limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work. Employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable; there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine, and since the industrial system was completely new, there were no experienced adult labourers. This made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution between the 18th and 19th centuries. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered [[cotton mill]]s were described as children.&lt;ref name="galbithink"/&gt;

[[Child labour]] existed before the Industrial Revolution but with the increase in population and education it became more visible. Many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders,&lt;ref name="victorianweb"/&gt; 10–20% of an adult male's wage.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children as young as four were employed.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Beatings and long hours were common, with some child [[coal mine]]rs and [[hurrying|hurriers]] working from 4 am until 5 pm.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Conditions were dangerous, with some children killed when they dozed off and fell into the path of the carts, while others died from gas explosions.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Many children developed [[lung cancer]] and other diseases and died before the age of 25.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; [[Workhouses]] would sell orphans and abandoned children as "pauper apprentices", working without wages for board and lodging.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their masters, with some masters [[Shackle|shackling]] them to prevent escape.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children employed as [[mule scavenger]]s by [[cotton mill]]s would crawl under machinery to pick up cotton, working 14 hours a day, six days a week. Some lost hands or limbs, others were crushed under the machines, and some were decapitated.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Young girls worked at match factories, where phosphorus fumes would cause many to develop [[phossy jaw]].&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children employed at [[Glassblowing|glassworks]] were regularly burned and blinded, and those working at [[pottery|potteries]] were vulnerable to poisonous clay dust.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt;

Reports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal mines&lt;ref name="Testimony Gathered by Ashley's Mines Commission"/&gt; and textile factories,&lt;ref name="The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England"/&gt; and these helped to popularise the children's plight. The public outcry, especially among the upper and middle classes, helped stir change in the young workers' welfare.

Politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory owners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid [[starvation]], and others simply welcomed the cheap labour. In 1833 and 1844, the first general laws against child labour, the [[Factory Acts]], were passed in Britain: Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to work at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours. Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law, however, their scarcity made enforcement difficult.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; About ten years later, the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden. Although laws such as these decreased the number of child labourers, child labour remained significantly present in Europe and the United States until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="archives"/&gt;

====Organisation of labour====
{{See also|Trade union#History}}
The Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills, factories and mines, thus facilitating the organisation of ''combinations'' or [[trade union]]s to help advance the interests of working people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining.

The main method the unions used to effect change was [[strike action]]. Many strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. In Britain, the [[Combination Act 1799]] forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in 1824. Even after this, unions were still severely restricted. One British newspaper in 1834 described unions as "the most dangerous institutions that were ever permitted to take root, under shelter of law, in any country..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tolpuddle Martyrs|last=Evatt|first=Herbert|publisher=Sydney University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0586038321|location=Sydney|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832, the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] extended the vote in Britain but did not grant universal suffrage. That year six men from [[Tolpuddle]] in Dorset founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s. They refused to work for less than ten shillings a week, although by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to six. In 1834 James Frampton, a local landowner, wrote to the Prime Minister, [[Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], to complain about the union, invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other, which the members of the Friendly Society had done. James Brine, James Hammett, George Loveless, George's brother James Loveless, George's brother in-law Thomas Standfield, and Thomas's son John Standfield were arrested, found guilty, and transported to Australia. They became known as the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]]. In the 1830s and 1840s, the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement was the first large-scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. Its ''Charter'' of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration.

Working people also formed [[Friendly society|friendly societies]] and [[Cooperative|co-operative societies]] as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship. Enlightened industrialists, such as [[Robert Owen]] also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class.

Unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike. In 1842, a [[general strike]] involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the Chartist movement which stopped production across Great Britain.&lt;ref name="archive5"/&gt;

Eventually, effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who, after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, began to support socialist political parties that later merged to become the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

====Luddites====
{{Main|Luddite}}
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Luddites smashing a power loom in 1812]]

The rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs. The movement started first with [[lace]] and [[hosiery]] workers near [[Nottingham]] and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation. Many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers, and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of [[Ned Ludd]], a folklore figure. The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811. The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government took drastic measures, using the [[militia]] or [[army]] to protect industry. Those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged, or [[Penal transportation|transported]] for life.

Unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised, such as with agricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern Britain were affected by the [[Captain Swing]] disturbances. Threshing machines were a particular target, and [[hay]]rick burning was a popular activity. However, the riots led to the first formation of [[trade union]]s, and further pressure for reform.

====Shift in production's center of gravity====
The traditional centers of hand textile production such as India, parts of the Middle East and later China could not withstand the competition from machine-made textiles, which over a period of decades destroyed the hand made textile industries and left millions of people without work, many of whom starved.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

The Industrial Revolution also generated an enormous and unprecedented economic division in the world, as measured by the share of manufacturing output.

====Effect on cotton production and expansion of slavery====
Cheap cotton textiles increased the demand for raw cotton; previously, it had primarily been consumed in subtropical regions where it was grown, with little raw cotton available for export. Consequently, prices of raw cotton rose. Some cotton had been grown in the West Indies, particularly in [[Hispaniola]], but Haitian cotton production was halted by the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791. The invention of the cotton gin in 1792 allowed Georgia green seeded cotton to be profitable, leading to the widespread growth of cotton [[plantation]]s in the United States and Brazil. In 1791 world cotton production was estimated to be 490,000,000 pounds with U.S. production accounting to 2,000,000 pounds.  By 1800 U.S. production was 35,000,000 pounds, of which 17,790,000 were exported.  In 1945 the U.S. produced seven-eights of the 1,169,600,000 pounds of world production.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|150}}

The Americas, particularly the U.S., had labor shortages and high priced labor, which made [[slavery]] attractive.  America's cotton plantations were highly efficient and profitable, and able to keep up with demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert
|first= Sven|year= 2014|publisher =Vintage Books Division Penguin Random House |location=US|isbn= 978-0375-71396-5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. Civil war created a "cotton famine" that lead to increased production in other areas of the world, including new colonies in Africa.

===Impact on environment===
[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|Levels of air pollution rose during the Industrial Revolution, sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century.]]
The origins of the [[environmental movement]] lay in the response to increasing levels of [[smoke]] [[pollution]] in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in [[history of coal mining|coal consumption]] gave rise to an unprecedented level of [[air pollution]] in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial [[chemical]] discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.&lt;ref name="Donora"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ametsoc.org/sloan/cleanair/ |title=History of the Clean Air Act |accessdate=14 February 2006 |first=James R. |last=Fleming |author2=Bethany R. Knorr |publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's [[Alkali Acts]], passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution ([[gaseous]] [[hydrochloric acid]]) given off by the [[Leblanc process]], used to produce [[soda ash]]. An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted [[smoke]], grit, dust and fumes under supervision.

The manufactured gas industry began in British cities in 1812–1820. The technique used produced highly toxic effluent that was dumped into sewers and rivers. The gas companies were repeatedly sued in nuisance lawsuits. They usually lost and modified the worst practices. The City of London repeatedly indicted gas companies in the 1820s for polluting the Thames and poisoning its fish. Finally, Parliament wrote company charters to regulate toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie  Tomory, "The Environmental History of the Early British Gas Industry, 1812–1830." ''Environmental history'' 17#1 (2012): 29–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The industry reached the US around 1850 causing pollution and lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;Joel A. Tarr,  "Toxic Legacy: The Environmental Impact of the Manufactured Gas Industry in the United States." ''Technology and culture'' 55#1 (2014): 107–47. [http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&amp;context=history online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Harold L. Platt, ''Shock cities: the environmental transformation and reform of Manchester and Chicago'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Shock-Cities-Environmental-Transformation-Manchester/dp/0226670767/  excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in Britain in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash, and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Brian William Clapp, ''An environmental history of Britain since the industrial revolution'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrialisation beyond the United Kingdom==

===Continental Europe===
The Industrial Revolution on [[Continental Europe]] came a little later than in Great Britain. In many industries, this involved the application of technology developed in Britain in new places. Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities. By 1809, part of the [[Ruhr|Ruhr Valley]] in Westphalia was called 'Miniature England' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England. The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries. In some cases (such as [[Iron and steel industry|iron]]), the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the British technology were adopted.

====Belgium====

[[History of Belgium|Belgium]] was the second country, after Britain, in which the Industrial Revolution took place and the first in continental Europe: [[Wallonia]] (French speaking southern Belgium) was the first region to follow the British model successfully. Starting in the middle of the 1820s, and especially after Belgium became an independent nation in 1830, numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around [[Liège]] and [[Charleroi]]. The leader was a transplanted Englishman [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]]. His factories at [[Seraing]] integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.&lt;ref name="publishing"/&gt;

Wallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion. Thanks to coal (the French word "houille" was coined in Wallonia),&lt;ref name="language"/&gt; the region geared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after Britain. But it is also pointed out by many researchers, with its ''[[Sillon industriel]]'', 'Especially in the [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] valleys, between the [[Borinage]] and [[Liège]], [...] there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making...'.&lt;ref name="ugent"/&gt; Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: "It was not propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after Britain."&lt;ref name="philippe"/&gt; "The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth making town of [[Ghent]]."&lt;ref name="erih"/&gt; Michel De Coster, Professor at the [[University of Liège|Université de Liège]] wrote also: "The historians and the economists say that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and its territory [...] But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal-mines, the blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass industry, the weapons industry... were concentrated." &lt;ref name="linguistiques"/&gt;

=====Demographic effects=====
Wallonia was also the birthplace of a strong Socialist party and strong trade-unions in a particular sociological landscape. At the left, the ''Sillon industriel'', which runs from [[Mons]] in the west, to [[Verviers]] in the east (except part of North Flanders, in another period of the industrial revolution, after 1920). Even if Belgium is the second industrial country after Britain, the effect of the industrial revolution there was very different. In 'Breaking stereotypes', Muriel Neven and Isabelle Devious say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The industrial revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one, but with a strong contrast between northern and southern Belgium. During the [[Middle Ages]] and the Early Modern Period, Flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centres [...] at the beginning of the nineteenth century this region (Flanders), with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent, remained one of the most urbanised in the world. By comparison, this proportion reached only 17 per cent in Wallonia, barely 10 per cent in most West European countries, 16 per cent in France and 25 per cent in Britain. Nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure, except in [[Ghent]] [...] Also, in [[Wallonia]] the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process, even though the proportion of city-dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and 1910. Especially in the [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] valleys, between the [[Borinage]] and [[Liège]], where there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making, urbanisation was fast. During these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred, concentrating nearly half of the Walloon population in this region. Nevertheless, industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres, but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal-mine or a factory. Communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than, for instance, the area around Liège where the old town was there to direct migratory flows.&lt;ref name="stereotypes"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====France====
{{main|Economic history of France}}The industrial revolution in France followed a particular course as it did not correspond to the main model followed by other countries. Notably, most French historians argue France did not go through a clear ''take-off''.&lt;ref name="marczewski" /&gt; Instead, France's economic growth and industrialisation process was slow and steady through the 18th and 19th centuries. However, some stages were identified by Maurice Lévy-Leboyer:
* French Revolution and Napoleonic wars (1789–1815),
* industrialisation, along with Britain (1815–1860),
* economic slowdown (1860–1905),
* renewal of the growth after 1905.

====Germany====
{{main|Economic history of Germany}}

Based on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories, Germany, which was unified in 1871, became dominant in the world's chemical industry in the late 19th century. At first the production of dyes based on [[aniline]] was critical.&lt;ref name=Haber&gt;{{harvnb|Haber|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's political disunity – with three dozen states – and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines linked the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain's. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and pulled ahead of France&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mitchell, ''Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815–1914'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
{{Main|Economic history of Sweden}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}

During the period 1790–1815 Sweden experienced two parallel economic movements: an ''agricultural revolution'' with larger agricultural estates, new crops and farming tools and a commercialisation of farming, and a ''protoindustrialisation'', with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in summer and industrial production in winter. This led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a ''consumption revolution'' starting in the 1820s.

During 1815–1850 the protoindustries developed into more specialised and larger industries. This period witnessed increasing regional specialisation with mining in [[Bergslagen]], textile mills in Sjuhäradsbygden and forestry in [[Norrland]]. Several important institutional changes took place in this period, such as free and mandatory schooling introduced 1842 (as first country in the world), the abolition of the national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in 1846, and a stock company law in 1848.

During 1850–1890, Sweden experienced a veritable explosion in export, dominated by crops, wood and steel. Sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and joined the gold standard in 1873.

During 1890–1930, Sweden experienced the second industrial revolution. New industries developed with their focus on the domestic market: mechanical engineering, power utilities, [[papermaking]] and textile.

===Japan===
{{Main|Meiji Restoration|Economic history of Japan}}

The industrial revolution began about 1870 as [[Meiji period]] leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform programme to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan ([[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan]]).

In 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the [[Iwakura Mission]] toured Europe and the United States to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state-led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The [[Bank of Japan]], founded in 1882,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/outline/history/index.htm/|website=Bank of Japan|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories. Education was expanded and Japanese students were sent to study in the west.

Modern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Allen, ''Short Economic History of Modern Japan'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Important American technological contributions during the period of the Industrial Revolution were the [[cotton gin]] and the development of a system for making [[interchangeable parts]], the latter aided by the development of the [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] in the US.  The development of machine tools and the system of interchangeable parts were the basis for the rise of the US as the world's leading industrial nation in the late 19th century.

[[Oliver Evans]] invented an automated flour mill in the mid-1780s that used [[process control|control mechanisms]] and conveyors so that no labour was needed from the time grain was loaded into the elevator buckets until flour was discharged into a wagon.  This is considered to be the first modern [[Bulk material handling|materials handling system]] an important advance in the progress toward [[mass production]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

The United States originally used horse-powered machinery for small scale applications such as grain milling, but eventually switched to water power after textile factories began being built in the 1790s. As a result, industrialisation was concentrated in [[New England]] and the  [[Northeastern United States]], which has fast-moving rivers. The newer water-powered production lines proved more economical than horse-drawn production. In the late 19th century steam-powered manufacturing overtook water-powered manufacturing, allowing the industry to spread to the Midwest.

[[Thomas Somers]] and the [[Cabot Brothers]] founded the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]] in 1787, the first cotton mill in America, the largest cotton mill of its era,&lt;ref name="manufacturers"/&gt; and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills in the future. This mill was designed to use horse power, but the operators quickly learned that the horse-drawn platform was economically unstable, and had economic losses for years. Despite the losses, the Manufactory served as a playground of innovation, both in turning a large amount of cotton, but also developing the water-powered milling structure used in Slater's Mill.&lt;ref name="publication"/&gt;

In 1793, [[Samuel Slater]] (1768–1835) founded the [[Slater Mill]] at [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. He had learned of the new textile technologies as a boy apprentice in [[Derbyshire]], England, and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for New York in 1789, hoping to make money with his knowledge. After founding Slater's Mill, he went on to own 13 textile mills.&lt;ref name="britannica8"/&gt; [[Daniel Day (manufacturer)|Daniel Day]] established a wool carding mill in the [[Blackstone Valley]] at [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]] in 1809, the third woollen mill established in the US (The first was in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and the second at [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].) The [[John Chafee|John H. Chafee]] [[Blackstone Valley|Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor]] retraces the history of "America's Hardest-Working River', the Blackstone. The [[Blackstone River]] and its tributaries, which cover more than {{convert|45|mi|km}} from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] to [[Providence, Rhode Island]], was the birthplace of America's Industrial Revolution. At its peak over 1100 mills operated in this valley, including Slater's mill, and with it the earliest beginnings of America's Industrial and Technological Development.

[[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Merchant Francis Cabot Lowell]] from [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] memorised the design of textile machines on his tour of British factories in 1810. Realising that the [[War of 1812]] had ruined his import business but that a demand for domestic finished cloth was emerging in America, on his return to the United States, he set up the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]]. Lowell and his partners built America's second cotton-to-cloth textile mill at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], second to the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]]. After his death in 1817, his associates built America's first planned factory town, which they named after him. This enterprise was capitalised in a [[Initial public offering|public stock offering]], one of the first uses of it in the United States. [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], using {{convert|5.6|mi|km}} of canals and 10,000 horsepower delivered by the [[Merrimack River]], is considered by some as a major contributor to the success of the American Industrial Revolution. The short-lived utopia-like [[Waltham-Lowell system]] was formed, as a direct response to the poor working conditions in Britain. However, by 1850, especially following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]], the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour.

A major U.S. contribution to industrialization was the development of techniques to make [[interchangeable parts]] from metal.  Precision metal machining techniques were developed by the U.S. Department of War to make interchangeable parts for small firearms.  The development work took place at the Federal Arsenals at Springfield Armory and Harpers Ferry Armory.  Techniques for precision machining using machine tools included using fixtures to hold the parts in proper position, jigs to guide the cutting tools and precision blocks and gauges to measure the accuracy.  The [[milling machine]], a fundamental machine tool, is believed to have been invented by [[Eli Whitney]], who was a government contractor who built firearms as part of this program.  Another important invention was the Blanchard lathe, invented by [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]].

The industrialisation of the watch industry started 1854 also in Waltham, Massachusetts, at the [[Waltham Watch Company]], with the development of machine tools, gauges and assembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches.

==Second Industrial Revolution==
{{Main|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Hartmann Maschinenhalle 1868 (01).jpg|thumb|[[Sächsische Maschinenfabrik]] in [[Chemnitz]], Germany, 1868]]
&lt;!--The industries created by the original innovations of the Industrial Revolution were mature and their markets saturated by the late 1830s, resulting in an economic downturn at that time, followed by a long period of slow growth.--&gt;    
[[Steel]] is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass-production, which are said to characterise a "Second Industrial Revolution", beginning around 1850, although a method for mass manufacture of [[steel]] was not invented until the 1860s, when [[Henry Bessemer|Sir Henry Bessemer]] invented a new furnace which could convert molten [[pig iron]] into steel in large quantities. However, it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Men, Machines and Modern Times"/&gt;  Bessemer steel was being displaced by the [[open hearth furnace]] near the end of the 19th century.

This Second Industrial Revolution gradually grew to include chemicals, mainly the [[chemical industry|chemical industries]], [[petroleum]] (refining and distribution), and, in the 20th century, the [[automotive industry]], and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from Britain to the United States and Germany.

The increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation.

A new revolution began with electricity and [[electrification]] in the [[Electrical power industry|electrical industries]]. The introduction of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] generation in the [[Alps]] enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal-deprived northern Italy, beginning in the 1890s.

By the 1890s, industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests, as companies like [[U.S. Steel]], [[General Electric]], [[Standard Oil]] and [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] joined the railroad and ship companies on the world's [[stock market]]s.

==Causes==
[[File:Historic world GDP per capita.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|Regional [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita changed very little for most of human history before the Industrial Revolution.]]
The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate, with some historians believing the Industrial Revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of [[feudalism]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] after the [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.  The [[Enclosure]] movement and the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive, forcing the farmers who could no longer be self-sufficient in agriculture into [[cottage industry]], for example [[weaving]], and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed [[factory|factories]].&lt;ref name="The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England"/&gt; The [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of [[financial market]]s and accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] are also cited as factors, as is the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;   A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=13–16|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1980s, it was universally believed by academic historians that technological innovation was the heart of the Industrial Revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine.&lt;ref name="industrial10"/&gt; However, recent research into the Marketing Era has challenged the traditional, supply-oriented interpretation of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="association"/&gt;

[[Lewis Mumford]] has proposed that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the [[Early Middle Ages]], much earlier than most estimates.&lt;ref name="Technics &amp; Civilization"/&gt; He explains that the model for standardised [[mass production]] was the [[printing press]] and that "the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock". He also cites the [[Monasticism|monastic]] emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that [[medieval]] cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later, more physical, manifestations such as the steam engine.

The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain. In other nations, such as France, markets were split up by local regions, which often imposed tolls and [[tariff]]s on goods traded among them.&lt;ref name="google11"/&gt; Internal tariffs were abolished by [[Henry VIII of England]], they survived in Russia until 1753, 1789 in France and 1839 in Spain.

Governments' grant of limited [[monopoly|monopolies]] to inventors under a developing [[patent]] system (the [[Statute of Monopolies]] in 1623) is considered an influential factor. The effects of patents, both good and ill, on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine, the key enabling technology. In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as James Watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines, thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. However, monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors.&lt;ref name="industrialisation"/&gt; Watt's monopoly prevented other inventors, such as [[Richard Trevithick]], [[William Murdoch]],  or [[Jonathan Hornblower]], whom Boulton and Watt sued, from introducing improved steam engines, thereby retarding the spread of steam power.&lt;ref name="dklevine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mott-smith"/&gt;

One question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century, particularly China, [[Indian subcontinent|India]], and the Middle East (which pioneered in shipbuilding, textile production, water mills, and much more in the period between 750 and 1100&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lever of Riches: Technological Creativity and Economic Progress|last=Mokyr|first=Joel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0195074772|location=New York|pages=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or at other times like in [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]]&lt;ref name="j-bradford-delong"/&gt; or the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="historyguide"/&gt; A recent account argued that Europeans have been characterized for thousands of years by a freedom-loving culture originating from the aristocratic societies of early Indo-European invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Uniqueness of Western Civilization|last=Duchesne|first=Ricardo|publisher=Brill|year=2011|isbn=978-9004232761|location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians, however, have challenged this explanation as being not only Eurocentric, but also ignoring historical context. In fact, before the Industrial Revolution, "there existed something of a global economic parity between the most advanced regions in the world economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vries|first=Pier|date=2001|title=Are Coal and Colonies Really Crucial?|url=|journal=Journal of World History|volume=2|pages=411|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These historians have suggested a number of other factors, including education, technological changes&lt;ref name="google12"/&gt; (see [[scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]] in Europe), "modern" government, "modern" work attitudes, ecology, and culture.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution – Causes"/&gt;

China was the world's most technologically advanced country for many centuries; however, China stagnated economically and technologically and was surpassed by Western Europe before the Age of Exploration, by which time China banned imports and denied entry to foreigners. China was also a totalitarian society.&lt;ref&gt;

Historians such as [[David Landes]] and [[Max Weber]] credit the different belief systems in Asia and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|pages=20–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The religion and beliefs of Europe were largely products of [[Judeo-Christian|Judaeo-Christianity]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] thought. Conversely, Chinese society was founded on men like [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], [[Han Fei]]zi ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]), [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]] ([[Taoism]]), and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] ([[Buddhism]]), resulting in very different worldviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Merson|1990|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors include the considerable distance of China's coal deposits, though large, from its cities as well as the then unnavigable [[Yellow River]] that connects these deposits to the sea.&lt;ref name="professor"/&gt;

Regarding India, the Marxist historian [[Rajani Palme Dutt]] said: "The capital to finance the Industrial Revolution in India instead went into financing the Industrial Revolution in Britain."&lt;ref name="india_resource"/&gt; In contrast to China, India was split up into many competing kingdoms after the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], with the major ones in its aftermath including the [[Maratha]]s, [[Sikh]]s, [[Bengal Subah]], and [[Kingdom of Mysore]]. In addition, the economy was highly dependent on two sectors – agriculture of subsistence and cotton, and there appears to have been little technical innovation. It is believed that the vast amounts of wealth were largely stored away in palace treasuries by totalitarian monarchs prior to the British take over.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Economic historian [[Joel Mokyr]] has argued that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China and India by providing "an insurance against economic and technological stagnation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia|last=Jones|first=Eric|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1981|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; China had both a printing press and movable type, and India had similar levels scientific and technological achievement as Europe in 1700, yet the Industrial Revolution would occur in Europe, not China or India. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an "integrated market for ideas" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin, had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the [[Republic of Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.

In addition, Europe's monarchs desperately needed revenue, pushing them into alliances with their merchant classes. Small groups of merchants were granted monopolies and tax-collecting responsibilities in exchange for payments to the state.

===Causes in Britain===
[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|upright=1.35|thumb|As the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged ahead of other economies.]]

Great Britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled [[entrepreneur]]s to pioneer the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, "The Nation, the State, and the First Industrial Revolution," ''Journal of British Studies'' (April 2011) 50#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;307–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Key factors fostering this environment were: (1) The period of peace and stability which followed the unification of England and Scotland; (2) no trade barriers between England and Scotland; (3) the rule of law (enforcing property rights and respecting the sanctity of contracts); (4) a straightforward legal system that allowed the formation of joint-stock companies (corporations); (5) absence of tolls, which had largely disappeared from Britain by the 15th century, but were an extreme burden on goods elsewhere in the world, and (6) a free market (capitalism).&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;
{{Quote box|width=24%|align=left|quote="An unprecedented explosion of new ideas, and new technological inventions, transformed our use of energy, creating an increasingly industrial and urbanised country. Roads, railways and canals were built. Great cities appeared. Scores of factories and mills sprang up. Our landscape would never be the same again. It was a revolution that transformed not only the country, but the world itself." |source = – British historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] on the BBC's ''Why the Industrial Revolution Happened Here''.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the Industrial Revolution Happened Here|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pz9d6|publisher=BBC|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Geographical and natural resource advantages of Great Britain were the fact that it had extensive coastlines and many navigable rivers in an age where water was the easiest means of transportation and having the highest quality coal in Europe.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|332}}

There were two main values that really drove the Industrial Revolution in Britain. These values were self-interest and an [[entrepreneurial]] spirit. Because of these interests, many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth and a [[consumer]] revolution.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt; These advancements also greatly benefitted the British society as a whole. Countries around the world started to recognise the changes and advancements in Britain and use them as an example to begin their own Industrial Revolutions.&lt;ref name="Kiely"&gt;Kiely, Ray (November 2011). "Industrialization and Development: A Comparative Analysis". UGL Press Limited: 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the massive lead that Great Britain had over other countries. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas [[British Empire#Colonization|colonies]] or that profits from the British [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. However, it has been pointed out that slave trade and West Indian plantations provided only 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="Was slavery the engine of economic growth? Digital History"/&gt; Even though slavery accounted for so little, Caribbean-based demand accounted for 12% of Britain's industrial output.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution by Pat Hudson, pg. 198"/&gt;
[[File:William Bell Scott - Iron and Coal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[William Bell Scott]] ''Iron and Coal'', 1855–60]]

Instead, the greater [[liberalisation]] of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies, particularly China and Russia. Britain emerged from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the [[Royal Navy]]&lt;ref name="manufacturing"/&gt;). Britain's extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain's geographical position – an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe.

Another theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed. It had a dense population for its small geographical size. [[Enclosure]] of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a supply of this labour readily available. There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the [[Northern England|North of England]], the [[English Midlands]], [[South Wales]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands]]. Local supplies of coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power, resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. Also, the damp, mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry.

The stable political situation in Britain from around 1688 following the [[Glorious Revolution]], and British society's greater receptiveness to change (compared with other European countries) can also be said to be factors favouring the Industrial Revolution. Peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by the Enclosure movement, and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="dictatorship"/&gt; (This point is also made in [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s ''[[The Servile State]]''.)

The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] wrote about capitalism and religious tolerance in his book on English society, ''[[Letters on the English]]'' (1733), noting why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. "Take a view of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange in London]], a place more venerable than many courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Mahometan [Muslim], and the Christian transact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker's word. If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another's throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/6.html|title=Letter VI – On the Presbyterians. Letters on the English.|last=Voltaire|first=François Marie Arouet de.|date=1909–14|website=www.bartleby.com|publisher=The Harvard Classics|page=|orig-year=1734|access-date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's population grew 280% 1550–1820, while the rest of Western Europe grew 50–80%. Seventy percent of European urbanisation happened in Britain 1750–1800. By 1800, only the Netherlands was more urbanised than Britain. This was only possible because coal, coke, imported cotton, brick and slate had replaced wood, charcoal, flax, peat and thatch. The latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not. Yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horse's work was mechanised. A workhorse needs {{convert|3|to|5|acres|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} for fodder while even early steam engines produced four times more mechanical energy.

In 1700, 5/6 of coal mined worldwide was in Britain, while the Netherlands had none; so despite having Europe's best transport, most urbanised, well paid, literate people and lowest taxes, it failed to industrialise. In the 18th century, it was the only European country whose cities and population shrank. Without coal, Britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by the 1830s.&lt;ref name="continuity"/&gt;

Economic historian [[Robert C. Allen|Robert Allen]] has argued that high wages, cheap capital and very cheap energy in Britain made it the ideal place for the industrial revolution to occur.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crafts|first=Nicholas|date=2011-04-01|title=Explaining the first Industrial Revolution: two views|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/15/1/153/512087/Explaining-the-first-Industrial-Revolution-two|journal=European Review of Economic History|volume=15|issue=1|pages=153–168|doi=10.1017/S1361491610000201|issn=1361-4916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors made it vastly more profitable to invest in research and development, and to put technology to use in Britain than other societies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, two 2018 studies in ''[[The Economic History Review]]'' showed that wages were not particularly high in the British [[Spinning wheel|spinning]] sector or the construction sector, casting doubt on Allen's explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphries|first=Jane|last2=Schneider|first2=Benjamin|date=2018-05-23|title=Spinning the industrial revolution|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|doi=10.1111/ehr.12693|issn=0013-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Judy Z.|date=2017-05-13|title='Real' wages?

===Transfer of knowledge===
[[File:Wright of Derby, The Orrery.jpg|thumb|[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]] (ca. 1766). Informal philosophical societies spread scientific advances]]
Knowledge of innovation was spread by several means. Workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached. A common method was for someone to make a study tour, gathering information where he could. During the whole of the Industrial Revolution and for the century before, all European countries and America engaged in study-touring; some nations, like Sweden and France, even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy. In other countries, notably Britain and America, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods. Study tours were common then, as now, as was the keeping of travel diaries. Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods.

Another means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies, like the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], in which members met to discuss 'natural philosophy' (''i.e.'' science) and often its application to manufacturing. The Lunar Society flourished from 1765 to 1809, and it has been said of them, "They were, if you like, the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions, the Industrial Revolution".&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt; Other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions. For example, the London-based [[Royal Society of Arts]] published an illustrated volume of new inventions, as well as papers about them in its annual ''Transactions''.

There were publications describing technology. [[Encyclopedia|Encyclopaedias]] such as [[John Harris (writer)|Harris]]'s ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' (1704) and [[Abraham Rees]]'s ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1802–1819) contain much of value. ''Cyclopaedia'' contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the Industrial Revolution, very well illustrated by fine engravings. Foreign printed sources such as the ''[[Descriptions des Arts et Métiers]]'' and Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates.

Periodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century, and many regularly included notice of the latest patents. Foreign periodicals, such as the ''Annales des Mines'', published accounts of travels made by French engineers who observed British methods on study tours.

====Protestant work ethic====
{{Main|Protestant work ethic}}
Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an [[entrepreneur]]ial class which believed in progress, technology and hard work.&lt;ref name="Capital and Innovation: How Britain Became the First Industrial Nation"/&gt; The existence of this class is often linked to the [[Protestant work ethic]] (see [[Max Weber]]) and the particular status of the [[Baptists]] and the dissenting Protestant sects, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] that had flourished with the [[English Civil War]]. Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the [[Government debt|national debt]] by the [[Bank of England]], contributed to the capacity for, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures.

[[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at England's [[Oxbridge|only two universities]] at the time (although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|four universities]]). When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]] became mandatory due to the [[Test Act]], they thereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. The [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], in particular, were very involved in education, by running Dissenting Academies, where, in contrast to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow, much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences – areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies.

Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies involved. While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the [[middle class]], such as traditional financiers or other businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the 17th century.

==Opposition from Romanticism==
{{Main|Romanticism}}
During the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed, associated with the Romantic movement.  Romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled against the upheavals caused by industrialization, urbanization and the wretchedness of the working classes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre, eds., ''Romanticism against the Tide of Modernity'' (Duke University Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Its major exponents in English included the artist and poet [[William Blake]] and poets [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[John Keats]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. The movement stressed the importance of "nature" in art and language, in contrast to "monstrous" machines and factories; the "Dark satanic mills" of Blake's poem "[[And did those feet in ancient time]]". [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' reflected concerns that scientific progress might be two-edged. French Romanticism likewise was highly critical of industry.&lt;ref&gt;AJ George, ''The development of French romanticism: the impact of the industrial revolution on literature'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="manufacturing"&gt;The Royal Navy itself may have contributed to Britain's industrial growth. Among the first complex industrial manufacturing processes to arise in Britain were those that produced material for British warships. For instance, the average warship of the period used roughly 1000 pulley fittings. With a fleet as large as the Royal Navy, and with these fittings needing to be replaced every 4 to 5 years, this created a great demand which encouraged industrial expansion. The industrial manufacture of rope can also be seen as a similar factor.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is organised by a host institution and vary for each year. ICYS is a member of [http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/wfphc/  World Federation of Physics Competitions].

==History==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
In 1993 the representatives of Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest and the State University of Belarus, Minsk decided to organize together a conference for 14- to 18-year-old secondary school students. The aim of the organizers with organizing such a new type of a competition was to acquaint secondary school students with the methods of scientific research. This includes different phases of research work from the very beginning the pointing out the topic to the last step, summing up the results of the research in a foreign language-lecture. The conference gives the challenging opportunity to the young scientists to get some feedback of the work with which they are just trying to deal, and to measure their strength in an international field.
During the years students from the following countries have participated in the Conference: Belarus, Czech Republic, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, The Netherlands, Ukraine, United States of America, Yugoslavia.
The conference in Hungary (Visegrad, 1994, 1996, 1998), in Belarus (Baranovichi, 1995, 1997, 1999), in 2000 in The Netherlands, in Nijmegen, in 2001 in Poland, in Katowice, in 2002 in Georgia, in Kutaisi was organized respectively, in 2003 will be held in Czech Republic, in Prague.
The first ICYS was in Visegrad in 1994. Then 70 lectures were presented by students from 5 countries. Hungarian organizers always come back to Visegrad, the competition become widely known as "Visegrad Conference".
In 1996 the number of participants increased, 86 lecturers from 9 countries gave their lectures. The Conference every year becomes richer, new countries join to the competition. The Conference has a good reputation not only in the Middle European countries, but outside Europe too. This year we have an observer from Singapore, a country where the education receives from the government the highest financial support all over the world. This year we have more than 80 secondary school participants, and more than 70 lectures with wide variety of topics. We are convinced, that nowadays, during the permanently decreasing popularity of sciences a scientific event which attracts the young generation has special significance. Perhaps most of the participating students will later become students at various universities and will be researchers reporting at scientific conferences. This first appearance may be a decisive factor in their future scientific career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.izmir.edu.tr/icys2015/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Ayscough''' (died 1759) was an English [[optician]] and designer and maker of [[scientific instruments]]. He was apprenticed to an optician named [[James Mann (optician)|James Mann]] from 1743 to 1747. James Ayscough became known for his [[microscope]]s. His shop was in [[London]] between 1740 and 1759. Around the year 1752, James Ayscough introduced [[spectacles]] with double-hinged side pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Washizu | first =Hiroko  | title =The Optics of Green Spectacles | journal =The Edgar Allan Poe Review | volume =12 | issue =2 | page =49 | publisher = Penn State University Press | date =2011 | jstor =41506455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he made clear [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], he recommended lenses tinted blue or green to treat some vision problems.  These [[spectacles]] with tinted lenses are believed to be the precursors to [[sunglasses]].

'''John Anthony Powers''' (August 22, 1922 &amp;ndash; December 31, 1979), better known as '''Shorty Powers''', was an American public affairs officer for [[NASA]] from 1959 to 1963 during [[Project Mercury]]. A [[U.S. Air Force]] [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and war veteran, he was known as the "voice of the astronauts," the "voice of [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mercury Control]]," and the "[[Mercury Seven|eighth astronaut]]." He received his nickname for his 5-foot, 6-inch (1.68 m) height.

==Biography==

Powers was born August 22, 1922, to first generation [[Welsh American|Welsh]] immigrant parents in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. Powers father's last name was actually Power, however, upon signing the immigration documents, Power became Powers. When Powers was an infant his family moved to [[Downers Grove, Illinois]]&lt;ref name=tol-blade-peace&gt;{{cite news |title=Shorty Powers Preaches Peace |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19700512&amp;id=tggkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vQEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7252,1796691&amp;hl=en |accessdate=June 28, 2015 |work=The Toledo Blade |date= May 12, 1970 |page=52 |volume=Vol. 135 |via=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was a cheerleader at [[Downers Grove North High School]], from which he graduated in 1941. After graduation, he enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] in 1942 and became a [[Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando|C-46]] and [[C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] pilot with the [[349th Operations Group|349th Troop Carrier Group]]. He was one of six pilots who volunteered to learn the technique of snatching fully loaded [[Waco CG-4|troop gliders]] off the ground, and spent the end of [[World War II]] ferrying gasoline in cargo planes to Gen. George Patton's command in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="time19620302"/&gt;

Powers left the service in January 1947; but was recalled to active duty in December 1948 and flew as part of the [[Berlin Airlift]], making 185 round-trip flights. He later volunteered for the [[Korean War]]. He flew 55 night missions in [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26]] bombers with the [[13th Bomb Squadron|13th Bombardment Squadron]] and received the [[Bronze Star Medal]], the [[Air Medal]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and a combat promotion to [[Major]].&lt;ref name="time19620302"/&gt;

Following Korea, Powers bounced around the Air Force, helping establish the first Community Relations Program in 1955. After being assigned to the personal staff of [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Bernard Schriever]] with the Air Research Development Command in [[Los Angeles]], he handled the public dissemination of information related to the Air Force's ballistic missile program.

===Project Mercury===

[[File:Glenn, Powers, Shepard.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Powers sits between Mercury astronauts [[John Glenn]] (left) and [[Alan Shepard]] at a 1961 news conference at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]]]]Powers' experience with [[public affairs industry|public affairs]] caught the attention of the newly formed NASA, and he was detailed to NASA's [[Space Task Group]] in April 1959 as its public affairs officer at the request of [[T. Keith Glennan]], NASA's first administrator.&lt;ref name=dark-side&gt;DeGroot, Gerard J. ''Dark Side of the Moon: the Magnificent Madness of the American Lunar Quest'', New York University Press (2006), p. 96. {{ISBN|9780814721131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very early on April 12, 1961, John G. Warner, a [[United Press International|UPI]] rewrite-man in [[Washington, D.C.]], roused Powers from sleep at [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]] seeking comment on [[Vostok 1|the flight]] of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]], the first person in space. Powers replied, in part, "We're all asleep down here," which made headlines.&lt;ref name="time19620302"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939891,00.html |title=Calm Voice from Space |date=March 2, 1962 |work=[[TIME]] |accessdate=June 28, 2015 |publisher=Time Inc. |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as mission commentator for the six manned [[Mercury flights]], introducing "[[A-OK]]" into the American vocabulary to signify procedures during the missions had proceeded as planned. He claimed astronaut [[Alan Shepard]] first used the expression during his ''[[Freedom 7]]'' flight, but communication transcripts later showed he had not.&lt;ref name=nasa-hstry-SP-4201&gt;{{cite web |last1=Swenson|first1=Loyd S. Jr. |last2=Grimwood|first2=James M. |last3=Alexander|first3=Charles C. |title=This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury, ''Chap. 10:'' 'Ham Paves the Way' |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source37 |website=Footnote 37 |publisher=[[NASA]] (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) |accessdate=June 22, 2015 |date=1989 |quote=''In reporting the Freedom 7 flight, the press attributed the term to Astronaut Shepard, ...

Clements of the Air Force had used "A.OK" frequently in reports written more than four months before the Shepard flight. ...  Be that as it may, Powers, "the voice of Mercury Control," by his public use of "A.OK," made those three letters a universal symbol meaning "in perfect working order."  ''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]]'', [[Tom Wolfe]] wrote that Powers had borrowed it "from NASA engineers who used it during radio transmission tests because the sharper sound of ''A'' cut through the static better than ''O''".&lt;ref name=right-stuff-79-p215&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wolfe |first1=Tom |authorlink=Tom Wolfe |title=The Right Stuff |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |date=July 1, 1979 |page= 215 |location= |isbn=9780374250324 |edition= |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=vRSArgEACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn%3A0374250324&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions |accessdate=June 28, 2015 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powers enjoyed the limelight, and was accused of scheduling news conferences so he could appear live on national television and occasionally twisting the facts. For example, he told reporters the day before [[Gus Grissom]]'s flight that the astronaut had gone fishing that day and had cooked and eaten his catch, which would have violated his pre-flight diet.&lt;ref name=obser-rprtr-dead/&gt;

[[Manned Spacecraft Center]] Director [[Robert Gilruth]] announced Powers' reassignment on July 26, 1963, reportedly following a dispute with [[NASA Headquarters]] over handling publicity for [[Mercury-Atlas 9|the final Mercury flight]].&lt;ref name=st-pete-time-death/&gt; Powers objected to the HQ decision to release the mission's 22-orbit flight plan in advance.&lt;ref name=dbm-journal-nojob&gt;{{cite news |title=Shorty Powers Losing Job |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19630726&amp;id=x3seAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OsoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=885,4340531&amp;hl=en |accessdate=June 28, 2015 |work=[[Daytona Beach Morning Journal]] |agency=UP |date=July 27, 1963 |page=5 |volume=Vol. XXXVIII |number=No. 178 |via=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Paul Haney on September 1, and Powers soon resigned.

===Later years===

Powers retired from the Air Force in 1964 and opened a public relations firm in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. He became part owner of [[KMJQ|KMSC-FM]] in [[Clear Lake, Texas]] (the call letters standing for the Manned Spacecraft Center), where he anchored live coverage of [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] flights, distributed to radio stations across the country. He also served a spokesman for products including the 1965 [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]] (touting its "Super Rocket V-8" engine), [[Carrier Corporation|Carrier]] air conditioners, Triptone motion sickness pills, and [[Tareyton]] cigarettes (which claimed to use the same charcoal-activated filter used for the astronauts' oxygen supply).&lt;ref name=schenect-gaz-critics&gt;{{cite news |last1=McGarry|first1=Greg |title=Powers Rejects Space Critics Opposed to Manned Flights |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19701008&amp;id=x2gtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9IkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=722,2111952&amp;hl=en |accessdate=June 28, 2015 |work=[[Schenectady Gazette]] |date =October 8, 1970 |page=49 |via=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lectured extensively about the space program, and served as emcee at the dedication of the [[Clear Lake (region)|Clear Lake]] Theatre Time Capsule on April 20, 1966. In 1967, he authored a newspaper column syndicated nationally by [[Field Enterprises]] called "Space Talk", answering readers' questions.

Powers was married three times and was the father of three children.&lt;ref name=obser-rprtr-dead&gt;{{cite news |last1=Benedict |first1=Howard  |title=Voice of the Astronauts' Shorty Powers Dead |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19800103&amp;id=F_NdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Zl8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=912,388545&amp;hl=en |accessdate=June 28, 2015 |work=[[Observer–Reporter]] |agency=The Associated Press |date= January 3, 1980 |page=D-3 |issue=Vol. 172, No. 80002 |via=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Sara Kay McSherry, women's editor of the ''[[Indianapolis News]]'', on August 7, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;AP wirephoto June 22, 1965 {{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powers moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1978, and died there at his home on December 31, 1979 at age 57 from a [[gastrointestinal hemorrhage]] related to chronic [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name=st-pete-time-death&gt;{{cite news |title='Shorty' Powers, 'voice of the astronauts,' is found dead at 57 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19800102&amp;id=3-RaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=enwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2740,1295184&amp;hl=en |accessdate=June 28, 2015 |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |issue=Vol. 198, No. 63 |date=January 3, 1980 |pages=1 &amp;16A |via=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and TV==

Powers appeared as himself in the 1963 episode entitled "Junior Astronaut" of [[CBS]]'s sitcom, ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', starring [[Jay North]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0557950/|title="Dennis and the Astronaut", January 13, 1963|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the narrator for the 1966 [[Jerry Lewis]] space comedy, ''[[Way...Way Out]]''.

He is referenced in the 1988 cult film, ''[[Miracle Mile (film)|Miracle Mile]]'', by actor [[Kurt Fuller]] when, as Soviet warheads appear over Los Angeles, he states, "Talk me down, Shorty Powers".

'''Kirklington Hall Research Station''' was a [[Exploration geophysics|geophysical]] research institute of [[BP]] in [[Kirklington, Nottinghamshire]].

==History==
As part of the [[East Midlands Oil Province]], oil was found in eastern Nottinghamshire. It was also known as the '''BP Research Centre''' or the Geophysical Centre, part of BP's Exploration Division. The research centre was established in 1950. Its first employee was [[Jack Birks]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1338608/Jack-Birks.html Jack Birks]&lt;/ref&gt; later Managing Director of BP. From 1950 it was the main research site of BP, until BP sold the site in 1957 for £12,000. Research moved to [[Sunbury-on-Thames]], in [[Surrey]], in 1957. Sunbury had been built around the same time as the Kirklington site, in the early 1950s.

Kirklington Hall today is a private school.

==Structure==
The former site is situated north of the [[A617 road|A617]].

==Function==
It conducted [[Geophysics|geophysical]] research for [[Hydrocarbon exploration|exploration]] for BP. This part of BP is now known as [[BP Exploration]]. Work would be conducted on [[core sample]]s and with [[Reflection seismology|seismic methods]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2933">The '''laser star hypothesis''' is a [[hypothesis]] put forward by the physicist [[Y. P. Varshni]] in 1973 in response to several developments in astrophysical and earth-based research, and his belief that the existing body of work on [[quasar]]s, or "quasi stellar objects," suffered fundamental difficulties.  It states that quasars are hot stars with strong stellar winds which are producing natural [[laser|las]]ing. This model is contradicted by the current [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] [[scientific community|science community]] understanding that quasars are distant [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]].

[[File:ExampleUpdatedHistogramOfTNOsemimajoraxii.png|thumb|Graph showing the numbers of KBOs for a given distance from the Sun. The plutinos are the "spike" at 39 AU, whereas the classicals are between 42 and 47 AU, the twotinos are at 48 AU, and the 5:2 resonance is at 55 AU. Note this lists [[semi-major axis]] distances, not current distance from the Sun (see [[Kuiper cliff]])]]

These [[Solar System]] objects were the furthest away from the [[Sun]] as of December 2015. The objects have been categorized by their approximate heliocentric distance from the Sun, not by the greatest calculated [[Perihelion and aphelion|aphelion]] in their orbit. 

This list does not mention objects that were discovered, but not announced, by 2015. An example would be [[2015 TH367]], which was discovered in October 2015 but not announced until 2018.

The list changes over time because the objects are moving. Some objects are inbound and some are outbound. It would be difficult to detect long-distance comets if it weren't for their [[Coma (cometary)|comas]], which become visible when heated by the Sun.

Distances are measured in [[Astronomical unit|astronomical units]] (AU, Sun–Earth distances). The distances are not the minimum ([[perihelion]]) or the maximum ([[aphelion]]) that may be achieved by these objects in the future.

== Notable objects ==
The discovery of an object known as [[V774104]] was announced in November 2015 and was heralded by many news outlets as "the most distant Solar System object", surpassing Eris by close to 7 AU (not counting space probes and long-period comets). There is some confusion regarding its distance as of 2018, as V774104 might now be suspected of being closer than Eris,&lt;ref name="Sheppard update"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/v774104-most-distant-solar-system-object-11212015/#comment-124767|title=V774104 update|last=Beatty|first=Kelly|date=29 January 2018|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is due to a misunderstanding (which arose because [[Scott S. Sheppard|Scott Sheppard]] was referring to an unannounced [[Sednoid]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/astrokiwi/status/979280852835291136 Astronomer Michele Bannister] (29 Mar 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another very distant body is Sedna, which was discovered in November 2003. Although it takes over 10,000 years to orbit, during the next 60 years it will slowly move closer to the Sun as it comes to [[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2004/mar/HQ_04091_sedna_discovered.html Most Distant Object In Solar System Discovered]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Morrison Formation''' is a distinctive sequence of Late [[Jurassic]] [[sedimentary rock]] that is found in the western United States, which has been the most fertile source of [[dinosaur]] fossils in [[North America]]. It is composed of [[mudstone]], [[sandstone]], [[siltstone]] and [[limestone]] and is light grey, greenish gray, or red. Most of the [[fossil]]s occur in the green siltstone beds and lower sandstones, relics of the rivers and floodplains of the [[Jurassic]] period.

==Fauna comparisons==
The fauna of Morrison Formation is similar to one in the coeval rocks of [[Tendaguru Formation|Tendaguru Beds]] (in Tanzania) and [[Lourinhã Formation]] in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, O.  2006.  Late Jurassic dinosaurs from the Morrison Formation, the Lourinhã and Alcobaça Formations (Portugal), and the Tendaguru Beds (Tanzania): a comparison. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin. 36:223-231.&lt;/ref&gt; mostly with the second. Some genera are shared in Morrison and Lourinhã, such as ''[[Torvosaurus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickx, C, Mateus O.  2014.  Torvosaurus gurneyi n. sp., the largest terrestrial predator from Europe, and a proposed terminology of the maxilla anatomy in nonavian theropods, 03. PLoS ONE. 9:e88905., Number 3&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, O., &amp; Antunes M. T. (2000).  Ceratosaurus sp. (Dinosauria: Theropoda) in the Late Jurassic of Portugal. Abstract volume of the 31st International Geological Congress. , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', ''[[Dryosaurus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, O. (2007).  Notes and review of the ornithischian dinosaurs of Portugal. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 27, 114A-114A., Jan: Society of Vertebrate Paleontology&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Allosaurus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, O, Walen A, Antunes MT.  2006.  The large theropod fauna of the Lourinhã Formation (Portugal) and its similarity to the Morrison Formation, with a description of a new species of Allosaurus. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin. 36:123-129.&lt;/ref&gt;
In sum, Morrison Fm has 37 valid genera of dinosaurs.

==Ornithischians==
The herbivorous [[ornithischian]] dinosaurs were diverse but not as common as sauropods in the Morrison. ''[[Fruitadens]]'', previously known as the "Fruita ''[[Echinodon]]''", was found to be a [[heterodontosauridae|heterodontosaurid]]. Plate-backed [[Stegosauridae|stegosaurids]] included ''[[Hesperosaurus|Hesperosaurus mjosi]]'', ''[[Stegosaurus|Stegosaurus armatus]]'', ''S. ungulatus'', ''S. stenops'', and ''[[Alcovasaurus|Alcovasaurus longispinus]]''.  [[Ankylosauria|Armored dinosaurs]] that weren't stegosaurs were unknown in the formation until the 1990s.  Two have been named: ''[[Gargoyleosaurus|Gargoyleosaurus parkpinorum]]'' and ''[[Mymoorapelta|Mymoorapelta maysi]]''.  [[Ornithopoda|Ornithopods]], bipedal herbivores, came in several types. Small "[[Hypsilophodontidae|hypsilophodonts]]" included ''[[Drinker nisti]]'', ''[[Laosaurus celer]]'', "L." ''gracilis'', ''[[Nanosaurus|Nanosaurus agilis]]'', ''[[Othnielia|Othnielia rex]]'', and ''[[Othnielosaurus|Othnielosaurus consors]]''.  Larger but similar-looking [[Dryosauridae|dryosaurids]] were represented by ''[[Dryosaurus|Dryosaurus altus]]'' and the camptosaurid ''[[Uteodon|Uteodon aphanoecetes]]'', which is currently known only from Dinosaur National Monument. Still larger was the more common ''[[Camptosaurus|Camptosaurus dispar]]''.  Dryosaurids and [[Camptosauridae|camptosaurids]] were early [[iguanodont]]s, a group that would later spawn the [[hadrosaur|duck-billed dinosaurs]].

==Sauropods==
[[Sauropoda|Sauropods]], the giant long-necked long-tailed four-legged [[herbivorous]] dinosaurs, are among the most common and famous Morrison fossils. A few have uncertain relationships, like [[Apatosaurus|"Apatosaurus" ''minimus'']] (possibly a basal titanosauriform) and ''[[Haplocanthosaurus]]''. Sauropods including ''[[Haplocanthosaurus|Haplocanthosaurus priscus]]'', ''H. delfsi'', and the [[Diplodocidae|diplodocid]] ''[[Brontosaurus|Eobrontosaurus]]'' appeared in the early stages of the Morrison. The middle stages were dominated by familiar forms such as the [[Giraffe]]-like ''[[Brachiosaurus|Brachiosaurus altithorax]]'', which were uncommon, but related [[Camarasauridae|camarasaurids]], like ''[[Camarasaurus|Camarasaurus supremus]]'', ''C. grandis'', ''C. lentus'', and ''[[Cathetosaurus]]'', were very common. Also common were long, low [[Diplodocidae|diplodocids]], like ''[[Apatosaurus|Apatosaurus ajax]]'', ''A. louisae'', ''[[Brontosaurus|Brontosaurus excelsus]]'', ''B. parvus'', ''[[Barosaurus|Barosaurus lentus]]'', ''[[Diplodocus|Diplodocus longus]]'', ''D. carnegii'', ''[[Galeamopus]]'' and ''[[Dyslocosaurus|Dyslocosaurus polyonychius]]''.

By the late Morrison, gigantic diplodocids (or likely diplodocids) had appeared, including ''Diplodocus hallorum'' (formerly ''Seismosaurus''), ''[[Supersaurus|Supersaurus vivianae]]'', ''[[Amphicoelias|Amphicoelias altus]]'', and ''[[Maraapunisaurus|M. fragilimus]]''. Smaller sauropods, such as ''[[Suuwassea|Suuwassea emiliae]]'' from [[Montana]], tend to be found in the northern reaches of the Morrison, near the shores of the ancient [[Sundance Sea]], suggesting ecological niches favoring smaller body size there compared with the giants found further south.&lt;ref name="harris&amp;dodson2004"&gt;Harris, J.D. and Dodson, P. (2004). "A new diplodocoid sauropod dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of Montana, USA." ''Acta Palaeontologica Polonica'', '''49'''(2): 197–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theropods==
[[Theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s, the [[carnivorous]] dinosaurs, came in several different types. The less [[Synapomorphy|derived]] types, the [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurs]] and [[Megalosauridae|megalosaurids]], included ''[[Ceratosaurus|Ceratosaurus nasicornis]]'', ''C. dentisulcatus'', ''C. magnicornis'', ''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'' sp., and the megalosaur ''[[Torvosaurus|Torvosaurus tanneri]]'' (including ''[[Edmarka|Edmarka rex]]''). [[Allosauridae|Allosaurids]] included the common ''[[Allosaurus|Allosaurus fragilis]]'' (including ''[[Epanterias|Epanterias amplexus]]''), ''Allosaurus'' new species, ''A. lucasi'', and giant ''[[Saurophaganax|Saurophaganax maximus]]'' (potentially included in ''Allosaurus''?). Also a recently discovered dinosaur has turned out to be a new species, not Allosaurus.

Indeterminate theropod remains have been recovered in Utah. Indeterminate theropod tracks have been recovered from both Utah and Arizona.&lt;ref name="jurassic-distribution-arizonautah" /&gt;

===Coelurosaurs===
[[Coelurosauria|Coelurosaurs]], more derived types more closely related to birds, included ''[[Coelurus|Coelurus fragilis]]'', ''[[Ornitholestes|Ornitholestes hermanni]]'', ''[[Tanycolagreus|Tanycolagreus topwilsoni]]'', the possible [[Troodontidae|troodontid]] ''[[Koparion|Koparion douglassi]]'', and the definite [[troodontid]] [[WDC DML 001]]. There was also the possible [[Tyrannosauroidea|early tyrannosaur relative]] ''[[Stokesosaurus clevelandi]]''.

==Eggs==
Dinosaur eggs have been found in Utah.&lt;ref name="jurassic-distribution-utah" /&gt;

==Tracks==

===Ornithopods===
Morrison ornithopod trace fossils are represented by three toed tracks which are generally small.&lt;ref name="foster-ornithopod-tracks" /&gt; The toes of Morrison ornithopod tracks are usually more widely splayed than the theropod tracks preserved in the formation.&lt;ref name="foster-ornithopod-tracks" /&gt;

===Stegosaurs===
Stegosaur tracks were first recognized in [[1996 in paleontology|1996]] from a hindprint-only trackway discovered at the Clevland-Lloyd quarry, which is located near Price, Utah.&lt;ref name="foster-stegosaur-tracks"&gt;"Walk and Don't Look Back: The Footprints; Stegosaurs" Foster (2007) pg. 238&lt;/ref&gt; [[1998 in paleontology|Two years later]], a new ichnogenus called ''Stegopodus'' was erected for another set of stegosaur tracks which were found near Arches National Park, also in Utah.&lt;ref name="foster-stegosaur-tracks" /&gt; Unlike the first, this trackway preserved traces of the forefeet. Fossil remains indicate that stegosaurs have five digits on the forefeet and three weight-bearing digits on the hind feet.&lt;ref name="foster-stegosaur-tracks" /&gt; From this, scientists were able to successfully predict the appearance of stegosaur tracks in [[1990 in paleontology|1990]], six years in advance of the first actual discovery of Morrison stegosaur tracks.&lt;ref name="foster-stegosaur-tracks" /&gt; Since the erection of ''Stegopodus'', more trackways have been found, however none have preserved traces of the front feet, and stegosaur traces remain rare.&lt;ref name="foster-stegosaur-tracks" /&gt;

===Theropods===
Indeterminate theropod tracks have been recovered from both Utah and Arizona.&lt;ref name="jurassic-distribution-arizonautah"&gt;"Dinosaur distribution (Late Jurassic; North America; 'Utah' and 'Arizona')." Weishampel, et al. (2004). Pg. 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15282">'''Marten Meile Gerrit "Mart" Bax''' (born 13 April 1937, [[Zutphen]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albumacademicum.uva.nl M.M.G. Bax] at the UvA ''Album Academicum'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; is a Dutch [[emeritus]] (retired in 2002) endowed professor in political [[anthropology]] at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] (VU University), Amsterdam, the Netherlands. After his retirement he came into prominence to a wider public in the Netherlands in 2012 because of serious suspicions of [[scientific misconduct]]. In September 2013 these suspicions were confirmed in an official report.

==Biography==
{{expandsection|date=October 2013}}
He wrote his [[dissertation]] (''cum laude''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albumacademicum.uva.nl/cgi/b/bib/bib-idx?type=simple;lang=nl;c=ap;rgn1=entirerecord;q1=bax;x=-511;y=-517;cc=ap;view=reslist;sort=achternaam;fmt=long;page=reslist;start=2;size=1 Album Academicum Amsterdam University]; the Baud-report pag. 34 talks about his M.A. thesis 1964 ("afgestudeerd")&lt;/ref&gt;) for the [[University of Amsterdam]] in 1973 about the anonymized Irish town "Patricksville".&lt;ref&gt;Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by [[Richard de Boer]] in [[Volkskrant]] April 13 page V3&lt;/ref&gt;

He further wrote about an anonymized pilgrimage center, called "Neerdonk" in the Dutch province of [[North Brabant]].

He also wrote extensively about the pilgrimage center [[Medjugorje]] in the former [[Yugoslavia]].

==Scientific misconduct==
The presentation by Bax of the town of "Patricksville" as having extensive corruption, bribery, and clientelism is considered controversial among experts.&lt;ref&gt;Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by [[Richard de Boer]] in [[Volkskrant]] April 13 page V5&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed in his scientific publications there had been an estimated 140 killings, 60 people missing and 600 refugees from the pilgrimage village [[Medjugorje]], in [[Bosnia]] during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995). Bax wrote that he had based his observations on extensive local field research. He called these killing the "small war". The reason for the killings in 1991/1992 were according to Bax not ethnic conflict but a [[feud|vendetta]] between [[clan]]s. Apart from very local writings near Medjugorje these claims were first criticized in journalistic writings in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Mappes-Niediek: [http://www.fr-online.de/kultur/krieg-in-bosnien-die-toten--die-es-nicht-gab,1472786,3307334.html ''Die Toten, die es nicht gab.''] In: ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]].'' 27.&amp;nbsp;August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013 at latest both the existence of the mass killing, missing people, and refugees turned to out to be false beyond reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vu.nl/nl/nieuws-agenda/nieuws/2013/jan-mrt/VU-onderzoekt-werk-emeritus-hoogleraar-Mart-Bax.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 the Dutch book ''Ontspoorde Wetenschap'' (Engl.: "Derailed science") by the [[science journalism|science journalist]] [[Frank van Kolfschooten]] was published. In the book Van Kolfschooten pointed to the lack of confirmation for the vendetta. Bax had published [[anonymization|anonymized]] results about field research that he stated to have done in a monastery in the province of [[North Brabant]], the Netherlands. Van Kolfschooten had doubts about the existence of the monastery, because the existence of the monastery could not be confirmed by experts and because Bax refused to tell anyone in confidence the name and the location of the monastery.The writings by Van Kolfschooten were largely based on the unpublished work of Dr. [[Peter Jan Margry]] of the [[Meertens institute]].&lt;ref&gt;'Ik kon begin jaren negentig al geen chocola van Bax' verhaal maken' by Patrick Meershoek in [[Het Parool]] September 24, 2013 page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Nederland/article/detail/3337170/2012/10/25/Hoogleraar-Politieke-Antropologie-VU-verzon-mogelijk-klooster.dhtml&lt;/ref&gt; The Free University, Amsterdam, reacted by announcing an investigation to Bax's works.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2012/10/25/academici-frauderen-vaker-dan-instituten-meldden/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch [[Volkskrant]] newspaper wrote in April 2013 that Bax's scientific writings about Medjugorje contained many important incorrect citations to local writings or to non-existing local writings.&lt;ref&gt;Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by [[Richard de Boer]] in [[Volkskrant]] April 13 page V5&lt;/ref&gt; Bax also incorrectly stated that the resident register was destroyed during the Bosnian war.&lt;ref&gt;Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by [[Richard de Boer]] in [[Volkskrant]] April 13 page V2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Volkskrant also wrote in the same lengthy article that approximately one third of the scientific publications that Bax had submitted in the internal database, called ''Metis'', of the university does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by [[Richard de Boer]] in [[Volkskrant]] April 13 page V5&lt;/ref&gt; The Volkskrant accuses him of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by [[Richard de Boer]] in [[Volkskrant]] April 13 page V5&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A commission to investigate this possible scientific misconduct was chaired by [[Michiel Baud]] and published its findings in a report dated September 9, 2013, and made public September 23, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vu.nl/nl/nieuws-agenda/nieuws/2013/apr-jun/commissie-baud-onderzoekt-beschuldiging-wetenschapsfraude.asp "Commissie-Baud onderzoekt beschuldiging wetenschapsfraude"]. VU nieuws, April 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michiel Baud, Susan Legêne, and Peter Pels (September 9, 2013). [http://www.vu.nl/nl/Images/20130910_RapportBax_tcm9-356928.pdf "Draaien om de werkelijkheid: Rapport over het antropologisch werk van prof. em. M.M.G. Bax"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928122206/http://www.vu.nl/nl/Images/20130910_RapportBax_tcm9-356928.pdf |date=2013-09-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vu.nl/nl/nieuws-agenda/nieuws/2013/jul-sep/College-van-Bestuur-VU-onderschrijft-conclusies-onderzoekscommissie-Baud.asp "College van Bestuur VU onderschrijft conclusies onderzoekscommissie Baud"]. VU nieuws, September 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission confirmed serious misconduct:
*Both in the Neerdonk case as well as in Medjugorje, Bax stated to have relied on one single local informant who told him improbable stories about public events that were not confirmed by anyone else. And Bax did not do any effort to check these stories. Bax wrote down the stories of these two alleged informants with certainty and in detail as if these they were historical facts. The commission considered this methodology scientifically irresponsible and a case of serious scientific misconduct. The commission considered these stories likely to be invented either by Bax or the informants. The commission was unable to interview these two informants, because one has died and the other one could not be found. So the most serious scientific misconduct accusation i.e. data fabrication by Bax could not be proved.
* Of the 161 publications claimed by Bax, 64 are non-existent. He signed off his yearly publication list, so this makes it a crime of written misrepresentation. This is fraud against his employer.&lt;ref&gt;Michiel Baud, Susan Legêne, and Peter Pels (September 9, 2013). [http://www.vu.nl/nl/Images/20130910_RapportBax_tcm9-356928.pdf "Draaien om de werkelijkheid: Rapport over het antropologisch werk van prof. em. M.M.G. Bax"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928122206/http://www.vu.nl/nl/Images/20130910_RapportBax_tcm9-356928.pdf |date=2013-09-28 }} pages 41 and 42&lt;/ref&gt;
* The case on the pilgrimage site "Neerdonk", subject of his published inaugural speech, was considered to be invented.
* The book ''Medjugorje: Religion, Politics, and Violence in Rural Bosnia'' (1995) mentions a blood feud for which there is no evidence at all. None of the inhabitants of the area are aware of anything like this happening.
* Shortly after the publication of book mentioned above, Bax stated that he misinterpreted some information, but claimed he did not have the chance to make any rectifications.
* The commission established he did have the opportunity to rectify these errors at various occasions, yet never did.
* After the publication of ''Medjugorje: Religion, Politics, and Violence in Rural Bosnia'', Bax referred to the blood feud in three other articles, after he already stated to be aware of the misinterpretation, which the commission labeled as "serious scientific misconduct".

The VU announced that it will warn academic publishers against Bax.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/5288/Onderwijs/article/detail/3515907/2013/09/25/VU-gaat-internationaal-waarschuwen-voor-Bax.dhtml&lt;/ref&gt;The VU stated that it will not take legal steps against Bax because he is old and because the crime of written misrepresentation has passed the statute of limitations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/5288/Onderwijs/article/detail/3515907/2013/09/25/VU-gaat-internationaal-waarschuwen-voor-Bax.dhtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions by Bax==
According to his own words, starting in the mid 1990s Margry could not make sense of Bax's works regarding the Neerdonk case, in particular Bax's inaugural speech from 1989. Margry contacted Bax and received replies from Bax that did not remove his doubts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Meershoeki|Meershoek, Patrick]] in [[Parool]] newspaper, 24 Sept 2013 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BU9DgvBCAAEwbZB.jpg:large https://www.meertens.knaw.nl/cms/files/Schermafbeelding%202013-09-27%20om%2016_58_05.png&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the [[Frankfurter Rundschau]] did not receive a reply from Bax about the fact that he could not have observed in Medjugorje what he claimed to have observed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fr-online.de/kultur/krieg-in-bosnien-die-toten--die-es-nicht-gab,1472786,3307334.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Van Kolfschooten did not receive a reply to the letters that he sent to Bax. 

In April 2013 Bax wrote to the [[Volkskrant]] the following.&lt;ref&gt;Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by [[Richard de Boer]] in [[Volkskrant]] April 13 page V3&lt;/ref&gt;
*Regarding the vendetta between clans in Medjugorje that Bax called "little war". This was due to a mistake that close colleagues warned him about in 1995 in which he confused [[Yugoslavia during World War II]] (1941–1945) with the [[Bosnian war]] (1991–1995). He stated that he had tried in vain to correct his mistake with a rectification in a second edition. The second edition never came however. He did not explain why he kept publishing about the "little war" for years after the end of the Bosnian war in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Door: Richard de Boer en Maarten Keulemans − 13/04/13, 05:56 [http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2672/Wetenschap-Gezondheid/article/detail/3424829/2013/04/13/Veldstudie-VU-antropoloog-Bax-zit-vol-onwaarheden.dhtml Veldstudie VU-antropoloog Bax zit vol onwaarheden]. See also the complete letter from Bax linked to in that article.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bax had written that the resident register had been destroyed during the Bosnian war. This is untrue. Bax explained this by stating that a key informant had told him that he did not need to do any effort to check the killings in the "little war". Bax admitted that in hindsight, he should have done more.
*Bax referred in his writings to a newspaper Mostarski List which never existed. According to Bax, this was not a newspaper but a secret pamphlet.
*Regarding the missing inhabitants due to the little war, Bax stated that he had seen vacated homes.

In 2013 the Baud committee spoke three times with Bax. In addition to the explanations to the Volkskrant, Bax said that he had written down improbable alleged historical events with certainty to make his articles accessible to readers. He stated that he had followed in this respect the example of [[Norbert Elias]].

In September 2013 Bax did not reply to the report of the Baud committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advalvas.vu.nl/nieuws/%E2%80%98ernstig-wetenschappelijk-wangedrag%E2%80%99-van-antropoloog-bax&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miniature Hydraulics''' are copies or [[Physical model|models]] that represent and reproduce regular or standard sized [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] systems and components, but in a reduced state, on a small scale, or in a greatly reduced size. True working and functional miniature hydraulics follow the same operating principles and behavioral properties as their standard or regular size hydraulic [[prototypes]], but are done so primarily at reduced sizes and pressures. Although uncommon, miniature hydraulics do exist, and are obtainable through a variety of sources. Miniature hydraulics, [[Small hydro|mini hydraulics]], and [[micro hydro|micro hydraulics]] are abbreviated as or otherwise known as M-H.

'''Nikolay Nikolayevich Rukavishnikov''' ({{Lang-ru|Никола́й Никола́евич Рукави́шников}}; September 18, 1932 – October 19, 2002) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] who flew three [[manned space mission|space missions]] of the [[Soyuz programme]]: [[Soyuz 10]], [[Soyuz 16]], and [[Soyuz 33]]. Two of these missions, Soyuz 10 and Soyuz 33 were intended to dock with [[Salyut]] [[space station]]s, but failed to do so.

==Biography==

Rukavishnikov studied at the [[Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute]] and after graduation worked for [[Sergey Korolev]]'s design bureau. He was selected for cosmonaut training in 1967.

Rukavishnikov became the 50th human to fly in space on April 23, 1971, the launch date of [[Soyuz 10]]. He subsequently resigned from the space programme in 1987 and returned to work for the same bureau he started with, by then known as Energia.

He died of a heart attack on October 18, 2002.

He was awarded:
*Twice [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]
*[[Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR]]
*Four [[Order of Lenin|Orders of Lenin]]
*[[Hero of the Mongolian People's Republic]]
*[[Hero of the People's Republic of Bulgaria]]
*[[Order of Sukhbaatar]] (People's Republic of Mongolia)
*[[Order of Georgi Dimitrov]] (People's Republic of Bulgaria)

'''Nobleite''' is a rare [[borate]] mineral with the chemical formula  CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It was discovered in 1961, in [[Death Valley]], [[California]], and is named for [[Levi F. Noble]], a [[USGS]] geologist, in honor of his contributions to the geology of the Death Valley region.

Nobleite has also been identified at two localities in [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].

==History==
The "far-fetched" possibility of using light for selectively controlling precise neural activity (action potential) patterns within subtypes of cells in the brain was thought of by [[Francis Crick]] in his Kuffler Lectures at the University of California in San Diego in 1999.&lt;ref name="Crick"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crick, F.|title=The impact of molecular biology on neuroscience |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |doi=10.1098/rstb.1999.0541 |volume=354 |issue=1392 |pages=2021–25 |date=December 1999 |pmid=10670022 |pmc=1692710}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier use of light to activate neurons was carried out by [[Richard Fork]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fork|first=R. L.|title=Laser stimulation of nerve cells in Aplysia|journal=Science|date=March 1971|volume=171|issue=3974|pages=907–8|doi=10.1126/science.171.3974.907|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/171/3974/907.abstract|bibcode = 1971Sci...171..907F|pmid=5541653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who demonstrated laser activation of neurons within intact tissue, although not in a genetically-targeted manner. The earliest genetically targeted method that used light to control rhodopsin-sensitized neurons was reported in January 2002, by [[Boris Valery Zemelman|Boris Zemelman]] and [[Gero Miesenböck]], who employed ''[[Drosophila]]'' [[rhodopsin]] cultured mammalian neurons.&lt;ref name="Zemelman 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Zemelman|first1=B.

[[Peter Hegemann]], studying the [[Phototaxis|light response]] of green algae at the University of Regensburg, had discovered photocurrents that were too fast to be explained by the classic g-protein-coupled [[Rhodopsin|animal rhodopsins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harz|first=Hartmann|last2=Hegemann|first2=Peter|date=1991-06-06|title=Rhodopsin-regulated calcium currents in Chlamydomonas|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v351/n6326/abs/351489a0.html?foxtrotcallback=true|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=351|issue=6326|pages=489–491|doi=10.1038/351489a0|bibcode=1991Natur.351..489H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaming up with the electrophysiologist Georg Nagel at the Max Planck Institute in Frankfurt, they could demonstrate that a single gene from the alga ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii|Chlamydomonas]]'' produced large photocurents when expressed in the oocyte of a frog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nagel|first=Georg|last2=Ollig|first2=Doris|last3=Fuhrmann|first3=Markus|last4=Kateriya|first4=Suneel|last5=Musti|first5=Anna Maria|last6=Bamberg|first6=Ernst|last7=Hegemann|first7=Peter|date=2002-06-28|title=Channelrhodopsin-1: A Light-Gated Proton Channel in Green Algae|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/296/5577/2395|journal=Science|language=en|volume=296|issue=5577|pages=2395–2398|doi=10.1126/science.1072068|issn=0036-8075|pmid=12089443|bibcode=2002Sci...296.2395N}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify expressing cells, they replaced the cytoplasmic tail of the algal protein with the fluorescent protein [[YFP]], generating the first generally applicable optogenetic tool.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2003" /&gt; 

Zhuo-Hua Pan of Wayne State University, researching on restore sight to blindness, thought about using channelrhodopsin when it came out in late 2003. By February 2004, he was trying channelrhodopsin out in ganglion cells—the neurons in our eyes that connect directly to the brain—that he had cultured in a dish. Indeed, the transfected neurons became electrically active in response to light. In 2005, Zhuo-Hua Pan reported successful in-vivo transfection of channelrhodopsin in retinal ganglion cells of mice, and electrical responses to photostimulation in retinal slice culture&lt;ref name="BiCui2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bi|first1=Anding|last2=Cui|first2=Jinjuan|last3=Ma|first3=Yu-Ping|last4=Olshevskaya|first4=Elena|last5=Pu|first5=Mingliang|last6=Dizhoor|first6=Alexander M.|last7=Pan|first7=Zhuo-Hua|title=Ectopic Expression of a Microbial-Type Rhodopsin Restores Visual Responses in Mice with Photoreceptor Degeneration|journal=Neuron|volume=50|issue=1|year=2006|pages=23–33|issn=0896-6273|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.02.026|pmid=16600853|pmc=1459045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optogenetics provides millisecond-scale temporal precision which allows the experimenter to keep pace with fast biological information processing (for example, in probing the causal role of specific [[action potential]] patterns in defined neurons). Indeed, to probe the neural code, optogenetics by definition must operate on the millisecond timescale to allow addition or deletion of precise activity patterns within specific cells in the brains of intact animals, including mammals (see '''Figure 1)'''. By comparison, the temporal precision of traditional genetic manipulations (employed to probe the causal role of specific genes within cells, via "loss-of-function" or "gain of function" changes in these genes) is rather slow, from hours or days to months. It is important to also have fast readouts in optogenetics that can keep pace with the optical control. This can be done with electrical recordings ("optrodes") or with reporter proteins that are [[biosensor]]s, where scientists have fused fluorescent proteins to detector proteins. An example of this is [[Genetically encoded voltage indicator|voltage-sensitive fluorescent protein]] (VSFP2).&lt;ref name="pmid22815406"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akemann | first1 = W | last2 = Mutoh | first2 = H | last3 = Perron | first3 = A | last4 = Park | first4 = YK | last5 = Iwamoto | first5 = Y | last6 = Knöpfel | first6 = T | year = 2012 | title = Imaging neural circuit dynamics with a voltage-sensitive fluorescent protein | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=22815406 | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 108 | issue = 8| pages = 2323–37 | doi = 10.1152/jn.00452.2012 | pmid = 22815406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, beyond its scientific impact optogenetics represents an important case study in the value of both ecological conservation (as many of the key tools of optogenetics arise from microbial organisms occupying specialized environmental niches), and in the importance of pure basic science as these opsins were studied over decades for their own sake by biophysicists and microbiologists, without involving consideration of their potential value in delivering insights into neuroscience and neuropsychiatric disease.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/optogenetics-controlling/|title=Optogenetics: Controlling the Brain with Light [Extended Version]|last=Deisseroth|first=Karl|newspaper=Scientific American|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

'''Light-activated proteins: channels, pumps and enzymes'''

The hallmark of optogenetics therefore is introduction of fast light-activated channels, pumps, and enzymes that allow temporally precise manipulation of electrical and biochemical events while maintaining cell-type resolution through the use of specific targeting mechanisms. Among the microbial opsins which can be used to investigate the function of neural systems are the [[channelrhodopsin]]s (ChR2, ChR1, VChR1, and SFOs) to excite neurons and [[anion-conducting channelrhodopsin]]s for light-induced inhibition. Indirectly light-controlled [[potassium channel|potassium channels]] have recently been engineered to prevent action potential generation in neurons during blue light illumination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=Sebastian|last2=Yu-Strzelczyk|first2=Jing|last3=Pauls|first3=Dennis|last4=Constantin|first4=Oana M.|last5=Gee|first5=Christine E.|last6=Ehmann|first6=Nadine|last7=Kittel|first7=Robert J.|last8=Nagel|first8=Georg|last9=Gao|first9=Shiqiang|date=2018|title=Synthetic Light-Activated Ion Channels for Optogenetic Activation and Inhibition|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00643/full|journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience|language=English|volume=12|doi=10.3389/fnins.2018.00643|issn=1662-453X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andrea Bernal Sierra|first=Yinth|last2=Rost|first2=Benjamin|last3=Oldani|first3=Silvia|last4=Schneider-Warme|first4=Franziska|last5=Seifert|first5=Reinhard|last6=Schmitz|first6=Dietmar|last7=Hegemann|first7=Peter|date=November 5, 2018|title=Potassium channel-based two component optogenetic tool for silencing of excitable cells|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2017.11.3607|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=114|issue=3|pages=668a|doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2017.11.3607|issn=0006-3495|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light-driven ion pumps are also used to inhibit neuronal activity, e.g. [[halorhodopsin]] (NpHR),&lt;ref name="Zhao 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Expression of optogenetic actuators'''

Optogenetics also necessarily includes the development of genetic targeting strategies such as cell-specific promoters or other customized conditionally-active viruses, to deliver the light-sensitive probes to specific populations of neurons in the brain of living animals (e.g. worms, fruit flies, mice, rats, and monkeys). In invertebrates such as worms and fruit flies some amount of [[all-trans-retinal]] (ATR) is supplemented with food. A key advantage of microbial opsins as noted above is that they are fully functional without the addition of exogenous co-factors in vertebrates.'''&lt;ref name="Gradinaru 2007" /&gt;'''

The technique of using optogenetics is flexible and adaptable to the experimenter's needs. For starters, experimenters genetically engineer a microbial opsin based on the [[Gating (electrophysiology)|gating]] properties (rate of excitability, refractory period, etc..) required for the experiment.

There is a challenge in introducing the microbial opsin, an optogenetic actuator, into a specific region of the organism in question. A rudimentary approach is to introduce an engineered viral vector that contains the optogenetic actuator gene attached to a recognizable [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] such as [[CAMK2A|CAMKIIα]]. This allows for some level of specificity as cells that already contain and can translate the given promoter will be infected with the viral vector and hopefully express the optogenetic actuator gene.

Another approach is the creation of transgenic mice where the optogenetic actuator gene is introduced into mice zygotes with a given promoter, most commonly [[CD90|Thy1]]. Introduction of the optogenetic actuator at an early stage allows for a larger genetic code to be incorporated and as a result, increases the specificity of cells to be infected.

A third and rather novel approach that has been developed is creating transgenic mice with [[Cre recombinase]], an enzyme that catalyzes recombination between two lox-P sites. Then by introducing an engineered viral vector containing the optogenetic actuator gene in between two lox-P sites, only the cells containing the Cre recombinase will express the microbial opsin. This last technique has allowed for multiple modified optogenetic actuators to be used without the need to create a whole line of transgenic animals every time a new microbial opsin is needed.

After the introduction and expression of the microbial opsin, depending on the type of analysis being performed, application of light can be placed at the terminal ends or the main region where the infected cells are situated. Light stimulation can be performed with a vast array of instruments from light emitting diodes ([[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s) or diode-pumped solid state ([[Diode-pumped solid-state laser|DPSS]]). These light sources are most commonly connected to a computer through a fiber optic cable. Recent advances include the advent of wireless head-mounted devices that also apply LED to targeted areas and as a result give the animal more freedom of mobility to reproduce ''in vivo'' results.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warden|first=Melissa R.|last2=Cardin|first2=Jessica A.|last3=Deisseroth|first3=Karl|date=2014-07-11|title=Optical Neural Interfaces|journal=Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering|volume=16|pages=103–129|doi=10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071813-104733|issn=1523-9829|pmc=4163158|pmid=25014785}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guru|first=Akash|last2=Post|first2=Ryan J|last3=Ho|first3=Yi-Yun|last4=Warden|first4=Melissa R|date=2015-07-25|title=Making Sense of Optogenetics|journal=International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=18|issue=11|doi=10.1093/ijnp/pyv079|issn=1461-1457|pmc=4756725|pmid=26209858|pages=pyv079}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

== Issues ==
Although already a powerful scientific tool, optogenetics, according to Doug Tischer &amp; Orion D. Weiner of the University of California San Francisco, should be regarded as a "first-generation [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]]" because of its immense potential for both utilization and optimization.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tischer|first=Doug|last2=Weiner|first2=Orion D.|date=2014-08-01|title=Illuminating cell signalling with optogenetic tools|url=http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v15/n8/full/nrm3837.html#optogenetic-control-of-signals-in-time|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|language=en|volume=15|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/nrm3837|issn=1471-0072|pmc=4145075|pmid=25027655}}&lt;/ref&gt; With that being said, the current approach to optogenetics is limited primarily by its versatility. Even within the field of Neuroscience where it is most potent, the technique is less robust on a subcellular level.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfn.org/~/media/SfN/Documents/Short%20Courses/2013%20Short%20Course%20I/SC1%20Deisseroth.ashx|title=Current Challenges in Optogenetics|last=Zalocusky|first=Kelly A|last2=Fenno|first2=Lief E|date=2013|website=Society for Neuroscience|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Deisseroth|first3=Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selective expression ===

One of the main problems of optogenetics is that not all the cells in question may express the microbial opsin gene at the same level. Thus, even illumination with a defined light intensity will have variable effects on individual cells. Optogenetic stimulation of neurons in the brain is even less controlled as the light intensity drops exponentially from the light source (e.g. implanted optical fiber).

Moreover, mathematical modelling shows that selective expression of opsin in specific cell types can dramatically alter the dynamical behavior of the neural circuitry. In particular, optogenetic stimulation that preferentially targets inhibitory cells can transform the excitability of the neural tissue from Type 1 — where neurons operate as integrators — to Type 2 where neurons operate as resonators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heitmann|first=Stewart|last2=Rule|first2=Michael|last3=Truccolo|first3=Wilson|last4=Ermentrout|first4=Bard|date=2017|title=Optogenetic stimulation shifts the excitability of cerebral cortex from Type I to Type II: Oscillation onset and wave propagation|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|volume=13|issue=1|pages=e1005349|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005349|issn=1553-7358|bibcode=2017PLSCB..13E5349H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Type 1 excitable media sustain propagating waves of activity whereas Type 2 excitable media do not. The transformation from one to the other explains how constant optical stimulation of primate motor cortex elicits gamma-band (40–80&amp;nbsp;Hz) oscillations in the manner of a Type 2 excitable medium. Yet those same oscillations propagate far into the surrounding tissue in the manner of a Type 1 excitable medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Yao|last2=Truccolo|first2=Wilson|last3=Wagner|first3=Fabien B.|last4=Vargas-Irwin|first4=Carlos E.|last5=Ozden|first5=Ilker|last6=Zimmermann|first6=Jonas B.|last7=May|first7=Travis|last8=Agha|first8=Naubahar S.|last9=Wang|first9=Jing|last10=Nurmikko|first10=Arto V.|date=2016|title=Optogenetically induced spatiotemporal gamma oscillations and neuronal spiking activity in primate motor cortex|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=113|issue=10|pages=3574–3587|doi=10.1152/jn.00792.2014|issn=1522-1598|pmc=4461886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, it remains difficult to target opsin to defined subcellular compartments, e.g. the plasma membrane, synaptic vesicles, or mitochondria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gradinaru|first=Viviana|last2=Thompson|first2=Kimberly R.|last3=Deisseroth|first3=Karl|date=2008-08-01|title=eNpHR: a Natronomonas halorhodopsin enhanced for optogenetic applications|journal=Brain Cell Biology|volume=36|issue=1–4|pages=129–139|doi=10.1007/s11068-008-9027-6|issn=1559-7113|pmc=2588488|pmid=18677566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restricting the opsin to specific regions of the plasma membrane such as [[dendrite]]s, [[Soma (biology)|somata]] or [[axon terminal]]s would provide a more robust understanding of neuronal circuitry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Kinetics and synchronization ===

An issue with channelrhodopsin-2 is that its gating properties don't mimic ''in vivo'' cation channels of cortical neurons. A solution to this issue with a protein's kinetic property is introduction of variants of channelrhodopsin-2 with more favorable kinetics.&lt;sup&gt;[[Optogenetics#cite note-:0-55|[55]]][56]&lt;/sup&gt;

Another one of the technique's limitations is that light stimulation produces a synchronous activation of infected cells and this removes any individual cell properties of activation among the population affected. Therefore, it is difficult to understand how the cells in the population affected communicate with one another or how their phasic properties of activation may relate to the circuitry being observed.

Optogenetic activation has been combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (ofMRI) to elucidate the [[connectome]], a thorough map of the brain’s neural connections. The results, however, are limited by the general properties of [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leergaard|first=Trygve B.|last2=Hilgetag|first2=Claus C.|last3=Sporns|first3=Olaf|date=2012-05-01|title=Mapping the Connectome: Multi-Level Analysis of Brain Connectivity|journal=Frontiers in Neuroinformatics|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fninf.2012.00014|issn=1662-5196|pmc=3340894|pmid=22557964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The readouts from this neuroimaging procedure lack the spatial and temporal resolution appropriate for studying the densely packed and rapid-firing neuronal circuits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Excitation spectrum ===

The opsin proteins currently in use have absorption peaks across the visual spectrum, but remain considerable sensitivity to blue light.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This spectral overlap makes it very difficult to combine opsin activation with genenetically encoded indictors ([[Genetically encoded voltage indicator|GEVIs]], [[Genetically encoded calcium sensor|GECIs]], [[Glutamate-sensitive fluorescent reporter|GluSnFR]], [[synapto-pHluorin]]), most of which need blue light excitation. Opsins with infrared activation would, at a standard irradiance value, increase light penetration and augment resolution through reduction of light scattering.

===Precise temporal control of interventions===
The currently available optogenetic actuators allow for the accurate temporal control of the required intervention (i.e. inhibition or excitation of the target neurons) with precision routinely going down to the millisecond level. Therefore, experiments can now be devised where the light used for the intervention is triggered by a particular '''element of behavior''' (to inhibit the behavior), a particular '''unconditioned stimulus''' (to associate something to that stimulus) or a particular '''oscillatory event''' in the brain (to inhibit the event). This kind of approach has already been used in several brain regions:

====Hippocampus====
[[Sharp waves and ripples|Sharp waves and ripple complexes]] (SWRs) are distinct high frequency oscillatory events in the [[hippocampus]] thought to play a role in memory formation and consolidation. These events can be readily detected by following the oscillatory cycles of the on-line recorded [[local field potential]]. In this way the onset of the event can be used as a trigger signal for a light flash that is guided back into the hippocampus to inhibit neurons specifically during the SWRs and also to optogenetically inhibit the oscillation itself&lt;ref name="pmid27760158"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovacs KA, O'Neill J, Schoenenberger P, Penttonen M, Ranguel Guerrero DK, Csicsvari J | title = Optogenetically Blocking Sharp Wave Ripple Events in Sleep Does Not Interfere with the Formation of Stable Spatial Representation in the CA1 Area of the Hippocampus | journal = PLOS ONE | date = 19 Nov 2016 | pmid = 27760158 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0164675 | volume=11 | pmc=5070819 | pages=e0164675| bibcode=2016PLoSO..1164675K }}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of "closed-loop" experiments are useful to study SWR complexes and their role in memory.

'''[[Economics]]''' &amp;ndash; analyzes the [[Production theory basics|production]], [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]], and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]]. It aims to explain how [[economy|economies]] work and how economic [[Agent (economics)|agents]] interact.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Description of economics ==
Economics can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; body of knowledge given to, or received by, a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialize in.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many economics-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.

== Branches of economics ==
* [[Macroeconomics]] &amp;ndash; branch of economics dealing with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an economy as a whole, rather than individual markets.
* [[Microeconomics]] &amp;ndash; branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources.

'''PQube''' is a registered trademark&lt;ref&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov U.S. Trademark 78,587,957]&lt;/ref&gt; of Power Standards Lab for an electronic measuring instrument that records [[power quality]] and [[electric energy]] on the [[electric power grid]].

==Applications==
PQube instruments are widely used to gather data for academic research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org|title=High harmonic distorion in new building due to multitude of electronic equipment|author= Timens, R.B. et al|year= 2011 |work=IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2012/EECS-2012-21.pdf |format=PDF|title=Experiences Integrating Building Data with sMAP"|author= S.

Each PQube instrument is traceable to the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], so often these instruments are used in international academic and research environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~ee07128/tese/docs/PDI_Relatorio_Final_ee07128.pdf "Monitorização em tempo-real de parâmetros de qualidade da rede elétrica a partir de diferentes locais em Portugal Continental", N.

PQubes are a key element in many [[Smart Grid]] projects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/SG%202010%20Peer%20Review%20-%20Marin%20County%20Renewables,%20David%20Cohen,%20Infotility.pdf "Integrating GridAgents into SmartGrid Applications", D.

Pope, July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; recording power disturbance and power flow data to examine efficiency and reliability effects.

== Information on the Web ==
Approximately 50 PQubes, located in approximately 40 countries, have been designated by their owners as free public sources of information at &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://map.pqube.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; . The site is updated approximately every 2 minutes with worldwide power quality and energy recordings.  

Data from these PQubes can be used, for example, for developing and testing power quality algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org "Superiority of decision tree classifier on complicated cases for power system protection", O. Ozgonenel, 11th International Conference on Developments in Power Systems Protection, April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://2012emc.org "Voltage Quality in Urban and Rural Areas", Timens et al., Netherlands, 9/2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://eetd-seminars.lbl.gov/seminar/fukushima-mexico-slovenia-free-electric-power-recordings-researchers "Fukushima, Mexico and Slovenia: Free Electric Power Recordings for Researchers"]&lt;/ref&gt; Available data include daily, weekly, and monthly files in GIF and [[Microsoft Excel]] CSV format. Voltage and current oscillographs are recorded during every power disturbance and these worldwide locations, and are freely available.  Data from each worldwide site is updated approximately once per minute.
