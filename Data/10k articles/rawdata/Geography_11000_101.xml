A '''Canaanean blade''' is an [[archaeological]] term for a long, wide blade made out of stone or [[flint]], predominantly found at sites in Israel and [[Lebanon]] (ancient [[Canaan]]). They were first manufactured and used in the [[Neolithic]] [[Stone Age]] to be used as [[weapons]] such as [[javelin]]s or [[arrowheads]]. The same technology was used during the later [[Chalcolithic]] period in the production of broad [[sickle]] blade elements for harvesting of crops.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lorraine Copeland|author2=P. Wescombe|title=Inventory of Stone-Age sites in Lebanon, p. 48, 146 &amp; Figure XVII, p. 163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YsRRwAACAAJ|accessdate=21 July 2011|year=1965|publisher=Imprimerie Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canaanean blades were also used in the threshing of cereal grains. This indicates the presence of early agricultural technologies. The blades would be attached to a small wooden platform with bitumen. The platform, with a human or other weight standing on it, was then pulled behind an animal across a threshing floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archaeologychannel.org/video-guide/video-guide-menu/video-guide-summary/144-tools-techniques-and-tablets-retracing-ancient-agricultural-heritage|title=Tools, Techniques and Tablets: Retracing Ancient Agricultural Heritage|website=www.archaeologychannel.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forward motion of the animal paired with the downward force of weight exerted through the blades served to cut grain into small pieces.

[[Image:Chabahil Chowk.jpg|thumb|The main ''Chowk'' (square) of Chabahil]]
'''Chabahil''' ({{lang-ne|चाबहिल}}) (also [[Kathmandu Metropolitan City]] Ward 07&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ward 07 |url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/sites/kathmandu.gov.np/files/ward%207.pdf |publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)is an ancient neighbourhood at the northeastern side of the [[Kathmandu]] in [[Nepal]]. It is famous for its [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] [[stupa]], called the Dhando Chaitya considered by many historians to be the oldest [[Buddhist Stupa]] in the valley. Currently, Chabahil has become a thriving residential and commercial area of [[Kathmandu]]. Apart from the large temples, there are many more small temples around them. Two of the most important temples in Kathmandu, [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]] and [[Guhyeswari]] are situated very close to Chabahil. These two temples, dedicated to Lord [[Shiva]] and his consort [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]] are considered to be more than a thousand years old.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Charumati Vihara==
The stupa has attracted [[Buddhist]] monks and other pilgrims over the centuries. According to the inscriptions found within it, it was built by the Indian princess [[Charumati]], daughter of Indian Emperor Ashoka, who was married to a Nepalese prince in [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dhanavajra Vajracharya''', Licchavikalin Abhilekha, Kathmandu : Nepal Asiali Adyayan Sansthan, 2030 B.S. p-392&lt;/ref&gt; Near the Charumati Vihara, there is a beautiful stone statue of Buddha that is a meter high.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Chandra Binayak Temple==
Another landmark located in the town is the temple of Chandra Binayak [[Ganesh]], the Hindu god with the head of an elephant and the body of a man. which is the youngest son of shiva Hindu god. The temple, located on the main market street of Chabahil, is one of the four temples of Binayak in the Kathmandu Valley. Devotees flock to this century-old temple especially on Tuesdays (and other days when Lord Ganesh is worshiped).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Orion 3008 huge (detail).jpg|thumb|250px|Several nebulae in the [[constellation]] [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] commonly called ''deep-sky objects'']]
'''Deep-sky object''' (abbreviated as '''DSO''') is a term designating any [[astronomical object]] that is not an individual star or [[Solar System]] object (such as [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[planet]], [[comet]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wcoRISdUnu4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;dq=deep+sky+object++Houston&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=deep%20sky%20object%20%20Houston&amp;f=false Fred Schaaf, 40 nights to knowing the sky: a night-by-night skywatching primer, page 113]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IUTwSFOtY4C&amp;pg=PT263&amp;dq=popularity+deep+sky+object&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Ian Ridpath, The illustrated encyclopedia of the universe, page 273]&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is used for the most part by [[amateur astronomer]]s to denote visually observed faint naked eye and [[Optical telescope|telescopic]] objects such as [[star cluster]]s, [[nebula]]e and [[galaxy|galaxies]].  This distinction is practical and technical, implying a variety of instruments and techniques appropriate to observation, and does not distinguish the nature of the object itself.

==Origins and classification==
Classifying non-stellar astronomical objects began soon after the invention of the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t9HzRdUvHD8C&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Messier+called+nebula#v=onepage&amp;q=Messier%20called%20nebula&amp;f=false Rocky Kolb, Blind watchers of the sky, page 174]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest comprehensive lists was [[Charles Messier]]'s 1774 [[Messier catalog]], which included 103 "''nebulae''" and other faint fuzzy objects he considered a nuisance since they could be mistaken for comets, the objects he was actually searching for.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t9HzRdUvHD8C&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Messier+called+nebula#v=onepage&amp;q=Messier%20called%20nebula&amp;f=false Rocky Kolb, Blind watchers of the sky, page 174]&lt;/ref&gt; As telescopes improved these faint nebulae would be broken into more descriptive scientific classifications such as [[interstellar cloud]]s, star clusters, and galaxies.

"''Deep-sky object''", as an astronomical classification for these objects, has its origins in the modern field of amateur astronomy. The origin of the term is unknown but it was popularized by ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]'' magazine's "Deep-Sky Wonders" column, which premiered in their first edition in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3rgOAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22deep+sky+wonders%22&amp;dq=%22deep+sky+wonders%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=1900&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=1943&amp;as_brr=0 Sky and telescope, Volumes 1-2]&lt;/ref&gt; created by [[Leland S. Copeland]], written for the majority of its run by [[Walter Scott Houston]], and currently penned by [[Sue French]]. Houston's columns, and later book compilations of those columns, helped popularize the term,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wcoRISdUnu4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;dq=deep+sky+object++Houston&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=deep%20sky%20object%20%20Houston&amp;f=false Fred Schaaf, 40 nights to knowing the sky: a night-by-night skywatching primer, page 13]&lt;/ref&gt; each month giving the reader a guided tour of a small part of the sky highlighting well known and lesser known objects for binoculars and small telescopes.

==Observations and activities==
[[File:CygnusOBmap.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of the constellation [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] marking the location of bright and more challenging deep-sky objects]]
There are many amateur astronomical techniques and activities associated with deep-sky objects. Some of these objects are bright enough to find and see in binoculars and small telescopes. But the faintest objects need the [[Optical telescope#Light-gathering power|light-gathering power]] of telescopes with large [[Objective (optics)|objectives]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wWdvYeDbf8gC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=observing+deep+sky+large+telescope#v=onepage&amp;q=observing%20deep%20sky%20large%20telescope&amp;f=false Grant Privett, Paul Parsons, The deep-sky observer's year, page 11]&lt;/ref&gt; and since they are invisible to the naked eye, can be hard to find. This has led to increased popularity in [[GoTo (telescopes)|GoTo telescopes]] that can find DSOs automatically, and large [[reflecting telescope]]s, such as [[Dobsonian]] style telescopes, with wide fields of view well suited for such observing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=HKMKjfKNzE4C&amp;dq=popularity+deep+sky+object&amp;q=popularity+#search_anchor Rajiv Gupta, Observer's Handbook 2005, page 73]&lt;/ref&gt; Observing faint objects needs dark skies, so these relatively portable types of telescopes also lend themselves to the majority of amateurs who need to travel outside [[light pollution|light polluted]] urban locations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer's Handbook'', Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; To cut down light pollution and enhance contrast observers employ "''[[Astronomical filter#Nebular filters|nebular filters]]''" designed to admit certain wavelength and block others.

There are organized activities associated with DSOs such as the [[Messier marathon]] which occurs at a specific time each year and involve observers trying to spot all 110 Messier objects in one night. Since the Messier catalog objects were discovered with relatively small 18th century telescopes it is a popular list with observers, being well within the grasp of most modern amateur telescopes. A much more demanding test known as the [[Herschel 400 Catalogue|Herschel 400]] is designed to tax larger [[telescopes]] and experienced amateur astronomers.

==List of deep-sky object types==
There are many astronomical object types that come under the description of ''deep-sky objects''. Since the definition is objects that are non-Solar System and non-stellar the list includes:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JMDiXFE39HQC&amp;pg=PT10&amp;dq=deep+sky+object#v=onepage&amp;q=deep%20sky%20object&amp;f=false W.

{{Gold Coast (Ghana)}}
The '''Dutch Gold Coast''' or '''Dutch Guinea''', officially '''Dutch possessions on the Coast of Guinea''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Nederlandse Bezittingen ter Kuste van Guinea'') was a portion of contemporary [[Ghana]] that was gradually colonized by the [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]], beginning in 1598. The colony became the most important Dutch colony in [[West Africa]] after [[Battle of Elmina (1637)|Fort Elmina was captured]] from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in 1637, but fell into disarray after the [[abolition of slavery timeline|abolition of the slave trade]] in the early 19th century. On 6 April 1872, the Dutch Gold Coast was, in accordance with the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870–71]], ceremonially ceded to the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adhin|1961|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The Dutch settle on the Gold Coast===
{{see also|Battle of Elmina (1625)|Battle of Elmina (1637)}}
[[File:Johannes-vingboons-11-kasteel-elmina-en-fort-nassau-ghana.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[Johannes Vingboons]] of both Fort São Jorge at Elmina and Fort Nassau at Moree.]]
The Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in contemporary [[Ghana]]. By 1471, they had reached the area that was to become known as the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] because it was an important source of gold. The Portuguese trading interests in [[gold]], [[ivory]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] so increased that in 1482 the Portuguese built their first permanent trading post on the western coast of present-day Ghana. This fortress, a trade castle called [[São Jorge da Mina]], was constructed to protect Portuguese trade from European competitors.&lt;ref name=eec&gt;McLaughlin &amp; Owusu-Ansah (1994), "Early European Contact and the Slave Trade".&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese position on the Gold Coast, known as [[Portuguese Gold Coast]], remained secure for over a century. During that time, [[Lisbon]] sought to monopolize all trade in the region in royal hands, though appointed officials at São Jorge, and used force to prevent English, French and Dutch efforts to trade on the coast. After [[Barent Eriksz]] successfully sailed to the Gold Coast in 1591, Dutch merchants began trading in the area. [[Pieter de Marees]]'s publications greatly increased the interest of merchants in the region.&lt;ref name="Delepeleire 2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Delepeleire|2004}}, section 1.a.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElMina AtlasBlaeuvanderHem.jpg|thumb|right|Elmina Castle in the [[Joan Blaeu|Blaeu]]-Van der Hem Atlas.]]
The [[Twelve Years' Truce]] between Portugal-Spain and the Dutch Republic, which lasted from 1609 to 1621, disrupted Dutch trade on the Gold Coast, as the Portuguese now had sufficient resources to protect their trade monopoly. Dutch traders then petitioned the States-General of the Dutch Republic to build a fort on the coast. The States-General were receptive of their demands, and sent [[Jacob Clantius]], who was to become the first General on the Coast, to the Gold Coast in 1611. In 1612, after gaining permission of the local rulers through the [[Treaty of Asebu]], he built [[Fort Nassau (Ghana)|Fort Nassau]] near [[Moree, Ghana|Moree]], on the site of an original Dutch trading post that had been burned down by the Portuguese.

After the Twelve Years's Truce ended in 1621, the [[Dutch West India Company]] was established, which tried to seize the Portuguese colonies in Africa and America as part of the ''[[Groot Desseyn]]'' plan. After [[Battle of Elmina (1625)|failing in 1625]], the company managed to [[Battle of Elmina (1637)|capture Elmina Castle from the Portuguese in 1637]]. [[Fort San Sebastian]] at [[Shama, Ghana|Shama]] and [[Fort Santo Antonio]] at [[Axim]] followed in 1640 and 1642 respectively.

===Competition with other European powers===
[[File:DeRuijter-Goudkust.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Gold Coast ordered by Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] in 1666, during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]].]]
The [[Dutch West India Company]] was given the monopoly on trade in the West Indies, including the Gold Coast, in 1621. Mismanagement meant that several disillusioned employees of the Dutch West India Company left the company to work for another European power. [[Hendrik Carloff]], for example, was a former high-ranking officer in the company, who joined the [[Swedish Africa Company]], founded in 1649 by the Walloon-Dutch industrialist [[Louis De Geer (1587–1652)|Louis De Geer]]. In the end, Carloff also left the Swedish company, this time for the [[Danish Africa Company]], which he founded himself with Isaac Coymans and Nicolaes Pancras, also former Dutch West India Company employees.

Whereas [[Swedish Gold Coast|Swedish presence on the Gold Coast]] turned out to be only temporary, [[Gold Coast (British colony)|British]] and [[Danish Gold Coast|Danish]] settlement in the area proved to be permanent. From 1694 until 1700, the Dutch West India Company fought the [[Komenda Wars]] with the British over trade rights with the Eguafo Kingdom. In addition, [[Brandenburger Gold Coast|Brandenburgers]] also had forts in the area from 1682 onwards, until they were bought out by the Dutch in 1717. The Portuguese had completely left the area, but still the Gold Coast had the highest concentration of European military architecture outside of Europe.

===Relationship with local peoples===
[[File:Butre 1656.jpg|thumb|left|The first page of the Treaty of Butre, signed on 17 August 1656.]]
The European powers were sometimes drawn into conflicts with local inhabitants as Europeans developed commercial alliances with local political authorities. These alliances, often complicated, involved both Europeans attempting to enlist or persuade their closest allies to attack rival European ports and their African allies, or conversely, various African powers seeking to recruit Europeans as mercenaries in their inter-state wars, or as diplomats to resolve conflicts. Another way conflicts with the local inhabitants was avoided was through marriage. European men often created alliances with the local African people through a practice known as '''[[cassare]]''' or '''calisare''' derived from the Portuguese '''casar''' meaning "to marry." Dutch men and other Europeans would marry African woman whose families had ties to the Atlantic slave trade. In this way, both Africans and Europeans benefited from each other and allowed for peaceful trading partnerships. African wives could receive money and schooling for the children they bore by European men. Wives could also inherit slaves and property from their husbands when they returned to Europe or died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ipsen|first1=Pernille|title=Daughters of the Trade: Atlantic Slavers and Interracial Marriage on the Gold Coast|isbn=978-0-8122-4673-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many coastal ethnic groups in Africa, such as the Ga and Fante, used this system to gain political and economic advantages. These African ethnic groups had been using this practice before the arrival of the Europeans with strangers of a different ethnicity, and extended the same privilege to European men by the late 1400s. '''Cassare''' enabled Africans to trust strangers, like the Europeans, when dealing within their trade networks. It made the transition between stranger and trade partner a lot smoother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ray|first1=Carina E.|title=Crossing the Color Line: Race, Sex, and the Contested Politics of Colonialism in Ghana|publisher=Ohio University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Elmina, the Dutch had inherited from the Portuguese a system in which tribute was paid to the [[Denkyira]], who were the dominant power in the region. After the [[Battle of Feyiase]] (1701), the [[Ashanti Empire]] replaced the Denkyira as the dominant power, and the Dutch began paying tribute to the Ashanti instead. Although the existence of the so-called "Elmina Note" is often questioned, the Dutch generally paid two ounces of [[gold]] per month to the Ashanti as tribute.&lt;ref&gt;see {{harvnb|Yarak|1986}} and {{harvnb|Feinberg|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bond between the Dutch and the Ashanti, who through the port of Elmina had access to trade with the Dutch and the rest of the world, deeply affected the relations between the Dutch, the other local peoples and the British. The latter were increasingly tight with the [[Fante people|Fante]], to which the Denkyira and thus also Elmina were culturally and linguistically close. Several [[Ashanti–Fante War|Ashanti-Fante wars]] followed and the rivalry between the two peoples were key in the events surrounding the transfer of the Dutch Gold Coast to Britain in 1872.

After the Dutch managed to dislodge the Swedes from Butre and began building [[Fort Batenstein]] at that site, the leaders of the Dutch West India Company thought it beneficial to negotiate a treaty with the local political leadership in order to establish a peaceful long-term relationship in the area. The local [[Ahanta]] leaders found it equally beneficial to enter into such an agreement, and thus on 27 August 1656, the [[Treaty of Butre]] was signed. This treaty established a Dutch protectorate in the area, and established diplomatic ties between the Dutch Republic and the Ahanta. The treaty's arrangements proved very stable and regulated Dutch-Ahanta diplomatic affairs for more than 213 years. Only after the Gold Coast was sold to Britain in 1872 were the provisions of the treaty abrogated.

On 18 February 1782, as part of the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], [[Shirley's Gold Coast expedition|the British attacked Elmina]]. Although this attack failed, Britain seized Fort Nassau, Fort Amsterdam, Fort Lijdzaamheid, Fort Goede Hoop and Fort Crêvecoeur from the Dutch. The Dutch Republic only managed to seize Fort Sekondi from the British. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1784)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1784, all forts returned to their pre-war owners.

===Disestablishment of the DWIC and the abolition of slave trade===
[[File:Posthumous Portrait of Herman Willem Daendels, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies - Rd Saleh.jpg|thumb|right|Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels (1815–1818)]]
In 1791, the Dutch West India Company was disestablished, and on 1 January 1792, all territories held by the company reverted to the rule of the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] of the [[Dutch Republic]]. During the French occupation of the Netherlands between 1810 and 1814, the Dutch possessions on the Gold Coast held the rather unusual position&amp;mdash;together with the island of [[Deshima]] in [[Japan]]&amp;mdash;of being the only Dutch territories not occupied by either France or Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagtglas|1863|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act of 1807]] effectively ended all slave trade from the Gold Coast. [[William I of the Netherlands]] took over this abolition when he issued a royal decree to that effect in June 1814 and signed the [[Anglo-Dutch Slave Trade Treaty]] in May 1818. The abolition of slave trade was coupled with the arrival of [[Herman Willem Daendels]] as Governor-General. Daendels was a [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriot]] who played a major role in the [[Batavian Revolution]], and subsequently became [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] for the [[Batavian Republic]] in 1807. This republican and revolutionist background made him controversial in the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] established in 1815, which effectively banned him from the country by assigning to him the rather obscure governorship of the Gold Coast in 1815.

Daendels tried to redevelop the rather dilapidated Dutch possessions as an African [[plantation]] [[colony]] driven by legitimate trade. Drawing on his experience in building the [[Great Post Road]] on the island of [[Java]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]], he came up with some very ambitious infrastructural projects, including a comprehensive road system, with a main road connecting Elmina and [[Kumasi]] in [[Ashanti Empire|Ashanti]]. The Dutch government gave him a free hand and a substantial budget to implement his plans. At the same time, however, Daendels regarded his governorship as an opportunity to establish a private business monopoly in the Dutch Gold Coast.

Eventually none of the plans came to fruition, as Daendels died of [[malaria]] in the castle of [[Elmina|St. George d'Elmina]], the Dutch seat of government, on 8 May 1818. His body was interred in the central tomb at the Dutch cemetery in [[Elmina]] town. He had been in the country less than two years.

===Recruitment of soldiers for the Dutch East Indies Army===
[[File:Aquasi Boachi and Quamin Poko by JL Cornet.jpg|thumb|left|The Ashanti princes [[Kwasi Boachi]] and Kwame Poku, who were sent to the Netherlands to receive education.]]
In the remainder of the 19th century, the Dutch Gold Coast slowly fell into disarray. The only substantial development during this period was the recruitment of soldiers for the [[Dutch East Indies Army]]. This recruitment of the so-called [[Belanda Hitam]] (Indonesian for "Black Dutchmen") started in 1831 as an emergency measure as the Dutch army lost thousands of European soldiers and a much larger number of "native" soldiers in the [[Java War]] (1825–1830), and at the same time saw its own population base diminished by the independence of [[Belgium]] (1830). As the Dutch wanted the number of natives in the Dutch East Indies Army to be limited to roughly half the total strength to maintain the loyalty of native forces, the addition of forces from the Gold Coast seemed an ideal opportunity to keep the army at strength and loyal at the same time. It was also hoped that the African soldiers would be more resistant to the tropical climate and tropical diseases of the Dutch East Indies than European soldiers.

In 1836, the Dutch government had decided to recruit soldiers via the King of Ashanti. Major General [[Jan Verveer]] arrived for this purpose in Elmina on 1 November 1836, and went to the Ashanti capital of [[Kumasi]] with a delegation of about 900 people. After long negotiations, an agreement with King [[Kwaku Dua I Panyin|Kwaku Dua I]] was reached. A recruitment depot was established in Kumasi, and furthermore the king sent the young Ashanti princes [[Kwasi Boachi]] and [[Kwame Poku]] with General Verveer to take with him to the Netherlands, so that they could receive a good education. Kwasi Boachi later received education at the forerunner of [[Delft University]] and became the first black Dutch [[mining engineer]] in the Dutch East Indies. Dutch author [[Arthur Japin]] wrote a novel about the life of the two princes with ''[[The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi]]'' (1997).

===Trade of forts with Britain and subsequent cession===
[[File:Dutch Gold Coast after the Anglo-Dutch forts trade (1867).jpg|thumb|right|The Dutch Gold Coast after the trade of forts with the British.]]
Whereas the Dutch forts were a colonial backwater in the 19th century, the British forts were slowly developed into a full colony, especially after Britain took over the [[Danish Gold Coast]] in 1850. The presence of Dutch forts in an area that became increasingly influenced by the United Kingdom was deemed undesirable, and in the late 1850s British began pressing for either a buyout of the Dutch forts, or a trade of forts so as to produce more coherent areas of influence.

In the Dutch political landscape of the time, a buyout was not a possibility, so a trade of forts was negotiated. In 1867, the [[Anglo-Dutch Gold Coast Treaty (1867)|Convention between Great Britain and the Netherlands for an Interchange of Territory on the Gold Coast of Africa]] was signed, in which all Dutch forts to the east of Elmina were handed over to Britain, while the British forts west of Elmina were handed over to the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="FCOtrade"&gt;Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office - [http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/treaties/treaties-landing/records/08400/08421 Convention between Great Britain and the Netherlands for an Interchange of Territory on the Gold Coast of Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade proved a disaster for the Dutch, as their long-standing alliance with the mighty inland [[Ashanti Empire]] did not fare well with the coastal [[Fante people|Fante]] population around the new forts assigned to them, who were allied with the British. To subject the local people around Fort Komenda, the Dutch had to [[Dutch Gold Coast expedition of 1869–1870|send an expeditionary force]] to the local capital of Kwassie-Krom. Meanwhile, a [[Fante Confederacy]] was founded to drive the Dutch and their Ashanti allies out of Elmina.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gramberg|1868|pp=391–396}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confederacy founded an army, which marched to Elmina in March 1868. Although the army was deemed strong enough in April to begin the siege of the town, struggle between the various tribes united in the confederacy meant that the siege was lifted in May. In June, a peace treaty between the confederacy and Elmina was signed, in which Elmina pledged to be neutral if war was to break out between the Ashanti and Fante.

[[File:Elmina ca. 1865.jpg|thumb|left|Rare photograph of Elmina from around 1865, showing parts of the old town later destroyed during the British bombardment.]]
The blockade of the town by the confederacy was not lifted, however, and trade between Elmina and the Ashanti dropped to an absolute minimum. Attempts were made to persuade Elmina to join the confederacy, to no avail. Elmina and the Dutch sent a request for help to the king of Ashanti, whose army, under the leadership of Atjempon, arrived in Elmina on 27 December 1869. Unsurprisingly, the Ashanti army had an uncompromising attitude to their Fante rivals, making the prospect of a compromise between the Ashanti-backed Elminese and the new Fante-dominated forts transferred to the Dutch ever more difficult.

Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, the ongoing conflicts made the call for the transfer of the entire colony to Britain to become ever louder. The Dutch governor of Elmina, [[Cornelis Nagtglas]], tried to persuade the Elminese to relinquish their city to the British. This was of course complicated by the presence of an Ashanti army in the town, which even arrested Nagtglas for a short while in April 1871. In February of that year, a [[Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870-1871|treaty had been signed with the United Kingdom]], under which terms the whole colony was to be ceded for a sum of 46,939.62 [[Dutch guilder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adhin|1961|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 1872, after ratification of the treaty by parliament, Elmina was formally handed over to Britain.

===Destruction of Elmina===
[[File:Elmina bombardment 1873.jpg|thumb|The bombardment of Elmina.]]
As was to be expected, the Ashanti were less pleased by the handover of Elmina to the Fante-allied British. Ashanti king [[Kofi Karikari]] posited that the "Elmina Note", which governed the tribute paid by the Dutch to the Ashanti, asserted Ashanti sovereignty over the town. In June 1873, the situation escalated when an Ashanti army marched to Elmina to "win back" the town from Britain. The [[Third Anglo-Ashanti War]] had started, and Britain began bombing Elmina on 13 June 1873. The old town of Elmina was completely destroyed and leveled to make room for a parade ground.

==Administration==

===Dutch West India Company===
During the reign of the Dutch West India Company, the government of the colony was headed by a [[Director-General]]. The Director-General was assisted by a Council composed of senior colonial officers. Aside from being the supreme ruler of the colony, the Director-General was also the supreme commander of the land and sea forces, and highest judicial officer.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|pp=258-263}} The Director-General had a double mandate, being installed by both the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] of the Dutch Republic and the Dutch West India Company.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|p=263-264, 303}} The colonial government was based at Fort Nassau in Moree between 1621 and 1637, and at Fort George in Elmina from 1637 onward.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|pp=258-263}}

When the Dutch [[Capture of Luanda|conquered Luanda]] and [[São Tomé]] from the Portuguese in 1642, the Dutch West India Company's possessions on the coast of Africa were divided into two separate commandments. The government at Elmina was charged with the rule over "Guinea and its dependencies from [[Cape Three Points|Cabo Tres Puntas]] to [[Cape Lopez|Cabo Lopes Gonsalves]]," and the government at Luanda with the possessions south of the latter cape, including São Tomé. The title of the Director-General at Elmina was changed to "Director-General of the North Coast of Africa." When the Dutch [[Recapture of Angola|lost Luanda]] to the Portuguese in 1648, Sao Tomé was shortly ruled from Elmina, until it was recaptured by the Portuguese as well in the same year.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|p=262}}

With the establishment of the Second Dutch West India Company in 1675, the government structure was revised. The area under the authority of the Director-General was redefined as "the Coast of Africa, from [[Sierra Leone]] all exclusively to [[30th parallel south|30 degrees South of the equator]], together with all the islands in between," thereby nominally reinstating the claim on the territories lost in this area to the Portuguese.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|p=262}} The title of the Director-General was concurrently changed to "Director-General of the North and South Coast of Africa." This larger claim was not primarily meant to reclaim Luanda and Sao Tomé from the Portuguese, however, but merely to establish authority over Dutch trade in the area. This was especially relevant for [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]], from which the Dutch began buying slaves in large amounts from the 1670s onward. Until the liquidation of the Dutch West India Company in 1791, the title of the Director-General and the limits of jurisdiction remained the same.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|pp=262-263}}

====Composition of the Council====
According to the 1722 government instruction, the Council comprised the Director-General, who functioned as the Council's president, the fiscal (Dutch: ''fiscaal''), the senior merchant (Dutch: ''opperkoopman''), and the senior commissioners (Dutch: ''oppercommies''). These senior commissioners consisted of the head of [[Fort Santo Antonio|Fort Saint Anthony]] at [[Axim]], the head of [[Fort Nassau (Ghana)|Fort Nassau]] at [[Moree, Ghana|Moree]], the head of [[Ussher Fort|Fort Crèvecoeur]] at [[Accra]], and the head of the factory at [[Ouidah]], on the [[Dutch Slave Coast]]. Between 1746 and 1768, the Council consisted of the Director-General, the fiscal, and the seven highest ranking "first officials", which included the senior commissioners, the master of works (Dutch: ''equipagemeester''), the [[Bookkeeping|bookkeeper-general]] (Dutch: ''boekhouder-generaal''), and the [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] (Dutch: ''vaandrig''). In 1768, the Council was again reduced to the fiscal, the three senior commissioners (the trading post at Ouidah has since been abandoned), and the commissioner-and councillor. The composition of the Council was changed for a final time in 1784, in the wake of the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], now extending the membership to include the bookkeeper-general-and-commissioner.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|p=264}}

===Direct Dutch rule===
After the liquidation of the Dutch West India Company in 1791, the Council of Colonies for the West Indies took over the government of the Dutch Gold Coast. Little changed in the first years, and the old administration of the Dutch West India Company was left largely intact.

This changed when the [[Batavian Republic]] replaced the Dutch Republic in 1795. The administration of the Dutch Gold Coast was reformed by a secret resolution of 12 May 1801. The office of Director-General was renamed [[Governor-General]], and the Council was split in a Great Council and a Small Council. The Small Council was responsible for the everyday government of the colony, and comprised the Governor-General, the administrator-and-Director-General (Dutch: ''administrateur en directeur-generaal''),{{ref|Director-General|Note 1}} the master of stores, the master of works, and the bookkeeper of the general office (Dutch: ''boekhouder ten comptoir-generaal''). The Great Council consisted of the Small Council, with the addition of the residents of Fort Crèvecoeur at Accra, Fort Saint Anthony at Axim, [[Fort San Sebastian|Fort Saint Sebastian]] at Shama, and [[Fort Amsterdam (Ghana)|Fort Amsterdam]] at Kormatin, and met every three months.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|pp=264-265}}

The administration of the Dutch Gold Coast was again reformed when the [[Kingdom of Holland]] replaced the Batavian Republic in 1806. By [[royal decree]] of [[Louis Napoleon]], King of Holland, the office of Governor-General was demoted to [[Commandant-General]] in 1807, and the administration was overhauled in 1809. An even bigger change came with the establishment of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815. Leaving behind the uncertain years of French occupation, and with slave trade abolished, the newly established kingdom put up a plan to transform the colony into a profitable plantation colony. For this purpose, the new governor [[Herman Willem Daendels]] was given an open mandate and a large budget. The project was cut short with Daendels early death in 1818, however.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|pp=265-266}}

Left without a visionary governor, budgets were cut for the colony. The new regulations of 1 November 1819 reduced the budget to the minimum necessary to keep the colony running, fired all unnecessary colonial officers, and pensioned of most of the slaves of the state. Most notably, the offices of bookkeeper, fiscal, secretary, cashier, and bailiff were combined into one office, the summation of functions actually being the office-holder's title (Dutch: ''boekhouder, fiscaal, secretaris, kassier en deurwaarder'').{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|p=273, 306}} Also, the office of Governor-General was demoted to [[Commander]]. When the Dutch decided to recruit soldiers for the Dutch East Indies Army in 1836, the government was strengthened again, something which was reinforced in the wake of the destastrous [[Ahanta War]] of 1838. By virtue of a royal decree dated 23 March 1838, the office of Commander was raised to Governor and extra officers were installed to make the government more effective.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|p=266}} The government itself was reformed in 1847, which among its most notable inventions included the establishment of a Court of Justice, legally separate from the Council, although memberships often overlapped.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|p=258, 262, 266, 274}} The office of fiscal, responsible for public prosecution, was renamed [[prosecutor|Officer of Justice]].{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|p=273}}

In the late 1850s, the administrative divisions into forts was changed into a division into districts (Dutch: ''afdelingen''), asserting Dutch sovereignty (or [[suzerainty]]) over not only the forts, but also the territory surrounding the forts.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|p=334}} District officers were instructed to make surveys of physical, economic, and socio-political situation of the districts.{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|p=334}} As a consequence of the tariff system set up in the [[Anglo-Dutch Gold Coast Treaty (1867)|Anglo-Dutch Gold Coast Treaty]], a tax and customs office was established in Elmina in 1867. At the same time, a postal office was established as well.{{sfn|Doortman|Smit|2007|p=273}}

==Economy==
[[File:Atlantic slavetrade estimates.png|thumb|right|Estimates of the Atlantic slave trade. The blue bar represents the number of slaves that boarded ships in Africa, the red bar the number that disembarked in America, the remainder having died during the voyage.]]
Although the colony is nowadays primarily associated with [[Atlantic slave trade]], this was not the reason for the first Dutch traders to trade with the Gold Coast. [[Barent Eriksz]] made a profit trading [[gold]], [[ivory]], and [[West African pepper]],&lt;ref name="Delepeleire 2004"/&gt; and these products remained the primary trading goods in the early 17th century. According to [[Joannes de Laet]], the Dutch West India had transported West-African goods worth 14 million [[Dutch guilder]]s to the Dutch Republic by 1637, of which the most important was the trade in gold.&lt;ref name="Delepeleire2c"&gt;{{harvnb|Delepeleire|2004}}, section 2.c.&lt;/ref&gt;

This changed with the [[Dutch Brazil|gradual capture of Brazil]] from the Portuguese, from 1630 onward. Suddenly, the trade of slaves, for which there was no significant market earlier, became a necessity for the economic survival of [[Dutch Brazil]].&lt;ref name="Delepeleire2c" /&gt; Nicolas van Yperen, Governor of the Dutch possessions on the Gold Coast, was instructed by his superiors of the Dutch West India Company to supply Dutch Brazil with slaves. In 1636, he managed to ship around a thousand slaves to Brazil from [[Fort Nassau (Ghana)|Fort Nassau]], but to secure a continuous flow of slave labour, the company decided it was necessary to attempt once more to capture Elmina from the Portuguese. After Elmina was finally [[Battle of Elmina (1637)|captured in August 1637]], the focus of trade for the Dutch West India Company shifted to slave trade.&lt;ref name="Delepeleire2c" /&gt; The directors of the Dutch West India Company were not happy with the increasing slave trade on the Gold Coast itself, however, as it interfered with the profitable gold trade, and actively tried to move the slave trade to the [[Dutch Slave Coast|Slave Coast]], where they had trading posts from 1640 onward.{{sfn|Postma|1990|pp=59, 95-96}}{{sfn|Van Kessel|2001}}

The loss of Brazil did not collapse Dutch slave trade, as in 1662, Dutch signed their first ''[[asiento]]'' with the Spanish Empire, pledging to provide slaves to [[Spanish America]], primarily through their trading post in [[Willemstad]], [[Curaçao]].&lt;ref name="Intermediair"&gt;{{cite news |title=De zwarte rand van de gouden eeuw |author=Bart Stol |url=http://www.intermediair.nl/artikel/weekblad-archief/28887/de-zwarte-rand-van-de-gouden-eeuw.html |newspaper= |date=2001-12-06 |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 1664, the Dutch conquered [[Suriname]], complementing [[Berbice]] and [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] as Caribbean plantation colonies depending on slave labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postma|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Dutch had tried in 1654 to directly control the mining of gold by building [[Fort Ruychaver]] far inland on the [[Ankobra River]], but had left gold production to the locals since that fort was attacked and burned to the ground in 1660. The supply of gold declined dramatically at the turn of the eighteenth century, due to tribal warfare among the people of the Gold Coast. While the Ashanti succeeded in the [[Battle of Feyiase]] of 1701 to establish their hegemony on the Gold Coast, it took them a few years to fully "pacify" their newly conquered territory.&lt;ref name="Delepeleire3c1"&gt;{{harvnb|Delepeleire|2004}}, section 3.c.1.&lt;/ref&gt; 1701 proved to be the historic low for the gold trade, with only 530 [[mark (unit)|mark]] of gold exported, worth 178.080 guilders.&lt;ref name="Delepeleire3c1" /&gt;

Whereas the supply of gold was declining, the supply of slaves boomed as never before. This was to a large part due to the Ashanti wars; Governor-General Willem de la Palma wrote to his superiors at the Dutch West India Company that the war had unleashed [[slave raid]]s among the local peoples in the Gold Coast. Whereas between 1693 and 1701 1,522 slaves were transported from Elmina to the Americas, an average of 169 slaves per year, 1,213 slaves were transported between 1702 and 1704, an average of 404 per year.&lt;ref name="Delepeleire3c2"&gt;{{harvnb|Delepeleire|2004}}, section 3.c.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from increased supply of slaves, the demand also increased due to the asiento trading with the Spanish. Between 1660 and 1690, the Dutch trading posts in Africa, which included the [[Dutch Slave Coast|Slave Coast]], [[Arguin]], and [[Senegambia (Dutch West India Company)|Senegambia]], shipped a third of the total number of slaves across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="Intermediair" /&gt; On the Gold Coast, Governor De la Palma actively tried to systemize the slave trade and improve the numbers of slave shipped to the Americas. To this purpuse, he sent [[Jacob van den Broucke]] as "opperkommies" (head merchant) to the Dutch trading post at [[Ouidah]], on the [[Dutch Slave Coast|Slave Coast]].&lt;ref name="Delepeleire3c2" /&gt;

De la Palma was a difficult personality and often at odds with his merchants and local African leaders. He resigned from his position in September 1705, but died before he could return to the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref name="Delepeleire3c2" /&gt; He was replaced by his deputy, Pieter Nuyts, who tried to revive the gold trade at the coast.&lt;ref name="Delepeleire3c3"&gt;{{harvnb|Delepeleire|2004}}, section 3.c.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

But by the beginning of the eighteenth century, even slave trade dwindled, with the Dutch becoming a rather small player in the trans-Atlantic trade. Since globally this trade peaked in the 18th century, this meant that the Dutch contribution to the Atlantic slave trade only amounts to 5% of the grand total, equalling around 500,000 slaves shipped from Africa to the Americas.&lt;ref name="Intermediair" /&gt;

In 1730, the monopoly of the Dutch West India Company on the Atlantic slave trade was lifted. This contributed to the rise of the [[Middelburgsche Commercie Compagnie]] (MCC), which dominated the Dutch slave trade for much of the eighteenth century.

===The Gold Coast economy in the 19th century===
With the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], the Dutch vowed to stop trading slaves. This meant a severe blow to the economy of the Gold Coast, which had increasingly relied on slave trade from the 18th century onwards. Attempts were made to establish a plantation colony and to open gold mines on the coast, but virtually all attempts proved failures.{{sfn|Nagtglas|1863|pp=6-11}}

One of the first attempts at establishing a plantation was made by the sons of Governor-General [[Herman Willem Daendels]] in 1816. They established a plantation named ''Oranje Dageraad'' in Simbo. The Governor-General himself tried to buy 300 slaves from [[Kumasi]], which were to regain their freedom by cultivating farmland. Both projects failed.{{sfn|Nagtglas|1863|pp=6-7}}&lt;ref name="Van der Meer 1.2"&gt;{{harvnb|Van der Meer|1990}}, chapter 2.8: Gouverneur Daendels: kolonisatie-plannen&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1845 and 1850, the colonial government once again, after the failure of [[Fort Ruychaver]], tried to establish a gold mine on the coast. The Dutch government bought an open-air gold mine from the chief of Butre, and sent in 1845 an expedition of a director, three engineers, and nine workers 
to the village of Dabokrom to establish a mine.{{sfn|Nagtglas|1863|p=7}}{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|p=291}} Two engineers and all nine workers fell victim to tropical diseases and died, leaving the rest of the expedition to return to Europe.{{sfn|Nagtglas|1863|p=7}} The second expedition of 1847 was not less successful, now with 11 out of 13 people dying. By 1850, the Dutch government ended the mining attempt.{{sfn|Nagtglas|1863|pp=7-8}}{{sfn|Doortmont|Smit|2007|p=291}}

Another attempt to develop the colony involved the establishment of a [[cotton plantation]] just outside Elmina. In light of this project, a Brazilian man by the name of La Rocha Vièra was brought to the Gold Coast. Due to the rude treatment of workers, La Rocha Vièra was unable to attract new labourers, and the plantation died an early death.{{sfn|Nagtglas|1863|p=8}} In 1848, a [[tobacco plantation]] was attempted in the government's garden in Elmina, but failed due to bad soil conditions.{{sfn|Nagtglas|1863|pp=8-9}} A more successful tobacco plantation was established in Simbo, but fell victim to a lack of labourers wanting to work on the plantation.{{sfn|Nagtglas|1863|p=9}} From February to October 1859, Dutch colonial government official [[J.S.G. Gramberg]] tried to develop the soil on the Bossumprah River, but also had difficulty attracting workers.{{sfn|Nagtglas|1863|pp=10-11}}

The only two plantations that were successful comprised a [[coffee plantation]] in [[Akropong]], established by missionaries from [[Basel]], and another coffee plantation in Mayra near [[Accra]], owned by [[mulatto]] entrepreneur Lutterodt, worked by slaves.{{sfn|Nagtglas|1863|p=11}}

==Society==
[[File:AMH-6780-NA Map of El Mina Fort.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Elmina around 1665 by Johannes Vingboons.]]
[[File:Bergeman - Elmina (1799).png|thumb|right|Map of Elmina around 1799 by J.C. Bergeman.]]
Until the destruction of Elmina in 1873, the town was the largest settlement on the Gold Coast, eclipsing [[Accra]] and [[Kumasi]]. In the 18th century, its population numbered 12,000 to 16,000 inhabitants, and in the 19th century, this figure rose to between 18,000 and 20,000.{{sfn|Yarak|2003}}{{sfn|Feinberg|1989|pp=85, 95}} Most of these inhabitants were not European, however; their number peaked at 377 Dutch West India Company employees for the entire Dutch Gold Coast in the 18th century, before sinking back to a mere 20 officers in the 19th century.{{sfn|DeCorse|2001|p=35f}}

Much more important were the African inhabitants of Elmina, who came from every region of the Gold Coast to Elmina to try their luck.{{sfn|Feinberg|1989|pp=81–85}} [[Slavery in Africa|Slaves]] formed a considerable portion of the population of Elmina as well, and were often in the possession of the [[Akan people]] inhabitants themselves. The third group in Elmina was of mixed race, and the result of interracial relations between Dutch West India Company employees and African women in Elmina. The illegitimate children of the employees were called "Tapoeijers" by the Dutch, for, according to them, the colour of their skin resembled those of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native American]]s. A decree from 1700 by the Governor-General at Elmina stipulated that employees of the Dutch West India Company who were to return to the Netherlands either had to take their (illegitimate) children with them, or had to pay a sum of money to provide for their "Christian upbringing".{{sfn|Van Dantzig|1999|p=60}}{{sfn|Feinberg|1989|p=123}} For the latter purpose, a school was established in Elmina.{{sfn|DeCorse|2001|p=37}}

Many people of mixed descent, also referred to as Euro-Africans, became wealthy merchants. The most prominent of these was [[Jan Niezer]], who visited Europe on several occasions, and who traded directly with European and American companies.

The fourth group in Elmina was also of mixed descent, but had a different status as "Vrijburghers" (free citizens). They had the same rights as Europeans, and were organized in a separate in so-called [[Asafo]] company known as "Akrampafo". Their [[burgemeester]] had the power to conclude treaties with the Dutch, and all Vrijburghers had the right to wear a sword.{{sfn|DeCorse|2001|p=37}} Well known Vrijburghers include [[Carel Hendrik Bartels]], [[Jacob Huidecoper]] and [[Jacob Simon]]. Many Vrijburghers worked in the lower ranks of the Dutch administration of Elmina, and in the 19th century, various Vrijburgher families sent their children (girls included) to Europe for education. In the 19th century, the Vrijburghers settled north of the Benya lagune, near [[Fort Coenraadsburg]]. This part of Elmina, also known as "the Garden" was spared from British bombardment in 1873.

===Two extraordinary Africans===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[File:Jacobus Capitein.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Jacobus Capitein.]]
The presence of European powers on the Gold Coast opened up the area to the outside world, and some Africans from the Gold Coast achieved a modicum of accomplishment in European society. Two Africans from the Gold Coast are especially notable in this regard, although one of them is notorious for defending slavery as compatible with Christianity.

[[Anton Wilhelm Amo]] was born near Axim in 1703 and sent to [[Amsterdam]] by the Dutch West India Company around 1707. He was given as a present to [[Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]]. Amo was baptised, went to school at the [[Wolfenbüttel Ritter-Akademie]] (1717–1721) the [[University of Helmstedt]] (1721–1727), and the [[University of Halle]] (1727–1729), and subsequently gained a doctorate in philosophy at the [[University of Wittenberg]] in 1734 with the thesis ''On the Absence of Sensation in the Human Mind and its Presence in our Organic and Living Body'', in which he argued against [[Cartesian dualism]] and in favour of a broadly materialist account of the person. In 1740, Amo took up a post in philosophy at the [[University of Jena]], but in 1747 he returned to the Gold Coast where he died in 1759. Amo was the first black person to attend a European university.  He lies interred in the graveyard of [[Fort San Sebastian]].

Around 1717 [[Jacobus Capitein]] was born in the Gold Coast. He was forcibly taken to the Netherlands in 1725, where he was given to Jacobus van Goch. Capitein excelled at school and announced during his baptism in 1735 that he wanted to return to the Gold Coast as a missionary. To that effect he studied at [[Leiden University]] between 1737 and 1742, graduating on a dissertation defending slavery. He was subsequently installed by the Dutch East India Company as a Christian minister at Elmina, where he married Antonia Ginderdros. [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] king [[Opoku Ware I]] demanded that Capitein teach his children, which he did. Capitein died in Elmina in 1747.

==Legacy==
After the [[Dutch East Indies]] gained independence as [[Indonesia]] in 1949, most [[Belanda Hitam]] migrated to the [[Netherlands]], since they had been soldiers of the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]]. Other than that, the Dutch colonial history on the Gold Coast was more or less forgotten. This changed slightly after [[Arthur Japin]] published the earlier mentioned ''The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi'' in 1997. This attention also revealed that the head of [[Ahanta people|Ahanta]] king [[Badu Bonsu II]], taken to the Netherlands after his execution in 1838, was still in the possession of the [[Leiden University Medical Centre]]. The head of the king was handed over to the Ghanaian ambassador in a ceremony held on 23 July 2009 in The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8165497.stm Dutch return head of Ghana king], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the 300 year anniversary of diplomatic ties between Ghana and the Netherlands was celebrated, with Dutch Crown Prince [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange|Willem-Alexander]] and his wife [[Princess Máxima of the Netherlands|Máxima]] visiting Ghana between 14 and 17 April, and with Ashanti king [[Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II]] visiting the Netherlands in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/nieuws/nieuwsberichten/2002/april/officieel-bezoek-prins-van-oranje-en-prinses-maxima-aan-ghana/ |title=Officieel bezoek Prins van Oranje en Prinses Máxima aan Ghana |author= |date=2002-04-14 |work= |publisher=Het Koninklijk Huis |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522115552/http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/nieuws/nieuwsberichten/2002/april/officieel-bezoek-prins-van-oranje-en-prinses-maxima-aan-ghana/ |archivedate=22 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kroonprinselijk paar sluit succesvol bezoek aan Ghana af |author=Mark Duursma |url=http://vorige.nrc.nl/krant/article1520773.ece |newspaper=NRC Handelsblad |date=2002-04-18 |accessdate=21 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424105431/http://vorige.nrc.nl/krant/article1520773.ece |archivedate=24 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anniversary referred to is the sending by the Dutch West India Company of [[David van Neyendael]] as envoy to the Ashanti Empire in 1701, after the Ashanti had become the dominant power on the Gold Coast by defeating the Denkyira at the [[Battle of Feyiase]].{{sfn|Van Kessel|2001}}

Remnants of Dutch presence in the Gold Coast, other than the forts along the coastline, are Dutch surnames which were taken on by the descendents of the children the Dutch slave traders had with their black mistresses. Bossman is a common surname in Ghana, and ultimately derives from the Dutch slave trader [[Willem Bosman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deslavernij.ntr.nl/2011/07/13/nazaat-van-een-nederlande-slavenhandelaar |title=Nazaat van een Nederlandse slavenhandelaar |author=Marcel Goedhart |date=2011-07-13 |work= |publisher=NTR |accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Ghanaian surnames derived from Dutch names include Bartels, Van Dyck, and De Veer.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Ministry of General Affairs - [http://english.minaz.nl/News/Speeches/2008/Oktober/Speech_Balkenende_at_a_government_lunch_on_occasion_of_state_visit_President_Kufuor_of_Ghana Speech Balkenende at a government lunch on occasion of state visit President Kufuor of Ghana]&lt;/ref&gt; In an episode of ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (British TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'', British-Ghanaian actor [[Hugh Quarshie]] traced his ancestry to Pieter Martinus Johannes Kamerling, a Dutch official on the Gold Coast.

In 1868, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands traded some forts in order to create more geographically contiguous areas of influence.&lt;ref name="FCOtrade" /&gt; The Netherlands ceded Fort Nassau, Fort Crêvecoeur, Fort Amsterdam, Fort Goede Hoop, and Fort Lijdzaamheid, and in return received Apollonia (renamed Fort Willem III), Fort Dixcove (renamed Fort Metalen Kruis), Fort Komenda (not to be confused with the already Dutch Fort Vredenburgh, also in Komenda), and Fort Sekondi (not to be confused with the already Dutch Fort Orange, also in Sekondi). This arrangement proved short-lived, as the colony was completely ceded to the United Kingdom in 1872.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="944">'''Full pond''' is an American phrase used to describe the water level of a [[lake]], [[reservoir]] or other body of fresh water when the level is just below the [[spillway]], or is otherwise at a maximum, sustainable and safe level.  

Technically, a body of water can have a water level higher than full pond when the inflow of water into the body greatly exceeds the outflow (such as during a heavy rain event), even if the body of water is not at full [[flood level]].  Most lakes and reservoirs have the ability to lower the level of the lake even when it is already significantly below full.  This is used for [[flood prevention]] during periods of high (or potentially high) inflow to prevent flooding and to prevent water from breaching containment when it is expected the body of water will soon exceed full pond status.

'''Lucene Geographic and Temporal''' ('''LGTE''') is an [[information retrieval]] tool developed at [[Technical University of Lisbon]] which can be used as a [[search engine]] or as evaluation system for information retrieval techniques for research purposes. The first implementation powered by LGTE was the search engine of [[DIGMAP]], a project co-funded by the community programme [[eContentplus]] between 2006 and 2008, which was aimed to provide services available on the web over old digitized maps from a group of partners over Europe including several National Libraries. 

The tool LGTE is built in Java Programming Language around the [[Lucene]] library for full-text search and introduces several extensions for dealing with geographical and temporal information. The package also includes utilities for information retrieval evaluation, such as classes for handling CLEF/TREC (Cross Language Evaluation Forúm/Text Retrieval Conference) topics and document collections. 

Technically LGTE is a layer on the top of Lucene and provides an extended Lucene API to integrate several services like snippets generation, [[query expansion]], and many others. The LGTE provides the chance to implement new probabilistic models. The API depends on a set of modifications at the Lucene level, originally created by the researchers of the University of Amsterdam in a software tool named Lucene-lm developed by the group of Information and Language Processing Systems (ILPS). At the time, the tool was tested with success for the Okapi BM25 model, and a multinomial language model, but also includes divergence from randomness models. 

The LGTE 1.1.9 and later versions also provide the possibility to isolate the index fields in different index folders. Another recent feature is the configuration of Hierarchic Indexes using foreign key fields. This gives the chance to create scores for example based on the text of the sentence combined with the general score of the entire page.

==Features==
* Provides Isolated Fields using different folders
* Provides Hierarchic indexes through foreign key fields
* Provides classes to parse documents using Yahoo PlaceMaker
* Provides a simple and effective abstraction layer on top of Lucene
* Supports integrated retrieval and ranking with basis on thematic, temporal and geographical aspects.
* Supports the Lucene standard retrieval model, as well as the more advanced probabilistic retrieval approaches.
* Supports [[Rochio Query Expansion]].
* Provides a framework for IR evaluation experiments (e.g. handling CLEF/TREC topics).
* Includes a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] alternative to the trec_eval tool, capable of performing significance tests over pairs of runs.
* Includes a simple test application for searching over the Braun Corpus or the Cranfield Corpus.

This is a '''list of [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries by [[gross domestic product]] at [[purchasing power parity]]''' (PPP). Gross domestic product is the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. The GDP dollar estimates presented here are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Values are given in millions of [[United States dollar|US dollars]]. Dependent territories are shown in italics and are not ranked, and their flags are shown alongside the country of which they are a territory.

The table below shows the latest PPP and PPP [[per capita]] data for Commonwealth countries and territories of the member countries. Most figures (including for the [[world]]) are 2017 data from the [[International Monetary Fund]], and are shown in [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international dollars]]. Other figures are estimates from ''[[The World Factbook]]'' of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (for GDP&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html Field listing - GDP (PPP exchange rate)], [[CIA World Factbook]]&lt;/ref&gt; and GDP per capita&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html GDP – per capita (PPP)], [[The World Factbook]], Central Intelligence Agency. Accessed on 5 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;), and are noted beside the figures along with the year of estimate. 

Click on one of the small triangles in the headings to re-order the list according to that category.

Note: The figures for the dependent territories are slightly outdated (e.g. the GDP per capita figure for the Cayman Islands is from 2004), therefore they may not be easily compared with more recent figures for sovereign states.

From 1936, the colony of Eritrea was increased in size and called [[Eritrea Governorate]], as part of [[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]] (AOI). The Italian governors were under direct orders of the [[List of Governors-General of Italian East Africa|Viceroy]] (representing the now-[[King of Italy|King]] and [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele III]]).

====Cities and regions====
{{see also|List of cities in Azerbaijan}}
;[[Absheron Rayon]]
;[[Astara, Azerbaijan|Astara]] and [[Astara (rayon)]]: There are two main theories for the etymology of the city's name. One is that it is derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Talysh language|Talysh]] word '''آهسته رو''' (Aste-ro or Aheste-ro), meaning "the place where the travel gets slower" (given the marshlands that surrounded the region before). [https://web.archive.org/web/20061215000828/http://www.iau-astara.ac.ir/main%20menu.htm]. The oldest theory comes from Vedic songs and writings which explains Astara as a place where the rays of lights shine from behind to light the pathways ahead.
;[[Babek (rayon)|Babək rayon]]: Named after the Iranian hero [[Babak Khorramdin]]
;[[Baku]]: The name Baku is widely believed to be derived from the old [[Persian Language|Persian]] names of the city ''Bad-kube'', meaning "city where the wind blows", or ''Baghkuh'', meaning "Mount of God". [[Arabic]] sources refer the city as ''Baku'', ''Bakukh'', ''Bakuya'', and ''Bakuye'', all of which seem to come from the original Persian name. Other theories suggest that the name dates back to [[Zoroastrianism]] and comes from the word ''Baga'' meaning "the god" in Avestan and Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window2baku.com/eng/9002toponimbaku.htm On the Etymology of the Name “Baku”] Retrieved on July 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travel-images.com/az-baku.html Baku (Baki)] Retrieved on July 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|List of cities in Iran}}
;[[Abadan]]: An Iranian etymology of the name (from the Persian word "ab" (water) and the root "pā" (guard, watch) thus "coastguard station"), was suggested by ''B. Farahvashi''. Supporting evidence is the name "Apphana" which [[Ptolemy]] applies to an island off the mouth of the Tigris. The Persian version of the name had begun to come into general use before it was adopted by official decree in 1935.&lt;ref name="ei"&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/articles/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home1/iranica/articles/v1_articles/abadan&amp;OptStrLogFile=/home/iranica/public_html/logs/pdfdownload.html Abadan], in [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], pp.51-52&lt;/ref&gt; The geographer Marcian also renders the name "Apphadana" in his writings.&lt;ref&gt;''Geographia Marciani Heracleotae'', ed. [[David Hoeschel]], Augsburg 1600 p48&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Ahvaz]]: The word ''Ahvaz'' is a Persianized form of the local Arabic ''Ahwaz'', which in turn itself is derived from a Persian word. The [[Dehkhoda Dictionary]] specifically defines the Arabic "Suq-al-Ahwaz" as "Market of the Khuzis", where "Suq" is Arabic for market, and "Ahwaz" is a plural (اسم جمع) of the form "af'āl" (افعال) of the word "Huz", or more precisely, the Arabic root "ha wa za" (ه و ز), which itself comes from the Persian ''Huz'', from Achaemenid inscriptions from where the term first appears. Thus, "Ahwaz" in Arabic means "the Huz-i people", which refers to the non-Arabic original inhabitants of Khūzestān.
;[[Aligoodarz]]: The city of Aligoodarz was once called Al-e Goodarz meaning "sons or tribe of [[Goodarz]]", a mythical [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] hero from the Persian national epic [[Shahnameh]].

;[[Ardakan]]: The word "Ardakan" in [[Persian language|Persian]] means "holy place" or "clean place" ([[Modern Persian]]: ''ardak+an'' / [[Middle Persian]]: ''artak+an'')
;[[Astara, Iran|Astara]]: The city's name is derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word '''آهسته‌رو''' (Aste-ro or Aheste-ro), meaning "the place where the travel gets slower" (given the marshlands that surrounded the region before). [https://web.archive.org/web/20061215000828/http://www.iau-astara.ac.ir/main%20menu.htm].

It is not intended to include songs where Miami is simply "name-checked" along with various other cities.

*''[Because Wikipedia is in written rather than audio format, the lyrics and music are usually the most relevant element of each song; so, when adding or editing a song, please list its lyricist(s) and composer(s) if known. When different artists perform what is substantially the same song, please see if there is an existing listing to which other performers can be added, before starting a new listing. Otherwise this list will become unreadably long, while failing to let readers know which songs with the same title (e.g. "New York, New York") are related and which ones are completely different from each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, only include songs by notable artists, otherwise this list will become unreadably long. Please try to keep this list in alphabetical order. ]''

[[Image:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|The 15 major plates]]
[[Image:Plate tectonics map.gif|thumb|Plate tectonics map from NASA]]

This is a '''list of tectonic plates''' on the Earth's surface. [[Plate tectonics|Tectonic plates]] are pieces of [[Earth's crust]] and uppermost [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], together referred to as the [[lithosphere]]. The plates are around {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick and consist of two principal types of material: [[oceanic crust]] (also called ''[[Sima (geology)|sima]]'' from [[silicon]] and [[magnesium]]) and [[continental crust]] (''[[sial]]'' from silicon and [[aluminium]]). The composition of the two types of crust differs markedly, with  [[mafic]] [[basalt]]ic rocks dominating oceanic crust, while continental crust consists principally of lower-[[density]] [[felsic]] [[granite|granitic]] rocks.

==Current plates==
Geologists generally agree that the following tectonic plates currently exist on the Earth's surface with roughly definable boundaries. Tectonic plates are sometimes subdivided into three fairly arbitrary categories: ''major'' (or ''primary'') ''plates'', ''minor'' (or ''secondary'') ''plates'', and ''microplates'' (or ''tertiary plates'').

===Major/main plates===
These plates comprise the bulk of the continents and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. For purposes of this list, a '''major plate''' is any plate with an area greater than 20 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* {{annotated link|Pacific Plate}} – 103,300,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|North American Plate}} – 75,900,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|Eurasian Plate}} –  67,800,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|African Plate}} – 61,300,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|Antarctic Plate}} – 60,900,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|Indo-Australian Plate}} – 58,900,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; often considered two plates:
** {{annotated link|Australian Plate}} – 47,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
** {{annotated link|Indian Plate}} – 11,900,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|South American Plate}} – 43,600,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

===Minor plates===
These smaller plates are often not shown on major plate maps, as the majority do not comprise significant land area. For purposes of this list, a '''minor plate''' is any plate with an area less than 20 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but greater than 1 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* {{annotated link|Somali Plate}} – 16,700,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|Nazca Plate}} – 15,600,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|Philippine Sea Plate}} – 5,500,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|Arabian Plate}} – 5,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|Caribbean Plate}} – 3,300,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|Cocos Plate}} – 2,900,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|Caroline Plate}} – 1,700,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|Scotia Plate}} – 1,600,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|Burma Plate}} – 1,100,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{annotated link|New Hebrides Plate}} – 1,100,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

===Microplates===
These plates are often grouped with an adjacent major plate on a major plate map. For purposes of this list, a microplate is any plate with an area less than 1 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Some models identify more minor plates within current [[Orogeny|orogens]] (events that lead to a large structural deformation of the Earth's lithosphere) like the Apulian, Explorer, Gorda, and Philippine Mobile Belt plates.  There may be scientific consensus as to whether such plates should be considered distinct portions of the crust; thus new research could change this list.&lt;ref&gt;Tetsuzo Seno, Taro Sakurai, and Seth Stein. 1996.

==Ancient continental formations==
In the history of Earth many tectonic plates have come into existence and have over the intervening years either accreted onto other plates to form larger plates, rifted into smaller plates, or have been crushed by or subducted under other plates (or have done all three).

=== Ancient supercontinents ===
{{annotated link|Supercontinent}}
* {{annotated link|List of supercontinents}}
* {{annotated link|Supercontinent cycle}}
The following list includes the supercontinents known or speculated to have existed in the Earth's past:
* {{annotated link|Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia}}
* {{annotated link|Euramerica}}
* {{annotated link|Gondwana}}
* {{annotated link|Kenorland}}
* {{annotated link|Laurasia}}
* {{annotated link|Nena (supercontinent)|Nena}}
* {{annotated link|Pangaea}}
* {{annotated link|Pannotia}}
* {{annotated link|Proto-Laurasia}}
* {{annotated link|Rodinia}}
* {{annotated link|Ur (continent)|Ur}}
* {{annotated link|Vaalbara}}

=== Ancient plates and cratons ===
Not all plate boundaries are easily defined, especially for ancient pieces of crust. The following list of ancient [[craton]]s, [[microplate (geology)|microplates]], [[tectonic plate|plates]], [[shield (geology)|shields]], [[terranes]], and [[zone (geology)|zones]] no longer exist as separate plates. ''Cratons'' are the oldest and most stable parts of the continental lithosphere and ''shields'' are the exposed area of a craton(s). ''Microplates'' are tiny tectonic plates, ''terranes'' are fragments of crustal material formed on one tectonic plate and accreted to crust lying on another plate, and ''zones'' are bands of similar rocks on a plate formed by terrane accretion or native rock formation. Terranes may or may not have originated as independent microplates: a terrane may not contain the full thickness of the lithosphere.

'''Makran''' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|'''مکران'''}}}}, {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''مکران'''}}}}) is a semi-desert coastal strip in [[Balochistan]], in [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]], along the coast of the [[Gulf of Oman]].

==Etymology==
The southern part of Balochistan is called ''Kech Makran'' on Pakistani side and Makran on the Iranian side which is also the name of a former Iranian province.&lt;ref name="Makran"&gt;{{cite web|title=Makran|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Makran-region-Asia|website=www.britannica.com|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, in [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] times, the name ''[[Maka (satrapy)|Maka]]'' was used for the region. The Sumerian trading partners of [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] are identified with Makran.{{sfn|Hansman|1973|p=555}} In [[Varahamihira]]'s [[Brihat Samhita]], there is a mention of a tribe called ''Makara'' inhabiting the lands west of India. [[Arrian]] used the term ''[[Ichthyophagoi|Ichthyophagi]]'' (Ancient Greek for "fish eaters") for inhabitants of coastal areas, which has led to a suggestion to derive ''Makran'' from the Modern Persian term ''māhī khorān'', meaning "fish eaters", but this derivation is considered "erroneous".&lt;ref name="PoloYule1993"&gt;{{citation |editor1-last=Yule |editor1-first=Sir Henry |editor2-last=Cordier |editor2-first=Henri |title=The Travels of Marco Polo: The Complete Yule-Cordier Edition, Volume II |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TexF3FC87YC&amp;pg=PA402 |year=1993 |origyear=first published 1903, revised 1920 |publisher=Courier Corporation |isbn=978-0-486-27587-1 |pages=402–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achaemenid era== 
[[File:Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent according to Oxford Atlas of World History 2002.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Achaemenid empire at its greatest extent, including the region of Maka ([[Gedrosia]] in Greek terminology)]]
Maka was an important early eastern satrapy of [[Cyrus the Great]], founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The [[Babylonians]] had made voyages using Maka to communicate with India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/max-duncker/the-history-of-antiquity-volume-3-cnu/page-28-the-history-of-antiquity-volume-3-cnu.shtml |title=The history of antiquity|publisher=Max Duncker |date=|accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Cyrus' death, [[Darius I of Persia]] succeeded his throne, and, according to Greek historian [[Herodotus]], wanted to know more about [[Asia]]. He wished to know where the "Indus (which is the only river save one that produces crocodiles) emptied itself into the sea".&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.4.iv.html |title=History of Herodotus by Herodotus – Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) |publisher=mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After personally leading his [[Persian Immortals|elite forces]], whose ranks were restricted to those with [[Persian people|Persian]], [[Medes|Mede]], or [[Elamites|Elamite]] ancestry, to fight the invading [[Scythians]], he led a campaign of conquest towards [[South Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/empire2/unkemptgoose/Persian.html |title=Persia |publisher=Angelfire.com |date=|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/provinces/21_sistan_baluchistan/21_sistan_baluchistan.php |title=Iranian Provinces: Sistan and Baluchistan |publisher=Iranchamber.com |date=|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientpersia.com/war/immortal.htm |title=Ancient Persia |publisher=Ancientpersia.com |date=|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; conquering [[Sindh]] in 519 BC and constituting it as his 20th [[satrapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.mdc.edu/jmcnair/Joe12pages/darius_the_great.htm |title=Darius the great |publisher=mdc.edu |date=|accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axehd.com/Home/2010/05/04/the-largest-empire-in-ancient-history/|title=The largest empire in ancient history |publisher=axehd.com |date=|accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, [[Alexander the Great]] also crossed Maka in his campaign of conquest. His army marched through a harsh desert path in Makran, where he lost a significant number of soldiers due to the harsh desert conditions.

Herodotus on several occasions mentions the contributions of the "Mykians", who inhabited the eastern portion of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/herodotussevent02macagoog/herodotussevent02macagoog_djvu.txt |title=Full Text of Herodotus, Book 7,8 and 9 |publisher=archive.org |date=|accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are mentioned as "the men from Maka" in daiva inscriptions. The "Daiva inscription" is one of the most important of all [[Achaemenid]] inscriptions. The Mykians served in the army of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes the Great]] at the battle of [[Thermopylae]]. They are also thought to be responsible for inventions such as [[qanat]]s and underground drainage galleries that bring water from an aquifer on the piedmont to gardens or palm groves on the plains. These inventions were very important reasons behind the success of the empire. The Mykians of the other side of ancient Maka, the present day region of Balochistan and Sindh, are thought to have later become independent, as they are not mentioned in [[Arrian of Nicomedia]]'s account of the campaigns of [[Alexander the Great]]; he  mentions only the Omani side of Maka, which he calls "Maketa". The reasons for this may have been the arguably unjust rule of Xerxes.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/herodotus/h4/book7.html |title=The History, by Herodotus (book7)|publisher=cadelaide.edu.au |date=|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/maa-mam/maka/maka.html |title=Maka|publisher=livius.org|date=|accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism and Hinduism in the eastern parts in the seventh century==

Abū Rayḥān Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad [[Al-Bīrūnī]], states in his book ''India'' that the [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/pages/ldpd_5949073_001_00000264.html?toggle=image&amp;menu=maximize&amp;top=&amp;left= coast of India begins with Tiz], the capital of Makran.

According to historian [[Andre Wink]]:
{{bquote|Further evidence in the [[Chach Nama|Chachnama]] makes perfectly clear that many areas of Makran as of [[Sindh]] had a largely [[Buddhist]] population. When [[Chach of Alor|Chach]] marched to Armabil, this town is described as having been in the hands of a Buddhist Samani (Samani Budda), a descendent of the agents of Rai Sahiras who had been elevated for their loyalty and devotion, but who later made themselves independent. The Buddhist chief offered his alligience to Chach when the latter was on his way to Kirman in 631. The same chiefdom of Armadil is referred to by [[Xuanzang|Huen Tsang]] 0-Tien -p-o-chi-lo, located at the high road running through Makran, and he also describes it as predominantly Buddhist, thinly populated though it was, it had no less than 80 Buddhist convents with about 5000 monks. In effect at eighteen km north west of Las Bela at Gandakahar, near the ruins of an ancient town are the [[Shehr-e-Roghan|caves of Gondrani]], and as their constructions show these caves were undoubtedly Buddhist. Traveling through the Kij valley further west (then under the government of Persia) Huien Tsang saw some 100 Buddhist monasteries and 6000 priests. He also saw several hundred [[Deva (Buddhism)|Deva]] temples in this part of Makran, and in the town of Su-nu li-chi-shi-fa-lo-which is probably Qasrqand- he saw a temple of [[Shiva|Maheshvara]] Deva, richly adorned and sculptured. There is thus very wide extension of Indian cultural forms in Makran in the seventh century, even in the period when it fell under Persian sovereignty. By comparison in more recent times the last place of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] pilgrimage in Makran was [[Hinglaj]], 256 km west of present day Karachi in [[Lasbela District|Las Bela]].&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Hind: Early medieval India and the expansion of Islam, 7th–11th centuries'' by André Wink page 135&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wink has recorded [[Xuanzang|Hiuen Tsang]]'s notings on the language and script in use in easternmost Makran (eastern parts of Pakistani Balochistan and Sindh):
[[File:MacedonEmpire-2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|alt=Baluch and alexandar's empire|Paths that [[Alexander the Great]] took]]

{{quote|Hiuen Tsang considered the script which was in use in Makran to be 'much the same as India', but the spoken language 'differed a little from that of India.'&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hind: Early medieval India and the expansion of Islam, 7th–11th centuries By André Wink Page 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Islamic conquest===
[[File:Centralmakran.jpg|thumb|200px|Central Makran range]]
The first Islamic conquest of Makran took place during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in the year 643 A.D. Caliph [[Umar]]’s governor of [[Bahrain]], Usman ibn Abu al-Aas, who was on a campaign to conquer the southern coastal areas beyond Sassanid, sent his brother Hakam ibn Abu al-Aas to raid and reconnoitre the Makran region.&lt;ref&gt;Al Baldiah wal nahaiyah vol: 7 page 141&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 644 AD Caliph [[Umar]] dispatched an army under the command of Hakam ibn Amr for the wholesale invasion of Makkuran. He was joined by reinforcements from [[Kufa]] under the command of Shahab ibn Makharaq, and by Abdullah ibn Utban, the commander of a campaign in [[Kerman]]. They encountered no strong resistance in Makran until the army of the King of [[Rai dynasty|Rai]], along with contingents from Makran and Sind, stopped them near the [[Indus|Indus River]]. In mid-644 the [[Battle of Rasil]] was fought between the forces of the Rashidun Caliphate and the Rai Kingdom; the Raja's forces were defeated and forced to retreat to the eastern bank of the Indus. The Raja’s army had included [[war elephant]]s, but these had posed little problem for the Muslim invaders, who had dealt with them during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquest of Persia]]. In accordance with the orders of Caliph [[Umar]], the captured war elephants were sold in Islamic Persia, with the proceeds distributed among the soldiers as share in booty.&lt;ref&gt;''Tarikh al Tabri'', vol: 4 page no: 180&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Caliph [[Umar]]’s questions about the Makran region, the messenger from Makkuran who brought the news of the victory told him:

{{quote|
O Commander of the faithful! 
It's a land where the plains are stony; 
Where water is scanty; 
Where the fruits are unsavory; 
Where men are known for treachery; 
Where plenty is unknown; 
Where virtue is held of little account; 
And where evil is dominant.
A large army is less for there;
And a less army is use less there;
The land beyond it, is even worse [referring to Sind]}}

Umar looked at the messenger and said: 
"Are you a messenger or a poet?" He replied, "Messenger". 
Thereupon Caliph [[Umar]] instructed Hakim bin Amr al Taghlabi that for the time being Makkuran should be the easternmost frontier of the Islamic empire, and that no further attempt should be made to extend the conquests.

Makran remained part of the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] [[Caliphate]], and was also ruled by Muslim Turks, Persian. It was conquered by Mongols in the 13th century AD but failed later, and in the 18th century the Baluch Nawab had agreed for governing the Makran region with mutual interest between both sides, as the British failed to conquer the area by force.

===Balochi attack on Mahmud Ghazni===
Baloch raiders plundered [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]'s ambassador between Tabbas and Khabis. In revenge, his son Masud defeated them at the latter place, which lies at the foot of the Karman Mountains on the edge of the desert.
&lt;ref&gt;Denzil Ibbetson, Edward MacLagan, H.A. Rose "A Glossary of The Tribes &amp; Casts of The Punjab &amp; North-West Frontier Province", 1911 AD, Page 43, Vol II,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
[[File:Map of Baluchistan from The Imperial Gazetteer of India (1907-1909).jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Baluchistan Agency]]]]
From the 15th century onward, the area was ruled by the [[Rind (tribe)|Rind tribe]] which was headed by [[Mir Chakar Rind]] later by [[Hooth|Hooth Dynasty In Makran]] Which led by Hooths and Khosags,  [[Buledis]], [[Noesherwani]], [[Ghichkis]] and in small particular  part govern by [[Gorgeig]] and [[Sardarzahi]]. In the late 18th century, the [[Khan of Kalat]] is said to have granted sanctuary at [[Gwadar]] to one of the claimants for the throne of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]]. When that claimant became [[Sultan]], he kept hold of Gwadar, installing a governor, who eventually led an army to conquer the city of [[Chabahar]] some 200 kilometres to the west.

The sultanate held onto the Makran coast throughout the period of British colonial rule, but eventually only Gwadar was left in the hands of the sultan. On the independence of [[Pakistan]], Makran became a district within the province of Balochistan, minus an area of 800&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; around Gwadar. The enclave was finally transferred in 1958 to Pakistani control as part of the district of Makran. The entire region has been subdivided into new smaller districts over the years.


==Geography==
[[File:Gwadar Beach.jpg|thumb|right|220px|alt=Gwadar in Makran|[[Gwadar]] beach in Makran region-today the economy of Makrani Baloch is largely based on use of the ocean.]]
The narrow coastal plain rises rapidly into several mountain ranges. Of the {{convert|1,000|km}} coastline, around {{convert|750|km}} is in [[Pakistan]].  The climate is dry with little rainfall. Makran is very sparsely inhabited, with much of the population concentrated in a string of small ports including [[Chabahar]], [[Gwatar]], [[Jiwani]], [[Jask]], [[Sirik, Iran|Sirik]], [[Gwadar]] (not to be confused with Gwatar), [[Pasni City|Pasni]], [[Ormara]] and many smaller fishing villages.

There is only one island off the coast of Makran, [[Astola|Astola Island]], near [[Pasni City|Pasni]] although there are several small islets. The coastline can be divided into an eastern lagoon coastline and a western embayed coastline. The main lagoons are [[Miani Hor]] and [[Kalamat Hor]]. The main bays of the embayed coast are [[Gwadar Bay]] and [[Gwatar Bay]]. This latter bay shelters a large [[mangrove]] forest and the nesting grounds of endangered turtle species. The [[Mirani Dam]] provides irrigation, flood prevention and water supply to [[Gwadar]] city.

'''Mbalam''' is a place in [[Cameroon]] near the southern border with the [[Republic of the Congo]] where there are significant deposits of iron ore.  The mining company is [[Sundance Resources Limited]].

== Namesakes ==
There are two other places in Cameroon with the same name.

== Railway ==
A 510&amp;nbsp;km railway connection to a [[list of deepwater ports|deepwater]] port is required to exploit these ore deposits efficiently. Several routes were planned using [[Quantm]] software. The railway will start at an elevation of about 650m at the mine, proceed along a fairly level alignment for 350&amp;nbsp;km, drops steeply for 100&amp;nbsp;km down to the coastal plain, then traverses that plain for 50&amp;nbsp;km to the port.&lt;ref&gt;http://imagesignal.comsec.com.au/asxdata/20071026/pdf/00774678.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The gradients generally favour loaded trains.

In September 2010, Sundance Resources signed a memorandum of understanding with [[CRCC China-Africa Construction Ltd]], which outlined construction plans for a 490&amp;nbsp;km railway linking the planned iron ore mines to a proposed port near [[Lolabé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/mbalam-ore-railway-scoping-study-agreed.html

|title=Railway Gazette: Mbalam ore railway scoping study agreed
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Chinese company, [[China Harbour Engineering Co Ltd]] (CHEC), will build the port.

A two-stage development of a mine, railway and port for the cross-border iron ore deposits in [[Cameroon]] and [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]] is estimated to cost US$7.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sydney Morning Herald]] 7 April 2011, pB4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traffic ==

The new railway is expected to carry 35 million tonnes of ore per year for 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miningweekly.com/article/sundance-signs-rail-deal-with-chinese-firm-for-mbalam-project-2010-09-08&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Catherine''' ({{lang-ar|جبل كاثرين}}), locally known as '''Gabal Katrîne''', is the highest mountain in [[Egypt]]. It is located near the city of [[Saint Catherine, Egypt|Saint Catherine]] in the [[South Sinai Governorate]].

[[File:Mountain and stars.jpg|thumb|Mount Catherine rocks]]
The name is derived from the Christian tradition that angels transported to this mountain the body of the martyred Saint [[Catherine of Alexandria]].

'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or [[universe]]. "Nature" can refer to the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of [[science]]. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word ''nature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''natura'', or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".&lt;ref name="etymonline-nature"&gt;{{OEtymD|nature|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natura'' is a Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard (2006) ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302–3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see earlier note.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [[universe]], is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "[[natural philosophy]]", akin to "systematic study of nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word "physical" shows its use as a synonym for "natural" in about the mid-15th century: {{OEtymD|physical|accessdate=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and [[wildlife]]. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the [[Earth]]. It is often taken to mean the "[[natural environment]]" or [[wilderness]]—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [[consciousness]] or a human [[mind]]. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the [[Wikt:unnatural|unnatural]] or the [[supernatural]].

Earth is the only [[planet]] known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the [[solar system]], it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest [[terrestrial planet]] and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial tropical to [[subtropical]] region.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several gradually migrating [[tectonic plate]]s. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]]. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

The [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = September 11, 2005|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050911103921.htm|title = Calculations favor reducing atmosphere for early Earth|work=[[Science Daily]]|accessdate = January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by [[latitude]] and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/pastcc.html|title = Past Climate Change|publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate = January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hugh Anderson|author2=Bernard Walter|date = March 28, 1997|url = http://vathena.arc.nasa.gov/curric/land/global/climchng.html |title = History of Climate Change|publisher = NASA|accessdate = January 7, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080123130745/http://vathena.arc.nasa.gov/curric/land/global/climchng.html |archivedate = January 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Weart|first = Spencer|date=June 2006|url = http://www.aip.org/history/climate/|title = The Discovery of Global Warming|publisher = American Institute of Physics|accessdate = January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology}}
Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the [[Earth]]. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [[structural geology|structure]], [[Physical property|physical properties]], dynamics, and [[History of the Earth|history]] of [[Earth materials]], and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [[academic discipline]], and is also important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [[natural hazard]]s, some [[Geotechnical engineering]] fields, and understanding [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] and environments.

====Geological evolution====
[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Three types of geological [[plate tectonic]] boundaries.]]
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] onto the surface or intrude into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when [[sediment]]s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into [[sedimentary rock]], or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava]] flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [[intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and [[transform boundary|transform boundaries]], respectively, between [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly 750&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] which broke apart about 540&amp;nbsp;million years ago, then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart about 180&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.B. |last=Murphy |author2=R.D.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]] era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in [[glacier]]s and ice sheets. This hypothesis has been termed the "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Kirschvink |date=1992 |chapter=Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth |chapterurl=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/firstsnowball.pdf |title=The Proterozoic Biosphere |editor=J.W.

Over the past 66&amp;nbsp;million years, mammalian life diversified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author2=Dorian Sagan |date=1995 |title=What is Life? |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0684813264 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several million years ago, a species of small African [[ape]] gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="Margulis1995" /&gt; The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [[civilization]] allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], produced by the proliferation of [[algae]] during the [[Siderian]] period, required about 300&amp;nbsp;million years to culminate.

The present era is classified as part of a mass [[extinction event]], the [[Holocene extinction]] event, the fastest ever to have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Diamond J|title = The present, past and future of human-caused extinctions|journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|volume = 325|issue = 1228|pages = 469–76; discussion 476–77|date = 1989|pmid = 2574887|doi = 10.1098/rstb.1989.0100|last2 = Ashmole|first2 = N.

==Atmosphere, climate, and weather==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|[[Rayleigh scattering|Blue light is scattered more]] than other wavelengths by the gases in the [[atmosphere]], giving the Earth a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space]]
{{Main|Atmosphere of Earth|Climate|Weather}}
The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the [[Nature#Ecosystems|ecosystem]]. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[water vapor]], with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The [[ozone layer]] plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|last=Miller|first=G.|last2=Spoolman|first2=Scott|date=September 28, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495383376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [[polar region]]s much colder.

Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.
[[File:Dszpics1.jpg|thumb|A tornado in central [[Oklahoma]]]]
The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is limited to only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Harvey|last2=Davidson|first2=Noel|date=May 25, 2015|title=Trends in the skill of weather prediction at lead times of 1–14 days|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=141|issue=692|pages=2726–36|via=Wiley|doi=10.1002/qj.2559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change|publisher=Science Daily|date=April 6, 2001|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water on Earth==
[[File:44 - Iguazu - Décembre 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Iguazu Falls]] on the border between [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]]]
{{Main|Water}}
'''Water''' is a [[chemical substance]] that is composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] and is vital for all known forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/background.html |title=Water for Life |publisher=Un.org |date=March 22, 2005 |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In typical usage, ''water'' refers only to its liquid form or [[States of matter|state]], but the substance also has a solid state, [[ice]], and a [[gas]]eous state, [[water vapor]], or [[steam]]. &lt;!--About 1.460 [[Tonne#Multiples|petatonnes]]&amp;nbsp;(Pt) (10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of water--&gt;Water covers 71% of the [[Earth]]'s surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|title=World|work=CIA – World Fact Book|accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in [[aquifer]]s and 0.001% in the [[atmosphere|air]] as [[vapor]], clouds, and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070320034158/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html Water Vapor in the Climate System], Special Report, American Geophysical Union, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080220070111/http://www.unep.org/dewa/assessments/ecosystems/water/vitalwater/ Vital Water]. [[UNEP]].&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans hold 97% of surface water, [[glacier]]s, and polar [[ice cap]]s 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

===Oceans===
[[File:Ocean from Leblon.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Atlantic Ocean from [[Leblon]], Rio de Janeiro.]]
{{Main|Ocean}}
An ocean is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia.'' 2002. New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103749/http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}". [http://www.oceansatlas.com/ UN Atlas of the Oceans]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spilhaus | first1 = Athelstan F | year = 1942 | title = Maps of the whole world ocean | url = | journal = Geographical Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 431–35 | doi=10.2307/210385| jstor = 210385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the [[Southern Ocean]], and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, [[Headlands and bays|gulfs]], [[bay]]s and other names. There are also [[salt lake]]s, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the [[Aral Sea]] and the [[Great Salt Lake]].

===Lakes===
[[File:Lake mapourika NZ.jpeg|thumb|[[Lake Mapourika]], New Zealand]]
{{Main|Lake}}
A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]] (or [[physical feature]]), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]] (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328083/lake
|author=Britannica Online
|accessdate=June 25, 2008
|title=Lake (physical feature)
|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not well established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Definition|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lake|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of [[ethane]], most likely mixed with [[methane]]. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

====Ponds====
[[File:Mill Pond Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]].]]
{{Main|Pond}}
A '''pond''' is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [[current (stream)|current]] speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

===Rivers===
[[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nile]] river in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]'s capital city]]
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS – U.S. Geological Survey – FAQs], No. 17 What is the difference between mountain, hill, and [[Summit (topography)|peak]]; lake and pond; or river and [[stream|creek]]?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater]] recharge, [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from [[glacier]]s).

===Streams===
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|A rocky stream in [[Hawaii]]]]
{{Main|Stream}}
A stream is a flowing body of water with a [[Current (stream)|current]], confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide. Streams are important as conduits in the [[water cycle]], instruments in [[groundwater recharge]], and they serve as corridors for fish and [[wildlife]] migration. The biological [[habitat]] in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [[riparian zone]]. Given the status of the ongoing [[Holocene extinction]], streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology|fluvial geomorphology]], [[aquatic ecology]], [[Freshwater fish|fish biology]], [[riparian|riparian ecology]], and others.

{{Main|Ecology|Ecosystem}}
Ecosystems are composed of a variety of [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] components that function in an interrelated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Introduction to the Ecosystem Concept |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9j.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: [[soil]], atmosphere, radiation from the [[sun]], water, and living organisms.
[[File:PenasBlancas, part of the Bosawas Reserve, Jinotega Department, Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|left|Peñas Blancas, part of the [[Bosawás Biosphere Reserve]]. Located northeast of the city of [[Jinotega]] in Northeastern Nicaragua.]]
Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s interact with every other element in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;Odum, EP (1971) ''Fundamentals of ecology'', 3rd edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [[food chain]], and exchange energy and [[matter]] between themselves as well as with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Organization of Life |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9d.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature [[dichotomy]] and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&amp;pg=PA237|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|date=2011-09-20|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439820094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller unit of size is called a [[microecosystem]]. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole [[ecoregion]], with its [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey |first=Robert G. |date=April 2004 |title=Identifying Ecoregion Boundaries |journal=Environmental Management |volume=34 |pmid=15883869 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1007/s00267-003-0163-6 |pages=S14–26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lleZy8MU?url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilderness===
[[File:Biogradska suma.jpg|thumb|[[Old-growth forest|Old growth]] [[European Beech]] forest in [[Biogradska Gora]] National Park, [[Montenegro]].]]
{{Main|Wilderness}}
'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, [[:Category:national forests|national forests]], [[national park]]s, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], and solitude. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,&lt;ref name="Man p155-157"&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (2000) ''No Man's Garden'', Island Press, pp. 155–57, {{ISBN|1559634650}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural [[ecosystem]] (the [[biosphere]]). They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and that they provide [[habitat]] for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s, or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

==Life==
{{Life timeline}}
[[File:Malards in Golden Gate Park.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Female mallard and ducklings – [[reproduction]] is essential for continuing life]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}
Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [[Artificial life|analogs of life]] may also be considered to be life.

The [[biosphere]] is the part of Earth's outer shell&amp;nbsp;– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere&amp;nbsp;– within which life occurs, and which [[Biology|biotic]] processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [[Geophysiology|geophysiological]] point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]] (rocks), [[hydrosphere]] (water), and [[atmosphere]] (air). The entire Earth contains over 75&amp;nbsp;billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The figure "about one-half of one percent" takes into account the following (See, e.g., {{cite book |last=Leckie |first=Stephen |date=1999 |chapter=How Meat-centred Eating Patterns Affect Food Security and the Environment |chapterurl=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=For hunger-proof cities: sustainable urban food systems |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |isbn=978-0889368828 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113020336/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html }}, which takes global average weight as 60&amp;nbsp;kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;billion (see, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |title=World Population Information |url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}): Assuming 60–70&amp;nbsp;kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130–150&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390&amp;nbsp;billion (390×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) and 455&amp;nbsp;billion kg (between 845&amp;nbsp;billion and 975&amp;nbsp;billion lb, or about 423&amp;nbsp;million–488&amp;nbsp;million [[short ton]]s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg (75&amp;nbsp;billion short tons).

Once life had appeared, the process of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the [[fossil]] record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and [[DNA]] evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.&lt;ref name=Line/&gt;

With the ozone layer absorbing harmful [[ultraviolet radiation]], life colonized the surface of Earth.

These life forms are found in almost every location on the Earth where there is liquid water, including in the Earth's interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Szewzyk U|author2 = Szewzyk R|author3 = Stenström T|title = Thermophilic, anaerobic bacteria isolated from a deep borehole in granite in Sweden|doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.5.1810|journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume = 91|issue = 5|pages = 1810–13|date = 1994|pmid = 11607462|pmc = 43253|bibcode = 1994PNAS...91.1810S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some microorganisms are [[pathogenic]] and can post health risk to other organisms.

===Plants and animals===
{{Main|Plant|Animal}}
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|A selection of diverse [[plant species]]]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|A selection of diverse [[animal species]]]]
Originally [[Aristotle]] divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' system, these became the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Vegetabilia]] (later [[Plantae]]) and [[Animal]]ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=flora |url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1998 |title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |publisher=Department of the Interior, Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |id=SuDocs No. I 19.202:ST 1/V.1-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715060359/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional [[flora]]s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include ''fossil flora'', remnants&lt;br&gt; of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from bacteria, [[archaea]], and most [[protist]]s. They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.

With a few exceptions—most notably the two [[Phylum|phyla]] consisting of [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]ns—animals have bodies that are differentiated into [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shells]], [[bone]]s, and [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]], a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

==Human interrelationship==
{{Human timeline}}
[[File:Na Pali Coast - Kauai.jpg|thumb|left|Despite their natural beauty, the secluded valleys along the [[Na Pali Coast]] in Hawaii are heavily modified by introduced [[invasive species]] such as [[She-oak]].]]
Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feedback Loops in Global Climate Change Point to a Very Hot 21st Century|publisher=Science Daily|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [[extinction]] of many plants and animals.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|title=Natural Resources contribution to GDP|date=November 2014|website=World Development Indicators (WDI)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223080408/https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|archive-date=December 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2012.html|title=GDP – Composition by Sector|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|work=[[The World Factbook]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [[Agriculture#History|Agriculture]] was first adopted around the [[9th millennium BCE]]. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/plants/medicinal/plants.htm|title = Plant Conservation Alliance – Medicinal Plant Working Groups Green Medicine|publisher = US National Park Services |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Oosthoek|first = Jan|date = 1999|url = http://www.eh-resources.org/philosophy.html|title = Environmental History: Between Science &amp; Philosophy|publisher = Environmental History Resources|accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and beauty===
[[File:504px-Pinguiculagrandiflora1web.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', commonly known as a [[Butterwort]]]]
Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]]. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909220214/http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in China during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]], [[wilderness]] portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic movement also coincided with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]] in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [[Substantial form|forms]] and more generally by [[patterns in nature]]. As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David |isbn=978-1608192168| date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}}

==Matter and energy==
[[File:Hydrogen Density Plots.png|thumb|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]] shown as cross-sections with color-coded probability density]]
{{Main|Matter|Energy}}
Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be "[[physics]]"&amp;nbsp;– the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature.

Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [[observable universe]]. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent [[cold dark matter]] and 68.3 percent [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="planck_overview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planck 2013 results. I.

The behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined [[physical law]]s. These laws have been employed to produce [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [[physical constant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Taylor|first = Barry N.|date = 1971|url = http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/introduction.html|title = Introduction to the constants for nonexperts|publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate = January 7, 2007

==Beyond Earth==
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] ''(Sizes to scale, distances and illumination not to scale)'']]
[[File:NGC 4414 (NASA-med).jpg|thumb|'''[[NGC 4414]]''' is a spiral galaxy in the constellation [[Coma Berenices]] about 56,000 [[light-year]]s in diameter and approximately 60 million light-years from [[Earth]]]]
{{Main|Outer space|Universe|Extraterrestrial life}}
Outer space, also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the [[universe]] outside the [[atmosphere]]s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from [[airspace]] (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [[Solar System]] is called [[interplanetary space]], which passes over into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]] at what is known as the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]].

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]], [[cosmic microwave background radiation|blackbody radiation]] left over from the [[big bang]] and the origin of the universe, and [[cosmic ray]]s, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various [[subatomic particle]]s. There is also some gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[dust]], and small [[meteor]]s. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although the Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [[Mars]] possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bibring, J |display-authors=etal|title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars Express data|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5772|pages = 400–04|date = 2006|pmid = 16627738|doi = 10.1126/science.1122659|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Tariq|last = Malik|date = March 8, 2005|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7129347/|title = Hunt for Mars life should go underground|publisher = Space.com via msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the fourth-largest moon of [[Jupiter]], may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Turner, Scott |date = March 2, 1998|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html|title = Detailed Images From Europa Point To Slush Below Surface|publisher = NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar [[Earth analog]]s – planets that lie in the [[habitable zone]] of space surrounding a [[star]], and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Chile:

'''[[Chile]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; country in South America occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes mountains to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern and central Chile was under Inca rule while independent Mapuche inhabited south-central Chile. Chile declared its independence from Spain on 12 February 1818. Today Chile is one of South America's most stable and prosperous nations, a recognized middle power, and an emerging economy.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the Byzantine Empire:

[[Byzantine Empire]] (or '''Byzantium''') &amp;ndash; the [[Constantinople]]-centred [[Roman Empire]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. It is also referred to as the '''Eastern Roman Empire''', primarily in the context of [[Late Antiquity]], while the Roman Empire was still administered with separate eastern and [[Western Roman Empire|western]] political centres.  In its own time, there was no such thing as "the Byzantine Empire," there was just the ongoing Roman Empire; "Byzantine Empire" is a scholarly term of convenience to differentiate the empire from its earlier existence during [[classical antiquity]] before the western half collapsed ''(see [[decline of the Roman Empire]])''.  Its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the '''Roman Empire''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Βασιλεία Ῥωμαίων}}, ''Basileia Rhōmaiōn'';&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|Epstein|1985|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-la|Imperium Romanum}}) or '''Romania''' ({{lang|grc|Ῥωμανία}}).{{sfnm|1a1=Millar|1y=2006|1pp=2, 15|2a1=James|2y=2010|2p=5|3a1=Freeman|3y=1999|3pp=431, 435–437, 459–462|4a1=Baynes|4a2=Moss|4y=1948|4p=xx|5a1=Ostrogorsky|5y=1969|5p=27|6a1=Kaldellis|6y=2007|6pp=2–3|7a1=Kazhdan|7a2=Constable|7y=1982|7p=12|8a1=Norwich|8y=1998|8p=383}} After the Western Roman Empire [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fragmented and collapsed]] in  the 5th century, the eastern half continued to thrive, existing for an additional thousand years until it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. During much of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe.

'''Public open space''' is often referred to by [[urban planner]]s and [[landscape architect]]s by the acronym 'POS'. Varied interpretations of the term are possible.

'Public' can mean:
* owned by a national or local government body
* owned by 'public' body (e.g. a not-for-profit organization) and held in trust for the public
* owned by a private individual or organization but made available for public use or available public access, see [[privately owned public space]] (POPS)

'Open' can mean:
* open for public access
* open for public recreation
* outdoors, i.e. not a space within a building
* vegetated

Depending on which of these definitions are adopted, any of the following could be called Public Open Space:

* a [[public park]]
* a [[town square]]
* a [[greenway (landscape)|greenway]] which is open to the public but runs through farmland or a forest
* a public [[highway]]
* a [[private road]] with public access

'''Pullen Island Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] includes all of [[Pullen Island (South Australia)|Pullen Island]] about {{convert|0.5|km|abbr=off}} south  of [[Port Elliot, South Australia|Port Elliot]] in [[South Australia]] and about {{convert|94|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Adelaide]].  The park was proclaimed in 1972 under ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' replacing earlier protected area status as a Fauna Conservation Reserve which was proclaimed in 1967.  The protected area status exists to protect the island as a breeding area for sea birds such as [[little penguin]]s and [[silver gull]]s.  The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category Ia — Strict Nature Reserve|Category IA protected area]].&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum&gt;{{cite web|title=CAPAD 2012 South Australia Summary (see 'DETAIL' tab)|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/0f927a4e-336a-490c-a896-ec37874a5c73/files/capad2012sa.xlsx|work=CAPAD 2012|publisher=Australian Government - Department of the Environment|accessdate=6 February 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mp&gt;{{cite book |title=Island conservation parks of Backstairs Passage and Encounter Bay management plans|author= |year=1983 |series= |publisher=National Parks and Wildlife Service |location=Adelaide |isbn=0-7243-4588-4|pages=iii, 23–29|url= http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/3a256f5d-26ce-4c7a-a634-9e4f00b1a650/PARKS_PDFS_ISLD_CP_BACKST_P_MP.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1873">In [[navigation|nautical navigation]] the '''relative bearing''' of an object is the clockwise angle from the heading of the vessel to a straight line drawn from the observation station on the vessel to the object.

The relative bearing is measured with a [[pelorus (instrument)|pelorus]] or other optical and electronic aids to navigation such as a [[periscope]], [[sonar system]], and [[radar system]]s. Since World War II, relative bearings of such diverse point sources have been and are calibrated carefully to one another. The [[United States Navy]] operates a special range off [[Puerto Rico]] and another on the west coast to perform such systems integration. Relative bearings then serve as the baseline data for converting relative directional data into [[true bearing]]s (N-S-E-W, relative to the Earth's true geography). By contrast, [[Compass bearing]]s have a varying error factor at differing locations about the globe, and are less reliable than the compensated or true bearings.

The measurement of relative bearings of fixed landmarks and other [[navigational aid]]s is useful for the navigator because this information can be used on the [[nautical chart]] together with simple geometrical techniques to aid in determining the position of the vessel and/or its speed, course, etc.

The measurement of relative bearings of other vessels and objects in movement is useful to the navigator in avoiding the danger of collision.

* Example: The navigator on a ship observes a lighthouse when its relative bearing is 45° and again when it is 90°. He now knows that the distance from the ship to the lighthouse is equal to the distance travelled by the vessel between both observations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2540">[[Image:2012-07-21 The Pinnacles by Old Harry Rocks.JPG|thumb|right|The Pinnacles]]
The '''Pinnacles''' are two [[chalk]] formations, including a [[Stack (geology)|stack]] and a stump, located near Handfast Point, on the [[Isle of Purbeck]] in [[Dorset]], southern [[England]].

== Location ==
The Pinnacles lie directly east of [[Studland]], approximately 200 metres south of [[Old Harry Rocks]] and about 4 kilometres northeast of [[Swanage]]. The chalk [[headland]]s of the [[Ballard Down]]s are owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. The rocks can be viewed from the Dorset section of the [[South West Coast Path#Dorset|South West Coastal Path]].

== Geography ==
The downlands of Ballard Down are formed of chalk with some bands of [[flint]], and were formed approximately 66 million years ago. The bands of stone have been gradually eroded over the centuries, some of the earlier stacks having fallen while new ones have been formed by the breaching of narrow isthmuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/Harry-Rocks.htm |title=Geology of Harry Rock sand Ballard Point |accessdate=2007-12-21 |work=Geology of the Wessex Coast of Southern England }}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the water to the east the Needles on the Isle of Wight are usually visible.  These are also part of the same chalk band and only a few thousand years ago were connected to Ballard Down.

To form the stacks, the sea gradually eroded along the joints and bedding planes where the softer chalk meets harder bedrock of the rock formations to create a cave. This eventually [[erosion|eroded]] right through to create an arch. The arch subsequently collapsed to leave the stacks called The Pinnacles.

'''Veer Lorik Stone,''' also known in Hindi as ''Veer Lorik Patthar'' (English ''veer'';brave, ''patthar'';stone), is situated around 5&amp;nbsp;km from [[Robertsganj]] on Markundi Hill, in the northern Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It is a symbol of love and bravery of Lorik and Manjari, the main characters of the local folklore ‘Loriki’. According to the folk tale, Veer Lorik cut this stone, using his sword, in a single stroke, as proof of his true love. Several folk songs, sung by native folksingers, are based on Loriki. [[Govardhan Puja]], a Hindu festival, is celebrated here every year.&lt;ref name="jagaran#"&gt;{{cite news|title=Khaulte dudh se kiya snan|url=http://www.jagran.com/uttar-pradesh/sonbhadra-11724648.html|accessdate=2 March 2016|agency=Jagaran|issue=daily|publisher= www.Jagaran.com|date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story ==
During the 5th century, there was a state called [[Agori Fort|Agori]] along the Son River (now located in [[Sonbhadra district]]). Molagat, the ruling king of the state, despite being a very good king, was jealous of a [[Yadav]] man named Mehra because of the power he wielded. One day King Molagat invited Mehra to a gambling match. It was proposed that the winner of the gambling game will rule over the state. Mehra accepted the king's proposal and they began gambling. The king lost everything and had to leave his kingdom. Seeing the plight of the king, [[Lord Brahma]] came as a disguised monk and gave him some coins, assuring him that once he plays a game with those coins, his rule would return.The king obeyed, and won. Mehra lost six times and gambled everything away, including his wife, who was pregnant. In the seventh time, he lost his wife's womb as well. But the king seemed to show generosity towards Mehra. He said that if the upcoming baby is a boy then he will work in the stables and if it is girl, she will be appointed in the service of the Queen.

Mehra's seventh child was born as a girl, and named Manjari. When the King discovered this, he sent soldiers to bring Manjari to him. But Manjari's mother refused to part with her  daughter. Instead, she sent a message to the king that he would have to kill Manjari's husband if he wanted to take her with him.

Hence, Manjari's parents were anxious to find a suitor for Manjari who could defeat the king after the wedding. Manjari asked her parents to go to the place of the people named Balia where they will find a youngster named [[Veer Lorik]]. He was her lover in a previous life, and also capable of defeating the king.

Manjari and Lorik's fathers met and the marriage gets fixed. Lorik comes over with half a million people for the wedding, to marry Manjari. 
When they reached the bank of the river son, the king sent his troops to fight Lorik and capture Manjari.
Lorik seemed to be defeated in the war. Manjari, being an extraordinary girl, goes to Veer Lorik and tells him that there is a village named [[Gothani]] near the [[Agori Fort]] . She tells him that there is a temple of Lord Shiva in that village and if he goes there and prays to the god, victory will be his.

Lorik does what Manjari said and wins the war so the both married each other. Before leaving the threshold of the village, Manjari tells Lorik to do something great so that the people remember that they loved each other to such an extent.
[[Veer Lorik]] asked Manjari that what must he do so that it becomes a symbol of true love and no loving couple would ever return disappointed from here.
Manjari, pointing at a stone, asked Lorik to cut the stone with the same sword he used to kill the King. Lorik did the same but there was a new problem; the stone got cut in two pieces but a part of it fell down from the mountain, leaving only one piece of the stone there

Manjari asked Lorik to find the fallen stone and place it with the firm one, so that both the pieces share the same space. Lorik did the same and made the Sign of true love, ''Veer Lorik Stone'', to stand there forever.&lt;ref name="patrika"&gt;{{cite news|title=great love story of manjari and lorik |url=http://www.patrika.com/news/varanasi/great-love-story-of-manjari-and-lorik-12235/|accessdate=13 July 2016|work=www.patrika.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
During [[Govardhan Puja]], many couples come here to pray for everlasting love, like that of [[Veer Lorik]] and Manjari. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.patrika.com/news/sonbhadra/foundation-day-of-sonbhadra-1523331 |title=सोनभद्र का स्थापना दिवस-28 साल से छला जा रहा इस जिले का निवासी Patrika Hindi |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Volcán Barú''' (also '''Volcán de Chiriquí'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=1406-01-|name=Barú}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an active stratovolcano and the tallest [[mountain]] in [[Panama]], at {{convert|3475|m|ft|0}} high. It lies about 35&amp;nbsp;km off the border of [[Costa Rica]].

Due to its height and the narrowness of the isthmus of Panama, it is possible (though relatively rare) to see both the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] from Volcán Barú's peak on a clear day.

==Geography==
The small town of Volcán at the base of Volcán Barú sits on the remnants of a huge [[lahar]] that appears to have breached the caldera.  A small river has eroded the lahar exposing an ancient forest below dated to about 1000 years old (Stewart, pers. communication).

Volcán Barú is surrounded by a fertile area of cool [[Highland (geographic feature)|highlands]] drained by the Chiriquí Viejo and Caldera Rivers. The towns of [[Volcán, Panama|Volcán]] and [[Cerro Punta, Chiriquí|Cerro Punta]] can be found on its western side, while [[Boquete]] is on the eastern flank.

The occasional fall of hail or ice pellets has been reported on the summit, where the minimum temperature can be below 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) and the formation of frost is frequent during the dry season. The peak is host to a large installation of broadcast towers.

==Description==
De Boer et al.&lt;ref&gt;de Boer, J., Defant, M.J., Stewart R. H., Restrepo, J. F., Clark, L. F., and Ramierez A. H., 1988, Quaternary calc-alkaline volcanism in western Panama: Regional variation and implication  for the plate tectonic framework: J. South American Earth Sciences, v. 1, p. 275-293.&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to show that El Barú volcano is active and part of the extension of the [[Central America Volcanic Arc|Central American Volcanic Arc]] in Panama.  Further detailed work on the geochemistry of the lavas from El Barú and other volcanoes in Panama was completed by Defant et al.&lt;ref&gt;Defant, M. J., Jackson, T. E., Drummond, M. S., de Boer, J. Z., Bellon, H., Feigenson, M. D., Maury, R. C., and Stewart, R.H., 1992, The geochemistry of young volcanism throughout western Panama and southeastern Costa Rica: An overview: J. Geol. Soc. Lond., v. 149, p. 569-579.&lt;/ref&gt; They substantiated, based on geochemistry, that the lavas were derived by subduction (calc-alkaline).  Radiometric dates also showed that the volcanism falls into two groups that range from 20 million years to recent. They also showed that the youngest volcanism consists primarily of adakites (partial melts from the subducted slab) whereas the older volcanism is normal calc-alkaline lavas.

===USGS Volcano-Hazards Assessment Study===
In 2006, an [[earthquake swarm]] was registered in the Volcán Barú area. This was not the first one; researchers cite at least three other seismic events of the same nature recorded in the recent past (1930, 1965, 1985).&lt;ref name=Sherrod&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sherrod|first1=D.R.|last2=Vallance|first2=J.W.|last3=Tapia Espinosa|first3=A.|last4=McGeehin|first4=J.P.|year=2008|title=Volcan Barú; eruptive history and volcano-hazards assessment: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2007-1401, 33|pages=1 plate 1|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1401/of2007-1401en_text.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the U.S. Geological Survey ([[United States Geological Survey|USGS]]), in cooperation with Panama's Science, Technology and Innovation Secretariat ([http://www.senacyt.gob.pa/ SENACYT]) and the U.S. Agency for International Development ([[USAID]]), published a study on different aspects of Volcán Barú.&lt;ref name=Sherrod/&gt; The 33-page report outlined potential hazard areas, rock composition, and areas affected by previous eruptions; there is evidence that during the last eruption, which occurred in the 16th century, the debris avalanche deposits covered a volume of 20–30&amp;nbsp;km³, reaching as far as the Pacific Ocean (the largest documented in Central America and nearly 10 times the area covered by the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|Mt. St. Helens debris avalanche in 1980]]).&lt;ref name=Sherrod/&gt;

Data collected at several locations from four previous eruptions which occurred during the last 1600 years indicate that a new eruption would last several years, putting at risk population and costly infrastructure in the areas surrounding the volcano. Typical events during such volcanic episodes include [[pyroclastic flows]], super-heated gas clouds rapidly descending the volcano’s east flank, conceivably reaching as far as Boquete, Alto Boquete, and the Caldera River, and fallout of ash and other particles ranging in size from dust to 1-meter blocks, known as [[tephra]], causing fires, roof collapses, water contamination, crop damage and eye and lung irritation, especially among elders and infants. A third type of event, mud and debris flows, known as [[lahars]], create landslides, obstruct rivers courses, and could have long-term effects in the zone.  The severity of these events is directly related to the lava flows and their interaction with underground water deposits.&lt;ref name=Sherrod/&gt;

A comprehensive set of maps is included with the study, clearly showing the most likely affected areas in [[Boquete]], [[Volcán, Panama|Volcán]], Bambito and other towns in vicinity of the Volcán Barú.&lt;ref name=Sherrod/&gt; The study recommends local authorities should make the population aware of the potential risks, and create a response system in preparation for the eventual onset of an eruptive episode.&lt;ref name=Sherrod/&gt;

==National park==
The volcano was declared '''Volcán Barú National Park''' in 1976, with an area of {{Convert|14325|ha|abbr=on}}. It is a part of the [[Mesoamerican Biological Corridor]]. Fauna include the [[black guan]], [[black-and-white hawk-eagle]], [[Underwood's water mouse]], [[volcano junco]], [[wrenthrush]], and [[yellow-thighed finch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.osatravel.com/volcan-Barú-panama.html |title= Volcan Baru/ Panamá |publisher= Osatravel |accessdate= 8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 250 species of birds have been identified within the park, and all five species of big cats live here as well. The national park protects a range of habitat, including humid montane forests, low humid montane forests, and montane rainforests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baru Volcano National Park|url=http://www.anywherepanama.com/attractions/national-park/baru-volcano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park's most popular hiking trail is the Sendero Los Quetzales (Los Quetzales Trail), which connects Boquete with Cerro Punta and wraps around the side of the volcano. The trail takes around 6 hours to hike. There is another trail to the top of the volcano, but this is long, steep and strenuous. You can, however, see both the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea from the summit on a clear day.

[[File:Garden pond 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A water garden in a private residence]]
'''Water gardens''', also known as '''aquatic gardens''', are a type of [[water feature]]. They can be defined as any interior or exterior [[landscape]] or [[architectural]] element whose primary purpose is to house, display, or propagate a particular species or variety of [[aquatic plant]]. The primary focus is on plants, but they will sometimes also house ornamental [[fish]], in which case the feature will be a fish [[pond]].

Water gardening is gardening that is concerned with growing plants adapted to pools and ponds. Although water gardens can be almost any size or depth, they are typically small and relatively shallow, generally less than twenty inches (50&amp;nbsp;cm) in depth. This is because most aquatic plants are depth sensitive and require a specific water depth in order to thrive. The particular species inhabiting each water garden will ultimately determine the actual [[surface area]] and depth required.

==Description==
[[File:Red Oranda goldfish in outdoor pond.jpg|thumb|Red [[Oranda]] (Wen) goldfish reared in a small outdoor pond with lilies.]]
When the aquatic flora and fauna are balanced, an [[aquatic ecosystem]] is created that will support [[sustainability|sustainable]] water quality and clarity. Elements such as [[fountain]]s, [[statues]], [[waterfall]]s, [[boulder]]s, underwater [[lighting]], lining treatments, edging details, watercourses, and in-water and bankside planting can add visual interest and help to integrate the water garden with the local landscape and environment.

==History==
Water gardens, and water features in general, have been a part of public and private gardens since ancient [[Persian garden]]s and [[Chinese garden]]s. For instance, the (c. 304) ''[[Nanfang Caomu Zhuang]]'' records cultivating [[Chinese spinach]] on floating gardens. Water features have been present and well represented in every era and in every culture that has included [[garden]]s in their landscape and architectural environments. Up until the rise of the [[industrial age]], when the modern [[water pump]] was introduced, water was not recirculated but was diverted from [[river]]s and [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s into the water garden, from which it exited into agricultural fields or natural watercourses. Historically, water features were used to enable plant and fish production both for food purposes and for ornamental aesthetics.

Though the term "water garden" is normally used to describe a particular type of natural or man-made water feature that is used for a relatively specific purpose, there are many other types, styles and designs of water feature.

==Water follies==
[[File:Akvofalo en la ĉina te-paviliono Mannheim.jpg|thumb|left|A water folly.  Tea-pavilion in Mannheim's Chinese garden Duojingyuan]]
The sixteenth century in Europe saw a renewed interest in Greek thought and philosophy, including the works of [[Hero of Alexandria]] about [[hydraulics]] and [[pneumatics]].  His devices, such as temple doors operated by invisible weights or flowing liquids, and mechanical singing birds powered by steam, motivated several European palaces to create similar clever devices to enhance their public image.

In [[Italy]] several royal houses constructed large water gardens incorporating mechanical devices in water settings. The best-known is the [[Villa d'Este#Description of the garden|Villa d'Este]] at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]], constructed in 1550 AD. A hill cascaded with many fountains and [[grotto]]es, some with water-driven figures that moved or spouted water.  Popularity spread across Europe with the well-known water garden at [[Hellbrunn Palace]] built with many water-powered human and animal performing figures and [[puppet theater]]s, and [[folly]] fountains that erupted without notice to surprise visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32431088|title=Connections|last=Burke|first=James|date=1995|publisher=Little, Brown and Co.|year=|isbn=0316116726|edition=Rev.|location=Boston|pages=106|asin=0316116726|oclc=32431088}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

== Stream gardens ==
On a constructed stream, placing rocks in the path of the water makes small patterns, [[rapids]] and [[waterfall]]s. The rocks disrupt the waterflow, causing splashing and bubbles that can make pleasant sounds and micro-habitats for plants, fish, and wildlife. Well-placed rocks can create splashing water that adds oxygen to prevent [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]]: the more bubbles, the more [[Oxygen saturation#Environmental sciences|dissolved oxygen]] in the water.

Water garden plants are divided into three main categories: submerged, marginal, and floating.
* Submerged plants are those that live almost completely under the water, sometimes with leaves or flowers that grow to the surface such as with the water lily. These plants are placed in a pond or container usually {{convert|1|-|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} below the water surface. Some of these plants are called oxygenators because they create oxygen for the fish that live in a pond. Examples of submerged plants are:
** [[Nymphaeaceae|Water lily]] (Hardy and Tropical)
** Hornwort (''[[Ceratophyllum demersum]]'')
* Marginal plants are those that live with their roots under the water but the rest of the plant above the surface.  These are usually placed so that the top of the pot is at or barely below the water level.  Examples of these are:
** Iris or Flag (''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' spp.)
** Water-crowfoot (''[[Ranunculus fluitans]]'')
** Bulrush (''[[Scirpus lacustris]]'')
** Cattail (''[[Typha latifolia]]'')
** Taro (''[[Colocasia esculenta]]'')
** Arrowhead (''[[Sagittaria latifolia]]'')
** Lotus (''[[Nelumbo]]'' spp.)
** Pickerelweed (''[[Pontederia cordata]]'')
* Floating plants are those that are not anchored to the soil at all, but are free-floating on the surface.  In water gardening, these are often used as a provider of shade to reduce algae growth in a pond.  These are often extremely fast growing/multiplying.  Examples of these are:
** Mosquito ferns (''[[Azolla]]'' spp.)
** Water-spangle (''[[Salvinia]]'' spp.)
** Water-clover (''[[Marsilea]] vestita'')
** Water Lettuce (''[[Pistia|Pistia stratiotes]]'')
** Water Hyacinth (''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'')

Some areas of the United States do not allow certain of these plants to be sold or kept, as they have become [[invasive species]] in warmer areas of the country, such as [[Florida]] and [[California]].

===Algae===

[[Algae]] are found in almost all ponds. There are hundreds of species of algae that can grow in garden ponds, but they are usually noticed only when they become abundant. Algae often grow in very high densities in ponds because of the high nutrient levels that are typical of garden ponds. Generally, algae attaches itself to the sides of the pond and remains innocuous. Some species of algae, such as "blanket weed", can grow up to a foot a day under ideal conditions and can rapidly clog a garden pond. On the other hand, free floating algae are microscopic and are what cause pond water to appear green. Blanket weed, although unsightly, is actually a sign that the water is clean and well-balanced. Green water (free floating algae) means there are too many nutrients in the water, usually from rotting vegetation or too many fish for the space. Killing the free floating algae with chemicals will often cause it to die, rot, and then make the problem even worse as more nutrients enter the water. Adding more floating or submerged (unpotted) plants can help with the green water, as they can take the nutrients out of the water. There are also filters that can be installed to remove the nutrients and all types of algae from the water. Many ponds naturally go green early in the spring and then clear up.

== Fauna ==

=== Fish ===

[[File:Yuyuan Garden.jpg|thumb|upright|Fish in a pond in Yuyuan Garden, Shanghai]]

Often the reason for having a pond in a garden is to keep [[fish]], often [[koi]], though many people keep [[goldfish]].  Both are hardy, colorful fish which require no special heating, provided the pond is located in an area which does not have extremes of temperature that would affect the fish. If fish are kept, pumps and filtration devices are usually needed in order to keep enough oxygen in the water to support them. In winter, a small heater may need to be used in cold climates to keep the water from freezing solid. Examples of common pond fish include:

*[[Ricefish]] ([[Himedaka]])
*[[Mosquitofish]]
*[[Fathead minnow|Rosy Red minnows]]
*[[White Cloud Mountain minnow]]s
*[[Goldfish]] (Common, Comet, Shubunkin varieties, Wakin and the Fantail varieties. With the possible exception of some of the fantail varieties, the fancy goldfish are not suited to pond life.)
*[[Crucian carp]]
*[[Koi]] (Nishikigoi, Butterfly Koi and Ghost Koi)
*[[Mirror carp]]
*[[Carp]] (In Australia, carp are considered an invasive fish and it is illegal to release them into waterways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daff.qld.gov.au/fisheries/pest-fish/noxious-fish/carp|title=Carp|last=|first=|date=|website=Department of Agriculture and Fisheries of Queensland|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

=== Snails ===

*[[River snail]]
Small aquatic [[snail]]s are usually found in ponds that contain plants. Some people purchase [[apple snail]]s to keep in their water garden. "Melantho snails" of the genus ''[[Lymnaea]]'' are also used.

=== Herpetofauna ===

Ponds located in suburban and rural areas often attract [[amphibian]]s such as [[Common Frog]]s and [[Fire Salamander]]s and [[reptile]]s such as [[turtle]]s, [[lizard]]s, and [[snake]]s.

=== Bird ===

*[[Wild duck]]
*[[Domestic duck]]

=== Predators ===

Garden ponds can attract attention from predators such as (in North America) [[raccoon]]s, [[heron]]s, snakes, and domestic [[cat]]s. These predators can be a danger to fish. Owners of koi are often particularly careful to create protected areas as some varieties are very expensive.

'''Övre Rudasjön''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for "Upper [[Crucian carp]] Lake"), or '''Övre Rudan''' for short, is a [[lake]] in [[Haninge Municipality]], 18&amp;nbsp;km (11&amp;nbsp;mi) south of central [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. Forming part of the [[Tyresån Lake System]], its major inflow comes from lakes [[Nedre Rudasjön]] ("Lower Crucian carp Lake") and [[Trylen]] to the south, while its outflow passes over [[Dammträsk]] into [[Drevviken]] to the north.

The tall buildings of [[Handen]] commercial centre along the eastern shore of the lake contrast the dense forest of the [[Rudan Open-air Area]] on the opposite shore. The proximity to the [[Stockholm commuter rail|commuter rail]] station at Handen, makes the lake easily accessible to a large number of people, while the forests surrounding it makes it attractive to open-air lovers. It is used for bathing in summers and [[cross-country skiing]] in winters.&lt;ref&gt;''Övre Rudan'', Tyresåsamarbetet&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to other lakes in the Tyresån Lake System, levels of phosphorus in the lake are moderate.&lt;ref&gt;''Appendix 5'' (PDF), Tyresåsamarbetet&lt;/ref&gt;

With are 28 species of [[vascular plant]]s by the lake and 1 species of [[Charales|Stoneworth]] in it, the lake fauna is considered relatively rich in species.&lt;ref name="SöEko" /&gt;
