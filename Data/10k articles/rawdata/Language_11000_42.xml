The '''Annobonese''' is a [[Portuguese creole]] known to its speakers as '''Fa d'Ambu''' or '''Fá d'Ambô'''  ({{lang-pt|Fala de Ano-Bom}}).  It  is spoken on the [[Annobón]] and [[Bioko]] Islands off the coast of [[Equatorial Guinea]], mostly by people of mixed [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Portuguese Africans|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent. It is called ''annobonense'' or ''annobonés'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The attitude in the country towards this language is positive. It is taught in special courses in the capital of [[Equatorial Guinea]], Malabo.

==Origins==

The creole language was spoken originally by the descendants of [[miscegenation|intermixing]] between Portuguese men and [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] women [[slave]]s imported from other places, especially from São Tomé and Angola, and therefore descends from Portuguese and Forro, the creole of the freed slaves of São Tomé. The government of Equatorial Guinea financed an [[International Portuguese Language Institute|Instituto Internacional da Língua Portuguesa]] (IILP) sociolinguistic study in [[Annobón]], which noticed strong links with the Portuguese creole populations in São Tomé and Príncipe, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau.&lt;ref name="sol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sol.pt/noticia/99354 |title=Formação de professores e programas televisivos introduzem português na Guiné-Equatorial | language=Portuguese |trans-title=Teacher formation and television programs introduce Portuguese in Equatorial Guinea |publisher=Sol |date=5 February 2014 |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

Annobonese is analogous to [[Forro language|Forro]].  In fact, it may be derived from Forro as it shares the same structure and 82% of its lexicon.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} After [[Annobón]] passed to [[Spain]], the language incorporated some words of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] origin (10% of its lexicon),{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, but it is often difficult to say from which language the word derive, given the similarity between Spanish and Portuguese. Today, the [[Spanish language]] is the official language of the island, although it is not much spoken and the Portuguese creole has vigorous use in the island and in the capital Malabo and with some speakers in Equatorial Guinea's mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/fab |title=Fa d’Ambu |publisher=Ethnologue |accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noncreolized Portuguese is used as liturgical language. Portuguese has been declared an official language in Equatorial Guinea, but so far is rarely used in [[Bioko]] and [[Rio Muni|Rio Muñi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equatorial-guinea-adds-portuguese-as-the-countrys-third-official-language-131882808.html |title=Equatorial Guinea Adds Portuguese as the Country's Third Official Language |publisher=PRNewsWire |date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuineEqGov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/noticia.php?id=703l |title=El portugués será el tercer idioma oficial de la República de Guinea Ecuatorial  |publisher=Gobierno de la Republica de Guinea Ecuatoria |accessdate=15 November 2010 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuineEqGovPDF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/imgdb/2010/20-7-2010Decretosobreelportuguescomoidiomaoficial.pdf | format=PDF| title=Proyecto de Ley Constitucional  |publisher=Gobierno de la Republica de Guinea Ecuatorial |date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''Association for Computational Linguistics''' ('''ACL''') is the international scientific and professional society for people working on problems involving [[natural language and computation]]. An annual meeting is held each summer in locations where significant [[computational linguistics]] research is carried out. It was founded in 1962, originally named the '''Association for Machine Translation and Computational Linguistics''' ('''AMTCL'''). It became the ACL in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclweb.org/portal/what-is-cl|title=What is the ACL and what is Computational Linguistics? {{!}} ACL Member Portal|website=www.aclweb.org|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACL has a European ([[European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics|EACL]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eacl.org/page.php?id=about|title=EACL Home|website=www.eacl.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a North American ([[North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics|NAACL]]) chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naacl.org/about/index.html|title=NAACL: North American Chapter of the ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics)|last=Sarkar|first=Anoop|website=naacl.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACL journal, [[Computational Linguistics (journal)|''Computational Linguistics'']], is the primary forum for research on computational linguistics and [[natural language processing]]. Since 1988, the journal has been published for the ACL by [[MIT Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/coli|title=List of Issues {{!}} Computational Linguistics {{!}} MIT Press Journals|website=www.mitpressjournals.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cljournal.org/|title=Computational Linguistics|website=cljournal.org|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special Interest Groups==
ACL has a large number of Special Interest Groups (SIGs), focusing on specific areas of natural language processing. Some current SIGs within ACL are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclweb.org/portal/sigs|title=Special Interest Groups {{!}} ACL Member Portal|website=www.aclweb.org|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bacama''' (Bachama) is an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language spoken in [[Nigeria]] in [[Adamawa State]], principally in the [[Numan, Nigeria|Numan]] and [[Guyuk, Nigeria|Guyuk]] Local Government Areas, and in [[Kaduna State]] northeast of [[Kaduna]] town.  Dialects are Mulyen, Opalo, and Wa-Duku.  Bacama is used as a trade language.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; It is often considered the same language as [[Bata language|Bata]].

==Numerals==
Bacama has a decimal/[[quinary]] [[Numeral (linguistics)|number system]], with both 5 and 10 as bases:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081005230737/http://www3.aa.tufs.ac.jp/~P_aflang/TEXTS/oct98/decimal.html Matsushita, 'Decimal vs. Duodecimal']&lt;/ref&gt;

Other show bibles are used as sales documents to help a [[television network]] or [[television studio|studio]] understand a series, and are sometimes given to new writers when they join the writing staff for the same reason.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt; These types of bibles discuss the backstories of the main characters and the history of the series' fictional universe.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt;

Television series often rely on writers' assistants and [[script coordinator]]s to serve as "walking bibles" in remembering details about a series.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5359">{{About|the psychological term}}
{{Distinguish|Catharsis}}

In [[psychoanalysis]], '''cathexis''' is defined as the process of investment of [[mental energy|mental or emotional energy]] in a person, object, or idea.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Calvin S. ''A Primer of Freudian Psychology''. New York: Mentor, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of term==

The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term ''cathexis'' (κάθεξις) was chosen by [[James Strachey]] to render the [[German language|German]] term ''Besetzung'' in his translation of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s complete works. Freud himself wrote of "interest (Besetzung)", in an early letter to [[Ernest Jones]].&lt;ref name= Gay465n&gt;{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Peter|title=Freud|year=1989|page=465n}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Gay]] objected that Strachey's use of cathexis was an unnecessarily esoteric replacement for Freud's use of ''Besetzung'' – "a word from common German speech rich in suggestive meanings, among them 'occupation' (by troops) and 'charge' (of [[Electric charge|electricity]])".&lt;ref name= Gay465n/&gt;

==Usage==

Freud defined cathexis as an investment of [[libido]], pointing out for example how dream thoughts were cathected with different amounts of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; A cathexis or emotional charge might be positive or negative, leading some of his followers to speak as well of a cathexis of [[mortido]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, '' A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 54 and p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Freud called a group of cathected ideas a [[Complex (psychology)|complex]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (1995) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud frequently described the functioning of psychosexual energies in quasi-physical terms,&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2013}} representing frustration of libidinal desires, for example, as a blockage of (cathected) energies which would eventually build up and require release in alternative ways. This release could occur, for example, by way of [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] and the "re-cathecting" of former positions or [[fixation (psychology)|fixation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', pp. 123–4&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[autoeroticism|autoerotic]] enjoyment (in phantasy) of former sexual objects: "object-cathexes".

Freud used the term "[[anticathexis|anti-cathexis]]" or counter-charge&lt;ref&gt;Felluga, Dino. "Terms Used by Psychoanalysis." Introductory Guide to Critical Theory. Purdue U. 31 August 2009. ([http://www.purdue.edu/guidetotheory/psychoanalysis/psychterms.html online])&lt;/ref&gt; to describe how the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|ego]] blocks such regressive efforts to discharge one's cathexis: that is, when the ego wishes to [[psychological repression|repress]] such [[Interpersonal attraction|desires]]. Like a steam engine, the libido's cathexis then builds up until it finds alternative outlets, which can lead to [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]], [[reaction formation]], or the construction of (sometimes disabling) symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[M. Scott Peck#Love|M. Scott Peck]] distinguishes between love and cathexis, with cathexis being the initial in-love phase of a relationship, and love being the ongoing commitment of care.

==Object relations==

Freud saw the early cathexis of objects with libidinal energy as a central aspect of human development.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'' p. 118 and pp. 151–8&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the withdrawal of cathexes which accompanied the mourning process, Freud provided his major contribution to the  foundation of [[object relations theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (2003) p. x-xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thinking==

Freud saw thinking as an experimental process involving minimal amounts of cathexis, “in the same way as a general shifts small figures about on a map”.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'' p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In delusions, it was the hypercathexis (or over-charging) of ideas previously dismissed as odd or eccentric which he saw as causing the subsequent pathology.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==

[[Eric Berne]] raised the possibility that [[child art]] often represented the intensity of cathexis invested in an object, rather than its objective form.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics charge that the term provides a potentially misleading neurophysiological analogy, which might be applicable to the cathexis of ideas but certainly not of objects.&lt;ref&gt;J. Laplanche/J-B Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' () p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Further ambiguity in Freud's usage emerges in the contrast between cathexis as a measurable load of (undifferentiated) libido, and as a qualitatively distinct type of affect – as in a "cathexis of longing".&lt;ref&gt;Laplanche, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[constructed language]] community, the '''color argument''' is an often repeated [[argument]] that an [[international auxiliary language]] based on the languages of one area is only suitable for the inhabitants of that area. Whether or not it is true is often a subject of heated debate.

The term itself comes from the phrase "as European as the color green", which was used in the defense of [[Esperanto]] during the early nineties on a constructed language mailing list. The intention was to note that Esperanto's vocabulary list, despite being of European origins, describe ideas and necessary concepts found everywhere, regardless of linguistic background. The phrase eventually changed into "as biased as the color green", and stuck. (See [[distinguishing blue from green in language]].)

Nowadays, the term color argument is used to refer to a discussion about constructed languages that centers solely on the sources of the vocabulary and/or grammar, as opposed to any other merits or flaws of the language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7065">{{other uses|Diaeresis (disambiguation)}}
'''Diairesis''' ({{lang-grc|διαίρεσις|diaíresis}}, "division") is a form of [[Categorization|classification]] used in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient]] (especially [[Platonic philosophy|Platonic]]) [[logic]] that serves to systematize concepts and come to definitions. When defining a concept using diairesis, one starts with a broad concept, then divides this into two or more specific sub-concepts, and this procedure is repeated until a definition of the desired concept is reached. Apart from this definition, the procedure also results in a [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of other concepts, ordered according to a general–specific relation.

The founder of diairesis as a method was [[Plato]]. Later ancient logicians (including [[Aristotle]]) and practitioners of other ancient sciences have employed diairetic modes of classification, e.g., to classify plants in ancient biology. Although classification is still an important part of science, diairesis has been abandoned and is now of historical interest only.

== Plato's method of definition ==
{{see also|Sophist (dialogue)#Method of definition}}

Diairesis is Plato's later method of [[definition]] based on division, developed in the Platonic dialogues ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]'', ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'', and ''[[Philebus]]''. Further applications are found in the ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christian |last=Pietsch |title=Die Dihairesis der Bewegung in Platon, Nomoi X 893b1-894c9 |journal=Rheinisches Museum für Philologie |year=2003 |volume=146 |pages=303–327 |jstor=41234713 |url=http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/146/Pietsch.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Timaeus (Plato)|Timaeus]]''. It is a means of attempting to reach a definition by which a collection of candidates is repeatedly divided into two parts with one part eliminated until a suitable definition is discovered.

A complementary term is ''merismos'' (cf. English [[merism]]: parsing or the distinguishing of parts, as opposed to ''diairesis'', which is the division of a genus into its parts).

For example, in the ''Sophist'' (§235B), the Eleatic Stranger is examining illusions, which consist of words and "visual objects." By using ''diairesis'', he divides visual objects, by which it becomes clear he means works of art, into two categories: ''eikastikē [[technē]]'', the art of making likenesses or ''eikones''; and ''phantastikē technē'', the art of creating illusionary appearances. The Stranger is much more fond of the former; the latter are only created to produce an appearance of beauty.

== The method of ''diairesis'' in the history of philosophy ==

=== Forerunners of Plato ===
Opinions about possible forerunners of Platonic ''diairesis'' are varying; they even reach back until [[Homer]]. Also an adoption from the fields of mathematics has been considered,&lt;ref&gt;(german) [[Hans Leisegang]]: ''Denkformen'', Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 1951, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; like one from musicology,&lt;ref&gt;(german) Hermann Koller: ''Die dihäretische Methode'', in: Glotta Vol. 39, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen 1961, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; one from pre-scientific and everyday divisions&lt;ref&gt;(german) [[Hans Herter]]: ''Platons Naturkunde'', in: Rheinisches Museum für Philologie Vol. 121, 1978, p. 111, online: [http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/inhalt1970.htm#1978]&lt;/ref&gt; and one from medicine.&lt;ref&gt;(german) Hans Herter: ''Platons Naturkunde'', in: Rheinisches Museum für Philologie Vol. 121, 1978, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; About forerunners in the field of philosophy there are as well different opinions. Under consideration are [[Prodicus|Prodicus of Ceos]],&lt;ref&gt;(german) Christian Schäfer (editor): ''Platon-Lexikon'', Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft Darmstadt 2007, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lloyd Ackrill]]: ''In Defense of Platonic Division'', in: Essays on Plato and Aristotle, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1997, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; [[Democritus]], [[Leucippus]]&lt;ref&gt;(german) [[Julius Stenzel]]: ''Studien zur Entwicklung der platonischen Dialektik von Sokrates zu Aristoteles'', 2. edition 1931, Nachdruck: Teubner, Stuttgart 1961, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;, and the [[sophism|sophists]].&lt;ref&gt;(german) Artur v. Fragstein: ''Die Diairesis bei Aristoteles'', Adolf M. Hakkert, Amsterdam 1967, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; It was even suggested that Plato says that he himself found the new method,&lt;ref&gt;(german) Margot Fleischer: ''Hermeneutische Anthropologie - Platon, Aristoteles'', Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 1976, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; which shows that it is possible that Plato had no forerunners at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Robinson (philosopher)|Richard Robinson]]: ''Plato's Earlier Dialectic'', Oxford University Press, Oxford 1953, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later exponents of the method of ''diairesis'' ===
The platonic method of division is found to be applicated at the first steps of classifying biology, namely in the zoology of [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;(german) Hans Herter: ''Platons Naturkunde'', in: Rheinisches Museum für Philologie Vol. 121, 1978, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; and in the botany of [[Theophrastus]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans Herter: ''Platons Naturkunde'', in: Rheinisches Museum für Philologie Vol. 121, 1978, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Diairesis is central to [[Galen]]'s therapeutics; see for example 'Therapeutics to Glaucon' 1 (XI, 4 K), where Galen, attributing the method to Plato, asserts that 'the errors of the [medical] sects and whatever mistakes the majority of physicians make in the care of the sick have incompetent division as their principal and major cause' (tr. Dickson.)&lt;ref&gt;Keith Dickson: 'Stephanus the Philosopher and Physician, Commentary on Galen's Therapeutics to Glaucon', Leiden:Brill, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophically relevant methodical divisions or statements about the method of ''diairesis'' can be found at exponents of the Platonic Academy (especially [[Speusippus]]&lt;ref&gt;See John Dillon (1998). "Speusippus." In E. Craig (Ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved October 10, 2007, from http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/A111SECT3&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Xenocrates]]), exponents of the [[Peripatetic school]] (especially [[Aristotle]], [[Aristoxenus]], [[Theophrastus]]), at the [[Stoicism]] (especially [[Chrysippus]]), at the [[Middle Platonism]] (especially [[Alcinous (philosopher)|Alcinous]], [[Maximus of Tyre]], [[Philo]]) and at the [[Neoplatonism]] (especially [[Plotinus]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]). In medieval times the so-called method of ''divisio'' was a common method.&lt;ref&gt;(german) Hans Leisegang: ''Denkformen'', Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 1951, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''[[Hans Diergaardt|J.G.A. Diergaardt]] (late Captain of the Rehoboth Baster Community) et al. v. [[Namibia]]''''' (No. 760/1997) (2000) was a case decided by the [[United Nations]] [[Human Rights Committee]].  

==Complaints==

Representatives of the [[Rehoboth, Namibia|Rehoboth]] [[Baster|Baster Community]] filed an official complaint  over alleged violations of Articles 1 ([[right to self-determination]]), 14 ([[equality before the law|equality before the courts]]), 17 ([[privacy]]), 25 (right to participate in public life), 26 (ban of [[discrimination]]) and 27 ([[minority rights]]) under the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ([[ICCPR]]), in effect since 1976.

==Committee's views==

The committee found that it has no competence over alleged violations of Article 1, and that no violations of Articles 14, 17, 25 and 27 were shown by the facts before it.

The committee held that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the authors have shown that the State party has instructed civil servants not to reply to the authors' written or oral communications with the authorities in the [[Afrikaans language]], even when they are perfectly capable of doing so. These instructions barring the use of Afrikaans do not relate merely to the issuing of public documents but even to telephone conversations. In the absence of any response from the State party the Committee must give due weight to the allegation of the authors that the circular in question is intentionally targeted against the possibility to use Afrikaans when dealing with public authorities. Consequently, the Committee finds that the authors, as Afrikaans speakers, are victims of a violation of article 26 of the Covenant" (Para. 10.10.).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Members Abdalfattah Amor, Nisuke Ando, [[P. N. Bhagwati]], Lord Colville, [[Maxwell Yalden]] and [[Rajsoomer Lallah]] filed four dissenting opinions on Article 26; members [[Elizabeth Evatt]], Eckart Klein, David Kretzmer, [[Cecilia Medina Quiroga]] and [[Martin Scheinin]] filed two concurring opinions on the same issue. Elizabeth Evatt and Cecilia Medina Quiroga filed a concurring opinion on Article 27.

'''''Do You Speak American?''''' is a [[documentary film]] and accompanying [[book]] about [[journalism|journalist]] [[Robert MacNeil]]'s investigation into how different people throughout the [[United States of America]] speak. The book and documentary look at the evolution of America's way of speaking from the [[English language]] to various ways of speaking in regions throughout the country. Divisions of [[ethnicity]], [[geography]] and [[social status]] and how they affect how Americans communicate are addressed. As part of the project, MacNeil traveled across the country conducting interviews with ordinary people as well as experts such as [[William Labov]].

In the United States, the documentary was broadcast in several parts on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. The companion book ({{ISBN|0-385-51198-1}}) was co-authored by MacNeil and William Cran.

A '''Eurocrat''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "European" and "[[bureaucrat]]") is "a staff member of the [[European Commission|administrative commission]] of the [[European Union]]"&lt;ref name="Eurocrat"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eurocrat Eurocrat], [[Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]].

[[Wiley-Blackwell]]. p. 543. {{ISBN|978-0-631-20271-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Richard Mayne (administrator)|Richard Mayne]], a journalist and personal assistant to the first Commission president, [[Walter Hallstein]], in 1961.&lt;ref name="Eurocrat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarvie, Gordon (2007) ''Bloomsbury Grammar Guide: Grammar Made Easy''. [[A &amp; C Black]]. p. 83. {{ISBN|978-0-7136-8187-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayne"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/dec/21/richard-mayne-obituary|title=Richard Mayne obituary|date=22 December 2009|work=The Guardian|page=30|accessdate=22 December 2009 | location=London | first=Gillian | last=Tindall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main types of Eurocrats. First, Political Appointees, such as the European Commissioners, the Members of the European parliament. Secondly there are fonctionnaires, these are the permanent staff which form the majority of the European institutions. There are two categories of fonctionnaires Assistants and Administrators. Assistants perform a "secretarial" roles while administrators perform more policy or managerial responsibilities. The third category is the contractual agents. Contractual agents do not have an employment contract with the same conditions as the fonctionnaires. Their first job contract is limited in duration, however after several renewals this can be extended permanently. Eurocrats come from all member states of the European Union. EPSO is the main body which selects staff for recruitment to the European Institutions.

Nowadays the term Eurocrat has come to encompass staff from all EU Institutions and not only staff from the European Commission.

The related '''no abstract available bias''' is a scholar's tendency to cite journal articles that have an [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] available online more readily than articles that do not— this affects articles' citation count similarly to FUTON bias.&lt;ref name="cite pmid|15301326" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cite pmid|12401287" /&gt;

In [[computing]], '''gettext''' is an [[internationalization and localization]] (i18n) system commonly used for writing multilingual programs on [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]]s. The most commonly used implementation of gettext is '''GNU gettext''',{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} released by the [[GNU Project]] in 1995.

==History==
gettext was originally written by [[Sun Microsystems]] in the early 1990s. The [[GNU Project]] released GNU gettext, a [[free software]] implementation of the system in 1995.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

==Operation==

===Programming===
[[File:Gettext.svg|thumb|Typical gettext workflow.  The de.po instance on the left shows that no string translation was found, so the original string is passed through.]]
Source code is first modified to use the GNU gettext calls. For most [[programming languages]], this is done by wrapping [[string (software)|string]]s that the user will see in the &lt;code&gt;gettext&lt;/code&gt; function. To save typing time, and to reduce code clutter, this function is commonly [[aliasing (computing)|aliased]] to &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;, so that the [[C (programming language)|C]] code:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
printf(gettext("My name is %s.\n"), my_name);
&lt;/source&gt;

would become:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
printf(_("My name is %s.\n"), my_name);
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Comment (computer programming)|Comment]]s (starting with &lt;code&gt;///&lt;/code&gt;) placed directly above strings thus marked are made available as hints to translators by helper programs.

&lt;code&gt;gettext&lt;/code&gt; then uses the supplied strings as keys for looking up alternative translations, and will return the original string when no translation is available. This is in contrast to [[POSIX]] &lt;code&gt;catgets&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/catgets.html |website=gnu.org |title=About catgets |accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[AmigaOS]] &lt;code&gt;GetString&lt;/code&gt;, or the use of &lt;code&gt;LoadString&lt;/code&gt; under [[Microsoft Windows]] where a programmatic ID (often an integer) is used.

&lt;code&gt;xgettext&lt;/code&gt; is run on the sources to produce a &lt;code&gt;.pot&lt;/code&gt; (Portable Object Template) file, which contains a list of all the translatable strings extracted from the sources.

For example, an input file with a comment might look like:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
/// TRANSLATORS: Please leave %s as it is, because it is needed by the program.
/// Thank you for contributing to this project.
printf(_("My name is %s.\n"), my_name);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;xgettext&lt;/code&gt; is run using the command:

 xgettext -c /

The resultant .pot file looks like this with the comment:
&lt;source lang="gettext"&gt;
#. TRANSLATORS: Please leave %s as it is, because it is needed by the program.
#. Thank you for contributing to this project.
#: src/name.c:36
msgid "My name is %s.\n"
msgstr ""
&lt;/source&gt;

===Translating===
The translator derives a &lt;code&gt;.po&lt;/code&gt; (Portable Object) file from the template using the &lt;code&gt;msginit&lt;/code&gt; program, then fills out the translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html |title=GNU gettext utilities: PO Files |website=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;code&gt;msginit&lt;/code&gt; initializes the translations so, for instance, for a French language translation, the command to run would be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icanlocalize.com/site/tutorials/how-to-translate-with-gettext-po-and-pot-files/ |title=How to Translate With GetText PO and POT Files |website=Icanlocalize.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 msginit --locale=fr --input=name.pot

This will create &lt;code&gt;fr.po&lt;/code&gt;. The translator then edits the resultant file, either by hand or with a translation tool like [[Poedit]], or [[Emacs]] with its editing mode for &lt;code&gt;.po&lt;/code&gt; files. An edited entry will look like:
&lt;source lang="gettext"&gt;
#: src/name.c:36
msgid "My name is %s.\n"
msgstr "Je m'appelle %s.\n"
&lt;/source&gt;
Finally, the .po files are compiled with &lt;code&gt;msgfmt&lt;/code&gt; into binary &lt;code&gt;.mo&lt;/code&gt; (Machine Object) files.  GNU gettext has its own file name extension: &lt;code&gt;.gmo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Files.html | title=Files Conveying Translations|website=Gnu.org | accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are now ready for distribution with the software package.

===Running===
The user, on [[Unix]]-type systems, sets the [[environment variable]] &lt;code&gt;LC_MESSAGES&lt;/code&gt;, and the program will display strings in the selected language, if there is an &lt;code&gt;.mo&lt;/code&gt; file for it.

The user, on [[GNU variants]], sets the [[environment variable]] &lt;code&gt;LANGUAGE&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;LC_MESSAGES&lt;/code&gt; is also supported),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Environment-Variables.html#Locale-Environment-Variables |title=GNU gettext utilities: Locale Environment Variables |website=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the program will display strings in the selected language, if there is an &lt;code&gt;.mo&lt;/code&gt; file for it.

'''Gulabdas Broker''' was a [[Gujarati language]] author from India. He is primarily known for his short stories and one-act plays in [[Gujarati literature]].&lt;ref name=sj&gt;{{cite book|last=Jagmohan|first=Sarla|title=Selected Stories from Gujarat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ghkJaKIVTsC&amp;pg=PT9|accessdate=25 April 2017|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7224-955-7|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broker was born at [[Porbandar]] on September 20, 1909. He completed his education in Gujarati and English literature from [[Bombay University]] in 1930. He briefly worked at the [[Bombay Stock Exchange]]. Later he started his writing in 1932 when he was jailed during the [[satyagraha]] movement. His first short story collection was ''Ane Biji Vato'' ("And Other Talks").&lt;ref name=lit&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lTnv6o-d_oC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=gulabdas+broker&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tkxZU-CLO46okgX7-IDADA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBjgK|pages=116–117|title=Handbook of Twentieth-century Literatures of India|first=Nalini Natarajan|last=Emmanuel Sampath Nelson|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1996|isbn=9780313287787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermeneutics''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɜːr|m|ə|ˈ|nj|uː|t|ɪ|k|s}})&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hermeneutics "hermeneutics"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the theory and [[methodology]] of interpretation,&lt;ref name="ahd"&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=hermeneutics American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hermeneutics Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; especially the interpretation of [[Biblical hermeneutics|biblical texts]], [[wisdom literature]], and [[Philosophy|philosophical texts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |last= Audi|first=Robert |edition= 2nd |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521637228 |pages=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion|last=Reese |first=William L. |year=1980 |publisher=Harvester Press |location=Sussex |isbn=0855271477 |page= 221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hermeneutics#Modern hermeneutics|Modern hermeneutics]] includes both verbal and non-verbal communication&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;''The Routledge Companion to Philosophy in Organization Studies'', Routledge, 2015, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JMN"&gt;Joann McNamara, ''From Dance to Text and Back to Dance: A Hermeneutics of Dance Interpretive Discourse'', PhD thesis, Texas Woman's University, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[semiotics]], [[presupposition]]s, and pre-understandings. Hermeneutics has been broadly applied in the humanities, especially in law, history and theology.

Hermeneutics was initially applied to the interpretation, or [[exegesis]], of [[Religious texts|scripture]], and has been later broadened to questions of general interpretation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to  Philosophical Hermeneutics|last=Grondin|first=Jean|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-300-05969-8}} p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''hermeneutics'' and ''exegesis'' are sometimes used interchangeably. Hermeneutics is a wider discipline which includes written, verbal, and non-verbal&lt;ref name="Routledge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JMN" /&gt; communication. Exegesis focuses primarily upon the word and grammar of texts.

Hermeneutic, as a count noun in the singular, refers to some particular method of interpretation (see, in contrast, [[double hermeneutic]]).

==Etymology==
''Hermeneutics'' is derived from the Greek word {{lang|grc|ἑρμηνεύω}} (''hermēneuō'', "translate, interpret"),&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ernest, ''A complete etymological dictionary of the English language: dealing with the origin of words and their sense development, thus illustrating the history of civilization and culture'', Elsevier, Oxford, 2000, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|ἑρμηνεύς}} (''hermeneus'', "translator, interpreter"), of uncertain etymology ([[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] (2009) suggests a [[Pre-Greek]] origin).&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt; The technical term {{lang|grc|ἑρμηνεία}} (''hermeneia'', "interpretation, explanation") was introduced into philosophy mainly through the title of [[Aristotle]]'s work {{lang|grc|Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας}} ("Peri Hermeneias"), commonly referred to by its Latin title ''[[De&amp;nbsp;Interpretatione]]'' and translated in English as  ''On Interpretation''. It is one of the earliest (c.&amp;nbsp;360&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;B.C.&lt;/small&gt;) extant philosophical works in the [[Western philosophy|Western tradition]] to deal with the relationship between language and logic in a comprehensive, explicit and formal way.

The early usage of "hermeneutics" places it within the boundaries of the [[sacred]].&lt;ref&gt;Grondin, Jean (1994). Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-05969-8}}. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Divinity|divine]] message must be received with implicit uncertainty regarding its truth. This ambiguity is an irrationality; it is a sort of madness that is inflicted upon the receiver of the message. Only one who possesses a rational method of interpretation (i.e., a hermeneutic) could determine the truth or falsity of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Grondin, Jean (1994). ''Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics''. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-05969-8}}. pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk etymology===
[[File:Hermes Musei Capitolini MC60.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Hermes]]'', messenger of the gods.]]
[[Folk etymology]] places its origin with [[Hermes]], the mythological Greek [[deity]] who was the 'messenger of the gods'.&lt;ref name="Couzen-Hoy"&gt;Hoy, David Couzen (1981). The Critical Circle. University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0520046399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being a mediator between the gods and between the gods and men, he led souls to the [[Hades|underworld]] upon death.

Hermes was also considered to be the inventor of language and speech, an interpreter, a liar, a thief and a trickster.&lt;ref name="Couzen-Hoy" /&gt; These multiple roles made Hermes an ideal representative figure for hermeneutics. As Socrates noted, words have the power to reveal or conceal and can deliver messages in an ambiguous way.&lt;ref name="Couzen-Hoy" /&gt; The Greek view of language as consisting of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] that could lead to truth or to falsehood was the essence of Hermes, who was said to relish the uneasiness of those who received the messages he delivered.

== In religious traditions ==

===Mesopotamian hermeneutics===
{{See|Exegesis#Mesopotamian Commentaries}}

===Talmudic hermeneutics===
{{Main|Talmudic hermeneutics}}
{{See also|Judaism#Rabbinic hermeneutics|l1=Judaism § Rabbinic hermeneutics}}
{{Eras of the Halakha}}

Summaries of the principles by which Torah can be interpreted date back to, at least, [[Hillel the Elder]], although the thirteen principles set forth in the [[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael]] are perhaps the best known. These principles ranged from standard rules of logic (e.g., [[A fortiori argument|''a fortiori'' argument]] [known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as קל&amp;nbsp;וחומר&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp; ''kal v'chomer'']) to more expansive ones, such as the rule that a passage could be interpreted by reference to another passage in which the same word appears ([[Talmudical Hermeneutics#Gezerah Shavah|Gezerah Shavah]]). The [[rabbi]]s did not ascribe equal persuasive power to the various principles.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., Rambam Hilkhot Talmud Torah 4:8&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Jewish hermeneutics differed from the Greek method in that the rabbis considered the [[Tanakh]] (the Jewish bibilical canon) to be without error. Any apparent inconsistencies had to be understood by means of careful examination of a given text within the context of other texts. There were different levels of interpretation: some were used to arrive at the plain meaning of the text, some expounded the law given in the text, and others found [[Esotericism|secret]] or [[Mysticism|mystical]] levels of understanding.

===Vedic hermeneutics===
{{Main|Mimamsa}}

Vedic hermeneutics involves the exegesis of the [[Vedas]], the earliest holy texts of [[Hinduism]]. The [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] was the leading hermeneutic school and their primary purpose was understanding what [[Dharma]] (righteous living) involved by a detailed hermeneutic study of the Vedas. They also derived the rules for the various rituals that had to be performed precisely.

The foundational text is the [[Mimamsa Sutras|Mimamsa Sutra]] of [[Jaimini]] (ca. 3rd to 1st century BCE) with a major commentary by [[Śabara]] (ca. the 5th or 6th century CE). The Mimamsa sutra summed up the basic rules for Vedic interpretation.

===Buddhist hermeneutics===
{{Main|Buddhist hermeneutics}}

Buddhist hermeneutics deals with the interpretation of the vast [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist literature]], particularly those texts which are said to be spoken by the [[Buddha]] ([[Buddhavacana]]) and other enlightened beings. Buddhist hermeneutics is deeply tied to Buddhist spiritual practice and its ultimate aim is to extract [[Upaya|skillful means]] of reaching spiritual enlightenment or [[nirvana]]. A central question in Buddhist hermeneutics is which Buddhist teachings are explicit, representing ultimate truth, and which teachings are merely conventional or relative.

===Biblical hermeneutics===
{{Main|Biblical hermeneutics}}
Biblical hermeneutics is the study of the principles of interpretation of the Bible. While Jewish and Christian biblical hermeneutics have some overlap, they have distinctly different interpretive traditions.

The early [[Church Fathers|patristic]] traditions of biblical [[exegesis]] had few unifying characteristics in the beginning but tended toward unification in later schools of biblical hermeneutics.

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] offers hermeneutics and [[homiletics]] in his ''[[De doctrina christiana]]''. He stresses the importance of humility in the study of Scripture. He also regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as the heart of Christian faith. In Augustine’s hermeneutics, signs have an important role. God can communicate with the believer through the signs of the Scriptures. Thus, humility, love, and the knowledge of signs are an essential hermeneutical presupposition for a sound interpretation of the Scriptures. Although Augustine endorses some teaching of the [[Platonism]] of his time, he corrects and recasts it according to a theocentric doctrine of the Bible. Similarly, in a practical discipline, he modifies the classical theory of oratory in a Christian way. He underscores the meaning of diligent study of the Bible and prayer as more than mere human knowledge and oratory skills. As a concluding remark, Augustine encourages the interpreter and preacher of the Bible to seek a good manner of life and, most of all, to love God and neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B. Hoon | title=Augustine’s Hermeneutics and Homiletics in De doctrina christianae | journal= Journal of Christian Philosophy | year=2013 | volume=17 | url=https://www.academia.edu/5228314/_Augustines_Hermeneutics_and_Homiletics_in_De_doctrina_christianae_Humiliation_Love_Sign_and_Discipline_Journal_of_Christian_Philosophy_17_2013_97-117 |pages=97–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are traditionally fourfold sense of biblical hermeneutics: literal, moral, allegorical (spiritual), and anagogical.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/hermeneutics-principles-of-biblical-interpretation Hermeneutics – Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Literal====
{{See also|Biblical literalism}}
Encyclopædia Britannica states that literal analysis means “a biblical text is to be deciphered according to the ‘plain meaning’ expressed by its linguistic construction and historical context.” The intention of the authors is believed to correspond to the literal meaning. Literal hermeneutics is often associated with the verbal inspiration of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics 2014"&gt;'Hermeneutics' 2014, Encyclopædia Britannica, Research Starters, EBSCOhost, viewed 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Moral====
Moral interpretation searches for moral lessons which can be understood from writings within the Bible. Allegories are often placed in this category.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics 2014"/&gt;

====Allegorical====
Allegorical interpretation states that biblical narratives have a second level of reference that is more than the people, events and things that are explicitly mentioned. One type of allegorical interpretation is known as [[typology (theology)|typological]], where the key figures, events, and establishments of the Old Testament are viewed as “types” (patterns). In the New Testament this can also include foreshadowing of people, objects, and events. According to this theory, readings like Noah’s Ark could be understood by using the Ark as a “type” of the Christian church that God designed from the start.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics 2014"/&gt;

====Anagogical====
This type of interpretation is more often known as mystical interpretation. It purports to explain the events of the Bible and how they relate to or predict what the future holds. This is evident in the [[Kabbalah|Jewish Kabbalah]], which attempts to reveal the mystical significance of the numerical values of [[Hebrew]] words and letters.

In Judaism, anagogical interpretation is also evident in the medieval [[Zohar]]. In Christianity, it can be seen in [[Mariology]].&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics 2014"/&gt;

==Philosophical hermeneutics==

===Ancient and medieval hermeneutics===
{{Main|History of hermeneutics}}

===Modern hermeneutics&lt;!-- 'Epistemological hermeneutics', 'Straussian hermeneutics', 'Radical hermeneutics', 'Romantic hermeneutics', 'Methodological hermeneutics', 'Ontological hermeneutics', 'Hermeneutic idealism', 'Hermeneutic realism', 'Analytic hermeneutics' and 'Engaged hermeneutics' redirect here--&gt;===
The discipline of hermeneutics emerged with the new [[Humanism|humanist]] education of the 15th&amp;nbsp;century as a historical and critical [[methodology]] for analyzing texts. In a triumph of early modern hermeneutics, the Italian humanist [[Lorenzo Valla]] proved in 1440 that the ''[[Donation of Constantine]]'' was a forgery. This was done through intrinsic evidence of the text itself. Thus hermeneutics expanded from its medieval role of explaining the true meaning of the Bible.

However, biblical hermeneutics did not die off. For example, the [[Protestant Reformation]] brought about a renewed interest in the interpretation of the Bible, which took a step away from the interpretive tradition developed during the Middle Ages back to the texts themselves. [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] emphasized ''scriptura sui ipsius interpres'' (scripture interprets itself). Calvin used ''brevitas et facilitas'' as an aspect of [[theological hermeneutics]].&lt;ref&gt;Myung Jun Ahn, "Brevitas et facilitas : a study of a vital aspect in the theological hermeneutics of John Calvin" [http://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/26944?show=full]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationalist [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] led hermeneutists, especially [[Protestant]] exegetists, to view Scriptural texts as secular classical texts. They interpreted Scripture as responses to historical or social forces so that, for example, apparent contradictions and difficult passages in the New Testament might be clarified by comparing their possible meanings with contemporary Christian practices.

[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834) explored the nature of understanding in relation not just to the problem of deciphering sacred texts but to all human texts and modes of communication.

The interpretation of a text must proceed by framing its content in terms of the overall organization of the work. Schleiermacher distinguished between grammatical interpretation and psychological interpretation. The former studies how a work is composed from general ideas; the latter studies the peculiar combinations that characterize the work as a whole. He said that every problem of interpretation is a problem of understanding and even defined hermeneutics as the art of avoiding misunderstanding. Misunderstanding was to be avoided by means of knowledge of grammatical and psychological laws.

During Schleiermacher's time, a fundamental shift occurred from understanding not merely the exact words and their objective meaning, to an understanding of the writer's distinctive character and point of view.&lt;ref name="ramberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermeneutics/|title=Hermeneutics|author1=Bjorn Ramberg|author2=Kristin Gjesdal|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th- and 20th-century hermeneutics emerged as a theory of understanding (''[[Verstehen]]'') through the work of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] ('''[[Jena Romanticism|Romantic]] hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Mueller-Vollmer]] (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CXY_h9rkUSUC&amp;dq= ''The Hermeneutics Reader''], Continuum, 1988, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''[[Scholarly method|methodological]] hermeneutics'''),&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Joseph Echeverria, ''Criticism and Commitment: Major Themes in Contemporary "Post-Critical" Philosophy'', Rodopi, 1981, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August Böckh]] (methodological hermeneutics),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M.

Regarding the relation of hermeneutics with problems of [[analytic philosophy]], there has been, particularly among analytic Heideggerians and those working on Heidegger’s [[philosophy of science]], an attempt to try and situate Heidegger's hermeneutic project in debates concerning [[Philosophical realism|realism]] and [[anti-realism]]: arguments have been presented both for Heidegger's '''hermeneutic idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the thesis that meaning determines [[reference]] or, equivalently, that our understanding of the being of entities is what determines entities as entities)&lt;ref&gt;Steven Galt Crowell, Jeff Malpas (eds.), ''Transcendental Heidegger'', Stanford University Press, 2007, pp. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt; and for Heidegger's '''hermeneutic realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubert L.

Dreyfus, Mark A. Wrathall (eds.), ''Heidegger Reexamined: Truth, realism, and the history of being'', Routledge, 2002, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Philosophers that worked to combine analytic philosophy with hermeneutics include [[Georg Henrik von Wright]] and [[Peter Winch]].  Roy J. Howard termed this approach '''analytic hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Roy J. Howard, ''Three Faces of Hermeneutics: An Introduction to Current Theories of Understanding'', University of California Press, 1982, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other contemporary philosophers influenced by the hermeneutic tradition include [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]&lt;ref name="ramberg" /&gt; ('''engaged hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aarde|first=Andries G.

====Dilthey (1833–1911)====
[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] broadened hermeneutics even more by relating interpretation to historical objectification. Understanding moves from the outer manifestations of human action and productivity to the exploration of their inner meaning. In his last important essay, "The Understanding of Other Persons and Their Manifestations of Life" (1910), Dilthey made clear that this move from outer to inner, from expression to what is expressed, is not based on [[empathy]]. Empathy involves a direct identification with the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]. Interpretation involves an indirect or mediated understanding that can only be attained by placing human expressions in their historical context. Thus, understanding is not a process of reconstructing the state of mind of the author, but one of articulating what is expressed in his work.

Dilthey divided sciences of the mind ([[human sciences]]) into three structural levels: experience, expression, and comprehension.

* Experience means to feel a situation or thing personally. Dilthey suggested that we can always grasp the meaning of unknown thought when we try to experience it. His understanding of experience is very similar to that of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Edmund Husserl]].
* Expression converts experience into meaning because the discourse has an appeal to someone outside of oneself. Every saying is an expression. Dilthey suggested that one can always return to an expression, especially to its written form, and this practice has the same objective value as an experiment in science. The possibility of returning makes scientific analysis possible, and therefore the humanities may be labeled as science. Moreover, he assumed that an expression may be "saying" more than the speaker intends because the expression brings forward meanings which the individual consciousness may not fully understand.
* The last structural level of the science of the mind, according to Dilthey, is comprehension, which is a level that contains both comprehension and incomprehension. Incomprehension means, more or less, ''wrong understanding''. He assumed that comprehension produces coexistence: "he who understands, understands others; he who does not understand stays alone."

====Heidegger (1889–1976)====
In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, [[Martin Heidegger]]'s philosophical hermeneutics shifted the focus from interpretation to [[Existentialism|existential]] understanding as rooted in fundamental ontology, which was treated more as a direct — and thus more authentic — way of being-in-the-world (''In-der-Welt-sein'') than merely as "a way of knowing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper and Row | last = Heidegger | first = Martin| title = Being and Time | origyear = 1927| year = 1962 }} p. H125&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he called for a "special hermeneutic of empathy" to dissolve the classic philosophic issue of "other minds" by putting the issue in the context of the being-with of human relatedness. (Heidegger himself did not complete this inquiry.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | last = Agosta| first = Lou | title = Empathy in the Context of Philosophy | year = 2010 }} p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of this approach claim that some texts, and the people who produce them, cannot be studied by means of using the same [[scientific method]]s that are used in the [[natural science]]s, thus drawing upon arguments similar to those of [[antipositivism]]. Moreover, they claim that such texts are conventionalized expressions of the experience of the author. Thus, the interpretation of such texts will reveal something about the [[social context]] in which they were formed, and, more significantly, will provide the reader with a means of sharing the experiences of the author.

The reciprocity between text and context is part of what Heidegger called the [[hermeneutic circle]]. Among the key thinkers who elaborated this idea was the [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Max Weber]].

====Gadamer (1900–2002) et al.====
[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]'s hermeneutics is a development of the hermeneutics of his teacher, Heidegger. Gadamer asserted that methodical contemplation is opposite to experience and reflection. We can reach the truth only by understanding or mastering our experience. According to Gadamer, our understanding is not fixed but rather is changing and always indicating new perspectives. The most important thing is to unfold the nature of individual understanding.

Gadamer pointed out that prejudice is an element of our understanding and is not ''per se'' without value. Indeed, prejudices, in the sense of pre-judgements of the thing we want to understand, are unavoidable. Being alien to a particular tradition is a condition of our understanding. He said that we can never step outside of our tradition — all we can do is try to understand it. This further elaborates the idea of the [[hermeneutic circle]].

[[Bernard Lonergan]]'s (1904–1984) hermeneutics is less well known, but a case for considering his work as the culmination of the [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] hermeneutical revolution that began with Heidegger was made in several articles by Lonergan specialist [[Frederick G. Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick G. Lawrence, "Martin Heidegger and the Hermeneutic Revolution", "Hans-Georg Gadamer and the Hermeneutic Revolution", "The Hermeneutic Revolution and Bernard Lonergan: Gadamer and Lonergan on Augustine's Verbum Cordis – the Heart of Postmodern Hermeneutics", "The Unknown 20th-Century Hermeneutic Revolution: Jerusalem and Athens in Lonergan's Integral
Hermeneutics", ''Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education'' 19/1–2 (2008) 7–30, 31–54, 55–86, 87–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Ricœur]] (1913–2005) developed a hermeneutics that is based upon Heidegger's concepts. His work differs in many ways from that of Gadamer.

[[Karl-Otto Apel]] (b. 1922) elaborated a hermeneutics based on American [[semiotics]]. He applied his model to [[discourse ethics]] with political motivations akin to those of [[critical theory]].

[[Jürgen Habermas]]  (b. 1929) criticized the conservatism of previous hermeneutists, especially Gadamer, because their focus on tradition seemed to undermine possibilities for social criticism and transformation. He also criticized [[Marxism]] and previous members of the [[Frankfurt School]] for missing the hermeneutical dimension of [[critical theory]].

Habermas incorporated the notion of the [[lifeworld]] and emphasized the importance for social theory of interaction, communication, labor, and production. He viewed hermeneutics as a dimension of critical social theory.

[[Andrés Ortiz-Osés]] (b. 1943) has developed his [[symbolic hermeneutics]] as the [[Southern Europe|Mediterranean]] response to [[Northern Europe]]an hermeneutics. His main statement regarding symbolic understanding of the world is that [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] is a [[symbol]]ic healing of injury.

Two other important hermeneutic scholars are [[Jean Grondin]] (b. 1955) and [[Maurizio Ferraris]] (b. 1956).

Mauricio Beuchot coined the term and discipline of [[analogic hermeneutics]], which is a type of hermeneutics that is based upon interpretation and takes into account the plurality of aspects of meaning. He drew categories both from analytic and continental philosophy, as well as from the [[Thought|history of thought]].

Two scholars who have published criticism of Gadamer's hermeneutics are the Italian jurist [[Emilio Betti]] and the American literary theorist [[E. D. Hirsch]].

====New hermeneutic====
[[New hermeneutic]] is the theory and methodology of interpretation to understand Biblical texts through [[existentialism]]. The essence of new hermeneutic emphasizes not only the existence of language but also the fact that language is eventualized in the history of individual life.&lt;ref&gt;(1999) Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation, R.N. Soulen, "Ernst Fuchs", by John Hayes, 422-423&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the event of language. [[Ernst Fuchs (theologian)|Ernst Fuchs]],&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Fuchs, Briefe an&amp;nbsp;Gerhard Ebeling, in: Festschrift aaO 48&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerhard Ebeling]], and [[James M. Robinson]] are the scholars who represent the new hermeneutics.

====Marxist hermeneutics&lt;!--'Marxist hermeneutics' redirects here--&gt;====
The method of '''Marxist hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; has been developed by the work of, primarily, [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. Benjamin outlines his theory of the allegory in his study ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama|Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels]]''&lt;ref name=Erasmus/&gt; ("Trauerspiel" literally means "mourning play" but is often translated as "tragic drama").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Verso | isbn = 978-1844673483 | last = Benjamin | first = Walter | title = Origin of the German Tragic Drama |year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fredric Jameson]] draws on Biblical hermeneutics, [[Ernst Bloch]],&lt;ref name=Kaufmann&gt;David Kaufmann, "Thanks for the Memory: Bloch, Benjamin and the Philosophy of History," in ''Not Yet: Reconsidering Ernst Bloch'', ed. Jamie Owen Daniel and Tom Moylan (London and New York: Verson, 1997), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of [[Northrop Frye]], to advance his theory of Marxist hermeneutics in his influential ''[[The Political Unconscious]]''. Jameson's Marxist hermeneutics is outlined in the first chapter of the book, titled "On Interpretation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cornell University Press | isbn = 978-0-8014-9222-8 | last = Jameson | first = Fredric | title = The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act |year = 1982 }} p. 17 - 102&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson re-interprets (and secularizes) the fourfold system (or four levels) of Biblical exegesis (literal; moral; allegorical; anagogical) to relate interpretation to the Mode of Production, and eventually, history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cornell University Press | isbn = 978-0801492846| last = Dowling | first = William C | title = Jameson, Althusser, Marx: Introduction to the Political Unconscious |year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Objective hermeneutics&lt;!--'Objective hermeneutics' redirects here--&gt;====
[[Karl Popper]] first used the term "'''objective hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;" in his ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] (ed.), ''Phenomenology of Life – From the Animal Soul to the Human Mind: Book II. The Human Soul in the Creative Transformation of the Mind'', Springer, 2007, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Association for Objective Hermeneutics]] (AGOH) was founded in [[Frankfurt am Main]] by scholars of various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Its goal is to provide all scholars who use the methodology of objective hermeneutics with a means of exchanging information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objective-hermeneutics.com Association for Objective Hermeneutics website.] Accessed: January 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the few translated texts of this German school of hermeneutics, its founders declared:

{{quote|Our approach has grown out of the empirical study of family interactions as well as reflection upon the procedures of interpretation employed in our research. For the time being we shall refer to it as objective hermeneutics in order to distinguish it clearly  from  traditional  hermeneutic  techniques  and orientations.  The  general  significance  for  sociological  analysis  of objective hermeneutics issues from the fact that, in the social sciences, interpretive methods constitute the fundamental procedures of measurement and of the generation of research data relevant to theory. From our perspective, the standard, nonhermeneutic  methods of quantitative social research can only be justified because they permit a shortcut in generating data (and research "economy" comes about under specific conditions). Whereas  the conventional methodological attitude in the social sciences justifies qualitative approaches as  exploratory or preparatory activities, to be succeeded by standardized approaches and techniques as the actual scientific procedures (assuring  precision, validity, and objectivity), we regard hermeneutic  procedures as the basic method for gaining precise and valid knowledge in the social  sciences. However, we do not simply reject alternative approaches dogmatically. They are in fact useful wherever the loss in precision and objectivity necessitated by the requirement of research economy can be condoned and tolerated in the light of prior hermeneutically elucidated research experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Oevermann, Ulrich; Tilman Allert, Elisabeth Konau, and Jürgen Krambeck. 1987.

==Applications==

===Archaeology===
{{POV section|date=July 2016}}
In [[archaeology]], hermeneutics means the interpretation and understanding of material through analysis of possible meanings and  social uses.

Proponents argue that interpretation of artifacts is unavoidably hermeneutic because we cannot know for certain the meaning behind them. We can only apply modern values when interpreting. This is most commonly seen in [[stone tool]]s, where descriptions such as "scraper" can be highly subjective and actually unproven until the development of [[microwear analysis]] some thirty years ago.

Opponents argue that a hermeneutic approach is too [[Relativism|relativist]] and that their own interpretations are based on [[Common sense|common-sense]] evaluation.

===Architecture===

There are several traditions of architectural scholarship that draw upon the hermeneutics of [[Heidegger]] and [[Gadamer]], such as [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], and [[Nader El-Bizri]] in the circles of  [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]]. Lindsay Jones examines the way architecture is received and how that reception changes with time and context (e.g., how a building is interpreted by critics, users, and historians).&lt;ref&gt;Jones, L. 2000. ''The Hermeneutics of Sacred Architecture: Experience, Interpretation, Comparison'', p.263;''Volume Two: Hermeneutical Calisthenics: A Morphology of Ritual-Architectural Priorities'', Cambridge Mass.: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dalibor Vesely]] situates hermeneutics within a critique of the application of overly scientific thinking to architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Vesely, D. 2004. ''Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation: The Question of Creativity in the Shadow of Production'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition fits within a critique of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]&lt;ref&gt;Perez-Gomez, A. 1985. ''Architecture and the Crisis of Modern Science'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and has also informed design-studio teaching. [[Adrian Snodgrass]] sees the study of history and Asian cultures by architects as a hermeneutical encounter with otherness.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, A., and Coyne, R. 2006. ''Interpretation in Architecture: Design as a Way of Thinking'', London: Routledge, pp 165–180.&lt;/ref&gt; He also deploys arguments from hermeneutics to explain design as a process of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, A., and Coyne, R. 2006. ''Interpretation in Architecture: Design as a Way of Thinking'', London: Routledge, pp. 29–55&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Richard Coyne]], he extends the argument to the nature of architectural education and design.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, A.B., and Coyne, R.D. 1992. "Models, Metaphors and the Hermeneutics of Designing." ''Design Issues'', 9(1): 56 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
[[Environmental hermeneutics]] applies hermeneutics to environmental issues conceived broadly to subjects including "[[nature]]" and "[[wilderness]]" (both terms are matters of hermeneutical contention), landscapes, ecosystems, built environments (where it overlaps architectural hermeneutics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mugerauer|first=Robert|title=Interpreting Environments|year=1995|publisher=University of Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mugerauer|first=Robert|title=Interpretations on Behalf of Place|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), inter-species relationships, the relationship of the body to the world, and more.

===International relations===
Insofar as hermeneutics is a basis of both [[critical theory]] and [[constitutive theory]] (both of which have made important inroads into the [[Postpositivism|postpositivist]] branch of [[international relations theory]] and [[political science]]), it has been applied to international relations.

[[Steve Smith (academic)|Steve Smith]] refers to hermeneutics as the principal way of grounding a [[Foundationalism (international relations)|foundationalist]] yet postpositivist theory of international relations.

Radical [[postmodernism]] is an example of a postpositivist yet [[Anti-foundationalism (international relations)|anti-foundationalist]] [[paradigm]] of international relations.

===Law===
{{Main|Jurisprudence|Law}}
Some scholars argue that law and theology are particular forms of hermeneutics because of their need to interpret legal tradition or scriptural texts. Moreover, the problem of interpretation has been central to [[Law#Legal theory|legal theory]] since at least the 11th&amp;nbsp;century.

In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Italian Renaissance]], the schools of ''[[glossator]]es'', ''commentatores'', and ''usus modernus'' distinguished themselves by their approach to the interpretation of "laws" (mainly [[Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]). The [[University of Bologna]] gave birth to a "legal Renaissance" in the 11th&amp;nbsp;century, when the Corpus Juris Civilis was rediscovered and systematically studied by men such as [[Irnerius]] and [[Decretum Gratiani#Author|Johannes Gratian]]. It was an interpretative Renaissance. Subsequently, these were fully developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Alberico Gentili]].

Since then, interpretation has always been at the center of legal thought. [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] and [[Emilio Betti]], among others, made significant contributions to general hermeneutics. [[Interpretivism (legal)|Legal interpretivism]], most famously [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s, may be seen as a branch of philosophical hermeneutics.

===Political philosophy===
Italian philosopher [[Gianni Vattimo]] and Spanish philosopher Santiago Zabala in their book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism]]'', when discussing contemporary capitalist regimes, stated that, "A politics of descriptions does not impose power in order to dominate as a philosophy; rather, it is functional for the continued existence of a society of dominion, which pursues truth in the form of imposition (violence), conservation (realism), and triumph (history)."&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala. ''Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx'' Columbia University Press. 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vattimo and Zabala also stated that they view [[Epistemological anarchism|interpretation as anarchy]] and affirmed that "existence is interpretation" and that "hermeneutics is weak thought."

=== Psychoanalysis ===
{{see also|Freud and Philosophy}}
Psychoanalysts have made ample use of hermeneutics since [[Sigmund Freud]] first gave birth to their discipline. In 1900 Freud wrote that the title he chose for ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' 'makes plain which of the traditional approaches to the problem of dreams I am inclined to follow...[''i.e.''] "interpreting" a dream implies assigning a "meaning" to it.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Interpretation of Dreams|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=The Hogarth Press|year=1900|isbn=|volume=Standard Edition, Vols. IV and V|location=London|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] later extended Freudian hermeneutics into other psychical realms. His early work from the 1930s–50s is particularly influenced by Heidegger, and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]'s hermeneutical phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.swingtradesystems.com/lacan/lacan-and-meaning-p51.html|title=Lacan and Meaning: Sexuation, Discourse Theory, and Topology in the Age of Hermeneutics.|last=Urban|first=William J.|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978-1530345502|location=New York|pages=51–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
{{See also|Postcognitivism}}

[[Psychology|Psychologists]] and [[Computer science|computer scientists]] have recently become interested in hermeneutics, especially as an alternative to [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].

[[Hubert Dreyfus]]'s critique of conventional [[artificial intelligence]] has been influential among psychologists who are interested in hermeneutic approaches to meaning and interpretation, as discussed by philosophers such as [[Martin Heidegger]] (cf. [[Embodied cognition]]) and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (cf. [[Discursive psychology]]).

Hermeneutics is also influential in [[humanistic psychology]].&lt;ref name=Rennie&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Hermeneutics and Humanistic Psychology|author= David L. Rennie |journal = The Humanistic Psychologist |year=2007 |volume=35|issue=1 |url= http://www.apa.org/divisions/div32/pdfs/hermeneutics.pdf|accessdate= 2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and theology===

The understanding of a [[Theology|theological]] [[Literature|text]] depends upon the reader's particular hermeneutical viewpoint. Some theorists, such as [[Paul Ricœur]], have applied modern philosophical hermeneutics to theological texts (in Ricœur's case, the Bible).

[[Mircea Eliade]], as a hermeneutist, understands religion as 'experience of the sacred', and interprets the sacred in relation to the profane.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Mircea (1987), ''The Sacred and the Profane: The Nature of Religion'', translated by Willard R. Trask. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian scholar underlines that the relation between the sacred and the profane is not of opposition, but of complementarity, having interpreted the profane as a [[hierophany]].&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2002), ''Introducere în hermeneutică'' (''Introduction to Hermeneutics''), Brașov: Orientul latin, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The hermeneutics of the myth is a part of the hermeneutics of religion. Myth should not be interpreted as an illusion or a lie, because there is truth in myth to be rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2007), ''The Hermeneutics of the Myth'', in ''Lumină lină'', number 3, New York, pages 33-49. {{ISSN|1086-2366}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Myth is interpreted by Mircea Eliade as 'sacred history'. He introduces the concept of 'total hermeneutics'.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Mircea (1978), ''La nostalgie des origines. Méthodologie et histoire des religions'', Paris: Editions Gallimard, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety science===
In the field of [[safety science]], and especially in the study of [[human reliability]], scientists have become increasingly interested in hermeneutic approaches.

It has been proposed by [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomist]] Donald Taylor that [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanist]] models of human behaviour will only take us so far in terms of accident reduction, and that safety science must look at the meaning of accidents for human beings.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1080/00140138108924870|title= The hermeneutics of accidents and safety|author= Donald Taylor |journal = Ergonomics |year=1981 | volume=24 |issue=6| pages=487–495 |url= http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/678312573-78650925/content~content=a775985337~db=all~order=page|accessdate= 2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars in the field have attempted to create safety [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] that make use of hermeneutic concepts in terms of their categorisation of [[qualitative data]].&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1177/0018726703056005004|title= Applied Hermeneutics and Qualitative Safety Data|author= Wallace,B., Ross, A., &amp; Davies, J.B. |journal = Human Relations |year=2003| volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=587–607 |url= http://hum.sagepub.com/content/56/5/587.abstract=page|accessdate= 2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
In [[sociology]], hermeneutics is the interpretation and understanding of social events through analysis of their meanings for the human participants in the events. It enjoyed prominence during the 1960s and 1970s, and differs from other interpretive schools of sociology in that it emphasizes the importance of both context&lt;ref&gt;Willis, W. J., &amp; Jost, M. (2007). Foundations of qualitative research; Interpretive and critical approaches. London: Sage. Page 106&lt;/ref&gt; and form within any given social behaviour.

The central principle of sociological hermeneutics is that it is only possible to know the meaning of an act or statement within the context of the discourse or [[world view]] from which it originates. Context is critical to comprehension; an action or event that carries substantial weight to one person or culture may be viewed as meaningless or entirely different to another. For example, giving the "thumbs-up" gesture is widely accepted as a sign of a job well done in the United States, while other cultures view it as an insult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacada.ksu.edu/Resources/Clearinghouse/View-Articles/body-speaks.aspx Kris Rugsaken, "Body Speaks: Body language around the world"]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, putting a piece of paper into a box might be considered a meaningless act unless it is put into the context of democratic elections (the act of putting a [[Ballot|ballot paper]] into a box).

[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], widely regarded as the father of sociological hermeneutics believed that, in order for an interpreter to understand the work of another author, they must familiarize themselves with the historical context in which the author published their thoughts. His work led to the inspiration of Heidegger's "[[hermeneutic circle]]" a frequently referenced model that claims one's understanding of individual parts of a text is based on their understanding of the whole text, while the understanding of the whole text is dependent on the understanding of each individual part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schleiermacher/#4 |title= Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher |last= Forster |first= Michael |publisher= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermeneutics in sociology was also heavily influenced by German philosopher [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Pressler, Fabio B. Dasilva, ''Sociology and Interpretation: From Weber to Habermas'', SUNY Press, 1996, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Jürgen Habermas]] criticizes [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer's]] hermeneutics as being unsuitable for understanding society because it is unable to account for questions of social reality, like labor and domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendelson|first=Jack|date=1979-01-01|title=The Habermas-Gadamer Debate|jstor=487850|journal=New German Critique|issue=18|pages=44–73|doi=10.2307/487850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Hans Hermann-Hoppe]], both economists of the [[Austrian school]], have criticized the hermeneutical approach to economics.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. 1989. "The Hermeneutical Invasion of Philosophy and Economics", in ''Economic Controversies'', pp. 119-136.

[[File:The Leading Hotels of the World.jpg|thumb|"Five-star superior" rating at the [[Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten Kempinski]] in [[Munich]], Germany]]
'''Hotel ratings''' are often used to classify [[hotel]]s according to their quality. From the initial purpose of informing travellers on basic facilities that can be expected, the objectives of hotel rating has expanded into a focus on the hotel experience as a whole.&lt;ref name="Hensens et al."&gt;{{cite web|last=Hensens, Struwig &amp; Dayan|title=Guest-review criteria on TripAdvisor compared to conventional hotel-rating systems to assess hotel quality|url=http://www.eurochrie2010.nl/publications/43.pdf|publisher=Eurochrie 2010|accessdate=18 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710073718/http://www.eurochrie2010.nl/publications/43.pdf#|archive-date=10 July 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the terms 'grading', 'rating', and 'classification' are used to generally refer to the same concept, that is to categorize hotels.

There is a wide variety of  rating schemes used by different organizations around the world. Many have a system involving [[Star (classification)|stars]], with a greater number of stars indicating greater luxury. [[Forbes]] Travel Guide, formerly [[Mobil]] Travel Guide, launched its star rating system in 1958. The [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] and their affiliated bodies use [[Lozenge|diamonds]] instead of stars to express hotel and restaurant ratings levels.

Food services, entertainment, view, room variations such as size and additional amenities, spas and fitness centers, ease of access and location may be considered in establishing a standard. Hotels are independently assessed in traditional systems and rest heavily on the facilities provided. Some consider this disadvantageous to smaller hotels whose quality of accommodation could fall into one class but the lack of an item such as an [[elevator]] would prevent it from reaching a higher categorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vine |first1=P.A.L. |date=March 1981 |title=Hotel classification; art or science? |journal=International Journal of Tourism Management |publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd. |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=18–29 |url= |doi=10.1016/0143-2516(81)90014-1 }} (Requires purchase of a document for $31.50)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standards of hotel classification ==
{{Confusing|section|reason=what is the difference between a "type" and a "standard"?|date=July 2018}}
The more common classification systems include "star" rating, letter grading, from "A" to "F", such as hotels and motels. Systems using terms such as Deluxe/Luxury, First Class/Superior, Tourist Class/Standard, and Budget Class/Economy are more widely accepted as hotel types, rather than hotel standard.{{By whom|date=July 2018}} 

Some countries have rating by a single public standard—Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Hungary have laws defining the hotel rating. In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the rating is defined by the respective hotel industry association using a five-star system—the German classifications are Tourist (*), Standard (**), Comfort (***), First Class (****) and Luxury (*****), with the mark "Superior" to flag extras beyond the minimum defined in the standard, but not enough to move the hotel up to the next tier ranking. The Swiss hotel rating was the first non-government formal hotel classification beginning in 1979.&lt;ref name="hotelleriesuisse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelsterne.ch/index.cfm?uuid=A0F5C6001143DAD1544A54A56FBBCDD4&amp;o_lang_id=2 |title="History &amp; development", hotelsterne.ch, accessed November 14, 2010, ''"In 1979, hotelleriesuisse (Swiss Hotel Association) introduced the hotel classification. This was the first and only worldwide private enterprise system of its kind. The system is internationally considered as exemplary, and has been repeatedly utilised as the basis for the development of a customised classification system (e.g. Germany, Austria)."'' |publisher=Hotelsterne.ch |date=1 June 2012 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced the hotel classification in Austria and Germany.&lt;ref name="hotelleriesuisse" /&gt; The formal hotel classification of the DEHOGA (German Hotel and Restaurant Association) started on 1 August 1996 and proved successful with 80% of guests citing the hotel stars as the main criteria in hotel selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelsterne.de/de/?newsID=33|title=Eine Erfolgsgeschichte: Zehn Jahre Deutsche Hotelklassifizierung|at=press release|publisher=hotelsterne.de|date=27 July 2006|accessdate=12 June 2012|quote="Am 1. August 2006 feiert die Deutsche Hotelklassifizierung ihr zehnjähriges Bestehen."'' – ''"80 Prozent der Gäste geben an, dass die Sterne Hauptkriterium bei der Hotelauswahl sind, denn sie bieten Transparenz und Sicherheit"}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implementation influenced the creation of a common European Hotelstars rating system that started in 2010 (see below).

In France, the rating is defined by the public tourist board Atout France using a four-star system (plus "L" for Luxus) which has changed to a five-star system from 2009 on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchkpi.com/hotel-rating-system-france/|title=Hotel Rating System in France: Categories and Map - FrenchKPI|author=|date=12 September 2014|website=frenchkpi.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, the [[Tourist Grading Council of South Africa]] has strict rules for a hotel types granting up to 5 stars. In India, the classification of hotels is based on two categories such as "Star" and "Heritage". Hotels in India are classified by Hotel and Restaurant Association Classification Committee (HRACC), Ministry of Tourism, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.in/TourismDivision/AboutDivision.aspx?Name=Hotels%20and%20Restaurants|title=Hotels and Restaurants|publisher=Government of India, Ministry of Tourism|date=29 May 2014|accessdate=29 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625072003/http://tourism.gov.in/TourismDivision/AboutDivision.aspx?Name=Hotels%20and%20Restaurants#|archive-date=25 June 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, hotels and other tourism services are graded by Qualmark, which is owned by [[Tourism New Zealand]], a government organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismnewzealand.com/news/qualmark-now-100-tourism-new-zealand-owned/ |title=Qualmark now 100% Tourism New Zealand owned |date=8 September 2015 |publisher=Tourism New Zealand |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hotel classifications by country ===

==== Australia ====
In Australia the independent accommodation rating scheme and Star Rating trademarks (the 'stars') are owned by the Australian Auto Clubs – the [[NRMA]], [[Royal Automobile Club of Victoria|RACV]], [[RACQ]], [[Royal Automobile Club of Australia|RAC]], RAA and RACT. A Star Rating represents the quality and condition of guest facilities and is determined by more than 200 criteria that have been ranked by Australian travellers according to what's important to them. Star Ratings are awarded to properties across six accommodation types – hotels, motels, serviced apartments, self-catering, hosted accommodation and caravan-holiday parks – following a physical inspection by qualified reviewers.

In 2015 Star Ratings Australia became one of the first independent accommodation classification systems in the world to incorporate a consumer 'voice'. An exclusive Travellers' Rating is presented in parallel to the independent Star Rating and is an aggregate of past guest ratings and reviews from more than 100 websites in 45 different languages. A property must have a minimum of 25 reviews (across all sites) to produce an aggregate Travellers' Rating. Weighting applies to the popularity of the source site and the date of the last guest review. The [[William Angliss Institute of TAFE|William Angliss Institute]] in Melbourne has developed an independent benchmarking framework to show if a property has met or exceeded guest expectations.

Star Ratings in Australia stand for independently reviewed quality standards and are easily defined:

On 28 February 2017, Michael Reed CEO Australian Motoring Services, advised clients via email of the closure of Star Ratings Australia effective from mid 2017.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Australia's star ratings have been operating since the 1950s first with the state based automobile clubs, then about 10 years ago with AAA Tourism as a peak body. However the booking service in the motoring clubs was not continued and later the annual accommodation guide book ceased to be printed with the accommodation guide going on-line. Finally AAA Tourism closed a few years ago and Star Ratings Australia continued the inspection and star rating service only, as well as the accommodation website. Reed asked clients to remove star rating and automobile club logos from their accommodation and promotional information by mid year. Competition from international websites lead to its demise.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom hotels are rated from one-star to five stars. The RAC pulled out of accommodation grading in 2008 so the only grading schemes in operation are those operated by [[The Automobile Association|the AA (Automobile Association)]] and the national tourist boards: Visit England, Visit Wales, the Scottish Tourist Board and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. The schemes were all 'harmonised' to ensure consistency between the schemes. This applies to all accommodation types apart from self-catering that the AA started offering in 2009. The AA criteria are available on its website.&lt;ref name="The AA Hotel Quality Standards"&gt;{{cite web|title=The AA Hotel Quality Standards|url=http://www.theaa.com/resources/Documents/pdf/business/hotel_services/aa_hotel_quality_standards.pdf |website=TheAA|publisher=The AA UK|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaa.com/travel_editorial/hotel_services_hotel_recognition_scheme.html |title=AA Hotel Recognition Scheme |publisher=Theaa.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the usual black stars (ranging from one (the lowest) to five (the highest), the AA awards red stars to the highest-rated, which are deemed 'Inspectors' Choice'. Each of the national tourist boards have grading explanations on their web sites.

==== Philippines ====
In the Philippines, the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]] has an accreditation system for hotels, apartment hotels and resorts. The current system which uses a "star system" which rates establishments from 1 to 5 stars was adopted in 2012.&lt;ref name="phtourism"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Accreditation Standards for Hotels, Resorts, and Apartment Hotels|url=http://www.tourism.gov.ph/Pages/20120615NewAccreditationStandardsforHotelsResortsand.aspx|website=Philippine Tourism|publisher=Department of Tourism (Philippines)|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rating of the aforementioned facilities are determined through a points system. Hotels, apartment hotels, and resorts are graded according to their service, facility quality and condition, and business practices. The Department of Tourism classifies the criteria used into seven dimensions or "business area" namely: Arrival &amp; Departure, Public Areas, Bedrooms, Food &amp; Beverage, Lounge Area, Kitchen Area, Amenities, and Business Practices, all common to the three categories except Kitchen and Lounge Area which is only applicable to apartment hotels. 1,000 points is the maximum number of points an establishment can attain.&lt;ref name=nasph&gt;{{cite book|title=National Accommodation Standards – Hotel|date=May 2012|publisher=Department of Tourism (Philippines)|pages=v-45|url=http://www.tourism.gov.ph/Downloadable%20Files/Hotel%20for%20web.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Hotelstars Union ===
The HOTREC (Hotels, Restaurants &amp; Cafés in Europe) is an umbrella organization for 39 associations from 24 European countries. At a conference in Bergen in 2004, the partners drafted a hotel classification system in order to harmonize their national standards. In 2007 HOTREC launched the European Hospitality Quality scheme (EHQ) which has since accredited the existing national inspection bodies for hotel rating.

Under the patronage of HOTREC, the hotel associations of Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland created the '''Hotelstars Union'''.&lt;ref name="hotelstars.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotelstars.eu |title=HOTELSTARS UNION – About us (English) |publisher=Hotelstars.eu |date= |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 September 2009, the Hotelstars Union classification system was established at a conference in Prague. This system became effective in these countries in January 2010, with the exception of Hungary, Switzerland and the Netherlands, who have chosen later dates for the change. Later more countries have joined the HOTREC hotelstars system: Estonia (2011), Latvia (2011), Lithuania (2011), Luxembourg (2011), Malta (2012), Belgium (2013), Denmark (2013) and Greece (2013).

The European Hotelstars Union system is based on the earlier German hotelstars system that had widely influenced the hotel classifications in central Europe, with five stars and a Superior mark to flag extras. Instead of a strict minimum in room size and required shower facilities (e.g. a bath tub in a four-star hotel) there is a catalogue of criteria with 21 qualifications encompassing 270 elements, where some are mandatory for a star and others optional. The main criteria are in quality management, wellness and sleeping accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelstars.eu/en/index.php?open=Criteria |title=HOTELSTARS UNION – Criteria (English) |publisher=Hotelstars.eu |date= |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the catalogue of criteria each entry is associated with a number of points – each Hotelstars level requires a minimal sum of points besides some criteria being obligatory for the level.&lt;ref name="hotelstars-criteria" /&gt; The minimum requirement for the Superior flag requires the same sum of points as for the next Hotelstars level which however was not awarded due to at least one obligatory requirement being left out.&lt;ref name="hotelstars-criteria"&gt;[http://hotelstars.eu/userfiles/files/en/downloads/Criteria_2010-2014.pdf Hotelstars – Catalogue of Criteria]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, see last page: (*) 90 minimum + 80 superior = (**) 170 minimum + 80 superior = (***) 250 minimum + 130 superior = (****) 380 minimum + 190 superior = (*****) 570 minimum + 80 superior – maximum points for all criteria: 860&lt;/ref&gt;

For hotels with three to five stars, the Hotelstars Union will use "mystery guests" to check the service quality regularly.

== World hotel rating ==
{{update|section|date=June 2012}}
There is so far no international classification which has been adopted. There have been attempts at unifying the classification system so that it becomes an internationally recognized and a reliable standard, but they have all failed.

It has been considered that, as it has been the case in other areas (e.g. international accounting standards), hotel classification standards should result from a private and independent initiative. This may be the case of the World Hotel Rating (WHR) project, which notably aims to set international classification standards and rating criteria along the lines of a world star-rating system. It will also establish an information platform on the hotel industry which will be multilingual and multicultural. WHR intends to play a key role in the development of quality hotel services, as well as equitable and [[sustainable tourism]], and the protection of the world's cultural and natural heritage. In addition, WHR will develop labels to promote hotels distinguished by specific features, such as a family and child-friendly disposition. A test period was scheduled for 2010.

== More than five stars ==
Some hotels have been advertised as seven star hotels. The [[Burj Al Arab]] hotel in [[Dubai]] was opened in 1998 with a butler for every room – this has been the first hotel being widely described as a "seven-star" property, but the hotel says the label originates from an unnamed British journalist on a press trip and that they neither encourage its use nor do they use it in their advertising. Similarly the [[Emirates Palace Hotel]] in Abu Dhabi (open since 2005) is sometimes described as seven star as well, but the hotel uses only a five star rating.

The [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II|Galleria]] in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] was opened in 2007 and it claims to have a seven star certificate from SGS Italy2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sevenstarsgalleria.com/philosophy/the-7-stars|title=Luxury five star Rooms in Milan – TownHouse Galleria|author=|date=|website=TownHouse Hotels|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the SGS Italy (not the official tourism agency) only has five stars in the general hotel stars categorization, with the full title of the certificate being left unknown, just as the renewal process is unknown. Overall, as no traditional organization or formal body awards or recognizes any rating over five-star deluxe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iSmdUhax3kuhARWAz15zshTN9Dew?docId=CNG.dfd1843a9cc600850b4d12dd7048131d.141 |title=AFP: China plans $1.3bn 'seven-star hotel' |publisher=[[Google.com]] |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; such claims are meaningless and predominantly used for advertising purposes.

Historically, luxury hotels have used the membership in [[The Leading Hotels of the World]] to document regular inspection on an additional level. This organization had been formed in 1928 and it reorganized in 1971 introducing a worldwide inspection service.

== Alternative Hotel Ratings ==
In recent years, alternative hotel ratings are starting to appear in an effort to promote sustainability or cultural diversity in international tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iecs.ulbsibiu.ro/IECS2010/section1/Rovinaru%20M,%20Rovinaru%20F.pdf |title=Managing cultural diversity in international tourism |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Minnesota Vikings offense in a huddle.jpg|thumb|The [[Minnesota Vikings]] offense in a huddle, September 2012]]
[[File:Victory huddle.jpg|thumb|right|250px|England huddle to celebrate victory over India in Mumbai, March 2006]]

In [[sport]], a '''huddle''' is an action of a team gathering together, usually in a tight circle, to strategize, motivate or celebrate.  It is a popular strategy for keeping opponents insulated from sensitive information, and acts as a form of insulation when the level of noise in the venue is such that normal on-field communication is difficult.  Commonly the leader of the huddle is the team captain and it is the captain who will try to inspire other team members to achieve success. Similarly after an event a huddle may take place to congratulate one another for the teams success, or to commiserate a defeat.  The term "huddle" can be used as a verb as in "huddling up."

The huddle is commonly used in [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]] to strategize before each play; the offensive team's huddle is almost always led by the [[quarterback]], and the defensive huddle is typically led by one of the [[linebacker]]s.  It is also popular in [[basketball]], [[football (soccer)|football]], [[volleyball]] and [[cricket]].

The huddle became more widely used in cricket after the [[India national cricket team|India national team]] used it to great success during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. The [[England cricket team|England team]] has imitated this technique with some success, notably in the [[2005 Ashes series|2005]] [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series.

==Types==

===Circular===
[[File:Huddle (Baker at Ottawa) (cropped).JPG|thumb|[[Baker Wildcats]] huddle up during a game]]
The modern-day circular huddle, in which the players all face inward in a tight circle, was invented by [[Gallaudet University]] quarterback [[Paul D. Hubbard]] in 1894. Gallaudet was among the first schools intended for the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students, and the first intended for their postsecondary education. When quarterbacking, Hubbard realized that his hand signals could be read by opposing players, a particular concern when Gallaudet played other schools for the deaf. To remedy this, he had his players form a circle so that his sign-language signals could be sent and received without anyone on the sidelines or on the opposing team seeing.&lt;ref name=Hubbard&gt;Gannon, Jack. 1981. ''Deaf Heritage: Narrative History of Deaf America'', Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, pp. 272, 276 ([http://studentunitymovement.org/Deaf_Heritage_by_Jack_Gannon_page_272.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of huddle is still in common use today, typically between plays in American Football as the quarterback assigns the next play to the offense.

===Typewriter===
The typewriter huddle is a huddle formation created by former [[Florida State]] Head Coach [[Tom Nugent]] in the mid-1950s. It is typically used between a coach and multiple players, or when a quarterback or other player wants to create an image of being separate from the team, dictating to them, rather than being a part of the group, as with the circular huddle. The players being spoken to are arranged in two or more rows, the front row often kneeling or crouching. The player or coach speaking can then be assured that he has the attention of the entire audience, something that often is not possible if that person is in the center of a circular huddle. Though allowing players breathing room and providing space for more participants than a circular huddle, it is not as secure, as observers on the sidelines may be able to see hand signals or read the speaker's lips.

== American football ==
In [[American football]], though seemingly random, huddles can have several forms. Before the 1890s, football players didn’t form huddles; they instead discussed the play far enough from the other team that they could not be overheard. As American football became more organized and formalized, so too did the huddle.&lt;ref name="Erick"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Streelman|first1=Erick (4 August 2015)|title=No Huddle Communication|url=http://winwiththepass.com/no-huddle-communication/|website=Win With The Pass|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huddle 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers.jpg|thumb|left|400px|link=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Huddle_2005_Pittsburgh_Steelers.jpg|Pittsburgh Steelers in an NFL huddle.  Offensive players gather in a rough circle out of hearing of the opposing defense to plan the next play.]]

The football team at [[Oregon State Beavers|Oregon Agricultural College]] was one of the very first schools nationally to use the huddle formation in a game.  It happened against the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]] during the 1918 season.  Head coach [[Homer Woodson Hargiss|Bill Hargiss]] instructed the [[Starting lineup|starters]] that once they returned to the field, they were to stand 10 yards behind the ball before the beginning of each play and whisper to one another what they were going to do next.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv11/CFHSNv11n2c.pdf#2&lt;/ref&gt;  An eyewitness to the game was veteran Seattle sports columnist [[Royal Brougham]], whose stories of the contest give testimony today to the program's early use of this pioneering new formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberheide.org/hargiss/Huddle/First%20use%20huddle.htm|title=Bill Hargiss - First Use of the Offensive huddle, 1918|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others trace the huddle to the 1890s in [[Gallaudet University|Gallaudet College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Okrent|first=Arika|title=The true origin story of the football huddle|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/255892/the-true-origin-story-of-the-football-huddle|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Week]]|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of its use was when the huddle was formed by Paul Hubbard, a deaf player who went to [[Gallaudet University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] To avoid having the other team see his sign language between plays, he and his team huddled to conceal the signs.&lt;ref name=Hubbard/&gt;

During a game, the quarterback uses the huddle to [[Play calling system|communicate the next play]] to the offense. [[National Football League]] Rule 5 Section 2 stipulates that no more than eleven players may be in the offensive huddle. An offensive substitute who communicates with a teammate in a huddle would be penalized for "unsportsmanlike conduct"; this is to prevent teams from feigning a substitution and taking advantage of the chaos to confuse opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OFFICIAL NFL PLAYING RULES — Rule 5 Players, Substitutes, Equipment, General Rules|url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/rulebook/pdfs/8_Rule5_Players_Subs_Equip_GeneralRules.pdf|publisher=[[National Football League]]|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some situations, teams may choose not to call a huddle and employ a [[Hurry-up offense|hurry-up no-huddle offense]] to maximize time and surprise the defense.

=== Snap (gridiron football) ===
In a [[Snap (gridiron football)|snap]], the snap count is decided on in the huddle, usually expressed as "...on &lt;number&gt;." being the final words spoken by the quarterback after calling the play but before the huddle breaks and the players go to the line of scrimmage. The snap count allows offensive players to have a small head start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-quarterbacks-call-plays-and-audibilize-during-.html|title=How Quarterbacks Call Plays and Audibilize during Football Games|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association football==

[[File:HuddleSevilleedit.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Celtic do their customary huddle before the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup final, 2003]]]]

In [[Association football]] (soccer), the huddle has been used before games by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] national teams and club teams such as [[Derry City FC]]. [[Celtic FC]] from [[Scotland]] have used the huddle as a pre-match ritual since 1995, although this was pre-dated by [[St. Mirren FC]] (also from [[Scotland]]) who had been using the huddle since 1993. Celtic copied this and in turn is now carried out by all levels and ages of the Celtic club and often imitated by the supporters. The supporting visual aspect of this, although culturally unrelated can also be seen as similar to [[The Poznan]].

==Australian football==
In contrast to other sports, the huddle is a specific tactic in [[Australian rules football|Australian football]], used by the team kicking in after a [[Laws of Australian football#Scoring|behind is scored]], or some delayed stoppage. All players in the [[backline (football)|backline]] gather together about fifty meters from goal. Then, the players individually lead away from the huddle in all directions. The technique means that there will be several leading players, making it difficult to defend the first kick-in. It also allows teams to run set plays for the second and third kicks. The huddle was developed during the 1970s, and is still used today by many teams.

Indonesia is the fourth most [[list of countries by population|populous nation]] in the world. Of its large population, the majority speak Indonesian, making it one of the most [[list of languages by number of native speakers|widely spoken]] languages in the world.&lt;ref name="The Indonesian Language 2004. Page 14"&gt;[[James Neil Sneddon]]. ''The Indonesian Language: Its History and Role in Modern Society''. UNSW Press, 2004. Page 14."&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Indonesians, aside from speaking the national language, are fluent in at least one of the more than 700 indigenous [[languages of Indonesia|local languages]]; examples include [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] and [[Balinese language|Balinese]], which are commonly used at home and within the local community.&lt;ref name="policy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/10/28/indigenous-language-policy-a-national-cultural-strategy.html |title=Indigenous language policy as a national cultural strategy |author=Setiono Sugiharto |date=28 October 2013 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/I/I08/I08-7014.pdf |title=Resources Report on Languages of Indonesia |author=Hammam Riza |year=2008 |accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most formal [[education]], and nearly all national [[mass media]], [[governance]], [[Public administration|administration]], [[judiciary]], and other forms of communication, are conducted in Indonesian.&lt;ref name="hawaii.edu"&gt;http://www.hawaii.edu/sealit/Downloads/The%2520Indonesian%2520Language.doc{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early kingdoms era ===
[[File:Kerinci MSS detail.jpg|thumb|[[Rencong alphabet]], native writing systems found in central and [[South Sumatra]] and Malay Peninsula. The text reads (Voorhoeve's spelling): "haku manangis ma / njaru ka'u ka'u di / saru tijada da / tang [hitu hadik sa]", which is translated by Voorhoeve as: "I am weeping, calling you; though called, you do not come" (in modern Malay "Aku menangis, menyeru kau, kau di seru, tiada datang [itu adik satu]").]]

It might be attributed to its [[ancestor]], the [[Old Malay]] language (which can be traced back to the 7th century). The [[Kedukan Bukit Inscription]] is the oldest surviving specimen &lt;span lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; Old Malay, the language used by [[Srivijayan]] empire. Since the 7th century, the Old Malay language has been used in [[Nusantara]] (Indonesian archipelago), evidenced by Srivijaya inscriptions and by other inscriptions from [[coast]]al areas of the archipelago, such as [[Sojomerto inscription|those discovered in Java]].

=== Old Malay as ''[[lingua franca]]'' ===
[[Trade]] contacts carried on by various [[ethnic group|ethnic]] peoples at the time were the main [[vehicle]] for spreading the Old Malay language, which was the main [[communications]] medium among the traders. Ultimately, the Old Malay language became a [[lingua franca]] and was spoken widely by most people in the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/article/read/174/sriwijaya-dalam-telaah |title=Sriwijaya dalam Tela'ah |date=5 June 2007 |publisher=Melayu Online |accessdate=1 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022105208/http://melayuonline.com/ind/article/read/174/sriwijaya-dalam-telaah |archive-date=22 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://melayuonline.com/eng/opinion/read/80/risen-up-maritime-nation |title=Risen Up Maritime Nation! |author=Bambang Budi Utomo |date=23 January 2008 |publisher=Melayu Online |accessdate=1 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022091319/http://melayuonline.com/eng/opinion/read/80/risen-up-maritime-nation |archive-date=22 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indonesian (in its normative form) has essentially the same material basis as the standard [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] register of Malay, and is therefore considered to be a variety of the pluricentric Malay language. However, it does [[Comparison of Standard Malay and Indonesian|differ]] from Malaysian Malay in several respects, with differences in pronunciation and vocabulary. These differences are due mainly to the Dutch and Javanese influences on Indonesian. Indonesian was also influenced by the {{lang|id|Melayu pasar}} (literally "market Malay"), which was the lingua franca of the archipelago in colonial times, and thus indirectly by other spoken languages of the islands.

Malaysian Malay claims to be closer to the classical Malay of earlier centuries, even though modern Malaysian has been heavily influenced, in lexicon as well as in syntax, by English. The question of whether High Malay (Court Malay) or Low Malay (Bazaar Malay) was the true parent of the Indonesian language is still in debate. High Malay was the official language used in the court of the [[Johor Sultanate]] and continued by the Dutch-administered territory of [[Riau-Lingga]], while Low Malay was commonly used in marketplaces and ports of the archipelago. Some linguists have argued that it was the more common Low Malay that formed the base of the Indonesian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1626/bahasa-indonesia-memasyarakatkan-kembali-bahasa-pasar |title=Bahasa Indonesia: Memasyarakatkan Kembali 'Bahasa Pasar'? |publisher=Melayu Online |accessdate=29 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630131527/http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1626/bahasa-indonesia-memasyarakatkan-kembali-bahasa-pasar |archive-date=30 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dutch colonial era ===
When the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) first arrived in the archipelago, the Malay language was a significant trading and political language due to the influence of [[Malacca Sultanate|Malaccan Sultanate]] and later the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. However, the language had never been dominant among the population of the Indonesian archipelago as it was limited to mercantile activity. The VOC adopted the Malay language as the administrative language of their trading outpost in the east. Following the [[bankruptcy]] of the VOC, the [[Batavian Republic]] took control of the colony in 1799 and it was only then that education in and promotion of Dutch began in the [[colony]]. Even then, Dutch administrators were remarkably reluctant to promote the use of Dutch compared to other colonial regimes. Dutch thus remained the language of a small elite: in 1940, only 2% of the total population could speak Dutch. Nevertheless, it did have a significant influence on the development of Malay in the colony: during the era of [[colonization]] the language that would be standardized as Indonesian absorbed a large amount of Dutch vocabulary in the form of [[loanwords]].

=== Birth of the Indonesian language ===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Opening van de Volksraad door gouverneur-generaal Van Limburg Stirum op 18 mei 1918 op Java TMnr 10001373.jpg|thumb|''[[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]]'' session held in July 1938 in Jakarta, where Indonesian was formally used for the first time by Jahja Datoek Kajo.]]

The [[Indonesian National Awakening|nationalist movement]] that ultimately brought Indonesian to its national language status rejected [[Dutch language|Dutch]] from the outset. However, the rapid disappearance of Dutch was a very unusual case compared with other colonized countries, where the colonial language generally has continued to function as the language of politics, [[bureaucracy]], education, [[technology]], and other important areas for a significant time after independence.&lt;ref name="Swaan"/&gt; Soenjono Dardjowidjojo even goes so far as to say that "Indonesian is perhaps the only language that has achieved the status of a national language in its true sense" since it truly dominates in all spheres of [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian society]]. The ease with which Indonesia eliminated the language of its former colonial power can perhaps be explained as much by Dutch [[policy]] as by Indonesian nationalism, though. In marked contrast to the [[France|French]], [[Spain|Spanish]] and Portuguese, who pursued an [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] colonial policy, or even the [[British Empire|British]], the Dutch did not attempt to spread their language among the indigenous population. In fact, they consciously prevented the language from being spread by refusing to provide education, especially in Dutch, to the native Indonesians so they would not come to see themselves as equals.&lt;ref name="Swaan"/&gt; Moreover, the Dutch wished to prevent the Indonesians from elevating their perceived social status by taking on elements of Dutch culture. Thus, until the 1930s, they maintained a minimalist regime and allowed Malay to spread quickly throughout the archipelago.

Dutch dominance at that time covered nearly all aspects, with official forums requiring the use of Dutch, although since the Youth Congress (1928) the use of Indonesian as the national language was agreed on as one of the tools in the pro-independence struggle. As of it, [[Mohammad Husni Thamrin]] inveighed actions underestimating Indonesian. After some criticism and protests, the use of Indonesian was allowed since the ''Volksraad'' sessions held in July 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/indolang/malay.html|title=The Indonesian Language – Bahasa Indonesia|date=8 May 2005|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508115242/http://www.hawaii.edu/indolang/malay.html|archivedate=8 May 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time they tried to counter the spread of Malay by teaching Dutch to the natives, it was too late, and in 1942, the Japanese conquered Indonesia and outlawed the use of the Dutch language. Three years later, the Indonesians themselves formally abolished the language and established ''Bahasa Indonesia'' as the national language of the new nation.&lt;ref name="Paauw"/&gt;

=== Adoption as national language ===
[[File:Youthpledge.jpg|thumb|''The Pledge'' was the result of second [[Youth Pledge]] held in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in October 1928. On the last pledge, there was an affirmation of Indonesian language as a ''unifying language'' throughout the archipelago.]]

The adoption of Indonesian as the country's national language was in contrast to most other post-colonial states, as neither the language with the most native speakers (in this case, Javanese) nor the language of the former European colonial power (in this case, Dutch) was to be adopted, but rather a local language with many fewer native speakers than the most widely spoken local language (nevertheless, Malay was the second most widely spoken language in the colony after Javanese, and had many L2 speakers using it for trade, administration, and education).

In 1945 when Indonesia declared its independence, Indonesian was formally declared the national language,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=History of Indonesian Language |publisher=Language Translation, Inc. |url=http://www.languagetranslation.com/translation/languages/indonesian-translation4.html |accessdate=12 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043125/http://www.languagetranslation.com/translation/languages/indonesian-translation4.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; although then it was the native language of only about 5 per cent of the population, whereas Javanese and Sundanese were the [[first language|mother tongues]] of 42–48 percent and 15 percent respectively.&lt;ref name="Kratz"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kratz |first=U. |title=Indonesia: language situation |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Language &amp; Linguistics |edition=Second |year=2006 |pages=639–641 |doi=10.1016/B0-08-044854-2/01720-X|chapter=Indonesia * : Language Situation |isbn=9780080448541 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a combination of [[nationalism|nationalistic]], [[politics|political]], and [[pragmatism|practical]] concerns that ultimately led to the successful adoption of Indonesian as a national language.
In 1945, Javanese was easily the most prominent language in Indonesia. It was the native language of nearly half the population, the primary language of politics and [[economics]], and the language of [[court]]ly, [[religion|religious]], and literary tradition.&lt;ref name="Swaan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Swaan |first1=Abram |title=Words of the World |date=2001 |publisher=Polity |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0745627489 |pages=81–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; What it lacked, however, was the ability to unite the diverse Indonesian population as a whole. With thousands of islands and hundreds of different languages, the newly independent country of Indonesia had to find a national language that could realistically be spoken by the majority of the population and that would not divide the nation by favoring one ethnic group, namely the Javanese, over the others. In 1945, Indonesian was already in widespread use;&lt;ref name=Kratz/&gt; in fact, it had been for roughly a thousand years. Over that long period of time, Malay, which would later become standardized as Indonesian, was the primary language of [[commerce]] and [[travel]]. In addition, it was the language used for the propagation of [[Islam]] in the 13th to 17th centuries, as well as the language of instruction used by Portuguese and Dutch missionaries attempting to convert the indigenous people to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Swaan/&gt; The combination of all of these factors meant that the language was already known to some degree by most of the population, and it could be more easily adopted as the national language than perhaps any other. Moreover, it was the language of the sultanate of [[Brunei]] and of the future [[Malaysia]], on which some Indonesian nationalists had claims (see [[Greater Indonesia]]).

Over the first 53 years of [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]], the country's first two presidents, [[Sukarno]] and [[Suharto]] constantly nurtured the sense of national [[wikt:unity|unity]] embodied by Indonesian, and the language remains an important component of Indonesian identity today. Through a language planning program that made Indonesian the language of [[politics]], [[education]], and nation-building in general, Indonesia became one of the few success stories of an [[indigenous language]] effectively overtaking that of a country's colonizers to become the ''[[de jure]]'' and ''[[de facto]]'' official language.&lt;ref name="Paauw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paauw|first1=Scott|title=One Land, One Nation, One Language: An Analysis of Indonesia's National Language Policy|journal=University of Rochester Working Papers in the Language Sciences|date=2009|volume=5|issue=1|pages=2–16|url=http://www.rochester.edu/college/cls/assets/pdf/working/Paauw.pdf|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a unique and somewhat unusual story, especially considering the historical dominance of Javanese; a diverse collection of peoples were able to compromise to hold the nation together. Today, Indonesian continues to function as the language of [[national identity]] as the Congress of Indonesian Youth envisioned, and it also serves as the language of education, [[literacy]], [[modernization theory|modernization]], and [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="Paauw" /&gt; Despite still being a second language to most Indonesian citizens, it is unquestionably the language of the Indonesian nation as a whole, as it has had unrivaled success as a factor in nation-building and the strengthening of Indonesian identity.

=== Modern and colloquial Indonesian ===
{{further information|Indonesian slang language}}

While Indonesian is spoken as a [[mother tongue]] by only a small proportion of Indonesia's large population (i.e. mainly those who reside within the vicinity of [[Jakarta]] and other large predominantly Indonesian-speaking cities such as [[Medan]] and [[Balikpapan]]), over 200 million people regularly make use of the national language, with varying degrees of proficiency. In a nation that boasts more than 700 native languages and a vast array of ethnic groups, it plays an important unifying and cross-archipelagic role for the country. Use of the national language is abundant in the media, [[government]] bodies, [[school]]s, [[University|universities]], [[workplace]]s, among members of the Indonesian upper-class or nobility and also in many other formal situations, although the 2010 Indonesian Census shows that only 19.94% of people over 5 years old speak mainly Indonesian at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sp2010.bps.go.id/files/ebook/kewarganegaraan%20penduduk%20indonesia/index.html | title=Publication Name}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard and formal Indonesian is used in books and newspapers and on television/radio news broadcasts; however, few native Indonesian speakers use the formal language in their daily conversations. While this is a phenomenon common to most languages in the world (for example, spoken English does not always correspond to its written standards), the proximity of spoken Indonesian (in terms of grammar and vocabulary) to its normative form is noticeably low. This is mostly due to Indonesians combining aspects of their own local languages (e.g., [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], [[Balinese language|Balinese]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]) with Indonesian. This results in various vernacular varieties of Indonesian, the very types that a foreigner is most likely to hear upon arriving in any Indonesian city or town. This phenomenon is amplified by the use of [[Indonesian slang]], particularly in the cities.

The most common and widely used colloquial Indonesian is heavily influenced by the [[Betawi language]], a [[Malay trade and creole languages|Malay-based creole]] of [[Jakarta]], amplified by its popularity in Indonesian popular culture in mass media and Jakarta's status as the national capital. In informal spoken Indonesian, various words are replaced with those of a less formal nature. For example, {{lang|id|tidak}} (no) is often replaced with the Betawi form {{lang|id|nggak}} or the even simpler {{lang|id|gak}}, while {{lang|id|seperti}} (like, similar to) is often replaced with {{lang|jv|kayak}} (pronounced ''kai-yah''). {{lang|id|Sangat}} or {{lang|id|amat}} (very), the term to express intensity, is often being replaced with the Javanese-influenced {{lang|id|banget}}.

As for pronunciation, the diphthongs ''ai'' and ''au'' on the end of base words are typically pronounced as {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}. In informal writing the spelling of words is modified to reflect the actual pronunciation in a way that can be produced with less effort. For example, {{lang|id|capai}} becomes {{lang|id|cape}} or {{lang|id|capek}}, {{lang|id|pakai}} becomes {{lang|id|pake}}, {{lang|id|kalau}} becomes {{lang|id|kalo}}.

In verbs, the prefix ''me-'' is often dropped, although an initial nasal consonant is often retained, as when {{lang|id|mengangkat}} becomes {{lang|id|ngangkat}} (the basic word is {{lang|id|angkat}}). The suffixes ''-kan'' and ''-i'' are often replaced by ''-in''. For example, {{lang|id|mencarikan}} becomes {{lang|id|nyariin}}, {{lang|id|menuruti}} becomes {{lang|id|nurutin}}. The latter grammatical aspect is one often closely related to the Indonesian spoken in Jakarta and its surrounding areas.

Indonesian is one of the many varieties of [[Malay language|Malay]]. Malay historical linguists agree on the likelihood of the Malay homeland being in western [[Borneo]] stretching to the [[Brunei]]an coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=K.

Its ancestor, [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian]], a descendant of the [[Proto-Austronesian language]], began to break up by at least 2000 BCE, possibly as a result of the southward expansion of [[Austronesian peoples]] into [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] from the island of [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last = Andaya | first = Leonard Y. | title = The Search for the 'Origins' of Melayu | journal = Journal of Southeast Asian Studies |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=315–330 | year = 2001 | url = http://sabrizain.org/malaya/library/search.pdf | doi=10.1017/s0022463401000169 |jstor=20072349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian, which originated from Malay, is a member of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family of languages, which includes languages from [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]], with a smaller number in continental [[Asia]]. [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], a geographic outlier spoken in [[Madagascar]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]; the Philippines national language, [[Filipino language|Filipino]]; and the native language of New Zealanders, [[Māori language]] are also members of this language family. Although each language of the family is mutually unintelligible, their similarities are rather striking. Many roots have come virtually unchanged from their common ancestor, [[Proto-Austronesian language]]. There are many [[cognate]]s found in the languages' words for kinship, health, body parts and common animals. Numbers, especially, show remarkable similarities.

However, Indonesian as it is known today was heavily influenced by several languages due to historical ties with other nations. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] made the highest contribution to the language, especially in vocabulary due to the Dutch's [[Dutch East Indies|colonization]] for over three centuries, from the 16th century until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dannyreviews.com/h/Indonesian_Language.html|title=The Indonesian Language (James N Sneddon) – book review|website=dannyreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/?/en/collecties/nederlands-indie_in_fotos,_1860-1940|title=The Dutch East Indies in photographs, 1860–1940 – Memory of the Netherlands|website=www.geheugenvannederland.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Languages of Asia|Asian languages]] also influenced the language, with [[Chinese language|Chinese]] influencing Indonesian during the 15th and 16th centuries due to the [[spice trade]]; [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Prakrit language|Prakrit]] 
and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] contributing during the flourishing of [[History of Indonesia#Hindu-Buddhist civilizations|Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms]] from the 2nd to the 14th century; followed by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] after the [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|spread of Islam]] in the archipelago in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the history of Indonesian |first=H. |last=Steinhauer |journal=Studies in Slavic and General Linguistics |volume=1 |year=1980 |pages=349–375 |jstor=40996873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loanwords from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] were mainly connected with articles that the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia. Indonesian also receives many of [[English language|English]] words as results of [[globalization]] and [[modernization]], especially since the 1990s, as far as the [[History of Internet|Internet's emergence and development]] until now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/MED-Magazine/May2006/38-Indonesian-English-false-friends.htm|title=Language interference: Indonesian and English|website=www.macmillandictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Indonesian words have also been borrowed into English, among them the common words {{lang|id|orangutan}}, {{lang|id|gong}}, {{lang|id|bamboo}}, {{lang|id|rattan}}, {{lang|id|sarong}}, and the less common words such as {{lang|id|paddy}}, {{lang|id|sago}} and {{lang|id|kapok}}. The phrase "to run amok" comes from the Indonesian verb ''amuk'' (to run out of control, to rage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutworldlanguages.com/bahasa-indonesia|title=Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia) – About World Languages|website=aboutworldlanguages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipll.manoa.hawaii.edu/indonesian/about/bahasa-indonesia-the-indonesian-language/|title=History of Indonesian|website=ipll.manoa.hawaii.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the complexity of historical background of the language, Indonesian has become more advanced{{what|date=November 2018}}, even when compared to its own ancestor, Malay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/3731529|title=Language Policy in Indonesia and Malay Countries|first=Nazarudin |last=Nazarudin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indonesian is neither [[Pidgin language|pidgin]] or [[Creole language|creole]] since the feature characteristics do not meet any of the criteria for either. It is believed that the Indonesian language was one of the means to achieve independence, but it is opened to receive vocabulary from other foreign languages aside from Malay that it has made contact with since the colonialism era, such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]] and [[Arabic languages|Arabic]] among others, as the [[loan words]] keep increasing each year.&lt;ref&gt;Pratika, D.

== Geographical distribution ==
In 2010, Indonesian had 42.8&amp;nbsp;million [[native speaker]]s, and 154.9&amp;nbsp;million [[second language|second-language]] speakers,&lt;ref name="sensus2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bps.go.id/index.php/publikasi/14 |title=Penduduk Indonesia Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2010 (Result of Indonesia Population Census 2010) |pages=421, 427 |author=Badan Pusat Statistik |date=28 March 2013 |issn=2302-8513 |access-date=12 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402221528/http://www.bps.go.id/index.php/publikasi/14 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who speak it alongside their [[languages of Indonesia|local mother tongue]], giving a total number of speakers in Indonesia of 197.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="sensus2010"/&gt; It is common as a first language in urban areas, and as a second language by those residing in more rural parts of Indonesia.

In [[East Timor]], which was occupied by Indonesia between 1975 and 1999, Indonesian is recognised by the constitution as one of the two working languages (the other being [[English language|English]]), alongside the official languages of [[Tetum language|Tetum]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name="easttimorgovernment.com"/&gt; Its understood by among the Malay people of Australia's [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Keeling Islands]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], also in some parts of the [[Sulu|Sulu area]] of the southern [[Philippines]] and traces of it are to be found among people of Malay descent in [[Sri Lanka]], [[South Africa]], [[Suriname]], and other places.&lt;ref name="hawaii.edu"/&gt;

== Official status ==

[[File:Indonesian magazines Jakarta.JPG|thumb|Indonesian is also the language of Indonesian mass media, such as magazines. Printed and broadcast mass media are encouraged to use proper Indonesian, although more relaxed popular slang often prevails.]]
[[File:Jakarta Indonesia Merdeka-Square-04.jpg|thumb|Warning sign in Indonesia]]
Indonesian is the [[official language]] of the [[Republic of Indonesia]], thus its usage is encouraged throughout the Indonesian archipelago. It's regulated in Chapter XV, [[Constitution of Indonesia|Constitution of Indonesia 1945]] about the flag, official language, coat of arms, and national anthem of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia|Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Chapter III, Section 25 to 45, Government regulation No. 24/ 2009 specifically mentions the status of the Indonesian language.&lt;ref name="UU No 24/2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://badanbahasa.kemdiknas.go.id/lamanbahasa/sites/default/files/UU_2009_24.pdf |title=Undang-undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 24 Tahun 2009 2009 Tentang Bendera, Bahasa, dan Lambang Negara, serta Lagu Kebangsaan |publisher=Badan Pengembangan dan Pembinaan Bahasa, Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan |accessdate=1 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523194115/http://badanbahasa.kemdiknas.go.id/lamanbahasa/sites/default/files/UU_2009_24.pdf |archivedate=23 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The national language shall be Indonesian

Indonesian functions as a symbol of national identity and pride, and is a unifying language among the diverse [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesian ethnic groups]]. It also serves as a vehicle of communication among the Indonesian provinces and different regional cultures in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="UU No 24/2009"/&gt; The language is used as the national official language, the language of education, communication, transaction and trade documentation, the development of national culture, science, technology, and mass media in Indonesia.

According to Indonesian law, the Indonesian language was proclaimed as the unifying language during [[Sumpah Pemuda]] on 28 October 1928, developed further to accommodate the dynamics of Indonesian civilization.&lt;ref name="UU No 24/2009" /&gt; As mentioned previously, the language was based on Riau Malay,&lt;ref name="Indonesian Embassy: Astana" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnologue:Indonesian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ind |title=Indonesian, A language of Indonesia |publisher=[[Ethnologue]] |accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though linguists note that this is not the local dialect of Riau, but the Malaccan dialect that was used in the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate|Riau court]].&lt;ref name="Sneddon" /&gt; Since its conception in 1928 and its official recognition in 1945 Constitution, the Indonesian language has been loaded with a nationalist political agenda to unify Indonesia (former [[Dutch East Indies]]). This status has made the Indonesian language relatively open to accommodate influences from other Indonesian ethnic languages, most notably Javanese as the majority ethnic group in Indonesia, and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as the previous colonizer. Compared to the indigenous dialects of [[Malay language|Malay]] spoken in Sumatra and Malay peninsula or the normative Malaysian standard, the Indonesian language differs profoundly by a large amount of [[Javanese language|Javanese]] loanwords incorporated into its already rich vocabulary. As a result, Indonesian has wider sources of [[list of loan words in Indonesian|loanwords]], compared to Malaysian Malay. It is sometimes said that the Indonesian language is an artificial language made official in 1928. By artificial, it means that Indonesian was designed by academics rather than evolving naturally as most common languages have,&lt;ref name="Interesting Thing of the Day"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itotd.com/articles/310/bahasa-indonesia/ |title=Bahasa Indonesia, The complex story of a simple language |date=17 September 2004 |publisher=Interesting Thing of the Day |accessdate=1 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to accommodate the political purpose of establishing an official unifying language of Indonesia. By borrowing heavily from numerous other languages it expresses a natural linguistic evolution; in fact, it is as natural as the next language, as demonstrated in its exceptional capacity for absorbing foreign vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Interesting Thing of the Day" /&gt;

The disparate evolution of Indonesian and Malaysian has led to a rift between the two standardized registers. This has been based more upon political nuance and the history of their standardization rather than cultural reasons, and as a result there are asymmetrical views regarding each other's variety among Malaysians and Indonesians. In Malaysia, the national language is called either Malay or Malaysian; in Indonesia, it is Indonesian. Malaysians tend to assert that Malaysian and Indonesian are merely different normative varieties of the same language, while Indonesians tend to treat them as separate, albeit closely related, languages. The result of this attitude is that Indonesians feel little need to harmonize their language with Malaysia and Brunei, whereas Malaysians are keener to coordinate the evolution of the language with Indonesians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2005/yax-455.htm|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060400/http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2005/yax-455.htm|archive-date=4 March 2016|title=Who is Malay?|date=July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the 1972 [[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System|Indonesian alphabet reform]] was largely seen as a concession of Dutch-based Indonesian to the English-based spelling of Malaysian.

== Phonology ==
{{main|Malay phonology}}
=== Vowels ===
It is usually said that there are six vowels in Indonesian.&lt;ref name="SodOlson2008" /&gt; These six vowels are shown in the table below. However, other analyses set up a system with other vowels, particularly the open-mid vowels {{IPAslink|ɛ}} and {{IPAslink|ɔ}}.&lt;ref&gt;Yunus Maris, M. (1980). ''The Indonesian Sound System''. Kuala Lumpur: Penerbit Fajar Bakti Sdn. Bhd, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In standard Indonesian orthography, the [[Latin alphabet]] is used, and five vowels are distinguished: ''a, i, u, e, o''. In materials for learners, the mid-front vowel /e/ is sometimes represented with a diacritic as ''é'' to distinguish it from the mid-central vowel /ə/.

====Diphthongs====
Some analyses claim that Indonesian has three native [[diphthong]] phonemes only in open syllables, they are:
* {{IPA|/ai̯/}}: ''ked'''ai''''' ('shop'), ''pand'''ai''''' ('clever')
* {{IPA|/au̯/}}: ''kerb'''au''''' ('buffalo'), ''lim'''au''''' ('orange')
* {{IPA|/oi̯/}} (or {{IPA|/ʊi̯/}} in Indonesian): ''dod'''oi''''', ''amb'''oi'''''

Others assume that these diphthongs are actually a monophthong followed by an approximant, so {{angbr|ai}} represents {{IPA|/aj/}}, {{angbr|au}} represents {{IPA|/aw/}}, and {{angbr|oi}} represents {{IPA|/oj/}}. On this basis, there are no phonological diphthongs in Indonesian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clynes | first1 = A | year = 1997 | title = On the Proto-Austronesian 'diphthongs' | journal = Oceanic Linguistics | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 347–362 | doi=10.2307/3622989 |jstor=3622989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diphthongs are differentiated from two vowels in two syllables, such as:
* {{IPA|/a.i/}}: e.g. ''l'''ai'''n'' ('other') {{IPA|[la.in]}}, '''''ai'''r'' ('water')  {{IPA|[a.ir]}}
* {{IPA|/a.u/}}: ''b'''au''''' ('smell') {{IPA|[ba.u]}}, ''l'''au'''t'' ('sea') {{IPA|[la.ut]}}

Some analyses list 19 "primary consonants" for Indonesian as the 18 symbols that are not in parentheses in the table as well as the glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}}. The secondary consonants /f/, /v/, /z/, /ʃ/ and /x/ only appear in loanwords. Some speakers pronounce /v/ in loanwords as [v], otherwise it is [f]. [z] can also be an allophone of /s/ before voiced consonants..&lt;ref&gt;Asmah Haji Omar (2008). ''Ensiklopedia Bahasa Melayu''. Kuala Lumpur: Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yunus Maris, M. (1980). ''The Indonesian Sound System''. Kuala Lumpur: Penerbit Fajar Bakti Sdn. Bhd, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{IPAslink|j}} is written {{angbr|y}}

=== Stress ===
Indonesian has light [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] that falls on either the final or penultimate syllable, depending on regional variations as well as the presence of the schwa ({{IPA|/ə/}}) in a word. It is generally the penultimate syllable that is stressed, unless its vowel is a schwa {{IPA|/ə/}}. If the penult has a schwa, then stress moves to the ante-penultimate syllable if there is one, even if that syllable has a schwa as well; if the word is disyllabic, the stress is final. In disyllabic stress with a closed penultimate syllable, such as ''tinggal'' ('stay') and ''rantai'' ('chain'), stress falls on the penult.

However, there is some disagreement among linguists over whether stress is phonemic (unpredictable), with some analyses suggesting that there is no underlying stress in Indonesian.&lt;ref name="ClynesDet2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zur2008"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Zuraidah |last1=Mohd Don |last2=Knowles |first2=G. |last3=Yong |first3=J. |year=2008 |title=How words can be misleading: A study of syllable timing and 'stress' in Malay |journal=The Linguistics Journal |volume=3 |issue=2 |url=https://www.linguistics-journal.com/2014/01/08/how-words-can-be-misleading-a-study-of-syllable-timing-and-stress-in-malay/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/11/abstracts/Gil.pdf |accessdate=2012-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225063313/http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/11/abstracts/Gil.pdf |archivedate=25 February 2012 |df=dmy-all |last=Gil |first=David |title=A Typology of Stress, And Where Malay/Indonesian Fits In}} (abstract only)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rhythm ===
The classification of languages based on rhythm can be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Roach, P. (1982). "On the distinction between 'stress-timed' and 'syllable-timed' languages".  In D. Crystal (ed.), ''Linguistic Controversies'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;73–79). London: Edward Arnold.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, acoustic measurements suggest that Indonesian has more syllable-based rhythm than British English,&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D. (2011). "Measurements of the rhythm of Malay". In ''Proceedings of the 17th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, Hong Kong, 17–21 August 2011'', pp. 576–579. [http://www.ubd.edu.bn/academic/faculty/FASS/staff/docs/DD/ICPhS-HK-Malay-rhythm.pdf On-line Version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515020831/http://www.ubd.edu.bn/academic/faculty/FASS/staff/docs/DD/ICPhS-HK-Malay-rhythm.pdf |date=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though doubts remain about whether the syllable is the appropriate unit for the study of Malay prosody.&lt;ref name="Zur2008" /&gt; However, many linguists suggest that rhythm in Indonesian is not payed{{Clarify|date=October 2017}}, because Indonesian is not a kind of [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal language]] like [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].&lt;ref name="hawaii.edu"/&gt;

== Grammar ==
Word order in Indonesian is generally [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO), similar to that of most modern [[European languages]], such as English. However considerable flexibility in word ordering exists, in contrast with languages such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[Korean language|Korean]], for instance, which always end clauses with verbs. Indonesian, while allowing for relatively flexible word orderings, does not mark for [[grammatical case]] nor does it make use of [[grammatical gender]].

=== Affixes ===
In Indonesian, affixes take on an important role because slightly different affixes may have very different meanings. There are four types of affixes: [[prefixes]] (''awalan''), [[suffixes]] (''akhiran''), [[circumfixes]] (''apitan'') and [[infixes]] (''sisipan''). Affixes are categorized into noun, verb, and adjective affixes. Root words are either nouns or verbs, which can take on affixes to generate new words, for example, ''masak'' (to cook) may become ''memasak'' (cooks), ''memasakkan'' (cooks for), ''dimasak'' (cooked), ''pemasak'' (a cook), ''masakan'' (a meal, cookery), ‘’termasak’’ (accidentally cooked). Many initial consonants alternate in the presence of prefixes: ''sapu'' (to sweep) becomes ''menyapu'' (sweeps/sweeping); ''panggil'' (to call) becomes ''memanggil'' (calls/calling), ''tapis'' (to sieve) becomes ''menapis'' (sieves).

Other examples of the use of [[affix]]es to change the meaning of a word can be seen with the word ''ajar'' (teach):
* ''ajar'' = teach

==== Noun affixes ====
Noun affixes are affixes that form nouns upon addition to root words. The following are examples of noun affixes:

The prefix ''per-'' drops its ''r'' before ''r, l'' and frequently before ''p, t, k.'' In some words it is ''peng-''; though formally distinct, these are treated as variants of the same prefix in Indonesian grammar books.

==== Verb affixes ====
Similarly, verb affixes in Indonesian are attached to root words to form verbs. In Indonesian, there are:

==== Adjective affixes ====
Adjective affixes are attached to root words to form adjectives:

|''serabut'' (dishevelled)
|-
|Circumfix
|kə-...-an
|''barat'' (west)
|''kebaratan'' (westernized)
|}

In addition to these affixes, Indonesian also has a lot of borrowed affixes from other languages such as Sanskrit, Arabic and English. For example, ''maha-'', ''pasca-'', ''eka-'', ''bi-'', ''anti-'', ''pro-'' etc.

=== Nouns ===
Common derivational affixes for nouns are peng-/per-/juru- (actor, instrument, or someone characterized by the root), -an (collectivity, similarity, object, place, instrument), ke-...-an (abstractions and qualities, collectivities), per-/peng-...-an (abstraction, place, goal or result).

==== Gender ====
Indonesian does not make use of [[grammatical gender]], and there are only selected words that use natural [[gender]]. For instance, the same word is used for ''he/him'' and ''she/her'' ({{lang|id|dia}} or {{lang|id|ia}}) or for ''his'' and ''her'' ({{lang|id|dia}}, {{lang|id|ia}} or {{lang|id|-nya}}). No real distinction is made between "girlfriend" and "boyfriend", both {{lang|id|pacar}} (although more colloquial terms as {{lang|id|cewek}} girl/girlfriend and {{lang|id|cowok}} boy/boyfriend can also be found). A majority of Indonesian words that refer to people generally have a form that does not distinguish between the sexes. However, unlike English, distinction is made between older or younger.

There are some words that have gender, for instance {{lang|id|putri}} means "daughter", and {{lang|id|putra}} means "son" and also {{lang|id|pramugara}} means "male flight attendant" and {{lang|id|pramugari}} meaning "female flight attendant". Another example would be {{lang|id|olahragawan}}, which equates to "sportsman", and {{lang|id|olahragawati}}, meaning sportswoman. Often, words like these (or certain suffixes such as "-a" and "-i" or "-wan" and "wati") are absorbed from other languages (in these cases, from [[Sanskrit]] through the Old [[Javanese language]]).
In some regions of Indonesia such as Sumatra and Jakarta, {{lang|id|abang}} (a gender-specific term meaning "older brother") is commonly used as a form of address for older siblings/males, while {{lang|id|kakak}} (a non-gender specific term meaning "older sibling") is often used to mean "older sister". Similarly, more direct influences from other languages, such as Javanese and Chinese, have also seen further use of other gendered words in Indonesian. For example: {{lang|jv|Mas}} ("older brother"), {{lang|jv|M'bak}} ("older sister"), {{lang|jv|Koko}} ("older brother") and {{lang|jv|Cici}} ("older sister").

==== Number ====
Indonesian grammar does not regularly mark [[plural]]s. In Indonesian, to change a singular into a plural one either repeats the word or adds ''para'' before it (the latter for living things only); for example, "students" can be either {{lang|id|murid-murid}} or {{lang|id|para murid}}. Plurals are rarely used in Indonesian, especially in informal parlance. Reduplication is often mentioned as the formal way to express the plural form of nouns in Indonesian; however, in informal daily [[discourse]], speakers of Indonesian usually use other [[Methodology|methods]] to indicate the [[concept]] of something being "more than one". Reduplication may also indicate the conditions of variety and diversity as well, and not simply plurality.

[[Reduplication]] is commonly used to emphasize plurality; however, reduplication has many other functions. For example, ''orang-orang'' means "(all the) people", but ''orang-orangan'' means "scarecrow". Similarly, while ''hati'' means "heart" or "liver", ''hati-hati'' is a verb meaning "to be careful". Also, not all reduplicated words are inherently plural, such as ''orang-orangan'' "scarecrow/scarecrows", ''biri-biri'' "a/some sheep" and ''kupu-kupu'' "butterfly/butterflies". Some reduplication is rhyming rather than exact, as in ''sayur-mayur'' "(all sorts of) vegetables".

Distributive affixes derive mass nouns that are effectively plural: ''pohon'' "tree", ''pepohonan'' "[[flora]], trees"; ''rumah'' "house", ''perumahan'' "housing, houses"; ''gunung'' "mountain", ''pegunungan'' "mountain range, mountains".

Quantity words come before the noun: ''seribu orang'' "a thousand people", ''beberapa pegunungan'' "a series of mountain ranges", ''beberapa kupu-kupu'' "some butterflies".

Plural in Indonesian serves just to explicitly mention the number of objects in sentence. For example, ''Ani membeli satu kilo mangga'' (Ani buys one kilogram of mangoes). In this case, "mangoes", which is plural, is not said as ''mangga-mangga'' because the plurality is implicit: the [[amount]] '''a kilogram''' means more than one mango. So, as it is logically, one does not change the singular into the plural form, because it is not necessary and considered a [[pleonasm]] (in Indonesian often called ''pemborosan kata'').

=== Pronouns ===
Personal pronouns are not a separate part of speech, but a subset of nouns. They are frequently omitted, and there are numerous ways to say "you". Commonly the person's name, title, title with name, or occupation is used ("does Johnny want to go?", "would Madam like to go?"); kin terms, including [[fictive kinship]], are extremely common. However, there are also dedicated personal pronouns, as well as the demonstrative pronouns ''ini'' "this, the" and ''itu'' "that, the".

==== Personal pronouns ====
From the perspective of a European language, Indonesian boasts a wide range of different pronouns, especially to refer to the addressee (the so-called second person pronouns). These are used to differentiate several parameters of the person they are referred to, such as the social rank and the relationship between the addressee and the speaker.

This table shows an overview over the most commonly and widely used pronouns of the Indonesian language:

|}
* '''First person pronouns'''
Notable among the personal-pronoun system is a distinction between [[inclusive and exclusive we|two forms of "we"]]: ''kita'' (you and me, you and us) and ''kami'' (us, but not you). The distinction is increasingly confused in colloquial Indonesian.

''Saya'' and ''aku'' are the two major forms of "I". ''Saya'' is the more formal form, whereas ''aku'' is used with family, friends, and between lovers. ''Sahaya'' is an old or literary form of ''saya''. ''Sa(ha)ya'' may also be used for "we", but in such cases it is usually used with ''sekalian'' or ''semua'' "all"; this form is ambiguous as to whether it corresponds with inclusive ''kami'' or exclusive ''kita''. Less common are ''hamba'' "slave", ''hamba tuan, hamba datuk'' (all extremely humble), ''beta'' (a royal addressing oneselves), ''patik'' (a commoner addressing a royal), ''kami'' (royal or editorial "we"), ''kita'', ''təman'', and ''kawan.''
* '''Second person pronouns'''
There are three common forms of "you", ''Anda'' (polite), ''kamu'' (familiar), and ''kalian'' "all" (commonly used as a plural form of you, slightly informal). ''Anda'' is used with strangers, recent acquaintances, in advertisements, in business, and when you wish to show respect (though terms like ''tuan'' "sir" and other titles also show respect), while ''kamu'' is used in situations where the speaker would use ''aku'' for "I". ''Anda sekalian'' is polite plural.

''Engkau'' (''əngkau''), commonly shortened to ''kau'', and ''hang'' are used to social inferiors, ''awak'' to equals, and ''əncik'' (''cek'' before a name) is polite, traditionally used for people without title. The compounds ''makcik'' and ''pakcik'' are used with village elders one is well acquainted with or the guest of.
* '''Third person pronouns'''
The common word for "s/he" and "they" is ''ia'', which has the object and emphatic/focused form ''dia''. ''Bəliau'' "his/her Honour" is respectful. As with "you", names and kin terms are extremely common. ''Mereka'' "someone", ''mereka itu'', or ''orang itu'' "those people" are used for "they".
* '''Regional varieties'''
There are a large number of other words for "I" and "you", many regional, dialectical, or borrowed from local languages. ''Saudara'' "you" (male) and ''saudari'' (female) (plural ''saudara-saudara'' or ''saudari-saudari'') show utmost respect. ''Daku'' "I" and ''dikau'' "you" are poetic or romantic. Indonesian ''[[Indonesian slang language|gua]]'' "I" (from [[Hokkien]] {{zh|t=我|poj=góa}}) and ''[[Indonesian slang language|lu]]'' "you" ({{zh|t=汝|poj=lú}})  are slang and extremely informal.

The pronouns ''aku, kamu, engkau, ia, kami,'' and ''kita'' are indigenous to Indonesian.

==== Possessive pronouns ====
''Aku, kamu, engkau'', and ''ia'' have short possessive [[enclitic]] forms. All others retain their full forms like other nouns, as does emphatic ''dia'': ''meja saya, meja kita, meja anda, meja dia'' "my table, our table, your table, his/her table".

{|class="wikitable"

|-
|kamu
| -mu
|''mejamu'' (your table)
|-
|ia
| -nya
|''mejanya'' (his, her, their table)
|}

There are also [[proclitic]] forms of ''aku'', ''ku-'' and ''kau-''. These are used when there is no emphasis on the pronoun:

:'''''Ku'''-dengar raja itu menderita penyakit kulit. '''Aku''' mengetahui ilmu kedokteran. '''Aku-lah''' yang akan mengobati dia.''
:"It has come to my attention that the King has a skin disease. I am skilled in medicine. ''I'' will cure him."
Here ''ku-''verb is used for a general report, ''aku'' verb is used for a factual statement, and emphatic ''aku-lah meng-''verb (≈ "I am the one who...") for focus on the pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;M.B. Lewis, 1947, ''Teach Yourself Indonesian'', p. 178, ASIN: B0007JGNQO&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Demonstrative pronouns ====
There are two [[demonstrative pronoun]]s in Indonesian. ''Ini'' "this, these" is used for a noun which is generally near to the speaker. ''Itu'' "that, those" is used for a noun which is generally far from the speaker. Either may sometimes be equivalent to English "the". There is no difference between singular and plural. However, plural can be indicated through duplication of a noun followed by a ''ini'' or ''itu''. The word ''yang'' "which" is often placed before demonstrative pronouns to give emphasis and a sense of certainty, particularly when making references or enquiries about something/ someone, like English "this one" or "that one".

=== Verbs ===
Verbs are not [[inflected language|inflected]] for person or number, and they are not marked for tense; tense is instead denoted by time adverbs (such as "yesterday") or by other tense indicators, such as ''sudah'' "already" and ''belum'' "not yet". On the other hand, there is a complex system of verb affixes to render nuances of meaning and to denote [[voice (grammar)|voice]] or intentional and accidental [[grammatical mood|moods]]. Some of these affixes are ignored in colloquial speech.

Examples of these are the prefixes ''di-'' ([[Austronesian alignment|patient focus]], traditionally called 
"passive voice", with OVA word order in the third person, and OAV in the first or second persons), ''meng-'' ([[Austronesian alignment|agent focus]], traditionally called 
"active voice", with AVO word order), ''memper-'' and ''diper-'' ([[causative]], agent and patient focus), ''ber-'' ([[stative verb|stative]] or habitual; intransitive VS order), and ''ter-'' (agentless actions, such as those which are involuntary, sudden, stative or accidental, for VA = VO order); the suffixes ''-kan'' (causative or [[benefactive]]) and ''-i'' (locative, repetitive, or exhaustive); and the circumfixes ''ber-...-an'' ([[pluractionality|plural subject, diffuse action]]) and ''ke-...-an'' (unintentional or potential action or state).

* ''duduk'' to sit down
* ''mendudukkan'' to sit someone down, give someone a seat, to appoint
* ''menduduki'' to sit on, to occupy
* ''didudukkan'' to be given a seat, to be appointed
* ''diduduki'' to be sat on, to be occupied
* ''terduduk'' to sink down, to come to sit
* ''kedudukan'' to be situated

Forms in ''ter-'' and ''ke-...-an'' are often equivalent to adjectives in English.

==== Negation ====
Four words are used for negation in Indonesian, namely ''tidak'', ''bukan'', ''jangan'', and ''belum''.

* '''''Tidak''''' (not), often shortened to '''''tak''''', is used for the negation of verbs and "adjectives".
* '''''Bukan''''' (be-not) is used in the negation of a noun.
For example:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Indonesian
!Gloss
!English
|-
|''Saya '''tidak''' tahu'' (Saya '''tak''' tahu)
|I '''not''' know
|I do '''not''' know
|-
|''Ibu saya '''tidak''' senang'' (Ibu saya '''tak''' senang)
|mother I '''not''' be-happy
|My mother is '''not''' happy
|-
|''Itu '''bukan''' anjing saya''
|that '''be-not''' dog I
|That '''is not''' my dog
|}

==== Prohibition ====
For negating imperatives or advising against certain actions in Indonesian, the word ''jangan'' (do not) is used before the verb. For example,
*  '''''Jangan''''' tinggalkan saya di sini!
:'''Don't''' leave me here!
*  '''''Jangan''''' lakukan itu!
:'''Don't''' do that!
*  '''''Jangan'''''! Itu tidak bagus untukmu.
:'''Don't!''' That's not good for you.

=== Adjectives ===
There are grammatical adjectives in Indonesian. [[Stative verb]]s are often used for this purpose as well. Adjectives are always placed after the noun that they modify. Hence, "rumah saya" means "my house", while "saya rumah" means "I am a house". 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Indonesian
!Gloss
!English
|-
|''Hutan hijau''
|forest green
|(The) green forest.
|-
|''Hutan itu hijau''
|forest that green
|That/the forest is green.
|-
|''Kəreta yang merah''
|carriage which (is) red.
|(The) carriage which is red = the red carriage.
|-
|''Kəreta merah''
|carriage red.
|Red carriage.
|-
|''Dia orang yang terkenal sekali''
|he/she person which be-famous very
|He/she is a very famous person
|-
|''Orang terkenal''
|person famous.
|Famous person.
|-
|''Orang ini terkenal sekali''
|person this be-famous very
|This person is very famous
|}

To say that something "is" an adjective, the determiners "itu" and "ini" ("that" and "this") are often used. For example, in the sentence "anjing itu galak", the use of "itu" gives a meaning of "the/that dog is ferocious", while "anjing ini galak", gives a meaning of "this dog is ferocious". However, if "itu" or "ini" were not to be used, then "anjing galak" would meaning only "ferocious dog", a plain adjective without any stative implications. The all-purpose determiner, "yang", is also often used before adjectives, hence "anjing yang galak" also means "ferocious dog" or more literally "dog which is ferocious"; "yang" will often be used for clarity. Hence, in a sentence such as "saya didekati oleh anjing galak" which means "I was approached by a ferocious dog", the use of the adjective "galak" is not stative at all.

Often the "ber-" intransitive verb prefix, or the "ter-" stative prefix is used to express the meaning of "to be...". For example, "beda" means "different", hence "berbeda" means "to be different"; "awan" means "cloud", hence "berawan" means "cloudy". Using the "ter-" prefix, implies a state of being. For example, "buka" means "open", hence "terbuka" means "is opened"; "tutup" means "closed/shut", hence "tertutup" means "is closed/shut".

=== Word order ===
Adjectives, [[demonstrative]] determiners, and [[possessive]] determiners follow the noun they modify.

Indonesian does not have a [[grammatical subject]] in the sense that English does. In intransitive clauses, the noun comes before the verb. When there is both an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] and an [[object (grammar)|object]], these are separated by the verb (OVA or AVO), with the difference encoded in the voice of the verb. OVA, commonly but inaccurately called "passive", is the basic and most common word order.

Either the agent or object or both may be omitted. This is commonly done to accomplish one of two things:

;1) Adding a sense of politeness and respect to a statement or question

For example, a polite shop assistant in a store may avoid the use of pronouns altogether and ask:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Ellipses of pronoun (agent &amp; object)
! Literal English
! Idiomatic English
|-
| Bisa ''dibantu?''
| Can + ''to be helped''?
| Can (I) ''help'' (you)?
|}

;2) Agent or object is unknown, not important, or understood from context

For example, a friend may enquire as to when you bought your property, to which you may respond:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Ellipses of pronoun (understood agent)
! Literal English
! Idiomatic English
|-
| ''Rumah ini '''dibeli''' lima tahun yang lalu''
| House this + ''be purchased'' five year(s) ago
| The house 'was purchased' five years ago
|}

Ultimately, the choice of voice and therefore word order is a choice between actor and patient and depends quite heavily on the language style and context.

==== Emphasis ====
Word order is frequently modified for [[focus (grammar)|focus]] or emphasis, with the focused word usually placed at the beginning of the clause and followed by a slight pause (a break in [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]):

* ''Saya pergi ke pasar kemarin'' "I went to the market yesterday" – neutral, or with focus on the subject.
* ''Kemarin saya pergi ke pasar'' "Yesterday I went to the market" – emphasis on yesterday.
* ''Ke pasar saya pergi, kemarin'' "To the market I went yesterday" – emphasis on where I went yesterday.
* ''Pergi ke pasar, saya, kemarin'' "To the market went I yesterday" – emphasis on the process of going to the market.

The last two are more likely to be encountered in speech than in writing.

=== Measure words ===
Another distinguishing feature of Indonesian is its use of [[measure word]]s, also called [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] (''kata penggolong''). In this way, it is similar to many other languages of Asia, including [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Bengali language|Bengali]].

Measure words are also found in English such as ''two head of cattle'', ''a loaf of bread'', or ''this sheet of paper'', where ''*two cattle, a bread,'' and ''this paper'' (in the sense of ''this piece of paper'') would be ungrammatical. The word ''satu'' reduces to ''se-'' {{IPA|/sə/}}, as it does in other compounds:

''Example'':
Measure words are not necessary just to say "a": ''burung'' "a bird, birds". Using ''se-'' plus a measure word is closer to English "one" or "a certain":
:''Ada seekor burung yang bisa berbicara''
:"There was a (certain) bird that could talk"

== Writing system ==
{{main article|Indonesian alphabet|Perfected Spelling System}}

Indonesian is written with the [[Latin script]]. It was originally based on the [[Dutch spelling]] and still bears some similarities to it. Consonants are represented in a way similar to [[Italian language#Writing system|Italian]], although {{angle bracket|c}} is always {{IPA|/tʃ/}} (like English {{angle bracket|ch}}), {{angle bracket|g}} is always {{IPA|/ɡ/}} ("hard") and {{angle bracket|j}} represents {{IPA|/dʒ/}} as it does in English. In addition, {{angle bracket|ny}} represents the [[palatal nasal]] {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, {{angle bracket|ng}} is used for the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|/ŋ/}} (which can occur word-initially), {{angle bracket|sy}} for {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (English {{angle bracket|sh}}) and {{angle bracket|kh}} for the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}}. Both {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}} are represented with {{angle bracket|e}}.

Spelling changes in the language that have occurred since Indonesian independence include:

Introduced in 1901, the [[van Ophuijsen Spelling System|''van Ophuijsen'' system]], (named from the advisor of the system, Charles Adriaan van Ophuijsen) was the first standardization of romanized spelling. It was most influenced by the then current [[Dutch orthography|Dutch spelling system]]. In 1947, the spelling was changed into ''[[Republican Spelling System|Republican Spelling]]'' or ''Soewandi Spelling'' (named by at the time Minister of Education, Soewandi). This spelling changed formerly spelled ''oe'' into ''u'' (however, the spelling influenced other aspects in orthography, for example writing reduplicated words). All of the other changes were a part of the [[Perfected Spelling System]], an officially mandated [[spelling reform]] in 1972. Some of the old spellings (which were derived from [[Dutch orthography]]) do survive in proper names; for example, the name of a former president of Indonesia is still sometimes written ''[[Suharto|Soeharto]]'', and the central Java city of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]] is sometimes written ''Jogjakarta''.

=== Letter names and pronunciations ===
The [[Malay alphabet|Indonesian alphabet]] is exactly the same as in English and ISO basic Latin alphabet.

Indonesian follows the letter names of the [[Dutch alphabet]]. Indonesian alphabet has a [[phonemic orthography]]; words are spelled the way they are pronounced, with few exceptions. The letters Q, V and X are rarely encountered, being chiefly used for writing [[loanword]]s.

As a modern variety of Malay, Indonesian has been influenced by other languages, including [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], and [[Persian language|Persian]]. It is estimated that there are some 750 Sanskrit loanwords in modern Indonesian, 1,000 Arabic loans, some of [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] origin, some 125 words of Portuguese, some of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] origin, and 10,000 loanwords from Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;This is research led by Prof. Dr. J. W. de Vries of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2018}} The vast majority of Indonesian words, however, come from the root lexical stock of Austronesian (including Old Malay).&lt;ref name="Paauw"/&gt;

The study of Indonesian etymology and loan words reveals both its historical and social contexts. Examples are the early Sanskrit borrowings from the 7th century during the trading era, the borrowings from Arabic and Persian during the time of the establishment of Islam in particular, and those from Dutch during the colonial period. Linguistic history and cultural history are clearly linked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aseasuk.org.uk/v2/aseasuknews/%252Fbookreviews/46/Grijns%20et%20al. |title=Loan-words in Indonesian and Malay |editor=C.

The [[Sanskrit]] influence came from contacts with [[India]] since ancient times. The words were either borrowed directly from India or with the intermediary of the [[Old Javanese language]]. Although [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] are no longer the major religions of Indonesia, [[Sanskrit]], which was the language vehicle for these religions, is still held in high esteem and is comparable with the status of [[Latin]] in [[English language|English]] and other Western European languages. Sanskrit is also the main source for [[neologism]]s, these are usually formed from Sanskrit roots. The loanwords from Sanskrit cover many aspects of [[religion]], [[art]] and everyday life.

From [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] came such words as स्वर्ग ''surga'' (heaven), भाषा ''bahasa'' (language), काच ''kaca'' (glass, mirror), राज- ''raja'' (king), मनुष्य ''manusia'' (mankind), चिन्ता ''cinta'' (love), भूमि ''bumi'' (earth), भुवन ''buana'' (world), आगम ''agama'' (religion), स्त्री ''Istri'' (wife/woman), जय ''Jaya'' (victory/victorious), पुर ''Pura'' (city/temple/place), रक्षस ''[[Raksasa]]'' (giant/monster), धर्म ''[[Dharma]]'' (rule/regulations), मन्त्र ''[[Mantra]]'' (words/poet/spiritual prayers), क्षत्रिय ''Satria'' (warrior/brave/soldier), विजय ''Wijaya'' (greatly victorious/great victory), etc. [[Sanskrit]] words and sentences are also used in names, titles, and mottos of the Indonesian National Police and Indonesian Armed Forces such as: ''[[Indonesian National Police|Bhayangkara]]'', ''[[Laksamana]]'', ''[[Jatayu]]'', ''[[Garuda]]'', ''Dharmakerta Marga Reksyaka'', ''[[Indonesian Navy|Jalesveva Jayamahe]]'', ''[[Indonesian Army|Kartika Eka Paksi]]'', ''[[Indonesian Air Force|Swa Bhuwana Paksa]]'', ''[[Indonesian National Police|Rastra Sewakottama]]'', ''Yudha Siaga'', etc.

Because [[Sanskrit]] has long been known in the [[Indonesian archipelago]], Sanskrit loanwords, unlike those from other languages, have entered the basic vocabulary of Indonesian to such an extent that, for many, they are no longer perceived to be foreign. Therefore, one could write a short story using only Sanskrit words. The short story below consists of approximately 80 words in Indonesian that are written using Sanskrit words alone, except for a few particles.

=== Loan words of Chinese origin ===
{{see also|List of Chinese loanwords in Indonesian}}
The relationship with China has been going since the 7th century when Chinese merchants traded in some areas of the archipelago such as [[Riau]], [[West Borneo]], [[East Kalimantan]], and [[North Maluku]]. At the kingdom of Srivijaya appeared and flourished, China opened diplomatic relations with the kingdom in order to secure trade and seafaring. In 922, Chinese travelers visited [[Kahuripan]] in [[East Java]]. Since the 11th century, hundreds of thousands of Chinese migrants left [[Mainland China]] and settled in many parts of Nusantara (now called as Indonesia).

The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] loanwords are usually concerned with cuisine, trade or often just things exclusively Chinese. Words of Chinese origin (presented here with accompanying [[Hokkien]]/ Mandarin pronunciation derivatives as well as [[Traditional characters|traditional]] and [[simplified characters]]) include ''pisau'' (匕首 bǐshǒu &amp;nbsp;– knife), ''loteng'', (樓/層 = lóu/céng&amp;nbsp;– [upper] floor/ level), ''mie'' (麵 &gt; 面 Hokkien mī&amp;nbsp;– noodles), ''[[lumpia]]'' (潤餅 (Hokkien = lūn-piáⁿ)&amp;nbsp;– springroll), ''cawan'' (茶碗 cháwǎn&amp;nbsp;– teacup), ''teko'' (茶壺 &gt; 茶壶 = cháhú [Mandarin], teh-ko [Hokkien] = teapot), 苦力 kuli = 苦 khu (hard) and 力 li (energy) and even the widely used slang terms ''gua'' and ''lu'' (from the Hokkien 'goa' 我 and 'lu/li' 汝&amp;nbsp;– meaning 'I/ me' and 'you').

=== Loan words of Arabic origin ===
[[File:Jakarta Indonesia Istiqlal-Mosque-03.jpg|thumb|The word ''masjid'' (mosque) in Indonesian derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|masjid}}'' ({{lang|ar|مسجد|rtl=yes}}).]]
Many Arabic words were brought and spread by merchants from [[Arab Peninsula]] like [[Arabian people|Arabian]], [[Persian people|Persian]], and from the western part of India, [[Gujarat]] where many Muslims lived.&lt;ref name="catdir.loc.gov"&gt;http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/98020577.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many Indonesian words come from the Arabic language. Especially since the late 12th century, Old Malay was heavily influenced by the language and produced many great literary works such as [[Syair]], [[Babad]], [[Hikayat]], and Suluk. This century is known as ''The Golden Age of Indonesian Literature''.&lt;ref name="catdir.loc.gov"/&gt;

Many loanwords from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are mainly concerned with religion, in particular with [[Islam]], and by extension, with greetings such as the word, "selamat" (from {{lang-ar|سلامة}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|salāma}}'' = health, soundness)&lt;ref&gt;[http://asalkata.com/?q=selamat Etymology of "selamat" in ''Asalkata.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; means "safe" or "lucky". Words of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin include ''dunia'' (from {{lang-ar|دنيا}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|dunyā}}'' = the present world), names of days (except ''Minggu''), such as ''Sabtu'' (from {{lang-ar|سبت}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sabt-u}}'' = Saturday), ''iklan'' ({{lang|ar|آعلان|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|iʻlan}}'' = advertisement), ''kabar'' ({{lang|ar|خبر|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|khabar}}'' = news), ''Kursi'' ({{lang|ar|كرسي|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kursī}}'' = a chair), ''jumat'' ({{lang|ar|جمعة|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|jumʻa}}'' = Friday), ''ijazah'' ({{lang|ar|إجازة|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|ijāza}}'' = 'permission', certificate of authority, e.g. a school diploma certificate), ''kitab'' ({{lang|ar|كتاب|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|kitāb}}'' = book), ''tertib'' ({{lang|ar|ترتيب|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|tartīb}}'' = order/arrangement) and ''kamus'' ({{lang|ar|قاموس|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|qāmūs}}'' = dictionary). [[Allah]] ({{lang-ar|الله}}), as it is mostly the case for [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic]] speakers, is the word for [[God]] even in [[Christian]] [[Bible]] translations. Many early Bible translators, when they came across some unusual [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words or proper names, used the Arabic cognates. In the newer translations this practice is discontinued. They now turn to [[Greek language|Greek]] names or use the original Hebrew Word. For example, the name [[Jesus]] was initially translated as ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Isa'' ({{lang-ar|عيسى}}), but is now spelt as ''Yesus''. Several ecclesiastical terms derived from Arabic still exist in Indonesian language. Indonesian word for ''[[bishop]]'' is ''uskup'' (from {{lang-ar|أسقف}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|usquf}}'' = bishop). This in turn makes the Indonesian term for [[archbishop]] ''uskup agung'' (literally ''great bishop''), which is combining the Arabic word with an Old Javanese word. The term ''imam'' (from {{lang-ar|إمام}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|imām}}'' = leader, prayer leader) is used to translate a Catholic [[priest]], beside its more common association with an Islamic prayer leader. Some Protestant denominations refer to their congregation ''jemaat'' (from {{lang-ar|جماعة}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|jamāʻa}}'' = group, a community). Even the name of the [[Bible]] in Indonesian translation is ''Alkitab'' (from {{lang-ar|الكتاب}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|al-kitāb}}'' = the book), which literally means "the Book".

=== Loan words of Portuguese origin ===
[[File:Front gate Ganjuran.jpg|thumb|Indonesian word "''[[wikt:gereja|Gereja]]''" (Church) is derived from Portuguese "''[[wikt:igreja|Igreja]]''". The sign reads: [[Ganjuran Church|"''Gereja &amp; Candi Hati Kudus Tuhan Yesus Ganjuran Keuskupan Agung Semarang''"]] (The Church and [[Temple]] of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] Ganjuran [[Archdiocese of Semarang]]).]]
Alongside [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' for trade throughout the archipelago from the sixteenth century through to the early nineteenth century. The Portuguese were among the first westerners to sail eastwards to the "[[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]". Loanwords from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] were mainly connected with articles that the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia. Indonesian words derived from Portuguese include ''meja'' (from mesa = table), ''bangku'' (from banco = bench), ''lemari/almari'' (from armário = closet), ''boneka'' (from boneca = doll), ''jendela'' (from janela = window), ''Gereja'' (from Igreja = Church), ''Misa'' (from Missa = Mass), ''Natal'' (from Natal = Christmas), ''Paskah'' (from Páscoa = Easter), ''pesta'' (from festa = party), ''dansa'' (from dança = dance), ''pesiar'' (from passear = cruise), ''bendera'' (from bandeira = flag), ''sepatu'' (from sapato = shoes), ''garpu'' (from garfo = fork), ''kemeja'' (from camisa = shirt), ''kereta'' (from carreta = chariot), ''pompa'' (from bomba hidráulica = pump), ''pigura'' (from figura = picture), ''roda'' (from roda = wheel), ''nona'' (from dona = young woman), ''sekolah'' (from escola = school), ''lentera'' (from lanterna = lantern), ''paderi'' (from padre = priest), ''Santo, Santa'' (from Santo, Santa = Saint), ''puisi'' (from poesia = poetry), ''keju'' (from queijo = cheese), ''mentega'' (from manteiga = butter), ''serdadu'' (from soldado = soldier), ''meski'' (from mas que = although), ''kamar'' (from câmara = room), ''laguna'' (from laguna = lagoon), ''lelang'' (from leilão = auction), ''persero'' (from parceiro = company), ''markisa'' (from maracujá = passion fruit), ''limau'' (from limão = lemon), ''kartu'' (from cartão = card), ''Inggris'' (from inglês = English), ''Sabtu'' (from sábado = Saturday), ''Minggu'' (from domingo = Sunday), etc.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp24"&gt;{{Cite book | last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300 |edition=2nd | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | pages =26  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-333-57689-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loan words of Dutch origin ===

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Glodok wijk te Djakarta TMnr 10014951.jpg|thumb|alt=Crowd at a busy street intersection. There are horse-drawn carriages in the foreground while a three-story building (with the sign "Kam Leng") and a single-story building (with the sign "Chunghua Bioscoop") stand in the background on adjacent corners of the intersection.|Chunghua ''bioscoop'' (now ''bioskop'' = cinema), [[Glodok]], [[Jakarta]] in 1953.]]

The former colonial power, the [[Netherlands]], left a sizable amount of vocabulary that can be seen in words such as ''polisi'' (from politie = police), ''kualitas'' (from kwaliteit = quality), ''aktual'' (from actueel = current), ''rokok'' (from roken = smoking cigarettes), ''korupsi'' (from corruptie = corruption), ''kantor'' (from kantoor = office), ''resleting'' (from ritssluiting = zipper), ''pelopor'' (from voorloper = frontrunner), ''persneling'' (from versnelling = transmission gear), ''setrum'' (from stroom = electricity current), ''maskapai'' (from maatschappij = company), ''apotek'' (from apotheek = pharmacy), ''handuk'' (from handdoek = towel), ''setrika'' (from strijkijzer = clothes iron), ''bioskop'' (from bioscoop = cinema), ''spanduk'' (from spandoeken = banner), ''korsleting'' (from kortsluiting = short circuit), ''om'' (from oom = uncle), ''tante'' (from tante = aunt), ''traktir'' (from trakteer = treat) and ''gratis'' (from gratis = free). These [[Dutch language|Dutch]] loanwords, and many other non-Italo-Iberian, European language loanwords that came via Dutch, cover all aspects of life. Some Dutch loanwords, having clusters of several consonants, pose difficulties to speakers of Indonesian. This problem is usually solved by insertion of the [[schwa]]. For example, Dutch ''schroef'' {{IPA|[ˈsxruf]}} &gt; ''sekrup'' {{IPA|[səˈkrup]}} (screw (n.)). One scholar argues that 20% of Indonesian words are inspired by the [[Dutch language]].&lt;ref name="mai"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/ies/050208/|title= A Hidden Language – Dutch in Indonesia|author= Hendrik M. Maier|date=8 Feb 2005|journal=Institute of European Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the standardization of the language, many Indonesian words follow standard Dutch alphabet and pronunciation such as "oe" for vowel "u" or "dj" for consonant "j" [dʒ]. As a result, Malay words are written with that orthography such as: {{lang|ms|passer}} for the word {{lang|id|Pasar}} or {{lang|ms|djalan}} for the word {{lang|id|jalan}}, older Indonesian generation tend to have their name written in such order as well.

=== Loan words of English origin ===
Many English words were incorporated into Indonesian through [[globalization]]. Many Indonesians, however, mistake words already adopted from Dutch as words borrowed from English. This is due to the Germanic traces that exist in the two languages. Indonesian adopts English words with standardization. For example: {{lang|id|ima'''j'''ina'''si'''}} from {{lang|en|ima'''g'''ina'''tion'''}}, {{lang|id|universi'''tas'''}} from {{lang|en|universi'''ty'''}}, {{lang|id|a'''ks'''esor'''i'''}} from {{lang|en|a'''cc'''essor'''y'''}}, {{lang|id|geogra'''fi'''}} from {{lang|en|geogra'''phy'''}}, {{lang|id|'''k'''onserva'''tif'''}} from {{lang|en|'''c'''onserva'''tive'''}}, {{lang|id|r'''u'''ti'''n'''}} from {{lang|en|r'''ou'''ti'''ne'''}}, and so other.&lt;ref name="lib.ui.ac.id"&gt;http://lib.ui.ac.id/file?file=digital/20316254-S42391-Kata%20serapan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several words that directly borrowed without standardization that have same meanings in English such as: ''bus'', ''data'', ''domain'', ''detail'', ''internet'', ''film'', ''golf'', ''lift'', ''monitor'', ''radio'', ''radar'', ''unit'', ''safari'', ''sonar'', and ''video'', ''riil as real''.&lt;ref name="lib.ui.ac.id"/&gt;

=== Other loan words ===
Modern Indonesian draws many of its words from foreign sources, there are many [[synonym]]s. For example, Indonesian has three words for "book", i.e. {{lang|id|pustaka}} (from Sanskrit), {{lang|id|kitab}} (from Arabic) and {{lang|id|buku}} (from Dutch {{lang|nl|boek}}); however, each has a slightly different meaning. A {{lang|id|pustaka}} is often connected with ancient wisdom or sometimes with esoteric knowledge. A derived form, {{lang|id|perpustakaan}} means a library. A {{lang|id|kitab}} is usually a religious scripture or a book containing moral guidance. The Indonesian words for the [[Bible]] and [[Gospel]] are {{lang|id|Alkitab}} and {{lang|id|Injil}}, both directly derived from Arabic. The book containing the penal code is also called the {{lang|id|kitab}}. {{lang|id|Buku}} is the most common word for books.

There are direct borrowings from various other languages of the world, such as ''karaoke'' (from {{lang|ja|カラオケ}}) from [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and ''ebi'' (from {{lang|ja|えび}}) which means dried shrimp. Many words that originally are adopted through the Dutch language today however often are mistaken as English due to the similarity in the Germanic nature of both languages. In some cases the words are replaced by English language through globalization: although the word {{lang|id|arbei}} (Dutch: {{lang|nl|aardbei}}) still literally means strawberry in Indonesian, today the usage of the word {{lang|id|stroberi}} is more common. [[Greek language|Greek]] words such as ''demokrasi'' (from δημοκρατία ''dēmokratía''), ''filosofi'' (from φιλοσοφία ''philasophia''), ''mitos'' (from μῦθος ''mythos'') came through Dutch, Arabic and Portuguese respectively.

It is notable that some of the loanwords that exist in both Indonesian and Malaysian languages are different in spelling and pronunciation mainly due to how they derived their origins: Malaysian utilizes words that reflect the [[English language|English]] usage (as used by its former colonial power, the [[United Kingdom|British]]), while Indonesian uses a [[Latin]]ate form reflected in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] usage (e.g. ''aktiviti'' (Malaysian) vs. ''aktivitas'' (Indonesian), ''universiti'' (Malaysian) vs. ''universitas'' (Indonesian)).

== Literature ==
{{Main article|Indonesian literature}}

Indonesia hosts a sparkling variety of traditional verbal arts such as [[poetry]], [[Narrative history|historical narratives]], [[romance film|romances]], and [[drama]]; which are expressed in local languages, but modern genres are expressed mainly through Indonesian.&lt;ref name="hawaii.edu"/&gt; Some of Indonesian great classic stories including [[Sitti Nurbaya]] by [[Marah Rusli]], [[Azab dan Sengsara]] by [[Merari Siregar]], and [[Sengsara Membawa Nikmat]] by [[Tulis Sutan Sati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resourcefulindonesian.com/indonesian-literature.html|title=Indonesian Literature|website=Resourceful Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accu.or.jp/appreb/09/pdf32-1/32-1p.03-4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Modern literature like [[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], stage plays, and [[Free verse|free-form poetry]] has developed since the late years of the 19th century and has produced such internationally recognised figures as [[novelist]] [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]], [[dramatist]] [[Willibrordus S. Rendra|W.S. Rendra]], poet [[Chairil Anwar]], and [[cinematographer]] [[Garin Nugroho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03062848208729531 | volume=10 | issue=29 | title=A new introduction to modern Indonesian literature | journal=Indonesia Circle.

One of the great is ''Shackles'' which was written by [[Armijn Pane]] in 1940. Originally titled ''[[Belenggu]]'' and translated into many languages including [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2016/08/20/must-read-indonesian-classic-novels.html|title=Must-read Indonesian classic novels|work=The Jakarta Post|first=Masajeng|last=Rahmiasri|date=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As speakers of other languages ==
[[File:BIPA photograph.jpg|thumb|upright=0.81|''BIPA ({{lang|id|Bahasa Indonesia bagi Penutur Asing}})'' book, which helps foreigners to learn Indonesian language effectively.]]

Over the past few years, interest in learning Indonesian has grown among non-Indonesians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Department Pendidikan Nasiona |title=Lentera Indonesia 1 |year=2006 |publisher=Department Pendidikan Nasiona |location=Jakarta |isbn=978-979-685-403-5 |page=v }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various universities have started to offer courses that emphasise the teaching of the language to non-Indonesians. In addition to National Universities, private institutions have also started to offer courses, like the Indonesia Australia Language Foundation and the {{lang|id|Lembaga Indonesia Amerika}}.
As early as 1988, teachers of the language have expressed the importance of a standardised {{lang|id|Bahasa Indonesia bagi Penutur Asing}} (also called '''BIPA''', literally ''Indonesian Language for Foreign Speaker'') materials (mostly books), and this need became more evident during the 4th International Congress on the Teaching of Indonesian to Speakers of Other Languages held in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ialf.edu/bipa/march2002/conferencereport.html|title=Conference Report: The Fourth International Conference on Teaching Indonesian to Speakers of Other Languages|website=www.ialf.edu|access-date=26 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402023735/http://ialf.edu/bipa/march2002/conferencereport.html|archive-date=2 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, the Indonesian Embassy in the Philippines has given basic Indonesian language courses to 16 batches of Filipino students, as well as training to members of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]]. Due to increasing demand among students, the Embassy will open an intermediate Indonesian language course later in the year.
In an interview, [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] Secretary [[Armin Luistro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rainier Alain |first=Ronda |title=Bahasa in schools? DepEd eyes 2nd foreign language |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/03/22/922576/bahasa-schools-deped-eyes-2nd-foreign-language |accessdate=11 June 2013 |newspaper=The Philippine Star |date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that the country's government should promote Indonesian or Malay, which are related to Filipino. Thus, the possibility of offering it as an optional subject in public schools is being studied.

The Indonesian Embassy in Washington, D.C., USA also began offering free Indonesian language courses at the beginner and intermediate level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.embassyofindonesia.org/index.php/2016/07/18/indonesian-language-classes/ |title=Indonesian Language Classes |accessdate=2018-10-30 |deadurl=no |website=Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia, Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Brazil}}
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official language of [[Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;According to the Brazilian Constitution: "Art. 13. A língua portuguesa é o idioma oficial da República Federativa do Brasil."[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/ConstituicaoCompilado.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely spoken by most of population. [[Brazilian Sign Language]] is also an official language. Minority [[languages]] include indigenous languages and languages of more recent European and Asian immigrants. The population speaks or signs approximately 210 [[languages]], of which 180 are indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=country Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; Less than forty thousand people actually speak any one of the [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] in the Brazilian territory.&lt;ref name="indbr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cienciaecultura.bvs.br/scielo.php?pid=S0009-67252005000200018&amp;script=sci_arttext | title=Sobre as línguas indígenas e sua pesquisa no Brasil|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2012-08-12|publisher=Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ciência|author=Aryon Dall'Igna Rodrigues|date=April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language]] is one of the strongest elements of Brazil's national [[wikt:unity|unity]]. As time progresses, fewer people speak dialects drastically different from Portuguese to make it easier for people to communicate with one another from one location to the next. Plenty Brazilians do speak their dialect. On top of that, within Portuguese between states there's a moderate regional variation in accent, vocabulary, and use of personal nouns, pronouns, and verb conjugations. Variations are beginning to diminish as a result of mass media, especially national television networks that are viewed by the majority of [[Brazilians]].

The [[written language]] is [[uniform]] across Brazil, and follows national rules of spelling and accentuation that are revised from time to time for simplification. With the implementation of the Orthographic Agreement of 1990, the orthographic norms of Brazil and Portugal were made virtually identical, with some minor differences. Brazil enacted these changes in 2009, and Portugal enacted them in 2012.

Written [[Brazilian Portuguese]] differs significantly from the [[spoken language]], with only an educated subsection of the population adhering to [[prestige dialect|prescriptive norms]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The rules of grammar are complex and allow more flexibility than English or Spanish. Many foreigners who speak Portuguese fluently have difficulty writing it properly. Because of Brazil's size, self-sufficiency, and relative isolation, foreign languages are not widely spoken. English is often studied in school and is increasingly studied in private [[Course (education)|courses]]. It has replaced French as the principal second language among educated people.

In 2002, Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) was made the official language of the Bennidorm deaf community.

Before the first Portuguese arrived in 1500, what is now Brazil was inhabited by several Amerindian people, who spoke different languages. According to Aryon Dall'Igna Rodrigues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A última falante viva de xipaia|url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EDR75091-6014,00.html|website=Revista Época|publisher=Editora Globo|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were six million Indians in Brazil speaking 1,000 different languages. When the Portuguese settlers arrived, they encountered the [[Tupi people]], who dominated most of the Brazilian coast and spoke a set of closely related languages. The Tupi called the non-Tupi peoples "Tapuias", a designation that the Portuguese adopted; however, there was little unity among the diverse Tapuia tribes other than their not being Tupi. In the first two centuries of colonization, a language based on [[Tupian languages]] (known as [[Língua geral]]) was widely spoken in the colony,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} not only by the Amerindians, but also by the Portuguese settlers, Africans and their descendants. This language was spoken in a vast area from [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] to [[Maranhão]], as an informal language for domestic use, while Portuguese was the language used for public purposes. Língua Geral was spread by the [[Jesuit]] [[missionary|missionaries]] and [[Bandeirante]]s to other areas of Brazil where the Tupi language was not spoken. Then, until the 1940s this language based on Tupi was widely spoken in some Northern [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian]] areas where the Tupi people were not present.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In 1775, [[Marquês de Pombal]] prohibited the use of Língua geral or any other indigenous language in Brazil.

However, before that prohibition, the Portuguese language was dominant in Brazil. Most of the other Amerindian languages gradually disappeared as the populations that spoke them were integrated or decimated when the Portuguese-speaking population expanded to most of Brazil. The several African languages spoken{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} in Brazil also disappeared. Since the 20th century there are no more records of speakers of African languages in the country. However, in some isolated communities settled by escaped slaves ([[Quilombo]]) the Portuguese language spoken by its inhabitants still preserves some [[lexicon]] of African origin, which is not understood by other Brazilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labeurb.unicamp.br/elb/africanas/presenca_linguas_africanas_brasil_hoje.html Línguas Africanas]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the contact with several Amerindian and African languages, the Portuguese spoken in Brazil absorbed many influences from these languages, which led to a notable differentiation from the Portuguese spoken in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labeurb.unicamp.br/elb/indigenas/l_indigenas.html Línguas indígenas]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2010}}

Starting in the early 19th century, Brazil started to receive substantial immigration of non-Portuguese-speaking people from Europe and Asia. Most immigrants, particularly Italians&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/BR|title=Brazil|work=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spaniards, adopted the Portuguese language after a few generations. Other immigrants, particularly Germans, Japanese, Arabs, Poles and Ukrainians,&lt;ref name="ethnologue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnologue hunsrik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/hrx|title=Hunsrik|work=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt; preserved their languages for more generations. German-speaking&lt;ref&gt;"German" here meaning varied Germanic dialects spoken in Germany and other countries, not standard German.&lt;/ref&gt; immigrants started arriving in 1824. They came not only from Germany, but also from other countries that had a substantial German-speaking population ([[Switzerland]], [[Poland]], [[Austria]], [[Romania]] and [[Russia]] ([[Volga Germans]]). During over 100 years of continuous emigration, it is estimated that some 300,000 German-speaking immigrants settled in Brazil. [[Italian Brazilian|Italian immigration]] started in 1875 and about 1.5 million Italians immigrated to Brazil until World War II. They spoke several dialects from Italy. Other sources of immigration to Brazil included Spaniards, Poles, Ukrainians, Japanese and Middle-easterns. With the notable exception of the Germans, who preserved their language for several generations, and in some degree the [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Poles]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Arabs]], Kurds and [[Italians]], most of the immigrants in Brazil adopted Portuguese as their mother tongue after a few generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labeurb.unicamp.br/elb/europeias/europeias.htm Línguas europeias]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="língua alemã"&gt;[http://www.ucm.es/info/especulo/numero40/polingbr.html Políticas lingüísticas e a conservação da língua alemã no Brasil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portuguese==
[[File:MPL 066.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Museum of the Portuguese Language]] in the city of [[São Paulo]].]]
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official language of Brazil, and is the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio and TV. It is used for all business and administrative purposes. Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, giving it a national culture sharply distinct from its Spanish-speaking neighbours and also being a major factor contributing to the differentiation between Brazilians and people from the rest of South America. [[Brazilian Portuguese]] has had its own development, influenced by the other European Languages such as Italian in the South and Southeast, Native American and African Languages in the Northeast. Due to this, the language is somewhat different from that spoken in [[Portugal]] and other Portuguese-speaking countries, mainly due to phonological differences,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} of similar importance to the differences between [[British English]] and [[American English]].

During the 18th century, other differences between the Brazilian and European Portuguese developed, mainly through the introduction of lexicon from African and Tupi languages, such as words related to fauna and flora. At that time [[Brazilian Portuguese]] failed to adopt linguistic changes taking place in Portugal produced by French influence.{{Which|date=May 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The Brazilian Portuguese remained loyal to the pronunciation used at the time of its discovery. However, when Don João, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] king, and the royal entourage took refuge in Brazil in 1808 (when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded Portugal), he influenced the Portuguese spoken in the cities, making it more similar to the Portuguese of Portugal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} After Brazilian independence in 1822, Brazilian Portuguese became influenced by Europeans who had migrated to the country.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This is the reason that, in those areas (such as [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Recife]]), one finds variations in [[pronunciation]] (for instance, [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of post-vocalic /s/) and a few superficial lexical changes.{{Which|date=May 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} These changes reflect the linguistics of the [[Countries|nationalities]] settling in each area.{{Which|date=May 2010}} In the 20th century, the divide between the Portuguese and Brazilian variants of Portuguese widened as the result of new words for technological [[innovation]]s. This happened because Portuguese lacked a uniform procedure for adopting such words.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Certain words took different forms in different countries. For example: in [[Portugal]] one hears "comboio," and in [[Brazil]] one hears "trem", both meaning train. "Autocarro" in Portugal is the same thing as "ônibus" in Brazil, both meaning [[bus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbilat.com/Languages/Portuguese-Brazilian/Brazilian-External_History.html History – Brazilian Portuguese]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minority languages==
Despite the fact that Portuguese is the official language of Brazil and the vast majority of Brazilians speak only Portuguese, there are several other languages spoken in the country. According to the president of [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) there are an estimated 210 languages spoken in Brazil. Eighty{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} are Amerindian languages, while the others are languages brought by immigrants. The 1950 Census was the last one to ask Brazilians which language they speak at home. Since then, the Census does not ask about language. However, the Census of 2010 asked respondents which languages they speak, allowing a better analysis of the languages spoken in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u618299.shtml Censo 2010 fará a soma de casais homossexuais]&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one of the indigenous languages, [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]], became an official language alongside Portuguese in the municipality of [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/international/americas/28amazon.html?ex=1282881600&amp;en=2dbb31357d010164&amp;ei=5090 Language Born of Colonialism Thrives Again in Amazon ] ''New York Times''.

===Immigrant languages===

====European immigrant languages====

According to the 1940 Census, after [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], German was the most widely spoken language in Brazil. Although the Italian immigration to Brazil was much more significant than the German one, the German language had many more speakers than the Italian one, according to the Census. The Census revealed that two-thirds of the children of German immigrants spoke German at home. In comparison, half of the children of [[Italians]] spoke Portuguese at home. The stronger preservation of the German language when compared to the Italian one has many factors: Italian is closer to Portuguese than German, leading to a faster assimilation of the [[Italian language|Italian speakers]]. (One might compare this to the United States, where a huge wave of [[German-Americans|German immigrants]] almost completely switched to English and assimilated more thoroughly than the Italian-Americans.) Also, the German immigrants used to educate their children in German schools. The Italians, on the other hand, had less organized ethnic schools and the cultural formation was centered in church, not in schools. Most of the children of Italians went to public schools, where Portuguese was spoken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbhe.org.br/novo/congressos/cbhe3/Documentos/Individ/Eixo4/178.pdf The Italian Immigration and Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Until World War II, some 1.5 million Italians had immigrated to Brazil, compared to only 250,000 Germans. However, the 1940 Census revealed that German was spoken as a home language by 644,458 people, compared to only 458,054 speakers of Italian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/monografias/GEBIS%20-%20RJ/CD1940/Censo%20Demografico%201940%20VII_Brasil.pdf Census of 1940]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spaniards]], who formed the third largest immigrant group in Brazil (after the Portuguese and Italians) were also quickly assimilated into the Portuguese-speaking majority. Spanish is similar to Portuguese, which led to a fast assimilation. Moreover, many of the Spanish immigrants were from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], where they also speaks [[Galician language|Galician]], which is closer to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], sometimes even being considered two dialects of the same language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proceedings.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=MSC0000000012002000200006&amp;script=sci_arttext#tx02 Spanish people in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etni-cidade.net/espanhois.htm O Brasil como país de destino para imigrantes]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the large influx of Spanish immigrants to Brazil from 1880 to 1930 (over 700,000 people) the Census of 1940 revealed that only 74,000 people spoke Spanish in Brazil.

Other languages such as [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], along with German and Italian, are spoken in rural areas of Southern Brazil, by small communities of descendants of immigrants, who are for the most part bilingual. There are whole regions in southern Brazil where people speak both Portuguese and one or more of these languages. For example, it is reported that more than 90% of the residents of the small city of [[Presidente Lucena]], located in the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], speak [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]], a Brazilian form of the [[Hunsrückisch|Hunsrückisch dialect]] of German.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rotaromantica.com.br/ Rota Romântica].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Região da Liberdade - São Paulo - Brasil.JPG|right|thumb|[[Liberdade (district of São Paulo)|Liberdade]], São Paulo, concentrates the largest Japanese population outside Japan.]]
Some immigrant communities in southern Brazil, chiefly the [[Ethnic German|German]] and the [[Italians|Italian]] ones, have lasted long enough to develop distinctive dialects from their original European sources. For example, [[Brazilian German]], also known as Riograndenser Hunsrückisch. In the [[Serra Gaúcha]] region, we can find [[Italian language|Italian dialects]] such as [[Talian dialect|Talian]] or ''italiano riograndense'', based on the [[Venetian language]].

Other German dialects were transplanted to this part of Brazil. For example, the [[Austria]]n dialect spoken in [[Dreizehnlinden]] or [[Treze Tílias]] in the state of [[Santa Catarina State|Santa Catarina]]; or the dialect Schwowisch (Standard German: "Schwäbisch"), from [[Danube Swabians|Donauschwaben]] immigrants, is spoken in Entre Rios, [[Guarapuava]], in the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]; or the [[East Pomeranian dialect|East Pomeranian]] dialect spoken in many different parts of southern Brazil (in the states of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Santa Catarina State|Santa Catarina]], Paraná, Espírito Santo, [[State of São Paulo|São Paulo]], etc.). [[Plautdietsch]] is spoken by the descendants of [[Russian Mennonite]]s. However, these languages have been rapidly replaced by Portuguese in the last few decades, partly due to a government decision to integrate immigrant populations. Today, states like [[Rio Grande do Sul]] are trying to reverse that trend and immigrant languages such as German and Italian are being reintroduced into the curriculum again, in communities where they originally thrived. Meanwhile, on the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] and [[Uruguay]]an border regions, Brazilian students are being introduced to the Spanish language.

====Asian languages====
In the city of [[São Paulo]], [[Korean language|Korean]], Chinese and Japanese can be heard in the immigrants districts, like [[Liberdade (district of São Paulo)|Liberdade]].
A Japanese-language newspaper, the ''[[São Paulo Shinbun]]'', has been published in the city of [[São Paulo]] since 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camara.sp.gov.br/noticias_detalhe.asp?id=190 São Paulo Shimbun – Brazilian Newspaper in Japanese] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214233929/http://www.camara.sp.gov.br/noticias_detalhe.asp?id=190 |date=14 February 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant community of Japanese speakers in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]],  [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], Mato Grosso do Sul, Pará and Amazonas. Much smaller groups exist in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], Rio Grande do Sul and other parts of [[Brazil]]. Some Chinese, especially from [[Macau]], speak a Portuguese-based [[creole language]] called [[Macanese Patois|Macanese]] (''patuá'' or ''macaísta''), aside from Hakka, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]]. Brazil has the largest Japanese population outside of Japan.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==indigenous languages==

Many Amerindian [[minority language]]s are spoken throughout Brazil, mostly in Northern Brazil. Indigenous languages with about 10,000 speakers or more are [[Ticuna language|Ticuna]] (language isolate), [[Kaingang language|Kaingang]] (Gean family), [[Kaiwá language|Kaiwá Guarani]], [[Nheengatu]] (Tupian), [[Guajajára language|Guajajára]] (Tupian), [[Macushi language|Macushi]] (Cariban), [[Terêna language|Terena]] (Arawakan), [[Xavante language|Xavante]] (Gean) and [[Mawé language|Mawé]] (Tupian). [[Tucano language|Tucano]] (Tucanoan) has half that number, but is widely used as a second language in the Amazon.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

One of the two Brazilian ''[[Língua Geral|línguas gerais]]'' (general languages), [[Nheengatu]], was until the late 19th century the common language used by a large number of indigenous, European,  African, and [[Afro-Brazilian|African-descendant]] peoples throughout the coast of [[Brazil]]—it was spoken by the majority of the population in the land. It was proscribed by the [[Marquis of Pombal]] for its association with the [[Jesuit Reductions|Jesuit missions]]. A recent resurgence in popularity of this language occurred, and it is now an official language in the city of [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]]. Today, in the [[Amazon Basin]], political campaigning is still printed in this [[Tupian languages|Tupian language]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Bilingualism==

[[File:Kolonien Suedbrasilien.png|thumb|right|[[German Brazilian|German]] colonies in [[Southern Brazil]].]]

Spanish is understood to various degrees by many but not all Brazilians, due to the similarities of the languages. However, it is hardly spoken well by individuals who have not taken specific education in the language, due to the substantial differences in [[phonology]] between the two languages. In some parts of Brazil, close to the border of Brazil with Spanish-speaking countries, Brazilians will use a rough mixture of Spanish and Portuguese that is sometimes known as [[Portuñol]] to communicate with their neighbors on the other side of the border; however, these Brazilians continue to speak Portuguese at home. In recent years, Spanish has become more popular as a second or third language in Brazil due in large part to the economic advantages that Spanish fluency brings in doing business with other countries in the region, since seven of the 11 countries that border Brazil use Spanish as an official language but falls behind English due to lack of interest by Brazilians in learning Spanish.

In [[São Paulo]], the [[Deutschbrasilianer|German-Brazilian]] newspaper ''Brasil-Post'' has been published for over fifty years. There are many other media organizations throughout the land specializing either in church issues, music, language etc.

The online newspaper ''La Rena'' is in [[Talian dialect|Talian]] dialect and it offers Talian lessons. There are many other non-Portuguese publications, bilingual web sites, radio and television programs throughout the country.

On the [[Paraná state|Paraná]] state, there are several communities of [[Poles]], [[Ukrainians]] and other [[Slavics]] that live in rural areas and in some municipalities such as [[Curitiba]], [[Irati, Paraná|Irati]], [[Guarapuava]], [[Ponta Grossa]] and [[Prudentópolis]]. [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] are still spoken, mainly by oldest people. In the City of [[Foz do Iguaçu]] (on the border with [[Paraguay]] and [[Argentina]]), there are many [[Arabic language|Arabic]] speakers, these people are mainly immigrants from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]].

On the [[Rio Grande do Sul]] state, there are several German and Italian colonized cities, communities and groups. Most small cities have German or Italian as their second language. In the capital [[Porto Alegre]], it is easy to find people who speak one of those or both.

There are also at least two [[Ethnic enclave|ethnic neighborhoods]] in the country: [[Liberdade (district of São Paulo)|Liberdade]], bastion of [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese immigrants]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portal-bairro-liberdade.com.br/ Portal do Bairro Liberdade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/imigracaojaponesa/historia.php História da Imigração Japonesa]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bixiga]], stronghold of [[Italian Brazilian|Italian immigrants]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111021043349/http://www.cidadedesaopaulo.com/sp/br/o-que-visitar/500-bairro-do-bixiga Bairro do Bixiga]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://origineitaliana.blogspot.ca/2009/09/fotos-do-bairro-do-bixiga-em-sao-paulo.html Bairro do Bixiga, reduto italiano em São Paulo]&lt;/ref&gt; both in [[São Paulo]]; however, these neighborhoods do not count yet with specific [[legislation]] for the protection of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] [[language]]s in these sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://viagem.hsw.uol.com.br/sao-paulo-turismo4.htm |title=Bexiga e Liberdade |access-date=5 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120061241/http://viagem.hsw.uol.com.br/sao-paulo-turismo4.htm |archive-date=20 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.letras.up.pt/aphes29/data/4th/AnaLuciaDuarteLanna_Texto.pdf Os italianos de Bixiga, São Paulo]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Co-official languages in Brazil==

This century has seen the growth of a trend of co-official languages in cities populated by immigrants (such as Italian and German) or indigenous in the north, both with support from the Ministry of Tourism, as was recently established in [[Santa Maria de Jetibá]], [[Pomerode]] and [[Vila Pavão]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.secult.es.gov.br/?id=/aqui_tem_cultura/artigos/materia.php&amp;cd_matia=1371 |title=Vila Pavão, Uma Pomerânia no norte do Espírito Santo |language=Portuguese |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where German also has co-official status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leismunicipais.com.br/twitter/222/legislacao/lei-2251-2010-pomerode-sc.html |title=Pomerode institui língua alemã como co-oficial no Município. |language=Portuguese |accessdate=9 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530095532/http://www.leismunicipais.com.br/twitter/222/legislacao/lei-2251-2010-pomerode-sc.html |archivedate=30 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

[[Image:Map - DR Congo, major languages.svg|thumb|right|300px|The geographical distribution of the four national languages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]

The '''[[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]''' is a multilingual country where an estimated total of 242 languages are spoken. [[Ethnologue]] lists 215 living languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CD Languages of Democratic Republic of the Congo], ethnologue.com&lt;/ref&gt; The [[official language]], inherited from the colonial period, is [[French language|French]]. Four indigenous languages have the status of [[national language]]: [[Kituba]] (called "Kikongo"), [[Lingala language|Lingala]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Luba-Kasai language|Tshiluba]].

When the country was a Belgian colony, it had already instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools, making it one of the few African nations to have had literacy in local languages during the European colonial period. During the colonial period Dutch and French were the official languages but French was by far the more important.

== French ==
[[File:Connaisance du français en RDC (2005).PNG|thumb|right|400px|Knowledge of French language in the DRC in 2005 according to the OIF.]]
{{see also|African French}}
[[French language|French]] is the official language of the country since its colonial period under [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian]] rule. Therefore, the variety of French used in the DRC has many similarities with [[Belgian French]]. French has been maintained as the official language since the time of independence because it is widely spoken around the educated groups in the country,  it belongs to none of the indigenous ethnic groups and eases communication between them as well as with the rest of the [[Francophonie]], which includes many African countries. According to a 2014 [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|OIF]] report, 33 million Congolese people (47% of the population) can read and write in French.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the capital city [[Kinshasa]], 67% of the population can read and write French, and 68.5% can speak and understand it.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic Republic of the Congo currently has the largest French-speaking population of any country outside France.

== Kikongo ==
The [[Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|constitution]] says [[Kongo language|Kikongo]] is one of the national languages, but in fact it is a Kikongo-based creole, [[Kituba]] (''Kikongo ya Leta'' "Kikongo of the government", ''Leta'' being derived from French ''l'État'' "the State") that is used in the constitution and by the administration in the provinces of [[Bas-Congo]] (which is inhabited by the [[Bakongo]]), [[Kwango District|Kwango]], and [[Kwilu District|Kwilu]]. Kituba has become a [[vernacular language]] in many urban centres including [[Kikwit]], [[Bandundu, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Bandundu]], [[Matadi]], [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]] and [[Muanda]].

== Lingala ==
[[Lingala language|Lingala]] is a language which gained its modern form in the colonial period, with the push of missionaries to standardize and teach a local ''[[lingua franca]]''. It was originally spoken in the [[Lualaba River|upper Congo]] river area but rapidly spread to the middle Congo area and eventually became the major [[Bantu language]] in Kinshasa for many reasons.

Lingala was made the official language of the army under [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]], but since the rebellions, the army has also used Swahili in the east. With the transition period and the consolidation of different armed groups into the Congolese Army, the linguistic policy has returned to its previous form and Lingala is again the official language of the Army.

== Swahili ==
[[Swahili language|Swahili]] is the most widespread ''lingua franca'' spoken in Eastern [[Equatorial Africa]]. Many variations of Swahili are spoken in the country but the major one is Kingwana, sometimes called ''Copperbelt Swahili'', especially in the Katanga area.

== Tshiluba ==
The constitution does not specify which of the two major variations of [[Tshiluba]] is the national language. [[Luba-Kasai]] is spoken in the [[East Kasai Region]] ([[Luba people]]) and [[Luba-Lulua]] is used in the [[West Kasai Region]] among the [[Bena Lulua people]]. Luba-Kasai seems to be the language used by the administration. A related language, known as [[Luba-Katanga language|Luba-Katanga]], is spoken in [[Katanga Province]].

== Sign languages ==
There are 12 deaf institutions in the country, and most teach [[French Sign Language]] or variations.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[American Sign Language]] is also practiced in the country.

== Other languages ==
The most notable other languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are [[Mashie language|Mashie]], [[Mongo language|Mongo]], [[Lunda language|Lunda]], [[Lega language|Kilega]], [[Tetela language|Tetela]], [[Chokwe language|Chokwe]], [[Budza language|Budza]], [[Ngbandi language|Ngbandi]], [[Lendu language|Lendu]], [[Mangbetu language|Mangbetu]], [[Nande language|Nande]], [[Ngbaka language|Ngbaka]], [[Zande language|Zande]], [[Lugbara language|Lugbara]] and [[Komo language (Bantu)|Komo]].

As of 2010 the government decided to include [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as an optional language at schools as a reflex of Brazil's increasing influence on the continent, and of the growing and considerable Angolan and Mozambican immigrant communities.&lt;ref name="TSF"&gt;[[TSF (radio station)|TSF]]. (July 4th). ''[https://tsf.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/Portugal/Interior.aspx?content_id=1585824 Português adoptado como língua opcional nas escolas da RD Congo]'', accessed on July 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[slang]]s spoken in the Congo, [[Indubil]] has been noted since around the sixties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ghetto Blaster : Et la rumba congolaise rythma les indépendances|url=http://www.sebtheplayer.com/ghetto-blaster-et-la-rumba-congolaise-rythma-les-independances/|accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to evolve today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The spread of Indubil through DR Congo: context and modalities |author=Georges Mulumbwa Mutambwa |url=http://www.vad-ev.de/2010/index.php/en/programme/zu-den-panels/panels-papers/doc_view/120-mutambwa-the-spread-of-indubil-through-dr-congo |accessdate=20 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719111839/http://www.vad-ev.de/2010/index.php/en/programme/zu-den-panels/panels-papers/doc_view/120-mutambwa-the-spread-of-indubil-through-dr-congo |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Simplified Languages of Europe map.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the major languages in Europe]]
The '''languages of the European Union''' are [[language]]s used by people within the member states of the [[European Union]] (EU).

The EU has 24 [[official language]]s, of which three ([[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]) have the higher status of "procedural" languages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-825_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - Frequently asked questions on languages in Europe|website=europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[European Commission]] (whereas the [[European Parliament]] accepts all official languages as [[working language]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europarlamentti.info/en/European-parliament/working-languages/|title=EU|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). One language ([[Irish language|Irish]]) previously had the lower status of "treaty language" before being upgraded to an official and working language in 2007, although it has been temporarily derogated as a working language until 2021 due to difficulty finding qualified translators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/gaeilge-irish-lost-in-translation-translators-eu-parliament-brussels/|title=Irish lost in translation|date=2017-03-10|work=POLITICO|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370204.htm|title=Publications Office — Interinstitutional style guide — 7.2.4. Rules governing the languages in the institutions|last=OP/B.3/CRI|first=Publications Office -|website=publications.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three procedural languages are those used in the day-to-day workings of the [[institutions of the EU]]. The designation of Irish as a "treaty language" meant that only primary legislation (the treaties) was to be translated into Irish, whereas secondary legislation (Directives and Regulations) did not have to be.

The EU asserts that it is in favour of linguistic diversity. This principle is enshrined in the EU [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter]] (art. 22) and in the [[Treaty on European Union|Treaty]] on European Union (art. 3(3) TEU).

In the European Union, [[language policy]] is the responsibility of member states and EU does not have a common language policy; European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, based on the principle of "[[subsidiarity]]", they promote a European dimension in the member states' language policies. The EU encourages all its citizens to be [[multilingualism|multilingual]]; specifically, it encourages them to be able to speak two languages in addition to their [[First language|native language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2003:0449:FIN:en:PDF |format=PDF|title=COM(2003)449: Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity: an Action Plan 2004–2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the EU has very limited influence in this area as the content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states, a number of EU funding programmes actively promote [[language learning]] and [[linguistic diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/archive/policy/index_en.html |title=EUROPA – Education and Training – Action Plan Promoting language learning and linguistic diversity |publisher=European Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418200434/http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/archive/policy/index_en.html |archivedate=18 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely spoken language in the EU is English, which is understood by 51% of all adults, while German is the most widely used mother tongue, spoken by 18%. All 24 official languages of the EU are accepted as [[#Working languages|working languages]], but in practice only two – English and French – are in wide general use and of these English&lt;ref name="parliamentlanguage"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/datablog/2014/may/21/european-parliament-english-language-official-debates-data European parliament has 24 official languages, but MEPs prefer English], theguardian 21 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irishtimesremainworking"&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/english-will-remain-the-working-language-of-the-eu-after-brexit-1.2725840 English will remain the working language of the EU after Brexit], The Irish Times 18 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hübner"&gt;[https://www.politico.eu/article/english-will-not-be-an-official-eu-language-after-brexit-senior-mep/ English will not be an official EU language after Brexit, says senior MEP], Politico Europe 27 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economistanglo"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21721861-despite-jean-claude-junckers-joke-anglophones-should-rest-easy-britain-leaving-eu-its Britain is leaving the EU, but its language will stay], The Economist 13 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; is the more commonly used. [[French language|French]] is an [[official language]] in all three of the cities that are [[Location of European Union institutions|political centres]] of the Union: [[Brussels]] ([[Languages of Belgium|Belgium]]), [[Strasbourg]] ([[Language policy in France|France]]) and [[Luxembourg City]] ([[Languages of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]]).

The number of member states exceeds the number of official languages, as several national languages are shared by two or more countries in the EU. [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are all official languages at the national level in multiple countries (see table above). In addition, [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Slovene language|Slovene / Slovenian]] are official languages in multiple EU countries at the regional level.

Furthermore, not all national languages have been accorded the status of official EU languages. These include [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], an official language of Luxembourg since 1984, and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], an official language of [[Cyprus]].

All languages of the EU are also [[working language]]s.&lt;ref name="Official EU languages" /&gt; Documents which a member state or a person subject to the jurisdiction of a member state sends to institutions of the Community may be drafted in any one of the official languages selected by the sender. The reply is drafted in the same language. Regulations and other documents of general application are drafted in the twenty-four official languages. The ''[[Official Journal of the European Union]]'' is published in the twenty-four official languages.

Legislation and documents of major public importance or interest are produced in all official languages, but that accounts for a minority of the institutions′ work. Other documents—e.g.,&amp;nbsp;communications with the national authorities, decisions addressed to particular individuals or entities and correspondence—are translated only into the languages needed. For internal purposes the EU institutions are allowed by law to choose their own language arrangements. The [[European Commission]], for example, conducts its internal business in three languages, [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]] (sometimes called "procedural languages"), and goes fully multilingual only for public information and communication purposes. The [[European Parliament]], on the other hand, has members who need working documents in their own languages, so its document flow is fully multilingual from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/languages/en/document/59#5 Europa:Languages and Europe. FAQ: Is every document generated by the EU translated into all the official languages?], ''Europa'' portal. Retrieved 6 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institutions of the European Union|Non-institutional EU bodies]] are not legally obliged to make language arrangement for all the 24 languages (''Kik v. [[Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market]]'', [http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?lang=en&amp;num=79969090C19010361&amp;doc=T&amp;ouvert=T&amp;seance=ARRET Case C-361/01], 2003 [[European Court of Justice|ECJ]] I-8283).

The linguistic translations are expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0222_050222_translation.html |title=With 20 Official Languages, Is EU Lost in Translation? |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the EU's English-language website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/languages/en/document/59#8 Europa:Languages and Europe. FAQ: What does the EU's policy of multilingualism cost?], ''Europa'' portal. Retrieved 6 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the cost of maintaining the institutions’ policy of multilingualism—i.e.,&amp;nbsp;the cost of translation and interpretation—was €1,123 million in 2005, which is 1% of the annual general budget of the EU, or €2.28 per person per year. The EU Parliament has made clear that its member states have autonomy for language education, which by treaty the European Community must respect.&lt;ref name="esperanto"&gt;{{cite web|author=cs – čeština |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2006-3653+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN |title=Written question – Public policy on foreign-language teaching: the Grin Report – E-3653/2006 |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=2006-12-30 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language families===
{{wide image|Eu-official-languages-tree.svg|1080px|Language family tree of EU official languages}}
The vast majority of EU languages belong to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family|family]], the three dominant subfamilies being the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]. Germanic languages are spoken in central and northern Europe and include Danish, Dutch, English, German, and Swedish. Romance languages are spoken in western, southern European regions; they include French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish. The Slavic languages are to be found in the [[central Europe]] and the [[Balkans]] in southern Europe. They include Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Polish, Slovak, and Slovene. The [[Baltic languages]], Latvian and Lithuanian; the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] languages, including Irish; and [[Greek language|Greek]] are also Indo-European.

Outside the Indo-European family, Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian are [[Uralic languages]] while Maltese is the only [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language]] with official status in the EU. The [[Basque language]], a [[language isolate]] whose roots are unknown, is an official language in some parts of northern Spain, but not an official language of the EU.

===Writing systems===
[[File:EUR 10 obverse (2014 issue).png|thumb|[[10 euro note]] from the new Europa series written in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] alphabets (EURO and ΕΥΡΩ, respectively), and also in the [[Bulgarian alphabet|Cyrillic]] alphabet (ЕВРО), as a result of [[Bulgaria]] joining the European Union in 2007.]]
Most official EU languages are written in the [[Latin script]]. The two exceptions are [[Greek language|Greek]], which is written in the [[Greek script]], and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], which is written in [[Cyrillic script]]. With the [[accession of Bulgaria to the European Union]] on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the [[European Union]], following the Latin and Greek scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease|author1=Leonard Orban|title=Cyrillic, the third official alphabet of the EU, was created by a truly multilingual European|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-07-330_en.pdf|format=PDF|website=Europe.eu|accessdate=3 August 2014|date=24 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current design of [[euro banknotes]] has the word ''euro'' written in both the Latin and Greek (Ευρώ) alphabets; the Cyrillic spelling (Eвро) was added to the new Europa series of banknotes started in 2013 (see [[Linguistic issues concerning the euro]]).

===Language-specific regulations===
====Maltese====
Although [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is an official language, the Council set a transitional period of three years from 1 May 2004, during which the institutions were not obliged to draft all acts in Maltese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0930:EN:NOT |title=EUR-Lex – 32004R0930 – EN |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was agreed that the Council could extend this transitional period by an additional year, but decided not to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R1738:EN:NOT |title=EUR-Lex – 32006R1738 – EN |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu }}&lt;/ref&gt; All new acts of the institutions were required to be adopted and published in Maltese from 30 April 2007.

==== Irish ====
When [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] joined the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] (now the [[European Union|EU]]) in 1973, [[Irish language|Irish]] was accorded ''"Treaty Language"'' status. This meant that the founding [[Treaty of Rome|EU Treaty]] was restated in Irish. Irish was also listed in that Treaty and all subsequent EU Treaties as one of the authentic languages of the Treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/index.asp?locID=404&amp;docID=3111 |title=Taoiseach Website Press Release dated 1 January 2007 |publisher=Taoiseach.gov.ie }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Treaty Language, Irish was an official procedural language of the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Fottrell, Bill Bowring – 1999 Minority and Group Rights in the New Millennium.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also possible to correspond in written Irish with the EU Institutions.

However, despite being the first official language of the [[Republic of Ireland]] and having been accorded minority-language status in the [[UK]] region of [[Northern Ireland]], Irish was not made an official working language of the EU until 1 January 2007. On that date an EU Council Regulation making Irish an official working language of the EU came into effect.&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32005R0920:EN:NOT Council Regulation (EC) No 920/2005].]&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a unanimous decision on 13 June 2005 by EU foreign ministers that Irish would be made the 21st official language of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/85437.pdf|format=PDF|title=Decision made at 667th Meeting of the Council of the European Union, Luxembourg|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016091800/http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/85437.pdf|archivedate=16 October 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[derogation]] stipulates that not all documents have to be translated into Irish as is the case with the other official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32005R0920:EN:NOT |title=EUR-Lex – 32005R0920 – EN |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=cs – čeština |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&amp;type=IM-PRESS&amp;reference=20050928IPR00827 |title=Stádas na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach – Status of Irish in the EU |publisher=European Parliament }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation means that legislation approved by both the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] is translated into Irish, and interpretation from Irish is available at [[European Parliament]] plenary sessions and some Council meetings. The cost of translation, interpretation, publication, and legal services involved in making Irish an official EU language is estimated at just under €3.5 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10002211.shtml |title=EU to hire 30 Irish translators at cost of €3.5 million |publisher=Finfacts.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 3, 2015, a new regulation passed by the Council has set a definitive schedule on the gradual reduction of the derogation of the Irish language. This new regulation outlines an actual schedule of gradual reduction spread across five years starting from 2016. If EU institutions have sufficient available translation capacity, and if no other Council regulations state otherwise, the derogation completely ends by January 2022.&lt;ref&gt;Gino Dino, 11 December 2015, https://slator.com/demand-drivers/ireland-ramps-translator-hiring-irish-gaelic-gets-nod-eu/, retrieved 1 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish is the only official language of the Union that is not the most widely spoken language in any member state. According to the 2006 Irish census figures, there are 1.66&amp;nbsp;million people in Ireland with some ability to speak Irish, out of a population of 4.6&amp;nbsp;million, though only 538,500 use Irish on a daily basis (counting those who use it mainly in the education system) and just over 72,000 use Irish as a daily language outside the education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|format=PDF|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/census2006results/volume_9/volume_9_press_release.pdf|title=2006 Census of Population – Volume 9 – Irish Language|agency=Central Statistics Office|date=4 October 2007|dead-url=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120095349/http://www.cso.ie/census/census2006results/volume_9/volume_9_press_release.pdf|archive-date=20 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin====
Due to the close similarity between Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin{{spaced ndash}}which are mutually intelligible{{spaced ndash}}it was proposed that only one hybrid language be accepted as an official EU language as opposed to four separate ones (as in the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]) in order to reduce translation costs. In negotiations with [[Croatia]], however, it was accepted that Croatian would become a separate official EU language.&lt;ref&gt;Palokaj, Augistin (24 November 2010) [http://euobserver.com/news/31340 "Croatian to Become 24th EU Language"], ''EUobserver''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future of English in the EU===
{{main|Impact of Brexit on the European Union#Languages}}
When the United Kingdom and Ireland joined the EU's predecessor in 1973, [[French language|French]] was the dominant language of the institutions. With the addition of Sweden and Finland in the 1990s, and the Eastern European states in the 2000s, English slowly supplanted French as the dominant working language of the institutions. In 2015, it was estimated that 80% of legislative proposals were drafted first in English. The role of English as a [[lingua franca]] is believed to be likely to continue, given how heavily staff rely on it.&lt;ref name="irishtimesremainworking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hübner"/&gt;

The interpretation of the legal rules covering the use of Official Languages has been open to speculation following the result of the [[Brexit]] referendum. Danuta Hübner, the head of the European Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee, has claimed that, after Brexit, English will no longer be an official EU language.&lt;ref name="Hübner"/&gt; However, this statement has been contradicted by the European Commission Representation in Ireland, whose spokesperson described Ms Hübner's claim as "incorrect",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/english-language-will-not-be-banned-from-eu-after-brexit-despite-claims-34840768.html English language will NOT be banned from EU after Brexit, despite claims], independent.ie 28 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] in an answer to a Parliamentary Question on 9 August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=WQ&amp;reference=E-2017-003658&amp;language=EN|title=Written question - Language in the EU   - E-003658/2017|author=|date=|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional, minority and other languages==
&lt;!--This sections follows Euromosaic study, conducted for the European Commission. Languages from this study not yet completely incorporated. Please do not add or omit languages or change their name arbitrarily. This study does not yet cover Bulgaria and Romania, the two latest members states. --Michkalas 20:42, 27 March 2007 (UTC) --&gt;
According to the Euromosaic study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/languages-of-europe/doc145_en.htm|title=Oooops... We didn't find the page you are looking for...|date=12 March 2012|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; some [[regional language|regional]] or [[minority language]]s spoken within the EU do not have official recognition at EU level. Some of them may have some official status within the member state and count many more speakers than some of the lesser-used official languages. The official languages of EU are in '''bold'''.

In the list those idioms deemed by member states as mere [[dialect]]s of an official language are not included. However many of these dialects are often viewed  as separate languages: [[Scots language|Scots]]—the [[Germanic language]] descended from [[Old English]], not the [[Celtic language]] known as [[Scottish Gaelic]]—and several [[Romance languages]] spoken in Portugal, France and Italy, such as [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]], [[Lombard language|Lombard]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]], [[Venetian language|Venetian]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]].

===Languages of France===
The [[French constitution]] stipulates French as the sole language of the Republic. Since the [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008|2008 modifications]], article 75-1 of the Constitution adds that "regional languages form part of the French heritage".

Nevertheless, there exist a number of languages spoken by sizeable minorities, such as [[Breton language|Breton]] (a Celtic language), [[Basque language|Basque]], and several Romance languages such as [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]] and the various [[langues d'oïl]] (other than French), as well as Germanic languages spoken in Alsace-Lorraine (Central Franconian, High Franconian, Luxembourgish, and Alemannic) and French Flanders (Dutch).

These languages enjoy no official status under the French state and regions are not permitted to bestow any such status themselves. Since December 2004, Breton and Gallo are officially recognized in [[Brittany]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Languages of Spain's autonomous communities===
The Spanish governments have sought to give some official status in the EU for the languages of the [[autonomous communities of Spain]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]]/[[Valencian language|Valencian]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Basque language|Basque]]. The 667th Council Meeting of the [[Council of the European Union]] in Luxembourg on 13 June 2005, decided to authorise limited use at EU level of languages recognised by member states other than the official working languages. The Council granted recognition to "languages other than the languages referred to in Council Regulation No 1/1958 whose status is recognised by the Constitution of a Member State on all or part of its territory or the use of which as a national language is authorised by law." The official use of such languages will be authorised on the basis of an administrative arrangement concluded between the Council and the requesting member state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/85437.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016091800/http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/85437.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician are not nationwide official languages in Spain, as co-official languages in the respective regions – pursuant to Spanish constitution, among other documents – they are eligible to benefit from official use in EU institutions under the terms of the 13 June 2005 resolution of the Council of the European Union. The Spanish government has assented to the provisions in respect of these languages.

The status of Catalan, spoken by over 9 million EU citizens (just over 1.8% of the total), has been the subject of particular debate. On 11 December 1990, the use of Catalan was the subject of a [[European Parliament]] Resolution (resolution A3-169/90 on languages in the [European] Community and the situation of Catalan).&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Journal of the European Union|OJ]] C19, 28 January 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 2005, the President [[Peter Straub (politician)|Peter Straub]] of the [[Committee of the Regions]] signed an agreement with the Spanish Ambassador to the EU, {{Interlanguage link multi|Carlos Bastarreche|es}}, approving the use of Spanish regional languages in an EU institution for the first time in a meeting on that day, with interpretation provided by  European Commission interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/scic/|title=DG Interpretation (DG SCIC) at the European Commission - Interpreting and Conference Service - Service d'intérpretation et conférence de la commission européenne|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/languages/en/document/81/6 |title=EUROPA-Languages-News-Spanish regional languages used for the first time |publisher=Europa (web portal) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Spanish regional languages are used for the first time in EU institutions: "it's a historic day for Europe", say Spanish regional Presidents|url=http://www.cor.europa.eu/en/press/press_05_11125.html|agency=European Union Committee of the Regions|date=16 November 2005|deadurl=y|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718034359/http://www.cor.europa.eu/en/press/press_05_11125.html|archivedate=18 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2006, the European Parliament's Bureau approved a proposal by the Spanish State to allow citizens to address the European Parliament in Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician, two months after its initial rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciemen.org/mercator/notidetail.cfm?IDA=897&amp;lg=gb |title=Mercator :: News |publisher=Ciemen.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003800/http://www.ciemen.org/mercator/notidetail.cfm?IDA=897&amp;lg=gb |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barcelonareporter.com/index.php/news/comments/catalan_government_welcomes_european_parliament_language_move/ |title=Catalan government welcomes European Parliament language move |publisher=Barcelonareporter.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709175546/http://www.barcelonareporter.com/index.php/news/comments/catalan_government_welcomes_european_parliament_language_move/ |archivedate=9 July 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November 2006, the [[European Ombudsman]], [[Nikiforos Diamandouros]], and the Spanish ambassador in the EU, Carlos Bastarreche, signed an agreement in Brussels to allow Spanish citizens to address complaints to the European Ombudsman in Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician, all four co-official languages in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/release/en/2006-11-30a.htm |title=European Ombudsman Press Release No. 19/2006 30.11.2006 |publisher=Europa (web portal) }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the agreement, a translation body, which will be set up and financed by the Spanish government, will be responsible for translating complaints submitted in these languages. In turn, it will translate the Ombudsman's decisions from Spanish into the language of the complainant. Until such a body is established the agreement will not become effective; so far the body has not been created nor there is any budget allocated to this end. This leaving Catalan speakers without access to EU institutions in their mother tongue.

Galician in particular, not being itself a European Parliament official language, can be used and is in fact used by some European Parliament constituents as a spoken dialect of Portuguese due to its similarity with this language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agal-gz.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1349 |title=O Galego já é oficial na UE [GL/PT] |publisher=Associaçom Galega da Lingua |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041030142629/http://www.agal-gz.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1349 |archivedate=30 October 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luxembourgish and Turkish===
[[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] ([[Luxembourg]]) and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ([[Cyprus]]) are the only two national languages that are not official languages of the EU. Neither Luxembourg nor Cyprus have yet used the provision of the 13 June 2005 resolution to benefit from use in official EU institutions. On 26 February 2016 it was made public that Cyprus has asked to make Turkish an official EU language, in a “gesture” that could help reunification and improve [[Turkey and the European Union|EU–Turkey]] relations.&lt;ref&gt;EU Observer, 26.2.2016, https://euobserver.com/institutional/132476&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 2004, it was planned that Turkish would become an official language when Cyprus reunites.&lt;ref&gt;See article 8 in [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52004PC0189&amp;qid=1470416385493 Proposal for an ACT OF ADAPTATION OF THE TERMS OF ACCESSION OF THE UNITED CYPRUS REPUBLIC TO THE EUROPEAN UNION]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Welsh and Scottish Gaelic===
On 15 July 2008 the EU Council approved the naming of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] as a co-official language of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/about_us/office_in_wales/welsh_language_en.htm|title=Welsh language in the EU|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish Gaelic]] received the same status in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2010/05/12090248|title=Gaelic spoken in Europe|publisher=The Scottish Parliament|date=11 May 2010|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romani===
The [[Romani people]], numbering over two million in the EU,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rom |title=Ethnologue |publisher=Ethnologue }}&lt;/ref&gt; speak the [[Romani language]], which is not official in any EU member state or polity. Moreover, [[Romani language|Romani]] mass media and educational institution presences are near-negligible.

===Russian===
Though not an official language of the European Union, [[Russian language|Russian]] is widely spoken in all member states [[former Soviet Union|that were part of the Soviet Union]] (and before that the [[Russian Empire]]). Russian is the native language of about 1.6 million [[Baltic Russians]] residing in [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], and [[Lithuania]], as well as a sizeable community of about [[Russians in Germany|3.5 million in Germany]] and as a major [[Languages of the European Union#Migrant languages|immigrant language elsewhere in the EU]]. Russian is also understood by a majority of ethnic Latvians, Estonians, and Lithuanians born before c. 1980, since, as official language of the [[Soviet Union]], it was a compulsory school subject in [[Baltic states under Soviet rule (1944–1991)|those countries during the Soviet era]]. To a lesser extent, this legacy also holds true among the older generation in parts of the EU that were formerly part of the [[Eastern bloc]], such as the [[GDR]].

On March 2010 fact-sheets in Russian produced by the EU executive's offices in Latvia were withdrawn, provoking criticism from [[Plaid Cymru]] MEP and [[European Free Alliance]] group President [[Jill Evans]] who called [[European Commission]] to continue to provide information in non-official EU languages and commented that "it's disappointing to hear that the EU is bowing to pressure to exclude Russian speakers in the Baltic in this way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/culture/russian-speakers-excluded-eu-bro-news-348045|title=Russian speakers ‘excluded’ from EU brochures in Latvia|work=EurActiv.com|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924003625/http://www.euractiv.com/culture/russian-speakers-excluded-eu-bro-news-348045|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sami languages ===
In Finland, the [[Sami languages]] [[Northern Sami]] (ca. 2000 speakers), [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]] (400) and [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]] (300) have limited local recognition in certain municipalities of [[Lapland (Finland)|Finnish Lapland]]. Furthermore, legislation specifically concerning the Sami must be translated to these languages. Bilingualism with Finnish is universal, though.

Three different Sami languages are spoken in Sweden, but "Sami language" (undifferentiated) is recognised as an official [[minority languages of Sweden|minority language in Sweden]], and is co-official with Swedish in four municipalities in [[Norrbotten County]] (Swedish Lapland). Most of Sami speakers speak [[Northern Sami]] (5,000–6,000 speakers), although there are ca. 1,000–2,000 [[Lule Sami language|Lule Sami]] speakers and 600 [[Southern Sami language|Southern Sami]] speakers.

===Latin===
For millennia, [[Latin]] has served as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' for administrative, scholarly, religious, political, etc. purposes in the area of the present-day European Union.  After the unique case of Athens and other Greek city-states of the 6th to 4th centuries B.C., the first documented political entity historically verifiable in Europe was the [[Roman Republic]] (traditionally founded in 509 B.C.) - the successor-state to [[Etruria|the Etruscan city-state confederacies]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Latin as a ''lingua franca'' of Europe was rivalled only by Greek.  It still served as the official language in universities in the 20th century, and has operated as the official language of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] until today.  Latin, along with Greek, has been at the core of education in Europe from the schools of rhetoric of the Roman Republic in all of its provinces and territories, through the medieval ''trivium'' and ''quadrivium'', through the humanists and the Renaissance, all the way to Newton's ''Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis'' (just to name one example of thousands of scientific works written in this language), to the public schools of all European countries, where Latin (along with Greek) is at the core of their curricula.  Latin served as the undisputed European ''lingua franca'' until the 19th century, when the cultures of unwritten languages and the "national languages" started to gain ground and claim status.  Today, several institutions of the European Union use Latin in their logos and [[domain name]]s instead of listing their names in all the official languages. For example, the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] has its website at "curia.europa.eu".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://curia.europa.eu/|title= CURIA|work= europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Auditors uses ''Curia Rationum'' in its logo. The Council of the European Union has its website at http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ and its logo showing ''Consilium''. The European Union itself has a Latin [[motto of the European Union|motto]]: "''In varietate concordia''". Under the [[European Company Regulation]], companies can be incorporated as ''Societas Europaea'' (Latin for "European Company", often shortened to "SE" after the company's own proper name).  Latin is one of the languages of [[IATE]] (the inter-institutional [[terminology database]] of the European Union).

===Esperanto===
[[Esperanto]] is part of the educational system in several member states. In Hungary it is officially recognised by the Ministry of Education as a foreign language;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eszperanto.hu/viva-kep4.htm|title=Tájékoztatom, hogy a Magyar Tudományos Akadémia Nyelvtudományi intézete 2004, január 6-ai ülésén döntést hozott arról, hogy az eszperantó elő idegen nyelvnek minősül.

Every year, since 2001, between 1000 and 3000 people have passed examinations in Esperanto, making up for a sum of more than 35,000 up to 2016; it is recognised by the Hungarian state.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.eszperanto.hu/hu-lernejo.htm Esperanto teaching in Hungary], [[:eo:Statistiko de Esperantujo#Hungario|Esperanto statistics]]; revuo Esperanto, 12/2010, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian census 2001 found 4575 Esperanto speakers in Hungary (4407 of them learned the language, for 168 of them it is a family or native language); In 2011 it found 8397 Esperanto speakers.&lt;ref&gt;The number should be higher, if one considers the number of about 35,000 Esperanto exams between 2001 and 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 25 years ago, in 1990 there were only 2083 Esperanto speakers in Hungary following the census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksh.hu/nepszamlalas/docs/tables/regional/00/00_1_1_4_2_en.xls|title=Hungarian Central Statistical Office – Census 2011, languages|author=|date=|website=ksh.hu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esperanto is not mentioned by the EU Commission as an EU language; the Commission mentions only official, indigenous regional and minority languages as well as languages of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance "[http://ec.europa.eu/languages/languages-of-europe/index_en.htm EU Languages and Language policy]" or "[http://ec.europa.eu/languages/orphans/european-day-of-languages_en.htm European Day of Languages]"&lt;/ref&gt; Following estimates there are approximately 100,000 Europeans sometimes using Esperanto (and several millions having learned Esperanto); the language has several thousand native speakers, some of them of the second or third generation.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Haarmann (2002, Kleines Lexikon der Sprachen. Von Albanisch bis Zulu. 2nd ed. Beck. {{ISBN|978-3-406-49423-9}}. p. 115/117) speaks about several thousand people speaking Esperanto as native language, see [http://www.fischer-zim.ch/esperanto/lingvaj-temoj/haarmann--leksikono-eo.htm Haarmann (Lexikon)]. Also [http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/esperanto-encyc.htm The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics], ed. R.E. Asher, Oxford: Pergamon, 1994 (vol. 3, pages 1143–1145).&lt;/ref&gt;

The European party [[Europe – Democracy – Esperanto]] seeks to establish the [[constructed language|planned language]] as an official [[second language]] in the EU in order to make international communication more efficient and fair in economical and philosophical terms. They are based on the conclusions of the Grin Report,&lt;ref name="grin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/var/storage/rapports-publics/054000678/0000.pdf|format=PDF|title=L'enseignement des langues étrangères comme politique publique|language=French|page=7|date=October 2005|accessdate=15 September 2013|last=Grin|first=François}}&lt;/ref&gt; which concluded that it would hypothetically allow savings to the EU of €25 billion a year (€54 for every citizen) and have other benefits. However, the EU Parliament has stated clearly that language education is the responsibility of member states.&lt;ref name="esperanto"/&gt;

The [[European Esperanto Union]] also promotes Esperanto as the [[international auxiliary language]] of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/news/world/2009/12/15/europe_marks_150th_birthday_of_esperanto_creator|title=AP News - Europe marks 150th birthday of Esperanto creator|first=AP|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migrant languages===
A wide variety of languages from other parts of the world are spoken by [[immigrant]] communities in EU countries. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] is spoken as a first language by an estimated 1% of the population in [[Belgium]] and the western part of [[Germany]], and by 1% in the [[Netherlands]]. Other widely used migrant languages include [[Berber languages]] which is spoken by about 1% of the population of both the Netherlands and Belgium and by many [[Berbers]] migrants in France, Spain, Italy and Germany. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is spoken in many EU countries mainly in its two varieties [[Maghrebi Arabic]] and [[Levantine Arabic]].  The [[Maghrebi Arabic]] is spoken by migrants in France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The [[Levantine Arabic]] is spoken by migrants in Germany, France, United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Greece. [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] are spoken by immigrants from the [[Indian sub-continent]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Languages from [[former Yugoslavia]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], etc.) are spoken in many parts of the EU by migrants and [[refugee]]s who have left the region as a result of the [[Yugoslav wars]] and unrest there.

There are large [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] communities in [[Chinese diaspora in France|France]], [[British Chinese|the UK]], [[Chinese people in Spain|Spain]], [[Chinese people in Italy|Italy]], and other countries. Some countries have [[Chinatowns]]. Old and recent Chinese migrants speak a number of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]], in particular [[Cantonese]] and other southern Chinese varieties. However, [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] is becoming increasingly more prevalent due to the opening of the [[People's Republic of China]].

There are many [[Russian diaspora|Russian-speaking immigrants]] in [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greece.mid.ru/rcnk_e_04.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227021306/http://www.greece.mid.ru/rcnk_e_04.html |archivedate=27 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]] and [[United Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Many immigrant communities in the EU have been in place for several generations now and their members are [[bilingual]], at ease both in the local language and in that of their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/comm/publications/booklets/move/45/en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Easy Reading Corner |publisher=Europa (web portal) }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sign languages===

A [[List of sign languages#Europe|wide variety]] of [[sign language]]s are used in the EU, with around 500,000 people using a sign language as their first language.&lt;ref name="commission sign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/sign-languages_en.htm |title=Sign languages |publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  None of these languages are recognised as an official language of an EU member state, and only two states (Finland and Portugal) refer to sign languages in their constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/e/social_cohesion/soc-sp/5720-0-ID2283-Langue%20signe_GB%20assemble.pdf |format=pdf |title=The status of sign languages in Europe |publisher=Council of Europe Publishing |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215843/http://www.coe.int/t/e/social_cohesion/soc-sp/5720-0-ID2283-Langue%20signe_GB%20assemble.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[NGO]]s exist which support signers, such as the [[European Union of the Deaf]] and the [[European Sign Language Centre]].  The European Commission has also supported some initiatives to produce digital technologies that can better support signers, such as Dicta-Sign and SignSpeak.&lt;ref name="commission sign"/&gt;

The sign languages in use in the EU are more difficult to [[Sign language#Classification|classify]] into [[language family|language families]] than the spoken languages, because of [[language contact]] and [[Creole language|creolization]].  Important families include the [[BANZSL|British]], [[French Sign Language family|French]], and [[German Sign Language family|German]] sign language families.

===Macedonian, Yiddish and Serbian===

[[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] are not official languages of the EU.

The five most spoken languages in the EU are [[English language|English]] (51%), [[German language|German]] (32%), [[French language|French]] (26%), [[Italian language|Italian]] (16%) and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (15%). At 18% of the total number of speakers, German is the most widely spoken native language, followed by Italian, English, French and Spanish. The knowledge of foreign languages varies considerably in the specific countries, as the table below shows. The most spoken second or foreign languages in the EU are English, French, German, Spanish, Russian and Italian. In the table, boxes coloured light blue mean that the language is an official language of the country, while the main language spoken in the country is coloured dark blue.

&lt;small&gt;1 Please note that this does not refer to the total population of the countries.''&lt;br /&gt;2 ''40% of those who speak French are native speakers, for a total of 85%.''&lt;br /&gt;3 ''Includes about 30% native speakers''&lt;br /&gt;4 ''Includes more than 30% native speakers''&lt;/small&gt;

56% of citizens in the EU member states are able to hold a conversation in one language apart from their native language. This is nine points higher than reported in 2001 among the 15 member states at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb55/eb55_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Report Number 55|website=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  28% of the respondents state that they speak two foreign languages well enough to have a conversation. Almost half of the respondents—44%—do not know any other language than their native language. Approximately 1 in 5 Europeans can be described as an active language learner (i.e., someone who has recently improved his/her language skills or intends to do so over the following 12 months).

English remains by far the most widely spoken foreign language throughout Europe. 95% of students in the EU study English at secondary level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Euobserver |url=http://euobserver.com/1016/113742 |title=News in Brief / English studied by 95% of EU students |work=EUobserver }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 38% of EU citizens state that they have sufficient skills in English to have a conversation (excluding citizens of the United Kingdom and Ireland, the two English-speaking countries). 28% of Europeans indicate that they know either French (14%) or German (14%), along with their native language. French is most commonly studied and used in southern Europe, especially in Mediterranean countries, in Germany, Portugal, Romania, the UK, and Ireland. German, on the other hand, is commonly studied and used in the Benelux countries, in Scandinavia, and in the newer EU member states. Spanish is most commonly studied in France, Italy, Luxembourg, and Portugal. In 19 out of 29 countries polled, English is the most widely known language apart from the native language, this being particularly the case in Sweden (89%), Malta (88%); the Netherlands (87%); and Denmark (86%). 77% of EU citizens believe that children should learn English. English was considered the number one language to learn in all countries where the research was conducted except for the United Kingdom, Ireland and Luxembourg. English, either as a native language or as a second/foreign language, is spoken by 51% of EU citizens, followed by German with 32% and French with 26%.

[[File:Deutsch-Français.png|thumb|The EU enlargements since 1990 have largely favoured the position of German relative to French. The only exceptions are Romania, Cyprus and Malta.&lt;br /&gt;'''Red:''' Countries where German is more known than French.&lt;br /&gt;'''Blue:''' Countries where French is more known than German.&lt;br /&gt;'''Darker colours:''' Native countries.&lt;br /&gt;'''Figure:''' year of accession.&lt;br /&gt;'''C:''' Candidate country.]]
With the enlargement of the European Union, the balance between French and German is slowly changing. More citizens in the new member states speak German (23% compared with 12% in the EU15) while fewer speak French or Spanish (3% and 1% respectively compared with 16% and 7% among the EU15 group). A notable exception is Romania, where 24% of the population speaks French as a foreign language compared to 6% who speak German as a foreign language. At the same time, the balance is being changed in the opposite direction by growth of the French-speaking population and decrease of the German-speaking population.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Language skills are unevenly distributed both over the geographical area of Europe and over sociodemographic groups. Reasonably good language competences are perceived in relatively small member states with several state languages, lesser used native languages or "[[language exchange]]" with neighbouring countries. This is the case in Luxembourg, where 92% speak at least two languages. Those who live in southern European countries or countries where one of the major European languages is a state language have a lower likelihood of speaking multiple foreign languages. Only 5% of Turkish, 13% of Irish, 16% of Italians, 17% of Spanish and 18% from the UK speak at least two languages apart from their native language.

==Working languages==

=== European Commission ===
While documents for and communication with citizens are in every official EU language as a right, day-to-day work in the [[European Commission]] is based around its three working languages: English, French, and German.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ec.europa.eu/stages/information/faq_en.htm What are the working languages of the European Commission?]'', europa.eu, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these English and French are used the most often. The use of English vs. French depends a lot on the unit or directorate. Only a few of the Commissioners use a language other than English or French as their working language. German is rarely used as a true working language in the Commission, and German media have called the dominance of English and French a discrimination against German (which is by far the most spoken mother tongue of the EU) and a violation of the regulations pertaining to the EU's working languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article6544187/Warum-Deutsch-in-der-EU-diskriminiert-wird.html|title=Sprache: Warum Deutsch in der EU diskriminiert wird - WELT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Bundestag]] has repeatedly called for German to finally receive an equal position in the EU Commission alongside English and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article210692/EU-Kommission-soll-Deutsch-als-Sprache-nutzen.html|title=EU-Kommission soll Deutsch als Sprache nutzen: - WELT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language situation also disappoints many in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4840160.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Chirac upset by English address | date=24 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kristalina Georgieva]], who is from Bulgaria, gained a round of applause when she told Parliament she would learn French while in the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris |first=Harvey |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ba88c07a-1414-11df-8847-00144feab49a.html |title=French language losing its cachet? Au contraire! |work=Financial Times |date=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament itself translates its proceedings into all official languages, although the actual spoken language of MEPs is sometimes English or French, so that fellow MEPs can understand them better than if they had the delayed translation. Committee meetings also often default to the language most understood by those attending instead of listening to the translation.

=== Court of Justice ===
The working language of the Court of Justice of the European Union is French. The judges deliberate in French, [[pleading]]s and written legal submissions are translated into French, and the judgment is drafted in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sharpston|first=Eleanor V. E. |title=Appendix 5: Written Evidence of Advocate General Sharpston |work=The Workload of the Court of Justice of the European Union |publisher=House of Lords European Union Committee |date=29 March 2011 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldeucom/128/12816.htm |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Advocates-General, by contrast, may work and draft their opinions in any official language, as they do not take part in any deliberations. These opinions are then translated into French for the benefit of the judges and their deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;On the Linguistic Design of Multinational Courts—The French Capture, forthcoming in 14 INT’L J. CONST. L. (2016), MATHILDE COHEN&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Central Bank ===
The working language of the ECB is English.

==Policy==
The European Union's legal powers on legislative acts and other initiatives on language policy are based on the provisions of the [[Treaties of the European Union]]. In the EU, [[language policy]] is the responsibility of member states, and the European Union does not have a common "language policy". Based on the principle of [[subsidiarity]], European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in the member states' language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of the languages of the member states (Article 149.2).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/12002E/htm/C_2002325EN.003301.html#anArt150 Consolidated version of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Articles 149 to 150], ''Official Journal C 321E of 29 December 2006''.

Retrieved 3 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The rules governing the languages of the institutions of the Community shall, without prejudice to the provisions contained in the Statute of the Court of Justice, be determined by the Council, acting unanimously (Article 290). All languages, in which{{Fix|text=word missing?}} was originally drawn up or was translated due to enlargement, are legally equally authentic. Every citizen of the Union may write to any of the EU institutions or bodies in one of these languages and receive an answer in the same language (Article 314).

In the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights]], legally binding since its inclusion in the [[Lisbon Treaty]], the EU declares that it respects linguistic diversity (Article 22) and prohibits discrimination on grounds of language (Article 21). Respect for linguistic diversity is a fundamental value of the European Union, in the same way as respect for the person, openness towards other cultures, and tolerance and acceptance of other people.

===Initiatives===
[[File:EP Translation booths.jpg|thumb|Interpretation booths in the debating chamber of the [[European Parliament]] ([[Brussels]]).]]

Beginning with the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Lingua programme|fr|3=Lingua (Union européenne)}}'' in 1990, the European Union invests more than €30 million a year (out of a €120 billion [[European Union Budget|EU budget]]) promoting language learning through the ''[[Socrates programme|Socrates]]'' and ''[[Leonardo da Vinci programme|Leonardo da Vinci]]'' programmes in bursaries to enable language teachers to be trained abroad, placing foreign language assistants in schools, funding class exchanges to motivate pupils to learn languages, creating new language courses on CDs and the Internet, and projects that raise awareness of the benefits of language learning.

Through strategic studies, the Commission promotes debate, innovation, and the exchange of good practice. In addition, the mainstream actions of Community programmes which encourage mobility and transnational partnerships motivate participants to learn languages.

[[Youth exchange]]s, [[town twinning]] projects, and the [[European Voluntary Service]] also promote multilingualism. Since 1997, the [[Culture 2000|Culture 2000 programme]] has financed the translation of around 2,000 literary works from and into European languages.

The new programmes proposed for implementation for the [[financial perspective]] 2007–2013 ([[Culture 2007]], [[Youth in Action]], and [[EU Integrated programme|Lifelong Learning]]) will continue and develop this kind of support.

The EU used to provide the main financial support to the [[European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages]] until 2010, a non-governmental organisation which represents the interests of the over 40 million citizens who belong to a regional and minority language community, and for the [[Mercator network|Mercator]] networks of universities active in research on lesser-used languages in Europe. Following a request from the European Parliament, the Commission in 2004 launched a feasibility study on the possible creation of a new [[Agencies of the European Union|EU agency]], the "European Agency for Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity." The study concludes that there are unmet needs in this field, and proposes two options: creating an agency or setting up a European network of "Language Diversity Centres." The Commission believes that a network would be the most appropriate next step and, where possible, should build on existing structures; it will examine the possibility of financing it on a multi-annual basis through the proposed Lifelong Learning programme. Another interesting step would be to translate important public websites, such as the one of the European Central Bank, or Frontex web site also, in at least one other language than English or French.

Although not an EU treaty, most EU member states have ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=148&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG |title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages CETS No.: 148 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To encourage language learning, the EU supported the [[Council of Europe]] initiatives for [[European Year of Languages|European Year of Languages 2001]] and the annual celebration of [[European Day of Languages]] on 26 September.

To encourage the member states to cooperate and to disseminate best practice the Commission issued a Communication on 24 July 2003, on Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity: an Action Plan 2004 – 2006 and a Communication on 22 November 2005, on A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism.

From 22 November 2004, the [[European Commissioner for Education and Culture]] portfolio included an explicit reference to languages and became [[European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism]] with [[Ján Figeľ]] at the post. From 2007 until 2010, the European Commission had a special portfolio on languages, [[European Commissioner for Multilingualism]]. The post was held by [[Leonard Orban]]. Since 2010, the portfolio was merged with education and culture, again.

EU devotes a specialised subsite of its "Europa" portal to languages, the EUROPA Languages portal.

The idea of language as a 'system' appears in the linguistic theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[J.R. Firth]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], and [[Michael Halliday]].

The paradigmatic principle - the idea that the process of using language involves choosing from a specifiable set of options - was established in semiotics by Saussure, whose concept of value (viz. “valeur”), and of signs as terms in a system, “showed up paradigmatic organization as the most abstract dimension of meaning” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

=='System' in systemic functional linguistics==
“System” is used in two related ways in [[systemic functional linguistics]] (SFL). SFL uses the idea of system to refer to language as a whole, (e.g. “the system of language”). This usage derives from [[Louis Hjelmslev|Hjelmslev]] &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, [[Jay Lemke]] describes language as an open, dynamic system.

There is also the notion of “system” as used by [[John Rupert Firth|J.R. Firth]], where linguistic systems are considered to furnish the background for elements of structure.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J.R. 1968. Selected Papers of J.R. Firth 1952-1959. London: Longman. p183.&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that, unlike system in the sense in which it was used by Firth was a conception only found in Firth’s linguistic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Systemic Background. In "Systemic Perspectives on Discourse, Vol. 1: Selected Theoretical Papers" from the ''Ninth International Systemic Workshop'', James D. Benson and William S. Greaves (eds). Ablex. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in ''The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this use of the term “system”, grammatical, or other features of language, are considered best understood when described as sets of options. Thus, “the most abstract categories of the grammatical description are the systems together with their options (systemic features). A systemic grammar differs from other functional grammars (and from all formal grammars) in that it is paradigmatic: a system is paradigmatic set of alternative features, of which one must be chosen if the entry condition is satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1992. Systemic Grammar and the Concept of a “Science of Language”. In Waiguoyu (Journal of Foreign Languages), No. 2 (General Series No. 78), pp1-9. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in ''The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum. p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Halliday’s early work, “system” was considered to be one of four fundamental categories for the theory of grammar, the others being unit, structure and class. The category of ‘system’ was invoked to account for “the occurency of one rather than another from among a number of like events” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp241-92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p 52&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Halliday defined grammar as “that level of linguistic form at which operate closed systems” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp241-92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p 40&lt;/ref&gt; 

In adopting a system perspective on language, systemic functional linguistics can be seen as part of a more general 20th and 21st century reaction against atomistic approaches to science, in which an essence is sought after within smaller and smaller components of the phenomenon under study. In systems thinking, any delineated object of study is defined by its relations to other units postulated by the theory. In systemic functional linguistics, this has been described as the trinocular perspective. Thus a descriptive category must be defended from three perspectives: from above (‘what does it construe?’ ‘what effect does it have in a context of use?’), below (‘how is this function realized?’) and round about (‘what else is in the neighbourhood?’ ‘what other things does this thing have to interact with?’). This gives systemic functional linguistics an affinity with studies of [[complex systems]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9685">"'''Logocentrism'''" is a term coined by the German philosopher [[Ludwig Klages]] in the 1920s. It refers to the tradition of Western science and philosophy that regards words and language as a fundamental expression of an external reality. It holds the [[logos]] as epistemologically superior and that there is an original, irreducible object which the logos represents. It, therefore, holds that one's presence in the world is necessarily mediated. According to logocentrism, the logos is the ideal representation of the [[Platonic ideal]].

== Logocentrism in linguistics ==
With the logos as the site of a representational unity, linguistics dissects the structure of the logos further and establishes the sound of the word, coupled with the sense of the word, as the original and ideal location of metaphysical significance. Logocentric linguistics proposes that "the immediate and privileged unity which founds significance and the acts of language is the articulated unity of sound and sense within the phonic."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; As the science of language, linguistics is a science by way of this semiotic phonology. It follows, therefore, that speech is the primary form of language and that writing is secondary, representative, and, importantly, outside of speech. Writing is a "sign of a sign"&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; and, therefore, is basically phonetic.

Jonathan Culler in his book ''Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction'' says:

:Traditionally, Western philosophy has distinguished "reality" from "appearance," things themselves from representations of them, and thought from signs that express it. Signs or representations, in this view, are but a way to get at reality, truth, or ideas, and they should be as transparent as possible; they should not get in the way, should not affect or infect the thought or truth they represent. In this framework, speech has seemed the immediate manifestation or presence of thought, while writing, which operates in the absence of the speaker, has been treated as an artificial and derivative representation of speech, a potentially misleading sign of a sign.(p. 11)

This notion that the written word is a sign of a sign has a long history in Western thought. According to [[Aristotle]] (384BC-322BC), "Spoken words are the symbols of mental experience and written words are the symbols of spoken words."&lt;ref&gt;(Derrida, p. 30)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] similarly states, "Writing is nothing but the representation of speech; it is bizarre that one gives more care to the determining of the image than to the object."&lt;ref&gt;(Derrida, p. 27)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logocentrism and Saussure ==
[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) follows this logocentric line of thought in the development of his linguistic sign and its terminology. Where the word remains known as the whole sign, the unification of concept and sound-image becomes the unification of the signified and the signifier respectively.&lt;ref&gt;(Derrida, p. 31)&lt;/ref&gt; The signifier is then composed of an indivisible sound and image whereby the graphic form of the sign is exterior.

According to Saussure in his ''Course in General Linguistics'', "The linguistic object is not defined by the combination of the written word and the spoken word: the spoken form alone constitutes the object."&lt;ref&gt;(Derrida, p. 31)&lt;/ref&gt; Language has, he writes, "an oral tradition that is independent of writing."&lt;ref&gt;(Derrida, p. 30)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logocentrism and Derrida ==
French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] (1930–2004) in his book ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' responds in depth to what he believes is Saussure's logocentric argument. Derrida deconstructs the apparent inner, phonological system of language, stating in Chapter 2, ''Linguistics and Grammatology'', that in fact and for reasons of essence Saussure's representative determination is "...an ideal explicitly directing a functioning which...is never completely phonetic".&lt;ref&gt;(Derrida, p. 30)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that writing might function other than phonetically and also as more than merely a representative delineation of speech allows an absolute concept of logos to end in what Derrida describes as infinitist metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;(Derrida, p. 71)&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in presence can never actually be reduced, as was the logocentric project; instead, the chain of signification becomes the trace of presence-absence.&lt;ref&gt;(Derrida, p. 71)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|That the signified is originarily and essentially (and not only for a finite and created spirit) trace, that it is always already in the position of the signifier, is the apparently innocent proposition within which the metaphysics of the logos, of presence and consciousness, must reflect upon writing as its death and its resource.&lt;ref&gt;(Derrida, p. 73)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Logocentrism in literary theory ==
Inherent in Saussure’s reasoning, a [[Structuralism|structuralist]] approach to literature began in the 1950s &lt;ref&gt;(Barry, p. 38)&lt;/ref&gt; to assess the literary text, or utterance, in terms of its adherence to certain organising conventions which might establish its objective meaning. Again, as for Saussure, structuralism in literary theory is condemned to fail on account of its own foundation: ‘...language constitutes our world, it doesn’t just record it or label it. Meaning is always attributed to the object or idea by the human mind, and constructed by and expressed through language: it is not already contained within the thing’.&lt;ref&gt;(Barry, p. 42)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 
There is, therefore, no absolute truth outside of construction no matter how scientific or prolific that construction might be. Enter Derrida and [[post-structuralism]]. Other like-minded philosophers and psychoanalysts in the vein of post-structuralism include [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]] and [[Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;(Barry, p. 64)&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary critic [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–1980), with his essay ''The Death of the Author'' (1968), converted from structuralism to post-structuralism.

For the post-structuralist the writer must be present in a kind of absence, or ‘dead’, according to Barthes; just as the reader is absent in a kind of presence at the ‘moment’ of the literary utterance. Post-structuralism is therefore against the moral formalism of the Western literary tradition which maintains only The Greats should be looked to for literary inspiration and indeed for a means of political control and social equilibrium.

Modernism, with its desire to regain some kind of lost presence, also resists post-structuralist thought; whereas Post-modernism accepts the loss (the loss of being as ‘presence’) and steps beyond the limitations of logocentrism.

== Logocentrism in non-Western cultures ==
Some researchers consider that logocentrism may not be something which exists across all cultures, but instead has a particular bias in Western culture. Tedlock’s study of stories in the Quiché Maya culture&lt;ref&gt;(Tedlock)&lt;/ref&gt; leads him to suggest that the development of alphabetic writing systems may have led to a logocentric perspective, but this is not the case in all writing systems, and particularly less prevalent in cultures where writing has not been established. Tedlock writes, “The voice is linear, in [Derrida’s] view; there is only one thing happening at a time, a sequence of phonemes,”&lt;ref&gt;(Tedlock, p. 322)&lt;/ref&gt; and this is reflected in writing and even the study of language in the field of linguistics and what Tedlock calls “mythologics (or larger-scale structuralism)”,&lt;ref&gt;(Tedlock, p. 323)&lt;/ref&gt; “are founded not upon a multidimensional apprehension of the multidimensional voice, but upon unilinear writing of the smallest-scale articulations within the voice.”&lt;ref&gt;(Tedlock, p. 323)&lt;/ref&gt; This one dimensionality of writing means that only words can be represented through alphabetic writing, and, more often than not, tone, voice, accent and style are difficult if not impossible to represent. Geaney,&lt;ref&gt;(Geaney)&lt;/ref&gt; in writing about ming (names) in early Chinese reveals that ideographic writing systems present some difficulty for the idea of logocentrism, and that even Derrida wrote of Chinese writing in an ambivalent way, assuming firstly that “writing has a historical telos in which phonetic writing is the normal ‘outcome’”,&lt;ref&gt;(Geaney, p. 251)&lt;/ref&gt; but also “speculat[ing] without irony about Chinese writing as a ‘movement of civilization outside all logocentrism’”.&lt;ref&gt;(Geaney, p. 251)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Loxian''' is a [[fictional language|fictional]] [[artistic language]] and alphabet created by Irish poet and lyricist [[Roma Ryan]]. A longtime recording and business partner of Irish singer-songwriter and musician [[Enya]], she created the language during the production of the latter's sixth studio album, ''[[Amarantine (album)|Amarantine]]'' (2005).

== Development ==
During the recording of "Water Shows the Hidden Heart", a track on ''Amarantine'', Enya had sung its lyrics in English, Gaelic and Latin but found none was suitable in getting the message of the song across in a way that they were happy with. Ryan then wrote the first expression in Loxian, pronounced in English as "Syoombraya". After Enya sang it and was pleased with it, Ryan developed the language further and used it for two other tracks on ''Amarantine''—"Less Than a Pearl" and "The River Sings". In the liner notes to the 2009 compilation album ''[[The Very Best of Enya]]'', "It has been a truly unique journey ... We have journeyed from [[Aldebaran]], the track that tells of the future migration of the Celts through space, to the three Loxian songs of ''Amarantine'', which were born of Aldebaran". Enya recorded "Aldebaran" and released it on her 1987 debut album, ''[[Enya (album)|Enya]]''.

The name "Loxian" was taken from the epithet of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god [[Apollo]], the god of prophecy, truth, the sun, among others. As Ryan wrote: "A God of the sun whose name we have given to those who travel to the moon. It is a subtle irony. So, too, is the language of the Loxians, whose words we have woven into these songs, yet those very words belong to a future migration travelling beyond Aldebaran." Ryan used this particular name to link the history of this future generation of space travellers to us, their ancestors.

Loxian has six basic scripts or alphabets: ''ea'' (the Water Script), ''pirrro'' (the Rain Script also called the Vernal Script), ''luua'' (the Shadow Script of summer), ''essa'' (the Autumnal Scripts of the winds – this particular season of scripts has many forms), ''ju'' (the Winter Script which has two visual alphabets) and ''kan'' (the Moon Script or Archer Script).

The Loxian scripts draw on visual origins. The script used in the booklet for ''Amarantine'' and in Ryan's book ''Water Shows the Hidden Heart'' is the ea script. Ryan has combined two influences in this particular script. She says "The Old English word for water is 'ea' (in Middle English the word came to mean 'river' or 'running water') and the design for the alphabet came from water – the letters are, in fact, the common English alphabet used today. The shapes for this alphabet were created from water. I made the letters from water, which, being a fluid form, metamorphosed into the Loxian alphabet of Ea." All of the remaining scripts are based on visual inspiration. As Ryan says – "Loxian began its life as a series of sounds. It was originally meant for only one song, and was to have no meaning, to be a 'soundscape'. The soundscape was Nicky’s idea. I had difficulty with the idea of having purely sounds in the song, and so began to create a meaning and a history behind them purely for myself. Then, as Enya wanted to use the ‘sounds’ or ‘words’ in two other tracks, Loxian was born. It developed into what I would call an art language. I was trying to create an experience; an expression that portrayed Nicky and Enya’s vision. I was not trying to create a new language, per se. Yet ironically, even now, the Loxian language continues to grow.”

Ryan, however, has said that while creating this ‘new language’ she was also very much aware of the fact that many of the languages of our world were dying. She said “Loxian is purely artistic and, although I have given it a history and culture, its primary function is still artistic. We are losing so many world languages. Language is more than everyday communication, it holds history, customs and information about its people and their way of life. As the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered languages tells us – roughly every two weeks a language dies”. 

Roma Ryan has written a book which explores some of the world of the Loxians and gives some background information on the three Loxian songs. The book ''Water Shows the Hidden Heart'' was released in two formats. The original, issued in 2005, is now out of print. A second publication was released by [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]] in 2006. Each of these publications contains a book of poetry within it; the first contains the ''Amarantine'' poetry, and the latter poetry from "The Way Obsidian Sings".

Ryan also created an interactive, on-line game – The Loxian Games – which also explores the Loxian language and the Loxian world. It takes the form of riddles, quests and ‘treasure hunts’ and again has a strong visual aspect to it. 

The language is used for the second time in song in Enya's 2015 album ''[[Dark Sky Island]]'', on two tracks which follow the 'intergalactic' theme of the title - 'The Forge of The Angels' and 'The Loxian Gate'. The narratives of these songs were said to continue the futuristic narrative Loxian is used for.

A '''motorboat''', '''speedboat,''' or '''powerboat''' is a [[boat]] which is powered by an [[engine]]. Some motorboats are fitted with inboard engines, others have an [[outboard motor]] installed on the rear, containing the [[internal combustion engine]], the [[gear reduction|gearbox]] and the [[propeller]] in one portable unit.

An inboard-outboard contains a hybrid of an and an outboard, where the internal combustion engine is installed inside the boat, and the gearbox and propeller are outside.

There are two configurations of an inboard, V-drive and direct drive.  A direct drive has the powerplant mounted near the middle of the boat with the propeller shaft straight out the back, where a V-drive has the powerplant mounted in the back of the boat facing backwards having the shaft go towards the front of the boat then making a ''V'' towards the rear.  The V-drive has become increasingly popular due to [[wakeboarding]] and [[wakesurfing]].{{cn|date=August 2015}}{{dubious|date=August 2015}}

==History==
===Invention===
[[File:Stuttgart-cannstatt-daimler-boot-neckar-1886.jpg|thumb|Model of the first motor boat constructed by [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] in 1886]]
Although the [[Propeller|screw propeller]] had been added to an engine ([[steam engine]]) as early as the 18th century in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], by [[James Watt]], boats powered by a [[petrol engine]] only came about in the later part of the 19th century with the invention of the [[internal combustion engine]].

The earliest boat to be powered by a petrol engine was tested on the [[Neckar]] River by [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] in 1886, when they tested their new "longcase clock" engine. It had been constructed in the former greenhouse (converted into a workshop) in Daimler's back yard.&lt;ref name=DGS&gt;http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-1303725-1-1303019-1-0-0-0-0-1-11694-614318-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html?TS=1302091862634 Daimler AG homepage on Daimler Gedächtnis Stätte in English&lt;/ref&gt; The first public display took place on the Waldsee in Cannstatt, today a suburb of [[Stuttgart]], at the end of that year.&lt;ref name=Reuss&gt;Reuß, H.-J. ''Automobil und Motorschiff haben dieselben Wurzeln''. In: ''Hansa'', issue 2/2011, p.&amp;nbsp;20–21, Schiffahrts-Verlag Hansa, Hamburg 2011, {{ISSN|0017-7504}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine of this boat had a single [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] of 1 [[horse power]]. Daimler's second launch in 1887 had a second cylinder positioned at an angle of 15 degrees to the first one, and was known as the "V-type".

The first successful motor boat was designed by the [[Priestman Brothers]] in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], England, under the direction of [[William Dent Priestman]]. The company began trials of their first motorboat in 1888.&lt;ref name="sciencemuseum"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Catalogue of the naval and marine engineering collection in the London Science museum|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/science-museum-great-britain/catalogue-of-the-naval-and-marine-engineering-span-classsearchtermspan-cla-hci/page-15-catalogue-of-the-naval-and-marine-engineering-span-classsearchtermspan-cla-hci.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was powered with [[kerosene]] and used an innovative high-tension (high voltage) ignition system. The company was the first to begin large scale production of the motor boat, and by 1890, Priestman's boats were successfully being used for towing goods along canals.&lt;ref name="aau"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lms.aau.ac.id/library/ebook/R_137_99_H%20%282%29/files/res/downloads/download_0436.pdf|title=Motorboat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early pioneer was Mr. J. D. Roots, who in 1891 fitted a launch with an internal combustion engine and operated a [[ferry]] service between [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond]] and [[Wandsworth]] along the [[River Thames]] during the seasons of 1891 and 1892.
&lt;ref name="Redwood"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lesliefield.com/other_history/a_short_history_of_motor_boating.htm|title=A Short History of Motor Boating|author=Bernard B. Redwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eminent inventor [[Frederick William Lanchester]] recognized the potential of the motorboat and over the following 15 years, in collaboration with his brother [[George Lanchester|George]], perfected the modern motorboat, or powerboat. Working in the garden of their home in [[Olton]], [[Warwickshire]], they designed and built a river flat-bottomed launch with an advanced high-revving engine that drove via a stern [[paddle wheel]] in 1893. In 1897, he produced a second engine similar in design to his previous one but running on [[benzene]] at 800 r.p.m. The engine drove a reversible [[propeller]]. An important part of his new engine was the revolutionary [[carburettor]], for mixing the fuel and air correctly. His invention was known as a "wick carburetor", because fuel was drawn into a series of wicks, from where it was vaporized. He patented this invention in 1905.&lt;ref name="Redwood"/&gt;

The [[Daimler Company]] began production of motor boats in 1897 from its manufacturing base in [[Coventry]]. The engines had two cylinders and the explosive charge of [[petroleum]] and air was ignited by compression into a heated [[platinum]] tube. The engine gave about six horse-power. The petrol was fed by [[air pressure]] to a large surface carburettor and also an auxiliary tank which supplied the burners for heating the ignition tubes. Reversal of the propeller was effected by means of two bevel friction wheels which engaged with two larger bevel friction wheels, the intermediate shaft being temporarily disconnected for this purpose. It was not until 1901 that a safer apparatus for igniting the fuel with an electric spark was used in motor boats.&lt;ref name="Redwood"/&gt;

===Expansion===
[[Image:Dorothy Levitt driving the Napier motor yacht 1903.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Dorothy Levitt]] won the first [[Harmsworth Cup]], driving the [[Napier &amp; Son|Napier]] motor yacht in 1903]]
Interest in fast motorboats grew rapidly in the early years of the 20th century. The Marine Motor Association was formed in 1903 as an offshoot of the [[Royal Automobile Club]]. ''[[Motor Boat &amp; Yachting]]'' was the first magazine to address technical developments in the field and was brought out by Temple Press, London from 1904. Large manufacturing companies, including [[Napier &amp; Son]] and [[John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company|Thornycroft]] began producing motorboats.&lt;ref name="aau"/&gt;

The first motorboating competition was established by [[Alfred Harmsworth|Alfred Charles William Harmsworth]] in 1903. The [[Harmsworth Cup]] was envisioned as a contest between nations, rather than between boats or individuals. The boats were originally to be designed and built entirely by residents of the country represented, using materials and units built wholly within that country.&lt;ref name="lesliefield"&gt;[http://www.lesliefield.com/races/1949_harmsworth_trophy_race_of_the_giants.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first competition, held in July 1903, at [[Cork Harbour]] in Ireland, and officiated by the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland and the [[Royal Victoria Yacht Club]], was a very primitive affair, with many boats failing even to start.&lt;ref name="lesliefield"/&gt; The competition was won by [[Dorothy Levitt]] in a Napier launch designed to the specifications of [[Selwyn Edge]]. This motorboat was the first proper motorboat designed for high speed.&lt;ref name="sciencemuseum"/&gt; She set the world's first water speed record when she achieved {{convert|19.3|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in a {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} steel-hulled, 75-horsepower Napier speedboat fitted with a three-blade propeller. As both the owner and entrant of the boat, "S. F. Edge" was engraved on the trophy as the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicoffshore.com/blog/tag/the-marine-motor-association/|title=Where it all began!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hacker Kitty Hawk 1911.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hacker-Craft|John Hacker]]'s 1911 ''Kitty Hawk'' was the fastest boat in the world between 1911 and 1915]]
An article in the ''Cork Constitution'' on 13 July reported "A large number of spectators viewed the first mile from the promenade of the Yacht Club, and at Cork several thousand people collected at both sides of the river to see the finishes."&lt;ref name="Cork 1903"&gt;[http://wn.com/harmsworth_trophy?orderby=relevance&amp;upload_time=today The British International Harmsworth Trophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Field 1"&gt;[http://www.lesliefield.com/other_history/from_rowboats_to_roostertails.htm Hydroplane History, ''From Rowboats to Roostertails&amp;nbsp;– A Brief History of Unlimited Hydroplane Racing'', &amp;#91;1986&amp;#93; by Fred Farley, APBA Unlimited Historian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Field 2"&gt;[http://www.lesliefield.com/personalities/roy_duby_looks_back_25_years.htm Hydroplane History&amp;nbsp;– ''Duby Looks Back 25 Years'' &amp;#91;1987&amp;#93;, One speed record that still stands by Larry Paladino]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fastest Girl on Water"&gt;[http://scarfandgoggles.wordpress.com/tag/dorothy-levitt/ Scarf and Goggles, Dorothy Levitt – The Fastest Girl on Water.

[[France]] won the race in 1904, and the boat ''Napier II'' set a new world [[water speed record]] for a mile at almost 30 [[knot (unit)|knot]]s (56&amp;nbsp;km/h), winning the race in 1905.

The acknowledged genius of motor boat design in America, was the naval architect [[Hacker-Craft|John L. Hacker]]. His pioneering work, including the invention of the V-hull and the use of dedicated petrol engines revolutionized boat design from as early as 1908, when he founded the [[Hacker-Craft|Hacker Boat Co]]. In 1911, Hacker designed the ''Kitty Hawk'', the first successful step [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]] which exceeded the then-unthinkable speed of {{convert|50|mph|abbr=on}} and was at that time the fastest boat in the world. The Harmsworth Cup was first won by Americans in 1907.&lt;ref name="lesliefield"/&gt; The US and England traded it back and forth until 1920. From 1920-1933, Americans had an unbroken winning streak. [[Garfield Wood|Gar Wood]] won this race eight times as a driver and nine times as an owner between 1920 and 1933.

A motorboat has one engine or more that propel the vessel over the top of the water. Boat engines vary in shape, size and type. Engines are installed either inboard or outboard. Inboard engines are part of the boat construction, while outboatboard engines are secured to the transom and hangs off the back of the boat. Motorboat engines run on gasoline or diesel fuel. Engines come in various types. Engines vary in fuel type such as: gasoline, diesel, gas turbine, rotary combustion or steam. Motorboats are commonly used for recreation or racing. Boat racing is a sport where drivers and engineers compete for fastest boat. The American Powerboat Association (APBA) splits the sport into categories. The categories include: inboard, inboard endurance, professional outboard, stock outboard, unlimited outboard performance craft, drag, modified outboard and offshore. Engines and hulls categorize racing. The two types of hull shape are runabout and hydroplane. Runabout is a v-shape and hydroplane is flat and stepped.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagnalls|first=|date=2017|title=Motorboat Racing|url=|journal=World Book|volume=|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of hull used depends on the type of water the boat is in and how the boat is being used. Hulls can be made of wood, fiberglass or metal but most hulls today are fiberglass.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Powerboats|last=West|first=James|publisher=International Marine Publishing Company|year=1975|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High performance speedboats can reach speeds of over 50 knots.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Boat International|last=Lardy|first=Kate|date=2018|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their high speed and performance can be attributed to their hull technology and powerful engine. With a more powerful and heavier engine, an appropriate hull shape is needed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annati|first=Massimo|date=2007|title=When Speed Matters|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=34666427-0be9-4ae4-afec-0f34cf2218e8%40sessionmgr4007|journal=Military Technology|volume=2007|pages=123-130|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; High performance boats include yachts, HSIC (high speed interceptor craft) and racing powerboats.

A V-type hull helps a boat cut through the water. A deep V-hull helps keep the boat’s bow down at low speeds, improving visibility. V-hulls also improve a boat’s speed and maneuvering capabilities. They stabilize a boat in rough conditions.

== Hull Type  ==
The type of hull depends on the usage and type of water that the boat is being used in. Types of hulls include displacement hulls, vee-bottom hulls, modified vee-bottom hulls, deep-vee hulls and trim tabs for vee-bottom hulls. Hulls can be made of different materials. The three main materials are wood, reinforced fiberglass and metal. Wood hulls may be made of planks or plywood. Fiberglass hulls are reinforced with balsa wood. Metal hulls are either aluminum or steel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Racing  ==
Powerboat racing engine categories for inboard and outboard engines range from 7.5 cu in to 60 cu in. Categories range from 44 cu in to 450 cu in for inboard only. The two types of motorboat races are speed races and predicted-log race. Speed races involve boats with powerful engines competing for quickest time and take place on freshwater bodies of water on a closed course. Races are marked by buoys. For unlimited hydroplanes the race distance ranges from 5 miles to 30 miles. Hydroplanes are drag raced. Predicted-log races involve slow cabin cruisers. Predicted-log races is a competition of planning and carrying out a sea voyage. The contestants evaluate different factors and variables that they will encounter along the way. The contestant with the least error at the end of the race is the winner. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Motorsailers  ==
Some motorboats are also sailboats. Motorsailers are adaptable and can both sail and motor in all conditions. They tend to be inefficient in certain conditions where either a sail-only or motor-only boat would be ideal. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motorsailers|last=Pike|first=David|publisher=Stanford Maritime Limited|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military Application  ==
A fast craft is a vessel capable of speeds over 30 knots. HSICs (High Speed Interceptor Craft) however, trump fast craft with speeds of over 50 knots. HSICs are usually either custom or law enforcement craft. Law enforcement use these extremely fast boats to catch criminals such as smugglers or drug traffickers who use fast craft as well. The military have started to use HSICs to stop international threats such as pirates, militias, terrorists and weapons traffickers. Originally HSICs were not meant to carry large weapons. Now that the military is using them, they are being built with heavy machine guns. The boats have to be fitted with robust weight control and at the same time have heavy amour. HSICs must do without propellers to account for cavitation and vibrations.  Instead HSICs use surface drivers or water jets.

'''''Positions''''' is a 1972 book by the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]].

==Summary==
''Positions'' consists of a collection of interviews. Derrida talks about his earlier works and their relationships. He said that his 1962 essay, ''[[Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction]]'', already contained many elements of his thought, that would be further elaborated. He added: "that essay can be read as the other side (recto or verso, as you wish) of ''[[Speech and Phenomena]]''."&lt;ref&gt;''Positions'' (1981), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the relationship between his three foundational works of 1967, Derrida explained: " ''Speech and Phenomena'' is perhaps the essay which I like most. Doubtless I could have bound it as a long note to one or the other of the other two works. ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' refers to it and economizes its development. But in a classical philosophical architecture, ''Speech...'' would come first: in it is posed, at a point which appears juridically decisive for reasons that I cannot explain here, the question of the privilege of the voice and of phonetic writing in their relationship to the entire history of the West, such as this history can be represented by the history of metaphysics and metaphysics in its most modern, critical and vigilant form: [[Husserl]]'s transcendental phenomenology."&lt;ref&gt;''Positions'' (1981), pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1425">'''Richard Jones''' (1603 &amp;ndash; 1655 or 1656) was a Welsh [[Church of England|Anglican]] priest and writer.

==Life==
Jones, from north Wales, was educated at [[Jesus College, Oxford]] where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in 1626 and his [[MA Oxon|MA]] in 1628.  He was ordained as an [[Church of England|Anglican]] priest and became [[vicar]] of [[Llanfair Caereinion]], [[Montgomeryshire]], Wales in 1636.  In 1650, during the [[English Commonwealth]], he was deprived of this position by the Council for the Propagation of the Gospel in Wales, although he continued to work in the parish.  He also published two summaries of the Bible in free metric form: ''{{lang|cy|Testun Testament Newydd ein Harglwydd … yn Benhillion Cymraeg}}'' (1653) and ''{{lang|cy|Perl y Cymro neu Cofiadur y Beibl ar fesurau Psalmau Dafydd}}'' (1655).

'''''Salamander Syncope''''' (1971) 24-minute work directed and produced by [[Hamid Naficy]] on 2-inch, color videotape and 16mm film for his [[Master of Fine Arts]] thesis at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. Naficy produced the work in conjunction with the UCLA computer department. He collaborated over two years with six computer engineering students including [[internet pioneer]] [[Vint Cerf]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Askari|first1=Kaveh|title=Through Thick and Thin: An interview with Hamid Naficy|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.cmstudies.org/resource/resmgr/fieldnotes/Transcription_Naficy.pdf|website=Society for Cinema and Media Studies|publisher=Society for Cinema and Media Studies|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long ignored in scholarly circles, the film has begun to be discussed as an early example of computer-generated cinema, specifically experimental and countercultural cinema produced in the United States by an Iranian immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dig This!

==Influences==
The imagery in the film is abstract, generated by computers and subsequently manipulated with additional computers and video processing tools. It is thematically indebted to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1968 [[2001: A Space Odyssey]], with imagery such as the origin of modern humans and the development to the transcendent "Star Child" evoked through abstract computer-generated imagery. Naficy sought to represent "inner and outer consciousness." Naficy was also influenced the writings and ideas of [[Alan Watts]], [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Gene Youngblood]], and [[Buckminster Fuller]]. In terms of contemporary experimental film and video, Naficy was only familiar with some of [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney's]] films at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friel|first1=Patrick|title=Crucial Viewing: :: Friday, February 2 – Thursday, February 8 ::|url=http://www.cinefile.info/cine-list/2018/2/1/2818|website=Cine-File|publisher=Cine-File|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
Fellow UCLA student Ken Yapkowitz's [[quadraphonic]] score combines the use of [[Moog synthesizers]] and recordings of Muslim preachers recorded at Naficy's uncle's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salamander Syncope|url=https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/salamander-syncope|website=Scholars at Northwestern|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13215">The term “School Brand”, similar to "brand" as it applies to traditional business applications, is any type of term, mark or insignia, which identifies one organization or product from another. These marks were intended to indicate an affiliation with a particular school, group, organization, trade, manufacturer, or maker.

== History ==

While “branding” has history as far back as 1100&amp;nbsp;BCE, in a period referred to as the [[Vedic Period]], “School Branding” however is a relatively new concept. Many universities and colleges, now operate in a businesslike market where students are “customers” and other schools are competition. To successfully compete, a school must develop and market its own brand that differentiates it from the thousands of other schools vying for students and funding. Although most have marketing budgets, schools are still climbing the learning curve when relating to effective branding.

According to Branding Strategy Insider, school branding surfaced in the early 1800s when a few sororities and fraternities literally branded their pledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2006/08/history_of_bran.html/ |title=History of Branding - Brand Strategy Insider |publisher=Brandingstrategyinsider.com |date=2006-08-14 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, tobacco and patent medicine companies began branding their products as a way to identify them and build buyer loyalty. Brand identity also helped protect the customer by holding companies more accountable for product quality. By the mid-1800s, branding became central to business strategy as consumer companies such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] began using it in their marketing.

Higher education waited over a century to follow the corporate world. According to University Business, schools adopted branding in the early 2000s, when they realized that higher learning had evolved into a marketplace of customers and providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitybusiness.com/article/have-college-brands-delivered-their-promise|title=Have College Brands Delivered on Their Promise?|author=Robert A. Sevier|publisher=UB University Business|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of for-profit and online universities created more choices for students, and those newer schools were aggressively marketing in corporate style. Students were becoming more diverse, and schools could no longer take demographics for granted. At the same time, schools ranging from elementary to colleges and universities, had to compete harder for government funding and private endowments. To meet the challenges, universities invested in market research, logos and other marketing efforts that often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

== Present situation ==

Today’s school branding goes a step further and identifies a school’s unique competitive advantage. As stated in the Gallup Business Journal, a brand promises what the student experience will be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessjournal.gallup.com/content/28081/building-brand-higher-education.aspx/ |title=Building Brand Higher Education - Gallup Business Journal |publisher=Businessjournal.gallup.com |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many school departments produce their own distinctive communications, which can muddy the message. Colleges are grappling with the fact that the message is only effective if the entire faculty and leadership commit as one voice to the brand promise.

Schools also need to communicate their brand in a way that resonates emotionally with students. When people feel a message, they are more likely to remember it and respond. Brandgarten advocates using archetypes in branding to focus the emotional message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandgarten.com/2012/05/07/branding-higher-education|title=Branding Higher Education|publisher=brandgarden|date=May 5, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a school that places a high value on community service might use the archetype of the caregiver to tell its story. Prospective students would hear the call to service in all of the college's communications and could decide whether it was a potential match. Prior to branding, the same college would have been lost among superficially similar schools.

One recent rebranding occurred when [[Beaver College]], in Pennsylvania, surveyed prospective students and discovered that 30 percent of people considering the university did not apply because of the name. As a result, Beaver College was rebranded as [[Arcadia University]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunzel|first1=David|title=Universities Sell Their Brands|journal=The Journal of Product and Brand Management|date=2007|volume=16 |issue=2|pages=152-153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition of need ==

[[Harvard University]], viewed as the college gold standard, relies on branding to help recruit students and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randall |first=Kevin |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1361340/does-branding-pay-colleges-harvard-thinks-so/ |title=Does Branding Pay Off for Colleges? Harvard Thinks So |publisher=Fast Company |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university took a lesson from its own business school and has applied for trademarks to protect several taglines. According to Fast Company, Harvard has already won approval for the taglines "Ask what you can do" and "Lessons learned". Harvard has also taken the entrepreneurial step of licensing its name to an upscale clothing line, which helps with branding as well as its funding mission.

Although colleges may be fairly new to branding, Neuromarketing points out that they represent the longest-lived brands in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fri, Jul 17, 2009 Neuromarketing, Branding |url=http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/college-branding.htm/ |title=College Branding |publisher= Neuromarketing |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools exist for decades and even centuries and today have thousands of rivals. As baby boomers age out of the education market, the declining number of prospective students is increasing competition among schools. Schools have responded with glossy marketing campaigns but still lag in branding. Neuromarketing notes that much college marketing material portrays similar images of a pleasant campus filled with smiling professors and a diverse student body. Websites, brochures and even tours often leave students and their families no wiser as to what makes a particular school special.

The missing ingredient is brand development, as [[Columbia University]] discovered in recent years. According to Neuromarketing, Columbia branded itself as the only Ivy League school in New York City and began showcasing the Manhattan experience in its marketing materials. Student applications have since increased over the competition, and many applicants cited location as the reason they chose Columbia University. Administrators of Columbia University realized that name recognition alone was not enough to attract more of the right students, and its branding strategy paid off.

Even as schools compete for students, those students are learning to brand themselves in an effort to impress colleges. High school is the right time to start building a personal brand, advises Visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vizibility.net/blog/its-never-too-early-personal-branding-for-high-school-college-students/ |title=It’s Never Too Early - Personal Branding for High School &amp; College Students - Visibility |author=Adrian Maynard| publisher=Vizibility.net |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young students can take several steps to enhance their uniqueness, beginning with defining a niche that will serve as the core of their brand. To build the school brand, they can start a quality blog and network both online and offline about its subject. Additional help in for schools in building a brand can be found by extended resources to companies like VIP Branding, who specializes in school branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalvillageconcerns.com/ |title=Specializing in School Branding - VIP Branding |publisher=Globalvillageconcerns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allocation of resources to expert branding companies, allows school administrators to focus their attention to the needs of the school. By the time these students are ready to apply for college, they will have an edge over those who left personal branding up to the admissions essay.

Today’s students shop with brand awareness, and schools need to have a compelling message in place to attract them. Online school stores, like the ones offered through the Varsity Shop Program, provide a new avenue for schools to market themselves and their brand, through specialty designed and branded products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsityshop.com/ |title=Varsity Shop Program |publisher=varsityshop.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although schools tends to be leery of corporate tactics, branding is an opportunity for them to define for themselves what makes them special. By doing so, schools enrich what they offer creating school spirit and student pride, helping students to carry that commitment and care onto higher education.

== Repercussions of improper use ==

While many school administrators, recognize the power of school branding, the lack of resources and funding have led to alternative solutions to professional branding. Logo infringement has increased through the years as a result of this acknowledged need for branding. Numerous schools across the United States are infringing upon trademarked logos without realizing they are in violation. The [[Sanford Herald]] notated a recent case with [[Lake Mary High School]] out of [[Florida]], was in such a case, when the school was given a cease and desist order to terminate the use of their ram logo because as their ram logo was too similar the [[Dodge Ram]] logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mysanfordherald.com/view/full_story_obits/7668253/article-Lake-Mary-rallies-around-new-ram|title=Lake Mary rallies around a new ram|author=Rachel Delinski|publisher=The Sanford Herold|date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, logo infringement is accidental, but the resulting repercussions of using trademarked logos can lead to litigation, exorbitant fines, and can be disparaging on school morale.

In addition to logo infringement, the loss of brand identity is another resulting drawback to improper school branding. Unprofessionally designed logos or mascots, can lead to an undesired identity or a variety of versions, which can lead to brand confusion as notated in by Brand Empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandempowerment.com/schools/school-challenges/brand-control/ |title=Brand Control |publisher=Brand Empowerment |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:gesture raised fist with thumb and pinky lifted.jpg|thumb|right|The "shaka" sign is a common greeting in the Hawaiian culture, subsequently also used in surfer culture.]]
The '''shaka sign''', sometimes known as "hang loose," is a gesture of friendly intent often associated with [[Hawaii]], and [[surf culture]]. It consists of extending the thumb and smallest finger while holding the three middle fingers curled, and gesturing in salutation while presenting the front or back of the hand; the hand may be rotated back and forth for emphasis. The shaka sign was adopted from local Hawaiian culture and customs{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} by visiting surfers in the 1960s, and its use has spread around the world. It is primarily used as a greeting gesture or one to express thanks, acknowledgement, or even praise from one individual to another.

== Meaning and use ==
Residents of [[Hawaii]] use the shaka to convey the "[[Aloha]] Spirit", a concept of friendship, understanding, compassion, and solidarity among the various ethnic cultures that reside in [[Hawaii]], lacking a direct semantic to literal translation. The shaka can also be used to express "howzit?", "thanks, eh?", and "all right!". Drivers will often use it on the road to communicate distant greetings and gratitude.

In California, the shaka sign may be referred to as "hang loose" or "[[Hang Ten|hang ten]]", both associated with surfer culture.&lt;ref name=Geal /&gt;

The gesture enjoys common use in American [[hang gliding]] culture, for both sentiment and word play, in part due to the simultaneous rise of surfing and hang gliding in California in the 1960s and 1970s. It is also widely used among triathletes, [[skydivers]], base jumpers, [[Wakeboarding|wakeboarders]], scuba divers, paragliders, skateboarders, &amp; speed-flyers .{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Along coastal [[Brazil]], the shaka sign, known as the "hang loose" (also derived from an eponymous clothing brand, which uses the shaka as a logo), is a common gesture; [[Ronaldinho]] usually celebrated the goals he scored by giving the crowd a double shaka. It is also associated with the [[Brazilian jiu jitsu]] community internationally.&lt;ref name=Geal&gt;{{cite web|author=Cam |url= http://caminbrazilandbolivia.blogspot.com/2010/09/brazil-and-i-celebrate-our-two-month.html |title=Cam in South America: Brazil and I celebrate our two-month anniversary: reflections on our relationship |date=2010-09-27 |accessdate= 2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several [[Emoticon]] representations of the shaka sign - '''\,,,/''', '''\m/''', and '''\,,,_'''. The earliest known use of the first two, with three commas or a lower case "m" corresponding to a hand's three middle fingers, is from 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pleiade.org/col_geal/aux_armes-mottoes.html#shaka-sign |title=Aux armes · mottoes: clarere audere gaudere &amp; ζητεῖν τὴν ἀλήθειαν | last=Geal | first=Alan |publisher=Pleiade.org |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate= 2016-07-02| quote= an innocently hedonistic call of American West Coast youth in the 1960's, Surf's up! : \,,,/ or \m/ Hang loose!}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last, similar to the first except that it represents the thumb extended horizontally (as if perpendicular to the wrist) is reported, together with the first form, from [[Brigham Young University]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=BYU /&gt;

===Similar gestures===
The sign can also be used to indicate the imbibing of a bottled drink, as attested to below, by placing the thumb to the mouth and motioning the little finger upward as if tipping up a bottle's bottom end. A similar meaning can be achieved by pressing the thumb up against the tip of the nose with the little finger raised upwards parallel to the bridge of the nose. Referred to as "schooies" (Australian slang for a [[Schooner (glass)|schooner]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schooie |url= http://www.slang-dictionary.org/Schooie |publisher= Slang Dictionary |access-date=25 July 2016 | quote= Australian Slang: schooner of beer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Definition of Schooie |url= http://dictionary.babylon-software.com/schooie/ |publisher= Babylon |access-date=25 July 2016 | quote= Australian Slang: schooner of beer}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sign is thought to have originated in [[Perth]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

With the thumb held near the ear and the little finger pointed at the mouth, the gesture is commonly understood to mean "call me", as it resembles a hand held telephone. The Unicode 9.0 [[emoji]] [[&amp;#x1F919;]] "Call me hand"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U+1F919: CALL ME HAND|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F900.pdf |publisher=unicode.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be mistaken for a shaka sign.

With the fingers facing forward, the same gesture is the letter [[Y]] in the [[American manual alphabet]]. {{See also|ILY sign}}

In China, this [[Chinese number gestures|gesture]] means "6". Often, “6” is used to praise someone who has done well in something as it has the same pronunciation as the word “溜”, which means “smooth”. Therefore, the gesture and the emoji 🤙 are also used as a compliment.

In Australia and Russia raising the thumb to the mouth while pointing the little finger to the air is seen as invitation for one to smoke marijuana, the posture resembling the use of a pipe.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Similarly in New Zealand, this gesture symbolises smoking a [[Methamphetamine|"P" (methamphetamine)]] pipe, as well as variations of the shaka sign being the recognised [[Gang Sign#Hand signs|gang salute]] for the [[Mongrel Mob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/28248/patch-colours-and-salute | first1= Greg | last1=Newbold| first2=Rāwiri| last2=Taonui| title=Gangs &amp;ndash; Māori gangs and Pacific youth gangs| encyclopedia=Te Ara &amp;ndash; The Encyclopedia of New Zealand| date= 2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, fans of the Mormon-sponsored [[Brigham Young University]] (also known colloquially as "The Y") have started using the gesture, in deference to newly hired [[Kalani Sitake]], BYU's Polynesian head football coach, and because of its similarity with the letter Y in the [[American manual alphabet]] that is used with American Sign Language. Perhaps most importantly there, it is used as a nod of respect to Hamana Kalili, a native Hawaiian Mormon who according to locals is the founder of the popular sign.&lt;ref name=BYU&gt;{{Cite magazine|url= https://magazine.byu.edu/article/handy-way-rep-y/ |title=World-Famous Shaka Started By Hawaiian Latter-day Saint |access-date= 2016-08-10 |first= Michael R. | last= Walker | date= Summer 2016 |work= [[BYU Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory relates the origin of the shaka to the Spanish immigrants, who folded their middle fingers and took their thumbs to their lips as a friendly gesture to represent sharing a drink with the natives they met in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.to-hawaii.com/shaka.php |title=Hawaii's shaka symbol |publisher=To-Hawaii.com |accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 September 2005 |title=Theorizing about birth of shaka |author=Bob Krauss |newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2005/Sep/25/ln/FP509250345.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://magazine-dev.byu.edu/article/handy-way-rep-y/{{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Origin of the "Shaka" Sign |url=http://www.k12.hi.us/~stevenso/shaka/shaka.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030222082433/http://www.k12.hi.us/~stevenso/shaka/shaka.htm |archivedate=22 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sean Reavis |title=The Shaka- History of the Hawaiian "Hang Loose" |date=18 March 2016 |publisher=Boarders |url=http://boardersmag.com/articles/the-shaka-history-of-the-hawaiian-hang-loose |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325130210/http://boardersmag.com/articles/the-shaka-history-of-the-hawaiian-hang-loose |archivedate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Céline Nguyen |title=SURFIN' USA |publisher=Surf Library |url=http://surflibrary.org/SurfingUSA.html |postscript=.

Yet another theory relates the origin to visiting whalers who signaled a catch with a "tails up" shaka.

Shaka and its very positive associations may simply derive from the popular World War II "V for Victory" hand sign, in Hawaii often held up and rotated rapidly back and forth, "shaken", hence shaka.

The late Lippy Espinda, a used car salesman and [[Oahu]]-based entertainer, has also been named as a possible creator of the shaka.&lt;ref name="The Funniest People in Hawaii"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.honolulumagazine.com/core/pagetools.php?pageid=6960&amp;url=%2FHonolulu-Magazine%2FNovember-2009%2FThe-Funniest-People-in-Hawaii%2F&amp;mode=print |publisher= Honolulu Magazine |title= The Funniest People in Hawaii |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Theorizing about birth of shaka"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2005/Sep/25/ln/FP509250345.html |work= [[The Honolulu Advertiser]] |title= Theorizing about birth of shaka |accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Espinda, who frequently appeared as an extra in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' as well as ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' episodes shot in Hawaii, used the term and the sign during his television ads in the '60s. Though the claim that he is the originator of the shaka sign is debatable, he is credited with increasing its popularity and of [[Hawaiian Pidgin]] as well.&lt;ref name="Watanabe"/&gt; The shaka has achieved great popularity in [[Australia]], primarily among teenagers on social media sites such as [[Instagram]] and [[Facebook]].

The Oxford English Dictionary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Release notes: Bama and shaka: how two local words went global |author=Katherine Connor Martin, Head of US Dictionaries |date=December 2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/december-2016-update/release-notes-bama-and-shaka-how-two-local-words-went-global/ |access-date=27 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827170144/http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/december-2016-update/release-notes-bama-and-shaka-how-two-local-words-went-global/ |archive-date=27 August 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives this etymology of 'shaka': Origin uncertain; perhaps &lt; Japanese shaka, a byname of the historical Buddha (ultimately &lt; Sanskrit śākyamuni, a byname of the Buddha, probably via Chinese), although if so the relationship with the hand gesture is unclear.

'''Shlomo ben Avraham ibn Aderet''' ({{lang-he-n|שלמה בן אברהם אבן אדרת}} or '''Solomon son of Abraham son of Aderet''')&lt;ref&gt;The name Shlomo ben Avraham ibn Aderet may be written in many different ways. His first name is written as either Shlomo or Solomon. Aderet sometimes is spelled Adret or Adereth. "Ben", a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word, and "ibn" an (the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word both mean "son". Occasionally, the "ben Avraham" is removed, leaving his name as Shlomo ibn Aderet.&lt;/ref&gt; (1235–1310) was a [[medieval]] [[rabbi]], [[Halakha|halakhist]], and [[Talmud]]ist. He is widely known as the '''Rashba''' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|רשב״א}}), the Hebrew [[acronym]] of his title and name: '''Ra'''bbi '''Sh'''lomo '''b'''en '''A'''vraham.

The Rashba was born in [[Barcelona]], [[Crown of Aragon]], in 1235. He became a successful banker and leader of [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spanish Jewry]] of his time. As a rabbinical authority his fame was such that he was designated as El Rab d'España ("The Rabbi of Spain"). He served as rabbi of the [[Ancient synagogue (Barcelona)|Main Synagogue of Barcelona]] for 50 years.  He  died in 1310.

==Biography==
His teachers were [[Nahmanides]] and [[Yonah Gerondi]]. He was a master in the study of the Talmud, and was not opposed to the Cabala. Adret was very active as a rabbi and as an author. Under his auspices and through his recommendation, part of the commentary on the Mishnah by Maimonides was translated from the Arabic into Hebrew. His Talmudic lectures were attended by throngs of disciples, many of whom came from distant places. Questions in great number, dealing with ritual, with the most varied topics of the Halakah, and with religious philosophy, were addressed to him from Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Germany, and even from Asia Minor. His responsa show evidence of wide reading, keen intelligence, and systematic thought. They also afford a clear insight into the communal life of the time, portraying Adret's contemporaries, and are of value for the study not only of rabbinical procedure but also of the intellectual development of the age in which he lived. Only half of these responsa have been published, as they number three thousand.

Among his numerous students were [[Yom Tov Asevilli]] and [[Bahya ben Asher]].

A manuscript purporting to be a certificate of indebtedness, dated 1262, in favor of a certain Solomon Adret, Jew of Barcelona, and a passport for the same Adret, dated 1269, are still extant (Jacobs, "Sources," pp.&amp;nbsp;16, 43, No. 130). 

===Defense of Judaism===
Adret had to contend with the external enemies of Judaism, as well as with religious dissensions and excesses within its own ranks. He wrote a refutation of the charges of [[Raymond Martini]], a Dominican monk of Barcelona, who, in his work, "Pugio Fidei," had collected passages from the Talmud and the Midrash and interpreted them in a manner hostile to Judaism. These charges also induced Adret to write a commentary on the Haggadot, of which only a fragment is now extant. He refuted also the attacks of a [[Islam|Muslim]] who asserted that the priests had falsified the Bible. M. Schreiner ("Z. D. M. G." xlviii, 39) has shown that this Muslim was [[Ibn Hazm|Aḥmad ibn Ḥazm]], and the book referred to was "Al-Milal wal-Niḥal" (Religions and Sects).

Adret opposed also the increasing extravagances of the [[Kabbalists]], who made great headway in Spain and were represented by Nissim ben Abraham of Avila, a pretended worker of miracles, and by [[Abraham Abulafia]], the kabbalistic visionary. He combated these with vigor, but displayed no less animosity toward the philosophic-rationalistic conception of Judaism then prevailing, particularly in France, which was represented by Levi ben Abraham ben Ḥayyim, who treated most important religious questions with the utmost freedom, and who was joined by the Spaniard [[Isaac Albalag]] and others.

===Adret and Abba Mari===
Opposed to these was another tendency, the chief object of which was the preservation of the pure faith of Judaism. At the head of this movement stood [[Abba Mari|Abba Mari ben Moses ha-Yarḥi]]. He appealed to Adret for assistance. An extensive correspondence ensued between the authorities of southern France and northern Spain, Adret taking a most important part. Afterward this correspondence was collected and published by Abba Mari, in a separate work, entitled "Minḥat Ḳenaot".&lt;ref&gt;Published in Presburg, 1838. See full analysis in Renan's "Les Rabbins Français," pp.&amp;nbsp;647–694.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adret, whose disposition was peaceable, at first endeavored to conciliate the opposing spirits. Ultimately he was called upon to decide the affair, and on July 26, 1305, together with his colleagues of the rabbinate of Barcelona, he pronounced the ban of excommunication (ḥerem) over all who studied physics or metaphysics before the completion of their thirtieth year. A protest against this ban may be found in a poem in which Philosophy "calls out in a loud voice against . . . Solomon ben Adret and against all the rabbis of France . . . who have placed under the ban all people who approach her" (see H. Hirschfeld, "Jew. Quart. Rev." xii. 140). Those who desired to study medicine as a profession were exempted from the ban. A special ban was pronounced against the rationalistic Bible exegetes and the philosophic Haggadah commentators, their writings and their adherents. The enforcing of these bans caused Adret much trouble and embittered the closing years of his life. He left three sons, Isaac, Judah, and Astruc Solomon, all of whom were learned in the Talmud.

===The Rashba and Rambam===
The Rashba defended [[Rambam]] (Maimonides) during contemporary debates over his works, and he authorized the translation of Rambam's commentary on the [[Mishnah]] from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] to Hebrew.

Nevertheless, the Rashba was opposed to the [[Rationalism|philosophic-rationalistic]] approach to Judaism often associated with Rambam, and he was part of the ''[[Beth din|beit din]]'' (rabbinical court) in Barcelona that forbade men younger than 25 from studying secular [[philosophy]] or the [[natural sciences]] (although an exception was made for those who studied medicine). On July 26, 1305, the Rashba wrote:

"In that city [Barcelona] are those who write iniquity about the Torah and if there would be a heretic writing books, they should be burnt as if they were the book of sorcerers."&lt;ref&gt;H. Z. Dimitrovsky, ed. ''Teshubot HaRishba'', Vol. 2 (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1990) I, Pt. I, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Of the works of Solomon ben Adret there have appeared in print:
* A manual on [[kashrut]] (dietary laws) and other religious laws that are observed at home, "Torat ha-Bayit ha-Aruk" (The Complete Law of the House), published at Venice in 1607, at Berlin in 1762, at Vienna in 1811, etc.
* The shorter manual, "Torat ha-Bayit ha-Ḳaẓir" (The Short Law of the House), published at Cremona in 1565, and at Berlin in 1871. A number of his commentaries and novellæ on Talmudic treatises have been printed.
* ''Mishmeret HaBayit'', a defense against the [[Ra'ah]]'s critique of ''Torat HaBayit''.
* Commentaries upon seven treatises published at Constantinople in 1720, and at Berlin in 1756. Similar disquisitions upon five treatises were published at Venice in 1523 and at Amsterdam in 1715. He wrote besides a number of disquisitions upon single treatises. His Talmud commentaries are now known as ''Hiddushei HaRashba''.
* ''Sha'ar HaMayim'', a work focusing on the laws of a [[mikvah]] (ritual bath).
* The "Pisḳe Ḥallah" (Decisions on Ḥallah), published at Constantinople in 1518, and at Jerusalem in 1876.
* The "'Abodat ha-Ḳodesh" (The Holy Service), on the laws of Sabbath and festivals, published at Venice in 1602.
* His polemical work against Mohammedanism was edited by Perles, as an appendix to the latter's monograph on Adret.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kayserling|first1=Meyer|title=ADRET, SOLOMON BEN ABRAHAM (or RaSHBa)|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/859-adret-solomon-ben-abraham|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsa===
Aderet was considered an outstanding rabbinic authority, and more than 3,000 of his [[responsa]] are known to be extant. Questions were addressed to him from Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Germany, and even from Asia Minor. His responsa, which cover the entire gamut of Jewish life, are concise and widely quoted by halakhic authorities.

Aderet's responsa also illustrate his opposition to [[messianism]] and prophetic pretensions as a general phenomenon, with examples against [[Jewish Messiah claimants#13th century|Nissim ben Abraham]] and [[Abraham Abulafia]].

His responsa were printed in Bologna (1539), Venice (1545), Hanau (1610), and other places. The second part of his responsa appeared under the title "Toledot Adam" (The Generations of Man) at Leghorn in 1657, the third part at the same place in 1778, the fourth part at Salonica in 1803, and the fifth part at Leghorn in 1825.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5198">'''Shoring''' is the process of temporarily supporting a building, vessel, structure, or trench with shores (props) when in danger of collapse or during repairs or alterations. ''Shoring'' comes from ''shore'' a timber or metal prop.&lt;ref&gt;"shore, n. 3." def, 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Shoring may be vertical, angled, or horizontal.

== Techniques ==
===Buildings===
[[File:Fixing-tilt-slabs.jpg|thumb|right|Single steel raking shore system specifically for tilt slab shoring.]]
'''Raking Shores''' consist of one or more timbers sloping between the face of the structure to be supported and the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Shoring |volume=24 |pages=1004–1007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most effective support is given if the raker meets the wall at an angle of 60 to 70 degrees. A [[wall-plate]] is typically used to increase the area of support.

'''Foundations'''

Shoring is commonly used when installing the foundation of a building. A shoring system such as piles and lagging or shotcrete will support the surrounding loads until the underground levels of the building are constructed.

===Trenches===
[[File:Trench-shoring.png|thumb|right|Schematic sketch of a modern steel trench shore being lowered into a trench.]]
During excavation, shoring systems provide safety for workers in a trench and speeds up excavation. In this case, shoring should not be confused with [[trench shield|shielding]]. Shoring is designed to prevent collapse where shielding is only designed to protect workers when collapses occur.
Concrete-structure and stone-building shoring, in these cases also referred to as [[falsework]], provides temporary support until the concrete becomes hard and achieves the desired strength to support loads.

'''Hydraulic Shoring'''

Hydraulic shoring is the use of hydraulic pistons that can be pumped outward until they press up against the trench walls. They are typically combined with steel plate or plywood, either being 1-1/8" thick plywood, or special heavy Finland Form (FINFORM) 7/8" thick.

'''Beam and Plate'''

Beam and Plate steel I-beams are driven into the ground and steel plates are slid in amongst them. A similar method that uses wood planks is called soldier boarding. Hydraulics tend to be faster and easier; the other methods tend to be used for longer term applications or larger excavations.

'''Soil Nailing'''

Soil nailing is a technique in which soil slopes, excavations or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements - normally steel reinforcing bars. The bars are usually installed into a pre-drilled hole and then grouted into place or drilled and grouted simultaneously. They are usually installed untensioned at a slight downward inclination. A rigid or flexible facing (often sprayed concrete) or isolated soil nail heads may be used at the surface.

===Shoring in Ships===
Shoring is used on board when damage has been caused to a vessel's integrity, and to hold leak-stopping devices in place to reduce or stop incoming water. Generally consists of timber 100&amp;nbsp;mm x 100&amp;nbsp;mm and used in conjunction with wedges, to further jam shoring in place, pad pieces to spread the load and dogs to secure it together. also used on board is mechanical shoring as a quick, temporary solution, however it isn't favoured due to its inability to move with the vessel.

'''Proud'''

This consists of a timber member jammed on a pad piece on either the deck or deck head depending on water levels in the compartment and a strong point, this is called the proud. Then there is a horizontal timber cut to size to fit between this and what it is shoring up, e.g. a splinter box, bulkhead or door. Timber wedges are then used to tighten up the structure if necessary.

'''Vertical Shoring'''
This is to support a hatch or splint box on the deck, consisting of a vertical timber between the deck and deck head, with to wedges used opposing each other to tighten it. pad pieces are used to spread the load on weak structures.

'''Sinkov statistics''', also known as '''log-weight statistics''', is a specialized field of [[statistics]] that was developed by [[Abraham Sinkov]], while working for the small [[Signal Intelligence Service]] organization, the primary mission of which was to compile [[code]]s and [[cipher]]s for use by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. The [[mathematics]] involved include [[modular arithmetic]], a bit of [[number theory]], some [[linear algebra]] of two dimensions with [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], some [[combinatorics]], and a little [[statistics]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elementary-Cryptanalysis-Mathematical-Approach-Library/dp/0883856220 Amazon.com: Elementary Cryptanalysis: A Mathematical Approach &lt;/ref&gt;

Sinkov did not explain the theoretical underpinnings of his statistics, or characterized its [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]], nor did he give a decision procedure for accepting or rejecting candidate [[plaintext]]s on the basis of their S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; scores. The situation becomes more difficult when comparing [[String (computer science)|strings]] of different lengths because Sinkov does not explain how the distribution of his statistics changes with length, especially when applied to higher-order grams. As for how to accept or reject a candidate plaintext, Sinkov simply said to try all possibilities and to pick the one with the highest S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; value. Although the procedure works for some applications, it is inadequate for applications that require on-line decisions. Furthermore, it is desirable to have a meaningful interpretation of the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; values. &lt;ref&gt;[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~bart/decrypter/gs93.pdf Statistical Techniques for Language Recognition: An Introduction and Guide for Cryptanalysts]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Somra''' (after its literary dialect), also known as '''Burmese Tangkhul''' (Tangkhul Naga), is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language spoken in Burma. The two ethnic Tangkhul languages are related, but are not mutually intelligible, being only 30% lexically similar.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; Somra is closer to [[Akyaung Ari language|Akyaung Ari]].

Somra is spoken in Somra tract, [[Leshi Township]] and [[Homalin Township]] of [[Sagaing Division]], Myanmar.

[[Image:SwarfSamples.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Various examples of swarf, including a block of compressed swarf]]

'''Swarf''', also known as '''chips''' or by other process-specific names (such as '''turnings''', '''filings''', or '''shavings'''), are pieces of metal, wood, or plastic that are the debris or waste resulting from [[machining]], [[woodworking]], or similar subtractive (material-removing) manufacturing processes. Swarf or chips can be small particles (such as the gritty swarf from [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] metal or the [[sawdust]] from sawing or [[sandpaper|sanding]] wood); long, stringy tendrils (such as the springy chips from [[turning]] [[toughness|tough]] metals, or long shavings from [[whittling]]); [[slag]]-like waste (such as is produced within pipe during [[pipefitter|pipefitting]] work); or [[rock (geology)|stone]] fragments and dust (as in [[masonry]]).&lt;ref name="MelvilleChips"&gt;"The universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago." —Ishmael, in ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', by Herman Melville.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these terms are [[mass noun]]s (such as ''swarf'' and ''sawdust'') and some of them are [[count noun]]s (such as ''chips'', ''filings'', or ''shavings''). 

The rest of this article discusses [[metalworking]] swarf. Wood swarf is discussed at ''[[sawdust]]''.

==Cutting hazards and safety precautions==
[[File:A song of fire and metal.jpg|alt=Bright sparks fly as a man grinds a piece of metal|thumb|Metal grinding produces ''grinding swarf''.]]

===Cuts, splinters, punctures, airborne chips===
Chips can be extremely sharp, and this creates a safety problem, as they can cause serious [[Laceration|injuries]] if not handled correctly. Depending on the composition of the material, it can persist in the environment for a long time before degrading. This, combined with the small size of some chips (e.g. those of [[brass]] or [[bronze]]), allows them to disperse widely by piggy-backing on soft materials and also to penetrate the skin as deep [[wikt:splinter|splinter]]s. 

It is standard training for [[machinist]]s, and usually a standing workplace rule, to avoid handling swarf with bare hands. Similarly, it is also standard training for [[machinist]]s, and usually a standing workplace rule, to minimize or entirely avoid handling swarf by blowing chips away with compressed air, but this practice is considered burdensome or impractical by some machinists - the rule of thumb is to reduce the potential hazard by trying to eliminate the problem as far as reasonably practicable this could simply be done by keeping a clean working environment. Some machine tool manuals proscribe this practice both for safety and for the preservation of way wipers and bearing seals. Alternatives to blowing chips away include vacuuming them away with an industrial vacuum (shop vacuum); gently washing them away with a [[cutting fluid|coolant]] hose discharging at typical garden-hose pressures; or preventing their generation in the first place (for example, [[Threading (manufacturing)#Thread forming and rolling|forming]] threads instead of [[Threading (manufacturing)#Thread cutting|cutting]] them). 

It is not uncommon for chips flying off the [[cutting tool (machining)|cutter]] to be ejected with great force and to fly several metres. These flying chips present a hazard that is deflected with [[safety glasses]], [[face shield]]s, and other [[personal protective equipment]], as well as the sheet-metal enclosures (and polycarbonate windows) that surround most commercial computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools.

===Flammability===

Due to its high surface area, swarf composed of some reactive metals can be highly flammable.  Caution should be exercised to avoid ignition sources when handling or storing swarf in loose form, especially swarf of pure magnesium, magnesium alloy, pure titanium, titanium alloy, iron, and non-stainless steel.

Swarf stored in piles or bins may also spontaneously combust, especially if the swarf is coated with cutting oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.ukpandi.com/fileadmin/uploads/uk-pi/LP%20Documents/Carefully_to_Carry/Scrap%20Metal.pdf
| title      = Scrap metal (borings, shavings, turnings, cuttings, dross)
| accessdate = {{date |  6 nov 2014}}
}} (dead link 9 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; 

To extinguish swarf fires, a special [[Fire_extinguisher#Class_D|fire extinguisher]] is needed, designed for fighting  [[Fire_classes#Class_D:_Metal|Class D]] (metal) fires.

===Toxicity===

Some common engineering materials such as [[Beryllium#Occupational_safety_and_health|beryllium]] are hazardous when finely divided and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent exposure.

==Chip breaking==
Optimum cutting efficiencies often generate long spring-like swarf. This is hard to deal with as it is bulky and can clog the nozzle of a [[Vacuum cleaner#Wet/dry|shop vac]]. Clean-up and disposal of this continuous-cutting swarf is made simpler by using a cutting tool with a chip-breaker. This results in denser, more manageable waste.
Chip breaking tool geometry is generally designed to break the chip by having it curl back onto itself. This action produces many small spiral shaped rings instead of one long helical chip.

==Machine cleaning and chip handling==
Disposing of swarf is a tedious but necessary task. For ease of transport and handling, swarf may be compressed into ''bricks'', which greatly reduces associated problems with storing and cost; it also improves material handling for all concerned with its reclamation and recycling.

==Recycling==
Metal swarf can usually be [[recycling|recycled]], and this is the preferred method of disposal due to the [[environmentalism|environmental concerns]] regarding potential contamination with [[cutting fluid]] or [[tramp oil]]. The ideal way to remove these liquids is by the use of a [[centrifuge]] which will separate the fluids from the metal, allowing both to be reclaimed and prepared for further treatment.
Small bundles of stainless steel or bronze swarf are sold as excellent scourers for dishwashing or cleaning encrustations of dirt.
[[Recycling]] chips rather than putting them in the garbage stream (heading to [[landfill]]ing or [[incineration]]) has various advantages: 
* Environmental
** As mentioned above, keep cutting fluid out of the waste stream
** Reduce the amount of ore mining and metal refining that must be done to meet the annual global demand for metal stocks. For example, it takes at least 4 times the energy per unit of production to produce aluminum billet from mined ore—plus the environmental impact of the mining itself—as it does to produce it from recycled scrap metal stocks (such as chips and bar drops).
* Financial
** There is almost always some money to be made from the stream of recycled chips, whether by the scrap processor, the machine shop, or often both. The scrap value (melt value) of the metal is a net gain beyond any costs of handling and transporting the chips.

===Requirements===
Machine shops are typically required by the scrap collector to: 
* segregate metal types (e.g., aluminum chips in separate barrels from steel chips)
** it is usually ''not'' required to segregate particular alloys (e.g., to keep 2024 aluminum separate from 6061)
* segregate solid chunks (such as bar end drops and scrapped-out parts) from chips (which are finer and are processed on different [[material handling equipment]]).
* drain and/or centrifuge all cutting fluid and way oil out of the chips. (within reason)

The '''Tehotitachsae''' were an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] of [[North America]] originally from [[Bradford County, Pennsylvania|Bradford County]], [[Pennsylvania]].

Their principal village, Gohontoto, was on the site of the present [[Wyalusing, Pennsylvania|Borough of Wyalusing]].

==History==

[[Moravian Church|Moravian]] Bishop [[John F. Cammerhoff]] wrote of a visit in 1750, "Here, they tell me, was in early times an Indian town, traces of which are still noticeable, e. g. corn-pits, etc., inhabited by a distinct nation (neither Aquinoschioni, i. e. [[Iroquois|Iriquois]], nor [[Lenape|Delawares]]), who spoke a peculiar language and were called Tehotitachsae; against these the Five Nations warred, and rooted them out. The [[Cayuga nation|Cayugas]] for a time held a number of them, but the Nation and their language are now exterminated and extinct."

Remnants of the Tehotitachsae most likely were assimilated into the Cayuga. Their former territories in Pennsylvania later settled by the [[Lenape]], who in 1752 established a settlement called M'chwihillusink on the site of Gohontoto. This would later become Wyalusing.

'''Victor Sadler''' (b. 1937) is a [[British people|British]]-born [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Esperantist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Scottish School (Skota Skolo) of Esperanto Writers|url=http://thecapitalscot.com/pastfeatures/esperanto/esperanto.html|work=The Capital Scot|accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sadler and Esperanto ==
Victor Sadler learnt [[Esperanto]] when he was 14, in 1951.

After his graduation in [[phonetics]], in 1962, at the end of that year he started working at the central office of the [[World Esperanto Association]] (UEA), in [[Rotterdam]] ([[Netherlands]]), where he cared after the magazine ''[[Esperanto (magazine)|Esperanto]]''. He also served as redactor of ''[[Monda Kulturo]]'', during the short lifespan of this other periodical, and he cared after the [[Hector Hodler library]], which is still nowadays one of the richest [[Esperanto libraries]] in the world.

In 1968 he followed [[Marianne H. Vermaas]] as the [[General Director of the World Esperanto Association]]. [[Akiko Uxusink-Nagata]] helped him write the magazine until 1970; in 1974 the task was definitively taken over by a new redactor, [[Simo Milojeviĉ]].

In this period, Sadler also cared after the organization of several [[World Congress of Esperanto|World Congresses of Esperanto]]. He resigned in 1983.

Sadler wrote literary works in Esperanto as well; in 1968 he received the award [[Arĝenta Sprono]] thanks to his collection of poems ''[[Memkritiko]]'' ("selfcritics"), although the preface to the work says that it was originally a manuscript that he found in the library.

In 1986 he was elected a member of the steering council of UEA, responsible for finances; nevertheless he had to resign on March 1987 because of health reasons.

Sadler also served as a member of the [[Esperanto Academy]], the organization which groups the most prominent Esperanto linguists and cares after the evolution of the language.

[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in support of "''fildelning''" ([[file sharing]], including of warez), in [[Sweden]] in 2006.]]

'''Warez''' is a common computing and broader cultural term referring to [[pirated software]] (i.e. illegally copied, often after deactivation of anti-piracy measures) that is distributed via the [[Internet]]. Warez is used most commonly as a [[noun]], a plural form of ''ware'' (short for [[computer software]]), and is intended to be pronounced like the word [[wikt:ware|wares]], {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɛər|z}}. The circumvention of copy protection ([[Software cracking|cracking]]) is an essential step in generating warez, and based on this common mechanism, the software-focused definition has been extended to include other copyright-protected materials, including movies and games. The global array of [[warez group]]s has been referred to as "The Scene," deriving from its earlier description as "the [[warez scene]]." Distribution and trade of [[copyright]]ed works without payment of fees or royalties generally violates national and international [[copyright law|copyright laws and agreements]]. The term warez covers supported as well as unsupported ([[abandonware]]) items, and legal prohibitions governing creation and distribution of warez cover both profit-driven and "enthusiast" generators and distributors of such items.

The term ''warez,'' which is intended to be pronounced like the word "wares" (/ˈwɛərz/), was coined in the 1990s;&lt;ref name=OxfordUSED/&gt; its origin is with an unknown member of an underground computing circle,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} but has since become commonplace among Internet users and the mass media.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} It is used most commonly as a noun:&lt;ref name=OxfordUSED/&gt; "My neighbour downloaded 10 gigabytes of warez yesterday"; but has also been used as a verb:{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} "The new Windows was warezed a month before the company officially released it".{{cite quote|date=August 2016}} The global collection of warez groups has been referred to as "The [[warez scene|Warez Scene]]," or more ambiguously "The Scene."&lt;ref name = Witt2015&gt;{{cite book | author = Witt, Stephen | year = 2015 | title = How Music Got Free: The End of an Industry, the Turn of the Century, and the Patient Zero of Piracy | location = London | publisher = Penguin | isbn = 0698152522 | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0698152522 | access-date = 26 August 2016}} Pages are as appear in the superscripted "rp" markup, inline.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.72}} &lt;ref name = Rehn2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rehn, Alf | year = 2004 | title = The politics of contraband: The honor economies of the warez scene | journal = The Journal of Socio-Economics | volume = 33 | issue = 3, July | pages = 359–374 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105353570300129X | access-date = 26 August 2016 | doi=10.1016/j.socec.2003.12.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Chandra2016/&gt;

While the term 'piracy' is commonly used to describe a significant range of activities, most of which are unlawful, the relatively neutral meaning in this context is "...mak[ing] use of or reproduc[ing] the work of another without authorization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Eds. of the AHD | title = The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language | edition = 4th | chapter = Pirate | url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/73/P0327300.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629183819/http://www.bartleby.com/61/73/P0327300.html | archivedate=2008-06-29 |publisher=[[Bartleby.com]] | access-date =2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups (including the GNU project of the [[Free Software Foundation]], FSF) object to the use of this and other words such as "theft" because they represent an attempt to create a particular impression in the reader:{{quote|Publishers often refer to prohibited copying as "piracy." In this way, they imply that illegal copying is ethically equivalent to attacking ships on the high seas, kidnapping and murdering the people on them.&lt;ref name=w2a&gt;See 'piracy' and 'theft' on [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html Words to Avoid (or Use with Care) Because They Are Loaded or Confusing] Free Software Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; }}The FSF advocates the use of terms like "prohibited copying" or "unauthorized copying", or "sharing information with your neighbor."&lt;ref name=w2a/&gt; Hence, the term "software pirate" is controversial; FSF derides its use, while many self-described pirates take pride in the term,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and some groups (e.g., [[Pirates with Attitudes]]) fully embrace it.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

''Direct download [DDL] sites'' are web locations that index links to locations where files can be directly downloaded to the user's computer; many such sites link to free [[file hosting service]]s, for the hosting of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filesharefreak.com/2008/02/02/advanced-searching-for-copyrighted-content-part-iv-ddl-websites/ |title=Advanced Searching for Copyrighted Content - Part IV - 'DDL' Websites |date=2008-02-02 |publisher=FileShareFreak |author=sharky |accessdate=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; DDL sites do not directly host the material and can avoid the fees that normally accompany large file hosting.

==Motivations and arguments==
{{original research | section|date=August 2016}}
The production and/or distribution of warez is illegal in most countries due to the protections provided in the [[TRIPS Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intellectual property rights in today’s digital economy |first=Adam |last=Denton |url=https://www.itu.int/ITU-D/treg/Events/Seminars/GSR/GSR11/documents/05-Intellectual-property-E.pdf |format=PDF |year=2011 |publisher=[[ITU]] |page=15 |quote=Copyright infringement is a civil offence in most jurisdictions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software [[Copyright infringement|infringers]] generally exploit the international nature of the [[copyright]] issue to avoid law enforcement in specific countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Violations are typically overlooked in poorer [[third world]] countries, and other countries with weak or non-existent protection for intellectual property.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Additionally, some first world countries have loopholes in legislation that allow the warez to continue.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

There is also a movement, exemplified by groups like [[The Pirate Party]] and scholars at [[The Mises Institute]], that the very idea of [[intellectual property]] is an [[anathema]] to [[free society]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This is in contrast to some of the more traditional [[open source]] advocates such as [[Lawrence Lessig]], who advocate for middle ground between freedom and intellectual property.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Legality==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
{{details|Copyright infringement#Legality}}
Generally, there are four elements of criminal copyright infringement: the existence of a valid [[copyright]], that copyright was infringed, the infringement was willful, and the infringement was either substantial, or for commercial gain (at levels often set by [[statute]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Offering warez is generally understood to be a form of [[copyright infringement]] that is punishable as either a [[Tort|civil wrong]] or a [[criminal law|crime]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Often sites hosting torrent files claim that they are not breaking any laws because they are not offering the actual data, rather only a link to other places or peers that contain the infringing material.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} However, many prosecution cases and convictions argue to the contrary. For instance, Dimitri Mader, the French national who operates a movie distribution warez site, Wawa-Mania, was fined 20,000 € and sentenced, in absentia, to a year in jail by a European court (after fleeing France for the Philippines), for his role in managing the site.&lt;ref name = AndyTF15&gt;{{cite journal | author = [Maxwell,] Andy | date = 2015-04-11 | title = Sentenced to Jail, Warez Operator Faces $30m Damages Claim | journal = TorrentFreak | url = https://torrentfreak.com/sentenced-to-jail-warez-operator-faces-30m-damages-claim-150410/ | access-date = 26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., through 2004, more than 80 individuals had been prosecuted and convicted for trade in warez products (under the [[NET Act]] and other statutes), for movie and software pirating in particular, with a number of individuals being imprisoned, including some enthusiast traders.&lt;ref name = Schwabach1406/&gt;{{rp|p.308}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goldman, Eric | year = 2004 | title = Warez Trading and Criminal Copyright Infringement | journal = Journal of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A. | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 395–436, esp. 427. | ssrn = 487163 | access-date = }} See also, Goldman, Eric (2004-01-07), "Warez Trading and Criminal Copyright Infringement," Working Paper, see [http://ssrn.com/abstract=487163] or [https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.487163].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, laws and their application to warez activities may vary greatly from country to country;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} for instance, while Wawa-Mania is under sanction in France, it remains in operation via a host in Moldova, and through use of an Ecuadorian top-level domain.&lt;ref name = AndyTF15/&gt; Hence, while high-profile web hosts and domain providers{{who|date=August 2016}} generally do not permit the hosting of warez, and delete sites found to be hosting them,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} private endeavours and small commercial entities continue to allow the trade in warez to continue.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} And, in some countries, and at some times, software "piracy" has been encouraged, and international and usual national legal protections ignored.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} A dispute between [[Iran]] and United States over membership in [[WTO]] and subsequent U.S. block of Iran's attempts at full-membership has led Iran to encourage the copying of U.S. software; hence, there has been a subsequent surge in Iranian "warez" and "crackz" websites (as Iranian laws do not forbid [[Iran and copyright issues|hosting them inside Iran]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The same policy has been adopted by Antigua,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and others.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Warez distribution==
{{main|Warez scene}}
[[File:Warez Hierarchy.svg|thumb|Warez scene hierarchy.]]
Warez are often distributed outside of [[Warez scene|The Scene]] (a collection of warez groups) by [[.torrent|torrents]] (files including tracker info, piece size, uncompressed file size, comments, and vary in size from 1&amp;nbsp;k, to 400&amp;nbsp;k.) uploaded to a popular P2P website by an associate or friend of the cracker or cracking crew. An [[.nfo|nfo]] or [[FILE ID.DIZ]] is often made to promote who created the release. It is then leeched (downloaded) by users of the [[BitTorrent tracker|tracker]] and spread to other sharing sites using P2P, or other sources such as [[Newsgroup#Binary newsgroups|newsgroups]]. From there, it can be downloaded by millions of users all over the world. Often, one release is duplicated, renamed, then re-uploaded to different sites so that eventually, it can become impossible to trace the original file. Another increasingly popular method of distributing Warez is via [[One-click hosting|one-click hosting websites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roettgers, Janko | title = Piracy Beyond P2P: One-Click Hosters | date = 2007-06-17 | journal = [[Gigaom]] | url = https://gigaom.com/2007/06/17/one-click-hosters/ | access-date = 26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, warez were often traded on cassette tapes with different groups and published on bulletin boards that had a warez section.

===Rise of software infringement===
{{unreferenced section | date=March 2009}}
Unauthorized copying has been an ongoing phenomenon that started when high quality, commercially produced software was released for sale. Whether the medium was cassette tape or floppy disk, cracking enthusiasts found a way to duplicate the software and spread it without the permission of the maker. Thriving bootlegging communities were built around the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], the [[Atari 400]] and [[Atari 800]] line, the [[ZX Spectrum]], the [[Amiga]], and the [[Atari ST]], among other personal computers. Entire networks of [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]es sprang up to traffic illegal software from one user to the next. Machines like the [[Amiga]] and the [[Commodore 64]] had an international network, through which software not available on one continent would eventually make its way to every region via [[bulletin board system]]s.

It was also quite common in the 1980s to use physical floppy disks and the [[mail|postal service]] for spreading software, in an activity known as ''mail trading''. Prior to the sale of software that came on CD-ROM discs and after hard drives had become available, the software did not require the floppy disc to be in the drive when starting and using the program. So, a user could install it onto his/her computer and mail the disk to the next person, who could do the same. Particularly widespread in continental Europe, mail trading was even used by many of the leading [[Software cracking|cracker]] groups as their primary channel of interaction. Software copyright violation via mail trading was also the most common means for many computer hobbyists in the [[Eastern bloc]] countries to receive new Western software for their computers.

[[File:Pftp-99.png|thumb|250px|right|A screen shot of pftp logged into several ftp sites. This tool was used by couriers to quickly and easily move large amounts of software from one site to many others. Since couriering was competitive, using this tool was considered cheating.]]
Copy-protection schemes for the early systems were designed to defeat casual duplication attempts, as "[[Software cracking|crackers]]" would typically release a copied game to the "pirate" community the day they were earmarked for market.

A famous event in the history of software copyright policy was an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists|open letter]] written by [[Bill Gates]] of [[Microsoft]], dated February 3, 1976, in which he argued that the quality of available software would increase if "software piracy" were less prevalent. However, until the early 1990s, software copyright infringement was not yet considered a serious problem by most people. In 1992, the [[Software Publishers Association]] began to battle against this phenomenon, with its promotional video "[[Don't Copy That Floppy]]". It and the [[Business Software Alliance]] have remained the most active anti-infringement organizations worldwide, although to compensate for extensive growth in recent years, they have gained the assistance of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), as well as [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI).

Today most warez files are distributed to the public via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|bittorrent]] and [[One-click hosting|One-click hosting sites]]. Some of the most popular software companies that are being targeted are Adobe, Microsoft, Nero, Apple, DreamWorks, and Autodesk, to name a few. To reduce the spread of illegal copying, some companies have hired people to release "fake" torrents (known as [[Torrent poisoning]]), which look real and are meant to be downloaded, but while downloading the individual does not realize that the company that owns the software has received his/her [[IP address]]. They will then contact his/her [[Internet service provider|ISP]], and further legal action may be taken by the company/ISP.{{clarify|date=August 2016}}
&lt;!--ummm, if the torrent is fake, then no copyright infringement has taken place, and therefore there are no grounds to sue. Also, if a representative of the company is distributing these goods, then copying it may be authorized, as a company or person cannot violate its own copyright.--&gt;

===Causes that have accelerated its growth===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016 }}
In the mid-1990s, [[computers]] became more popular. This was largely attributed to [[Microsoft]] and the release of [[Windows 95]], which made using an [[IBM PC compatible]] computer much easier for home users. Windows 95 became so popular that in developed countries nearly every middle-class household had at least one computer.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Similar to [[televisions]] and [[telephones]], computers became a necessity to every person in the [[information age]]. As the use of computers increased, so had [[cybercrime|software and cyber crimes]].

In the mid-1990s, the average [[Internet]] user was still on [[dial-up]], with average speed ranging between 28.8 and 33.6 [[Kilobit per second|kbit/s]]. If one wished to download a piece of software, which could run about 200 [[Megabyte|MB]], the download time could be longer than one day, depending on network traffic, the [[Internet Service Provider]], and the server. Around 1997, [[broadband]] began to gain popularity due to its greatly increased network speeds. As "large-sized file transfer" problems became less severe, warez became more widespread and began to affect large [[software]] files like [[animations]] and [[Film|movies]].

In the past, files were distributed by [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] technology: with a central uploader distributing files to downloaders. With these systems, a large number of downloaders for a popular file uses an increasingly larger amount of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. If there are too many downloads, the server can become unavailable. The opposite is true for [[peer-to-peer]] networking; the ''more'' downloaders the ''faster'' the file distribution is. With [[segmented downloading|swarming technology]] as implemented in [[file sharing]] systems like [[eDonkey2000]] or [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]], downloaders help the uploader by picking up some of its uploading responsibilities. There are many sites with links to [[One-click hosting]] websites and other sites where one can upload files that contribute to the growing amount of warez.

===Distribution via compromised FTP servers===
Prior to the development of modern peer-to-peer sharing systems and home broadband service, sharing warez sometimes involved warez groups scanning the Internet for weakly secured computer systems with high-speed connections. These weakly secured systems would be compromised by exploiting the poor FTP security, creating a special directory on the server with an unassuming name to contain the illegal content.&lt;ref name="Koziol 2003 72"&gt;{{cite book | last = Koziol | first = Jack | title = Intrusion Detection with Snort | publisher = Sams Publishing | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-57870-281-X | page = 72 }} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=W2xN6XmedWIC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=warez+compromise+ftp&amp;source=web&amp;ots=RCdWIUVpHq&amp;sig=tSMhGMVoTfOxRFrO8gr-ZeKtUz4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result View cited page] using [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Software Piracy Exposed: How Software is Stolen and Traded Over the Internet - By Paul Craig, Ron Honick, Mark Burnett, Published by Syngress, 2005, {{ISBN|1-932266-98-4}}, Chapter 7 - The Distribution Chain, Pages 144-145 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=cA3qL9PBR0kC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=warez+IRC&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U2Gkn4cjHY9kQIZcmG1zB9UW7THkg#PPA145,M1 View cited pages] using [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt;

A common mistake of early FTP administrators was to permit a directory named /incoming that allows full read and write access by external users, but the files themselves in /incoming were hidden; by creating a directory inside /incoming, this hidden directory would then allow normal file viewing.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Users of the compromised site would be directed to log in and go to a location such as /incoming/data/warez to find the warez content. Messages could be left for other warez users by uploading a plain text file with the message inside.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Hackers would also use known software bugs to illicitly gain full administrative remote control over a computer, and install a hidden FTP service to host their wares.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This FTP service was usually running on an unusual port number, or with a non-anonymous login name like "login: warez / Password: warez" to help prevent discovery by legitimate users; information about this compromised system would then be distributed to a select group of people who were part of the warez scene.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

It was important for warez group members to regulate who had access to these compromised FTP servers, to keep the network bandwidth usage low.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} A site that suddenly became very popular would be noticed by the real owners of the equipment, as their business systems became slow or low on disk space; investigation of system usage would then inevitably result in discovery and removal of the warez, and tightening of the site security.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Automated warez distribution via IRC bots===
As the ability to compromise and attain full remote control of business servers became more developed, the warez groups would hack a server and install an [[IRC]] bot on the compromised systems alongside the [[FTP]] service, or the IRC bot would provide file sharing directly by itself. This software would intelligently regulate access to the illicit data by using file queues to limit bandwidth usage, or by only running during off-hours overnight when the business owning the compromised hardware was closed for the day.&lt;ref name="Koziol 2003 72"/&gt;

In order to advertise the existence of the compromised site, the IRC software would join public IRC ''warez'' channels as a ''bot'' and post into the channel with occasional status messages every few minutes, providing information about how many people are logged into the warez host, how many files are currently being downloaded, what the upload/download ratio is (to force users into contributing data of their own before they can download), which warez distributor is running the bot, and other status information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Software Piracy Exposed: How Software is Stolen and Traded Over the Internet |author1=Paul Craig |author2=Ron Honick |author3=Mark Burnett |publisher=Syngress |year=2005 |isbn=1-932266-98-4 |chapter=Chapter 7 - The Distribution Chain |pages=145–148}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=cA3qL9PBR0kC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=warez+IRC&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U2Gkn4cjHY9kQIZcmG1zB9UW7THkg#PPA145,M1 View cited pages] using [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt;

This functionality still exists and can still be found on IRC ''warez'' channels, as an alternative to the modern and streamlined [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] distribution systems.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The opportunity to find and compromise poorly secured systems on which to create an illicit warez distribution site has only increased with the popular use of broadband service by home users who may not fully understand the security implications of having their home computer always turned on and connected to the Internet.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Types of warez==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
There is generally a distinction made between different sub-types of warez. The unusual spellings shown here were commonly used as directory names within a compromised server, to organize the files rather than having them all thrown together in a single random collection.

* '''Apps''' - [[Application software|Applications]]: Generally a retail version of a software package.
* '''Cracks''' - [[Software cracking|Cracked applications]]: A modified executable or more (usually one) and/or a library (usually one) or more and/or a patch designed to turn a trial version of a software package into the full version and/or bypass [[digital rights management|copy protections]].
* '''Dox''' - [[Video game]] add-ons: These include nocds, cracks, trainers, cheat codes etc.
* '''EBook''' - [[E-books]]: These include unlicensed copies of [[Ebooks]], scanned books, scanned comics, etc.
* '''Games''' - [[Video game|Games]]: This scene concentrates on both computer based games, and video game consoles, often released as [[ISO image|ISO]] or other format disk image.
* '''Hacks''' - [[Security hacker|Simplified/Specific Hacking Tools]]: Programs designed to perform specific hacks at the click of a button, typically with a limited scope, such as [[AOHell]] and AOL4Free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxiv/10.3.97/exclusive/letter.html |title=The Truth - by Nicholas Ryan |date=1997-04-17 |publisher=Yale Herald (David Cassel) |author=Nicholas Ryan |accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/04/3309 |title=AOL4FREE Culprit Tells His Tale |date=1997-04-22 |publisher=Wired |author=David Cassel |accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Keygen by MESMERiZE.png|thumb|Screenshot of Keygen by MESMERiZE]]
* '''Keygens''' - [[Keygen]] software are tools that replicate the registration/activation process of a genuine software product and generate the necessary [[Product key|keys]] to activate the software.
* '''Movies''' - [[Film|Movies]]: Unauthorized copies of movies, can be released while still in theaters or from CDs/DVDs/Blu-ray prior to the actual retail date.
* '''MP3s''' - [[MP3]] audio: Audio from albums, singles, or other sources usually obtained by [[Ripping|ripping a CD]] or a [[Radio music ripping|radio broadcast]] and released in the compressed audio format [[MP3]].
* '''MVids''' - [[Music videos]] - Can be ripped from TV, HDTV, DVDs or VCDs.
* '''NoCD''', '''NoDVD''', '''FixedExe''' - A file modification that allows an installed program to be run without inserting the CD or DVD into the drive.
* '''RIP''' - A game that [[portable application|doesn't have to be installed]]; any required registry entry can be included as a .reg file. RIP games can be ripped of music and/or video files, or, for video games, [[ROM image|ROMs]], thus decreasing the size of the download.&lt;ref&gt;Software Piracy Exposed: How Software is Stolen and Traded Over the Internet - By Paul Craig, Ron Honick, Mark Burnett, Published by Syngress, 2005, {{ISBN|1-932266-98-4}}, Chapter 4 - Crackers, Pages 88–90 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=cA3qL9PBR0kC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=warez+RIPs+games&amp;sig=ACfU3U3FMMzELyiIRfCe1Brm9_YPb_ZTvw#PPA90,M1 View cited pages] using [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; RIPs with nothing ripped out sometimes are referred to as DP (direct play).
* '''Portables''' - [[Portable applications]]: Similar to RIPs, but in this case they're software applications instead of video games. The point of portable software is the fact that it can be placed on removable media (or any place on the local hard drive) and doesn't need installing; usually it is compressed into one executable file, by using software like [[VMware ThinApp]] or [[MoleBox]].
* '''Scripts''' - [[Scripting language|Scripts]]: These include unlicensed copies of commercial scripts (such as vBulletin, Invision Power Board, etc.) coded by companies in [[PHP]], [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], and other languages.
* '''Subs''' - [[Subtitles]]: can be integrated in a TV-Rip or Movie.
* '''Serials''' - Refers to a collection of [[Product key|keys]] such as [[serial numbers]] made available for the purpose of activating trial software, without payment.
* '''Templates''' - [[Web template|Templates]]: These include leaked commercial website templates coded by companies.
* '''TV-Rips''' - [[TV|Television programs]]: Television shows or movies, usually with commercials edited out. Commonly released within a few hours after airing. DVD Rips of television series fall under this sub-type.
* '''XXX''' - [[Pornography]]: These can be imagesets, [[paysite]] videos or retail movies.
* '''Zero-day''' or '''0-day''' - Any copyrighted work that has been released the same day as the original product, or sometimes even before.&lt;ref name=gehring&gt;

==Movie infringement==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
{{Main|Pirated movie release types}}
[[Film|Movie]] [[copyright infringement]] was looked upon as impossible by the major studios. When [[dial-up]] was common in early and mid-1990s, movies distributed on the [[Internet]] tended to be small. The technique that was usually used to make them small was to use [[Video compression|compression]] [[software]], thus lowering the video quality significantly. At that time, the largest copyright violation threat was software.

However, along with the rise in [[broadband]] internet connections beginning around 1998, higher quality movies began to see widespread distribution – with the release of [[DeCSS]], [[ISO 9660|ISO]] images copied directly from the original DVDs were slowly becoming a feasible distribution method. Today, movie sharing has become so common that it has caused major concern amongst movie studios and their representative organizations. Because of this the [[MPAA]] is often running campaigns during movie trailers where it tries to discourage people from copying material without permission. Unlike the music industry, which has had online music stores available for several years, the movie industry moved to online distribution only in 2006, after the launch of [[Amazon Unbox]].

Because of this, cameras are sometimes forbidden in movie theaters.

==File formats of warez==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
{{details|Standard (warez)}}
A [[Compact disc|CD]] software release can contain up to 700&amp;nbsp;[[megabytes]] of data, which presented challenges when sending over the Internet, particularly in the late 1990s when broadband was unavailable to most home consumers. These challenges apply to an even greater extent for a single-layer [[DVD]] release, which can contain up to 4.7&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] of data. The warez scene made it standard practice to split releases up into many separate pieces, called disks, using several file compression formats: (historical [[Tar (file format)|TAR]], [[LHA (file format)|LZH]], [[ACE (compression file format)|ACE]], UHA, [[ARJ]]), [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]], and most commonly [[RAR (file format)|RAR]]. The original purpose of these "disks" was so that each .rar file could fit on a single 1.44&amp;nbsp;MB 3½ inch [[floppy disk]]. With the growing size of games, this is no longer feasible, as hundreds of disks would need to be used. The average size of disks released by groups today are 50&amp;nbsp;[[megabytes]] or 100&amp;nbsp;[[megabytes]], however it is common to find disks up to 200&amp;nbsp;[[megabytes]].

This method has many advantages over sending a single large file:
*The two-layer compression could sometimes achieve almost a tenfold improvement over the original DVD/CD image. The overall file size is cut down and lessens the transfer time and bandwidth required.
*If there is a problem during the file transfer and data was corrupted, it is only necessary to resend the few corrupted RAR files instead of resending the entire large file.
*This method also allows the possibility of downloading separate ‘disks’ from different sources, as an early attempt at modern [[segmented downloading]].
**In the case of [[One-click hosting|One-click hosting websites]] downloading multiple files from one or several sources can significantly increase download speeds. This is because even if the source(s) provides slow download speeds on individual disks, downloading several disks simultaneously will allow the user to achieve much greater download rates.

Despite the fact that many modern ftp programs support segmented downloading, the compression via RAR, ZIP, and breaking up of files has not changed.

Releases of software titles often come in two forms. The '''full''' form is a full version of a game or application, generally released as CD or DVD-writable [[disk images]] ([[ISO image|BIN]] or [[ISO 9660 image|ISO]] files). A '''rip''' is a cut-down version of the title in which additions included on the legitimate DVD/CD (generally [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] manuals, help files, tutorials, and audio/video media) are omitted. In a game rip, generally all game video is removed, and the audio is compressed to [[MP3]] or [[Vorbis]], which must then be decoded to its original form before playing. These rips are very rare today, as most modern [[broadband]] connections can easily handle the full files, and the audio is usually already compressed by the original producer in some fashion.

==Warez and malware==
There is a common perception that warez sites represent high risk in terms of [[malware]].&lt;ref name="mobilemalware"&gt;{{cite web |title=Warez site riddled with mobile malware |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/21/simworks_trojan_alert/ |first=John|last=Leyden |date=2005-04-21 |work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are several papers showing there is indeed correlation between warez/file sharing sites and [[malware]]. In particular, one study&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A. Moshchuk, T. Bragin, S. D. Gribble, and H. M. Levy. A crawler-based study of spyware in the web. |author1=Alexander Moshchuk |author2=Tanya Bragin |author3=Steven D. Gribble |author4=Henry M. Levy |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=In Proceedings of the 13th Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS '06)|date=February 2006|url=http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gribble/papers/spycrawler.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that out of all domains the study classified as ''pirate'', 7.1% are infected (while out of ''random'' domains only 0.4% were infected); another study&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Monkey-Spider:Detecting Malicious Web Sites|first=Ali|last=Ikinci|date=May 2007|publisher=University of Mannheim, Laboratory for Dependable Distributed Systems|url=http://www1.cs.fau.de/filepool/thesis/diplomarbeit-2007-ikinci.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintains that '"maliciousness" of the content for sites they classified as ''pirate'' (which specifically included ''warez'' sites) is the highest among all the researched site categories. Domains related to anti-copy protection tools are among the most malicious sites.&lt;ref name="Kammerstetter:2012:VCM:2382196.2382282" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ikinci08monkey-spider:detecting"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ali Ikinci |author2=Thorsten Holz |author3=Felix Freiling |chapter=Monkey-Spider: Detecting Malicious Websites with Low-Interaction Honeyclients |title=In Proceedings of Sicherheit, Schutz und Zuverlässigkeit |year=2008 |url=http://pi1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/filepool/publications/monkey-spider.pdf |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study specifically targeted anti-copy protection tools such as cracks and key generators. They conclude that the majority of these programs aim to infect the user's computer with one or more types of malware. The chance of the end-user being exposed to malicious code when dealing with cracked applications or games is more than 50%.&lt;ref name="Kammerstetter:2012:VCM:2382196.2382282"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Markus Kammerstetter |author2=Christian Platzer |author3=Gilbert Wondracek |chapter=Vanity, cracks and malware: insights into the anti-copy protection ecosystem |title=Proceedings of the 2012 ACM conference on Computer and communications security |year=2012 |pages=809–820 |publisher=ACM |location=Raleigh, North Carolina, USA |series=CCS '12 |doi=10.1145/2382196.2382282 | isbn=978-1-4503-1651-4 |url=http://www.iseclab.org/papers/vanity_cracks_malware_ccs2012.pdf |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These statistical data can be questionable though, because most prominent Antivirus software programs tend to classify KeyGens as viruses ''a priori'', although most keygens do not infect the users' computers in any way.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Infected warez directly from the [[warez scene]] on the other hand, is a very unusual occurrence. The malicious content is usually added at a later stage by third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/piracy-release-group-has-been-spying-on-downloaders-for-9-months-131111/ |title=Piracy Release Group Has Been Spying on Downloaders For 9 Months |date=2013-11-11 |author=Andy |website=[[TorrentFreak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

Warez traders share many similarities to both hackers and crackers. Primary warez distribution groups include a single cracker that renders all copy protected technologies in a warez inoperable. Unlike the typical age of a hacker and cracker, the general age and demographics of a warez trader are older and married IT professionals. The need for attention is another similarity between the groups as well as believe that digital property should be free.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=E. Goldman.

'''Web literacy''' comprises the skills and competencies needed for reading, writing and participating on the web.&lt;ref name="weblitmap"&gt;[https://webmaker.org/literacy Mozilla Web Literacy Map v1.1.0]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "both content and activity" – i.e., web users should not just learn about the web but also how to make their own website.&lt;ref name="fastco"&gt;Davidson, C.N. &amp; Surman, M. [http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680264/why-web-literacy-should-be-part-of-every-education "Why Web Literacy Should Be Part of Every Education"], Fast Company. Retrieved 2 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Web literacy is closely related to [[digital literacy]],  [[information literacy]], and [[network literacy]], but differs in taking a more holistic approach.

==History of the concept==
In the latter part of the 1990s, literacy researchers started to explore the differences between printed text and the network-enabled devices with screens. This research was largely focused on two areas: the credibility of information that can be found on the [[World Wide Web]]&lt;ref name="Detweiler"&gt;Detweiler, M. C., Hess, S. M., &amp; Peck, A. C. (1996, October). Acquiring User-Centered Design Skills by Designing and Evaluating World Wide Web Pages. In ''Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting'' (Vol. 40, No. 8, pp. 459-462). SAGE Publications&lt;/ref&gt; and the difference that [[hypertext]] makes to 'reading' and 'writing'.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;Snyder, I., &amp; Joyce, M. (Eds.). (1998). ''Page to screen: Taking literacy into the electronic era.'' Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These skills were included in definitions of information literacy and included in a [[SCONUL]] position paper in 1999.&lt;ref name="SCONULpaper"&gt;SCONUL Advisory Committee on Information Literacy (1999) Information skills in higher education:

The '''"Why Mom Deserves a Diamond" contest''' is an American [[essay]] [[competition|contest]] founded by Michael (Diamond Mike) Watson in Costa Mesa, [[California]] in 1993.  The contest was established in honor of Watson's adoptive mother and the birth mother he had never known. In a limited amount of words, children are asked to write essays explaining why their mother deserves a [[diamond]].

Hundreds of thousands of American children have participated, and  dozens of kids have won the grand prize of a diamond to give to their [[mothers]] (and other precious [[Gemstone|gems]]).&lt;ref&gt;Heeger, Jack "Mother's Day Contest Builds Business And Goodwill", JCK online, 4 January 1996, http://www.jckonline.com/article/291161-Mother_s_Day_Contest_Builds_Business_And_Goodwill.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Why Mom Deserves a Diamond Contest (TM) Gallery of Diamonds; Costa Mesa, CA", Instore Magazine online, 2 July 2008, http://www.instoremag.com/instore/best-stores/benchmarks/997-best-mothers-day-promotions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Kids Say the Darndest Things", Professional Jeweler Magazine online, April 2002, http://www.professionaljeweler.com/archives/articles/2002/apr02/0402i2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Seventh Grader Wins 'Why Mom Deserves a Diamond' Contest", JCK online, 8 January 2004, http://www.jckonline.com/article/290987-Seventh_Grader_Wins_Why_Mom_Deserves_a_Diamond_Contest.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Harrison: "La Palma", Los Angeles Times online, 7 May 1999, http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/07/local/me-34899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glowish, Amanda: "Words worth a diamond", The Orange County Register, 19 March 2007, http://www.ocregister.com/articles/contest-60615-glidden-mother.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Beth: "Girl pens poem wins quarter-carat diamond for mother", Amarillo Globe News, 3 May 2000, http://www.amarillo.com/stories/050300/fri_050300-10.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== The First Diamond Winner ==
[[File:First Why Mom Deserves a Diamond contest winner.jpg|thumb|469x469px|Founder Diamond Mike Watson presents the unmounted diamond to the first diamond winner, Margaret Ketchersid, to give to her mother, Ruth.]]
On Mother’s Day, May 9, 1993, sophomore Margaret Ketchersid from Edison High School in Huntington Beach, California was awarded the grand prize of a quarter-carat diamond to give to her mother, Ruth.  Following is her winning essay.
''

Her love is not blind - it is clear and forgiving
Her touch is all-knowing - her joy life giving
This angel, my mother, gives of herself
And illuminates me with compassion’s true wealth

A symbol of courage and strength she remains
And understands all my joys and pains
To gaze at my mother, who strives beyond duty
Is to see radiate her unique, warming beauty!

The sweet voice of mother - her strong, safe, embrace
I long to possess her pure, natural, grace
My Mother, my guide, and gemstone so rare
Deserves out of likeness a diamond as fair''

== The Founder ==

[[File:MarthaVeliaWatson-WhyMomDeservesADiamond1920-2006.jpg|left|260x260px|'''Martha Velia Watson&lt;br&gt;'''March 15, 1920 – September 14, 2006|thumb]]
Michael (Diamond Mike) Watson was born and adopted in Indianapolis in 1958.  He spent his early life in New Albany, where his adopted parents raised him.  The foundation of the contest began while Watson was searching for his own birth mother when he was 17. [Source: “For the Love of Mom.”  Daily Pilot. April 30, 1992.]

About the same time he started his quest, Watson entered the jewelry industry as an errand boy for a store in New Albany. He joined a retail chain and worked in jewelry stores in Indiana, Kentucky and Kansas City, then moved to California in 1989. [Source: “Watson Strikes Gold with Diamond Shop.” Tribune. Pg 6. August 6, 1992.]

His first job ended when the store was sold and the next one when the store went out of business.  In 1991, Watson opened Gallery of Diamonds Jewelers in Costa Mesa, California.  [Source: “Mother’s Day Contest Builds Business and Goodwill.” Jewelers Circular Keystone.  April 1996.]

Watson obtained a copy of his hospital bill from Community Hospital, which showed his mother's name (Betty Price) and age. Armed with this information, he embarked on a search that lasted nearly 20 years. [Source: Ibid. pg. 144.]

Watson found the judge who had presided over the adoption only to learn that the records were sealed.  The judge did, however, give Watson the report by the Department of Public Welfare, which contained information about his birth mother. [Source: “One Man’s Search.”  New Albany Tribune. 1995.]

The report listed names and a wedding date, and he contacted every county in Indiana to locate a wedding license. In mid-1994 he heard from the courthouse in Coatesville that the information on the license matched. He found that his birth mother's maiden name was Stewart, and also discovered her parent's address and telephone number. [Source: “The Search is Finally Over.” Newport Beach/ Costa Mesa Daily Pilot. September 16, 1994.]

When calling his biological grandmother, she said that no one knew he was alive because his birth mother told the family he was stillborn. He then learned that his mother had died in 1981. [Source: “Surprising Twists in Two Searches for Family Roots.”  Los Angeles Times. January 28, 1998.]

The Why Mom Deserves a Diamond contest became increasingly important for Watson to allow kids to express their appreciation for their own mothers, especially while they are still living.

Over the years, the Why Mom Deserves a Diamond contest brought thousands of ethnically diverse families to Gallery of Diamonds Jewelers. In an effort to educate people of a broadened concept of mutual love and respect for people of foreign countries, Watson conceptualized a word that would mean, "the intense love and respect of persons from diverse backgrounds.” In 2016, with the help of wordsmith Doug Lowry, the word “uniphilarsian” was created, meaning “one who loves, regards, and watches over the unique aspect of every other person.”

From 1993-2012, Watson published the winning entries in an annual book to raise money for the local county's library. “Area Library Shines from Essay Sales.” Costa Mesa Daily Pilot. September 2, 1997.  To date, approximately 20,000 kids submit their essays to the company's headquarters in Santa Ana, California, and nearly four thousand families come to Gallery of Diamonds Jewelers every year. [Source: “Why Mom Deserves a Diamond Expands Contest to Jewelers.” Diamond News. January 30, 2012.]

Watson earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Indiana University Southeast and is a gemologist from the Gemological Institute of America.  He is the author of Moon Over Mountains- The Search for Mom, The Legend of Why Mom Deserves a Diamond, Tales of Imagination- Everything is Real, In Search of Mom- Journey of an Adoptee, and Adopted Like Me- Chosen to Search for a Birthmother. “Search for Birth Mother Results in Special Book for Watson.” New Albany Ledger Tribune. May 10, 1998. The Orange County Register newspaper named him the winner of the "Holiday Spirit Award" in 1995, awarded to business owners who display the holiday spirit throughout the year. “It’s Your Business.”  [Source: Orange County Register. December 25, 1995.]

B. Tauris, 2011), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

‘Inān was born a ''muwallada'' (daughter of an Arab father and slave mother) to ‘Abd-Allāh.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Sā‘ī, ''Consorts of the Caliphs: Women and the Court of Baghdad'', ed. by Shawkat M. Toorawa, trans. by the Editors of the Library of Arabic Literature (New York: New York University Press, 2015), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; She was trained in [[Yamāma]]. She was sold to Abū Khālid al-Nāṭifī, who brought her to [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuad Matthew Caswell, ''The Slave Girls of Baghdad: The 'Qiyān' in the Early Abbasid Era'' (London: I. B. Tauris, 2011), pp. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the assessment of Fuad Matthew Caswell,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Her salon at the house of al-Nāṭifī was frequented by the celebrated poets and men of letters of the time, including [[Abū Nuwās]], [[Di‘bil al-Khuzā‘ī]], [[Marwān b. Abī Ḥafṣa]], [[al-‘Abbās b. al-Aḥnaf]] and [[al-Ma’mūn]]'s tutor [[al-Yazīdī al-Ḥimyarī]], among a host of others, one of the attractions being that her master was devoid of jealously and tolerated the ease with which she bestowed her favours.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

‘Inān's fame led Caliph [[Hārūn al-Rashīd]] to seek to buy her, but he refused al-Nāṭifī's asking price of 100,000 [[dinar|dīnārs]]. However, on al-Nāṭifī's death, al-Rashīd had ‘Inān put up for auction, ostensibly to help clear al-Nāṭifī's debts. Via an agent, al-Rashīd then acquired her for 225,000 dirhams. As al-Rashīd's concubine, ‘Inān bore him two sons, both of whom died young. She accompanied him to Khurāsān where he, and, soon after, she died.&lt;ref&gt;Fuad Matthew Caswell, ''The Slave Girls of Baghdad: The 'Qiyān' in the Early Abbasid Era'' (London: I. B. Tauris, 2011), pp. 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

‘Inān was noted for her rapier-like repartee, which was often sexual or even vulgar in tone, and this will have been an important aspect of her fame/infamy.&lt;ref&gt;Fuad Matthew Caswell, ''The Slave Girls of Baghdad: The 'Qiyān' in the Early Abbasid Era''  (London: I. B. Tauris, 2011), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of her surviving corpus comprises her responses to male poets' challenges in [[verse-capping]] contests. A significant proportion of her surviving verse is dialogue with the famed poet Abū Nuwās.&lt;ref&gt;Fuad Matthew Caswell, ''The Slave Girls of Baghdad: The 'Qiyān' in the Early Abbasid Era'' (London: I. B. Tauris, 2011), p. 64-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==

As rendered by Eric Ormsby, one of the virtuosic yet obscene exchanges between ‘Inān and Abū Nuwās runs thus:&lt;ref&gt;Eric Ormsby, 'Questions for stones: On classical Arabic Poetry', ''Parnassus: Poetry in Review'', 25 (2001), 18-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One day she asked him whether he was any good at scansion; when Abu Nuwas replied boastfully that he was superb at it, she said, "Try scanning this verse:

::I ate Syrian mustard on a baker's platter...
::(''akaltu ‘l-khardalah sh-shā’mi fī ṣafḥati khabbāzī...'')

Abu Nuwas broke the line into metrical feet and responded:

::''Akaltu ‘l-khar''...ti-tum ti-tum

which means:

::I ate some shit ti-tum ti-tum...

The assembled courtiers broke into loud laughter at the poet's expense. Not to be outdone, he asked ‘Inān whether she could scan the following (rather nonsensical) verse:

::Keep your church far from us, O sons of the wood-carrier...!
::(''ḥawwilū ‘annā kanīsatakum yā banī ḥammālati l-ḥaṭabi''...)

She too had to break up the metrical feet to produce:

::''ḥawwilū ‘an'' tum-ti tum-ti ''nākanī''....

which comes out as

::Keep away tum-ti-tum-ti he has fucked me...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
