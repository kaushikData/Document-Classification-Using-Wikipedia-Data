'''Adomnán''' or '''Adamnán of Iona''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|ð|ɒ|v|ˈ|n|ɔː|n}}, {{lang-la|Adamnanus, Adomnanus}}; {{circa}} 624 &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 704), also known as '''Eunan''' ({{etymology|ga|Naomh Ádhamhnán}}), was an [[abbot]] of [[Iona Abbey]] ({{abbr|r.|Reigned}}&amp;nbsp;679–704), [[hagiographer]], statesman, canon jurist, and [[Christian saint|saint]]. He was the author of the most important book on the life of his cousin [[Columba|St&amp;nbsp;Columba]] and the promulgator of the [[Cáin Adomnáin|Law of Adomnán]] or "Law of Innocents" ({{lang-la|Lex Innocentium}}).

==Life==
Adomnán was born about 624, a relative on his father's side of Columba.&lt;ref name=Wetherill&gt;[http://www.heroicage.org/issues/6/wetherill.html Wetherill, Jeffrey. "Adomnán, Iona, and the Life of St. Columba: Their Place Among Continental Saints", ''The Heroic Age'', No. 6, Spring 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Rónán mac Tinne by Ronat, a woman from the [[Northern Uí Néill]] lineage known as the ''Cenél nÉnda''. Adomnán's birthplace was [[Raphoe]], a town in [[County Donegal]] in [[Ulster]]. Some of Adomnán's childhood anecdotes seem to confirm at least an upbringing in this area.

It is thought that Adomnán may have begun his monastic career at a Columban monastery called Druim Tuamma, but any Columban foundation in northern [[Ireland]] or [[Dál Riata]] is a possibility, although Durrow is a stronger possibility than most. He probably joined the Columban ''familia'' (i.e. the federation of monasteries under the leadership of [[Iona Abbey]]) around the year 640. Some modern commentators believe that he could not have come to Iona until sometime after the year 669, the year of the accession of [[Fáilbe mac Pípáin]], the first abbot of whom Adomnán gives any information. However, Richard Sharpe argues that he probably came to Iona during the abbacy of [[Ségéne of Iona|Ségéne]] (d. 652). Whenever or wherever Adomnán received his education, Adomnán attained a level of learning rare in [[Early Middle Ages|Early Medieval]] Northern Europe. It has been suggested by Alfred Smyth that Adomnán spent some years teaching and studying at Durrow,&lt;ref name=smyth&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mxxwmg48bFgC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=St.+Adomn%C3%A1n&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7fC4Ii-zo8&amp;sig=r0d2GfSmks0Fx47bG-Jo7ufZtxY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C3Z9U5L8OtfMsQTHjIKgDg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=St.%20Adomn%C3%A1n&amp;f=false Smyth, Alfred. ''Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000'', Edinburgh University Press, 1984] {{ISBN|9780748601004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while this is not accepted by all scholars, it remains a strong possibility.
 
[[File:Iona Abbey.jpg|right|thumb|305px|[[Iona Abbey]]]]
In 679, Adomnán became the ninth abbot of Iona after Columba.&lt;ref name=grattan&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01135c.htm Grattan-Flood, William. "St. Adamnan." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 11 Mar. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Abbot Adomnán enjoyed a friendship with King [[Aldfrith of Northumbria]]. In 684, Aldfrith had been staying with Adomnán in Iona. In 686, after the death of Aldfrith's brother King [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria]] and Aldfrith's succession to the kingship, Adomnán was in the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] on the request of King [[Fínsnechta Fledach]] of [[Kings of Brega|Brega]] in order to gain the freedom of sixty [[Gaels]] who had been captured in a Northumbrian raid two years before.&lt;ref name=smyth/&gt;

Adomnán, in keeping with Ionan tradition, made several more trips to the lands of the English during his abbacy, including one the following year. It is sometimes thought, after the [[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|account]] given by [[Bede]], that it was during his visits to Northumbria, under the influence of Abbot [[Ceolfrith]], that Adomnán decided to adopt the Roman dating of [[Easter]] that had been agreed some years before at the [[Synod of Whitby]]. Bede implies that this led to a schism at Iona, whereby Adomnán became alienated from the Iona brethren and went to Ireland to convince the Irish of the Roman dating. Jeffrey Wetherill sees Adomnan's long absences from Iona as having led to something of an undermining of his authority; he was thus unable to persuade the monks to adopt the Roman dating of Easter, let alone the tonsure.&lt;ref name=Wetherill/&gt; It is clear that Adomnán did adopt that Roman dating, and moreover, probably did argue the case for it in Ireland.&lt;ref name=grattan/&gt;

==Cain Adomnain==
{{Main article|Cáin Adomnáin}}
It is generally believed that in 697, Adomnán promulgated the ''[[Cáin Adomnáin]]'', meaning literally the "Canons" or "Law of Adomnán". The ''Cáin Adomnáin'' was promulgated amongst a gathering of [[Irish people|Irish]], Dál Riatan and [[Picts|Pictish]] notables at the [[Synod of Birr]]. It is a set of laws designed, among other things, to guarantee the safety and immunity of various types of non-combatants in warfare. For this reason it is also known as the "Law of Innocents".

==Works==
Adomnán's most important work, and the one for which he is best known, is the ''[[Columba#Vita Columbae|Vita Columbae]]'' (i.e. "Life of Columba"), a hagiography of Iona's founder, Saint Columba,&lt;ref name=butler&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/210/9/233.html Butler, Alban. ''The Lives of the Saints'', Vol.IX, 1866]&lt;/ref&gt; probably written between 697 and 700. The format borrows to some extent from Sulpicius Severus' ''Life of Saint Martin of Tours''.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;[http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/nilsson.html#a2Wetherill Nilsson, Sara E. Ellis. "Miracle Stories and the Primary Purpose of Adomnán's ''Vita Columbae''", ''The Heroic Age'', No. 10, May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Adamnan adapted traditional forms of Christian biography to group stories about Columba thematically rather than chronologically,&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Donald A., "Columba, Adomnán and the achievement of Iona: Part I", ''The Scottish Historical Review'',43, pp.111-130, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; and present Columba as comparable to a hero in Gaelic mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Picard, Jean-Michel. "The purpose of Adomnán's Vita Columbae", ''Peritia'', 1, pp.160-177, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Wetherill suggests that one of the motivations for writing the Vita was to offer Columba as a model for the monks, and thereby improve Adomnan's standing as abbot.&lt;ref name=Wetherill/&gt; The biography is by far the most important surviving work written in early medieval Scotland, and is a vital source for our knowledge of the Picts, as well as a great insight into the life of Iona and the early medieval Gaelic monk.

However, the ''Vita'' was not his only work. Adomnán also wrote the treatise ''[[De Locis Sanctis]]'' (i.e. "On Holy Places"), an account of the great Christian holy places and centres of pilgrimage. Adomnán got much of his information from a [[Franks|Frankish]] bishop called [[Arculf]], who had personally visited the [[Egypt]], [[Rome]], [[Constantinople]] and the [[Holy Land]], and visited Iona afterwards. Adomnán gave a copy to the scholar-king [[Aldfrith]] of [[Northumbria]] (685-704).&lt;ref name=smyth/&gt; Also attributed to him is a good deal of Gaelic poetry, including a celebration of the Pictish King [[Bridei III of the Picts|Bridei]]'s (671-93) victory over the Northumbrians at the [[Battle of Dun Nechtain]] (685).

==Death==
Adomnán died in 704, and became a saint in Scottish and Irish tradition, as well as one of the most important figures in either Scottish or Irish history. His death and [[feast day]] are commemorated on 23 September. Along with [[St. Columba]], he is joint patron of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Raphoe|Diocese of Raphoe]], which encompasses the bulk of [[County Donegal]] in the north west of [[Ireland]]. The [[Cathedral of St. Eunan and St Columba|Cathedral of St. Eunan and St. Columba]] (popularly known as St. Eunan's Cathedral), the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[cathedral]] in that diocese, is in [[Letterkenny]].

== Legacy ==
In his native Donegal, the saint has given his name to several institutions and buildings including:
* The [[Cathedral of St. Eunan and St Columba]] in [[Letterkenny]], [[Co. Donegal]]; the current seat of the Bishop of Raphoe,
* The Anglican [[Cathedral Church of St. Eunan]] in [[Raphoe]], Donegal,
* St Eunan's NS, a national school in the town of [[Raphoe]], Donegal,
* [[St Eunan's College]], a secondary school in Letterkenny,
* [[St Eunan's NS]], a national school in the small village of [[Laghey]], just south of [[Donegal Town]],
* [[St Eunan's GAA]], a GAA club in Letterkenny, County Donegal
In Co. Sligo, just to the south, he is venerated as the founder of Skreen Abbey, now the site of the C. of I. church of Skreen Parish.

==History==
In 1911, [[Frederic Goudy]], [[Alfred Stieglitz]], and [[William Addison Dwiggins|W. A. Dwiggins]] came together to discuss the creation of an organization that was committed to individuals passionate about communication design.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://madmuseum.org/series/aiga|title=AIGA|website=madmuseum.org|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, president of the [[National Arts Club]], [[John G. Agar (lawyer)|John G. Agar]], announced the formation of The American Institute of Graphic Arts during the eighth annual exhibition of “The Books of the Year.” The National Arts Club was instrumental in the formation of AIGA in that they helped to form the committee to plan to organize the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/11/13/104788833.html|title=ARTS CLUB WARNED OF 'THOUGHT TRUST'; While It Plans for Graphic Arts, Bacheller Also Warns of Our Europeanization. NEW THEMES FOR NOVELS Getting Away from Work, He Finds Butcher's Daughter Cultivates Only Ease and the Graces Now.|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee formed included [[Charles DeKay]] and [[William Bailey Howland|William B. Howland]] and officially formed the American Institute of Graphic Arts in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aiga.org/How-Our-Quarter-Century-Began/|title=How Our Quarter Century Began|newspaper=AIGA {{!}} the professional association for design|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howland, publisher and editor of ''The Outlook'', was elected president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Steven Heller|author2=Nathan Gluck|title=Seventy-five years of AIGA|url=http://www.aiga.org/about-history-75thanniversary/|website=aiga.org|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the group was to promote excellence in the graphic design profession through its network of local chapters throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1920, AIGA began awarding [[List of AIGA medalists|medals]] to "individuals who have set standards of excellence over a lifetime of work or have made individual contributions to innovation within the practice of design." Winners have been recognized for design, teaching, writing or leadership of the profession and may honor individuals posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aiga.org/medal|title=AIGA Medalists List|newspaper=AIGA {{!}} the professional association for design|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the New York Chapter was formed and the organization began creating local chapters to decentralize leadership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Represented by Washington, D.C. arts advocate and attorney, James Lorin Silverberg, Esq., The Washington, D.C. Chapter of AIGA, was organized as the American Institute of Graphic Arts, Incorporated, Washington, D.C. on September 6, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=District of Columbia Corporate Records|url=http://corp.dcra.dc.gov/BizEntity.aspx/ViewEntityData?entityld=2787251|publisher=The District of Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbol sign project==
{{main article|DOT pictograms}}
The AIGA, in collaboration with the [[US Department of Transportation]], produced 50 standard symbols to be used on signs "in airports and other transportation hubs and at large international events". The first 34 symbols were published in 1974, receiving  a [[Presidential Design Award]]. The remaining 16 designs were added in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/symbol-signs|title=Symbol Signs|year=2009|publisher=AIGA|accessdate=September 2, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091010215420/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/symbol-signs| archivedate= October 10, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual competitions ==

===Cased===
In 2012, AIGA replaced all its competitions with a single competition called "Cased"&lt;ref name="Cased-competition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/cased/|title=Cased, AIGA's annual design competition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly called "Justified"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/justified/#about |title=Justified: AIGA Annual Design Competition |author=AIGA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The stated aim of the competition is to demonstrate "the collective success and impact of the design profession by celebrating the best in contemporary design through case studies".&lt;ref name="Cased-competition" /&gt;

===50 Books/50 Covers===
Between 1941 and 2011 AIGA sponsored a juried contest for the 50 best designed books published in the previous year, entitled "50 Books/50 Covers". Jurors included booksellers, book publishers, and designers such as [[George Salter]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Books of the year 1963'', The American Institute of Graphic Arts, New York, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2012, AIGA announced that it would cease organizing the contest and that future contests would be organized by [[Design Observer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/AIGA-and-Design-Observer-partner-on-50-Books-50-Covers/ |title=AIGA and Design Observer Partner on "50 Books/50 Covers" |date=February 17, 2012 |author=AIGA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This move has been criticized.&lt;ref name=Unjustified&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.printmag.com/featured/aiga-unjustified/ |title=AIGA: Unjustified |first=Paula |last=Scher |authorlink=Paula Scher |work=[[Print (magazine)|Print Magazine]] |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===365===
The 365 was an annual design competition for all graphic design other than book design.&lt;ref name=Unjustified /&gt; The last “365” competition was organized in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/about-365/ |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;365 | Design Effectiveness Competition&lt;/nowiki&gt; |author=AIGA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after which it was replaced by the "Cased" competition.

==Conferences==
AIGA organized two conferences, the AIGA Design Conference and GAIN: AIGA Design and Business Conference. Both conferences were held biennially and the two were held in alternating years. Beginning in 2016, the AIGA Design Conference will be held annually with the 2016 conference held in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designconference.aiga.org/#!/|title=AIGA Design Conference|website=designconference.aiga.org|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AIGA Design Conference===

The first AIGA Design Conference took place in Boston, Massachusetts in 1985.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8780">'''Autonomy''' and '''heteronomy''' are complementary attributes of a [[language variety]] describing its functional relationship with related varieties.
The concepts were introduced by [[William Alexander Stewart|William A. Stewart]] in 1968, and provide a way of distinguishing a ''language'' from a ''dialect''.{{sfnp|Stewart|1968|p=535}}

== Definitions ==

A variety is said to be '''autonomous''' if it has an independent cultural status.
This may occur if the variety is structurally different from all others, a situation [[Heinz Kloss]] called ''[[Abstand and ausbau languages#Abstand languages|abstand]]''.{{sfnp|Stewart|1968|p=535}}{{sfnp|Trudgill|2004|p=36}}
Thus [[language isolate]]s such as [[Basque language|Basque]] are necessarily autonomous.{{sfnp|Trudgill|2004|p=36}}
Where several closely related varieties are found together, a [[standard language]] is autonomous because it has its own orthography, dictionaries, grammar books and literature.{{sfnp|Trudgill|2004|p=36}}
In the terminology of Heinz Kloss, these are the attributes of ''[[Abstand and ausbau languages#Ausbau languages|ausbau]]'', or the elaboration of a language to serve as a literary standard.{{sfnp|Trudgill|2004|p=36}}

A variety is said to be '''heteronomous''' with respect to a [[language family|genetically related]] standardized variety if speakers read and write the other variety, which they consider the standard form of their speech, and any standardizing changes in their speech are towards that standard.{{sfnp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=9}}
In such cases, the heteronomous variety is said to be dependent on, or oriented towards, the autonomous one.
In the terminology of Heinz Kloss, the heteronomous varieties are said to be under the "roof" of the standard variety.{{sfnp|Ammon|2004|p=280}}
For example, the various [[German dialects|regional varieties of German]] (so called "dialects"), such as [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]], [[Austro-Bavarian]], Central, Eastern and Northern [[Hessian dialects|Hessian]], [[Colognian language|Kölsch]], [[Low German]], and more, are heteronomous with respect to [[Standard German]], even though many of them are not mutually intelligible.{{sfnp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=4}}

[[File:West Germanic dialect diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Local dialects of the West Germanic continuum are oriented towards either Standard Dutch or Standard German depending on which side of the border they are spoken.{{sfnp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|pp=9–10}}]]
A [[dialect continuum]] may be partitioned by these dependency relationships, which are often determined by extra-linguistic factors.
For example, although Germanic varieties spoken on either side of the Dutch–German border are very similar, those spoken in the [[Netherlands]] are oriented towards Standard [[Dutch language|Dutch]], whereas those spoken in [[Germany]] are oriented towards [[Standard German]].{{sfnp|Trudgill|1992|p=169}}

Within this framework, a ''language'' may be defined as an autonomous variety together with all the varieties that are heteronomous with respect to it.{{sfnp|Stewart|1968|p=535}}{{sfnp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=11}}
Stewart noted that an essentially equivalent definition had been stated by [[Charles A. Ferguson]] and [[John J. Gumperz]] in 1960.{{sfnp|Stewart|1968|p=535}}{{sfnp|Ferguson|Gumperz|1960|p=5}}
In these terms, [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], though mutually intelligible to a large degree, are considered separate languages.{{sfnp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=11}}
Conversely, although the [[varieties of Chinese]] are mutually unintelligible and have significant differences in phonology, syntax and vocabulary, they may be viewed as comprising a single language because they are all heteronomous with respect to [[Standard Chinese]].{{sfnp|Bisang|2004|p=13}}
Similarly, a heteronomous variety may be considered a ''dialect'' of a language defined in this way.{{sfnp|Stewart|1968|p=535}}

== Change of status ==

Autonomy and heteronomy are largely [[political sociology|sociopolitical]] constructs rather than the result of intrinsic linguistic differences, and thus may change over time.{{sfnp|Trudgill|1992|p=169}}

Heteronomous varieties may become dependent on a different standard as a result of social or political changes.
For example, the [[Scanian dialects]] spoken at the southern tip of [[Sweden]], were considered dialects of [[Danish language|Danish]] when the area was part of the kingdom of [[Denmark]].
A few decades after the area was transferred to Sweden, these varieties were generally regarded as dialects of Swedish, although the dialects themselves had not changed.{{sfnp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|pp=9–11}}

Efforts to achieve autonomy are often connected with [[nationalist]] movements and the establishment of [[nation state]]s.{{sfnp|Trudgill|2004|pp=35, 46}}
Examples of varieties that have gained autonomy are [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] from [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], which was formerly considered a dialect of [[Dutch language|Dutch]].{{sfnp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|pp=7, 11}}

Examples of languages that have previously been considered to be autonomous but are now sometimes considered heteronomous are [[Occitan language|Occitan]], sometimes considered a dialect of [[French language|French]], and [[Low German]], occasionally considered to be a dialect of [[German language|German]].{{sfnp|Trudgill|1992|p=169}}

'''Axel Anders Theodor Hägerström''' (6 September 1868, [[Vireda]] – 7 July 1939, [[Uppsala]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[philosopher]].

Born in [[Vireda]], [[Jönköping County]], [[Sweden]], he was the son of a [[Church of Sweden]] pastor. As student at [[Uppsala University]], he gave up theology for a career in philosophy. Teaching there from 1893 until his retirement in 1933, he attacked the then dominant philosophical idealism of the followers of [[Christopher Jacob Boström]] (1797-1866). He is best known as a founder of the (quasi-) positivistic Uppsala school of philosophy&amp;mdash;the Swedish counterpart of the Anglo-American Analytical Philosophy as well as of the Logical Positivism of the Vienna Circle&amp;mdash;and as the founder of the Scandinavian legal realism movement.

Some of his work was published by the [[Muirhead Library of Philosophy]].

He was [[Inspektor]] of the [[Östgöta nation (Uppsala)|Östgöta nation]] from 1925 to his retirement in 1933.

==Contribution to legal understanding==

The jurisprudential camp of [[legal realism]], broadly speaking, consists of those scholars who strictly reject the concept of natural law and who believe that legal concepts, terminology and values should be based on experience, observation and experimentation and are thus, ‘real’.

Hägerström is considered to be the founding father of the Scandinavian school of legal realism.  His disciples [[Karl Olivecrona]], [[Alf Ross]] and [[Anders Vilhelm Lundstedt]] all take a similar basic view to Hägerström in their opinions on the language of [[Western law]]. Due to their verdict on natural law, they also reject the concept of [[human rights]].

Hägerström, who had been influenced by the Neo-Kantianism of the [[University of Marburg|Marburg]] school, rejected [[metaphysics]] in their entirety. His motto was: "Praeterea censeo metaphysicam esse delendam", [[paraphrase|paraphrasing]] [[Cato the Elder|Cato's]] famous "[[Carthago delenda est|delenda Carthago]]". His opinion was that words such as ‘right’ and ‘duty’ were basically meaningless as they could not be scientifically verified or proven.  They may have influence or be able to direct a person who obtains such a right or duty but ultimately, if they could not stand up to a factual test, they were mere fantasies. Similarly, Hägerström regarded all value judgements as mere emotional expressions using the form of judgements without being judgments in the proper sense of the word. This position caused Hägerström's critics to characterize his philosophy as "value nihilism"  -  a label that was invented by journalists and later endorsed by some of Hägerström's less orthodox followers, namely [[Ingemar Hedenius]].

Hägerström attacked various words and legal concepts in his writings so as to prove they could not stand up to scientific application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3014">'''Bernat Manciet''' ({{IPA-oc|beɾˈnad manˈsjet|lang}}; 27 September 1923, [[Sabres, Landes]], France – 3 June 2005, [[Mont-de-Marsan]]) was a famous [[Occitan]] author.

==Biography==
Manciet attended school first in his native Sabres and then spent three years in the ''[[lycée]]'' of [[Talence]] where he lived at his uncles', who were priests. They taught him [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]. He went on to sit his ''[[baccalauréat]]'' in [[Bordeaux]] on a Sunday of June, 1940. His education provided him with an incredible erudition that transpired from his every words. As [[World War II]] broke out, Manciet started studying literature and political sciences.

This is how he became a [[diplomacy|diplomat]] with [[Marie-Pierre Kœnig]], who was a high commissioner in Germany at a time when the defeated nation was trying to rebuild itself. He also took part in the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. In 1955, his diplomatic career led him to such places as [[Brazil]] and [[Montevideo]] in [[Uruguay]], where his acute geopolitical skills probably sprang from. Back in the Landes, he got wed, fathered five children and ran his step-family's company, only for it to go bankrupt after ten years.

Bernat Manciet managed ''Òc'' magazine but always refused to side with such Occitan activists as [[Robèrt Lafont]] and [[Max Roqueta]], with whom he nonetheless was quite friendly.

==Literary career==
A poet, a novelist, a playwright, an [[essay]]ist, a literary review director, an artist... Bernat Manciet also came on stage to recite his poems and even took part in shows alongside Bernard Lubat in Uzeste.

In 1972 already, [[Renat Nelli]] wrote about Manciet in a bilingual collection of poems called ''La Poésie occitane'' (published by Seghers): 
:"One won't have long to wait before an overall study of Manciet's work is made. Maybe it will help understand better this giant of originality, whose unremitting literary renewal and lyrical intimate spring have no cause to be jealous of the latest Parisian trends. With [[René Char]] and [[Salvatore Quasimodo]], Bernat Manciet is undoubtedly one of the great and underrated poets of modern Europe."

The '''Bit–Khang languages''' consist of:&lt;ref name="Sidwell2014"/&gt;
*''Bit'' cluster: [[Bit language|Bit]] (a.k.a. Khabit, Psing, Buxing) and [[Quang Lam language|Quang Lam]]
*''Khang'' cluster: [[Kháng language|Kháng]] and [[Bumang language|Bumang]]

The Bit–Khang languages are spoken in southern China, northern Laos, and northwestern Vietnam. The Bit-Khang branch was first proposed by [[Paul Sidwell]] (2014)&lt;ref name="Sidwell2014"/&gt;.

==Classification==
At first, Bit-Khang languages were usually classified as [[Khmuic languages|Khmuic]], but Sidwell (2014)&lt;ref name="Sidwell2014"/&gt; has since demonstrated the Palaungic affiliation of Bit-Khang, as well as its unity. [[Paul Sidwell]] (2014)&lt;ref name="Sidwell2014"&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2014. "[https://www.academia.edu/11935141/Khmuic_classification_and_homeland Khmuic classification and homeland]". ''Mon-Khmer Studies'' 43.1:47-56.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that these languages constitute a subgroup of [[Palaungic languages|Palaungic]], since they display lexical innovations characteristic of the Palaungic branch such as 'eye', 'fire', 'blood', and 'laugh'.

Sidwell (2014) speculates that Bit–Khang may have originally been Eastern Palaungic, due to various isoglosses shared with [[Waic languages|Waic]], [[Lamet language|Lametic]], and [[Angkuic languages|Angkuic]], but was later heavily relexified by [[Khmuic languages|Khmuic]] as Bit-Khang speakers migrated eastward into Khmuic territory.

'''Corneous''' is a biological and [[medical term]] meaning '''horny''', in other words made out of a substance similar to that of [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s and [[hooves]] in some [[mammal]]s. 

The word is generally used to describe natural or pathological anatomical structures made out of a hard layer of [[protein]]. In mammals this protein would usually be [[keratin]].

The word corneous is also often used to describe the [[Operculum (gastropod)|operculum]] of a [[snail]], a [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]. Not all gastropods have opercula, but in the great majority of those that do have one, the operculum is corneous. (However in several genera within a few families including the marine [[Naticidae]] and the terrestrial [[Pomatiidae]], the operculum is primarily [[calcareous]], in other words mostly made of [[calcium carbonate]].) Corneous opercula are made out of the protein [[conchiolin]].

'''Corpora in Translation Studies'''
Gradually the translator’s workplace has changed over the last ten years. Personal computers now have the capacity to process information easier and quicker than ever before, and so today's computer could be considered an important or even essential tool in translation. However, problems arise in the use of computers in translation, as the computer is no substitute for traditional tools such as [[monolingual]] and [[Bilingual dictionary|bilingual dictionaries]], [[Terminology|terminologies]] and [[encyclopaedia]]s on paper or in digital format and although we can easily access a large amount of information, we need to find the right and reliable information.

Here Corpora and concordancing software play an important role since gaining access to information about language, content and translation practices which was hardly available to translators before the present stage of ICT development.

== Machine Translation based on Corpus ==
Machine translation from corpus linguistics is based in the analysis of real samples with its own translations. Among the different devices that use corpus, there are statistical methods and based on examples.

=== Statistical Methods ===
The main objective of statistic machine translation is to generate translations from statistical methods based in corpus of bilingual texts. For instance European parliament minutes are written in all EU ([[European Union]]) official languages. If there were more of this corpus, we would get excellent results of translation of texts about those subjects.  
The first statistic machine translation program was CANDIDE by [[IBM]].

=== Based on examples ===
Machine translation based on examples is well known for using a bilingual corpus as the main source of knowledge. Basically it’s an analogical translation and could be interpreted as a practice of cases reasoning used in automatic learning, which consists in solving a problem basing on solutions of others similar problems.

== Corpora and Translation ==

=== Translation typology ===
According to EAGLES, we can make a general distinction between Monolingual and Multilingual corpora. At the same time in multilingual corpora, we can distinguish between Comparable corpora and Corpora compiled using similar design criteria but which are not translations.

Parallel or Translation corpora are texts in one language aligned with their translation in another. We have to take into account several variables like directness of translation, number of languages, etc.

There are many Monolingual Comparable Corpora (corpus composed in two sub-sections, one of original texts in one language and the other texts translated into the same language). It’s useful for translation theorists and researchers but professional technical translators use translation memories.

=== Defining Translation memories===
[[Translation memory]] is a very specific  type of parallel corpus in that:

# It is “propietory”: TMs are created individually or collectively around specific translation projects.
# TMs tend to be closure. They are standardized and have a restricted range of linguistic options.

Translation workbenches and TMs could be considered the most successful translation tool; however it’s restricted to specific text types.

== Corpora aids in Translation ==
The previous kinds of corpora can be combined with other tools like a dictionary for example. Corpora can function as general or specialized dictionaries. In that way, [[Comparable corpora]] can be seen as a [[Monolingual learner's dictionary|monolingual dictionary]] and Parallel corpora could be compared to a [[bilingual dictionary]].

== Corpus resources for Translators ==
Not all dictionaries are the same, and neither are all corpora.
Apart from translation memories, corpus resources with a potential use for professional translators could be classified from “robust” to “virtual”.

Some examples of corpora could be BNC ([[British National Corpus]]) or the Spanish corpus CREA or the Italian CORIS and so on.

It’s important to mention the difference by [[corpus linguistics]] between corpora and archives of electronic texts; the second one is only a repertory of electronic texts.
Building a corpus of web pages implies an [[information retrieval]] operation, in order to locate relevant and reliable documents.

In many translation classes students have made their own corpora with [[DIY]] (do it yourself) corpora.  
The main benefits of DIY corpora may be summarized as follows: 
* They are easy to make.
* They are a great resource for content information.
* They are a great resource for terminology and phraseology.
* Not all topics, not all types and not all languages are available.
* The relevance and reliability of documents needs to be carefully assessed.
* Existing concordance software isn’t well equipped for HTML or XML files.

Finally the advantages of “robust” corpora that we can see over “virtual” corpora are the following:
* They are usually more reliable
* They are usually larger.
* They may be improved with linguistic and contextual information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">In Latin and Greek poetry, '''correption''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|p|ʃ|ə|n}}; {{lang-la|correptiō}} {{IPA-la|korˈreptɪoː|}}, "a shortening")&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|correptio|correptio|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is the shortening of a [[long vowel]] at the end of one word before a [[short vowel]] at the beginning of the next.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanford|first=W.B.|title=Homer: Odyssey I-XII|year=2009|publisher=Duckworth|isbn=1853995029|pages=lv|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZyEJAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=stanford+odyssey+i-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vowels next to each other in neighboring words are in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]].

[[Homer]] uses correption in [[dactylic hexameter]]:

* Ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, Μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ&lt;br&gt;πλάγχθ'''η, ἐ'''πεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσε·&lt;br&gt;— [[Odyssey]] {{Odyssey|1|1|2}}
* Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many devices, who wandered full&lt;br&gt;many ways after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy.&lt;br&gt;— [http://www.perseus-tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.10.1036:book=1:card=1 translation by A.T. Murray]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

Here the sequence η ε in bold must be pronounced as ε ε to preserve the ''long—short—short'' [[syllable weight#Classical poetry|syllable weight]] sequence of a [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]]. Thus, the scansion of the second line is thus:

{{color|steelblue|'''πλαγχ θε,}} {{color|darkgreen|ε'''}} &amp;#124; {{color|darkgreen|πει}} {{color|saddlebrown|Τρο ι}} &amp;#124; {{color|saddlebrown|η ς}}{{color|steelblue|ι ε}} &amp;#124; {{color|steelblue|ρον}} {{color|darkgreen|πτο λι}} &amp;#124; {{color|darkgreen|εθ ρο ν}}{{color|saddlebrown|ε}} &amp;#124; {{color|saddlebrown|περ σε}}

==Attic==

Typically, in Homeric meter, a [[syllable]] is scanned long or "[[Syllable#Coda|closed]]" when a vowel is followed by two or more consonants. However, in [[Attic Greek]], a short vowel followed by a [[plosive]] and a [[liquid consonant]] or [[nasal stop]] remains a short or "[[Syllable#Coda|open]]" syllable.&lt;ref name=Smyth&gt;{{cite book|last=Smyth|first=Herbert|title=Greek Grammar|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674362500|pages=35|url=https://books.google.com/?id=M3EyjIa6IPgC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=0674362500#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is called '''Attic Correption'''.

Therefore, the first syllable of a word like δάκρυ (ᾰ) could be scanned as "δά &amp;#124; κρυ" (open/short), exhibiting Attic correption, or as "δάκ &amp;#124; ρυ" (closed/long), in keeping with the conventions of Homeric verse.

The '''deck department''' is an organisational team on board [[navy|naval]] and [[merchant ship|merchant]] ships.  The department and its manning requirements, including the responsibilities of each rank are regulated within the [[STCW Convention]].&lt;ref name="STCW"&gt;{{cite book |title=Standards of Training and Certification of Watchkeeping’ (STCW) Convention |publisher= [[International Maritime Organization]]|date= 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The department is led by '''deck officers''', who are [[licensed mariner]]s and they are commanded overall by the ship's [[sea captain|captain]]. Seafarers in the deck department work a variety of jobs on a ship or vessel, but primarily they will carry out the [[navigation]] of a vessel, from the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. However, they are usually also responsible for supervising and monitoring any maritime [[cargo]] onboard, as well as ensuring maintenance of the [[deck (ship)|deck]] and upper [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] structure, monitoring the [[ship stability|stability]] of the ship including loading and discharging [[ballast water discharge and the environment|ballast water]],  carrying out [[mooring (watercraft)|mooring operations]] and finally [[anchor|anchoring]] a ship.

==Merchant shipping==
The deck department is divided into deck officers and ratings. All ranks in the deck department are required to have undertaken training in accordance with the STCW Convention.&lt;ref name="STCW"/&gt; For officers this involves the passing of an exam to receive a [[licensed mariner|certificate of competency]], the level of understanding and certification varies according to ship size. All ranks are required to have undertaken generic maritime training, which usually involves time at sea and time in an approved college. International standards under the STCW Code set out the minimum requirements for training, however individual nations also have their own maritime training regulations. For example, in the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] ensure that the deck department receive training and examinations in order to assume the responsibilities of their rank at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-uk-seafarer-coc-deck-and-engineer-officers |title=Certificates of Competency |publisher=[[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] |access-date=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All seafarers of the deck department are also required to have undertaken a series of short course training, in various elements under the STCW Convention.&lt;ref name=STCWManilla&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warsashacademy.co.uk/courses/stcw-safety-and-security/stcw-2010-manila-amendments.aspx |title=STCW 2010 Manilla Requirements |publisher=[[Warsash Maritime Academy]] |access-date=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes general security, safety and lifeboat training, as well as vessel-specific training, such as operations in the [[polar regions]] and on [[tanker (ship)|tankers]].&lt;ref name=STCWManilla/&gt;

While the [[sea captain|master or captain]] is in overall command of the ship, the [[chief mate]] is the head of the deck department.  This involves administrative tasks such as scheduling work, quality control, coordinating with other departments, and conflict resolution.  The chief mate also compiles supply, overtime, and cost control records, and requisitions or purchases stores and equipment.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Depending on the number of officers carried, he may or may not be a [[watch officer]]. If the ship carries a second mate and two third mates, he will be a dayworker, with a duty day from 0800 to 1700 ship's time. If only one third mate is carried, he will stand the 4 to 8 watch in addition to handling his executive duties.

The ship's other deck officers, generally a second mate and third mate, are also members of the deck department. Each watchstanding officer is responsible for the unlicensed crewmen on his watch.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In a four-mate ship where the chief mate is a dayworker, the second mate will stand the 4 to 8 watch, because sunrise and sunset usually fall on that watch. In the days before satellite navigation systems, the second mate shot morning and evening star fixes to determine the ship's position. The second mate is also responsible for maintaining the ship's charts and navigational publications, the ship's gyrocompass, and all navigational gear. He also keeps the log extract for each voyage used by company management as a short form "howgozit" sheet, covering time at sea, time under pilotage, time in port, and types and tonnages of cargoes moved.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The two third mates are often called the senior third and the junior third. The senior third mate stands the 12 to 4 watch, the junior third the 8 to 12 watch. While on duty, they are responsible for handling the ship and fixing its position by shooting sun lines, taking hourly fixes from the satellite navigation gear, and piloting the ship in coastal waters; and the senior third will prepare the noon position slip for the use of the captain and chief engineer.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Naval usage==

In the military, the deck department comprises [[sailors]] who perform a variety of functions depending on ship type and size.

Examples include maintenance and upkeep of the ship, handling of the ship's rigging and [[ground tackle]], coordination of [[underway replenishment]] operations, conductance of [[naval mine#Mine sweeping|minesweeping]] operations, maintenance and operation of the ship's boats, supervision of diving and salvage operations (including towing), and serving as shipboard seamanship specialists.  Undesignated seamen, or those who have not selected a [[list of United States Navy ratings|rating]] (e.g. job or vocation), are normally the most junior sailors on board and are usually sent to the deck department for their first assignment.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''Digital dictation''' is a method of recording and editing the spoken word in real-time. The recording is done by the use of a digital recorder. Digital recorders are lighter, have a longer battery life and are able to record for a lot longer utilizing the same media, as compared to analog tape based dictation machines. The files generated with digital recorders vary in size, depending on the manufacturer and the format the user chooses. The most common file formats that digital recorders generate have one of the extensions WAV, WMA or MP3. True dictation machines record in the [[Digital Speech Standard|DSS]] and DS2 format.

The DSS and DS2 file formats compress audio allowing for greater portability. In some cases, speech is recorded where sound quality is paramount and transcription unnecessary, e.g. for [[broadcasting]] a [[theatre play]]; such recording uses techniques closer to [[high-fidelity]] music recording, rather than those discussed here.

Digital dictation offers several advantages over traditional [[cassette tape]] based dictation:

* The user can instantly rewind or fast forward to any point within the dictation file to review or edit.
* The [[random access]] ability of [[digital audio]] allows inserting audio at any point without overwriting the following text.
* Dictation produces a [[audio file|file]] which can be [[file transfer|transferred]] [[Electronics|electronically]], e.g. via [[Wide Area Network|WAN]], [[local area network|LAN]], [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[e-mail]], [[telephony]], [[BlackBerry]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], etc.
* Large dictation files can be shared with multiple typists.
* Sound may be [[CD quality]] and can improve transcription accuracy and speed{{Citation needed|date=July 2009|reason=Does high-quality wideband sound improve accuracy or speed?}}.
* Digital dictation provides the ability to report on the volume or type of dictation and transcription outstanding or completed within an organization.

Dictation audio can be recorded in various [[audio file format]]s. Most digital dictation systems use a [[lossy]] form of [[audio data compression|audio compression]] based on modelling of the vocal tract to minimize [[hard disk]] space and optimize network utilization as files are transferred between users. (Note that [[WAV]] is not an audio encoding format, but a file format and has little or no bearing on the encoding rate ([[Data rate units#Kilobit per second|kbit/s]]), size or audio quality of the resulting file.)

Digital dictation is different from [[speech recognition]] where audio is analyzed by a computer using speech algorithms in an attempt to [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribe]] the document. With digital dictation the process of converting digital audio to text may be done using digital transcription software, typically controlled by a foot switch which allows the transcriber to PLAY, STOP, REWIND, and BACKSPACE.

These days there are Digital Transcription Kits that allow integration with Speech Recognition Software. This gives the typist the option to either type a document manually, or send a document to be converted to text by Software such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

==Methods==
'''Portable Recorder'''&lt;br&gt;
Portable, hand held, digital recorders are the modern replacement for analog handhelds. Digital portables allow transfer of recordings by docking or plugging into a computer.  Digital recorders eliminate the need for cassette tapes.  Professional digital hand held recorders are available with slide switch, push button, fingerprint locking, and barcode scanning options.

'''Computer'''&lt;br&gt;
Another common way to record digital dictation is with a computer dictation microphone. There are several different types of computer dictation microphones available, but each one has similar features and operation. Olympus Direct Rec, Philips SpeechMike, and Dictaphone Powermic are all digital computer dictation microphones that also feature push button control for operating dictation or speech recognition software. The dictation microphone operates through a [[USB]] port on the computer it is used with.

'''Call-in Dictation System'''&lt;br&gt; 
Call in dictation systems allow one to record their dictations over the phone. With call in dictation systems, the author dials a phone number, enters a PIN and starts dictating. Touch tone controls allow for start, pause, playback, and sending of dictation audio file.  The call in dictation systems usually feature a Pod that can be plugged into a phone line. The pod can then be plugged into a computer to store dictation audio recording in compatible transcription or management software.

'''Mobile Phone'''&lt;br&gt;
Currently there are several digital dictation applications available for mobile phones.  With mobile dictation apps, one can record, edit, and send dictation files over networks.  Wireless transfer of dictation files decreases turnaround time. Mobile dictation applications allow users to stay connected to dictation workflows through a network, such as the Internet.

==Types of software==
There are two types of digital dictation software:
#Standalone digital sound recording software: Basic software whereby the audio is recorded as a simple file. Most digital sound recording applications are designed for individuals or a very small number of users, as they do not offer a network efficient way of transferring the audio files other than email, they also do not encrypt or password protect the audio file
#Digital dictation workflow software: Advanced software for commercial organizations where audio is still played by a typist but the audio file can be securely and efficiently transferred. The [[workflow]] element of these advanced systems also allows users to share audio files instantly, create virtual teams, outsource transcription securely, and set up confidential send options or 'ethical walls'. Digital Dictation workflow software is normally [[Active Directory]] integrated and can be used in conjunction with [[Document management system|document]], [[Law practice management software|practice]] or [[Legal case management|case management systems]]. Typical businesses using workflow software are law firms, healthcare organizations, accountancies, or surveying firms.

Recordings can be made over the telephone, on a computer or via a [[Mobile device|hand held dictation device]] that is "[[docking station|dock]]ed" to a computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">'''Extended Channel Interpretation''' (ECI) is an embedded piece of information in a [[bar code]] symbol that tells the [[bar code reader]] details about the used references for encoding the [[data]] in the symbol. The bar code reader uses this information to automatically select the matching options to [[encoding|decode]] the symbol accordingly.

ECI is a [[symbology]]-independent extension of the Global Label Identifier (GLI) system in the [[PDF417]] barcode. It allows usually unsupported [[national character]] sets such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], or [[Japanese language|Japanese]] to be used in barcode symbols. In theory, a barcode symbol could use several character sets by embedding several ECI codes.

As the ECI information is not intended to be part of the bar code "data," it should be transparent when the symbol is scanned.  When encoding a symbol, ECI is a switch, or tick-box, to be checked, followed by a symbology-dependent ECI selection. The ECI information will be encoded in a symbology-specific [[codeword]] that the decoder will recognize and interpret accordingly.

In Basic Channel Mode, the ECI control information is not transmitted from the reader to the host system. In Extended Channel Mode, both the ECI control information and the data are transmitted to the [[host system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2332">In [[phrase structure grammar]]s, such as [[generalised phrase structure grammar]], [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]] and [[lexical functional grammar]], a '''feature structure''' is essentially a set of [[attribute–value pair]]s. For example, the attribute named ''number'' might have the value ''singular''. The value of an attribute may be either [[Lisp atom|atomic]], e.g. the symbol ''singular'', or complex (most commonly a feature structure, but also a list or a set).

A feature structure can be represented as a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG), with the nodes corresponding to the variable values and the paths to the variable names. Operations defined on feature structures, e.g. [[semantic unification|unification]], are used extensively in phrase structure grammars. In most theories (e.g. [[HPSG]]), operations are strictly speaking defined over equations describing feature structures and not over feature structures themselves, though feature structures are usually used in informal exposition.

Often, feature structures are written like this:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} \mbox{category} &amp; noun\ phrase\\ \mbox{agreement} &amp; \begin{bmatrix} \mbox{number} &amp; singular \\ \mbox{person} &amp; third \end{bmatrix} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Here there are the two features ''category'' and ''agreement''. ''Category'' has the value ''noun phrase'' whereas the value of ''agreement'' is indicated by another feature structure with the features ''number'' and ''person'' being ''singular'' and ''third''.

This particular notation is called  ''attribute value matrix'' (AVM).

The [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] has two columns, one for the feature names and the other for the values. In this sense a feature structure is a list of key-value pairs. The value might be atomic or another feature structure.  This leads to another notation for feature structures: the use of [[Tree (data structure)|tree]]s. In fact, some systems (such as [[PATR-II]]) use [[S-expression]]s to represent feature structures.

[[File:Berlin- Light control room at the main hall in the Konzerthaus - 4195.jpg|thumbnail|Light control room]]
In the performing arts, '''front of house''' (FOH) is the part of a performance venue that is open to the public. In [[theater (structure)|theatres]] and live [[music venue]]s, it consists of the [[auditorium]] and [[foyer]]s, as opposed to the [[stage (theatre)|stage]] and [[parts of a theatre#Backstage of offstage|backstage]] areas. In a theatre, the front of house manager is responsible for ticket sales, refreshments, and making sure the auditorium is set out properly.

== Live venues ==
[[Audio engineering|Sound]] operators, excluding the monitor engineers, are normally positioned in a small sectioned-off area front-of-house, surrounded by the audience or at the edge of the audience area. From this position they have unobstructed listening and a clear view of the performance, enabling the operation of the main speaker system, [[show control]] consoles and other equipment. In this case "front of house" can refer to both the general audience/public area or to the specific small section from where the show is mixed.

The front of house speakers are the main speakers that cover the audience, and the front of house desk is the desk that generates the front of house audio mix. In smaller venues the front of house desk may also produce [[foldback (sound engineering)|foldback]] (monitor) mixes for the monitor speakers onstage, whereas in larger venues there will normally be a second mixing desk for monitor control positioned just off the side of the main stage. The audio engineer that designs the front of house sound system and puts it into place for the show/event is the system engineer, and this role is often separate from the person who operates the mixing desk who is often employed by the band directly on larger tours or employed by the venue for smaller tours. The touring engineer is usually assisted by a house sound engineer (employed by the venue) who will be familiar with the installed system of the venue.

In stage lighting, any lighting fixtures that are on the audience side of the [[proscenium arch]] are referred to as being FOH. The lighting operator may also be located in the audience area as well, but are often in a [[lighting booth]].

This term can also refer to the individuals whose primary work is dealing with patrons, including [[House management|house managers]], ticket vendors, bartenders, merchandise vendors, [[Usher (occupation)|usher]]s, and [[museum attendant]]s.

The Egyptian god Hu was one of the minor gods in some respects, but he was one of the most important gods for those serious about Egyptian deities. Hu is the power of the spoken word. He personifies the authority of utterance.

[[File:Nepret, Renenutet and Hu as cobras (KV11).jpg|thumb|Hu and Renenutet]]

Hu is mentioned already in the [[Old Kingdom]] [[Pyramid texts]] (PT 251, PT 697) as companion of the deceased [[pharaoh]]. Together with [[Sia (god)|Sia]], he was depicted in the retinue of [[Thoth]], with whom he was also occasionally identified.

In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], all gods participated in Hu and Sia, and were associated with [[Ptah]] who created the universe by uttering the word of creation. Hu was depicted in human shape, as a falcon, or as a man with a ram's head.

In the [[New Kingdom]], both Hu and Sia together with [[Heka (god)|Heke]], [[Irer]] and [[Sedjem]] were members of the fourteen creative powers of [[Amun-Ra]]. By the time of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], Hu had merged with [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] (air).

==Origins==

The word hypocognition (and its opposite, [[hypercognition]]) was coined by American [[psychiatrist]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Robert I. Levy|Robert Levy]] in his 1973 book ''Tahitians: Mind and Experience in the Society Islands''. After 26 months of studying them, Levy described [[Tahitians]] as having no words to describe sorrow or guilt, resulting in people who had suffered personal losses describing themselves as feeling sick or strange instead of sad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Robert I.|title=Tahitians: mind and experience in the Society Islands|year=1975|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226476073|page=324|edition=Pbk. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Richard A. |editor-last=Shweder |title=Culture theory: essays on mind, self, and emotion |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521318319 |pages=227–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy believed the Tahitians' lack of frames for thinking about and expressing grief contributed to their high suicide rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ottenheimer|first=Harriet Joseph|title=The anthropology of language: an introduction to linguistic anthropology|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0495508845|page=41|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that a balance between hypercognition and hypocognition was culturally most desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferrara|first=Nadia|title=Emotional expression among Cree Indians: the role of pictorial representations in the assessment of psychological mindedness|year=1998|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|location=London|isbn=1853026565|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

Hypocognition is a phrase commonly used in linguistics. In 2004 [[George Lakoff]] used it to describe political [[progressives]] in the United States, saying that relative to conservatives they suffer from "massive hypocognition," which he described as the lack of having a progressive philosophy framed around the progressive core values of empathy and responsibility such as "effective government" versus "less government" or "broader prosperity" versus "free markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakoff|first=George|title=Don't think of an elephant!: know your values and frame the debate: the essential guide for progressives|year=2004|publisher=Chelsea Green |location=White River Junction VT|isbn=1931498717|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Hypocognition has been blamed for preventing the practical application of [[evidence-based medicine]] in areas where [[Framing (social sciences)|frames]] (contextual and presentational influences on perceptions of reality) obscure facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Illyrian''' {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|l|ɪ|r|i|ə|n}} languages are a group of [[Indo-European languages]] that were spoken in the western part of the [[Balkans]]&lt;ref&gt;If the [[Messapian language]] was close enough to the Illyrian languages to be considered an Illyrian language, then Illyrian would also have been spoken in southern [[Italy]].&lt;/ref&gt; in former times by groups identified as [[Illyrians]]: [[Ardiaei]], [[Delmatae]], [[Pannonii]], [[Autariates]], [[Taulantii]] (see [[list of ancient tribes in Illyria]]). Some [[Indo-European sound changes|sound changes]] from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] to Illyrian and other language features are deduced from what remains of the Illyrian languages, but because there are no examples of ancient Illyrian [[literature]] surviving&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodard|2008|p=6}}: "While the Illyrians are a well-documented people of antiquity, not a single verifiable inscription has survived written in the Illyrian language."&lt;/ref&gt; (aside from the [[Messapian language|Messapian]] writings if they can be considered Illyrian), it is difficult to clarify its place within the [[Indo-European language family]]. Because of the uncertainty,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=67}}: "Though almost nothing of it survives, except for names, the Illyrian language has figured prominently in several theories regarding the spread of Indo-European languages into Europe."&lt;/ref&gt; most sources provisionally place the Illyrian language family on its own branch of Indo-European, though its relation to other languages, ancient and modern, continues to be studied.

==Classification==
The Illyrian languages are part of the Indo-European language family. The relation of the Illyrian languages to other Indo-European languages—ancient and modern—is poorly understood due to the paucity of data and is still being examined. Today, the main source of authoritative information about the Illyrian language consists of a handful of Illyrian words cited in classical sources, and numerous examples of Illyrian [[anthroponym]]s, [[ethnonym]]s, [[toponym]]s and [[hydronym]]s.

Given the scarcity of the data it is difficult to identify the sound changes that have taken place in the Illyrian languages; the most widely accepted one is that the Indo-European voiced aspirates {{IPA|/bʰ/}}, {{IPA|/dʰ/}}, {{IPA|/ɡʰ/}} became voiced consonants {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}}.&lt;ref name="Mallory and Adams 1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Mallory|Adams|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christidis et al. 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Christidis|Arapopoulou|Chritē|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grouping of Illyrian with the [[Messapian language]] has been proposed for about a century, but remains an unproven hypothesis. The theory is based on classical sources, [[archaeology]] and [[onomastics]]. Messapian material culture bears a number of similarities to Illyrian material culture. Some Messapian anthroponyms have close Illyrian equivalents.

A grouping of Illyrian with the [[Venetic language]] and [[Liburnian language]], once spoken in northeastern [[Italy]] and [[Liburnia]] respectively, has also been proposed. The consensus now is that Illyrian was quite distinct from Venetic and Liburnian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=183}}: "We may begin with the Venetic peoples, Veneti, Carni, Histri and Liburni, whose language set them apart from the rest of the Illyrians."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=81}}: "In Roman Pannonia the Latobici and [[Varciani]] who dwelt east of the Venetic Catari in the upper Sava valley were Celtic but the Colapiani of the Colapis (Kulpa) valley were Illyrians (north Pannonian), exhibiting names such as Liccaius, Bato, Cralus, Lirus and Plassarus."&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Centum vs. Satem===
In the absence of sufficient lexical data and texts written in the Illyrian languages, the theories supporting the [[Centum]] character of the Illyrian language have been based mainly on the Centum character of the [[Venetic]] language, which was thought to be related to Illyrian, in particular regarding Illyrian toponyms and names such as ''Vescleves'', ''Acrabanus'', ''Gentius'', ''Clausal'' etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|loc=Polomé, Edgar C. "Balkan Languages (Illyrian, Thracian and Daco-Moesian), pp. 866-888}}; {{harvnb|Birnbaum|Puhvel|1966|loc=Hamp, Eric P. "The Position of Albanian", pp. 97-121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between Venetic and Illyrian was later discredited and they are no longer considered closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersen|2003|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars supporting the [[Satem]] character of the Illyrian languages highlight particular toponyms and personal names such as ''Asamum'', ''Birzinimum'' ''Zanatis'' etc. in which these scholars claim that there is clear evidence of the Satem character of the Illyrian language. They also point to other toponyms including ''Osseriates'' derived from ''/*eghero/'' (lake)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christidis|Arapopoulou|Chritē|2007|p=746}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Birziminium'' from PIE ''/*bherǵh/''&lt;ref name="Woodard 2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Woodard|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Asamum'' from PIE ''/*aḱ-mo/'' (sharp).&lt;ref name="Mallory and Adams 1997, p. 288"&gt;{{harvnb|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christidis|Arapopoulou|Chritē|2007|p=748}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the above-mentioned Venetic toponyms and personal names are accepted as Illyrian in origin, it is not clear that they originated in a Centum language. ''Vescleves'', ''Acrabanus'', ''Gentius'' and ''Clausal'' are explained by proponents of the hypothesis that the Illyrian languages had a Centum character, through comparison with IE languages such as Sanskrit or Ancient Greek, or reconstructed PIE. For example, ''Vescleves'' has been explained as PIE ''*wesu-ḱlewes'' (of good fame).&lt;ref name="Christidis et al. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blench|1999|p=250}}; {{harvnb|Woodard|2008|p=259}}; {{harvnb|Fortson|2004|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the name ''Acrabanus'' as a compound name has been compared with Ancient Greek ''/akros/'' with no signs of [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]],&lt;ref name="Mallory and Adams 1997"/&gt; or ''Clausal'' has been related to /*''klew''/ (wash, rinse).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|p=874}}: "''Clausal'', river near Scodra, may be derived from an IE theme *''klew''- 'wash, rinse (: Gk. ''κλύζω'', Lat. ''cluō'', 'purge')."&lt;/ref&gt; In all these cases the supporters of the Centum character of the Illyrian language consider PIE ''*ḱ &gt; /*k/'' or PIE ''*ǵ &gt; /*g/'' followed by an ''/l/'' or ''/r/'' to be evidence of a Centum character of the Illyrian language. However, it has been shown that even in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], which are [[Satem]] languages, in this phonetical position the palatovelars have been generally depalatized (the depalatization of PIE ''*ḱ &gt; *k'' and ''*ǵ &gt; *g'' before ''/r/'' and ''/l/'' regularly in Albanian).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kortlandt|2008}}; {{harvnb|Hamp|1960|pp=275–280}}; {{harvnb|Demiraj|1988|p=44}}; {{harvnb|Demiraj|1996|p=190}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the name ''Gentius'' or ''Genthius'' does not help to solve the problem since we have two Illyrian forms ''Genthius'' and ''Zanatis''. If ''Gentius'' or ''Genthius'' derives from ''*ǵen-'' (be born) this is proof of a Centum language, but if the name ''Zanatis'' is similarly generated (or from ''*ǵen-'' know) than we have a Satem language.&lt;ref name="Mallory and Adams 1997, p. 288"/&gt; Another problem related to the name ''Gentius'' is that nowadays it cannot be stated surely if the initial ''/g/'' of the sources was a ''palatovelar''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krahe|1955|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a ''labiovelar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayer|1957|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking into account the absence of sufficient data and sometimes the dual nature of their interpretation, the Centum/Satem character of the Illyrian language is still uncertain and requires more evidence.&lt;ref name="Mallory and Adams 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christidis et al. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodard 2008"/&gt;

==Illyrian dialects==
The Greeks were the first literate people to come into frequent contact with the speakers of Illyrian languages. Their conception of "Illyrioi", however, differed from what the Romans would later call "Illyricum". The Greek term encompassed only the peoples who lived on the borders of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] and [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]]. [[Pliny the Elder]], in his work Natural History, applies a stricter usage of the term Illyrii when speaking of ''Illyrii proprie dicti'' ("Illyrians properly so-called") among the native communities in the south of Roman Dalmatia.

For a couple of centuries before and after the Roman conquest in the late 1st century BC, the concept of Illyricum expanded towards the west and north. Finally it encompassed all native peoples from the Adriatic to the Danube, inhabiting the Roman provinces of [[Dalmatia]], [[Pannonia]] and [[Moesia]], regardless of their ethnic and cultural differences.

An extensive study of Illyrian names and territory was undertaken by [[Hans Krahe]] in the first decades of the twentieth century. He and other scholars argued for a broad distribution of Illyrian peoples considerably beyond the [[Balkans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krahe|1925}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though in his later work, Krahe curbed his view of the extent of Illyrian settlement.&lt;ref name="Krahe 1955"&gt;{{harvnb|Krahe|1955}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The further refinements of Illyrian onomastic provinces for that Illyrian area included in the later Roman province were proposed by [[Géza Alföldy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alföldy|1964|pp=55–104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified five principal groups: (1) "real Illyrians" south of the river Neretva and extending south of the provincial boundary with Macedonia at the river Drin to include the Illyris of north and central Albania; (2) the ''Delmatae'' who occupied the middle Adriatic coast between the "real Illyrians" and the Liburni; (3) the ''Venetic Liburni'' of the northeast Adriatic; (4) the ''Japodes'' who dwelt north of the Delmatae and behind Liburni, where names reveal a mixture of Venetic, Celtic and Illyrian; and (5) the ''Pannonian'' people north in Bosnia, Northern Montenegro, and western Serbia.

These identifications were later challenged by [[Radoslav Katičić]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benać|1964|loc=Katičić, Radoslav. "Suvremena istrazivanja o jeziku starosjedilaca ilirskih provincija – Die neuesten Forschungen über die einheimische Sprachschicht in den illyrischen Provinzen", pp. 9-58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katičić|1965|pp=53–76}}; {{harvnb|Katičić|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who on the basis of personal names which occur commonly in Illyricum distinguished three dialect areas: (1) ''South-Eastern Illyrian'', extending southwards from the southern part of Montenegro and including most of Albania west of the river Drin, though its demarcation to the south remains uncertain; (2) ''Central Illyrian'' consisting of most of ex-Yugoslavia, north of southern Montenegro to the west of Morava, excepting ancient Liburnia in the northwest, but perhaps extending into Pannonia in the north; (3) ''Liburnian'', whose names resemble those of the Venetic territory to the northeast.

The onomastic differences between the ''South-Eastern'' and ''Central'' areas are not sufficient to show that two clearly differentiated dialects of Illyrian were in use in these areas.&lt;ref name="Woodard 2008"/&gt; However, as Katičić has argued, the core onomastic area of Illyrian proper is to be located in the southeast of that Balkan region, traditionally associated with the Illyrians (centered in modern Albania).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katičić|1976|pp=179–180}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suić and Katičić question the existence of a separate people of Illyrii. For them, Illyrii proprie dicti are peoples inhabiting the heartland of the Illyrian kingdom; Suić, M. (1976) "Illyrii proprie dicti" ANUBiH 11 gcbi 11, 179-197. Katičić, R. (1964) "Illyrii proprie dicti" ZAnt 13-14, 87-97 Katičić, R. (1965) "Nochmals Illyrii proprie dicti" ZAnt 16, 241-244. This view is also supported in Papazoglu, F. (1989) "L'organisation politique de l'Illyrie meridionale (A propos du livre de P. Cabanes sur "Les Illyriens de Bardylis a Genthios")" ZAnt. 39, 31-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally Illyrian has referred to any non-Celtic language in the northwestern Balkans. Recent scholarship from the 1960s tends to agree that the region inhabited by Illyrian tribes can be divided into three distinct linguistic and cultural areas, of which only one can be properly termed "Illyrian".&lt;ref name=Fortson/&gt; No written texts regarding self-identification exist from the Illyrians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roisman |first1=Joseph |last2=Worthington |first2=Ian |title=A Companion to Ancient Macedonia |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444351637 |page=279 |url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=QsJ183uUDkMC&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq= |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and no inscriptions in Illyrian exist, with the only   linguistic remains being place names (toponyms) and some glosses.&lt;ref name=Fortson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fortson |first1=Benjamin W. |title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444359688 |page=465 |url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=bSxHgej4tKMC&amp;pg=PA465&amp;dq= |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Illyrian vocabulary==
Since there are no Illyrian texts, sources for identifying Illyrian words have been identified by Hans Krahe&lt;ref name="Krahe 1955"/&gt; as being of four kinds: inscriptions, glosses of Illyrian words in classical texts, names—including proper names (mostly inscribed on tombstones), toponyms and river names—and Illyrian loanwords in other languages. The last category has proven particularly contentious. The names occur in sources that range over more than a millennium, including [[numismatic]] evidence, as well as posited original forms of placenames.&lt;ref name="Krahe 1955"/&gt; There are no Illyrian inscriptions (Messapian inscriptions are treated separately, and there is no consensus that they are to be reckoned as Illyrian). The spearhead found at [[Kovel]] and thought by some to be Illyrian&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Must, reviewing Krahe 1955 in ''Language'' '''32'''.4 (October 1956), p. 721.&lt;/ref&gt; is considered by the majority of runologists to be Eastern Germanic, and most likely Gothic, while a votive inscription on a ring found near [[Shkodër]] which was initially interpreted as Illyrian was shown to actually be [[Byzantine Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ognenova|1959|pp=794–799}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alföldy identified five principal onomastic provinces within the Illyrian area:{{dubious|Why a 1960 theory of Afoldy is reprentative contrary to more rencet scholars, i.e. Wilkes etc|date=May 2016}} 1) the "real" Illyrians south of the river [[Neretva]] in [[Dalmatia]] and extending south to [[Epirus]]; 2) the [[Delmatae]], who occupied the middle Adriatic coast between the "real Illyrians" to the south and the [[Liburni]] to the north; 3) the [[Liburni]], a branch of [[Venetic language|Venetic]] in the northeast Adriatic; 4) the [[Iapodes]], who dwelt north of the Delmatae and behind (inland from) the coastal Liburnians; 5) the [[Pannoni]]ans in the northern lands, and in Bosnia, northern Montenegro and Western Serbia.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} [[Radoslav Katičić|Katičić]] does not recognize a separate Pannonian onomastic area, and includes the Pannoni with the Delmatae.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katičić|1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Below, names from four of Alföldy's five onomastic areas are listed, [[Liburnian language|Liburnian]] excluded, having been identified as being akin to [[Venetic language|Venetic]].

The meaning of these plausible correspondences is hard to determine: neither the internal links between the three principal Illyrian onomastic provinces nor those between them and other areas indicate more than that the languages spoken by peoples in the Illyrian territories were somehow related if not altogether common."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=186}}: "The fourth of the Venetic-speaking peoples around the head of the Adriatic were the Liburni, who occupied the coast and islands between Istria and the river Titus (Krka) and had been known to the Greeks since at least the eighth century BC."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delmatae===
Hundreds of Delmatae names have been recorded. Characteristic names include:

*Andena, Andes, [[Andis]], [[Andio]], Andia
*Aplis, Apludus, Aplus, Aplius
*Apurus

Delmatae names in common with the [[Pannoni]] (some also occur among the south Illyrians):

{{div col|colwidth=18em}}
*Bardurius.
*Bato
*Carius
*Dasantilla
*Dasas, Dazas
*Dasto
*Plator, Platino
*Scenobarbus, Scenobardos (?)
*Verzo
*Verzulus
{{div col end}}

Some Delmatae names probably originate from the [[Liburnian language|Liburnians]]. This conclusion is based on the Liburnian [[suffixes]]: -icus, -ica, -ocus, -ico; and from the distribution of the names among the Liburni/Veneti, and from their absence or scarcity in other onomastic areas:

{{div col|colwidth=18em}}
*Acenica
*Clevata
*Darmocus
*Germanicus (the native Delmatae stem Germanus, Germus, with the Venetic/Liburnian ''-icus'' suffix)
*Labrico
*Lunnicus
*Melandrica
*Turus
{{div col end}}

From the southern Illyrians, the names Boria, Epicadus, Laedicalius, Loiscus, Pinnes and Tato and some others are present. From the Iapodes, Diteio and Ve(n)do, and a few names of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin (not shown here).

===Messapic===
*Dasius, Latin form of a [[Messapian language|Messapic]] name from southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2004|p=182}}: "1 Dasius: The Latin form of a Messapic name from southern Italy..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illyrian theonyms===
{{main|Paleo-Balkanic mythology}}

The following names of gods ([[theonym]]s) derive from possibly several languages ([[Liburnian]], Illyrian, etc.) and are names of gods worshipped by the [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Illyrians]]. However, they are known through [[Interpretatio romana]] and their names may have been corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=245}}: "Illyrian deities are named on monuments of the Roman era, some in equation with gods of the classical pantheon. ... Thus several deities occur only in Istria, including Eia, Malesocus, Boria and Iria. Anzotica was the Liburnian Venus and appears in the traditional image of the classical goddess. Other local deities were Latra, Sentona and the nymph Ica, worshipped in eastern Istria at a spring still known by praying in relief sculpture, Knez 1974 (ritual vessel), Baçe 1984 (temple architecture in Illyrian Albania)."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{div col|colwidth=18em}}
*Anzotica
*Armatus&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=247}}: "Sometimes the name of a local deity is recorded only in the Latin form, for example, Armatus at Delminium (Duvno) who was evidently a war god of the Delmatae, and the Latin Liber who appears with the attributes of Silvanus and Terminus..."&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bindus&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=200}}: "Continuity in a local tradition of engraved ornament is to be seen on other monuments of the Roman period, including altars dedicated by chiefs of the Japodes at the shrine of Bindus Neptunus at a spring near Bihac  (see figure 30)."&lt;/ref&gt;
*Boria
*Eia
*Ica
*Iria
*Latra
*Malesocus
*Medaurus&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=247}}: "The Illyrian town Rhizon (Risinium) on the Gulf of Kotor had its protective deity Medaurus..."&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sentona
*Thana&lt;ref name="Wilkes-Vidasus-Thana"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|pp=246–247}}: "North of the Japodes, the altars to Vidasus and Thana dedicated at the hot springs of Topuško..."&lt;/ref&gt;
*Vidasus&lt;ref name="Wilkes-Vidasus-Thana"/&gt;
{{div col end}}

==External influences==
{{See also|Jireček Line}}
The [[Ancient Greek]] language would have become an important external influence on Illyrian-speakers who occupied lands adjacent to ancient [[List of ancient cities in Illyria#Greek|Greek colonies]], mainly on the Adriatic coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davison|Gaffney|Wilkes|Marin|2006|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Pomeroy|Burstein|Donlan|Roberts|2008|p=255}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taulantii]] and the [[Bylliones]] had, according to [[Strabo]], become bilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Boardman|1994|loc="The Illyrians c. 540-360 B.C.", p. 423: "Through contact with their Greek neighbors some Illyrian tribe became bilingual (Strabo VII.7.8 ''diglottoi''): in particular the Bylliones and the Taulantian tribes close to Epidamnus."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invading [[Celts]] who settled on lands occupied by Illyrians brought the Illyrians into contact with the [[Celtic languages]] and some tribes were [[Celticization|Celticized]] especially those in [[Dalmatia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hornblower|Spawforth|2003|p=426}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bunson|1995|loc="ILLYRICUM (Dalmatia)", p. 202}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pannoni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hornblower|Spawforth|2003|p=1106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Intensive contact may have happened in what is now [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Croatia]], and [[Serbia]]. Due to this intensive contact, and because of conflicting classical sources, it is unclear whether some ancient tribes were Illyrian or [[Celts|Celtic]] (ex: [[Scordisci]])&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ó hÓgáin|2003|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or mixed in varying degree. [[Thracians]] and [[Paeonians]] also occupied lands populated by Illyrians, bringing Illyrians into contact with the [[Thracian language]] and [[Paeonian language]]. Certainly, no serious linguistic study of Illyrian language could be made without the inclusion of Latin, in addition to ancient Greek, Thracian and Celtic languages, as the peoples that spoke those languages were recorded by both ancient and modern historians to have lived in lands inhabited by Illyrians at one period of time in history or another. Last, but certainly not least, any comprehensive study of Illyrian language  must take into account the Indo-European glossary.&lt;ref name="balkancenter.org"/&gt;

===Greek===
The following names may derive from [[Greek language|Greek]]:
{{div col|colwidth=18em}}
*[[Ardiaioi]], the ancient Greek name for [[Ardiaei]] (''ardis'', 'head of the arrow, sting').  One challenge to this theory is that the suggested root-word ''ardis'' does not necessarily form  'Ardiaioi', by the rules of Greek language.&lt;ref name="balkancenter.org"/&gt;
*[[Ceraunii]], tribal exonym, ("Κεραύνιοι, "Thunderbolt-men)"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=217}}: "Ceraunii whose name deriving from the Greek for 'thunderbolt' links them with high mountains..."&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cleitus (disambiguation)|Cleitus]], ("κλειτός", "renowned man")
*[[King Glaukias|Glaukias]], ("γλαυκός", "gleaming man")
*[[Illyrians]], gr. {{lang|el|Ἰλλυριοί}}, tribal exonym
*Mellito, Greek and Celtic element,{{sfn|Wilkes|1995|p=79}} gr. {{lang|el|μελλιτόεις}}, "like honey"
*[[Plator]], gr. {{lang|el|Πλάτων}}, "wide man"
*[[Pleuratus]], gr. {{lang|el|πλευρά}}, "side'"
{{div col end}}

===Latin===
The following names may derive from [[Latin language|Latin]]:
*[[Ardiaei]], (''ardea'', 'heron'). However, the problem with the theory supporting the Latin etymology for the Ardiaei is that Ardiaioi, a Greek form of Ardiaei is found in several pre-Roman sources, and it turns that it precedes the Roman/Latin Influence, as it precedes  the Vardaei, another form of this name. Greek historian Strabo says in paragraph 6 (Book 7, chapter 5) of his Geographica: “The Ardiaei were called by the men of later times "Vardiaei".&lt;ref name="balkancenter.org"/&gt;

==Extinction==
The Illyrian languages were likely extinct between the 2nd and 6th centuries AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fol|2002|p=225}}: "Romanisation was total and complete by the end of the 4th century A.D. In the case of the Illyrian elements a Romance intermediary is inevitable as long as Illyrian was probably extinct in the 2nd century A.D."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="linguistlist.org"&gt;[http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=xil Eastern Michigan University Linguist List: The Illyrian Language].&lt;/ref&gt; with the possible exception of the language that developed into Albanian according to the theory of Albanian descent from Illyrian. It has also been posited that Illyrian was preserved and spoken in the countryside, as attested in the 4th-5th century testimonies of [[St. Jerome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fortson|2004|p=405}}: "Although they were to play an important role in the Roman army and even furnished later Rome with several famous emperors (including Diocletian, Constantine the Great and Justinian I), the Illyrians never became fully assimilated Romans and kept their language."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=266}}: "Alongside Latin the native Illyrian survived in the country areas, and St Jerome claimed to speak his 'sermo gentilis' (Commentary on Isaiah 7.19)."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24803">In [[computational learning theory]], '''induction of regular languages''' refers to the task of learning a [[formal grammar|formal description]] (e.g. grammar) of a [[regular language]] from a given set of example strings. Although Mark E. Gold has shown that not every regular language can be learned this way (see [[language identification in the limit]]), approaches have been investigated for a variety of subclasses. They are sketched in this article. For learning of more general grammars, see [[Grammar induction]].

==Example==

A '''[[regular language]]''' is defined as a (finite or infinite) set of '''[[string (computer science)|strings]]''' that can be described by one of the mathematical formalisms called "[[finite automaton]]", "[[regular grammar]]", or "[[regular expression]]", all of which have the same expressive power. Since the latter formalism leads to shortest notations, it shall be introduced and used here. Given a set Σ of symbols (a.k.a. alphabet), a '''[[regular expression]]''' can be any of
* ∅ (denoting the empty set of strings),
* ε (denoting the singleton set containing just the empty string),
* ''a'' (where ''a'' is any character in Σ; denoting the singleton set just containing the single-character string ''a''),
* ''r''+''s'' (where ''r'' and ''s'' are, in turn, simpler regular expressions; denoting their set's union)
* ''r''⋅''s'' (denoting the set of all possible concatenations of strings from ''r'' 's and ''s'' 's set),
* ''r''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (denoting the set of ''n''-fold repetitions of strings from ''r'' 's set, for any ''n''≥1), or 
* ''r''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (similarly denoting the set of ''n''-fold repetitions, but also including the empty string, seen as 0-fold repetition).
For example, using Σ = { 0,1 }, the regular expression (0+1+ε)⋅(0+1) denotes the set of all binary numbers with one or two digits (leading zero allowed), while 1⋅(0+1)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;⋅0 denotes the (infinite) set of all even binary numbers (no leading zeroes).

Given a set of strings (also called "positive examples"), the '''task of regular language induction''' is to come up with a regular expression that denotes a set containing all of them.
As an example, given { 1, 10, 100 }, a "natural" description could be the regular expression 1⋅0&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to the informal characterization "''a 1 followed by arbitrarily many (maybe even none) 0es''".
However, (0+1)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and 1+(1⋅0)+(1⋅0⋅0) is another regular expression, denoting the largest (assuming Σ={0,1}) and the smallest set containing the given strings, and called the trivial '''overgeneralization''' and '''undergeneralization''', respectively.
Some approaches work in an extended setting where also a set of "negative example" strings is given; then, a regular expression is to be found that generates all of the positive, but none of the negative examples.

For each of the negative example strings 11, 1001, 101, and 0, the [[upper set]] of automata generating it is shown. The only automata that generate all of { 1, 10, 100 }, but none of { 11, 1001, 101, 0 } are the trivial bottom automaton and the one corresponding to the regular expression 1⋅0&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
|}

==Lattice of automata==

Dupont et al. have shown that the set of all structurally complete finite automata&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. finite automata without unnecessary states and transitions, with respect to the given input set of strings&lt;/ref&gt;
generating a given input set of example strings forms a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], with the trivial undergeneralized and the trivial overgeneralized automaton as bottom and top element, respectively.
Each member of this lattice can be obtained by [[quotient automaton|factoring]] the undergeneralized automaton by an appropriate [[congruence relation]].
The image shows an example for the above input string set { 1, 10, 100 }.
Each automaton is denoted by an equivalent regular expression. For the trivial undergeneralization at the bottom node, also the automaton form is sketched in {{color|#808080|grey}}, consisting of states {{color|#808080|a}}, {{color|#808080|b}}, {{color|#808080|c}}, and {{color|#808080|d}}. Each node's automaton is the result of factoring the bottom automaton by the congruence relation shown in {{color|#808080|grey}} below the node.

If both positive and negative example strings are given, Dupont et al. build the lattice from the positive examples, and then investigate the separation border between automata that generate some negative example and such that do not.
Most interesting are those automata immediately below the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=P. Dupont |author2=L. Miclet |author3=E.

C. Carrasco |editor2=J. Oncina | series=LNCS| contribution-url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.54.5734}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the image, separation borders are shown for the negative example strings 11, 1001, 101, 0.

Coste and Nicolas present an own search method within this lattice, which they relate to Mitchell's [[version space]] paradigm.
To find the separation border, they use a graph coloring algorithm on the state inequality relation induced by the negative examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. Coste |author2=J.

Later, they investigate several ordering relations on the set of all possible state fusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. Coste |author2=J.

Kudo and Shimbo use the representation by automaton factorizations to give a unique framework for the following approaches (sketched [[#Approaches|below]]):
* [[#k-reversible languages|k-reversible languages]] and the "tail clustering" follow-up approach,
* [[#Successor automata|Successor automata]] and the predecessor-successor method, and
* [[#Early approaches|pumping-based approaches]] (framework-integration challenged by Luzeaux,&lt;ref name="Luzeaux.1994"&gt;{{cite book| author=Dominique Luzeaux| chapter=A Universal Approach to Positive Regular Grammar Inference| title=Proc. 15th World IMACS Congress on Scientific Computation, Modelling and Applied Mathematics|date=Aug 1997| url=http://www.etca.fr/CTA/gip/Publis/Luzeaux/Index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; however).
Each of these approaches is shown to correspond to a particular kind of congruence relations used for factorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. Kudo |author2=M.

==Approaches==

===''k''-reversible languages===

Angluin considers so-called "''k''-reversible" regular automata, that is, deterministic automata in which each state can be reached from at most one state by following a transition chain of length ''k''.
Formally, if Σ, ''Q'', and δ denote the input alphabet, the state set, and the transition function of an automaton ''A'', respectively, then ''A'' is called ''k''-reversible if : ∀''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ Σ ∀''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''Q'': δ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;...''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) = δ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;...''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) ⇒ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where δ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; means the homomorphic extension of δ to arbitrary words.
Angluin gives a cubic algorithm for learning of the smallest ''k''-reversible language from a given set of input words; for ''k''=0, the algorithm has even almost linear complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=D. Angluin| title=A Note on the Number of Queries Needed to Identify Regular Languages| journal=Information and Control| year=1981| volume=51| pages=76–87| doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(81)90090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=D. Angluin| title=Inference of Reversible Languages| journal=J. ACM| year=1982| volume=293| pages=741–765| doi=10.1145/322326.322334}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The required state uniqueness after ''k''+1 given symbols forces unifying automaton states, thus leading to a proper generalization different from the trivial undergeneralized automaton. 
This algorithm has been used to learn simple parts of English syntax;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Robert C. Berwick |author2=Samuel F. Pilato | title=Learning Syntax by Automata Induction| journal=Machine Learning| year=1987| volume=2| number=1| pages=9–38| doi=10.1007/bf00058753}}&lt;/ref&gt;
later, an incremental version has been provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|author1=Rajesh Parekh |author2=Codrin Nichitiu |author3=Vasant Honavar | title=A Polynomial Time Incremental Algorithm for Regular Grammar Inference|date=Jan 1997| number=TR 97-03| pages=14| institution=AI Research Group, Iowa State Univ.|url=http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1152&amp;context=cs_techreports}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another approach based on ''k''-reversible automata is the ''tail clustering method''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|author1=L. Miclet |author2=C. Faure | title=Reconnaissance des Formes Structurelle: Développement et Tendances| year=1985| institution=INRIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successor automata===

From a given set of input strings, Vernadat and Richetin build a so-called '''successor automaton''', consisting of one state for each distinct character and a transition between each two adjacent characters' states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. Vernadat |author2=M. Richetin | chapter=Regular Inference for Syntactic Pattern Recognition: A Case Study| title=Proc. 7th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)| year=1984| pages=1370–1372}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the singleton input set { ''{{not a typo|aabbaabb}}'' } leads to an automaton corresponding to the [[regular expression]] (''a''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''b''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.

An extension of this approach is the '''predecessor-successor method''' which generalizes each character repetition immediately to a [[Kleene plus|Kleene &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and then includes for each character the set of its possible predecessors in its state.
Successor automata can learn exactly the class of '''[[Local language (formal language)|local languages]]'''.
Since each [[regular language]] is the homomorphic image of a local language, grammars from the former class can be learned by ''lifting'', if an appropriate (depending on the intended application) [[string homomorphism|homomorphism]] is provided.
In particular, there is such a homomorphism for the class of languages learnable by the predecessor-successor method.&lt;ref name="Casacuberta.Garcia.Vidal.1987"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=P. Garcia |author2=E. Vidal |author3=F. Casacuberta | title=Local Languages, The Successor Method, and a Step Towards a General Methodology for the Inference of Regular Grammars| journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence| year=1987| volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The learnability of local languages can be reduced to that of ''k''-reversible languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Takashi Yokomori| chapter=Learning Context-Free Languages Efficiently| title=Proc.

===Early approaches===

Chomsky and Miller (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|author1=N. Chomsky |author2=G.A. Miller | title=Pattern Conception| year=1957| number=Document AD110076| institution=ASTIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
used the [[Pumping lemma for regular languages|pumping lemma]]: they guess a part ''v'' of an input string ''uvw'' and try to build a corresponding cycle into the automaton to be learned; using '''membership queries''' they ask, for appropriate ''k'', which of the strings ''uw'', ''uvvw'', ''uvvvw'', ..., ''uv&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;w'' also belongs to the language to be learned, thereby refining the structure of their automaton. In 1959, Solomonoff generalized this approach to [[context-free languages]], which also obey a [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages|pumping lemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=R. Solomonoff| chapter=A New Method for Discovering the Grammars of Phrase Structure Languages| title=Proc. Int. Conf. on Information Processing|date=Jun 1959| pages=285–290| publisher=R.Oldenbourg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cover automata===

Câmpeanu et al. learn a finite automaton as a compact representation of a large finite language.
Given such a language ''F'', they search a so-called ''cover automaton'' ''A'' such that its language ''L''(''A'') covers ''F'' in the following sense: ''L''(''A'') ∩ Σ&lt;sup&gt;≤''l''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''F'', where ''l'' is the length of the longest string in ''F'', and Σ&lt;sup&gt;≤''l''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the set of all strings not longer than ''l''. 
If such a cover automaton exists, ''F'' is uniquely determined by ''A'' and ''l''.
For example, ''F'' = { ''ad'', ''read'', ''reread'' } has ''l''=6 and a cover automaton corresponding to the regular expression (''r''⋅''e'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''a''⋅''d''.

For two strings ''x'' and ''y'', Câmpeanu et al. define ''x'' ~ ''y'' if ''xz''∈''F'' ⇔ ''yz''∈''F'' for all strings ''z'' of a length such that both ''xz'' and ''yz'' are not longer than ''l''.&lt;ref&gt;This relation generalizes the relation ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; from the [[Myhill-Nerode theorem#Statement of the theorem|Myhill-Nerode theorem]]. It has been investigated in more detail in sect.3 of: {{cite journal |author1=Cynthia Dwork |author2=Larry Stockmeyer | title=A Time Complexity Gap for Two-Way Probabilistic Finite-State Automata | journal=SIAM Journal on Computing | volume=19 | number=6 | pages=1011–1023 | url=http://cstheory.com/stockmeyer@sbcglobal.net/pfa_gap.ps | year=1990 | doi=10.1137/0219069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this relation, whose lack of [[transitive relation|transitivity]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, ''F'' = { ''aab'', ''baa'', ''aabb'' } leads to ''aab'' ~ ''aabb'' (only ''z''=ε needs to be considered to check this) and ''aabb'' ~ ''baa'' (similarly), but not ''aab'' ~ ''baa'' (due to the case ''z''=''b''). According to Câmpeanu et al. (2001, Lemma 1, p.5), however ''x'' ~ ''y'' ∧ ''y'' ~ ''z'' → ''x'' ~ ''z'' holds for strings ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' with |''x''| ≤ |''y''| ≤ |''z''|.&lt;/ref&gt; causes considerable technical problems, they give an [[big o notation|''O'']](''n''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref group=note&gt;where ''n'' is the number of states of a DFA ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''L''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''F''&lt;/ref&gt; algorithm to construct from ''F'' a cover automaton ''A'' of minimal state count.

===Residual automata===

For a set ''S'' of strings and a string ''u'', the '''[[Brzozowski derivative]]''' ''u''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''S'' is defined as the set of all rest-strings obtainable from a string in ''S'' by cutting off its prefix ''u'' (if possible), formally: ''u''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''S'' = { ''v'' ∈ Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: ''uv'' ∈ ''S'' }, cf. picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Janusz A. Brzozowski| title=Derivatives of Regular Expressions| journal=J ACM| year=1964| volume=11| pages=481–494| doi=10.1145/321239.321249}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Denis et al. define a '''residual automaton''' to be a nondeterministic finite automaton ''A'' where each state ''q'' corresponds to a Brzozowski derivative of its accepted language ''L''(''A''), formally: ∀''q''∈''Q'' ∃''u''∈Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: ''L''(''A'',''q'') = ''u''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''L''(''A''), where ''L''(''A'',''q'') denotes the language accepted from ''q'' as start state.

They show that each regular language is generated by a uniquely determined minimal residual automaton. Its states are ∪-indecomposable Brzozowski derivatives, and it may be exponentially smaller than the minimal deterministic automaton.
Moreover, they show that residual automata for regular languages cannot be learned in polynomial time, even assuming optimal sample inputs.
They give a learning algorithm for residual automata and prove that it learns the automaton from its ''characteristic sample'' of positive and negative input strings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=François Denis |author2=Aurélien Lemay |author3=Alain Terlutte | chapter=Learning Regular Languages Using Non Deterministic Finite Automata| title=Grammatical Inference: Algorithms and Applications, 5th International Colloquium, ICGI| year=2000| volume=1891| pages=39–50| publisher=Springer| editor=Arlindo L.

ALT '01| year=2001 |url=http://www.dsic.upv.es/asignaturas/facultad/apr/rfsa.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reduced regular expressions===

Brill defines a '''reduced regular expression''' to be any of 
* ''a'' (where a is any character in Σ; denoting the singleton set just containing the single-character string a),
* ¬''a'' (denoting any other single character in Σ except ''a''),
* • (denoting any single character in Σ)
* ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, (¬''a'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, or •&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (denoting arbitrarily many, possibly zero, repetitions of characters from the set of ''a'', ¬''a'', or •, respectively), or
* ''r''⋅''s'' (where r and s are, in turn, simpler reduced regular expressions; denoting the set of all possible concatenations of strings from ''r'' 's and ''s'' 's set).
Given an input set of strings, he builds step by step a [[tree (data structure)|tree]] with each branch labelled by a reduced regular expression accepting a prefix of some input strings, and each node labelled with the set of lengths of accepted prefixes.
He aims at learning correction rules for English spelling errors,&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example: Replace "''past''" by "''passed''" in the context "(¬''t''⋅''o'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''SINGULAR_NOUN''⋅''past''"&lt;/ref&gt;
rather than at theoretical considerations about learnability of language classes.
Consequently, he uses [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] to prune the tree-buildup, leading to a considerable improvement in run time.&lt;ref name="Brill.2000"&gt;{{cite book| author=Eric Brill| chapter=Pattern–Based Disambiguation for Natural Language Processing| title=Proc.

He holds an MA from [[Oxford University]] and an MSc from [[Sussex University]] in the UK, and was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in London in 1990. He is a life member of [[Humanists UK]].

He has travelled extensively in Central Asia and Southern Asia, researching [[Zoroastrianism]] and other religions. According to his publishers his book ''Beyond Belief'' took over 20 years of research, including an overland expedition from Europe to South and Central Asia, retracing journeys of [[Alexander the Great]], [[Robert Byron]] and [[Eric Newby]]. This research took him to sites including [[Medjugorje]] in [[Herzegovina]]; traditional [[Bogomil]] sites in the Balkans, early Christian sites across Turkey, the [[Mountains of Ararat]] near the border with Iran, Zoroastrian [[Towers of Silence]], [[Chak Chak, Iran|Chak Chak]] and other [[Zoroastrian]] centres in Iran, Christian churches in Pakistan, [[Parsees|Parsee]] temples in Mumbi, the [[Syrian Churches of Kerala]], the [[Roza Bal]] shrine at Srinagar in Kashmir; [[Lumbini]] in the Rupandehi district of Nepal; early Buddhist sites along the [[Karakorum Highway]], and historic religious sites of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].

He writes extensively on a range of topics including [[Gnostics|Gnostic Dualism]], the [[Cathars]] of the [[Languedoc]], the [[Counts of Toulouse]], [[Occitania]], [[Medieval warfare]] and the [[Medieval Inquisition]]. His work is characterised by combining serious scholarship with an entertaining style.&lt;ref&gt;"combines scholarship with entertaining writing", von Schon, Catherine V.; Fletcher, Janet; Fialkoff, Francine; Schwarzer, Anneliese; Sutton, Judith; Cameron, Janet // Library Journal; 4 January 1985, Vol. 110 Issue 6, p142 [http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/7568392/wordly-wise-oxter-english-dictionary-book]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"lively and readable" Kingsley Amis, Literary Review, January 1985&lt;/ref&gt; For several years he wrote a weekly column on English word origins for the [[Sunday Express]], a national newspaper in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Express'', passim 1984, 1985, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the [[châtelain]] of a late Medieval castle in the South of France, listed as a [[Monument Historique]] by the French Government.

The Chaldee language, also known as Babylonian Aramaic, was the form of [[Aramaic language#Middle Aramaic|Middle Aramaic]] employed by writers in [[Lower Mesopotamia]] between the fourth and eleventh centuries. It is most commonly identified with the language of the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (which was completed in the seventh century) and of post-Talmudic ([[Geonim|Geonic]]) literature, which are the most important cultural products of [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Babylonian Jews]]. The most important [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] sources for the dialect are the hundreds of inscriptions on [[incantation bowl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sokoloff|Sokoloff 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification and type==
The language was closely related to other Eastern Aramaic dialects such as [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]]. Its original pronunciation is uncertain, and has to be reconstructed with the help of these kindred dialects and of the reading tradition of the [[Yemenite Jews]],&lt;ref&gt;Morag 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and where available those of the [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraqi]], [[Syrian Jews|Syrian]] and [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Egyptian Jews]]. The value of the [[Yemenite Hebrew|Yemenite reading tradition]] has been challenged by some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern 2011&lt;/ref&gt; (The vocalized Aramaic texts with which Jews are familiar, from the [[Tanakh|Bible]] and the [[Siddur|prayer book]], are of limited usefulness for this purpose, as they are in a different dialect.)&lt;ref&gt;Elitzur Bar-Asher Siegal, Introduction to the Grammar of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Talmudic Aramaic bears all the marks of being a specialist language of study and legal argumentation, like [[Law French]], rather than a vernacular mother tongue, and continued in use for these purposes long after [[Arabic language|Arabic]] had become the language of daily life. It has developed a battery of technical logical terms, such as ''tiyuvta'' (conclusive refutation) and ''tiqu'' (undecidable moot point), which are still used in Jewish legal writings, including those in other languages, and have influenced [[modern Hebrew]].

Like the Judean ([[Galilean dialect|Galilean Aramaic]]) and Jewish dialects it was written with Hebrew alphabet.

===  Six major verbal patterns ===
There are six major verb stems or verbal patterns (binyanim) in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic.  The form ''pe‘al'' (פְּעַל) “to do”, the form ''Aph'el'' (אַפְעֵל) “let do”, and the form ''Pa'el'' (פַּעֵל) “like to do”,  are all in the active voice. But the  form ''Itpe'el'' (אִתְפְּעֵל), the form ''Itaph'al'' (אִתַפְעַל) and the form ''Itpa'al'' (אִתְפַּעַל) are essentially reflexive and have usually  function in a passive sense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yitzhak Frank]]: ''Grammar for Gemara and targum onkelos: An Introduction to Aramaic'', Ariel Institute, Jerusalem 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-59826-466-1}}, p. 18:A survey of the aramaic binyanim.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yitzhak Frank]]:  ''Grammar for Gemara and targum onkelos: An Introduction to Aramaic'': , Ariel Institute, Jerusalem 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-59826-466-1}}, p. 23:Talmud Bavli Aramaic.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern study==
The language has received considerable scholarly attention, as shown in the Bibliography below. However, the majority of those who are familiar with it, namely [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] students of Talmud, are given no systematic instruction in the language, and are expected to "sink or swim" in the course of Talmudic studies, with the help of some informal pointers showing similarities and differences with Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2005/4/kurdisrael1.htm Jay Bushinsky, "The passion of Aramaic-Kurdish Jews brought Aramaic to Israel"]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=October 2014}}

A '''kelly drive''' refers to a type of well drilling device on an oil or gas [[drilling rig]] that employs a section of pipe with a polygonal (three-, four-, six-, or eight-sided) or [[Rotating spline|splined]] outer surface, which passes through the matching polygonal or splined kelly (mating) bushing and [[Rotary table (drilling rig)|rotary table]]. This bushing is rotated via the rotary table and thus the pipe and the attached drill string turn while the polygonal pipe is free to slide vertically in the bushing as the bit digs the well deeper. When drilling, the [[Drill bit (well)|drill bit]] is attached at the end of the [[drill string]] and thus the kelly drive provides the means to turn the bit (assuming that a downhole motor is not being used).

The '''kelly''' is the polygonal tubing and the ''kelly bushing'' is the mechanical device that turns the kelly when rotated by the [[Rotary table (drilling rig)|rotary table]]. Together they are referred to as a ''kelly drive''. The upper end of the kelly is screwed into the swivel, using a left-hand thread to preclude loosening from the right-hand torque applied below. The kelly typically is about 10&amp;nbsp;ft (3&amp;nbsp;m) longer than the drill pipe segments, thus leaving a portion of newly drilled hole open below the bit after a new length of pipe has been added ("making a connection") and the drill string has been lowered until the kelly bushing engages again in the rotary table.

The [[kelly hose]] is the flexible, high-pressure hose connected from the [[Rig standpipe|standpipe]] to a gooseneck pipe on a swivel above the kelly and allows the free vertical movement of the kelly while facilitating the flow of the [[drilling fluid]] down the [[drill string]].  It generally is of steel-reinforced rubber construction but also assemblies of Chiksan steel pipe and swivels are used.

According to the ″Dictionary of Petroleum Exploration, Drilling and Production″, ″[The] kelly was named after Michael J. (King) Kelly, a Chicago baseball player (1880-1887) who was known for his base running and long slides.″&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Petroleum Exploration, Drilling &amp; Production By Norman J. Hyne page 281&lt;/ref&gt;  As steel was not as good a quality back then as it was today, the kelly was always hanging up in the kelly bushing.  There was a popular song for the famous baseball player at that time called, ″Slide Kelly, Slide!″&lt;ref&gt;[[King Kelly]]&lt;/ref&gt;  ″Sliding″ is the act of a kelly passing through the kelly bushing as it drills.

Alternatively, some say the name kelly is derived from the machine shop in which the first kelly was made.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} It was located in a town formerly named [[Home, Pennsylvania|Kellysburg, Pennsylvania]].

'''Lashi''' (endonym ''Lacid'') is a [[Burmish languages|Burmish]] language. Although the endonym Lashi is often used by Western researchers, the people refer to themselves and their language as Lacid.&lt;ref&gt;Noftz 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It is according to Nishi (1999: 70) in the Maruic branch, which preserves the preglottalized initials of Proto-Burmish in the most phonotactic environments.

Data on Lashi is available in the followining publications (A Literature Review on Segments in Lacid (Lashi) Noftz 2017,) (Luce 1985: Charts S, T, V; Huang et al. 1992; Wannemacher 1995-7, as cited in Mann 1998, and Yabu 1988).

==Distribution==
There are conflicting reports about the size of the Lacid population. Reports range from 30,000 to 60,000. &lt;ref&gt;Noftz 2017 A Literature Review on Segments in Lacid (Lashi)&lt;/ref&gt;In China, Lashi (Leqi) speakers are distributed in [[Mangshi]] City (formerly Luxi County), [[Ruili City]], [[Longchuan County, Yunnan|Longchuan County]], and [[Yingjiang County]] of western Yunnan province (Dai 2007:5). Mangshi has the most Lashi speakers, who are distributed in the following townships.
*Manghai 芒海镇
*Zhongshan 中山乡
*Dongshan 东山乡
*Santai 三台乡 (in Gonglin 拱岭寨 and Manggang 芒岗寨 villages)

Lashi is also spoken in eastern [[Shan State]], Burma. Lashi was originally spoken in the downstream area of the Ngochang Hka river valley, a tributary of the N’Mai Hka river, while [[Achang language|Ngochang]] was originally spoken in the upstream area of the Ngochang Hka river valley.&lt;ref name="Sawada2017"&gt;Sawada, Hideo. 2017. ''Two Undescribed Dialects of Northern Burmish Sub-branch: Gyannoʔ and Thoʔlhang''. Presented at ICSTLL 50, Beijing, China.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chashan language]], which is closely related to Lashi, is spoken in nearby Pianma Township 片马镇, [[Lushui County]].

'''''Limited Inc''''' is a 1988 book by [[Jacques Derrida]], containing two essays and an interview.

The first essay, "Signature Event Context," is about [[J. L. Austin]]'s theory of the [[illocutionary act]] outlined in his ''How To Do Things With Words''.&lt;ref&gt;How to do things with Words: The William James Lectures delivered at Harvard University in 1955. Ed. J. O. Urmson. Oxford: Clarendon, 1962. {{ISBN|0-674-41152-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second essay, "Limited Inc a b c...", is Derrida's response to [[John Searle]]'s "Reply to Derrida: Reiterating the Differences," which criticizes Derrida's interpretation of Austin. The book concludes with a letter by Derrida, written in response to questions posed by Gerald Graff in 1988: "Afterword: Toward an Ethic of Discussion".
Searle's essay is not itself included: he denied [[Northwestern University]] Press permission to reprint it. A summary is included between the two Derrida essays, and Derrida quotes the essay extensively.&lt;ref name="Editor's Foreword"&gt;Derrida (1988), ''Editor's Foreword'', in ''Limited Inc.'' page VII - Editor's Foreword&lt;/ref&gt;

"Signature Event Context" was originally delivered at a Montreal conference entitled "Communication," organized by the Congrès international des Sociétés de philosophie de langue française in August 1971. It was subsequently published in the Congrès' ''Proceedings'' and then collected in Derrida's ''Marges de la philosophie'' in 1972. It first appeared in English translation in the inaugural issue of the journal ''Glyph'' in 1977 and was followed in the same issue by Searle's "Reply to Derrida: Reiterating the Differences". Derrida's reply to Searle's reply, "Limited Inc a b c...", was published in ''Glyph'''s second issue later in 1977. A French edition of ''Limited Inc'' was published by Éditions Galilée under that same title (but with a point added after ''Inc'') in 1990.

=="Signature Event Context"==

The essay has three section headings, beginning with: "Writing &amp; Telecommunication" on the third page, and then followed by "Parasites. Iter, of Writing: That It Perhaps Does Not Exist", and concluding with "Signatures".

Derrida highlights Austin's theory of illocutionary acts in the "Parasites..." section because he finds it in contradiction to the definition of communication he has formulated in "Writing &amp; Telecommunication". There he considers all communication in terms traditionally reserved for writing. Derrida lists three traits of writing. First, it subsists without the subject who inscribed it. Second, the meaning of the text is never constrained by its context. "[T]he sign", Derrida explains, "possesses the characteristic of being readable even if the moment of its production is irrevocably lost and even if I do not know what its alleged author-scriptor intended to say at the moment he wrote it".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Signature Event Context," ''Limited Inc'', trans. Samuel Weber and Jeffrey Mehlman (Evanston, Il: Northwestern University Press, 1988) p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Third, this possibility of rupture from its origin is provided by a text's elements (e.g. words) being separated by spacing. Derrida says that these traits "are valid not only for all orders of 'signs' and for languages in general but moreover, beyond semio-linguistic communication, for the entire field of what philosophy would call experience".&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Signature Event Context," p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute with John Searle — "Afterword: Toward An Ethic of Discussion"==
In 1972, Derrida wrote "Signature Event Context," an essay on [[J. L. Austin]]'s [[speech act theory]]; following a critique of this text by [[John Searle]] in his 1977 essay ''Reiterating the Differences'', Derrida wrote the same year ''Limited Inc abc ...'', a long defense of his earlier argument.

Searle exemplified his view on deconstruction in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', February 2, 1984;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis H. Mackey|Louis Mackey]] and Searle (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; for example:

{{quotation|...anyone who reads deconstructive texts with an open mind is likely to be struck by the same phenomena that initially surprised me: the low level of philosophical argumentation, the deliberate obscurantism of the prose, the wildly exaggerated claims, and the constant striving to give the appearance of profundity by making claims that seem paradoxical, but under analysis often turn out to be silly or trivial.}}

In 1983, Searle told to ''The New York Review of Books'' a remark on Derrida allegedly made by [[Michel Foucault]] in a private conversation with Searle himself; Derrida later decried Searle's gesture as [[gossip]], and also condemned as violent the use of a mass circulation magazine to fight an academic debate.&lt;ref name="Afterword88p158"&gt;Derrida (1988), ''Afterword'', in ''Limited Inc.'' page 158, footnote 12&lt;/ref&gt; According to Searle's account, Foucault called Derrida's prose style "terrorist [[obscurantism]]"; Searle's quote was:

{{quotation|Michel Foucault once characterized Derrida's prose style to me as "''obscurantisme terroriste''." The text is written so obscurely that you can't figure out exactly what the thesis is (hence "''obscurantisme''") and when one criticizes it, the author says, "''Vous m'avez mal compris; vous êtes idiot' (hence "''terroriste''")}}

In 1988, Derrida wrote "Afterword: Toward An Ethic of Discussion", to be published with the previous essays in the collection ''Limited Inc''. Commenting on criticisms of his work, he wrote:&lt;ref name="Afterword88p158"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Searle83-2000"&gt;Searle (1983) and (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation| I just want to raise the question of what precisely a philosopher is doing when, in a newspaper with a large circulation, he finds himself compelled to cite private and unverifiable insults of another philosopher in order to authorize himself to insult in turn and to practice what in French is called a ''jugement d'autorite'', that is, the method and preferred practice of all dogmatism. I do not know whether the fact of citing in French suffices to guarantee the authenticity of a citation when it concerns a private opinion. I do not exclude the possibility that Foucault may have said such things, alas! That is a different question, which would have to be treated separately. But as he is dead, I will not in my turn cite the judgment which, as I have been told by those who were close to him, Foucault is supposed to have made concerning the practice of Searle in this case and on the act that consisted in making this use of an alleged citation.” }}

In the main text he argued that Searle avoided reading him&lt;ref name=limitedinc&gt;Derrida, Jacques. ''Limited, Inc.''. Northwestern University Press, 1988. p. 29:
"...I have read some of his [Searle's] work (more, in any case, than he seems to have read of mine)"[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ANhg9zaAtIC]&lt;/ref&gt; and didn't try to understand him and even that, perhaps, he was not able to understand, and how certain practices of academic politeness or impoliteness could result in a form of brutality that he disapproved of and would like to disarm, in his fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Afterwords" in ''Limited, Inc.'' (Northwestern University Press, 1988), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida also criticized Searle's work for pretending to talk about "intention" without being aware of traditional texts about the subject and without even understanding Husserl's work when talking about it.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Afterwords" in ''Limited, Inc.'' (Northwestern University Press, 1988), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Because he ignored the tradition he rested blindly imprisoned in it, repeating its most problematic gestures, falling short of the most elementary critical questions.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "'Afterwords" in ''Limited, Inc.'' (Northwestern University Press, 1988), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida would even argue that in a certain way he was more close to Austin, than Searle that, in fact, was more close to continental philosophers that himself tried to criticize.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Afterwords" in ''Limited, Inc.'' (Northwestern University Press, 1988), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;
He would also argue about the problem he found in the constant appeal to "normality" in the analytical tradition from which Austin and Searle were only paradigmatic examples.&lt;ref name="Afterwordsp133" /&gt;

{{quotation| In the description of the structure called "normal," "normative," "central," "ideal,"this possibility must be integrated as an essential possibility. The possibility cannot be treated as though it were a simple accident-marginal or parasitic. It cannot be, and hence ought not to be, and this passage from can to ought reflects the entire difficulty. In the analysis of so-called normal cases, one neither can nor ought, in all theoretical rigor, to exclude the possibility of transgression. Not even provisionally, or out of allegedly methodological considerations. It would be a poor method, since this possibility of transgression tells us immediately and indispensably about the structure of the act said to be normal as well as about the structure of law in general.}}

He continued arguing how problematic was establishing the relation between "nonfiction or standard discourse" and "fiction," defined as its "parasite, “for part of the most originary essence of the latter is to allow fiction, the simulacrum, parasitism, to take place-and in so doing to "de-essentialize" itself as it were”.&lt;ref name="Afterwordsp133"&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Afterwords" in ''Limited, Inc.'' (Northwestern University Press, 1988), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; 
He would finally argue that the indispensable question would then become:&lt;ref name="Afterwordsp133" /&gt;
{{quotation|what is "nonfiction standard discourse," what must it be and what does this name evoke, once its fictionality or its fictionalization, its transgressive "parasitism," is always possible (and moreover by virtue of the very same words, the same phrases, the same grammar, etc.)? 
&lt;br&gt; This question is all the more indispensable since the rules, and even the statements of the rules governing the relations of "nonfiction standard discourse" and its fictional"parasites," are not things found in nature, but laws, symbolic inventions, or conventions, institutions that, in their very normality as well as in their normativity, entail something of the fictional.}}

The '''METEO System''' is a [[machine translation]] system specifically designed for the translation of the [[weather forecast]]s issued daily by [[Environment Canada]].&lt;ref name="Nirenburg1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sergei Nirenburg|title=Progress in machine translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGXIsTTAN1cC&amp;pg=PA246|accessdate=14 April 2010|year=1993|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-90-5199-074-4|pages=246–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was used from 1981 to 30 September 2001 by Environment Canada to translate forecasts issued in French in the province of [[Quebec]] into English and those issued in English in other [[Canadian province]]s into French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citt.gc.ca/procure/determin/pr2b029_e.asp#P90_10741 PROCUREMENT PROCESS by Canadian International Trade Tribunal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181412/http://www.citt.gc.ca/procure/determin/pr2b029_e.asp |date=2011-07-06 }}, July 30, 2002, consulted 2007-02-10&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a competitor program has replaced '''METEO System''' after an open governmental bid.

The system was developed by John Chandioux and was often mentioned{{by whom|date=October 2014}} as one of the few success stories in the field of machine translation. 

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
The METEO System was in operational use at Environment Canada from 1982 to 2001. It stems from a prototype developed in 1975-76 by the [[TAUM system|TAUM Group]], known as TAUM-METEO. 

The initial motivation to develop that prototype was that a junior translator came to TAUM to ask for help in translating weather bulletins at Environment Canada. Since all official communications emanating from the [[Canadian government]] must be available in French and English, because of the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]] of 1969, and weather bulletins represent a large amount of translation in real time, junior translators had to spend several months producing first draft translations, which were then revised by seniors.  That was a difficult and tedious job, because of the specificities of the English and French sublanguages used, and not very rewarding, as the lifetime of a bulletin is only 4 hours.

TAUM proposed to build a prototype MT system, and Environment Canada agreed to fund the project.  A prototype was ready after a few months, with basic integration in the [[workflow]] of translation (source and target bulletins travelled over [[telex]] lines at the time and MT happened on a [[mainframe computer]]).  The first version of the system (METEO 1) went into operation on a [[Control Data]] [[CDC 7600]] supercomputer in March 1977.

Chandioux then left the TAUM group to manage its operation and improve it, while the TAUM group embarked on a different project (TAUM-aviation, 1977–81).  Benoit Thouin made improvements to the initial prototype over the subsequent year, and turned it into an operational system.  After three years, METEO 1 had demonstrated the feasibility of microcomputer-based machine translation to the satisfaction of the Canadian government's Translation Bureau of [[Public Works and Government Services Canada]].

METEO 1 was formally adopted in 1981, replacing the junior translators in the workflow.  Because of the need for high quality translation, the ''revision'' step, done by senior translators, was maintained.  The quality, measured as the percentage of edit operations (inserting or deleting a word counts as 1, replacing as 2) on the MT results, reached 85% in 1985.

Until that time, the MT part was still implemented as a sequence of [[Q-systems]].  The Q-systems [[Formal grammar|formalism]] is a rule-based SLLP (Specialized Language for Linguistic Programming) invented by [[Alain Colmerauer]] in 1967 as he was a postdoc ''coopérant'' at the TAUM group. He later invented the [[Prolog]] language in 1972 after returning to France and becoming a university professor in Marseille-Luminy.

As the ''engine'' of the Q-systems is highly non-deterministic, and the manipulated data structures are in some ways too simple, without any types such as string or number, Chandioux encountered limitations in his efforts to raise translation quality and lower computation time to the point he could run it on microcomputers.

In 1981, Chandioux created a new SLLP, or ''metalanguage for linguistic applications'', based on the same basic algorithmic ideas as the Q-systems, but more deterministic, and offering typed labels on tree nodes.  Following the advice of Bernard Vauquois and Colmerauer, he created [[GRamR|Gram''R'']], and developed it for microcomputers.

In 1982, he could start developing in Gram''R '' a new system for translating the weather bulletins on a high-end [[Cromemco]] microcomputer.  METEO 2 went into operation in 1983.  The software then ran in 48Kb of central memory with a 5Mb hard disk for paging.  METEO 2 was the first MT application to run on a [[microcomputer]].

In 1985, the system had nothing left of the initial prototype, and was officially renamed [[METEO]].  It translated about 20 million words per year from English into French, and 10 million words from French into English, with a quality of 97%.  Typically, it took 4 minutes for a bulletin in English to be sent from [[Winnipeg]] and come back in French after MT and human revision.

In 1996, Chandioux developed a special version of his system (METEO 96) which was used to translate the weather forecasts (different kinds of bulletins) issued by the US [[National Weather Service]] during the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta.

The last known version of the system, METEO 5, dates from 1997 and ran on an [[IBM PC]] network under [[Windows NT]]. It translated 10 pages per second, but was able to fit into a 1.44Mb [[floppy disk]].

'''Mato Queimado''' is a Brazilian [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] located in the northwestern part of the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The population is 1,798 (2015 est.) in an area of 114.64&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref&gt;[http://cod.ibge.gov.br/2KQO Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística]&lt;/ref&gt; It is located 489&amp;nbsp;km west of the state capital of [[Porto Alegre]] and northeast of [[Alegrete]].

==Regional language== 
As is the case in many of its surrounding municipalities, listed below, the [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] language is spoken in Mato Queimado since pioneer days and has been intrinsic to its history. Although technically a language, it is commonly referred to as a dialect of the German language. In recent years the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] translation of its name is gaining wider use throughout Brazil: ''hunsriqueano riograndense'' (no caps in Port.). However, the majority of estimated three millions native speakers of Riograndenser Hunsrückisch in Rio Grande do Sul mostly often refer to their language simply as ''Deitsch'' or ''Hunsrückisch'', and the majority of them probably do not recognize the term ''hunsriqueano'', as used in academia and presently more and more in the larger cultural context (i.e. internet, social media, etc.).

The establishment of this community dates back to 1919, and its original settlers were all [[German Brazilian]], as well documented, most originating from the neighboring municipality of [[Cerro Largo, Rio Grande do Sul|Cerro Largo]] (then called ''Serro Azul'') and some from the eastern ''Altkolonie'' (trans.: Old Colony; in Port.: Colônia Velha) region of state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matoqueimado-rs.com.br/Arquivos/270/Conte%C3%BAdos/765/Hist%C3%B3rico%20do%20Munic%C3%ADpio_265J.pdf ''Histórico do Município de Mato Queimado'': Prefeitura Municipal, Mato Queimado, RS.] Website accessed on October 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, all the founders of the community were native speakers of the variety of Hunsrückisch spoken in the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], a Germanic language which is in fact uniquely Brazilian (there are two much smaller pockets of Hunsrückisch speakers in Brazil, located on the Atlantic coast of [[Santa Catarina state]] and in the mountains of the state of [[Espirito Santo]]).&lt;ref&gt;Altenhofen, Cléo Vilson: ''Hunsrückisch in Rio Grande do Sul, ein Beitrag zur Beschreibung einer deutschbrasilianischen Dialektvarietät im Kontakt mit dem Portugiesischen'', Meinzer Studien zur Sprach- und Volksforschung 21. Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Endangered status===
Although Riograndenser Hunsrückisch has a relatively large number of native speakers, the vast majority are also being fluent in the national language, many if not the majority of their children are not learning their parents mother tongue. This situation can be observed in Mato Queimado as well as in many localities with a similar profile found throughout the state of Rio Grande do Sul and also in neighboring regions outside the state where the language is spoken. However, there a few notable exceptions, as well documented by published research (See Altenhofen, cited above), affording some stability to this regional language. Nonetheless, given the overall language shift towards the dominant Brazilian language, Hunsrückisch has been officially classified as endangered for quite some time by world languages' monitoring organizations such as Ethnologue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/hrx ''Ethnologue, Languages of the World: Hunsrik, Hunsriker, Rio Grand Hunsriker'' (ISO 639-3 hrx). Population: 3,000,000. Classification: Indo-European, Germanic, West High German, German. Website accessed on October 27, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are many complex factors and interwoven dynamics that help explain the status quo of this language and its very pronounced lack of social prestige, centrally among them are the specific public policies enacted by Brazil's dictator [[Getúlio Vargas]] during [[II World War]] with his ''Nationalization Campaign'', the ''Campanha de Nacionalização'', which aimed aggressively at the eradication non-autochthonous minority languages both from public as well as privet life. Long after Vargas' linguistic legislation was officially suspended, its effect can still be observed among members of communities such as Mato Queimado (See [[Stigma management]]).

In some schools of Indian religions, ''moksha'' is considered equivalent to and used interchangeably with other terms such as ''vimoksha'', ''vimukti'', ''kaivalya'', ''apavarga'', ''mukti'', ''nihsreyasa'' and ''[[nirvana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism: "Vimoksha [解脱]" (Skt.; Jpn. ''gedatsu''). Emancipation, release, or liberation. The Sanskrit words vimukti, mukti, and ''moksha'' also have the same meaning. ''Vimoksha'' means release from the bonds of earthly desires, delusion, suffering, and transmigration. While Buddhism sets forth various kinds and stages of emancipation, or enlightenment, the supreme emancipation is nirvana, a state of perfect quietude, freedom, and deliverance. See [http://www.sgilibrary.org/search_dict.php?id=2602 ''The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism'', ''vimoksha''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222011614/http://www.sgilibrary.org/search_dict.php?id=2602 |date=22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, terms such as ''moksha'' and ''nirvana'' differ and mean different states between various schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.&lt;ref name=dltc&gt;See:

== Etymology ==

''Moksha'' is derived from the root {{lang-sa|मुच्}}, ''{{IAST|muc}}'', which means free, let go, release, liberate.&lt;ref name=mmw&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0800/mw__0853.html मुच] Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sten Rohde, Deliver us from Evil: studies on the Vedic ideas of salvation, Ejnar Munksgaard, Copenhagen, pp 25-35&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Veda]]s and early [[Upanishad]]s, the word {{lang-sa|मुच्यते}}, ''{{IAST|mucyate}}''&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt; appears, which means to be set free or release, such as of a horse from its harness.

== Definition and meanings ==

The definition and meaning of ''moksha'' varies between various schools of Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hiriyanna (2000), The essentials of Indian philosophy, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, pp 50-52&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moksha'' means freedom, liberation; from what and how is where the schools differ.&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; ''Moksha'' is also a concept that means liberation from rebirth or ''[[saṃsāra]]''.{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=113}} This liberation can be attained while one is on earth (''jivanmukti''), or [[Eschatology|eschatologically]] (''karmamukti'',{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=113}} ''[[Videha mukti|videhamukti]]''). Some Indian traditions have emphasized liberation on concrete, ethical action within the world. This liberation is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] transformation that permits one to see the truth and reality behind the fog of ignorance.&lt;ref group=web name="Brittanica" /&gt;

''Moksha'' has been defined not merely as absence of suffering and release from bondage to ''saṃsāra'', various schools of Hinduism also explain the concept as presence of the state of ''paripurna-brahmanubhava'' (the experience of oneness with [[Brahman]], the One Supreme Self), a state of knowledge, peace and bliss.&lt;ref&gt;see:

{{Quote|

&lt;poem&gt;
Beyond caste, creed, family or lineage,
That which is without name and form, beyond merit and demerit,
That which is beyond space, time and sense-objects,
You are that, God himself; Meditate this within yourself. ||Verse 254||
&lt;/poem&gt;

}}

Moksha has been defined in the book ''Sulightenment by Fathor''&lt;ref name="Fathor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brain Mechanic|first=Fathor|title=Sunlightenment: Science of Universe|year=2018|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sunlightenment-Science-Universe-Fathor-ebook/dp/B07KX3X393/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moksha is the State of Universe that having the liberation from the physical aspect. You liberate from the material aspects of life that you are in.''

=== Eschatological sense ===

''Moksha'' is a concept associated with ''saṃsāra'' (birth-rebirth cycle). ''Samsara'' originated with religious movements in the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref group=web name="Brittanica"/&gt; These movements such as Buddhism, Jainism and new schools within Hinduism, saw human life as bondage to a repeated process of rebirth. This bondage to repeated rebirth and life, each life subject to injury, disease and aging, was seen as a cycle of suffering. By release from this cycle, the [[suffering]] involved in this cycle also ended. This release was called ''moksha'', ''[[nirvana]]'', ''[[kaivalya]]'', ''mukti'' and other terms in various Indian religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Mishra, Moksha and the Hindu Worldview, Psychology &amp; Developing Societies, Vol. 25, Issue 1, pp 23, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eschatology|Eschatological]] ideas evolved in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;N. Ross Reat (1990), The Origins of Indian Psychology, {{ISBN|0-89581-924-4}}, Asian Humanities Press, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; In earliest Vedic literature, heaven and hell sufficed [[soteriology|soteriological]] curiosities. Over time, the ancient scholars observed that people vary in the quality of virtuous or sinful life they lead, and began questioning how differences in each person's ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|puṇya]]'' (merit, good deeds) or ''pāp'' (demerit, sin) as human beings affected their afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Simon Brodbeck (2011), Sanskrit Epics: The Ramayana, Mahabharata and Harivamsa, in Jessica Frazier (Editor) - The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-9966-0}}, pp 83-100
* J. A. B. Van Buitenen, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 33-40&lt;/ref&gt; This question led to the conception of an afterlife where the person stayed in heaven or hell, in proportion to their merit or demerit, then returned to earth and were reborn, the cycle continuing indefinitely. The rebirth idea ultimately flowered into the ideas of ''saṃsāra'', or transmigration - where one's balance sheet of ''[[karma]]'' determined one's rebirth. Along with this idea of ''saṃsāra'', the ancient scholars developed the concept of ''moksha'', as a state that released a person from the ''saṃsāra'' cycle. ''Moksha'' release in eschatological sense in these ancient literature of Hinduism, suggests [[J. A. B. van Buitenen|van Buitenen]],&lt;ref name=jabvb&gt;J. A. B. Van Buitenen, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 33-40&lt;/ref&gt; comes from self-knowledge and consciousness of oneness of supreme soul.

=== Epistemological and psychological senses ===

Scholars provide various explanations of the meaning of ''moksha'' in epistemological and psychological senses. For example, Deutsche sees ''moksha'' as transcendental consciousness, the perfect state of being, of self-realization, of freedom and of "realizing the whole universe as the Self".&lt;ref&gt;E. Deutsch, The self in Advaita Vedanta, in Roy Perrett (Editor), Indian philosophy: metaphysics, Volume 3, {{ISBN|0-8153-3608-X}}, Taylor and Francis, pp 343-360&lt;/ref&gt;

''Moksha'' in Hinduism, suggests [[Klaus Klostermaier]],&lt;ref name=klausklost&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pp. 61-71&lt;/ref&gt; implies a setting-free of hitherto fettered faculties, a removing of obstacles to an unrestricted life, permitting a person to be more truly a person in the full sense; the concept presumes an unused human potential of creativity, compassion and understanding which had been blocked and shut out. ''Moksha'' is more than liberation from a life-rebirth cycle of suffering (''samsara''); the Vedantic school separates this into two: ''jivanmukti'' (liberation in this life) and ''videhamukti'' (liberation after death).&lt;ref&gt;see:
* M. von Brück (1986), Imitation or Identification?, Indian Theological Studies, Vol. 23, Issue 2, pp 95-105
* Klaus Klostermaier, Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pp. 61-71&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moksha'' in this life includes psychological liberation from ''adhyasa'' (fears besetting one's life) and ''avidya'' (ignorance or anything that is not true knowledge).&lt;ref name=klausklost/&gt;

==== As a state of perfection ====

[[File:Gajendra Moksha print.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Gajendra Moksha]] (pictured) is a symbolic tale in [[Vaishnavism]]. The elephant Gajendra enters a lake where a crocodile (Huhu) clutches his leg and becomes his suffering. Despite his pain, Gajendra constantly remembers Vishnu, who then liberates him. Gajendra symbolically represents human beings, Huhu represents sins, and the lake is saṃsāra.]]
Many schools of Hinduism according to [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]],&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; see ''moksha'' as a state of perfection. The concept was seen as a natural goal beyond ''dharma''. ''Moksha'', in the epics and ancient literature of Hinduism, is seen as achievable by the same techniques necessary to practice ''dharma''. Self-discipline is the path to ''dharma'', ''moksha'' is self-discipline that is so perfect that it becomes unconscious, second nature. ''Dharma'' is thus a means to ''moksha''.&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Karl Potter, Dharma and Mokṣa from a Conversational Point of View, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 8, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1958), pp. 49-63
* Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 41-48&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Samkhya]] school of Hinduism, for example, suggests that one of the paths to ''moksha'' is to magnify one's ''[[sattva]]m''.&lt;ref&gt;One of three qualities or habits of an individual; sattvam represents spiritual purity; sattvic people, claims Samkhya school, are those who see world's welfare as a spiritual principle. See cited Ingalls reference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dhhi45&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; To magnify one's ''sattvam'', one must develop oneself where one's ''sattvam'' becomes one's instinctive nature. Many schools of Hinduism thus understood ''dharma'' and ''moksha'' as two points of a single journey of life, a journey for which the ''[[viaticum]]'' was discipline and self-training.&lt;ref name=dhhi45/&gt; Over time, these ideas about ''moksha'' were challenged.

==== Nagarjuna's challenge ====

''Dharma'' and ''moksha'', suggested [[Nagarjuna]] in the 2nd century, cannot be goals on the same journey.&lt;ref name=dhhi46&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 46&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed to the differences between the world we live in, and the freedom implied in the concept of ''moksha''. They are so different that ''dharma'' and ''moksha'' could not be intellectually related. ''Dharma'' requires worldly thought, ''moksha'' is unworldly understanding, a state of bliss. How can the worldly thought-process lead to unworldly understanding? asked Nagarjuna.&lt;ref name=dhhi46/&gt; Karl Potter explains the answer to this challenge as one of context and framework, the emergence of broader general principles of understanding from thought processes that are limited in one framework.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter, Dharma and Mokṣa from a Conversational Point of View, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 8, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1958), pp. 49-63&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adi Shankara's challenge ====

[[Adi Shankara]] in the 8th century AD, like Nagarjuna earlier, examined the difference between the world one lives in and ''moksha'', a state of freedom and release one hopes for.&lt;ref name=dhhi47&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Nagarjuna, Shankara considers the characteristics between the two. The world one lives in requires action as well as thought; our world, he suggests, is impossible without ''vyavahara'' (action and plurality). The world is interconnected, one object works on another, input is transformed into output, change is continuous and everywhere. ''Moksha'', suggests Shankara,&lt;ref name=klausklost/&gt; is that final perfect, blissful state where there can be no change, where there can be no plurality of states. It has to be a state of thought and consciousness that excludes action.&lt;ref name=dhhi47/&gt; How can action-oriented techniques by which we attain the first three goals of man (''kama'', ''artha'' and ''dharma'') be useful to attain the last goal, namely ''moksha''?

Scholars&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp 41-48
* R Sinari (1982), The concept of human estrangement in plotinism and Shankara Vedanta, in "Neoplatonism and Indian thought", Ed: R.B. Harris, Albany, NY, pp 243-255
* R.K. Tripathi (1982), Advaita Vedanta and Neoplatonism, in "Neoplatonism and Indian thought", Ed: R.B. Harris, Albany, NY, pp 237; also see pp 294-297 by Albert Wolters&lt;/ref&gt; suggest Shankara's challenge to the concept of ''moksha'' parallels those of [[Plotinus]] against the Gnostics, with one important difference:&lt;ref name=dhhi47/&gt; Plotinus accused the Gnostics of exchanging an anthropocentric set of virtues with a theocentric set in pursuit of salvation; Shankara challenged that the concept of ''moksha'' implied an exchange of anthropocentric set of virtues (''dharma'') with a blissful state that has no need for values. Shankara goes on to suggest that anthropocentric virtues suffice.

==== The Vaisnavas' challenge ====

[[Vaishnavism]], one of the ''[[Bhakti yoga|bhakti]]'' schools of Hinduism, is devoted to the worship of God, sings his name, anoints his image or idol, and has many sub-schools. Vaishnavas (followers of Vaishnavism) suggest that ''dharma'' and ''moksha'' cannot be two different or sequential goals or states of life.&lt;ref name=dhhi48&gt;
Daniel H. H. Ingalls, "Dharma and Moksha", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 48
&lt;/ref&gt;
Instead, they suggest God should be kept in mind constantly to simultaneously achieve ''dharma'' and ''moksha'', so constantly that one comes to feel one cannot live without God's loving presence. This school emphasized love and adoration of God as the path to "moksha" (salvation and release), rather than works and knowledge. Their focus became divine virtues, rather than anthropocentric virtues. [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]]&lt;ref name=dhhi48/&gt; regards Vaishnavas' position on ''moksha'' as similar to the Christian position on salvation, and Vaishnavism as the school whose views on ''dharma'', ''karma'' and ''moksha'' dominated the initial impressions and colonial-era literature on Hinduism, through the works of Thibaut, [[Max Müller]] and others.

== History ==

The concept of ''moksha'' appears much later in ancient Indian literature than the concept of ''dharma''. The proto-concept that first appears in the ancient Sanskrit verses and early Upanishads is ''mucyate'', which means freed or released. It is the middle and later Upanishads, such as the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|Svetasvatara]] and [[Maitrayaniya Upanishad|Maitri]], where the word ''moksha'' appears and begins becoming an important concept.&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Klaus Klostermaier (1985), Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, 35 (1), pp 61-71

[[Katha Upanishad|Kathaka Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called Katha Upanishad - for example, by Max Muller, Nakhilananda&lt;/ref&gt; a middle Upanishadic era script dated to be about 2500 years old, is among the earliest expositions about ''saṃsāra'' and ''moksha''. In Book I, Section III, the legend of boy Naciketa queries [[Yama]], the lord of death to explain what causes ''saṃsāra'' and what leads to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-0842616454}}, pp 269-290&lt;/ref&gt; Naciketa inquires: what causes sorrow? Yama explains that suffering and ''saṃsāra'' results from a life that is lived absent-mindedly, with impurity, with neither the use of intelligence nor self-examination, where neither mind nor senses are guided by one's ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atma]]'' (soul, self).&lt;ref name=oxfordatmandef&gt;'''[a]''' [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/atman Atman], Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press (2012), '''Quote''': "1. real self of the individual; 2. a person's soul";&lt;br&gt;'''[b]''' John Bowker (2000), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0192800947}}, See entry for Atman;&lt;br&gt;'''[c]''' WJ Johnson (2009), A Dictionary of Hinduism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198610250}}, See entry for Atman (self).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=3defsatman&gt;'''[a]''' David Lorenzen (2004), The Hindu World (Editors: Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415215277}}, pages 208-209, '''Quote''': "Advaita and nirguni movements, on the other hand, stress an interior mysticism in which the devotee seeks to discover the identity of individual soul (atman) with the universal ground of being (brahman) or to find god within himself".;&lt;br&gt;'''[b]''' Richard King (1995), Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791425138}}, page 64, '''Quote:''' "Atman as the innermost essence or soul of man, and Brahman as the innermost essence and support of the universe. (...) Thus we can see in the Upanishads, a tendency towards a convergence of microcosm and macrocosm, culminating in the equating of atman with Brahman".&lt;br&gt;'''[c]''' Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, page 63; '''Quote''': "Even though Buddhism explicitly rejected the Hindu ideas of ''Atman'' (soul) and Brahman, Hinduism treats Sakyamuni Buddha as one of the ten avatars of Vishnu."&lt;/ref&gt; Liberation comes from a life lived with inner purity, alert mind, led by ''buddhi'' (reason, intelligence), realization of the Supreme Self (''purusha'') who dwells in all beings. Kathaka Upanishad asserts knowledge liberates, knowledge is freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-0842616454}}, pp 283-289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Nikhilananda, The Principal Upanishads, Dover Publications, {{ISBN|978-0486427171}}, pp 63-84&lt;/ref&gt; Kathaka Upanishad also explains the role of yoga in personal liberation, ''moksha''.

[[Svetasvatara Upanishad]], another middle era Upanishad written after Kathaka Upanishad, begins with questions such as why is man born, what is the primal cause behind the universe, what causes joy and sorrow in life?&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-0842616454}}, pp 301-326&lt;/ref&gt; It then examines the various theories, that were then existing, about saṃsāra and release from bondage. Svetasvatara claims&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-0842616454}}, pp 316, 319-325&lt;/ref&gt; bondage results from ignorance, illusion or delusion; deliverance comes from knowledge. The Supreme Being dwells in every being, he is the primal cause, he is the eternal law, he is the essence of everything, he is nature, he is not a separate entity. Liberation comes to those who know Supreme Being is present as the Universal Spirit and Principle, just as they know butter is present in milk. Such realization, claims Svetasvatara, come from self-knowledge and self-discipline; and this knowledge and realization is liberation from transmigration, the final goal of the Upanishad.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-0842616454}}, pp 305-306, 322-325&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the middle Upanishad era, ''moksha'' - or equivalent terms such as ''mukti'' and ''kaivalya'' - is a major theme in many [[Upanishad]]s. For example, Sarasvati Rahasya Upanishad, one of several Upanishads of the [[Bhakti yoga|bhakti school]] of Hinduism, starts out with prayers to Goddess Sarasvati. She is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, learning and creative arts;&lt;ref name=jbrl/&gt; her name is a compound word of ‘‘sara’’&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=sAra&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 सार] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; and ‘‘sva’’,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=sva&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 स्व] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "essence of self". After the prayer verses, the Upanishad inquires about the secret to freedom and liberation (mukti). Sarasvati's reply in the Upanishad is:
{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
It was through me the Creator himself gained liberating knowledge,
I am being, consciousness, bliss, eternal freedom: unsullied, unlimited, unending.
My perfect consciousness shines your world, like a beautiful face in a soiled mirror,
Seeing that reflection I wish myself you, an individual soul, as if I could be finite!

A finite soul, an infinite Goddess - these are false concepts,
in the minds of those unacquainted with truth,
No space, my loving devotee, exists between your self and my self,
Know this and you are free. This is the secret wisdom.
&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Evolution of the concept ===

The concept of ''moksha'', according to [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]],&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; represented one of many expansions in Hindu Vedic ideas of life and afterlife. In the Vedas, there were three [[Ashrama (stage)|stages]] of life: studentship, householdship and retirement. During the Upanishadic era, Hinduism expanded this to include a fourth stage of life: [[Sannyasa|complete abandonment]]. In Vedic literature, there are three modes of experience: waking, dream and deep sleep. The Upanishadic era expanded it to include ''turiyam'' - the stage beyond deep sleep. The Vedas suggest three goals of man: [[kama]], [[artha]] and [[dharma]]. To these, the Upanishadic era added ''moksha''.&lt;ref name=danielingalls&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 41-48&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance of the concept of ''moksha'' in some schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] was slow. These refused to recognize ''moksha'' for centuries, considering it irrelevant.&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; The Mimamsa school, for example, denied the goal and relevance of ''moksha'' well into the 8th century AD, until the arrival of a Mimamsa scholar named [[Kumarila]].&lt;ref&gt;see:

* Okita, K. (2008), Mīmāṃsā and Vedānta: Interaction and Continuity, The Journal of Hindu Studies, 1(1-2), pp 155-156&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of ''moksha'', Mimamsa school of Hinduism considered the concept of heaven as sufficient to answer the question: what lay beyond this world after death. Other schools of Hinduism, over time, accepted the ''moksha'' concept and refined it over time.&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt;

It is unclear when the core ideas of samsara and ''moksha'' were developed in ancient India. Patrick Olivelle suggests these ideas likely originated with new religious movements in the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref group=web name="Brittanica"&gt;[[Patrick Olivelle]] (2012), Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387852/moksha ''Moksha (Indian religions)'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mukti'' and ''moksha'' ideas, suggests [[J. A. B. van Buitenen]],&lt;ref name=jabvb/&gt; seem traceable to yogis in Hinduism, with long hair, who chose to live on the fringes of society, given to self-induced states of intoxication and ecstasy, possibly accepted as medicine men and "sadhus" by the ancient Indian society.&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; ''Moksha'' to these early concept developers, was the abandonment of the established order, not in favor of anarchy, but in favor of self-realization, to achieve release from this world.&lt;ref&gt;J.A.B. van Buitenen, in Roy Perrett (Editor) - Theory of Value, Volume 5, {{ISBN|0-8153-3612-8}}, Taylor &amp; Francis, pp 25-32&lt;/ref&gt;

In its historical development, the concept of ''moksha'' appears in three forms: Vedic, yogic and bhakti. In the Vedic period, ''moksha'' was ritualistic.&lt;ref name=jabvb/&gt; Mokṣa was claimed to result from properly completed rituals such as those before ''Agni'' - the fire deity. The significance of these rituals was to reproduce and recite the cosmic creation event described in the Vedas; the description of knowledge on different levels - ''adhilokam'', ''adhibhutam'', ''adhiyajnam'', ''adhyatmam'' - helped the individual transcend to moksa. Knowledge was the means, the ritual its application. By the middle to late Upanishadic period, the emphasis shifted to knowledge, and ritual activities were considered irrelevant to the attainment of ''moksha''.&lt;ref name=amalinar&gt;Angelika Malinar (2011), in Jessica Frazier (Editor), The Bloomsbury companion to Hindu studies, {{ISBN|978-1-4725-1151-5}}, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoga|Yogic]] ''moksha''&lt;ref name=jabvb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobson, in Jessica Frazier (Editor), Continuum companion to Hindu studies, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-9966-0}}, pp 74-82&lt;/ref&gt; replaced Vedic rituals with personal development and meditation, with hierarchical creation of the ultimate knowledge in self as the path to ''moksha''. Yogic ''moksha'' principles were accepted in many other schools of Hinduism, albeit with differences. For example, [[Adi Shankara]] in his book on ''moksha'' suggests:
{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
अर्थस्य निश्चयो दृष्टो विचारेण हितोक्तितः |
न स्नानेन न दानेन प्राणायमशतेन वा || १३ ||

By reflection, reasoning and instructions of teachers, the truth is known,

}}
Bhakti ''moksha'' created the third historical path, where neither rituals nor meditative self-development were the way, rather it was inspired by constant love and contemplation of God, which over time results in a perfect union with God.&lt;ref name=jabvb/&gt; Some Bhakti schools evolved their ideas where God became the means and the end, transcending ''moksha''; the fruit of bhakti is bhakti itself.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (1986), Contemporary conceptions among North Indian Vaishnavas, in Ronald Neufeldt (Editor) - Karma and Rebirth Post Classical Developments, {{ISBN|978-0873959902}}, State University of New York Press, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; In the history of Indian religious traditions, additional ideas and paths to ''moksha'' beyond these three, appeared over time.&lt;ref&gt;D.

==Synonyms==

The words ''moksha'', nirvana (''nibbana'') and [[kaivalya]] are sometimes used synonymously,&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Adhyatma Upanishad uses all three words nirvana, kaivalya and ''moksha'' (Verses 12, 16, 69, 70); K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), [[:iarchive:thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft|Thirty Minor Upanishads]], University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada, pp 55-60&lt;/ref&gt; because they all refer to the state that liberates a person from all causes of sorrow and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;A.

Kaivalya, a concept akin to ''moksha'', rather than nirvana, is found in some schools of Hinduism such as the Yoga school. Kaivalya is the realization of aloofness with liberating knowledge of one's self and union with the spiritual universe. For example, [[Patanjali]]’s Yoga Sutra suggests:
{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
तस्य हेतुरविद्या,
तदभावात्संयोगाभावो हानं तद् दृशेः कैवल्यम् |

After the dissolution of avidya (ignorance),
comes removal of communion with material world,
this is the path to Kaivalyam.

Nirvana and ''moksha'', in all traditions, represents a state of being in ultimate reality and perfection, but described in a very different way. Some scholars, states Jayatilleke, assert that the Nirvana of Buddhism is same as the [[Brahman]] in Hinduism, a view other scholars and he disagree with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K.N.

== Hinduism ==

Ancient literature of different schools of Hinduism sometimes use different phrases for ''moksha''. For example, ''Keval jnana'' or ''[[kaivalya]]'' ("state of Absolute"), ''Apavarga'', ''Nihsreyasa'', ''Paramapada'', ''Brahmabhava'', ''Brahmajnana'' and ''[[Brahmi sthiti]]''. Modern literature additionally uses the Buddhist term nirvana interchangeably with ''moksha'' of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=pjaini/&gt;&lt;ref name=davidloy/&gt; There is difference between these ideas, as explained elsewhere in this article, but they are all [[soteriology|soteriological]] concepts of various Indian religious traditions.

The six major orthodox schools of Hinduism have had a historic debate, and disagree over whether ''moksha'' can be achieved in this life, or only after this life.&lt;ref name=asharma&gt;A. Sharma (2000), Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195644418}}, pp 117&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the 108 Upanishads discuss amongst other things ''moksha''. These discussions show the differences between the schools of Hinduism, a lack of consensus, with a few attempting to conflate the contrasting perspectives between various schools.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, freedom and deliverance from birth-rebirth, argues Maitrayana Upanishad, comes neither from the Vedanta school's doctrine (the knowledge of one's own Self as the Supreme Soul) nor from the Samkhya school's doctrine (distinction of the Purusha from what one is not), but from Vedic studies, observance of the ''Svadharma'' (personal duties), sticking to ''Asramas'' (stages of life).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1468-4}}, pp 342&lt;/ref&gt;

The six major orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy offer the following views on ''moksha'', each for their own reasons: the Nyaya, Vaisesika and Mimamsa schools of Hinduism consider ''moksha'' as possible only after death.&lt;ref name=asharma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: Each school has a different meaning for ''moksha''. For example, Mimamsa school considers ''moksha'' as release into ''svarga'' (heaven), it does not recognize samsara; while Nyaya school considers ''moksha'' as linked to samsara and a release from it; See: [[:iarchive:mimamsasutra00jaimuoft|The Purva-Mimamsa Sutra of Jaimini]], Transl: M.L. Sandal (1923), Chapter II, Pada I and Chapter VI, Pada I through VIII; Also see Klaus Klostermaier, A Survey of Hinduism, 3rd Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7082-4}}, Chapter 26&lt;/ref&gt; Samkhya and Yoga schools consider ''moksha'' as possible in this life. In Vedanta school, the Advaita sub-school concludes ''moksha'' is possible in this life,&lt;ref name=asharma/&gt; while Dvaita and Visistadvaita sub-schools of Vedanta tradition believes that ''moksha'' is a continuous event, one assisted by loving devotion to God, that extends from this life to post-mortem. Beyond these six orthodox schools, some heterodox schools of Hindu tradition, such as Carvaka, deny there is a soul or after life ''moksha''.&lt;ref&gt;see:

=== Sāmkhya, Yoga and mokṣa ===

Both Sāmkhya and Yoga systems of religious thought are ''mokshaśāstras'', suggests [[:no:Knut A. Jacobsen|Knut Jacobsen]], they are systems of salvific liberation and release.&lt;ref name=kjacobson&gt;Knut Jacobson, in Jessica Frazier (Editor), Continuum companion to Hindu studies, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-9966-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sāmkhya is a system of interpretation, primarily a theory about the world. Yoga is both a theory and a practice. Yoga gained wide acceptance in ancient India, its ideas and practices became part of many religious schools in Hinduism, including those that were very different from Sāmkhya. The eight limbs of yoga can be interpreted as a way to liberation (''moksha'').&lt;ref name=kjacobson/&gt;&lt;ref name=kjjf/&gt;

In Sāmkhya literature, liberation is commonly referred to as ''kaivalya''. In this school, kaivalya means the realization of ''purusa'', the principle of consciousness, as independent from mind and body, as different from ''prakrti''. Like many schools of Hinduism, in Sāmkhya and Yoga schools, the emphasis is on the attainment of knowledge, ''vidyā'' or ''jñāna'', as necessary for salvific liberation, ''moksha''.&lt;ref name=kjacobson/&gt;&lt;ref name=jgold&gt;Jeffrey Gold, Plato in the Light of Yoga, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 46, No. 1 (Jan., 1996), pp. 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga's purpose is then seen as a means to remove the ''avidyā'' - that is, ignorance or misleading/incorrect knowledge about one self and the universe. It seeks to end ordinary reflexive awareness (''cittavrtti nirodhah'') with deeper, purer and holistic awareness (''asamprājñāta samādhi'').&lt;ref name=kjjf&gt;Knut Jacobsen (2011), in Jessica Frazier (Editor), The Bloomsbury companion to Hindu studies, {{ISBN|978-1-4725-1151-5}}, pp 74-82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Sinari, The way toward Moksa, in Murty et al. (Editors) - Freedom, Progress &amp; Society, {{ISBN|81-208-0262-4}}, pp 45-60&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga, during the pursuit of ''moksha'', encourages practice (''abhyāsa'') with detachment (''vairāgya''), which over time leads to deep concentration (''samādhi''). Detachment means withdrawal from outer world and calming of mind, while practice means the application of effort over time. Such steps are claimed by Yoga school as leading to samādhi, a state of deep awareness, release and bliss called ''kaivalya''.&lt;ref name=kjacobson/&gt;&lt;ref name=jgold/&gt;

=== Vedanta and mokṣa ===
{{Main article|Vedanta}}
The three main sub-schools in Vedanta school of Hinduism - [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Vishistadvaita]] and [[Dvaita]] - each have their own views about ''moksha''.

The Vedantic school of Hinduism suggests the first step towards mokṣa begins with ''mumuksutva'', that is desire of liberation.&lt;ref name=klausklost/&gt; This takes the form of questions about self, what is true, why do things or events make us happy or cause suffering, and so on. This longing for liberating knowledge is assisted by, claims [[Adi Shankara]] of Advaita Vedanta,&lt;ref&gt;Shankara, Sarva vedanta siddhantasara 230-239&lt;/ref&gt; [[guru]] (teacher), study of historical knowledge and [[viveka]] (critical thinking). Shankara cautions that the guru and historic knowledge may be distorted, so traditions and historical assumptions must be questioned by the individual seeking ''moksha''. Those who are on their path to ''moksha'' (samnyasin), suggests [[Klaus Klostermaier]], are quintessentially free individuals, without craving for anything in the worldly life, thus are neither dominated by, nor dominating anyone else.&lt;ref name=klausklost/&gt;

[[Vivekachudamani]], which literally means "Crown Jewel of Discriminatory Reasoning", is a book devoted to moksa in Vedanta philosophy. It explains what behaviors and pursuits lead to ''moksha'', as well what actions and assumptions hinder ''moksha''. The four essential conditions, according to Vivekachudamani, before one can commence on the path of ''moksha'' include (1) ''vivekah'' (discrimination, critical reasoning) between everlasting principles and fleeting world; (2) ''viragah'' (indifference, lack of craving) for material rewards; (3) ''samah'' (calmness of mind), and (4) ''damah'' (self restraint, [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]]).&lt;ref&gt;D. Datta  (1888), Moksha, or the Vedántic Release, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, New Series, Vol. 20, No. 4 (Oct., 1888), pp. 516&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' adds to the above four requirements, the following: ''uparati'' (lack of bias, dispassion), ''titiksa'' (endurance, patience), ''sraddha'' (faith) and ''[[samadhana]]'' (intentness, commitment).&lt;ref name=edav/&gt;

The [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] tradition considers ''moksha'' achievable by removing [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]] (ignorance). ''Moksha'' is seen as a final release from illusion, and through knowledge (''[[Anubhava (Hindu thought)|anubhava]]'') of one's own fundamental nature, which is [[Satcitananda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brodd | first = Jefferey | title = World Religions | publisher = Saint Mary's Press | year = 2003 | location = Winona, MN | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-88489-725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The description comprises the three [[Sanskrit]] words ''sat-chit-ananda'':

Web. 24 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Dualist schools (e.g. [[Vaishnava]]) see God as the object of love, for example, a personified monotheistic conception of [[Shiva]] or [[Vishnu]]. By immersing oneself in the love of God, one's [[karma]]s slough off, one's illusions decay, and truth is lived.  Both the worshiped and worshiper gradually lose their illusory sense of separation and only One beyond all names remains. This is salvation to dualist schools of Hinduism. Dvaita Vedanta emphasizes [[Bhakti Yoga]] as the means of achieving ''moksha''.&lt;ref&gt;N.S.S. Raman (2009), Ethics in Bhakti Philosophical Literature, in R.

The [[Vishistadvaita]] tradition, led by [[Ramanuja]], defines avidya and ''moksha'' differently from the Advaita tradition. To Ramanuja, avidya is a focus on the self, and vidya is a focus on a loving god. The Vishistadvaita school argues that other schools of Hinduism create a false sense of agency in individuals, which makes the individual think oneself as potential or self-realized god. Such ideas, claims Ramanuja, decay to materialism, hedonism and self worship. Individuals forget ''Ishvara'' (God). Mukti, to Vishistadvaita school, is release from such avidya, towards the intuition and eternal union with God ([[Vishnu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Abha Singh (October 2001), Social Philosophy of Ramanuja: its modern relevance, ''Indian Philosophical Quarterly'', Vol. 28, No. 4, pp 491–498&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mokṣa in this life ===

Among the Samkhya, Yoga and Vedanta schools of Hinduism, liberation and freedom reached within one's life is referred to as ''jivanmukti'', and the individual who has experienced this state is called ''[[jivanmukta]]'' (self-realized person).&lt;ref&gt;see:

For example, according to Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad, the liberated individual shows attributes such as:&lt;ref&gt;see:

* he doesn’t care about or wear ṣikha (tuft of hair on the back of head for religious reasons), nor the holy thread across his body. To him, knowledge is sikha, knowledge is the holy thread, knowledge alone is supreme. Outer appearances and rituals do not matter to him, only knowledge matters;
* for him there is no invocation nor dismissal of deities, no mantra nor non-mantra, no prostrations nor worship of gods, goddess or ancestors, nothing other than knowledge of Self;
* he is humble, high-spirited, of clear and steady mind, straightforward, compassionate, patient, indifferent, courageous, speaks firmly and with sweet words.

When a Jivanmukta dies he achieves Paramukti and becomes a Paramukta. Jivanmukta experience enlightenment and liberation while alive and also after death i.e., after becoming paramukta, while Videhmukta experiences enlightenment and liberation only after death.

=== Mokṣa in Balinese Hinduism ===

Balinese Hinduism incorporates ''moksha'' as one of five [[Tattva|tattwas]]. The other four are: ''brahman'' (the one supreme god head, not to be confused with Brahmin), ''atma'' (soul or spirit), [[karma]] (actions and reciprocity, causality), ''samsara'' (principle of rebirth, reincarnation). ''Moksha'', in Balinese Hindu belief, is the possibility of unity with the divine; it is sometimes referred to as nirwana.&lt;ref&gt;Balinese Hindus spell words slightly differently from Indian Hindus; tattva in India is spelled tattwa in Bali, nirvana in India is spelled nirwana in Bali, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anettheim&gt;Anna Nettheim (2011), [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:10091/SOURCE02 Tattwa are the words of the world: Balinese narratives and creative transformation], Ph.D. Thesis, University of New South Wales, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Nirvana|Rebirth (Buddhism)}}

In [[Buddhism]] the term "moksha" is uncommon, but an equivalent term is ''vimutti'', "release". In the suttas two forms of release are mentioned, namely ''ceto-vimutti'', "deliverance of mind," and ''panna-vimutti'', "deliverance through wisdom" (insight). ''Ceto-vimutti''  is related to the practice of dhyana, while ''panna-vimutti'' is related to the development of insight. According to Gombrich, the distinction may be a later development, which resulted in a change of doctrine, regarding the practice of [[Dhyana in Buddhism|dhyana]] to be insufficient for final liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, ''The Conditioned genesis of Buddhism'', chapter four: "How Insight Worstened Concentration"&lt;/ref&gt;

With release comes Nirvana (Pali: Nibbana), “blowing out”, "quenching", or “becoming extinguished” of the fires of the passions and of self-view.&lt;ref name="Collins2010p63"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins |title=Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5pshUYiUVwC |year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-88198-2 |pages=63–64, 33–34, 47–50, 74–75, 106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, "What the Buddha thought"&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "timeless state" in which there is no more [[Samsara|becoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins |title=Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5pshUYiUVwC |year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-88198-2 |page=31}}, '''Quote:''' "This general scheme remained basic to later Hinduism, to Jainism, and to Buddhism. Eternal salvation, to use the Christian term, is not conceived of as world without end; we have already got that, called samsara, the world of rebirth and redeath: that is the problem, not the solution. The ultimate aim is the timeless state of ''moksha'', or as the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it, nirvana."&lt;/ref&gt;

Nirvana ends the cycle of ''[[Dukkha]]'' and rebirth in the six realms of [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)]].&lt;ref name="Gethin1998p74"/&gt;&lt;!--** START OF NOTE ("NIRODHA") **--&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Nirodha"|Ending rebirth:&lt;br&gt;* Graham Harvey: "The Third Noble Truth is nirvana.

It represented salvation from samsara precisely because it was understood to comprise a state of complete freedom from the chain of samsaric causes and conditions, i.e., precisely because it was unconditioned (''asamskrta'')."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=27-28}}&lt;br&gt;* Walpola Rahula: "Let us consider a few definitions and descriptions of Nirvana as found in the original Pali texts [...] 'It is the complete cessation of that very thirst (tanha), giving it up, renouncing it, emancipation from it, detachment from it.'

{{Main article|Moksha (Jainism)}}
In [[Jainism]], ''moksha'' and ''nirvana'' are one and the same.&lt;ref name=pjaini&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }}: ''"Moksa and Nirvana are synonymous in Jainism".'' p.168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carrithers, Caroline Humphrey (1991) ''The Assembly of listeners: Jains in society'' Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521365058}}: ''"Nirvana: A synonym for liberation, release, moksa."'' p.297&lt;/ref&gt; Jaina texts sometimes use the term ''Kevalya'', and call the liberated soul as ''Kevalin''.&lt;ref name=pauldundastjp104/&gt; As with all Indian religions, ''moksha'' is the ultimate spiritual goal in Jainism. It defines ''moksha'' as the spiritual release from all karma.&lt;ref name=pauldundastjp104&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 104–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jainism is a [[Sramana|Sramanic]] non-theistic philosophy, that like Hinduism and unlike Buddhism, believes in a metaphysical permanent self or [[soul]] often termed ''[[Jīva (Jainism)|jiva]]''. Jaina believe that this soul is what transmigrates from one being to another at the time of death. The ''moksa'' state is attained when a soul (''[[Ātman (Jainism)|atman]]'') is liberated from the cycles of deaths and rebirths (''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]''), is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a ''[[siddha]]''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=222-223}} In Jainism, it is believed to be a stage beyond enlightenment and ethical perfection, states [[Paul Dundas]], because they can perform physical and mental activities such as teach, without accruing karma that leads to rebirth.&lt;ref name=pauldundastjp104/&gt;

Jaina traditions believe that there exist ''Abhavya'' (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain ''moksha'' (liberation).{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=226}}&lt;ref name=pauldundastjp104/&gt; The ''Abhavya'' state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act,{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=225}} but Jaina texts also polemically applied ''Abhavya'' condition to those who belonged to a competing ancient Indian tradition called ''[[Ājīvika]]''.&lt;ref name=pauldundastjp104/&gt; A male human being is considered closest to the apex of ''moksha'', with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. The ability of women to attain ''moksha'' has been historically debated, and the subtraditions with Jainism have disagreed. In the [[Digambara]] tradition of Jainism, women must live an ethical life and gain karmic merit to be reborn as a man, because only males can achieve spiritual liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajAEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36|year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85773-656-7|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harveyp182&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Harvey |title=Religions in Focus: New Approaches to Tradition and Contemporary Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrTsCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182|year=2016|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-93690-8|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Śvētāmbara]] tradition has believed that women too can attain ''moksha'' just like men.&lt;ref name=harveyp182/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 55–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Padmanabh S.

== Sikhism ==
The [[Sikh]] concept of mukti (''moksha'') is similar to other Indian religions, and refers to spiritual liberation.&lt;ref name=teece17/&gt; It is described in Sikhism as the state that breaks the cycle of rebirths.&lt;ref name=teece17&gt;Geoff Teece (2004), Sikhism: Religion in focus, {{ISBN|978-1-58340-469-0}}, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Mukti is obtained according to Sikhism, states Singha, through "God's grace".&lt;ref name=hssingha54&gt;HS Singha (2009),Sikhism: A Complete Introduction, Hemkunt Press, {{ISBN|978-8170102458}}, pages 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the devotion to God is viewed as more important than the desire for ''Mukti''.&lt;ref name=hssingha54/&gt;

{{Quote|

'''Monoculture''' is the [[agriculture|agricultural]] practice of producing or growing a single [[crop]], plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time. [[Polyculture]], where more than one crop is grown in the same space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2eh7vyvuscC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=crop+ecology+loomis+connor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=whxAVZ3ZOI-sogSy9YHICQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=crop%20ecology%20loomis%20connor&amp;f=false|title=Crop Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monoculture is widely used in both [[industrial farming]] and [[organic farming]] and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest.

Continuous monoculture, or [[monocropping]], where the same species is grown year after year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cropscience.org.au/icsc2004/symposia/2/1/1128_cookrj.htm|title=Crop Science  - ICSC2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; can lead to the quicker buildup of [[Pest (organism)|pests]] and [[disease]]s, and then rapid spread where a uniform crop is susceptible to a [[pathogen]]. The practice has been criticized for its environmental effects and for putting the food supply chain [[Food security|at risk]]. Diversity can be added both in time, as with a crop rotation or sequence, or in space, with a [[polyculture]].

Oligoculture has been suggested to describe a crop rotation of just a few crops, as is practiced by several regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9777.html|title=Denison, R.: Darwinian Agriculture: How Understanding Evolution Can Improve Agriculture. (eBook and Hardcover)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term monoculture is frequently applied for other uses to describe any group dominated by a single variety, e.g. social [[monoculturalism]], or in the field of musicology to describe the dominance of the American and British music-industries in Western [[pop music]], or in the field of computer science to describe a [[monoculture (computer science)|group of computers]] all running identical software.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Land use==
The term is used in [[agriculture]] and describes the practice of planting the same [[cultivar]] over an extended area. Each cultivar has the same standardized planting, maintenance and harvesting requirements resulting in greater yields and lower costs.  For example, researchers have discovered a native plant to Senegal, called Guiera senegalensis, grown next to millet increased millet production [https://phys.org/news/2018-11-tough-shrub-hunger-africa.html roughly 900 percent].

It also is beneficial because a crop can be tailor-planted for a location that has special problems – like [[soil salinity|soil salt]] or [[drought]] or a short growing season.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

When a crop is matched to its well-managed environment, a monoculture can produce higher yields than a polyculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The functional role of producer diversity in ecosystems|url = http://www.amjbot.org/content/98/3/572|journal = American Journal of Botany|date = 2011-03-01|issn = 0002-9122|pmid = 21613148|pages = 572–592|volume = 98|issue = 3|doi = 10.3732/ajb.1000364|first = Bradley J.|last = Cardinale|first2 = Kristin L.|last2 = Matulich|first3 = David U.|last3 = Hooper|first4 = Jarrett E.|last4 = Byrnes|first5 = Emmett|last5 = Duffy|first6 = Lars|last6 = Gamfeldt|first7 = Patricia|last7 = Balvanera|first8 = Mary I.|last8 = O’Connor|first9 = Andrew|last9 = Gonzalez}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 40 years, modern practices such as monoculture planting and the use of synthesized [[fertilizer]]s have reduced the amount of additional land needed to produce food.&lt;ref name="MillerSpoolman2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=G.

These fertilizers, in turn, disrupt the natural makeup of the soil and contribute further to nutrient depletion. Monocropping also creates the spread of pests and diseases, which have to be treated with yet more chemicals. The effects of monocropping on the environment are severe when pesticides and fertilizers make their way into ground water or become airborne, creating pollution.&lt;ref name=monocrops&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haspel|first1=Tamar|title=Monocrops: They’re a problem, but farmers aren’t the ones who can solve it.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/monocrops-theyre-a-problem-but-farmers-arent-the-ones-who-can-solve-it/2014/05/09/8bfc186e-d6f8-11e3-8a78-8fe50322a72c_story.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=12 January 2016|date=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gardening&gt;[http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant-problems/environmental/monoculture-gardening.htm What Is Monocropping: Disadvantages Of Monoculture In Gardening]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forestry===
In [[forestry]], monoculture refers to the planting of one species of tree.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090217085101/http://www.ag-network-chile.net/Monoculture%20Forestry.htm Monoculture Forestry]&lt;/ref&gt; Monoculture plantings provide greater yields{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} and more efficient harvesting than natural stands of trees. Single-species stands of trees are often the natural way trees grow, but the stands show a diversity in tree sizes, with dead trees mixed with mature and young trees. In forestry, monoculture stands that are planted and harvested as a unit provide limited resources for wildlife that depend on dead trees and openings, since all the trees are the same size; they are most often harvested by [[clearcutting]], which drastically alters the habitat. The mechanical harvesting of trees can compact soils, which can adversely affect understory growth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umich.edu/~nre301/forestry-02.doc&lt;/ref&gt; Single-species planting also causes trees to be more vulnerable when they are infected with a pathogen, or attacked by insects,&lt;ref name=Richardson2000&gt;{{Cite book|last=Richardson|first=Edited by David M.|year=2000|title=Ecology and biogeography of Pinus|pages=371|isbn=978-0-521-78910-3|location=Cambridge, U.K.|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; or affected by adverse environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/forestry.html|title=Forestry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawns and animals===
Examples of monoculture include [[lawn]]s and most fields of wheat or corn. The term is also used where a single breed of farm animal is raised in large-scale [[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s (CAFOs). In the United States, [[The Livestock Conservancy]] was formed to protect nearly 200 endangered livestock breeds from going extinct, largely due to the increased reliance on just a handful of highly specialized breeds.


===Disease===
Crops used in agriculture are usually single strains that have been [[Plant breeding|bred]]{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} for high yield and for [[disease resistance|resistance to certain common diseases]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} Given that all plants in a monoculture are genetically similar, if a disease strikes to which they have no resistance, it can destroy entire populations of crops. [[Polyculture]], the mixing of different crops, reduces the likelihood that one or more of the crops will be resistant to any particular [[pathogen]]. Studies have shown that planting a mixture of crop strains in the same field can combat disease effectively.&lt;ref name=LetterstoNature2000&gt;{{cite journal|last= Zhu|first= Youyong|title= Genetic diversity and disease control in rice|journal= International Weekly Journal of Science|date= June 2000|volume= 406|pages= 718–722|url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6797/abs/406718a0.html|access-date= 2000-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ending monocultures grown under disease conditions by introducing crop diversity has greatly increased yields. In one study in China, the planting of several varieties of [[rice]] in the same field increased yields of non-resistant strains by 89% compared to non-resistant strains grown in monoculture, largely because of a dramatic (94%) decrease in the incidence of disease, making [[pesticide]]s less necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mindfully.org/GE/Rice-Diversity-Yield.htm|title= Genetic Diversity and Disease Control in Rice|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111118044541/http://www.mindfully.org/GE/Rice-Diversity-Yield.htm|archivedate= 18 November 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of | 2009}} the [[wheat leaf rust | wheat leaf-rust]] fungus occasioned a great deal of worry internationally, having already decimated wheat crops in Uganda and Kenya, and having started to make inroads into Asia as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/mar/19/rust-fungus-global-wheat-crops|work= The Guardian|location= London|title= 'Stem rust' fungus threatens global wheat harvest|first= John|last= Vidal|date= 2009-03-19|accessdate= 2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the very genetically similar strains of much of the world's wheat crops following the [[Green Revolution]], the impacts of such diseases threaten agricultural production worldwide.

In Ireland, exclusive use of one variety of potato, the "lumper", led to the [[Great Famine (Ireland) | Great Famine]] of 1845-1849. Lumpers provided inexpensive food to feed the Irish masses. Potatoes were [[vegetative propagation |propagated vegetatively]] with little to no genetic variation. 
When ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' arrived in Ireland from the Americas in 1845, the lumper had no resistance to the disease, leading to the nearly complete failure of the potato crop across Ireland. Had the farmers used multiple varieties of potato, the famine might not have occurred.

Many of today's [[livestock industry|livestock production systems]] rely on just a handful of highly specialized breeds. Focusing heavily on a single trait (output) may come at the expense of other desirable traits - such as [[fecundity | fertility]], resistance to disease, [[vigor (disambiguation) | vigor]], and [[mothering]] instincts. In the early 1990s a few [[Holstein cow|Holstein calves]] were observed to grow poorly and died in the first 6 months of life. They were all found to be [[homozygous]] for a mutation in the gene that caused [[Bovine Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency]]. This mutation was found at a high frequency in Holstein populations worldwide. (15% among bulls in the US, 10% in Germany, and 16% in Japan.) Researchers studying the pedigrees of affected and carrier animals tracked the source of the mutation to a single bull that was widely used in the industry. Note that in 1990 there were approximately 4 million Holstein cattle in the US, making the affected population around 600,000 animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://albc-usa.etapwss.com/index.php/resources/internal/rare-breed-facts|work=The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location= Rome|title= The Value of Genome Mapping for the Genetic Conservation of Cattle|first= J.L.|last= Williams|date= 2015-10-22|accessdate= 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans rely heavily on a relatively small number of food crops and farm animals for food.  If disease hits a major food crop - as happened during the 19th-century Irish potato famine - food supplies for large populations could come under threat.  Maintaining and increasing [[biodiversity]] in agriculture could help safeguard world food-supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/26/sixth-mass-extinction-of-wildlife-also-threatens-global-food-supplies Sixth mass extinction of wildlife also threatens global food supplies] ''[[The Guardian]]''

=== Sociology ===
Monocultural land-use can have effects at the level of [[society]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Polyculture===
{{Main|Polyculture}}
The [[environmental movement]] seeks to change popular culture by redefining the "perfect lawn" to be something other than a turf monoculture, and seeks [[agricultural policy]] that provides greater encouragement for more diverse cropping systems. [[Local food]] systems may also encourage growing multiple species and a wide variety of crops at the same time and same place. [[Heirloom gardening]] and raising heritage livestock breeds have come about largely as a reaction against monocultures in agriculture.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Nijaz Ibrulj''' (born 2 July 1956) is a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and a professor at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Department of Philosophy and Sociology. He lectures on [[logic]], [[analytic philosophy]], methodology of social sciences, theory of knowledge, and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ff.unsa.ba/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;catid=14&amp;Itemid=52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibrulj, Nijaz ''Bosnia Porphyriana. An Outline of the Development of Logic in Bosnia and Herzegovina'' in ''Pregled'', 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His interests also extend to the field of social ontology. In 2000-2001 Ibrulj was awarded a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Visiting Scholarship]] to visit the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]], where he worked with [[John Searle]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zrs-kp.si/EN/zaposleni/bibliografija_in_projekti.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic activities==
Ibrulj is the founder and president of  the [[Academia Analitica]], a [[learned society]] for the development of logic and analytic philosophy in Bosnia and Herzegovina and director of the "ZINK", a scientific and research incubator.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.academia-analitica.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ziink.wordpress.com/clanovi-2/mentori/&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founding editor of ''SOPHOS'', a young researchers’ journal and of ''The Logical Foresight'', a journal for logic and science.

==Work in philosophy==
Ibrulj has written extensively on various topics of analytic philosophy, philosophical logic, and philosophy of language, cognitive science and social ontology.

In his book ''Philosophy of Logic (1999)'', he introduced a theory named the Principle of the Logical. He defines the Principle of the Logical as an ideal matrix of  the logical principles or laws of thought (the law of identity, the law of non-contradiction, the law of excluded middle, the law of sufficient reason).&lt;ref&gt;Ibrulj ''Philosophy of Logic'' (1999), ch. 4, pp. 187-226&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''The Century of Rearrangement'' (2005), Ibrulj investigated the concepts of relation between identity and knowledge in an ambient of intelligent space, which is designed by modern informational and communicational technology, nanoscience and [[nanotechnology]], and the processes of [[globalization|globalisation]]. He made a distinction between two theories of identity: a strong theory of identity (“anchored identity”) and a weak theory of identity (“mobile identity” or “identity in action”).&lt;ref&gt;Ibrulj ''The Century of Rearrangements. Essays on Identity, Knowledge and Society.'' (2005), pp. 17-49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Arnautović| first = Samir| title = Transcendentalna filozofija i odrednice moderne| year = 2009| isbn = 978-9958-9419-2-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibrulj has also translated from [[English language|English]] (Donald Davidson), [[German language|German]] (Gottlob Frege), and [[Ancient Greek]] (Bosnian–Greek edition of [[Porphyry (geology)|Porphyry]]'s [[Isagoge]]).&lt;ref&gt;Premec, Vladimir ''Kulturnoznanstvena vrednota'' in ''Dijalog'', 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern Emberá''', also known as West Embera and '''Cholo''', is the largest [[Embera language]]. It is spoken largely in [[Colombia]], but is also the principal language of the [[Darien Gap]] in [[Panama]].The Emberá language is divided into two branches: Northern and Southern. Two prominent Northern groups are Emberá Darien and Katio. The Katio language is spoken by 10,000 - 20,000 people, who's literacy rate is at 1%. The Darien Emberá language is spoken by 9,000-10,000 people.

== Classification ==
Northern Emberá is a dialect that comes from Embera which is part of the Chocó family. The Chocó family includes two languages, Waunana and the group of the Emberá dialects. The Emberá dialects form a dialectal continuum with two geographically defined subgroups: the Northern branch contains the Proper Northern Emberá (referred to as ‘Northern Emberá’ in Mortensen 1999)&lt;ref name="Mortensen1999"&gt;Mortensen, Charles A. 1999. A Reference Grammar of the Northern Emberá Languages. Dallas: SIL International&lt;/ref&gt; and the Katío dialect.

== History ==
The Waunanas and Emberás are the last remnants of a larger group of Pre-Columbian ethnies, such as the Orominas, the Chancos, the Guarras, the Burrumías, that were diminished during the Colonial period. Genetic findings show that the speakers of Chocó languages are genetically differentiated from the Chibcha speaking tribes of Northern Colombia and cluster with the Orinoquian and Amazonian indigenous populations. Waunana and Emberá share a large number of cognates (estimated to 50% by Loewen 1960: 12), which provide evidence for their common origin. However, there is no clear evidence in terms of a sufficient number of cognates for a common origin of Chocó with other South or Central American families.

== Geographic Distribution ==
The majority of the Katio language are found along the Upper Sinu, San Jorge, San Pedro and Murri Rivers of northwestern Colombia with a few living in Panama. The majority of Darien Embera speakers live in Panama with approximately 2,000 living in northwestern Colombia on the Atrato River.

== Grammar==

=== Phoneme Inventory ===
Katio's phoneme inventory contains 16 consonants (p, t, dɮ , t͡ʃʼ, k, b, d, g, s, h, m, n, r, u) and 6 vowels, both oral and nasal (a, e, i, o, u, ɨ). Darien Embera's phoneme inventory contains 17 consonants (p, t, k, b, d, dɮ, t͡ʃʼ, g, s, h, z, r, t, w, j) and 6 vowels, oral and nasal (a, e, i, o, u, ɨ).

=== Syntax ===
The Chocó languages show the properties of head-final languages: OV order, postpositions, embedded verbs preceding matrix verbs. At the clausal level, the basic order is SOV with some flexibility used for discourse purposes.

==== Noun phrase ====
The neutral order in the noun phrase is: [DP D [QP [AP [NP N] A ] Q ]. Determiners (D) precede the noun (N), while adjectives (A) and quantifiers (Q) are postnominal in the neutral configuration. Determiners include demonstratives, some indexical elements, as well as the definite determiner. The definite article is also used for the nominalization of non-nominal constituents.

==== Verbs ====
Verb clusters are linearized in a head-final pattern. The auxiliary follows the lexical verb, and the matrix verb follows the embedded verb. With non-verbal predicates, the auxiliary follows the predicative element. For example:

Northern Emberá:

''Ẽpẽrã-ra porekea b-ɯ-a.''

person-ABS fat be-PRS-DECL

‘''The man is fat.’''

=== Reduplication ===
Reduplication is very productive and may be total, or partial. It is frequently used for the derivation of adjectives, and verbs. Verbs formed through reduplication have an iterative or durative interpretation. Reduplication is used to lessen the intensity of both verbs and adjectives. 
{| class="wikitable"
|p’ãwãrã ‘blue’ 
|→
|p’ãwã~p’ãwãrã ‘greenish-blue’
|-
|ip’ida ‘(to) laugh’
|→
|ip’ida~ip’ida ‘(to) smile’ 
|-
|pía ‘good’
|→
|pi~ʔia ‘very well’
|}

=== Nasalization ===
In Chocó languages, the nasal feature spreads throughout a nasal morpheme, affecting vowels, sonorants and voiced obstruents. In Northern Emberá, regressive nasalization is reported to appear only with some speakers. The domain of nasalization is blocked by voiceless obstruents as well as by the multiple vibrant /r/.

=== Numbers ===
Number is marked on nouns and verbs. The singular is generally unmarked, while the plural is overtly marked. Within the noun phrase, plural is marked on the head, which is either a noun or a pronoun. Nominal plural is encoded by the morpheme -rã in Emberá. The plural suffix is highly integrated to the verbal inflection such that its form depends on tense; Northern Emberá -ta ‘PL’ in present/habitual and -da ‘PL’ in the past tense.

=== Tense ===
Northern Emberá and Katio make a clear distinction (immediate vs. unspecified temporal distance) in those tenses in which the event time point does not coincide with the speech time point (past and future)For example: Northern Emberá wã-toko-a (go-IMM_PST-DECL) ‘s/he just left’ vs. wã-podo-a (go-IMM_FUT-DECL) ‘s/he is about to leave’

The '''Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti''', "New Academy of Fine Arts", also known as '''NABA''', is a privately run university in [[Milan]], [[Lombardy]], Italy. It has approximately 3000 students,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naba.it/why-choose-naba/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom are from abroad; it participates in the [[Erasmus Programme]].

==History==

NABA was founded in Milan in 1980.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1994 the Nuova Accademia received one of the forty "Ambrogino" certificates of civic merit awarded each year by the [[Comune]] of Milan.&lt;ref name=ambrogio&gt;[http://www.comune.milano.it/dseserver/ambrogini/attach/elenco%20CIVICHE%20BENEMERENZE_storiche.pdf Benemerenze Civiche (elenco aggiornato all'anno 2011)] (in Italian). Accessed May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 NABA also began hosting a “node”, or center linked to the [[University of Plymouth]]’s Planetary-Collegium research platform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/273 Planetary-Collegium]&lt;/ref&gt; offering various PhD programs in the arts and technology.

NABA was bought by Bastogi Spa of Milan in 2002. In December 2009 Bastogi sold it to [[Laureate Education]] of [[Baltimore]], Maryland, for €22 million.&lt;ref name=bastogi&gt;[http://www.bastogi.com/it/storia/ Storia]. Bastogi Spa. (in Italian) "History".

'''Performativity''' is [[language]] which effects change in the world and functions as a form of social action.&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=Jillian R.|title=Performativity|journal=Anthropology|date=10 March 2015|doi=10.1093/OBO/9780199766567-0114|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0114.xml|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has multiple applications in diverse fields, such as [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[jurisprudence|law]], [[gender studies]], [[performance studies]], and [[economics]].

Performativity was first defined by [[philosopher of language]] [[J. L. Austin|John L. Austin]] as the capacity of speech and communication to act or to consummate an action. Common examples of performative language are making promises, betting, performing a wedding ceremony, an umpire calling a strike, or a judge pronouncing a verdict. Austin differentiated this from constative language, which he defined as descriptive language that can be "evaluated as true or false".&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh/&gt;

Influenced by Austin, philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argued that [[social construction of gender|gender is socially constructed]] through commonplace [[speech act]]s and [[nonverbal communication]] that are performative, in that they serve to define and maintain [[social identity|identities]].&lt;ref name="Butler1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of performativity reverses the idea that a person's identity is the source of their secondary actions (speech, gestures). Instead, it views actions, behaviors and gestures as both the result of an individual's identity as well as a source that contributes to the formation of one's identity which is continuously being redefined through speech acts and symbolic communication.&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh/&gt; This view was also influenced by philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Studies and Discourse Analysis – Barker &amp; Galasinski&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===J. L. Austin===

The term derives from the founding work in [[speech act]] theory by ordinary language philosopher [[J. L. Austin]], who did not use the word "performativity", but did, beginning in the 1950s, give the name [[performative utterances]] to situations where saying something was doing something, rather than simply reporting on or describing reality. The paradigmatic case here is speaking the words "I do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=J L|title=How To Do Things With Words|year=1962|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking with [[analytic philosophy]], Austin argued in ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]'' that a "performative utterance" cannot be said to be either true or false, as a constative utterance might be. It can only be judged either "happy" or "infelicitous", depending upon whether the conditions required for its success have been met. In this sense, performativity is a function of the [[pragmatics]] of language. Having shown that ''all'' utterances perform actions, even apparently constative ones, Austin famously discarded the distinction between "performative" and "constative" utterances halfway through the lecture series that became the book and replaced it with a three-level framework:

* ''locution'' (the actual words spoken, that which the linguists and linguistic philosophers of the day were mostly interested in analyzing) 
* ''illocutionary force'' (what the speaker is attempting to do ''in'' uttering the locution) 
* ''perlocutionary effect'' (the actual effect the speaker actually has on the interlocutor ''by'' uttering the locution)

For example, if a speech act is an attempt to distract someone, the illocutionary force is the attempt to distract and the perlocutionary effect is the actual distraction caused by the speech act in the interlocutor.

Austin's account of performativity has been subject to extensive discussion in philosophy, literature, and beyond. [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Judith Butler]], and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] are among the scholars who have elaborated upon and contested aspects of Austin's account from the vantage point of [[deconstruction]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[feminism]], and [[queer theory]]. Particularly in the work of feminists and queer theorists, performativity has played an important role in discussions of [[social change]] (Oliver 2003).

The concept of performativity has also been used in [[science and technology studies]] and in [[economic sociology]]. [[Andrew Pickering]] has proposed to shift from a "representational idiom" to a "performative idiom" in the study of science. [[Michel Callon]] has proposed to study the performative aspects of [[economics]], i.e. the extent to which economic science plays an important role not only in describing markets and economies, but also in framing them. Karen Barad has argued that science and technology studies deemphasize the performativity of language in order to explore the performativity of matter (Barad 2003).

Other uses of the notion of performativity in the social sciences include the daily behavior (or performance) of individuals based on social norms or habits. Philosopher and feminist theorist [[Judith Butler]] has used the concept of performativity in her analysis of [[gender]] development, as well as in her analysis of political speech. [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] describes [[Queer theory|queer]] performativity as an ongoing project for transforming the way we may define—and break—boundaries to identity. Through her suggestion that shame is a potentially performative and transformational emotion, Sedgwick has also linked queer performativity to [[affect theory]]. Also innovative in Sedgwick's discussion of the performative is what she calls ''periperformativity'' (2003: 67–91), which is effectively the group contribution to the success or failure of a speech act.

===John Searle's reformulation===
In ''[[A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts]]'', [[John Searle]] takes up and reformulates the ideas of his colleague [[J. L. Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Searle largely supports and agrees with Austin’s theory of speech acts, he has a number of critiques, which he outlines: “In sum, there are (at least) six related difficulties with Austin’s taxonomy; in ascending order of importance: there is a persistent confusion between verbs and acts, not all the verbs are illocutionary verbs, there is too much overlap of the categories, too much heterogeneity within the categories, many of the verbs listed in the categories don't satisfy the definition given for the category and, most important, there is no consistent principle of classification.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last key departure from Austin lies in Searle’s claim that four of his universal ‘acts’ do not need ‘extra-linguistic’ contexts to succeed.&lt;ref name="John1979"&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to Austin who thinks all illocutionary acts need extra-linguistic institutions, Searle disregards the necessity of context and replaces it with the “rules of language.”&lt;ref name="John1979" /&gt;

=== Jacques Derrida ===
Philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] drew on Austin's theory of performative speech act while deconstructing its logocentric and phonocentric premises and reinscribing it within the operations of generalized writing. In contrast to structuralism's focus on linguistic form, Austin had introduced the ''force'' of speech acts, which Derrida aligns with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] insights on language. 

In "Signature, Event, Context," Derrida focused on Austin's privileging of speech and the accompanying presumptions of the presence of a speaker ("signature") and the bounding of a performative's force by an act or a context. In a passage that would become a touchstone of poststructuralist thought, Derrida stresses the citationality or iterability of any and all signs.&lt;blockquote&gt;Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be ''cited'', put between quotation marks; in doing so it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. This does not imply that the mark is valid outside of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center or absolute anchorage [''ancrage'']. This citationality, this duplication or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is neither an accident nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could not even have a function called "normal." What would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins would not get lost along the way?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Limited, Inc.|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0810107885|location=Evanston|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Derrida's stress on the citational dimension of performativity would be taken up by Judith Butler and other theorists. While he addressed the performativity of individual subject formation, Derrida also raised such questions as whether we can mark when the event of the Russian revolution went awry, thus scaling up the field of performativity to historical dimensions. 

=== Judith Butler ===
{{Main|Gender performativity}}

Philosopher and [[feminist]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] offered a new, more [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] (specifically, [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]]) reading of the notion of performativity, which has its roots in [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]]. She describes performativity as “that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bodies that Matter:  On the Discursive Limits of "Sex"|last = Butler|first = Judith|publisher = Routledge|year = 1993|isbn = 9780415903660|location = New York|pages = xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has largely used this concept in her analysis of [[gender]] development.&lt;ref&gt;This idea was first introduced in 1988 in an issue of ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' (Brickell, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept places emphasis on the manners by which identity is passed or brought to life through discourse.  Performative acts are types of authoritative speech. This can only happen and be enforced through the law or norms of the society. These statements, just by speaking them, carry out a certain action and exhibit a certain level of power. Examples of these types of statements are declarations of ownership, baptisms, inaugurations, and legal sentences. Something that is key to performativity is repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statements are not singular in nature or use and must be used consistently in order to exert power (Hall 2000).

==== Performance theory and gender perspectives ====

Butler sees gender as an act that has been rehearsed, much like a script, and that people, as actors who make a script a reality through repetition, come to perform in the mode of belief. “For Butler, the distinction between the personal and the political or between private and public is itself a fiction designed to support an oppressive status quo: our most personal acts are, in fact, continually being scripted by hegemonic social conventions and ideologies” (Felluga, 2006).  Butler sees gender not as an expression of what one is, rather as something that one does.  Furthermore, she sees it not as a social imposition on a gender neutral body, but rather as a mode of "self-making" through which subjects become socially intelligible.  According to Butler’s theory, homosexuality and heterosexuality are not fixed categories.  A person is merely in a condition of “doing straightness” or “doing queerness” (Lloyd, 1999).

==== Theoretical criticisms ====

There are several criticisms that have been raised against Butler's concept of performativity.  The first is that the theory is individual in nature and does not take other factors into consideration.  These factors include the space within which the performance occurs, the others involved and how they might see or interpret what they witness.  Also, the unplanned effects of the performance act are overlooked and the contingencies are not taken into consideration. (Lloyd, 1999)

Another criticism is that Butler is not clear about the concept of subject.  It has been said that in her writings, sometimes the subject only exists tentatively, sometimes they possess a “real” existence and other times are socially active.  Also, some observe that the theory might be better suited to literary analysis as opposed to social theory. (Brickell, 2005)

Others criticize Butler for taking [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] and [[Symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] sociological analyses of gender and merely reinventing them in the concept of performativity (Dunn 1997; Green 2007).  For example, Green (2007) argues that the work of [[Sue Kessler|Kessler]] and [[Wendy McKenna|McKenna]] (1978) and West and Zimmerman (1987) builds directly from [[Harold Garfinkel|Garfinkel]] (1967) and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1959) to deconstruct gender into moments of attribution and iteration in a continual social process of "doing" [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] in the [[performative interval]].  These latter works are premised on the notion that gender does not precede but, rather, follows from practice, instantiated in micro-interaction. Butler downgrades gender's constructed nature to fight for oppressed identities.

=== Jean-François Lyotard ===
In ''[[The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]]'' (1979, English translation 1986), philosopher and cultural theorist [[Jean-François Lyotard]] defined performativity as the defining mode of [[legitimation]] of postmodern knowledge and social bonds, that is, power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge.|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-Francois|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0816611737|location=Minneapolis|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the legitimation of modern knowledge through such grand narratives as Progress, Revolution, and Liberation, performativity operates by system optimization or the calculation of input and outputs. In a footnote, Lyotard aligns performativity with Austin's concept of performative speech act. Postmodern knowledge must not only report: it must do something and do it efficiently by maximizing input/output ratios.

Lyotard uses [[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Wittgenstein's]] notion of language games to theorize how performativity governs the articulation, funding, and conduct of contemporary research and education, arguing that at bottom it involves the threat of terror: "be operational (that is commensurable) or disappear" (xxiv). While Lyotard is highly critical of performativity, he notes that it calls on researchers to explain not only the worth of their work but also the worth of that worth. 

Lyotard associated performativity with the rise of digital computers in the post-World War II period. In ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945,'' historian [[Tony Judt]] cites Lyotard to argue that the Left has largely abandoned revolutionary politics for human rights advocacy. The widespread adoption of performance reviews, organizational assessments, and learning outcomes by different social institutions worldwide has led social researchers to theorize "audit culture" and "global performativity." 

Against performativity and [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]]' call for consensus, Lyotard argued for legitimation by ''paralogy'', or the destabilizing, often paradoxical, introduction of difference into language games.

==Other applications==

===Video art===

Theories of performativity have extended across multiple disciplines and discussions. Notably, interdisciplinary theorist [[José Esteban Muñoz]] has related video to theories of performativity. Specifically, Muñoz looks at the 1996 documentary by Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio, "The Transformation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics|author = Muñoz|authorlink = José Esteban Muñoz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historically and theoretically related to performance art, [[video art]] is not an immediate performance; it is mediated, iterative and citational. In this way, video art raises questions of performativity. Additionally, video art frequently puts bodies and display, complicating borders, surfaces, embodiment, and boundaries and so indexing performativity.

=== Finance and economics ===
In economics, the “performativity thesis” is the claim that the assumptions and models used by professionals and popularizers affect the phenomena they purport to describe; bringing the world more into line with theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/performativity.pdf|title = The Performativity of Networks|last = Healy|first = Kieran|date = 2015|journal = European Journal of Sociology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doing"&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing Economics|date=2010|publisher=The Open University|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=978 1 8487 34692|page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is debated in ''Do Economists Make Markets'' edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie]], Fabian Muniesa and Lucia Siu, and in ''Enacting Dismal Science'' edited by Ivan Boldyrev and Ekaterina Svetlova. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8442.html | title=Do Economists Make Markets?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9781137492104# | title=Enacting Dismal Science - New Perspectives on the Performativity of Economics &amp;#124; Ivan Boldyrev &amp;#124; Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journalism ===

The German news anchorman [[Hanns Joachim Friedrichs]] once argued that a good journalist should never act in collusion with anything, not even with a good thing. In the evening of November 9, 1989, the evening of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], however, Friedrichs reportedly broke his own rule when he announced: "The gates of the wall are wide open." („Die Tore in der Mauer stehen weit offen.“) In reality, the gates were still closed. According to a historian, it was this announcement that encouraged thousands of East Berliners to march towards the wall, finally forcing the border guards to open the gates. In the sense of performativity, Friedrichs's words became a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/mauerfall/der-schoenste-fehler-in-40-jahren-tagesthemen-54357108.bild.html | title=Zum Jubiläum - der schönste Fehler in 40 Jahren "Tagesthemen"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846.html | title=Mary Elise Sarotte -- How an accident caused the Berlin Wall to come down| date=November 2009| last1=Sarotte| first1=Mary Elise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Private cancellations''' are [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellation]]s of [[postage stamp]]s, or in some cases, artist stamps applied by other than a government or other official stamp-issuing entity.

==In the United States==
Private postmarks are commonly used with private postal meters. They are also occasionally used to create "first day of issue" items for personalized U.S. postage (officially defined as meter labels and thus not requiring cancellation).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929062844/http://www.cart.c3cachets.com/product_info.php?cPath=107&amp;products_id=1433&amp;osCsid=55ac85c6f5d2c48710b78372fb97a00b]&lt;/ref&gt; Private cancellations are often applied by local posts to their stamps (this is frequently also the first day of issue).  

Another type of private cancellation, used in the [[United States]], is the [[Mailer's Postmark Permit]], by which license-holders can cancel their own mail under certain conditions.  They can in the U.S. be applied to [[mail]] carried outside the post by authority of the [[private express statutes]].  An example of this is the [[Torch Lake Township, Houghton County, Michigan|Chickensville, Michigan]] private cancellation, applied to mail carried, although Chickensville does not have a post office.

Private postmarks have also been used as back-stamps showing the name of the firm from which the mail was sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdncovers.com/763usfancy.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724052410/http://www.cdncovers.com/763usfancy.jpg |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States taxation===
In the United States if the time of posting is significant and there is both a private and regular cancellation, the regular cancellation controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=CCH Incorporated|first=CHH Tax Law Editors|title=Federal Tax Compliance Manual|pages=9804 |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/lanoa/pmta01576_7400.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private postmarks are not considered valid in some other cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oah.dc.gov/oah/frames.asp?doc=/oah/lib/oah/pdf/information/ui_faqs.pdf UI FAQs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609045016/http://oah.dc.gov/oah/frames.asp?doc=%2Foah%2Flib%2Foah%2Fpdf%2Finformation%2Fui_faqs.pdf |date=2009-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pedro''', or '''Pêro da Covilhã''' or  ({{IPA-pt|ˈpeɾu dɐ kuviˈʎɐ̃}}; c. 1460 &amp;ndash; after 1526), sometimes written: Pero de Covilhăo, was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[diplomat]] and [[explorer]].

He was a native of [[Covilhã]] in [[Beira, Portugal|Beira]]. In his early life he had gone to [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and entered the service of Don Juan de Guzmán, brother of [[Enrique de Guzmán, 2nd Duke of Medina Sidonia]]. Later, when [[War of the Castilian Succession|war broke out]] between Castile and Portugal, he returned to his own country, and attached himself, first as a groom, then as a squire, to [[Afonso V of Portugal]] and his successor [[John II of Portugal]].  In 1487, his overland expedition made its way to India, exploring trade opportunities with the Indians and Arabs, and winding up finally in Ethiopia. His detailed report was eagerly read in Lisbon, as Portugal became the world's  best informed center for global geography and trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Stavrianos, ''The World since 1500: a Global history'' (1966) pp 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;

King John II put him in charge of diverse private missions, and finally, to use his knowledge of different languages, ordered him and [[Afonso de Paiva]] to undertake a mission of exploration in the Near East and the adjoining regions of Asia and Africa, with the special assignment to learn where [[cinnamon]] and other spices could be found, as well as of discovering the land of legendary [[Prester John]], by overland routes.&lt;ref name="Newitt2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malyn Newitt|title=A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HDODAgAAQBAJ|date=5 November 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-55304-4|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Bruce, ''Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile'' (1805 edition), vol. 3, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bartolomeu Dias]], at the same time, went out to by sea find the Prester's country, as well as the termination of the African continent and the ocean route to [[India]].

The expedition started at [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]], on 7 May 1487. Covilhã and Paiva were provided with a letter of credence for all the countries of the world and with a map for navigating, taken from the map of the world and compiled by Bishop Diogo, and doctors Rodrigo and Moisés. The first two of these were prominent members of the commission which advised the Portuguese government to reject the proposals of [[Christopher Columbus]].  The explorers started from [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] and travelled by [[Barcelona]] to [[Naples]], where their bills of exchange were paid by the sons of [[Cosimo de' Medici]]; from there they went to [[Rhodes]], where they stayed with two other Portuguese, and so to [[Alexandria]] and [[Cairo]], where they posed as merchants.

In company with Arabs from [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and [[Tlemcen]], they now went by way of [[El-Tor]] to [[Suakin]] and [[Aden]], where, as it was now the [[monsoon]], they parted. Covilhã proceeded to India and Paiva to [[Ethiopia]]. They agreed to meet again in Cairo. Covilhã thus arrived at [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]], from where he retraced his steps to [[Goa]] and [[Ormus|Hormuz]], the [[Red Sea]] and Cairo, making an excursion on his way down the East African coast to [[Sofala]].

At Cairo he heard of Paiva's death, and met with two Portuguese Jews: Rabbi [[Abraham of Beja]], and [[José Sapateiro]], a shoe-maker of [[Lamego]] who had been sent by King John with letters for Covilhã and Paiva. By Joseph of Lamego, Covilhã replied with an account of his Indian and African journeys, and of his observations on the [[cinnamon]], [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[clove]] trade at Calicut, together with advice as to the ocean way to India. He recommended that the Portuguese should sail south along the coast of Africa and the seas of Guinea. The first objective in the eastern ocean, he added, was Madagascar; from this island one could reach Calicut.

==Ethiopia==
With this information Joseph returned to Portugal, while Covilhã, with [[Abraham of Beja]], again visited [[Aden]] and Hormuz. At the latter he left the rabbi; and himself came back to [[Jeddah]], the port of the Arabian holy land, and penetrated (as he told [[Francisco Álvares]] many years later) even to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. Finally, by [[Mount Sinai]], [[El-Tor]] and the [[Red Sea]], he reached [[Zeila]], whence he struck inland to the court of Prester John ([[Ethiopia]]).

Here he was honorably received by the [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Eskender]]; lands and lordships were bestowed upon him, but Eskander refused to grant him permission to leave, and his successors evaded granting Covilhã permission. According to [[James Bruce]], Covilhã maintained a correspondence with the king in Portugal, describing Ethiopia as "very populous, full of cities both powerful and rich".&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, ''Travels'', vol. 3, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1507, he was joined by João Gomes, a priest sent by [[Tristão da Cunha]], who had reached Ethiopia by way of [[Socotra]]. When the Portuguese embassy under [[Rodrigo de Lima]], which included [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Ethiopian ambassador Mateus]] and missionary [[Francisco Álvares]], entered Ethiopia in 1520, Covilhã wept with joy at the sight of his fellow-countrymen. It was then forty years since he had left Portugal, and over thirty since he had been a prisoner of state in Ethiopia. Álvares, who professed to know him well, and to have heard the story of his life, both in confession and out of it, praises his power of vivid description as if things were present before him, and his extraordinary knowledge of all the spoken languages of Christians, Muslims and Gentiles. His services as an interpreter were valuable to Rodrigo de Lima's embassy. 
Covilhã was well treated, but was not allowed to leave the country until his death.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

'''Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins''' (born ''Thocmentony'', meaning "[[Chelone (genus)|Shell Flower]]; also seen as "Tocmetone" in [[Northern Paiute language|Northern Paiute]];&lt;ref&gt;Canfield 1988, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; {{circa|1844}} – October 16, 1891) was a [[Northern Paiute]] author, activist and educator.

Reno was born near [[Humboldt Lake]], [[Nevada]], into an influential Paiute family who led their community in pursuing friendly relations with the arriving groups of Anglo-American settlers. She was sent to study in a Catholic school in [[Santa Clara, California]]. When the [[Paiute War]] erupted between the Pyramid Lake Paiute and the settlers, including some who were friends of the Winnemucca family, Sarah and some of her family traveled to [[San Francisco]] and [[Virginia City]] to escape the fighting. They made a living performing onstage as "A Paiute Royal Family." In 1865, while the Winnemucca family was away, their [[Band (anthropology)|band]] was attacked by the US cavalry, who killed 29 Paiutes, including Sarah's mother and several members of her extended family.

Subsequently, Winnemucca became an advocate for the [[rights of Native Americans]], traveling across the US to tell Anglo-Americans about the plight of her people. When the Paiute were interned in a concentration camp at [[Yakima, Washington]] after the [[Bannock War]], she traveled to Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress and the executive branch for their release. She also served US forces as a messenger, interpreter, and guide, and as a teacher for imprisoned Native Americans.

Winnemucca published ''[[Life Among the Paiutes: Their Wrongs and Claims]]'' (1883), a book that is both a memoir and history of her people during their first 40 years of contact with European Americans. It is considered the "first known autobiography written by a Native American woman."&lt;ref name="MN"&gt;[http://voices.cla.umn.edu/artistpages/hopkinsSarah.php ''Voices from the Gaps'': "Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins"], [[University of Minnesota Twin Cities|University of Minnesota]] website, accessed 11 February 204&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Omer Stewart described it as "one of the first and one of the most enduring [[Ethnohistory|ethnohistorical]] books written by an American Indian," frequently cited by scholars.&lt;ref name="omer"&gt;[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1vx9q7p0#page-1 Omer Stewart, Review: "Gae Whitney Canfield, 'Sarah Winnemucca of the Northern Paiutes', Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma, 1983"], ''Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology,'' 5(2), 1983, accessed 12 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of the book, Winnemucca toured the Eastern United States, giving lectures about her people in New England, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. She returned to the West, founding a private school for Native American children in [[Lovelock, Nevada]].

Since the late 20th century, scholars have paid renewed attention to Winnemucca for her contributions. In 1993, she was inducted posthumously into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nevada Writers Hall of Fame: Sarah Winnemucca|url=http://guides.library.unr.edu/nvwriters-hall-of-fame/winnemucca-1993|website=University of Nevada, Reno|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the state of Nevada contributed a [[Sarah Winnemucca (Victor)|statue of her]] by sculptor [[Benjamin Victor (sculptor)|Benjamin Victor]] to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] in the [[U.S. Capitol]].

Winnemucca's legacy has been controversial. Some biographers have wished to remember her primarily for her activism and social work to better the conditions for her people, while others have criticized her for her tendency to exaggerate her social status among the Paiute. Among the Paiute, her assistance to the US military at a time when they were at war with the Paiute has been criticized, as has her advocacy for [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilation of Natives]] to Anglo-American culture. But the Paiute have also recognized her social work and activism for indigenous rights.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Catherine. 1994. "Foreword" in Sarah Winnemucca, ''Life Among the Paiutes: Their Wrongs and Claims'', University of Nebraska Press, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born "somewhere near 1844" at [[Humboldt Lake]] in what is now western [[Nevada]], Sarah Winnemucca was the daughter of [[Winnemucca (Paiute leader)|Winnemucca]] (''Poito''), a [[Shoshone]] who had joined the Paiute through marriage,&lt;ref name="omer"/&gt; and his wife ''Tuboitonie''. Sarah had an older sister Mary,&lt;ref&gt;[//books.google.com/books?id=Pk1Q77UXQQ0C&amp;pg=PA47 Gae Whitney Canfield, ''Sarah Winnemucca of the Northern Paiutes''], University of Oklahoma Press, 1988, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; younger brother Natchez,&lt;ref name="omer"/&gt; and sister Elma.&lt;ref name="Canfield 1988 p. 49"&gt;Canfield (1988), ''Sarah Winnemucca'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; (Although Sarah later said that her father was chief of all of the Northern [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]], the Paiute had no such centralized leadership. Her father, though influential, was the war chief of a small band of about 150 people.&lt;ref name="Canfield 1988 p. 94"&gt;Canfield (1988), ''Sarah Winnemucca'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Senier, S.

"Exploitation of ethos: Sarah Winnemucca and Bright Eyes on the lecture tour," ''Western Journal of Speech Communication'', 41(4), 233–244.&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Winnemucca, Nevada]] was named after her father.

Sarah's grandfather, ''Tru-ki-zo'' or ''[[Truckee (chief)|Truckee]]'' (meaning "good" in the Paiute language, or derived from ''Tro-kay'', which means "hello" ), had established positive relations with the European Americans who started exploring in the area. He guided Captain [[John C. Frémont]] during his 1843–45 survey and map-making expedition across the [[Great Basin]] to California. Later, Truckee fought in the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848), earning many white friends and leading the way for his extended family's relationships with European Americans.

At the age of six, Sarah traveled with her family to near [[Stockton, California]], where the adults worked in the cattle industry. In 1857, their grandfather arranged for Sarah (then 13) and her sister Elma to live and work in the household of [[William Ormsby]] and his wife; he had a hotel and was a civic leader of [[Carson City, Nevada]]. The couple wanted a companion for their daughter, Lizzie. The Winnemucca girls also did domestic work in the house. They had a chance to improve their English and learn more about European-American ways.&lt;ref&gt;Canfield (1983), ''Sarah Winnemucca'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah particularly began to be at ease in going back and forth between Paiute and European-American culture. She was one of the few Paiute in Nevada who knew how to read and write English, and her family all spoke English.&lt;ref name="omer" /&gt;

==Pyramid Lake War and stage==
[[File:Numaga.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Numaga, or "Young Winnemucca", Sarah Winnemucca's cousin and war leader of the Paiute in the Pyramid Lake War.]]
With the decreasing pressure of new migrants in the region attracted to the Washoe silver finds, Old Winnemucca arranged in 1859 to have his daughters returned to him again in Nevada. In 1860, open conflict occurred. The Paiute had killed two men who had kidnapped and abused two Paiute girls. Settlers and miners organized a militia, making Major Ormsby lead it by default. He was killed by the Paiute in a disciplined confrontation in the first event of the [[Pyramid Lake War]]. Settlers were alarmed at how well the Paiute fought and the ill-prepared miners could not hold their own.&lt;ref&gt;Canfield (1983), ''Sarah Winnemucca'', pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; The Paiute and whites reached a truce by the end of the summer. Young Winnemucca, Sarah's cousin, led the Paiute as a war chief by then. In October 1860, their grandfather Truckee died of a [[tarantula]] bite.

As a mark of development, Nevada was established as a distinct US Territory, and [[James W. Nye]] was appointed as its first governor. When he came to the territory, he went to the Pyramid Lake Reservation, where he met Old Winnemucca, Young Winnemucca and the Paiute, who put on a grand display.&lt;ref&gt;Canfield (1988), ''Sarah Winnemucca'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; For the next five years (1860–1865), Sarah and her family frequently traveled away from the reservation, performing on stage, either in [[Virginia City, Nevada]] at Maguire's Opera House, or in [[San Francisco]]. They were billed as the "Paiute Royal Family."&lt;ref name="omer" /&gt; By this time, her father had taken a second, younger wife, with whom he had a young son.

In Nevada, US forces repeatedly acted against Native Americans to "remind them of who was in charge." The Natives were repeatedly accused of raids and cattle stealing.&lt;ref name="omer" /&gt; In 1865 Captain Almond B. Wells led a Nevada Volunteer cavalry in indiscriminate raids across the northern part of the state, attacking Paiute bands. While Sarah and her father were in [[Dayton, Nevada]], Wells and his men attacked Old Winnemucca's camp, killing 29 of the 30 persons in the band, who were old men, women and children.&lt;ref name="omer" /&gt;

The chief's two wives (including Sarah's mother) and infant son were killed.&lt;ref name="omer" /&gt; Although Sarah's sister Mary escaped from camp, she died later that winter due to the severe conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Canfield (1988), ''Sarah Winnemucca'', pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; Her younger sister Elma was out of the area, as she had been adopted by a French family in [[Marysville, California]]. There Elma Winnemucca married John Smith, a white man, and moved with him to a white community in Montana and, later, Idaho.&lt;ref name="Canfield 1988 p. 49" /&gt;

In 1868 about 490 Paiute survivors moved to a military camp, which became known as [[Fort McDermitt]], on the Nevada–Oregon border. They sought protection from the US Army against the Nevada Volunteers. In 1872 the federal government established the [[Malheur Reservation]] in eastern Oregon, designated by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] for the Northern Paiute and [[Bannock (tribe)|Bannock]] peoples in the area. Three bands of Paiute moved there at the time. In 1875, Sarah, her brother Natchez and his family, and their father Old Winnemucca moved there, too.&lt;ref name="Canfield 1988 p. 92"&gt;Canfield (1988), ''Sarah Winnemucca'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching and interpreter==
Winnemucca was invited to work as the interpreter at the Malheur Reservation by [[Indian Agent]] [[Samuel B. Parrish]]. She found in observing Parrish that he worked well with the Paiute; he encouraged them in learning some new ways and helped them plant crops that could support the people, establishing a well-managed agricultural program. He had a school built at the reservation, and Sarah became an assistant teacher.&lt;ref name="Canfield 94-99"&gt;Canfield (1988), ''Sarah Winnemucca'', pp. 94-99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Sarah married Edward Bartlett, a former First Lieutenant in the Army, on 29 January 1872 at [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zanjani |first1=Sally |title=Sarah Winnemucca |location=Reno NV |publisher=University of Nevada Press |year=2001 |page=109 |isbn=0-8032-4917-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He abandoned her, and she returned to Camp McDermitt. In 1876, after having moved to Malheur Reservation, she got a divorce and filed to take back her name of Winnemucca, which the court granted.&lt;ref name="Canfield 109-110"&gt;Canfield (1988), ''Sarah Winnemucca'', pp. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bannock War==
After four years, Parrish was replaced in the summer of 1876 by agent [[William V. Rinehart]]. The Paiute were sorry to see Parrish leave.

A proponent of extermination-style warfare, Rinehart emphasized keeping the Paiute under his thumb. He reversed many of the policies that Parrish had initiated, telling the Paiute the reservation land belonged to the government. He failed to pay their workers for agricultural labor in communal fields, and alienated many tribal leaders. Conditions at the [[Malheur Reservation]] quickly became intolerable.

In her 1883 book, Winnemucca recounted that Rinehart sold supplies intended for the Paiute people to local whites. Much of the good land on the reservation was illegally expropriated by white settlers. In 1878, virtually all of the Paiute and [[Bannock people]] left the reservation because of these abuses and their difficulties in living. The Bannock from southern Idaho had left the [[Fort Hall Reservation]] due to similar problems. They moved west, raiding isolated white settlements in southern [[Oregon]] and northern Nevada, triggering the [[Bannock War]] (1878). The degree to which Northern Paiute people participated with the Bannock is unclear. Winnemucca wrote that she and several other Paiute families were held hostage by the Bannock during the war.

During the Bannock War, Winnemucca worked as a translator for General [[Oliver O. Howard]] of the [[U.S. Army]], whom she had met during his visit to the reservation; she also acted as a scout and messenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard|first=Major-General O. O.|title=Toc-Me-To-Ne, An Indian Princess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxQbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA820-|year=1908|publisher=St. Nicholas magazine, Scribner &amp; Company|pages=820–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her account, the Bannock warriors and the Army soldiers liked each other so much that they rarely shot to kill. For whatever reason, casualties were relatively few. Winnemucca was highly regarded by the officers she worked for, and she included letters of recommendation from several of them in her 1883 book. Impressed by many of the officers, Winnemucca began to support the US Army's position to have the military take over administration of the [[Indian reservations]], rather than political appointees. (Note: After the 1870 [[Marias Massacre]] by US Army forces in Montana, President Grant had promoted a peace policy, appointing Quaker leaders as Indian agents to reservations and intending to eradicate problems of corruption that way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Utley, Robert M. |title=Frontier Regulars the United States Army and the Indian, 1866–1891|publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |pages=191–192 |year=1973 |isbn=0-8032-9551-0|chapter=Grant's Peace Policy, 1869-74}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Move to Yakama Reservation==
[[Image:Sarahwin.jpg|thumb|Sarah Winnemucca, performing as "Princess Winnemucca", daughter of Chief Winnemucca]]
Following the Bannock War, the Northern Paiute bands were ordered from Nevada to the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]] (in eastern [[Washington Territory]]), where they endured great deprivation. A total of 543 Paiute were interned in what has been described as a "concentration camp."&lt;ref name="omer"/&gt;

Winnemucca accompanied them to serve as a translator. Since she had an official job, she was not required to live on a reservation. Outraged by the harsh conditions forced on the Paiute, she began to lecture across [[California]] and [[Nevada]] on the plight of her people. During the winter of 1879 and 1880, she, her father, and two other Winnemucca visited Washington, DC to lobby for release of the Paiute from the Yakama Reservation.&lt;ref name="omer"/&gt; They gained permission from [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], [[Carl Schurz]], for the Paiute to be allowed to return to Malheur, at their own expense. Instead, the government decided to "discontinue" the Malheur Reservation in 1879, closing it.

"Knowing the temper of the people through whom they must pass, still smarting from the barbarities of the war two years previous, and that the Paiutes, utterly destitute of everything, must subsist themselves on their route by pillage, I refused permission for them to depart . . . and soon after, on being more correctly informed of the state of affairs, the Hon. Secretary revoked his permission though no determination as to their permanent location was arrived at. This was a great disappointment to the Paiutes and the greatest caution and care was necessary in dealing with them."

==Second marriage==
In 1881 General [[Oliver O. Howard]] hired Sarah Winnemucca to teach Shoshone prisoners held at [[Vancouver Barracks]]. While there, she met and became close to Lieutenant Lewis H. Hopkins, an Indian Department employee. They married that year in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="omer"/&gt;

==Lectures and writing==
[[Image:Sarah-winnemucca.jpg|thumb]]
In 1883, the Hopkinses traveled east, where Sarah delivered nearly 300 lectures throughout major cities of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, seeking to heighten awareness of injustice against Native Americans. The press reported her talks and often referred to her as the "Paiute [[Indian princess|Princess]]."

In [[Boston]], she met the sisters [[Elizabeth Peabody]] and [[Mary Peabody Mann]], married to the educator [[Horace Mann]]; they began to promote her speaking career. In addition, the two women helped her to compile and prepare her lecture materials for publication as ''Life Among the Piutes''. Her book was published in 1883, the "first known autobiography written by a Native American woman"&lt;ref name="MN"/&gt; and the first U.S. [[copyright registration]] secured by a Native American woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maloney |first1=Wendi |title=Native American Heritage Month: Celebrating Sarah Winnemucca |url=https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2017/11/native-american-heritage-month-celebrating-sarah-winnemucca |website=Library of Congress Blog |accessdate=December 20, 2017 |date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah's husband had contributed to his wife's efforts by gathering material for the book at the [[Library of Congress]]. But he was suffering from [[tuberculosis]], and Winnemucca learned that he was addicted to gambling; her earnings were eaten up by his needs.

After returning to Nevada in 1884, Winnemucca spent a year lecturing in San Francisco. When she returned again to Pyramid Lake, she and her brother built a school for Indian children at [[Lovelock, Nevada]], in order to promote the Paiute culture and language. The Peabody Indian School, named for their benefactor [[Mary Peabody Mann]] in Boston, operated for a couple of years.&lt;ref name="Canfield 232"&gt;Canfield (1988), ''Sarah Winnemucca'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in federal policy following what was considered the success of the [[Carlisle Indian School]] promoted the federal government to promote education for Native American children at English-language boarding schools. Winnemucca's school was closed in 1887 and the children transferred to a facility in [[Grand Junction, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="omer"/&gt; Despite a bequest from Mary Peabody Mann and efforts to turn the school into a technical training center, Winnemucca was struggling financially by the time of her husband's death in 1887.

The [[Dawes Severalty Act]] of 1887 required allotment of communal lands on reservations to individual households to force assimilation of tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Washburn|first1=Kathleen|title=Dawes Severalty Act|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199827251/obo-9780199827251-0149.xml|website=Oxford Bibliographies|accessdate=19 January 2018|ref=ox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winnemucca spent the last four years of her life retired from public activity. She died of tuberculosis at her sister, Elma Smith's home at [[Henry's Lake]], [[Idaho]].&lt;ref name="omer"/&gt;

'''Sediment''' is the solid material that settles to the bottom of any wine container, such as a bottle, vat, tank, cask, or barrel. Sediment is a highly heterogeneous mixture which at the start of wine-making consists of primarily dead yeast cells ([[Lees (fermentation)]]) the insoluble fragments of grape pulp and skin, and the seeds that settle out of new wine. At subsequent stages, it consists of [[Tartrate]]s, and from red wines [[Phenolic content in wine|Phenolic polymers]] as well as any insoluble material added to assist [[Clarification and stabilization of wine|clarification]].

Sediments in bottled wines are relatively rare{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, and usually signal a fine wine that has already spent some years in the bottle{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. So unaccustomed have modern consumers become{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} that many (erroneously) view it as a fault.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Many winemakers therefore take great pains to ensure that the great majority of wines made today (especially those designed to be drunk within their first few years) will remain free of sediment for this time.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Wines designed for long bottle aging, on the other hand, frequently deposit crystals of tartrates, and in addition red wines deposit some pigmented [[Phenolic content in wine#Tannins|tannins]]. Winemakers deliberately leave more tartrates and phenolics in wines designed for long aging in bottle so that they are able to develop the aromatic compounds that constitute bouquet.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Jancis|title=The Oxford Companion To Wine|year=2006|publisher=The Oxford University Press|isbn=0198609906|pages=619|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Oxford-Companion-Wine-Edition/dp/0198609906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susan A. Gelman''' (born July 24, 1957) is currently Heinz Werner Distinguished University Professor of [[psychology]] and [[linguistics]] and the director of the Conceptual Development Laboratory at the [[University of Michigan]]. Her research focuses on [[cognitive development]], [[language acquisition]], [[categorization]], [[inductive reasoning]], [[causal reasoning]], and the relationship between language and thought. Gelman subscribes to the [[domain specificity]] view of [[cognition]], which asserts that the mind is composed of specialized [[modules]] supervising specific functions in the human and other animals.

Gelman was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 2008 and the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2012. She was also formerly President of the Cognitive Development Society (2005-2007). She is currently Chair of the Governing Board of the [[Cognitive Science Society]] and President-Elect of the [[Society for Philosophy and Psychology]].

Her younger brother is the statistician [[Andrew Gelman]] of [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Susan Gelman on 'How essentialism shapes our thinking'|url=http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-149-susan-gelman-on-how-essentialism-shapes-our-thinking.html |access-date=2018-05-12 |series=Rationally Speaking: Official Podcast of New York City Skeptics |first1=Julia |last1=Galef |first2=Susan|last2=Gelman |date=December 13, 2015  |number=RS 149  |transcript=Full transcript |transcript-url=http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/468275/26732425/1450061194013/rs149transcript.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her PhD advisor was [[Ellen Markman]]. She studies concepts and language in young children and is the author of over 200 publications in [[psychology]] research or related articles.

== Research areas and topics of interest ==
* [[Developmental psychology]]
* [[Cognitive development]]
* [[Language acquisition]]
* [[Categorization]] and [[inductive reasoning]]
* Psychological [[essentialism]]
* Social categories; Ownership, Authenticity, and Object history
* Parent-child conversations
* [[Semantic development]]
* [[Causal reasoning]]
* Relations between language and thought

==Essentialism==
'''Gelman''' has been a major contributor to [[essentialism]] and relating essentialist ideas to varying aspects within the field of psychology. A large number of her publications and contributions have associated [[essentialism]] and involved how its ideas can provide further insight into the field of psychology. Gelman's work within the two fields share a familiar subsection which focuses on the developmental aspect of children. Her work has established that children, within a given age range, are able to detect underlying essences or root causes for predicting observed behaviors. Gelman's role in the furthering of psychological knowledge in regards to child development has given insight into how children acquire language and the thought processing that goes into such acquisitions can be exemplified through her contributions to published works. Her dedication to furthering the understanding of childhood cognitive development.

==The Conceptual Development Lab==
The Conceptual Development Lab is directed by Gelman and is located in the Psychology Department at the [[University of Michigan]]. Most of the studies conducted at the lab focus on children between the ages of 2 and 10, and are carried out in a home-like laboratory setting or in local preschools and middle schools.

==Career==
Popularly known as Damodaran Master, T. Damodaran began his career in cinema as a script writer in early 70s. A physical education teacher in a school at [[Kozhikode]] by profession, Damodaran became active in theatre by late sixties and got into the company of several theatre and cinema artists of the era including [[Thikkodiyan]], [[Kuthiravattom Pappu]], [[Hariharan (director)|Hariharan]], and Kunjandi. He was a part of the Slapstick Theatre, in which Kuthiravattom Pappu was a leading actor. He wrote and acted in several comedies and satires and his dramas were mainly packed with social issues. This was noticed by Hariharan, who forced Damodaran to enter into cinema making. Though, made his debut in 1973, Damodaran became active in cinema by late 70s, after joining with I. V. Sasi with whom he later made around fifty films. It was the huge success of ''[[Angaadi]]'' in 1980 that gave a break to the career of Damodaran. Directed by I. V. Sasi, Angadi had [[Jayan]] and [[Seema (actress)|Seema]] in leading roles and broke several collection records. This was followed by ''Meen'', Kanthavalayam,  and ''Karimbana'', all super hits.

In the 1980s, the scripts of Damodaran created sensation and furore in theatres. The scripts were mainly socio-dramas, which often criticized the establishments and were packed with heavy punch dialogues. Mostly directed by Sasi, these films were well received by general public. ''Thadakam'',  ''Thushaaram'', ''[[Ee Nadu]]'', ''Innalenkil Naale'', ''Iniyenkilum'', ''[[Vartha]]'', ''Angadikappurathu'', ''[[Avanazhi]]'', all were huge hits at box office. Apart from I. V. Sasi, T. Damodaran, also wrote scripts for directors like [[Priyadarshan]], Anil, and [[Bharathan]]. [[Mani Ratnam]]'s first and only film in Malayalam ''[[Unaru]]'' was based on the script by Damodaran in 1985. In the year 1988, Sasi directed a periodic drama based on the script by T. Damodaran, ''[[1921 (Malayalam film)|1921]]'', which was then the most expensive film in Malayalam. T. Damodaran has called this film as his dream project. Appearing [[Mammootty]] in leading, ''[[1921 (Malayalam film)|1921]]'' revolved around the Moppillai mutiny in [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] in 1921 against British. This film was a huge hit at box office.

Though, in 90s, Damodaran reduced the number of films, several hits were born from his pen. ''[[Inspector Balram]]'', ''[[Abhimanyu (1991 film)|Abhimanyu]]'', ''[[Advaitham]]'', and ''[[Kala Pani (1996 film)|Kala Pani]]'' were some among them.  His last release was ''[[Yes Your Honour]]'', directed by [[V. M. Vinu]], starring [[Sreenivasan (actor)|Sreenivasan]], [[Padmapriya]], [[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]], and Saikumar, which also was a hit.

Apart from being a writer Damodaran has acted in quite a few films, most noted roles being Hajiyar with Kalandan in [[Kilichundan Mampazham]] and as K P Hamsa in [[Paleri Manikyam: Oru Pathirakolapathakathinte Katha (film)]] to name a few.These roles were given to him both as an appreciation to his action abilities as well as the respective directors respect to him.

'''Vintage''', in [[winemaking]], is the process of picking grapes and creating the finished product—wine (see [[Harvest (wine)]]). A '''vintage wine''' is one made from grapes that were all, or primarily,  grown and harvested in a single specified year. In certain wines, it can denote quality, as in [[Port wine]], where Port houses make and declare vintage Port in their best years. From this tradition, a common, though incorrect, usage applies the term to any wine that is perceived to be particularly old or of a particularly high quality.

Most countries allow a vintage wine to include a portion of wine that is not from the year denoted on the label. In Chile and South Africa, the requirement is 75% same-year content for vintage-dated wine.&lt;ref&gt;Official Gazette of the Republic of Chile/ Viñas De Chile: Decree 464, Article 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wines of South Africa: labeling requirements (South Africa) paragraph 14; Cape Wine and Spirits Institute&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, New Zealand, and the member states of the European Union, the requirement is 85%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/LegislativeInstrumentCompilation1.nsf/0/4B3106E075F7D419CA2570C000827B8C/$file/AustWineBrandyCorp1981.pdf, Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Regulations 1981], Statutory Rules 1981 No. 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ANZFA Standard P5 and P6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EU Regulation: 1493/99, Annex VIII, E.7&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the requirement is 85%, unless the wine is designated with an [[American Viticultural Area|AVA]], (e.g., Napa Valley), in which case it is 95%. Technically, the 85% rule in the United States applies equally to imports, but there are difficulties in enforcing the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;27 CFR Ch.1 § 4.27&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of a vintage wine is a ''nonvintage'' wine (often seen on a wine list as NV), which is usually a blend from the produce of two or more years. This is a common practice for winemakers seeking a consistent style of wine, year on year.

== Etymology ==
The word vintage was first used in the early 15th century. It was taken from the [[Old French]] ''vendage'', meaning wine harvest. This word was taken from the [[Latin]] ''vinum'' (wine) and ''demere'' (to remove).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/vintage|title = Vintage etymology and Definition|date = |accessdate = 20 December 2015|website = |publisher = Oxford Dictionary|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vintage|title = Etymology of Vintage|date = |accessdate = 20 December 2015|website = |publisher = Etymology Online|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Jacob Philipp Hackert 003.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Vintage near [[Sorrento, Italy]], [[Jacob Philipp Hackert]], c. 1784]]
The importance of vintage, however, is both varied and disputed.

In wine produced on the colder limits of wine production, vintage is often very important, because some seasons will be much warmer and produce [[riper grapes]] and better wine. On the other hand, a poor growing season can lead to grapes low in sugar, which lowers the quality of the resulting wine.

In many wine regions, especially in the [[New World]], growing seasons are much more uniform. In dry regions, the systematic and controlled use of [[irrigation (wine)|irrigation]] also contributes to uniform vintages. However, such wines are regularly labeled by vintage because of consumer demand.

[[File:Champagne millésimé 1995.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Vintage Champagne]]

Wines of superior vintages from prestigious producers and regions will often command much higher prices than those from average vintages. This is especially the case if wines are likely to improve further with some age in the bottle. Some wines are only labeled with a vintage in better-than-average years, to maintain their quality and reputation, while the vast majority of wines are produced to be drunk young and fresh. In such cases, a vintage is usually considered less important. However, it can serve to protect consumers against buying a wine that would not be expected to improve with age and could be past its best, such as with [[Beaujolais nouveau]], a wine style made to be consumed within months of its bottling.

The importance of vintage may sometimes be exaggerated. For example, ''[[New York Times]]'' wine columnist [[Frank J. Prial]] declared the vintage chart to be dead, writing that "winemakers of the world have rendered the vintage chart obsolete" (Prial), and Bill Marsano wrote that "winemakers now have the technology and skills to make good and even very good wines in undistinguished years" (Marsano). [[James Laube]] of  ''[[Wine Spectator]]'' has asserted that "even an average vintage can yield some grand wines" (Laube).

[[File:Vendanges - côtes de Beaune.JPG|right|thumb|Vintages in the [[Côte de Beaune]] in Burgundy]]
===Weil blind tastings===
[[Roman L. Weil|Roman Weil]], co-chairman of the Oenonomy Society of the US and professor at the [[University of Chicago]], tested the controversial hypothesis that experienced wine drinkers "cannot distinguish in [[blind tasting]]s the wine of years rated high from those of years rated low, or, if they can, they do not agree with the vintage chart's preferences" (Weil).

Weil used wines ranging from four to 17 years beyond their vintage with 240 wine drinkers and found that the tasters could not distinguish between wines of good and bad vintages except for [[Bordeaux wine]]s.&lt;ref name=" random process"&gt;[http://www.liquidasset.com/WEILVDQS.PDF Parker v. Prial: The Death of the Vintage Chart] Roman L. Weil, 5/25/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Even when they could make a distinction, the match between the tasters' individual assessments and the charts' rankings were little better than [[tossing a coin]]. When the tests were replicated with wine experts, including [[French wine]] academics, the results were again the same as chance.&lt;ref name=" random process" /&gt;

Weil does not consider a vintage chart to be useless. He suggests using one to help "find good buys in wine. Buy wine from the Appalling years,"&lt;ref name=" random process" /&gt; which may be priced far below actual quality.

*In [[Spanish wine|Spain]], wine regulators publish official classifications of each vintage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9115">[[File:Vladimir Varankin 1931.png|thumb|Varankin in 1931]]
'''Vladimir Valentinovich Varankin''' (12 November 1902 &amp;ndash; 3 October 1938) was a Russian writer of literature in [[Esperanto]], an instructor of western European history, and director of the Moscow Ped. Instituto for foreign languages. He wrote the novel ''[[Metro (novel)|Metropoliteno]]''. [[File:1977 Metropoliteno.jpg|thumb|''Metropoliteno'', edition of 1977]]

==Family background==
Varankin was born in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], in an office worker's family. He was of [[Russians|Russian]] ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historio.ru/varanki.php |title=История эсперанто в России и СССР. Советское движение эсперантистов в документах и цитатах |publisher=Historio.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Valentin Jegorovich Varankin (died 1921), managed a savings bank until he was recruited into the [[Red Army]].  Varankin's mother, Nina Aleksejevna (died 1953), was a librarian.  Besides Vladimir, the family had two other sons: Jurij (born 1906, died 1988) and Vjacheslav (born 1916), who was still alive several years ago.

==Learning Esperanto, early Esperanto activity==
During his last year of study at the city high school (1919), he began learning Esperanto with several friends, boys and girls.  Together with his equally young friends, he soon founded a little city circle of young Esperantists, which later transformed into the provincial (gubernia) circle.  Both in the city and in the gubernia that union carried out an active program:  in less than a year the union managed to organize six courses of Esperanto in the city itself, forty cells and little circles in the whole gubernia, and in addition, in several places, (with the help of local Esperanto instructors) even to teach the international language in the schools.

For one or two years he and his friends vastly developed their Esperanto activity.  Starting then he began active, energetic, impetuous activity.  Besides little circles, courses, and cells, he organized promotional spectaculars and put on sketches, whose text he wrote himself, or translated, or took from pre-revolutionary Esperanto reviews (for example,  from          ''[[La Ondo de Esperanto]]'' ~The Esperanto Wave).  He himself began to publish a newspaper ''[[Ruĝa Esperantisto]]'' ~Red Esperantist.  In this newspaper (under the pseudonym Vol-Volanto 
~Want-Wanter) the twenty-year-old Varankin published his verses and the verses of his 
friends, articles, translations, announcements, survey results, and also calls to the national and foreign Esperanto community to help the hungry in the young soviet republic.   However, at 
that time he wrote in an Esperanto that was full of errors and very russesque.

In 1920 with several friends he even attempted to organize in Nizhny Novgorod the third PanRussian Esperantist Convention, but that failed because chaos and the difficult economic situation in the country did not yet permit organizing the arrangements.  The convention came about one year later in [[Petrograd]], and at the convention they founded [[Sovetlanda (later, sovetrespublikara) Esperantista Unio]]; young Vladimir Varankin was elected as a member of its central committee.

==First jobs==
After school young Vladimir worked for some time in an electric energy organization.  But soon he enrolled in a cavalry school and served there as a political collaborator.  At the same time he was a librarian and club director.  In the autumn of 1922 he moved with the cavalry school to [[Tver]] and immediately began to work actively for Esperanto.

==Administrative Esperanto activity==
He progressed rapidly also within SEU. At the I-st SEU Convention (1923, [[Moscow]]) Varankin was elected a member of the managing board of the convention and reelected as a member of the central committee.  At the end of 1925 the newspaper ''[[Mejxdunarodnyj Jazyk]]'' (~International Language) began to publish a series of his lessons and methods for the advertising of Esperanto, which continued through all of 1926.  Among other things he put the main emphasis not just on advertising but on practical usage. The central committee of the SEU commissioned him to lead the publicity effort.

At the end of 1927 he moved to [[Moscow]], after the nineteenth UK (World Convention of Esperanto) in [[Danzig]].  Among other things, the German veteran Esperantist [[Konstantin Behnert]], who knew Varankin in Tver, tells that after the Danzig UK Varankin visited [[Germany]] without permission and later incautiously mentioned that - with the result that he had to report monthly to register with the police.

== Esperanto publications ==
In 1929 he wrote the textbook ''[[Teorio de Esperanto]]'' (~Theory of Esperanto) and a year later also the textbook ''[[Esperanto por laboristoj]]'' (~Esperanto for Workers).  Vladimir 
Varankin was elected from the beginning a member of the board of secretaries, later director of 
the organizational department, vice president and finally general secretary of the All-Russia 
committee of SEU.  He became a full-fledged member of the Language commission at SEU and 
member of the Language committee at the [[Akademio de Esperanto]] (~Academy of Esperanto).

In 1932 in ''[[Nova Etapo]]'' (~New Stage) the appeared several chapters from ''[[Metro (novel)|Metropoliteno]]'' under the title ''Barikadoj'' (~barricades).

== Professional life ==
Meanwhile, he completed his course at the faculty of social sciences at the Moscow State University the 
Institute of Foreign Affairs and became director of the Technical College of Foreign Languages, where he also taught history.

== Arrest, execution, and exoneration ==
During the night of 7 February 1938 — 8 February 1938 Varankin was arrested.  They condemned him as an active member of Union Center, which never existed; he was accused with spying and sabotage, anti-soviet propaganda, plotting to murder [[Joseph Stalin]]  and the like.

In April 1989 the Procurator's Office of the [[Soviet Union]] officially released the following information: Vladimir Valentinovich Varankin, born in 1902 in Nizhny Novgorod, member of the Communist Party since 1925, expelled from it because of a criminal accusation, director before the arrest of the 2nd Moscow Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages, was sentenced by the Military college of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union to be executed by gunfire and to have all his possessions confiscated on the third of October 1938, for participation in a fascist spy organization "Sojuznyj Centr" (~Union Center), existing under the auspices of the Esperantist organization, with the aim of overthrowing Soviet power through espionage, sabotage, terrorist acts against the leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviet government.  The verdict was carried out on the same day in Moscow without right of appeal or amnesty.  All confiscated possessions, including manuscripts, letters, documents, archives, books were destroyed as "ideologically unuseful" and "without any current or historical value".  The official answer says that "the place of burial is not indicated in the file".

Twenty years later the Military college of the Supreme Court looked into the matter.  The investigation revealed that V. Varankin was convicted totally without basis, and in connection with that the Military college of the Supreme court of the Soviet Union nullified the verdict on 11 May 1957 and threw out the accusation as having an absolute lack of criminal content.  V. Varankin was fully exonerated.

'''''Wren &amp; Martin''''' refers to a single book ''High School English Grammar and Composition'' or collectively, a series of English [[grammar]] textbooks written jointly by [[P. C. Wren]] and [[H. Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhatia|first=Sidharth|title=Looking for my copy of Wren &amp; Martin|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/opinion/column_looking-for-my-copy-of-wren-and-martin_1273151|newspaper=DNA|date=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written primarily for the children of [[British_Army|British officers]] residing in [[India]], these books were widely adopted by [[India|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] schools in the post-colonial era and missionary schools in [[Burma]]. The books were published in 1935, with a discussion on [[Composition (language)|composition]] added later. The content in the books is largely based on ''[[The Manual of English Grammar and Composition]]'' by [[J. C. Nesfield]].

Other books in this series are ''Elementary English Grammar'', ''A First Book of English Grammar and Composition'', ''High School English Grammar and Composition'' and ''A Final Course of Grammar &amp; Composition''. The series of textbooks is still in use at many Indian schools.  While [[semantic change]] has dated the original books, they continue to enjoy considerable popularity and updated versions are now in common use. Copies of the different versions of this series are available online.&lt;ref&gt;
