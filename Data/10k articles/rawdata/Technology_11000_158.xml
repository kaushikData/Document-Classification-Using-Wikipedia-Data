      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11606">'''4D BIM''', an acronym for 4D [[Building Information Modeling]] and a term widely used in the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] industry, refers to the intelligent linking of individual [[3D CAD]] components or assemblies with time- or schedule-related information.&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-01/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mills|first1=Fred|title=What is 4D BIM?|url=http://www.theb1m.com/video/what-is-4d-bim|website=www.TheB1M.com|publisher=The B1M Limited|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;The use of the term 4D is intended to refer to the fourth dimension: time, i.e. 4D is 3D plus schedule (time).&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-02/&gt; 

The construction of the 4D models enables the various participants (from architects, designers, contractors to clients) of a construction project, to visualize the entire duration of a series of events and display the progress of construction activities through the lifetime of the project.&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-03/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-04/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-05/&gt; This BIM-centric approach towards project management technique has a very high potential to improve the project management and delivery of construction project, of any size or complexity.

==History==
In 1998, Sir [[John Egan (industrialist)|John Egan]], in his report ''[[Egan Report|Rethinking Construction]]'',&lt;ref name=Egan&gt;Egan, J. (1998) ''Rethinking Construction: Report of the Construction Task Force'', London: HMSO. (Copy of report available on Constructing Excellence website: [http://www.constructingexcellence.org.uk/pdf/rethinking%20construction/rethinking_construction_report.pdf report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108223227/http://www.constructingexcellence.org.uk/pdf/rethinking%20construction/rethinking_construction_report.pdf |date=2011-11-08 }}. Accessed: 8 September 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that certain principles and management techniques could successfully cross-over from other industries like manufacturing to serve the project delivery demands of the construction industry. The Egan Report cited "Technology as a Tool":

:"One area in which we know new technology to be a very useful tool is in the design of buildings and their components, and in the exchange of design information throughout the construction team. There are enormous benefits to be gained, in terms of eliminating waste and rework for example, from using modern CAD technology to prototype buildings and by rapidly exchanging information on design changes. Redesign should take place on computer, not on the construction site."

4D BIM adds a new dimension (time) to 3D CAD or solid modelling, it enables a sequence of events to be depicted visually on a time line that has been populated by a 3D model (augmenting traditional Gantt charts and Critical Path (CPM) schedules often used in project management).&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-16/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-17/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-19/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-20/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-21/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-22/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-23/&gt; Construction sequences can be reviewed as a series of problems using 4D BIM, enabling users to explore options, manage solutions and optimize results. It enables construction product development, collaborative and transparent project implementation, partnering with the supply chain and production of components, and is in keeping with Egan's vision: "sustained improvement should then be delivered through use of techniques for eliminating waste and increasing value for the customer."

As an advanced construction management technique, it is increasingly used by project delivery teams working on larger projects.&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-08/&gt; For example, it is used in the construction of projects including tall buildings, bridges, highways, tunnels, university campuses and hospital complexes, luxury residential, residential and infrastructure such as courthouses, levee systems, hydro-electric power generation stations, mining and industrial process facilities. 4D BIM has traditionally been used for higher end projects due to the associated costs, but technologies are now emerging that allow the process to be used by laymen or to drive processes such as manufacture.&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-14/&gt;

{{Merge |Compressed air dryer |date=March 2018 }}
A compressed '''air dryer''' is used for removing [[water vapor]] from compressed air. Compressed air dryers are commonly found in a wide range of industrial and commercial facilities.

The process of air compression concentrates atmospheric contaminants, including water vapor. This raises the [[dew point]] of the compressed air relative to free atmospheric air and leads to condensation within pipes and the compressed air cools downstream of the compressor.

Excessive water in compressed air, in either the liquid or vapor phase, can cause a variety of operational problems for users of compressed air. These include freezing of outdoor air lines, corrosion in piping and equipment, malfunctioning of pneumatic [[process control]] instruments, fouling of processes and products, and more.

There are various types of compressed air dryers. Their performance characteristics are typically defined by the dew point.
* Regenerative desiccant dryers, often called "regens" or "twin tower" dryers
* Refrigerated dryers
* [[Deliquescence|Deliquescent]] dryers
* Membrane dryers

Water vapor is removed from compressed air to prevent condensation from occurring and to prevent moisture from interfering in sensitive industrial processes.

==Characteristics==
* A regenerative desiccant dryer typically delivers a [[dew point]] of between −40&amp;nbsp;°F (−40&amp;nbsp;°C) and −100&amp;nbsp;°F (−73&amp;nbsp;°C)
* A refrigerated dryer delivers a dew point not lower than approximately 35&amp;nbsp;°F (2&amp;nbsp;°C)
* A deliquescent dryer delivers a dew point suppression that fluctuates with air temperature. Typically this suppression is 20&amp;nbsp;°F (11&amp;nbsp;°C) below the compressed air temperature.

==Refrigerated dryer==

Refrigeration dryers employ two [[heat exchanger]]s, one for air-to-air and one for air-to-refrigeration. However, there is also a single [[TRISAB]] heat exchanger that combines both functions. The [[Gas compressor|compressors]] used in this type of dryer are usually of the hermetic type and the most common gas used is [[R-134a and R-410a]] for smaller air dryers up to 100 cfm. Older and larger dryers still use R-22 and R-404a refrigerants. The goal of having two heat exchangers is that the cold outgoing air cools down the hot incoming air and reduces the size of compressor required. At the same time the increase in the temperature of outgoing air prevents re-condensation.

Some manufacturers produce "cycling dryers". These store a cold mass that cools the air when the compressor is OFF. When the refrigeration compressor runs, the large mass takes much longer to cool, so the compressor runs longer, and stays OFF longer. These units operate at lower dew points, typically in the 35–40&amp;nbsp;°F range. When selected with the optional "cold coalescing filter", these units can deliver compressed air with lower dew points. Non-cycling dryers use a hot gas by pass valve to prevent the dryer from icing up.

Some manufacturers produce "cold coalescing filters" that are positioned inside of the air dryer at the point of the lowest air temperature (the point at which maximum condensation has occurred).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spxflow.com/en/assets/pdf/BC-100-2013_web_tcm11-8920.pdf |title=SPX Hankinson &amp;#124; Page 3 of 12, Intergal 3 micron cold coalsecing filter, optional cold coalescing oil removal filter |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newgatetechnologies.com/brochurepdfs/RefBrch.pdf |title=Newgate Technologies &amp;#124; Air Dryer with Cold Coalescing Filter |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manufacturers are marketing compressors with built-in refrigeration dryers, but these have had a mixed acceptance in the market.

==Deliquescent dryer==

A deliquescent dryer typically consists of a pressure vessel filled with a hygroscopic medium that absorbs water vapor. The medium gradually dissolves—or deliquesces—to form a solution at the base of the pressure vessel. The liquid must be regularly drained from the vessel and new medium must be added. The medium is usually in tablet or briquette form.

Deliquescent dryers have no moving parts and don't require electrical power for operation. Common applications therefore often involve remote, hazardous, or mobile work sites. Deliquescent dryers are used for removing water vapor from compressed air, natural gas, and waste gases such as [[landfill gas]] and [[digester gas]].

The performance of a deliquescent dryer, as measured by outlet dew point, is highly dependent on the temperature of the air or gas being processed, with cooler temperatures resulting in better performance

==Desiccant dryer==

The term "desiccant dryer" refers to a broad class of dryers. Other terms commonly used are regenerative dryer and twin tower dryer, and to a lesser extent adsorption dryer.

The compressed air is passed through a pressure vessel with two "towers" filled with a media such as activated alumina, [[silica gel]], molecular sieve or other [[desiccant]] material. This desiccant material attracts the water from the compressed air via adsorbtion. As the water clings to the desiccant, the desiccant "bed" becomes saturated. The dryer is timed to switch towers based on a standard NEMA cycle, once this cycle completes some compressed air from the system is used to "purge" the saturated desiccant bed by simply blowing the water that has adhered to the desiccant off.

The duty of the desiccant is to bring the pressure dew point of the compressed air to a level in which the water will no longer condense, or to remove as much water from the compressed air as possible. A standard dew point that is expected by a regenerative dryer is −40&amp;nbsp;°C (−40&amp;nbsp;°F); this means that when the air leaves the dryer there is as much water in the air as if the air had been "cooled" to −40&amp;nbsp;°C (−40&amp;nbsp;°F). Required dew point is dependent on application and −70&amp;nbsp;°C is required in some applications. Many newer dryers come equipped with a dew dependent switching (DDS) which allows for the dryer to detect dew point and shorten or lengthen the drying cycle to fulfill the required dew point. Oftentimes this will save significant amounts of energy which is one of the largest factors when determining the proper compressed air system.

The regeneration of the desiccant vessel can be during three different methods:
* Heatless "pressure-swing" drying, which uses part of the dry compressed air coming from the other vessel to dry the desiccant in the vessel being regenerated at lower pressure. 17-20% purge rate
* Heated dryer, which uses a hot air blower, so there is no loss of compressed air. &gt;7% Purge Rate.
* Heat of compression, which can only be used with an oilfree compressor.

==Membrane dryer==
{{See also|Membrane gas separation}}
''Membrane dryer'' refers to a dehumidification membrane that removes water vapor from compressed air.

Typically, the compressed air is first filtered with a high-quality [[coalescer|coalescing]] filter. This filter removes liquid water, oil and particulate from the compressed air. The water vapor–laden air then passes through the center bore of hollow fibers in the membrane bundle. At the same time, a small portion of the dry air product is redirected along the outside surface of the fibers to sweep out the water vapor which has permeated the membrane. The moisture-laden sweep gas is then vented to the atmosphere, and clean, dry air is supplied to the application. The membrane air dryers are designed to operate continuously, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Membrane air dryers are quiet, reliable and require no electricity to operate.

Some dryers are non-porous, which means they only permeate water vapor. Non-porous membranes' drying power is only a function of flow rate, pressure. The sweep flow is strictly controlled by an orifice and is not a function of temperature.

Porous membranes are modified [[nitrogen membrane]]s and pass air as well, usually changing the composition of the compressed air by reducing the oxygen content. The only maintenance required is changing the prefilter cartridge twice a year. The performance of porous membranes are dependent on temperature as well as operating pressure and flow.

Membrane air dryers depress the incoming dew point. Most dryers have a challenge air dew point and pressure specification. So if the inlet dew point is lower than the specified challenge air then the outlet dew point is even lower than specified. For example, a dryer could be rated at a −40&amp;nbsp;°F dew point with a challenge of +70&amp;nbsp;°F dew point and 100&amp;nbsp;psig. If the incoming air has an inlet dew point of only 32&amp;nbsp;°F, the outlet dew point will be somewhat less. Pressure also plays a role. If the pressure is higher than the rated specification then the outlet dew point will be lowered. This lowering of the outlet dew point is due to the longer residence time that the air has inside the membrane. Using the spec above, an operating pressure of 120&amp;nbsp;psig will yield a lower outlet dew point than specified. The extent of the improvement is dependent on the nature of the membrane and could vary among manufacturers.

Dew point suppression is not a feature of refrigerated dryers, as they chill the incoming air to a fixed temperature, usually 35&amp;nbsp;°F. So a lower dew point challenge will not yield a dew point lower than 35&amp;nbsp;°F.

Membrane air dryers are used in pneumatic components, spray painting, laser plenum purge, air bearings, air spindles, medical equipment, air guns and pneumatic brakes for vehicles and trains.

==Usage==
* Drying air for use in commercial or industrial processes that demand dry air:
** Telecomm industry (pressurizes its underground cables to repel moisture and avoid shorts)
** Painting
** Pneumatic tools
** Textile manufacturing
** Pneumatic control systems
** Feed air for [[zeolite]] type [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] generators
** Dental office air
* Truck and train air brake systems.
* Submarine ballast tank blow systems (implemented on American submarines after [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)]] disaster)

[[File:Foggara 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Arabs transformed [[agriculture]] during the [[Golden Age of Islam]] by spreading major crops and techniques such as [[irrigation]] across the [[Old World]].]]
The '''Arab Agricultural Revolution''' is the transformation in [[agriculture]] from the [[Golden Age of Islam|8th to the 13th century in the Islamic region]] of the [[Old World]]. The [[agronomy|agronomic]] literature of the time, with major books by [[Ibn Bassal]] and [[Abū l-Khayr al-Ishbīlī]], demonstrates the extensive diffusion of useful plants to Medieval Spain ([[al-Andalus]]), and the growth in [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic scientific knowledge]] of agriculture and [[horticulture]]. Medieval Arab historians and geographers described al-Andalus as a fertile and prosperous region with abundant water, full of fruit from trees such as the [[olive]] and [[pomegranate]]. Archaeological evidence demonstrates improvements in [[animal husbandry]] and in [[irrigation]] such as with the ''[[sakia]]'' water wheel. These changes made agriculture far more productive, supporting population growth, urbanisation, and increased stratification of society.

The revolution was first described by the historian Antonio Garcia Maceira in 1876.{{sfn|Ruggles|2000|pages=31–32}} The name{{efn|The Arab Agricultural Revolution{{sfn|Watson|1974|pp=8–35}} has also variously been called the Medieval Green Revolution,{{sfn|Watson|1981|pp=}}{{sfn|Glick|1977|pp=644–50}} the Muslim Agricultural Revolution,{{sfn|Idrisi|2005|pp=}} the Islamic Agricultural Revolution{{sfn|Decker|2009}} and the Islamic Green Revolution.{{sfn|Burke|2009|p=174}}}} was coined by the historian Andrew Watson in an influential{{sfn|Decker|2009}}{{sfn|Squatriti|2014|pp=1205–1220}} but at the time controversial 1974 paper. However, 40 years on, it has proven useful to historians and has been supported by findings in archaeology and [[archaeobotany]].{{sfn|Squatriti|2014|pp=1205–1220}}

==Medieval Islamic agronomy==
[[File:Arboriculture Mediaeval Islam.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Medieval Islamic [[arboriculture]]: [[Ibn Bassal]] and [[Abū l-Khayr al-Ishbīlī]] described in detail how to propagate and care for trees such as [[olive]] and [[date palm]].]]
{{see also|Science in the medieval Islamic world}}

The first Arabic book on [[agronomy]] to reach al-Andalus, in the 10th century, was [[Ibn Wahshiyya]]'s ''al-Filahat al-nabatiyya'' ([[Nabatean]] Agriculture), from Iraq; it was followed by texts written in al-Andalus, such as the ''Mukhtasar kitab al-filaha'' (Abridged Book of Agriculture) by [[Al-Zahrawi]] (Abulcasis) from Cordoba, around 1000 AD.{{sfn|Ruggles|2008|pp=32–35}}

The eleventh century agronomist [[Ibn Bassal]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] described 177 species in his ''Dīwān al-filāha'' (The Court of Agriculture). Ibn Bassal had travelled widely across the Islamic world, returning with a detailed knowledge of agronomy. His practical and systematic book both gives detailed descriptions of useful plants including leaf and root vegetables, herbs, spices and trees, and explains how to propagate and care for them.&lt;ref name=IbnBassal&gt;{{cite web |title=Ibn Baṣṣāl: Dīwān al-filāḥa / Kitāb al-qaṣd wa’l-bayān |url=http://www.filaha.org/author_Ibn_bassal.html |website=The Filaha Texts Project: The Arabic Books of Husbandry |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al-Wasiti-Discussion near a village.jpg|thumb|upright|Village scene with poultry, sheep and goats from a copy of the ''[[Maqamat al-Hariri]]'' illustrated by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|al-Wasiti]], 1237]]

The twelfth century agronomist [[Abū l-Khayr al-Ishbīlī]] of [[Seville]] described in minute detail in his ''Kitāb al-Filāha'' (Treatise on Agriculture) how [[olive]] trees should be grown, [[Grafting|graft]]ed, treated for disease, and harvested, and gave similar detail for crops such as cotton.{{sfn|Zaimeche|2002}}

Medieval Islamic agronomists including Ibn Bassal and Abū l-Khayr described [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[horticulture|horticultural]] techniques including how to propagate the olive and the [[date palm]], [[crop rotation]] of [[flax]] with [[wheat]] or [[barley]], and [[companion planting]] of [[grape]] and olive.{{sfn|Ruggles|2008|pp=32–35}}{{sfn|Zaimeche|2002}} These books demonstrate the importance of agriculture both as a traditional practice and as a scholarly science.{{sfn|Ruggles|2008|pp=32–35}} In al-Andalus, there is evidence that the almanacs and manuals of agronomy helped to catalyse change, causing scholars to seek out new kinds of vegetable and fruit, and to carry out experiments in botany; in turn, these helped to improve actual practice in the region's agriculture.{{sfn|Ruggles|2008|p=36}} During the 11th century [[Abbadid dynasty]] in Seville, the [[sultan]] took a personal interest in fruit production, discovering from a peasant the method he had used to grow some exceptionally large [[melon]]s—pinching off all but ten of the buds, and using wooden props to hold the stems off the ground.{{sfn|Ruggles|2008|p=36}}

==Medieval Islamic animal husbandry==
[[File:Antonino Leto - Arab sheep herders.jpg|thumb|Arab sheep herders, by [[Antonio Leto]]]]

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence from the measurement of bones ([[osteometry]]) demonstrates that [[sheep]] in southern Portugal increased in size during the Islamic period, while cattle increased when the area became Christian after [[Reconquista|its reconquest]]. The archaeologist Simon Davis assumes that the change in size signifies improvement by [[animal husbandry]], while in his view the choice of sheep is readily explained by the Islamic liking for [[mutton]].{{sfn|Davis|2008|pp=991–1010}}

==Medieval Islamic irrigation==
[[File:بحر يوسف بمدينة المنيا.jpg|thumb|left|The ancient [[Bahr Yussef]] canal connects the [[Fayyum]] depression to the [[River Nile]] some 25 km away.]]

The Islamic period in the [[Fayyum]] depression of Middle Egypt, like medieval Islamic Spain (al-Andalus), was characterised by extremely large-scale systems of irrigation, with both the supply, via gravity-fed canals, and the management of water under local tribal control.{{sfn|Rapoport|Shahar|2012|pp=1–31}} In the Islamic period in al-Andalus, whose rural parts were equally tribal,{{sfn|Rapoport|Shahar|2012|pp=1–31}} the irrigation canal network was much enlarged.{{sfn|Jayyusi|1994|pp=974–986}} Similarly, in the Fayyum, new villages were established in the period, and new water-dependent orchards and sugar plantations were developed.{{sfn|Rapoport|Shahar|2012|pp=1–31}}

[[File:The "Persian Wheel.".jpg|thumb|The animal-powered ''[[sakia]]'' irrigation wheel was improved in and diffused further from Islamic Spain.]]

The ''[[sakia]]''{{efn|Glick uses the term ''[[noria]]'', but states that it is animal-powered,{{sfn|Glick|1977|pp=644–50}} for which ''[[sakia]]'' is the more usual name.}} or animal-powered irrigation wheel was likely introduced to Islamic Spain in early [[Umayyad]] times (in the 7th century). Improvements to it were described by Hispano-Arabic agronomists in the 11th and 12th centuries. From there, ''sakia'' irrigation was spread further around Spain and Morocco.{{sfn|Glick|1977|pp=644–50}} A 13th century observer claimed there were "5000" waterwheels along the [[Guadalquivir]] in Islamic Spain; even allowing for medieval exaggeration,{{sfn|Ruggles|2007}} irrigation systems were certainly extensive in the region at that time. The supply of water was sufficient for cities as well as agriculture: the [[Roman aqueduct]] network into the city of [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] was repaired in the [[Umayyad]] period, and extended.{{sfn|Ruggles|2007}}

==Medieval accounts of Islamic Spain==

Medieval Arab historians such as [[Ibn Bassam]], [[Ibn Hayyan]], and [[Ibn Hazm]], and geographers such as [[al-Bakri]],{{sfn|Lévi-Provençal|2012}}{{sfn|Meri|2006|p=96}} [[al-Idrisi]],&lt;ref name=IdrisiFilaha/&gt; and [[Al-Zuhri]], described Islamic Spain as a fortunate entity.{{sfn|Scales|1993|p=3}}{{sfn|Decter|2007|pp=20–21, 35}} Indeed, the tenth-century Jewish scribe Menahem Ben Saruq wrote to the Khazar king "The name of our land in which we dwell ... in the language of the Arabs, the inhabitants of the land, al-Andalus ... the land is rich, abounding in rivers, springs, and aqueducts; a land of [[wheat|corn]], [[olive oil|oil]], and [[wine]], of fruits and all manner of delicacies; it has pleasure-gardens and orchards, fruitful trees of every kind, including ... [the [[Morus alba|white mulberry]]] upon which the [[silkworm]] feeds".{{sfn|Decter|2007|pp=20–21, 35}} [[Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari|al-Maqqari]], quoting the ninth-century Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Musa al-Razi, describes al-Andalus as a rich land "with good, arable soil, fertile settlements, flowing copiously with plentiful rivers and fresh springs."{{sfn|Decter|2007|pp=20–21, 35}} Al-Andalus was associated with cultivated trees like olive and [[pomegranate]]. After the [[Reconquista|Christian reconquest]], arable farming was frequently abandoned, the land reverting to pasture, though some farmers tried to adopt Islamic agronomy.&lt;!--p. 35--&gt;{{sfn|Decter|2007|p=35}} Western historians have wondered if the Medieval Arab historians were reliable, given that they had a motive to emphasize the splendour of al-Andalus, but evidence from archaeology has broadly supported their claims.{{sfn|Schildgen|2016|p=84}}{{sfn|Ruggles|2000|pp=31–32}}

==A revolution in agriculture==
[[File:Islamic Spain agricultural scene.jpg|thumb|upright|Agricultural scene from a mediaeval Arabic manuscript from [[Al-Andalus]] (Islamic Spain) c. 1200]]

In 1876, the historian Antonia Garcia Maceira argued that where the Romans and then the Goths who farmed in Spain made little effort to improve their crops or to import species from other regions, under "the Arabs", there was an agricultural "revolution" in [[Al-Andalus]] (Islamic Spain) caused "by implementing the knowledge that they acquired through observation during their peregrinations,{{efn|However "mythical"{{sfn|Ruggles|2000|pages=31–32}} the idea of the wandering Arab, Ibn Bassal was indeed widely travelled and wrote from his own observations.&lt;ref name=IbnBassal/&gt;}} and the result was extensive agricultural settlement."{{sfn|Ruggles|2000|pages=31–32}}

In 1974, the historian Andrew Watson published a paper{{sfn|Watson|1974|pp=8–35}} proposing an extension of Garcia Maceira's hypothesis of agricultural revolution in [[Al-Andalus]].{{sfn|Ruggles|2000|pages=15–34}}{{efn|In Paolo Squatriti's view, Watson's thesis also recalled the Belgian economic historian [[Henri Pirenne]]'s 1939 view of the way that a seventh century Islamic maritime power in the Mediterranean had prevented Europe from trading there.{{sfn|Squatriti|2014|pp=1205–1220}}}} Watson argued that the economy established by [[Arab]] and other [[Islamic economics in the world|Muslim traders]] across the [[Old World]] enabled the diffusion of many crops and farming techniques throughout the Islamic world, as well as the adaptation of crops and techniques from and to regions outside it. Crops from Africa, such as [[sorghum]], from China, such as [[citrus fruit]]s, and from India, such as [[mango]], [[rice]], [[cotton]] and [[sugar cane]], were distributed throughout Islamic lands, which he believed had not previously grown these plants.{{sfn|Watson|1974|pp=8–35}} He listed eighteen such crops.{{sfn|Decker|2009|pp=187–188}}{{efn|Decker wrote: "In support of his thesis, Watson charted the advance of seventeen food crops and one fiber crop that became important over a large area of the Mediterranean world during the first four centuries of Islamic rule (roughly the seventh through eleventh centuries C.E.)"{{sfn|Decker|2009|pp=187–188}} The food crops named by Watson were [[rice]], [[sorghum]], [[durum wheat]], [[sugar cane]], [[watermelon]], [[aubergine]] (eggplant), [[spinach]], [[artichoke]], [[taro]], [[pomelo|sour orange]] (pomelo), [[lemon]], [[lime (fruit)|lime]], [[banana]], [[cooking plantain|plantain]], [[mango]], and [[coconut]]; the fibre was [[cotton]].}} Watson suggested that these introductions, along with an increased [[mechanization]] of agriculture and [[irrigation]], led to major changes in economy, [[population distribution]], vegetation cover,{{sfn|Watson|2008}} agricultural production and income, population, [[Urbanization|urban growth]], distribution of the labour force, industries linked to agriculture, cooking, diet and clothing in the Islamic world.{{sfn|Watson|1974|pp=8–35}}

[[File:Irrigating by hand, Afghanistan, 1976.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Irrigating by hand in the 20th century]]

In 1997, the historian of science Howard R. Turner wrote that Islamic study of soil, climate, seasons and ecology "promoted a remarkably advanced horticulture and agriculture. The resulting knowledge, transmitted to Europe after the eleventh century, helped to improve farming techniques, widen the variety of crops, and increase yields on the continent's farmlands. In addition, an enormous variety of crops was introduced to the West from or through Muslim lands".{{sfn|Turner|1997|p=173}}

The historian of Islam Salah Zaimeche stated in 2002 that the "accepted wisdom" that agriculture was not improved until the last few centuries in Europe had been overturned by work by Watson, Thomas Glick{{sfn|Glick|1996}} and L. Bolens&lt;ref&gt;For example Bolens 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; among others.{{sfn|Zaimeche|2002}}

In 2006, James E. McClellan III and Harold Dorn stated in their book ''Science and Technology in World History'' that Islam had depended as much on its farmers as its soldiers, and that the farmers had helped to create a "scientific civilisation": "in what amounted to an agricultural revolution they adapted new and more diversified food crops to the Mediterranean ecosystem: rice, sugar cane, cotton, melons, citrus fruits, and other products. With rebuilt and enlarged systems of irrigation, Islamic farming extended the growing season and increased productivity."{{sfn|McClellan|Dorn|2006|p=102}} They stated further that the importance of these efforts was indicated by the "uninterrupted series" of books on agriculture and irrigation; another indication was provided by the many books on particular animals of importance to Islamic farming and government, including horses and bees. They ascribed the population growth, urbanisation, social stratification, centralisation of politics and state-controlled scholarship to the improvement in agricultural productivity.{{sfn|McClellan|Dorn|2006|p=102}}

[[File:PalacioDelGeneralife.JPG|thumb|[[Islamic Golden Age]] innovation: the [[Moors]] brought a new architecture, including gardens with water engineering, as in the [[Alhambra]]'s Generalife Palace, to [[Al-Andalus]].]]

By 2008, the [[archaeozoology|archaeozoologist]] Simon Davis could write without qualification that in the Iberian peninsula "Agriculture flourished: the Moslems introduced new irrigation techniques and new plants like sugar cane, rice, cotton, spinach, pomegranates and citrus trees, to name just a few... [[Seville]] had become a Mecca for agronomists, and its hinterland, or ''Aljarafe''&lt;!--original italics--&gt;, their laboratory."{{sfn|Davis|2008|pp=991–1010}}

===Early scepticism===

Watson's work was met with some early scepticism, such as from the historian Jeremy Johns in 1984. Johns argued that Watson's selection of 18 plants was "peculiar", since the [[banana]], [[coconut]], [[mango]] and [[pomelo|shaddock]] were unimportant in the Islamic region at the time, detracting from the discussion of the staple crops. Johns further noted that the evidence of diffusion of crops was imperfect, that Watson made "too many minor slips and larger errors" such as getting dates wrong or claiming that a 1439 document was [[Normans|Norman]], and had failed to make best use of the evidence that was available, such as of the decline of classical agriculture, or even to mention the changing [[geomorphology]]. Johns however concluded that "The hypothesis of an 'Abbasid agricultural revolution is challenging and may well prove useful".{{sfn|Johns|1984|pp=343–4}}{{sfn|Cahen|1986|p=217}}

The historian [[Eliyahu Ashtor]] wrote in 1976 that agricultural production declined in the period immediately after the [[Arab conquest]] in areas of [[Iraq|Mesopotamia]] and [[Egypt]], on the limited basis of records of taxes collected on cultivated areas.{{sfn|Ashtor|1976|pp=58–63}} In a 2012 paper focusing on the [[Sawād]] area of Iraq, Michele Campopiano concluded that Iraqi agricultural output declined in the 7th to 10th century; he attributed this decline to "competition of the different ruling groups to gain access to land surplus".{{sfn|Campopiano|2012|pp=1–37}}

===Diffusion not revolution===
[[File:The Albolafia Water Mill (10823918983).jpg|thumb|left|Roman and Islamic  systems: the [[Mills of the Guadalquivir|Albolafia irrigation water wheel]] in front of [[Roman bridge of Córdoba|the Roman bridge at Córdoba]], Spain.{{sfn|Brebbia|2017|p=341}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albolafia|url=https://alcazardelosreyescristianos.cordoba.es/?id=666&amp;ad=true&amp;lang=3|website=Alcazar of the Christian Monarchs|accessdate=28 December 2017|date=2011|quote=The most plausible hypothesis points to an Almoravid construction from 1136-1137.

The watermill was operational up until the end of the fifteenth century, when, according to tradition, Queen Isabella the Catholic ordered it to be taken down because the noise it produced prevented her from sleeping.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 2009, the historian Michael Decker{{sfn|Decker|2009|p=191}}{{efn|Decker wrote "Nothing has been written, however that attacks the central pillar of Watson's thesis, namely the 'basket' of plants that is inextricably linked to all other elements of his analysis. This work will therefore assess the place and importance of four crops of the 'Islamic Agricultural Revolution' for which there is considerable pre-Islamic evidence in the Mediterranean world."{{sfn|Decker|2009|p=191}}}} stated that widespread cultivation and consumption of four staples, namely [[durum wheat]], [[Rice|Asiatic rice]], [[sorghum]] and [[cotton]] were already commonplace under the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Sassanid Empire]], centuries before the Islamic period.{{sfn|Decker|2009|p=191}} He suggested that their actual role in Islamic agriculture had been exaggerated, arguing that the agricultural practices of Muslim cultivators did not fundamentally differ from those of pre-Islamic times, but evolved from the hydraulic know-how and 'basket' of agricultural plants inherited from their Roman and Persian predecessors.{{sfn|Decker|2009|p=187}} In the case of cotton, which the Romans grew mainly in Egypt, the plant remained a minor crop in the classical Islamic period: the major fibre was flax, as in Roman times.{{sfn|Decker|2009|p=205}} Decker further asserted that the advanced state of ancient [[irrigation]] practices "rebuts sizeable parts of the Watson thesis," since for example in Spain, archaeological work indicated that the Islamic irrigation system was developed from the existing Roman network, rather than replacing it.{{sfn|Decker|2009|p=190}} Decker agreed that "Muslims made an important contribution to world farming through the westward diffusion of some crops", but that the introduction of "agronomic techniques and materials" had been less widespread and less consistent than Watson had suggested.{{sfn|Decker|2009|p=191}} Furthermore, there is clear evidence that agricultural devices such as [[watermill]]s and [[waterwheel]]s, [[shaduf]]s, [[noria]]s, [[sakia]]s, [[water screw]]s and [[water pump]]s were widely known and applied in [[Agriculture in ancient Greece|Greco]]-[[Roman agriculture]] long before the Muslim conquests.{{sfn|Oleson|2000|pp=183–216}}{{sfn|Wikander|2000|pp=371–400}}

===Revolution driven by social institutions===

{| class="wikitable floatright" width=300px
| The main trade of [Seville] is in [olive] oils which are exported to the east and the west by land and sea. These oils come from a district called al-Sharaf which extends for 40 milles and which is entirely planted with olives and figs. It reaches from Seville as far as Niébla, having a width of more than 12 milles. It comprises, it is said, eight thousand thriving villages, with a great number of baths and fine houses.—[[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], 12th century&lt;ref name=IdrisiFilaha&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of Aljarafe, Al-Andalus, in the mid-12th century, by the geographer Abū Abd Allāh Muḥammad al-Idrīsi|url=http://www.filaha.org/abu-abd-allah-muhammad-al-Idrisi-12-century.html|website=The Filaha Texts Project {{!}} The Arabic Books of Husbandry|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. Fairchild Ruggles]] rejected the view that the medieval Arab historians had been wrong to claim that agriculture had been revolutionised, and that it had instead simply been restored to a state like that before the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]]. She argued that while the medieval Arab historians may not have had a reliable picture of agricultural knowledge before their time, they were telling the truth about a dramatic change to the landscape of Islamic Spain. A whole new "system of crop rotation, fertilization, transplanting, grafting, and irrigation" was swiftly and systematically put into place under a new legal framework of land ownership and tenancy. In her view, therefore, there was indeed an agricultural revolution in al-Andalus, but it consisted principally of new social institutions rather than of new agronomic techniques.{{sfn|Ruggles|2000|pp=31–32}} Ruggles stated that this "dramatic economic, scientific, and social transformation" began in al-Andalus and had spread throughout the Islamic Mediterranean by the 10th century.{{sfn|Ruggles|2008|p=36}}

===Historiography===

Looking back over 40 years of scholarship since Watson's theory, the historian of land use Paolo Squatriti{{efn|Squatriti is known for works on medieval land use such as ''Landscape and Change in Early Medieval Italy'', Cambridge University Press, 2013.}} wrote in 2014 that the thesis had been widely used and cited by historians and archaeologists working in different fields. It "proved to be applicable in scholarly debates about technological diffusion in pre-industrial societies, the 'decline' of Islamic civilization, the relations between elite and peasant cultural systems, Europe's historical [[Sonderweg]] in the second millennium CE, the origins of globalization, [and] the nature of Mediterraneity." Squatriti noted that Watson had originally trained in economics, and applied this interest to his historical studies. Squatriti described Watson's paper as concise and elegant, and popular for its usefulness in supporting the theses of many different historians&lt;!--p. 1215--&gt;. He observed that Watson's thesis did not depend on claims of new introductions of plants into any region, but of their "diffusion and normalization", i.e. of their becoming widely and generally used, even if they were known from Roman times. Calling Watson's "philological" approach "old fashioned", and given that Watson had worked "virtually without archaeology"&lt;!--p. 1215--&gt;, Squatrini expressed surprise that recent research in archaeobotany had failed to "decisively undermine" Watson's thesis.{{sfn|Squatriti|2014|pp=1205–1220}}

'''Beatrice Alice Hicks''' (January 2, 1919&amp;nbsp;– October 21, 1979) was an American [[engineer]], the first woman engineer to be hired by [[Western Electric]], and both co-founder and first president of the [[Society of Women Engineers]].&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{cite web |title= Beatrice Alice Hicks |url= http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Beatrice_Alice_Hicks |work= IEEE Global History Network |publisher= Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |accessdate= October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite entering the field at a time where engineering was seen as an inappropriate career for a woman, Hicks held a variety of leadership positions and eventually became the owner of an engineering firm. During her time there, Hicks developed a gas density switch that would be used in the U.S. space program, including the [[Apollo program|Apollo moon landing missions]].

==Early life==

Beatrice Hicks was born in 1919 in [[Orange, New Jersey]], to William Lux Hicks, a chemical engineer, and Florence Benedict.&lt;ref name=Notable&gt;{{cite book |first1= Edward T. |last1= James |first2= Janet Wilson |last2= James |first3= Paul S. |last3= Boyer |title= Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 5: Completing the Twentieth Century |year= 2004 |publisher= Belknap Press |location= Cambridge, MA |isbn= 978-0674014886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks decided at an early age that she wished to be an engineer. While her parents neither supported nor opposed Hicks' desired career path, some of her teachers and classmates tried to discourage her from becoming an engineer, viewing it as a socially unacceptable role for a woman.&lt;ref name=Current_Biography&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Hicks, Beatrice A. Jan. 2, 1919– Engineering executive |encyclopedia= Current Biography |volume= |pages= |publisher= The H. W. Wilson Company |year= 1957 |id= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Orange High School (New Jersey)|Orange High School]] in 1935 and received a [[bachelor's degree]] in chemical engineering from Newark College of Engineering (now [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]]) in 1939,&lt;ref name=Notable/&gt; one of only two women in her class.&lt;ref name=Knowing_Newark&gt;{{cite news |last= Cummings |first= Charles F. |title= Knowing Newark |newspaper= The Star-Ledger |location= Newark, NJ |date= March 9, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; During college, Hicks worked in the treasury office of an [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] store as a telephone operator, and in the university's library.&lt;ref name=Current_Biography/&gt; After receiving her undergraduate degree, Hicks stayed at Newark College of Engineering for three years as a research assistant, where she studied the history of [[Edward Weston (chemist)|Edward Weston]]'s inventions and took additional classes at night.&lt;ref name=Notable/&gt;&lt;ref name=Current_Biography/&gt;

==Career==

In 1942 Hicks took a job at the [[Western Electric|Western Electric Company]], designing and testing quartz crystal oscillators in [[Kearny, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Notable/&gt; She was the first woman to be employed by Western Electric as an engineer,&lt;ref name=Current_Biography/&gt; and she spent three years working there. Upon the death of her father, she joined the [[Bloomfield, New Jersey]] based Newark Controls Company, a metalworking firm that her father had founded. Hicks served as chief engineer and then as vice president in charge of engineering, before purchasing control of the company from her uncle in 1955. Hicks designed and patented a gas density switch later used in the U.S. space program, including the moon landing, and was a pioneer in the field of sensors that detected when devices were reaching structural limits.&lt;ref name=Notable/&gt;&lt;ref name=Knowing_Newark/&gt; Hicks authored several technical papers on the gas density switch.&lt;ref name=NAP&gt;{{cite book|last=National Academy of Engineering of the United States of America|title=Memorial tributes|year=1984|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0309034825|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Newark Controls Hicks pursued a master's degree in physics, which she received in 1949 from the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=Current_Biography/&gt;

In 1950 Hicks and other women based on the East coast of the United States began meeting in an organization, the goal of which was to advance female engineers and increase female participation in engineering. The organization was incorporated as the [[Society of Women Engineers]] two years later. Hicks served as the president of the organization for two consecutive terms, from 1950 to 1952.&lt;ref name=Notable/&gt; In 1963 the Society of Women Engineers presented their highest honor, the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, to Hicks.&lt;ref name=Notable/&gt; Hicks toured the United States, championing the cause of female engineers through outreach and speaking engagements. She believed that while female engineers would initially be closely watched, they would also be quickly accepted.&lt;ref name=Notable/&gt;&lt;ref name=Current_Biography/&gt;

In 1948 Hicks married fellow engineer Rodney Duane Chipp, who held two director level engineering positions before starting a consulting firm. In 1960 the couple were selected by the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] for a month-long research and speaking tour of South America, which focused on international cooperation between American and South American engineers.&lt;ref name=Notable/&gt; When Chipp died in 1966, Hicks sold off Newark Controls Company and took over her late husband's consulting business.&lt;ref name=Notable/&gt; Hicks was also selected to serve on the Defense Advisory Committee for Women in Services between 1960 and 1963, was the director of the First International Conference of Women Engineers and Scientists, and represented the United States at four International Management Congresses.&lt;ref name=NAP/&gt;

Hicks died on October 21, 1979 in Princeton, New Jersey.&lt;ref name=Notable/&gt;

==Awards and professional honors==

Because of her role in Newark Controls Company, ''Mademoiselle'' magazine named Hicks "Woman of the Year in Business" in 1952.&lt;ref name=Notable/&gt; In 1978 Hicks was invited to join the [[National Academy of Engineering]], the highest professional honor in engineering, and became the sixth woman to join the organization.&lt;ref name=Notable/&gt;  In 2002 Hicks was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Associated Press |title= 2002 National Women's Hall of Fame inductees |work= The Associated Press State &amp; Local Wire |date= October 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hicks received honorary doctorates from [[Hobart and William Smith College]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], and [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]. She was the first female recipient of an honorary doctorate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She was a member of both the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] and the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]].&lt;ref name=IEEE/&gt;

'''CETO''' is a [[wave energy|wave-energy]] technology that converts [[kinetic energy]] from [[ocean swell]] into electrical power and (in CETO 5) directly [[desalination|desalinates]] freshwater through [[reverse osmosis]]. The technology was developed and tested onshore and offshore in [[Fremantle]], Western Australia. In early 2015 a CETO 5 production installation was commissioned and connected to the grid. {{As of|2016|January}} all the electricity generated is being purchased to contribute towards the power requirements of [[HMAS Stirling]] naval base at [[Garden Island (Western Australia)|Garden Island]], Western Australia. Some of the energy will also be used directly to desalinate water.&lt;ref name="arena.gov.au-perth-wave-energ-2015"&gt;{{cite web
 | url =http://arena.gov.au/project/perth-wave-energy-project/
 | title =Perth Wave Energy Project
 | date =February 2015
 | website =[[Australian Renewable Energy Agency]]
 | publisher =[[Government of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]]
 | access-date =26 January 2016
 | quote =This project is the world’s first commercial-scale wave energy array that is connected to the grid and has the ability to produce desalinated water. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- both articles claim this is first grid connection of wave power in world --&gt;

CETO is designed to be a simple and robust wave technology. {{As of|2016|January}} CETO is claimed to be the only ocean-tested wave-energy technology globally that is both fully submerged and generates power and or desalinated water onshore. The CETO technology has been independently verified by [[Électricité de France|Energies Nouvelles]] (EDF EN) and the French naval contractor DCNS.&lt;ref name="carnegiewave"&gt;Carnegie Wave Energy, 2011.

==Technology==

===CETO 5===
The name is inspired by the Greek ocean goddess, [[Ceto]]. {{As of|2016|January}} the system distinguishes itself from other [[Wave power|wave-energy]] devices in being fully submerged. Submerged buoys are moved by the ocean swell, driving pumps that pressurize seawater delivered ashore by a subsea pipeline. Once onshore, the high-pressure seawater is used to drive hydro-electric turbines, generating  electricity. The high-pressure seawater can also be used to supply a [[reverse osmosis]] desalination plant, producing freshwater. Some historic conventional seawater desalination plants are large emitters of greenhouse gases; this is due to the amount of energy required to drive the grid-connected pumps that deliver the high-pressure seawater to reverse osmosis membranes for the removal of the salt.{{not in citation given|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Desalination, 2010.

===CETO 6===
{{As of|2016|January}} CETO 6 is in development, and differs from CETO 5 in having a larger buoy, with the electrical generation onboard and the power being transferred to shore by an electrical cable. The buoy is designed for deeper water and further offshore than CETO 5.&lt;ref name="CP115-0020-0"&gt;

== Commercial demonstration and independent verification of results ==
On completion of Stage 1 of the Perth Wave Energy Project, Carnegie enlisted Frazer-Nash Consultancy Ltd to verify the CETO 3 unit's measured and modelled capacity. During the CETO 3 in-ocean trial, Frazer–Nash verified the peak measured capacity to be 78&amp;nbsp;kW and delivered a sustained pressure of 77 bar, above what is required for seawater reverse-osmosis desalination.

==Projects==

=== Perth Wave Energy Project (PWEP) ===
Stage 1, already been completed, involved the manufacture, deployment and testing of a single commercial-scale autonomous CETO unit off Garden Island. For this stage, the CETO unit was not connected to shore but was stand-alone and autonomous, providing telemetric data back to shore for confirmation and independent verification of the unit's performance.

Stage 2 involved the design, construction, deployment and operational performance evaluation of a [[Electrical grid|grid-connected]] commercial-scale wave-energy demonstration project, also at Garden Island. The facility consisted of multiple submerged CETO units in an array, subsea pipeline(s) to shore, hydraulic conditioning equipment, and an onshore power generation facility.

In early 2015 a multi megawatt system was connected to the grid, with all the electricity being bought to power [[HMAS Stirling]] naval base. Two fully submerged buoys which are anchored to the [[seabed]], transmit the energy from the ocean swell through [[Hydraulics|hydraulic pressure]] onshore; to drive a generator for electricity, and also to produce fresh water. {{As of|2015}} a third buoy is planned for installation.&lt;ref name ="abc.net.au/20150218"&gt;{{cite web

=== La Réunion Wave Energy Project ===
The [[Réunion]] Island project is a joint venture between Carnegie and EDF Energies Nouvelles. The project will initially consist of the deployment of a single, autonomous commercial scale unit (stage 1) which will be followed by a 2MW plant (stage 2) and a further expansion of the project to a nominal 15MW installed capacity (stage 3). {{As of|2011|April}} stage 1 has been awarded $5M of French government funding.&lt;ref name="ecogenerationApril2011"&gt;{{cite web

A cable between a buoy and the seabed anchored hydraulic pump snapped in a CETO 4 prototype installation in January 2014. The buoy was swept away during [[Cyclone Bejisa#R.C3.A9union|Cyclone Bejisa]], which also led to a fatality and widespread damage on Réunion Island. The design was an earlier iteration than the Perth CETO 5 installation and lacked the quick release mechanism which was included in CETO 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Ireland Wave Energy Project ===
Carnegie has signed a formal funding and collaboration agreement{{When|date=July 2011}} with the Irish Government's Sustainable Energy Association (SEAI) for a €150,000 project to evaluate potential CETO wave sites in Ireland and develop a site-specific conceptual design. The project is 50% funded by the SEAI and 50% by Carnegie, and forms the first phase of detailed design for a potential 5 MW commercial demonstration project in Irish waters. The project was under way in 2011 and is being managed through Carnegie's Irish subsidiary, CETO Wave Energy Ireland Limited.&lt;ref name="carnegiewave" /&gt;

==Other wave energy and CETO characteristics==
* Wave energy is a renewable, high availability source of power.
* About 60% of the human population lives within 60&amp;nbsp;kilometers of a coastline, minimising transmission issues.{{citation needed|reason=wp:soap|date=January 2016}}
* Since water is about 800 times denser than air, the energy density of waves exceeds that of wind and solar, increasing the amount of energy available for harvesting.
* Waves are predictable in advance, making it easier to predict mismatches between supply and demand.
* CETO does not stand for ''Cylindrical Energy Transfer Oscillating'' unit – a popular misconception. The name refers to ''[[Ceto]]'', a Greek sea goddess.
* CETO sits underwater, moored to the sea floor, with minimal visual impact above the water. In practice, buoys have been fitted with warning lights on a mast above water.
* CETO units operate in deep water, away from breaking waves, meaning there is minimal impact on popular surfing sites.
* CETO units are designed to operate in harmony with the waves. This means, apart from anchor points, there is no need for massive steel and concrete support structures to be built.
* CETO units act like artificial reefs, because of the way they attract marine life.{{citation needed|reason=wp:soap|date=January 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19499">'''CMOS amplifiers''' are ubiquitous analog circuits which are used in computers, audio systems, smart phones, cameras, telecommunication systems, biomedical circuits and many other systems, and their performance has great impact on the overall specifications of the systems. They take their name from the use of [[MOSFET]] (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) as opposite to [[Bipolar Junction Transistor]]s (BJT). MOSFETS are simpler to fabricate and therefore less expensive than BJT [[amplifier]]s, still providing a sufficiently high [[transconductance]] to allow the design of very high performance circuits. In high performance [[CMOS]] amplifier circuits, [[transistor]]s are not only used to amplify the signal but are also used as [[active load]]s to achieve higher gain and output swing in comparison with resistive loads.&lt;ref name=razavi2013&gt;{{cite book |last1=Razavi |first1=Behzad |title=Fundamentals of Microelectronics |date=2013 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781118156322 |edition=2nd|url=https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-microelectronics/9781118156322/ |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sansen2006&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sansen |first1=Willy |title=Analog Design Essentials |date=2006 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-25747-1 |url=https://www.springer.com/it/book/9780387257464 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=razavi2001&gt;{{cite book |last1=Razavi |first1=Behzad |title=Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits |date=2001 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0070529038|edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMOS technology had been primarily introduced to design digital circuits. In the last decades, in order to improve speed, power consumption, required area and other aspects of digital [[integrated circuits]] (ICs), the feature size of MOSFET transistors has shrunk (minimum channel length of transistors reduces in newer CMOS technologies). This phenomenon predicted by [[Gordon Moore]] in 1975, which is called [[Moore’s law]], and states that in about each 2 years, the number of transistors doubles for the same silicon area of ICs. Progress in memory circuits design is an interesting example to see how process advancement have affected the required size and their performance in the last decades. In 1956, a 5MB [[Hard Disk Drive]] (HDD) weighted over a tone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Here's How Hard It Was to Move a 5MB IBM Hard Drive in 1956 (Note: Required a Forklift) |url=http://themindcircle.com/move-5mb-ibm-hard-drive-1956/ |website=themindcircle |accessdate=13 June 2018|date=2016-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while these days having 50000 times more capacity with a weight of several tens of grams is very common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The best USB flash drives of 2018 |url=https://www.techradar.com/news/best-usb-flash-drives |website=techradar |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While digital ICs have enormously benefited from the feature size shrinking, analog CMOS amplifiers have not gained corresponding advantages due to the intrinsic limitations imposed by an analog design, like the intrinsic gain reduction of short channel transistors which affects the overall gain of amplifier. Novel techniques to achieve higher gain also create new problems, like stability of amplifier for closed-loop applications. In the following, we will address both aspects and summarize few different methods to overcome these problems.

== Intrinsic Gain Reduction in Modern CMOS Technologies  ==

Maximum gain of a single MOSFET transistor is called intrinsic gain, and is equal to:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;  Av_{int}=gm\,ro   &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Which gm is the transconductance, and ro is the output resistance of transistor. As a first order approximation, ro is directly proportional to the channel length of transistors. In a single-stage amplifier, one can increase channel length in order to get higher output resistance and gain as well. But, it will also increase parasitic capacitance of transistor, which will limit the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of amplifier. Channel length of transistors become smaller in modern CMOS technologies, and makes achieving high gain in single-stage amplifier very challenging. In order to achieve high gain, many techniques have been suggested in the literature.&lt;ref name=mesri2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mesri |first1=Alireza |last2=Mahdipour Pirbazari |first2=Mahmoud |last3=Hadidi |first3=Khayrollah |last4=Khoei |first4=Abdollah |title=High gain two-stage amplifier with positive capacitive feedback compensation |journal=IET Circuits, Devices &amp; Systems |date=2015 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=181–190 |doi=10.1049/iet-cds.2014.0139 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7103408&amp;tag=1 |accessdate=13 June 2018|arxiv=1411.3506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mesri2015b&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mesri |first1=Alireza |last2=Mahdipour Pirbazari |first2=Mahmoud |last3=Javidan |first3=Javad |title=Analysis and design of a two-stage amplifier with enhanced performance |journal=Microelectronics Journal |date=2015 |volume=46 |issue=12–A |pages=1304–1312 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026269215002384 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TCAS1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leung |first1=Ka Nang |last2=K.

== Single-Stage Amplifiers  ==

Telescopic, Folded Cascode (FC), or Recycling FC (RFC) are the most common single stage amplifiers. All these structures use transistors as active loads in order to provide higher output resistance (= higher gain), and output swing. Telescopic amplifier, provides higher gain (due to higher output resistance) and higher bandwidth (due to smaller non-dominant pole at cascode node). In contrast, it has limited output swing and difficulty in implementation of unity-gain buffer. Although FC has lower gain and bandwidth, it can provide higher output swing which is important advantage in modern CMOS technologies, where supply voltage is reduced. Also, since the DC voltage of input and output nodes can be at the same level, it is more suitable for implementation of unity-gain buffer.&lt;ref name=razavi2001 /&gt; FC is recently used to implement [[integrator]] in a Bio-Nano sensor application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=S.

In the last decade, circuit designer have proposed different modified versions of FC circuit. RFC is one of the modified versions of FC amplifier, which provides higher gain, higher bandwidth, and also higher [[slew rate]] in comparison with FC (for the same power consumption).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=S.

=== Stability  ===

[[File:Bode plot.jpg|thumb|350px|Frequency response of a single stage-amplifier]]

In many applications, amplifier drives capacitor as a load. In some applications, like [[switched capacitor]] circuits,the value of capacitive load changes in different cycles. Therefore, it will affect [[time constant]] of output node and the [[frequency response]] of amplifier. Stable behavior of amplifier for all possible capacitive loads is necessary, and designer must consider this issue during designing of circuit. Designer should ensure that [[phase margin]] (PM) of the circuit will be enough for the worst case. In order to have proper circuit behavior and time response, designers usually consider PM of 60 degrees. for higher values of PM, circuit will be more stable, but it will take longer time for output voltage to reach its final value.&lt;ref name=razavi2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sansen2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=razavi2001 /&gt;  
In Telescopic, and FC amplifiers, dominant pole is located at the output nodes. Also, there is a non-dominant pole at cascode node.&lt;ref name=razavi2001 /&gt; Since capacitive load connected to output nodes, its value will affect the location of the dominant pole. This figure shows how capacitive load affects the location of dominant pole (W1) and stability. Increasing of capacitive load, will move dominant pole toward the origin, and since unity gain frequency (Wunity) is Av (amplifier gain) times of W1, it will also move toward the origin. Therefore, PM will increase, which improves stability. So, if we ensure stability of a circuit for a minimum capacitive load, it will remain stable for larger load values.&lt;ref name=sansen2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=razavi2001 /&gt; In order to achieve greater than 60 degrees PM, the non-dominant pole (W2) must be greater than 1.7 times of Wunity.

== Multi-Stage Amplifiers ==

In some applications, like switched capacitor filters or integrators, and different types of [[analog-to-digital converter]]s, having high gain (70-80&amp;nbsp;dB) is needed, and achieving the required gain sometimes is impossible with single-stage amplifiers.&lt;ref name=mesri2015 /&gt; This is more serious in modern CMOS technologies, which transistors have smaller output resistance due to shorter channel length. In order to achieve high gain as well as high output swing, multi-stage amplifiers have been invented. To implement two-stage amplifier, one can use FC amplifier as the first stage and a common source amplifier as the second stage. Also, to implement four-stage amplifier, 3 common source amplifier can be cascaded with FC amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grasso |first1=Alfio Dario |last2=Palumbo |first2=Gaetano |last3=Salvatore |first3=Pennisi |title=High-Performance Four-Stage CMOS OTA Suitable for Large Capacitive Loads |journal=IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems—I: Regular Papers |date=2015 |volume=62 |issue=10 |pages=2476–2484 |doi=10.1109/TCSI.2015.2476298 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7277177/ |accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be mentioned that to drive large capacitive loads or small resistive loads, the output stage should be class AB.&lt;ref name=sansen2006 /&gt; For example, common source amplifier with class AB behavior can be used as the final stage in three-stage amplifier to not only improve drive capability, but also gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cabrera-Bernal |first1=Elena |last2=Pennisi |first2=Salvatore |last3=Dario Grasso |first3=Alfio |last4=Torralba |first4=Antonio |last5=Gonzalez Carvajal |first5=Ramón |title=0.7-V Three-Stage Class-AB CMOS Operational Transconductance Amplifier |journal=IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems—I: Regular Papers |date=2016 |volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1807–1815 |doi=10.1109/TCSI.2016.2597440 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7556409/ |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Class AB amplifier can be used as a column  driver in [[LCD]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grasso |first1=A.D. |last2=Palumbo |first2=G. |last3=Pennisi |first3=S. |title=Dual push-pull high-speed rail-to-rail CMOS buffer amplifier for flat-panel displays |journal=IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs |pages=1 |date=2018 |doi=10.1109/TCSII.2018.2817261 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8320304/ |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stability in Two-Stage Amplifiers ===

Unlike single-stage amplifiers, multi-stage amplifiers usually have 3 or more poles and if they used in feedback networks, the closed loop system will probably unstable. In order to have stable behavior in multi-stage amplifiers, it is necessary to use compensation network. The main goal of compensation network is to modify transfer function of the system in such a way to achieve enough PM.&lt;ref name=sansen2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=razavi2001 /&gt; So, by the use of compensation network, we should get frequency response similar to what we showed for single-stage amplifiers.  
In single-stage amplifiers, capacitive load is connected to output node which dominant pole happens there, and increasing its value improves PM.&lt;ref name=razavi2001 /&gt; So, it acts like a compensation capacitor (network). To compensate multi-stage amplifiers, compensation capacitor is usually used to move dominant pole to lower frequency in order to achieve enough PM.   
[[File:Block diagram of two-stage amplifiers.jpg|thumb|250px|Block diagram of fully differential and single-ended two-stage amplifiers]]
The following figure shows the block diagram of a two-stage amplifier in fully differential and single ended modes. In a two-stage amplifier, input stage can be a Telescopic or FC amplifier. For the second stage, common source amplifier with active load is a common choice. Since output resistance of the first stage is much greater than the second stage, dominant pole is at the output of the first stage. Without compensation, the amplifier is unstable or at least it does not have enough PM. It is important to mention that the load capacitance will be connected to the output of the second stage, which non-dominant pole happens there. Therefore, unlike single-stage amplifiers, increasing of capacitive load, will move non-dominant pole to lower frequency and will deteriorate PM.&lt;ref name=razavi2001 /&gt; Mesri et al. suggested two-stage amplifiers which behave like single-stage amplifiers, and amplifiers remains stable for larger values of capacitive loads.&lt;ref name=mesri2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=mesri2015b /&gt;
To have proper behavior, we need to compensate two-stage or multi-stage amplifiers. The simplest way for compensation of two-stage amplifier, as shown in the left block diagram of the below figure, is to connect compensation capacitor at the output of the first stage, and move dominant pole to lower frequencies. But, realization of capacitor on silicon chip requires considerable area. The most common compensation method in two-stage amplifiers is Miller compensation (middle block diagram in the below figure.&lt;ref name=sansen2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=razavi2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TCAS1 /&gt; In this method, a compensation capacitor is placed between input and output node of the second stage. In this case, the compensation capacitor will appear 1+|Av2| times greater at the output of the first stage, and will push the dominant pole as well as unity gain frequency to lower frequencies. Moreover, because of [[pole splitting]] effect, it will also move the non-dominant pole to higher frequencies. Therefore, it is a good candidate to make the amplifier stable. The main advantage of Miller compensation method, is to reduce size of the required compensation capacitor by a factor of 1+|Av2|. The issue raised from Miller compensation capacitor is introducing right-half plane (RHP) zero, which reduces PM. Hopefully, different methods have suggested to solve this issue. As an example, to cancel the effect of RHP zero, nulling resistor can be used in series with compensation capacitor (right block diagram of the below figure). Based on the resistor value, we can push RHP zero to higher frequency (in order to cancel its effect on PM), or to move it LHP (in order to improve PM), or even remove the first non-dominant pole to improve Bandwidth and PM. This method of compensation is recently used in amplifier design for potentiostat circuit.&lt;ref name=TCAS1a /&gt; Because of process variation, resistor value can change more than 10%, and therefore affects stability. Using current buffer or voltage buffer in series with compensation capacitor is another option to get better results.&lt;ref name=sansen2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=razavi2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TCAS1 /&gt;

The '''Chebyshev's Lambda Mechanism'''&lt;ref name="Wolfram"&gt;http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ChebyshevsLambdaMechanism/&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[four-bar mechanism]] that converts rotational motion to approximate [[straight-line motion]] with approximate constant velocity.&lt;ref name=DOM&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.designofmachinery.com/DOM/ |title=Design of Machinery |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise design trades off straightness, lack of acceleration, and the proportion of the driving rotation that is spent in the linear portion of the full curve.&lt;ref name=DOM134&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.designofmachinery.com/DOM/Chap_03_3ed_p134.pdf |title=DOM p134 Hoecken linkage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The example to the right spends over half of the cycle in the near straight portion.

The Chebyshev's Lambda Mechanism is a [[cognate linkage]] of the [[Chebyshev linkage]].

The linkage was first shown in Paris on the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)]] as "The Plantigrade Machine".&lt;ref&gt;http://mech.spbstu.ru/Dzenushko_Dainis:_Walking_mechanisms_survey#The_Chebyshev_Walking_Mechanism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etudes.ru/en/etudes/stopohod/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129015429/http://www.etudes.ru/en/etudes/stopohod/ |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chebyshev's Lambda Mechanism looks like the Greek letter lambda, therefore the linkage is also known as Lambda Mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etudes.ru/en/etudes/stopohod/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129015429/http://www.etudes.ru/en/etudes/stopohod/ |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clonk''' is a [[fishing]] tool which has been used in [[Europe]] to fish for [[Wels catfish]]. It consists of a stick with three parts: handle, fork and heel. Originally it was made of [[wood]] but nowadays there are clonks made of [[plastic]] or [[metal]] too because they are easier to produce than wood.

The process of clonking may look an easy job at first, but it requires some practice. The air bubble produced when the clonk strikes the water is cut by the fork and this produces a unique sound similar to opening a [[wine bottle]]. This sound stimulates the defensive instinct in nearby catfish and they attack the "intruder", which in this case is the bait.

A '''cooling vest''' is a piece of specially made clothing designed to lower or stabilize body temperature and make exposure to warm climates or environments more bearable. Cooling vests are used by many athletes, construction workers, and welders, as well as individuals suffering from [[multiple sclerosis]], [[hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia]], or various types of [[sports injuries]].

==Types ==
Cooling vests range in weight from around two to eight pounds, depending on the model. While many sub-types do exist, cooling vests fall into one of 5 primary types:

*Evaporative cooling vests are typically submersed in water for around 3 – 5 minutes and lightly wrung out or blot dried. They are usually worn outside the clothing and as the water in the vest interacts with specially treated cooling crystals or other cooling agents, the water evaporates which then causes body temperature to be reduced. They are light weight, easy to use and no electricity is required making them perfect for people on the move. They are also the most affordable form of cooling vest.
*Ice chilled cooling vests make use of cooling energy packs that are activated inside of a freezer and then placed in pockets inside of the cooling vest. Because they are very cold to the touch, this type of cooling vest is always worn outside the clothes. 
*A phase change cooling vest makes use of cooling packs that maintain much higher temperatures when refrigerated, frozen, or placed in water. These phase-change packs often contain liquids (typically nontoxic oils and fats) that solidify (like wax) typically between 55 and 65 degrees and usually last between 1.5 – 4 hours. This flexible cooled pack will then help reduce the wearers’ temperature for up to 4 hours.
*A cool flow cooling vest makes use of a water flow system that pumps water through the vest using hoses.
*Thermoelectric cooling vest works on peltier effect and cools down the inner surface of the vest. It is powered by a portable battery.

== Uses ==
The effects of cooling vests on [[athlete]]s to improve their performance has been evaluated on several occasions; at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] several Americans and Australians were fitted with cooling vests supplied by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and Arctic Heat 2004,2008,2012,2016 Olympics, used prior to their events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warming Up With an Ice Vest: Core Body Temperature Before and After Cross-Country Racing|pmc=1748408|publisher=NATA Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooling vests are also used by persons with [[multiple sclerosis]]. In multiple sclerosis, nerve fibers become demyelinated which leads to pain and discomfort when temperature is elevated. Nerve fibers may also be remyelinating or in the process of repairing themselves and still be sensitive to elevated temperatures. The cooling vest keeps the patient's temperature down, reducing the pain symptoms. In 2005, a 12-week study at the [[University of Buffalo]] was funded by the [[National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research]], a division of the [[U.S. Department of Education]], to determine if people with multiple sclerosis could exercise longer with the help of a cooling vest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/news/fast-execute.cgi/article-page.html?article=76110009 |title=Can Cooling Affect Exercise for Those with MS? - UB NewsCenter |publisher=Buffalo.edu |date=2005-10-31 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copper(I) acetylide''', or '''cuprous acetylide''', is a [[chemical compound]] with the formula [[copper|Cu]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Although never characterized by [[X-ray crystallography]], the material has been claimed at least since 1856.&lt;ref name=cataldo/&gt; One form is claimed to be a mono[[hydrate]] with formula {{chem|Cu|2|C|2}}.{{chem|H|2|O}}).  It is a reddish solid, that easily explodes when dry.

== Synthesis ==
Materials purported to be copper acetylide can be prepared by treating [[acetylene]] with a solution of [[copper(I) chloride]] and [[ammonia]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 CuCl → Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl
This reaction produces a reddish solid [[precipitate]].

== Properties ==
When dry, copper acetylide is a heat and shock sensitive [[high explosive]], more thermally sensitive than [[silver acetylide]].&lt;ref name="CataldoCasari2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cataldo|first1=Franco|last2=Casari|first2=Carlo S.|title=Synthesis, Structure and Thermal Properties of Copper and Silver Polyynides and Acetylides|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Organometallic Polymers and Materials|volume=17|issue=4|year=2007|pages=641–651|issn=1574-1443|doi=10.1007/s10904-007-9150-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper acetylide is thought to form inside pipes made of [[copper]] or an alloy with high copper content, which may result in violent explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.msha.gov/Accident_Prevention/Tips/acetylenegas.htm |title = Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) - Accident Prevention Program - Miner's Tips - Hazards of Acetylene Gas |accessdate = 2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was found to be the cause of explosions in acetylene plants, and led to abandonment of copper as a construction material in such plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/encyclopedia/?print&amp;nd=857200158 |accessdate=February 8, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001010729/http://www.ilo.org/encyclopedia/?print&amp;nd=857200158 |archivedate=October 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper [[catalyst]]s used in [[petrochemistry]] can also possess a degree of risk under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://aiche.confex.com/aiche/s06/preliminaryprogram/abstract_43768.htm |title = The Safe Use of Copper -Containing Catalysts in Ethylene Plants |accessdate = 2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
Copper acetylide is the substrate of [[Glaser coupling]] for the formation of [[polyyne]]s.  In a typical reaction, a suspension of {{chem|Cu|2|C|2}}.{{chem|H|2|O}} in an [[ammonium|amoniacal]] solution is treated with air.  The copper is [[oxidized]] to {{chem|Cu|2+}} and forms a blue soluble [[coordination compound|complex]] with the [[ammonia]], leaving behind a black solid residue.  The latter has been claimed to consist of [[linear acetylenic carbon|carbyne]], an elusive [[allotrope]] of carbon:&lt;ref name=cataldo2&gt;Franco Cataldo (1999), ' 'A study on the structure and electrical properties of the fourth carbon allotrope: carbyne''. Polymer International, volume 44, issue 2, pages 191–200. {{doi|10.1002/(SICI)1097-0126(199710)44:2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
:  {{chem|Cu|+}} &lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;C(≡C−C≡)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{chem|Cu|+}}
This interpretation has been disputed.&lt;ref name=kroto&gt; H. Kroto (2010), [http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2010/November/CarbyneOtherMythsAboutCarbon.asp ''Carbyne and other myths about carbon'']. RSC Chemistry World, November 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Freshly prepared copper acetylide reacts with [[hydrochloric acid]] to form acetylene and copper(I) chloride.  Samples that have been aged with exposure to air or to copper(II) ions liberate also higher [[polyyne]]s H(−C≡C−)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H, with ''n'' from 2 to 6, when decomposed by [[hydrochloric acid]]. A "carbonaceous" residue of this decomposition also has the spectral signature of (−C≡C−)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; chains.  It has been conjectured that oxidation causes polymerization of the [[acetylide]] anions {{chem|C|2|2-}} in the solid into [[linear acetylenic carbon|carbyne]]-type anions .C(≡C−C≡)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; or [[cumulene|polycumulene]]-type anions C(=C=C=)&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=cataldo&gt; Franco Cataldo (1999), ''From dicopper acetylide to carbyne''.Polymer International, volume 48, issue 1, pages 15-22. {{doi|10.1002/(SICI)1097-0126(199901)48:1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal decomposition of copper acetylide in vacuum is not explosive and leaves copper as a fine powder at the bottom of the flask, while depositing a fluffy very fine carbon powder on the walls. On the basis of spectral data, this powder was claimed to be [[linear acetylenic carbon|carbyne]] C(−C≡C−)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;C rather than graphite as expected.&lt;ref name=cataldo/&gt;

==Applications==
Though not practically useful as an explosive due to high sensitivity and reactivity towards water{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, it is interesting as a curiosity because it is one of the very few explosives that do not liberate any gaseous products upon detonation.

The formation of copper acetylide when a gas is passed through a solution of copper(I) chloride is used as a test for the presence of acetylene.

Reactions between Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and alkynes occur only if a terminal hydrogen is present (as it is slightly acidic in nature). Thus, this reaction is used for identification of terminal alkynes.

[[File:Electronic lock yl88 operation.ogg|thumb|A quick demonstration of an electronic door lock]]
An '''electronic lock''' (or '''electric lock''') is a [[Lock (security device)|locking device]] which operates by means of electric current. Electric locks are sometimes stand-alone with an electronic control assembly mounted directly to the lock. Electric locks may be connected to an [[access control]] system, the advantages of which include: key control, where keys can be added and removed without re-keying the lock cylinder; fine access control, where time and place are factors; and transaction logging, where activity is recorded. Electronic locks can also be remotely monitored and controlled, both to lock and to unlock.

==Operation==
Electric locks use magnets, [[solenoid]]s, or motors to actuate the lock by either supplying or removing power. Operating the lock can be as simple as using a switch, for example an apartment intercom door release, or as complex as a [[biometric]] based [[access control]] system.

There are two basic types of locks: "preventing mechanism" or operation mechanism.{{elucidate|date=March 2016}}

==Types==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
[[File:La Gard 3740M Dead Bolt Electronic Digital Lock.JPG|thumb|A deadbolt electronic lock mounted in a home safe]]

=== Electromagnetic lock ===
The most basic type of electronic lock is a [[magnetic lock]] (informally called a "mag lock"). A large electro-magnet is mounted on the door frame and a corresponding armature is mounted on the door. When the magnet is powered and the door is closed, the armature is held fast to the magnet. Mag locks are simple to install and are very attack-resistant. One drawback is that improperly installed or maintained mag locks can fall on people,{{dubious|date=March 2016}} and also that one must unlock the mag lock to both enter and to leave. This has caused [[fire marshal]]s to impose [[fire code|strict rules]] on the use of mag locks and access control practice in general. Additionally, [[National Fire Protection Agency|NFPA]] 101 (Standard for Life Safety and Security), as well as the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] (Americans with Disability Act) require "no prior knowledge" and "one simple movement" to allow "free egress". This means that in an emergency, a person must be able to move to a door and immediately exit with one motion (requiring no push buttons, having another person unlock the door, reading a sign, or "special knowledge").

Other problems include a [[lag|lag time]] (delay), because the collapsing [[magnetic field]] holding the door shut does not release instantaneously. This lag time can cause a user to collide with the still-locked door. Finally, mag locks fail unlocked, in other words, if electrical power is removed they unlock. This could be a problem where security is a primary concern. Additionally, power outages could affect mag locks installed on [[fire door|fire listed doors]], which are required to remain latched at all times except when personnel are passing through. Most mag lock designs would not meet current fire codes as the primary means of securing a fire listed door to a frame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfpa.org/ NFPA] 80, Standard for Fire Doors, Frames and Other Opening Protectives, Section 5.2.4&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, many commercial doors (this typically does not apply to private residences) are moving over to stand-alone locks, or electric locks installed under a [[Certified Personnel Program]].{{elucidate|date=March 2016}} 

The first mechanical recodable card lock was invented in 1976 by [[Tor Sørnes]], who had worked for [[VingCard]] since the 1950s. The first card lock order was shipped in 1979 to [[Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel]], Atlanta, US. This product triggered the evolution of electronic locks for the hospitality industry.{{elucidate|date=March 2016}}

=== Electronic strikes ===
Electric strikes (also called electric latch release) replace a standard strike mounted on the door frame and receive the [[Latch (hardware)|latch]] and latch bolt. Electric strikes can be simplest to install when they are designed for one-for-one drop-in replacement of a standard strike, but some electric strike designs require that the door frame be heavily modified. Installation of a strike into a fire listed door (for open backed strikes on pairs of doors) or the frame must be done under listing agency authority, if any modifications to the frame are required (mostly for commercial doors and frames). In the US, since there is no current Certified Personnel Program to allow field installation of electric strikes into fire listed door openings, listing agency field evaluations would most likely require the door and frame to be de-listed and replaced. 

Electric strikes can allow mechanical free egress: a departing person operates the [[lockset]] in the door, not the electric strike in the door frame. Electric strikes can also be either "fail unlocked" (except in Fire Listed Doors, as they must remain latched when power is not present), or the more-secure "fail locked" design. Electric strikes are easier to attack than a mag lock. It is simple to lever the door open at the strike, as often there is an increased gap between the strike and the door latch. [[Latch guard]] plates are often used to cover this gap.

=== Electronic deadbolts and latches ===
Electric mortise and cylindrical locks are drop-in replacements for door-mounted mechanical locks. An additional hole must be drilled in the door for electric power wires. Also, a power transfer hinge is often used to get the power from the door frame to the door. Electric mortise and cylindrical locks allow mechanical free egress, and can be either fail unlocked or fail locked. In the US, UL rated doors must retain their rating: in new construction doors are cored and then rated. but in retrofits, the doors must be re-rated.

Electrified exit hardware, sometimes called "panic hardware" or "[[crash bar]]s", are used in fire exit applications. A person wishing to exit pushes against the bar to open the door, making it the easiest of mechanically-free exit methods. Electrified exit hardware can be either fail unlocked or fail locked. A drawback of electrified exit hardware is their complexity, which requires skill to install and maintenance to assure proper function. Only hardware labeled "Fire Exit Hardware" can be installed on fire listed doors and frames and must meet both panic exit listing standards and fire listing standards.

Motor-operated locks are used throughout Europe. A European motor-operated lock has two modes, day mode where only the latch is electrically operated, and night mode where the more secure [[Dead bolt|deadbolt]] is electrically operated.

In South Korea, most homes and apartments have installed electronic locks, which are currently{{when|date=March 2016}} replacing the lock systems in older homes. South Korea mainly uses a lock system by Gateman.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

==Authentication methods==
[[File:Digicode.JPG|thumb|upright|Simple PIN electronic lock securing an elevator]]
[[File:Gateman-sb740.jpg|thumb|upright|A biometric electronic lock with PIN entry]]
A feature of electronic locks is that the locks can deactivated or opened by [[authentication]], without the use of a traditional physical [[key (lock)|key]]: 

=== Numerical codes, passwords, and passphrases ===
Perhaps the most common form of electronic lock uses a keypad to enter a numerical code or [[password]] for authentication. Such locks typically provide, and some feature an audible response to each press. Combination lengths are usually between 4 and 6 digits long.

===Security tokens===
Another means of authenticating users is to require them to scan or "swipe" a [[security token]] such as a [[smart card]] or similar, or to interact a token with the lock. For example, some locks can access stored credentials on a [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) or smartphone, by using [[infrared]],  [[Bluetooth]], or [[Near field communication|NFC]] data transfer methods.

===Biometrics===
As [[biometrics]] become more and more prominent as a recognized means of positive identification, their use in security systems increases. Some electronic locks take advantage of technologies such as [[fingerprint]] scanning, [[retinal scan]]ning, iris scanning and [[Speaker recognition|voice print]] identification to authenticate users.

===RFID===
[[Radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) is the use of an object (typically referred to as an "RFID tag") applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader. This technology is also used in some modern electronic locks.

EO pumps are compact, have no moving parts, and scale favorably with fuel cell design. The EO pump might drop the [[parasitic load]] of water management in fuel cells from 20% to 0.5% of the fuel cell power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsti.org/BioNano2007/showabstract.html?absno=3149 Parasitic load in fuel cells]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glitch removal''' is the elimination of [[Glitch#Electronics glitches|glitch]]es{{emdash}}unnecessary signal transitions without functionality{{emdash}}from electronic circuits. [[Power dissipation]] of a gate occurs in two ways: static power dissipation and dynamic power dissipation. Glitch power comes under dynamic dissipation in the circuit and is directly proportional to switching activity. Glitch power dissipation is 20%-70% of total power dissipation and hence glitching should be eliminated for low power design.

Switching activity occurs due to [[signal transition]]s which are of two types: functional transition and a [[glitch]]. [[Switching power]] dissipation is directly proportional to the switching activity (α), load [[capacitance]] (C), Supply voltage (V), and [[clock frequency]] (''f'') as:

: P = α·C·V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·''f'' 

Switching activity means transition to different levels. Glitches are dependent on signal transitions and more glitches results in higher power dissipation. As per above equation switching power dissipation can be controlled by controlling switching activity (α), [[voltage scaling]] etc.

== Glitch reduction techniques ==

=== Reducing switching activity ===

As discussed, more transition results in more glitches and hence more power dissipation. To minimize glitch occurrence, switching activity should be minimized. For example, [[Gray code]] could be used in counters instead of [[binary code]], since every increment in Gray code only flips one bit.  
=== Gate freezing ===

Gate freezing minimizes power dissipation by eliminating glitching. It relies on the availability of modified [[Standard cell#Library|standard library cells]] such as the so-called '''F-Gate'''. This method consists of transforming high glitch gates into modified devices which filter out the glitches when a control signal is applied. When the control signal is high, the F-Gate operates as normal but when the control signal is low, the gate output is disconnected from the ground. As a result it can never be discharged to logic 0 and glitches are prevented.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Modified library cell, the "F-Gate".JPG|thumb|center|Modified library cell, The F-Gate]] --&gt;

=== Hazard filtering and balanced path delay ===
[[File:Balanced path delay2.JPG|thumb|right|Balanced path delay technique]]
[[Hazard (logic)|Hazard]]s in digital circuits are unnecessary transitions due to varying path delays in the circuit. Balanced path delay techniques can be used for resolving differing path delays. To make path delays equal, buffer insertion is done on the faster paths. Balanced path delay will avoid glitches in the output.

Hazard filtering is another way to remove glitching. In hazard filtering [[Logic gate|gate]] propagation delays are adjusted. This results in balancing all path delays at the output.

Hazard filtering is preferred over path balancing as path balancing consumes more power due to the insertion of additional buffers.

=== Gate sizing ===
Gate upsizing and gate downsizing techniques are used for path balancing. A gate is replaced by a logically equivalent but differently-sized cell so that delay of the gate is changed. Because increasing the gate size also increases power dissipation, gate-upsizing is only used when power saved by glitch removal is more than the power dissipation due to the increase in size. Gate sizing affects glitching transitions but does not affect the functional transition.

=== Multiple threshold transistor ===

The delay of a gate is a function of its [[threshold voltage]]. Non-critical paths are selected and threshold voltage of the gates in these paths is increased. This results in balanced propagation delay along different paths converging at the receiving gate. Performance is maintained since it is determined by the time required by the critical path. A higher threshold voltage also reduces the [[leakage current]] of a path.

== Biography ==
Born and raised in [[Hamburg]], Johannsen received his [[Dipl.-Ing.]] in communication and information engineering from the [[Technical University of Berlin]] in 1967, where in 1971 he also received his [[Dr.-Ing.]] in flight guidance and manual control. He studied Sound Engineering at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]] for another three years, and received his [[habilitation]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="GJ Bio"&gt;[http://www.gunnar-johannsen.de/biograph.html Gunnar Johannsen, Professor em.

In 1971 Johannsen started his academic career as division head at the Research Institute for Human Engineering (FGAN-FAT) in [[Wachtberg]], south of [[Bonn]]. After his habilitation in 1980 he became [[privatdozent]] in the field of human-machine systems at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the [[RWTH Aachen University]]. In 1982 he moved to the [[University of Kassel]], where he was appointed Professor of Systems Engineering and Human-Machine Systems until his retirement in 2006. Over the years Johannsen was visiting Scholar at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1977−78, at the [[Kyoto Institute of Technology]] in 1995 and 2004; at the [[Vienna University of Technology]] in 1999; and at the [[University of British Columbia]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="GJ Bio"/&gt;

Johannsen was fellow of the [[International Federation of Automatic Control]], where in 1981 he founded the working Group on Man-Machine Systems, and served in different positions over the years. In 1995 he was awarded the Japanese-German Research Award by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. In 2001 he was elected [[Fellow of the IEEE]]. In 2005 the [[University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambresis]] awarded him an [[Docteur Honoris Causa]], and in 2007 the [[Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology]] nominated him for the 2007 Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science on Human-Centered Computing.&lt;ref name="GJ Bio"/&gt;

== Work ==
=== Graphical intelligent dialogues ===
In 1986, Jim Alty's HCI group at [[The Turing Institute]] won a major [[European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology]] 1 contract to investigate the use of Knowledge Based systems in Process Control Interfaces called GRADIENT (Graphical Intelligent Dialogues, P600).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Project Synopses Advanced Information Processing|year=1988| series= European Strategic Programme for Research and Development in Information Technology |publisher= Directorate General XIll Telecommunications, Information Industries and Innovation Commission of the European Communities |volume=4| pages=38–39|url= http://www.cordis.lu/esprit/src/projects.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Gunnar Johannsen of Kassel University, Peter Elzer of the [[Clausthal University of Technology]] and [[Asea Brown Boveri]] to create intelligent interfaces for process control operators.

This work had a major impact on process control interface design. The initial pilot phase report (Alty, Elzer et al., 1985) was widely used and cited.

'''Hu Zhengyan''' ({{zh|s=胡正言}}; {{circa}} 1584{{spaced ndash}}1674) was a Chinese artist, printmaker and publisher. He worked in [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Chinese painting|traditional Chinese painting]], and [[Seal (East Asia)|seal-carving]], but was primarily a publisher, producing academic texts as well as records of his own work.

Hu lived in [[Nanjing]] during the transition from the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Qing dynasty]]. A Ming loyalist, he was offered a position at the rump court of the [[Hongguang Emperor]], but declined the post, and never held anything more than minor political office. He did, however, design the Hongguang Emperor's personal [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]], and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor's capture and death in 1645. He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten Bamboo Studio, in which he practised various [[Color printing#China|multi-colour printing]] and [[Paper embossing|embossing]] techniques, and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise. Hu's work at the Ten Bamboo Studio pioneered new techniques in colour printmaking, leading to delicate gradations of colour which were not previously achievable in this art form.

Hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled ''The Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy'', an artist's primer which remained in print for around 200 years. His studio also published seal catalogues, academic and medical texts, books on poetry, and decorative writing papers. Many of these were edited and prefaced by Hu and his brothers.

==Biography==
[[File:Former Residence of Hu Zhengyan 03 2015-05.JPG|thumb|150px|alt=Front facade of Hu's former residence in Xiuning|Hu's former residence in Xiuning]]
Hu was born in [[Xiuning County]], [[Anhui Province]] in 1584 or early 1585.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = Hu Zhengyan: Fashioning Biography | journal = Ars Orientalis | volume = 35 | issue =  | pages = 129–154 | publisher = The Smithsonian Institution | jstor = 25481910 | doi = 10.2307/25481910 | url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25481910?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102265991591 | format =  | accessdate = 29 May 2013 | last=Wright | first=Suzanne E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both his father and elder brother Zhengxin ({{zh|t=正心|labels=no}}, [[art name]] Wusuo, {{zh|t=無所|labels=no}}) were physicians, and after he turned 30 he travelled with them while they practised medicine in the areas around [[Lu'an]] and [[Huoshan County|Huoshan]].&lt;ref name=SunShaobin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gallery.zhuokearts.com/gallery/jgview.aspx?id=50181 |title=十竹斋 |trans-title=Ten Bamboo Studio |last=Sun Shaobin |publisher=ZhuoKeArts.com |accessdate=26 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701095155/http://gallery.zhuokearts.com/gallery/jgview.aspx?id=50181 |archivedate=1 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly stated that Zhengyan himself was also a doctor,&lt;ref name=SunShaobin/&gt; though the earliest sources attesting to this occur only in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

By 1619, Hu had moved to Nanjing&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt; where he lived with his wife Wu.&lt;ref name="Lu2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lu|first=Yongxiang|title=A History of Chinese Science and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d__HBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206|date=10 October 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-662-44166-4|pages=205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their home on Jilongshan ({{zh|t=雞籠山|labels=no}}, now also known as [[Beiji Ge]]), a hill located just within the northern [[City Wall of Nanjing|city wall]],&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt; served as a meeting-house for like-minded artists. Hu named it the Ten Bamboo Studio (''Shizhuzhai'', {{zh|t=十竹齋|labels=no}}), after the ten bamboo plants that grew in front of the property.&lt;ref name="Lu2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rawson&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Jessica Rawson|Rawson, J.]]|title=The British Museum book of Chinese Art|year=2007|publisher=The British Museum Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-7141-2446-9|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/h/hu_zhengyan,_shizhuzhai_shuhua.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020234350/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/h/hu_zhengyan,_shizhuzhai_shuhua.aspx|archivedate=2015-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It functioned as the headquarters for his printing business, where he employed ten artisans including his two brothers Zhengxin and Zhengxing ({{zh|t=正行|labels=no}}, art name Zizhu, {{zh|t=子著|labels=no}}) and his sons Qipu ({{zh|t=其樸|labels=no}}) and Qiyi ({{zh|t=其毅|labels=no}}, courtesy name {{zh|t=致果|labels=no}}).&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

During Hu's lifetime, the [[Ming dynasty]], which had ruled China for over 250 years, was [[Qing conquest of the Ming|overthrown and replaced]] by China's last imperial dynasty, the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]]. Following the fall of the capital [[Beijing]] in 1644, remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a [[Southern Ming|Ming loyalist regime]] in [[Nanjing]] with [[Zhu Yousong]] on the throne as the Hongguang Emperor.&lt;ref name="TwitchettFairbank1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Twitchett|first1=Denis Crispin|last2=Fairbank|first2=John King|title=The Cambridge History of China: The Ming dynasty, 1368–1644, Part 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyhT9SZRLS8C&amp;pg=PA641|accessdate=31 May 2013|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-24332-2|page=642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hu, who was noted for his seal-carving and facility with [[seal script]],  created a [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] for the new Emperor. The court offered him the position of Drafter for the Secretariat (''zhongshu sheren'', {{zh|t=中書舍人|labels=no}}) as a reward, but he did not accept the role (although he did accord himself the title of ''zhongshu sheren'' in some of his subsequent personal seals).&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

According to Wen Ruilin's ''Lost History of the South'' (''Nanjiang Yishi'', {{zh|t=南疆繹史|labels=no}}), prior to the [[Qing conquest of the Ming#Jiangnan|Qing invasion of Nanjing]] Hu studied at [[Nanjing University|the National University]] there, and whilst a student was employed by the [[Ministry of Rites]] to record official proclamations; he produced the ''Imperial Promotion of Minor Learning'' (''Qin Ban Xiaoxue'', {{zh|t=御頒小學|labels=no}}) and the ''Record of Displayed Loyalty'' (''Biaozhong Ji'', {{zh|t=表忠記|labels=no}}) as part of this work. As a result, he was promoted to the Ministry of Personnel and gained admittance to the [[Hanlin Academy]], but before he could take up this appointment, Beijing had fallen to the [[Manchu]] rebellion.&lt;ref name="温睿臨1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=温睿臨|title=南疆逸史|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23bTAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=31 May 2013|year=1971|publisher=崇文書店|pages=306–307|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since contemporaneous biographies (Wen's work was not published until 1830) make no mention of these events, it has been suggested that they were fabricated after Hu's death.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

Hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in 1646, after the end of the Ming dynasty.&lt;ref name="杜濬1894"/&gt; [[Xiao Yuncong]] and [[Lü Liuliang]] recorded visiting him during his later years, in 1667 and 1673 respectively.&lt;ref name=SunShaobin/&gt; He died in poverty at the age of 90, sometime around late 1673 or early 1674.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

==Seal-carving==
[[File:Hu Zhengyan Seal Comp.jpg|thumb|left|150px|alt=Six Chinese seal impressions|Examples of Hu Zhengyan's seal carving]]
Hu Zhengyan was a noted seal-carver, producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries. His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the [[Han dynasty]], and he followed the [[Huizhou (region)|Huizhou]] school of carving founded by his contemporary [[He Zhen (artist)|He Zhen]]. Hu's calligraphy, although balanced and with a clear compositional structure, is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed. Huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient, weathered impression, although unlike other Huizhou artists Hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

Hu's work was known outside his local area.  [[Zhou Lianggong]], a poet who lived in Nanjing around the same time as Hu and was a noted art connoisseur, stated in his ''Biography of Seal-Carvers'' (''Yinren Zhuan'', {{zh|t=印人傳|labels=no}}) that Hu "creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=印人传|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82FkuAAACAAJ|accessdate=3 June 2013|year=2000|publisher=海南出版社|isbn=978-7-80645-663-7|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through Nanjing.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wright2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Suzanne E.|title="Luoxuan biangu jianpu" and "Shizhuzhai jianpu": Two Late-Ming Catalogues of Letter Paper Designs|journal=Artibus Asiae|date=2003|volume=63|issue=1|pages=69–115|jstor=3249694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1644, Hu took it upon himself to create a new [[Heirloom Seal of the Realm|Imperial seal]] for the Hongguang Emperor, which he carved after a period of fasting and prayer. He presented his creation with an essay, the ''Great Exhortation of the Seal'' (''Dabao Zhen'', {{zh|t=大寶箴|labels=no}}), in which he bemoaned the loss of the [[Chongzhen Emperor]]'s seal and begged Heaven's favour in restoring it. Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming, equally-footed couplets (''pianti'', {{zh|t=駢體|labels=no}}) used in the [[Imperial examination]]s, but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the Southern Ming court.&lt;ref name="杜濬1894"&gt;{{cite book|last=杜濬|title=變雅堂遺集|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVXmAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=31 May 2013|year=1894|publisher=上海古籍出版社|pages=18–20|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his reputation as an artist and seal-carver, Hu was primarily a publisher. His publishing house, the Ten Bamboo Studio, produced reference works on calligraphy, poetry and art; medical textbooks; books on etymology and phonetics; and copies of as well as commentaries on the [[Four Books and Five Classics#Four Books|Confucian Classics]]. Unlike other publishers in the area, the Ten Bamboo Studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels.&lt;ref name="BrokawChow2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brokaw|first1=Cynthia J.|last2=Chow|first2=Kai-Wing|title=Printing and book culture in late Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2DjFx_RbjkC&amp;pg=PA131|accessdate=29 May 2013|year=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23126-9|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio's location: the mountain on which Hu took up residence was just to the north of the Nanjing [[Guozijian]] (National Academy), which provided a captive market for academic texts.&lt;ref name="馬孟晶1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=馬孟晶|title=晚明金陵"十竹齋書畫譜""十竹齋箋譜"硏究|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpLzSAAACAAJ|accessdate=3 June 2013|year=1993|publisher=National Taiwan University Dept. of Art History|pages=29–30|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1627 and 1644, the Ten Bamboo Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind, aimed at a wealthy, literary audience.&lt;ref name="Chow2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chow|first=Kai-Wing|title=Publishing, culture, and power in early modern China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-_l3tDB47AC&amp;pg=PA84|accessdate=29 May 2013|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-3368-7|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio's earliest publications were medical textbooks, the first of which, ''Tested Prescriptions for Myriad Illnesses'' (''Wanbing Yanfang'', {{zh|t=萬病驗方|labels=no}}) was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later. Hu's brother Zhengxin was a medical practitioner and appears to have been the author of these books.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

During the 1630s the Ten Bamboo Studio also produced political works extolling the rule of the Ming; these included the ''Imperial Ming Record of Loyalty'' (''Huang Ming Biaozhong Ji'', {{zh|t=皇明表忠紀|labels=no}}), a biography of loyal Ming officials, and the ''Edicts of the Imperial Ming'' (''Huang Ming Zhaozhi'', {{zh|t=皇明詔制|labels=no}}), a list of Imperial proclamations. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, Hu renamed the studio the Hall Rooted in the Past  (''Digutang'', {{zh|t=迪古堂|labels=no}}) as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty, although the Ten Bamboo imprint continued to be used. Despite Hu's withdrawal from society after 1646, the studio continued to publish well into the Qing dynasty, for the most part focussing on seal impression catalogues showcasing Hu's carving work.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

The Ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in China.&lt;ref name=Wu&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = Kuang-Ch'ing | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 1943 | title = Ming Printing and Printers | journal = Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 203–210 | publisher = Harvard-Yenching Institute | doi = 10.2307/2718015 | jstor = 2718015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HKHMuseum&gt;{{cite web|title=The Art of Chinese Traditional Woodblock Printing|url=http://hk.heritage.museum/documents/2199315/2199693/Chinese_Woodblock_Printing_E.pdf|publisher=Hong Kong Heritage Museum|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his studio, Hu Zhengyan experimented with various forms of [[Woodblock printing#Colour|woodblock printing]], creating processes for producing [[Color printing|multi-coloured prints]] and [[Paper embossing|embossed]] printed designs.&lt;ref name="DainianCohen1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fan|first1=Dainian|last2=Cohen|first2=R.S.|title=Chinese Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jaQH6_8Ju-MC&amp;pg=PA464|accessdate=29 May 2013|date=30 September 1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-3463-7|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he was able to produce some of China's first printed publications in colour, using a block printing technique known as "assorted block printing" (''douban yinshua'', {{zh|t=饾板印刷|labels=no}}).&lt;ref name=Chinadaily&gt;{{cite web|title=Hu Zhengyan |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_madeinchina/2005-06/28/content_70179.htm |work=China Culture |publisher=China Daily |accessdate=29 May 2013 |date=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042458/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_madeinchina/2005-06/28/content_70179.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4693/|title=Selected Anecdotes about Su Shi and Mi Fu|author=Guo, Hua|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|work=Chinese Rare Book Collection|date=1621|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hegel1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hegel|first=Robert E.|title=Reading Illustrated Fiction in the Late Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=492lAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA408|accessdate=29 May 2013|year=1998|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-3002-0|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system made use of multiple blocks, each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour.&lt;ref name=NPM&gt;{{cite web|title=Applying colors|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/exh98/books_archives/en_02_4.html|website=Gems of the Rare Books from the National Palace Museum's Collections|publisher=National Palace Museum|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a lengthy, painstaking process, requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy inkings and impressions to create a single image.&lt;ref name="Lu2014"/&gt; Hu also employed a related form of multiple-block printing called "set-block printing" (''taoban yinshua'', {{zh|t=套板印刷|labels=no}}), which had existed since the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan period]] some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again.&lt;ref name=Rawson/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ding2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ding|first=Naifei|title=Obscene Things: Sexual Politics in Jin Ping Mei|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8KmkkFmAqgC&amp;pg=PA54|date=18 July 2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-2916-6|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrayDorofeeva-Lichtmann2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bray|first1=Francesca|last2=Dorofeeva-Lichtmann|first2=Vera|last3=Métailié|first3=Georges|title=Graphics and Text in the Production of Technical Knowledge in China: The Warp and the Weft|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UXMrAtNLWoC&amp;pg=PA464|date=1 January 2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-16063-9|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing; this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible.&lt;ref name=Ebrey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebrey|first1=Thomas|title=The Editions, Superstates and States of the ''Ten Bamboo Studio Collection of Calligraphy and Painting''|url=http://gest.princeton.edu/EALJ/ebrey_thomas.ealj.v14.n01.p001.pdf|website=East Asian Library and Gest Collection|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some images, Hu employed a blind embossing technique (known as "embossed designs" (''gonghua'', {{zh|t=拱花|labels=no}}) or "embossed blocks" (''gongban'',  {{zh|t=拱板|labels=no}}), using an uninked, imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper. He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants.&lt;ref name="Lu2014"/&gt; This was a relatively new process, having been invented by Hu's contemporary [[Wu Faxiang]], who was also a Nanjing-based publisher. Wu had used this technique for the first time in his book ''Wisteria Studio Letter Paper'' (''Luoxuan Biangu Jianpu'', {{zh|t=蘿軒變古箋譜|labels=no}}), published in 1626.&lt;ref name="EliotRose2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliot|first1=Simon|last2=Rose|first2=Jonathan|title=A Companion to the History of the Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFiDCjMcnvcC&amp;pg=PA107|date=24 August 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5658-8|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NeedhamTsuen-Hsuin1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Needham|first1=Joseph|last2=Tsien|first2=Tsuen-Hsuin|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1, Paper and Printing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx-9mS6Aa4wC&amp;pg=PA286|date=11 July 1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-08690-5|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hu and Wu used embossing to create decorative writing papers, the sale of which provided a sideline income for the Ten Bamboo Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Suzanne|editor-last=Richter|editor-first=Antje|chapter=Chinese Decorated Letter Papers|title=A History of Chinese Letters and Epistolary Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VTq2CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA972|date=28 April 2015|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-29212-3|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==
[[File:Hu Zhengyan - Bamboo in snow 1.PNG|thumbnail|''Bamboo in snow'' from the 'Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy'']]
Hu's most notable work is the ''Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy'' (''Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu'', {{zh|t=十竹齋書畫譜|labels=no}}), an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists (including Hu himself), published in 1633. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, [[Bamboo painting|bamboo]], flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes.&lt;ref name="NeedhamTsuen-Hsuin1985"/&gt; As well as a collection of artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsien&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsien|first1=Tsuen-Hsuin|title=Book Review: Chinese Colour Prints from the Ten Bamboo Studio|journal=Journal of Asian Studies|date=February 1975|volume=34|issue=2|page=514|doi=10.2307/2052768|jstor=2052768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Hu used his multiple-block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps.&lt;ref name="BrayDorofeeva-Lichtmann2007"/&gt; The manual is bound in the [[Traditional Chinese bookbinding#History|"butterfly binding"]] (''hudie zhuang'', {{zh|t=蝴蝶裝|labels=no}}) style, whereby whole-folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double-page spread. This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image.&lt;ref name=Rawson/&gt; Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shi zhu zhai shu hua pu (FH.910.83-98)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-FH-00910-00083-00098/1|website=University of Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said Charles Aylmer, Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department, "The binding is so fragile, and the manual so delicate, that until it was digitized, we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its undoubted importance to scholars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One of World's Oldest Books Printed in Multi-Color Now Opened &amp; Digitized for the First Time|url=http://www.openculture.com/2015/08/one-of-worlds-oldest-books-printed-in-multi-color-now-opened-digitized-for-the-first-time.html|website=Open Culture|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This volume went on to influence colour printing across China, where it paved the way for the later but better-known ''[[Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden]]'' (''Jieziyuan Huazhuan'' {{zh|t=芥子園畫傳|labels=no}}), and also in [[Japan]], where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in [[ukiyo-e]] of the colour woodblock printing process known as ''[[nishiki-e]]'' {{nihongo|錦絵}}.&lt;ref name="Kuiper2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuiper|first=Kathleen|title=The Culture of China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePytAJX0yZcC&amp;pg=PA213|accessdate=29 May 2013|year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-61530-140-9|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michener1954"&gt;{{cite book|last=Michener|first=James Albert|title=The Floating World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWH3P_CuEPsC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=3 June 2013|year=1954|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-0873-0|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Paine&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paine|first1=Robert T.

Hu also produced the work ''Ten Bamboo Studio Letter Paper'' (''Shizhuzhai Jianpu'', {{zh|t=十竹齋箋譜|labels=no}}), a collection of paper samples, which made use of the ''gonghua'' stamped embossing technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief.&lt;ref name=Rawson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chinadaily/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The East Asian Library Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slA8AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=29 May 2013|year=1998|publisher=Gest Library of Princeton University|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulik1974"&gt;{{cite book|last=van Gulik|first=Robert H.|title=中國古代房内考: A Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from Ca. 1500 B.C.

===Other publications===
Other works produced by Hu's studio included a reprint of [[Zhou Boqi]]'s manual of seal-script calligraphy, ''The Six Styles of Calligraphy, Correct and Erroneous'' (''Liushu Zheng'e'', {{zh|t=六書正譌|labels=no}}) and the related ''Necessary Investigations into Calligraphy'' (''Shufa Bi Ji'', {{zh|t=書法必稽|labels=no}}), which discussed common errors in the formation of characters. With his brother Zhengxin, Hu edited a new introductory edition of the [[Chinese classics|Confucian classics]], entitled ''The Standardised Text of the [[Four Books and Five Classics#Four Books|Four Books]], Identified and Corrected'' (''Sishu Dingben Bianzheng'', {{zh|t=四書定本辨正|labels=no}}) (1640), giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text. A similar approach was taken with the ''Essentials of the [[Thousand Character Classic]] in Six Scripts'' (''Qianwen Liushu Tongyao'', {{zh|t=千文六書統要|labels=no}}) (1663), which Hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher, Li Deng. It was published after Li's death, partly in homage to him.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

The three Hu brothers worked together to collate a student primer on poetry by their contemporary Ye Tingxiu, which was called simply the ''Discussion of Poetry'' (''Shi Tan'', {{zh|t=詩譚|labels=no}}) (1635). Other works on poetry from the studio included ''Helpful Principles to the Subtle Workings of Selected Tang Poems'' (''Leixuan Tang Shi Zhudao Weiji'', {{zh|t=類選唐詩助道微機|labels=no}}), which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included [[Colophon (publishing)|colophons]] by Hu Zhengyan himself.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

Among the studio's more obscure publications was a text on [[Chinese dominoes]] entitled ''Paitong Fuyu'' ({{zh|t=牌統浮玉|labels=no}}), written under a pseudonym but with a preface by Hu Zhengyan.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1995">'''L'Increvable''' is the name given to the [[washing machine]] built to last 50 years and created by french designer Julien Phedyaeff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberation.fr/terre/2015/03/25/mon-lave-linge-et-moi-c-est-pour-la-vie_1228260&lt;/ref&gt; It is a device that comes as an assembly kit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexpress.fr/tendances/produit-high-tech/une-machine-a-laver-increvable_1665182.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and description of the machine ==

According to Julien Phedyaeff, the idea dates back to 2013, during his master's thesis on 'extended research on object dismantling practises'. He made a report that detailed how spare parts, when available, were sold at exceedingly high prices. His invention is designed to be delivered in kit from 'a healthy, solid and improvable base'. In order for it to be lighter, the washing machine lacks a [[concrete]] ballast. It is replaced by a reservoir which fills with water during the first use. 
The machine originally was a project presented for his diploma at the [[École nationale supérieure de création industrielle|École Nationale Supérieure de Création Industrielle]] which he obtained in June 2014. The project received congratulations from the jury and obtained a label from 'l’Observeur du design 2015'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.entreprises.gouv.fr/secteurs-professionnels/l-observeur-design-2015-technologique-securitaire-ecolo-ludique&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LightScribe''' is an [[optical disc recording technologies|optical disc recording technology]] that was created by the [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard Company]]. It uses specially coated [[CD-R|recordable CD]] and [[DVD recordable|DVD]] media to produce [[laser]]-etched labels with text or graphics, as opposed to stick-on labels and printable discs. Although HP no longer is developing the technology it is still maintained and supported by a number of independent enthusiasts.

The LightScribe method uses the laser in a way similar to when plain data are written to the disc; a [[greyscale]] image of the label is etched onto the upper side of the disc. In the beginning, the discs were available only in a [[Sepia (color)|sepia]] color but today are available in many [[monochrome|monochromatic]] colors.

The purpose of LightScribe is to allow users to create direct-to-disc labels (as opposed to stick-on labels), using their optical disc writer. Special discs and a compatible disc writer are required. Before or after burning data to the read-side of the disc, the user turns the disc over and inserts it with the label side down. The drive's laser then etches into the label side in such a way that an image is produced.

== History ==
LightScribe was conceived by [[Hewlett-Packard]] engineer [[Daryl Anderson (engineer)|Daryl Anderson]], and the coating's chemistry was developed by Dr. Makarand Gore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h30187.www3.hp.com/articles/viewArticle/p/courseId/35814?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN |title=HP Online classes&amp;nbsp;– Getting started with LightScribe |publisher=H30187.www3.hp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712224456/http://h30187.www3.hp.com/articles/viewArticle/p/courseId/35814?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN |archivedate=2011-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and brought to market through the joint design efforts of HP's imaging and optical storage divisions in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h71036.www7.hp.com/hho/cache/316789-0-0-225-121.html |title=HP LightScribe&amp;nbsp;– frequently asked questions |publisher=H71036.www7.hp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/114211/lightscribe_simplifies_dvd_labeling.html |title=HP's invention, due in drives soon, lets users burn labels directly onto discs |publisher=Pcworld.com |date=2004-01-12 |accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first direct to disc labeling technology that allowed users to laser etch images to the label side of a disc. [[DiscT@2]] technology had been on the market since 2002, but [[DiscT@2]] allows users to burn only to the unused portion of the data side of the disc. In 2005, [[LabelFlash]] became the main competitor for LightScribe.

Various brands manufacture the required media. Dual Layer DVD+Rs are currently the highest-capacity disc to support the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verbatim.com/subcat/optical-media/lightscribe/|title=- Verbatim|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has yet to be any development of LightScribe Blu-ray discs.

Companies such as [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Samsung]], [[LaCie]] and [[LiteOn]] have discontinued or are phasing out LightScribe drives {{asof|2013|June|lc=y}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skinflint.co.uk/eu/?cat=dvdram&amp;xf=577_LightScribe&amp;sort=eintr |title=Market availability of lightScribe drives |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with only [[LG]] continuing to manufacturing drives; until the manufacturing of LG LightScribe drives was discontinued{{when|date=July 2018}}.

{{asof|2013|November|26}},&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; LightScribe.com HP's official LightScribe website has been removed. This has been replaced with the following message:

{{Quote|Thank you for your interest in the LightScribe disc labeling technology. This website is no longer active. LightScribe software and disc utilities may be found on a number of public websites.}}

{{asof|2018|April}}, the website returns a 404 error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightscribe.com/ |title=Not Found |date=27 September 2014 |publisher= |accessdate=24 December 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827222301/http://www.lightscribe.com/ |archivedate=27 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, on HP Desktop PCs Customer Support, it still has an article of instructions and FAQ about LightScribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HP Desktop PCs - Creating Disc Labels with LightScribe|url=https://support.hp.com/ee-en/document/c00208298|website=HP Customer Support|publisher=HP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2018|November}}, the website now redirects to [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s homepage.

== Mode of operation ==
The surface of a LightScribe disc is coated with a reactive [[dye]] that changes [[color]] when it absorbs 780&amp;nbsp;nm infrared laser light. The etched label will show no noticeable fading under exposure to indoor lighting for at least two years.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Optical media should always be stored in a protective sleeve or case that keeps the data content in the dark and safe from scratches. If stored this way, the label should last the life of the disc in real-world applications.

LightScribe labels burn in concentric circles, moving outward from the center of the disc. Images with the largest diameters will take longest to burn.

LightScribe is [[monochrome|monochromatic]], initially a [[grey]] etch on a [[gold (color)|gold]]-looking surface. From late 2006, LightScribe discs are also available in various surface colors, under the v1.2 specification. The etching is still in shades of grey.

It is not possible to replace a LightScribe label with a new design (as in erase the surface of the disc), but it is possible to add more content to a label that has already been burned.

The center of every LightScribe disc has a unique code that allows the drive to know the precise rotational position of the disc. This, in combination with the drive hardware, allows it to know the precise position from the center outwards, and the disc can be labeled while spinning at high speed using these references. It also serves a secondary purpose: the same disc can be labeled with the same image multiple times. Each successive labeling will darken the blacks and increase image contrast (see drawbacks).  Successive burns are perfectly aligned.

== Drawbacks ==
Special storage precautions are necessary to prevent LightScribe discs from fading. HP's LightScribe website warns users to "keep discs away from extreme heat, humidity and direct sunlight", "store them in a cool, dark place", "use polypropylene disc sleeves rather than PVC sleeves", and also notes that "residual chemicals on your fingers could cause discoloration of the label image". Such chemicals include common hand lotions and hair care products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightscribe.com/support/index.aspx?id=301 |title=Support: FAQ: Burning a Label |publisher=LightScribe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102022259/http://lightscribe.com/support/index.aspx?id=301 |archivedate=2010-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Users not observing these precautions have reported{{examples|date=March 2015}} LightScribe discs to become visibly faded within two months in the worst case. This drawback makes the technology unsuitable for applications involving continuous handling, and for such popular uses as car music compilation discs, which typically have unavoidable high light and temperature exposure. Since many disc players present internal temperatures significantly higher than room temperature, LightScribe discs should also not be left in disc players for long periods of time.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

LightScribe discs may form a visible white powder coating. This is due to crystallization of some of the label-side coating. It is not harmful and can easily be removed with a water-dampened cloth. Wiping the disc with a damp cloth does not harm the inscribed label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightscribe.com/support/index.aspx?id=302 |title=Support: FAQ: Support and System Software |publisher=LightScribe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102022354/http://lightscribe.com/support/index.aspx?id=302 |archivedate=2010-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, LightScribe support has not explained which conditions lead to this reaction, nor the precautions that can be taken to avoid it.

Multiple LightScribes of the same image increases contrast, but the image quality decreases with successive burns. Noticeable contrast variations are seen in solid shades.

== Other uses ==

A LightScribe optical drive was used by Maher El-Kady, a graduate of UCLA in 2012 to successfully turn a specially prepared [[graphite oxide]] layer coated onto a DVD into [[graphene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graphene-battery.net/graphene.htm |title=Graphene information |publisher=www.graphene-battery.net |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; El-Kady and [[Richard Kaner]], his lab professor, used an unmodified LightScribe drive. The disc was prepared by coating the disc with an aqueous solution of graphite oxide and allowing it to dry. Areas of the coating illuminated by the LightScribe laser were turned into graphene. Various shapes can be drawn, which allowed the scientist duo essentially to laser-print an [[ultracapacitor]] on graphene using consumer-grade technology.

This '''list of Indian inventions and discoveries''' details the inventions, scientific discoveries and contributions of premodern and modern India, including both the ancient, classical and post classical nations in the subcontinent historically [[History of India|referred to as India]] and the modern Indian state. It draws from the whole [[culture of India|cultural]] and [[history of Indian science and technology|technological history]] of India, during which [[Architecture of India|architecture]], [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Cartography of India|cartography]], [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|metallurgy]], [[Indian logic|logic]], [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]], [[History of measurement systems in India|metrology]] and [[Mining in India|mineralogy]] were among the branches of study pursued by [[:Category:Indian academics|its scholars]]. During recent times [[science and technology in the Republic of India]] has also focused on [[Automobile industry in India|automobile engineering]], [[Information technology in India|information technology]], [[Communications in India|communications]] as well as research into [[Indian Space Research Organisation|space]] and [[Indian Antarctic Program|polar]] technology.

For the purposes of this list, [[invention]]s are regarded as technological firsts developed in India, and as such does not include foreign technologies which India acquired through contact. It also does not include technologies or discoveries developed elsewhere and later invented separately in India, nor inventions by Indian emigres in other places. Changes in minor concepts of design or style and artistic innovations do not appear on in the lists.

=== Metrology ===
* [[Ruler]]: [[Rulers]] made from Ivory were in use by the Indus Valley Civilization in what today is Pakistan and Northwestern India prior to 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=Whitelaw14/&gt; Excavations at Lothal (2400&amp;nbsp;BCE) have yielded one such ruler calibrated to about 1/16 of an inch—less than 2 [[millimeters]].&lt;ref name=Whitelaw14&gt;Whitelaw, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Whitelaw (2007) holds that 'The [[Mohenjodaro]] ruler is divided into units corresponding to 1.32 inches (33.5&amp;nbsp;mm) and these are marked out in decimal subdivisions with amazing accuracy—to within 0.005 of an inch. They correspond closely with the "hasta" increments of 1 3/8 inches traditionally used in South India in ancient architecture. Ancient bricks found throughout the region have dimensions that correspond to these units.'&lt;ref name=Whitelaw15&gt;Whitelaw, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Shigeo Iwata (2008) further writes 'The minimum division of graduation found in the segment of an ivory-made linear measure excavated in Lothal was 1.79&amp;nbsp;mm (that corresponds to 1/940 of a fathom), while that of the fragment of a shell-made one from [[Mohenjodaro]] was 6.72&amp;nbsp;mm (1/250 of a fathom), and that of bronze-made one from Harappa was 9.33&amp;nbsp;mm (1/180 of a fathom).'&lt;ref name=Iwata2254/&gt; The weights and measures of the Indus civilization also reached Persia and [[Central Asia]], where they were further modified.&lt;ref name=Iwata2254&gt;Iwata, 2254&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[History of measurement systems in India|Weighing scale]]: The earliest evidence for the existence of weighing scale dates to 2400 BC-1800 BC in the Indus valley civilization prior to which no banking was performed due to lack of scales.&lt;ref name="jstor44"&gt;{{cite web|author=Petruso, Karl M|title="Early Weights and Weighing in Egypt and the Indus Valley", M Bulletin |publisher=Boston Museum of Fine Arts|volume=79|year=1981|pages=44–51|jstor=4171634|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Incense clock]]: The incense clock is a timekeeping device used to measure minutes, hours, or days, incense clocks were commonly used at homes and temples in dynastic times. Although popularly associated with China the incense clock is believed to have originated in India, at least in its fundamental form if not function.&lt;ref name=Schafer161&gt;Schafer (1963), pages 160-161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bedini69&gt;Bedini (1994), pages 69–80&lt;/ref&gt; Early incense clocks found in China between the 6th and 8th centuries CE—the period it appeared in China all seem to have [[Devanagari|Devanāgarī]] carvings on them instead of Chinese seal characters.&lt;ref name=Schafer161/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bedini69/&gt; Incense itself was introduced to China from India in the early centuries CE, along with the spread of Buddhism by traveling monks.&lt;ref name=Bedini25&gt;Bedini (1994), page 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seiwert96&gt;Seiwert (2003), page 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kumar0565&gt;Kumar, Yukteshwar (2005), page 65&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward H. Schafer|Edward Schafer]] asserts that incense clocks were probably an Indian invention, transmitted to China, which explains the Devanāgarī inscriptions on early incense clocks found in China.&lt;ref name=Schafer161/&gt; [[Silvio Bedini]] on the other hand asserts that incense clocks were derived in part from incense seals mentioned in [[Tantric Buddhism|Tantric Buddhist]] scriptures, which first came to light in China after those scriptures from India were translated into Chinese, but holds that the time-telling function of the seal was incorporated by the Chinese.&lt;ref name=Bedini69/&gt;

===Metallurgy and Metals manufacturing===
* [[Crucible steel]]: Perhaps as early as 300&amp;nbsp;BC—although certainly by 200 BC—high quality steel was being produced in southern India, by what Europeans would later call the crucible technique.&lt;ref name=Juleff&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Juleff | first1 = G | year = 1996 | title = An ancient wind powered iron smelting technology in Sri Lanka | doi = 10.1038/379060a0 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 379 | issue = 6560| pages = 60–63 | bibcode = 1996Natur.379...60J }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system, high-purity wrought iron, charcoal, and glass were mixed in a crucible and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon.&lt;ref name=Juleff/&gt;

* [[Mysorean rockets]]: The first iron-cased and metal-cylinder [[rocket]]s were developed by [[Tipu Sultan]], ruler of the South Indian [[Kingdom of Mysore]], and his father [[Haither Ali]], in the 1780s. He successfully used these iron-cased rockets against the larger forces of the [[British East India Company]] during the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. The Mysore Rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2&amp;nbsp;km range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the [[Congreve rocket]], and were soon put into use in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Roddam Narasimha (1985), [http://nal-ir.nal.res.in/2382/01/tr_pd_du_8503_R66305.pdf Rockets in Mysore and Britain, 1750–1850 A.D.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182042/http://nal-ir.nal.res.in/2382/01/tr_pd_du_8503_R66305.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}, National Aeronautical Laboratory and Indian Institute of Science"Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Hyder Ali's son, [[Tippu Sultan]], continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at [[Seringapatam]] in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British." - Encyclopædia Britannica (2008). ''rocket and missile.''&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Shrikhande graph]]: [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|Graph]] invented by the Indian mathematician S.S. Shrikhande in 1959.
* [[Sign convention]]: Symbols, signs and mathematical notation were employed in an early form in India by the 6th century when the mathematician-astronomer Aryabhata recommended the use of letters to represent unknown quantities.&lt;ref name=Bell96&gt;Bell (1992), page 96&lt;/ref&gt; By the 7th century Brahmagupta had already begun using abbreviations for unknowns, even for multiple unknowns occurring in one complex problem.&lt;ref name=Bell96/&gt; Brahmagupta also managed to use abbreviations for square roots and cube roots.&lt;ref name=Bell96/&gt; By the 7th century fractions were written in a manner similar to the modern times, except for the bar separating the [[numerator]] and the [[denominator]].&lt;ref name=Bell96/&gt; A dot symbol for [[negative numbers]] was also employed.&lt;ref name=Bell96/&gt; The [[Bakhshali Manuscript]] displays a cross, much like the modern '+' sign, except that it symbolized subtraction when written just after the number affected.&lt;ref name=Bell96/&gt; The '=' sign for equality did not exist.&lt;ref name=Bell96/&gt; Indian mathematics was transmitted to the Islamic world where this notation was seldom accepted initially and the scribes continued to write mathematics in full and without symbols.&lt;ref name=Bell97&gt;Bell (1992), page 97&lt;/ref&gt;
*Modern [[elementary arithmetic]]: Modum indorum or the method of the Indians for arithmetic operations was popularized by al-khwarizmi and al-kindi by means of their respective works such as   in Al-Khwarizmi's On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals (ca. 825), On the Use of the Indian Numerals (ca. 830)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Kindi biography|url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Al-Kindi.html|website=www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026091801/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Al-Kindi.html|archivedate=26 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as early as the 8th and 9th centuries.They, amongst other works, contributed to the diffusion of the Indian system of arithmetic in the Middle-East and the West.The significance of the development of the positional number system is described by the French mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace (1749–1827) who wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is India that gave us the ingenuous method of expressing all numbers by the means of ten symbols, each symbol receiving a value of position, as well as an absolute value; a profound and important idea which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit, but its very simplicity, the great ease which it has lent to all computations, puts our arithmetic in the first rank of useful inventions, and we shall appreciate the grandeur of this achievement when we remember that it escaped the genius of Archimedes and Apollonius, two of the greatest minds produced by antiquity."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Trigonometric function]]s : The [[Trigonometry|trigonometric]] functions ''sine'' and ''versine'' originated in [[Indian astronomy]], adapted from the full-chord Greek versions (to the modern half-chord versions). They were described in detail by [[Aryabhata]] in the late 5th century, but were likely developed earlier in the [[Pancha-Siddhantika|Siddhantas]], astronomical treatises of the 3rd or 4th century.&lt;ref name=Pingree1&gt;Pingree (2003): {{quote|"Geometry, and its branch trigonometry, was the mathematics Indian astronomers used most frequently. In fact, the Indian astronomers in the third or fourth century, using a pre-Ptolemaic Greek table of chords, produced tables of sines and versines, from which it was trivial to derive cosines. This new system of trigonometry, produced in India, was transmitted to the Arabs in the late eighth century and by them, in an expanded form, to the Latin West and the Byzantine East in the twelfth century."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MactutorTrigo&gt;J.

Ayurveda has evolved over thousands of years, and is still practiced today.  In an internationalized form, it can be thought of as a [[complementary and alternative medicine]].  In village settings, away from urban centres, it is simply "medicine."  The Sanskrit word आयुर्वेदः (''āyur-vedaḥ'') means "knowledge ''(veda'') for longevity (''āyur'')".&lt;ref name="Chopra75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chopra|2003|p = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siddha medicine is mostly prevalent in South India, and is transmitted in Tamil, not Sanskrit, texts.

It was developed in 1999 by 7 scientists of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, led by Dr. Swami Manohar in collaboration with Encore India, a company based in Bangalore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simputer Definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/51379/simputer|website=www.pcmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally envisaged to bring internet to the masses of India, the Simputer and its derivatives are today widely utilized by governments of several Indian states as part of their e-governance drive, the Indian Army, as well as by other public and private organizations.
*[[Backus-naur form]]: In [[computer science]], '''Backus–Naur form''' or '''Backus normal form''' ('''BNF''') or  '''Panini Backus form'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Ingerman|first= P. Z.|title= "Pāṇini Backus Form" suggested|journal= Communications of the ACM|volume= 10|issue= 3|page= 137|year= 1967|doi= 10.1145/363162.363165
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[metasyntax|notation technique]] for [[context-free grammar]]s, often used to describe the [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] of [[Formal language#Programming languages|languages]] used in computing, such as computer [[programming language]]s, [[document format]]s, [[instruction set]]s and [[communication protocol]]s. They are applied wherever exact descriptions of languages are needed: for instance, in official language specifications, in manuals, and in textbooks on programming language theory.The idea of describing the structure of language using rewriting rules can be traced back to at least the work of [[Pāṇini]] (who lived sometime between the 7th and 4th century [[BCE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Panini.html |title=Panini biography |publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland|accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ingerman |first=Peter Zilahy |date=March 1967 |title="Pāṇini-Backus Form" Suggested |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=363165 |journal=Communications of the ACM |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |volume=10 |issue=3 |page=137 |doi=10.1145/363162.363165 |accessdate=24 September 2014}} Ingerman suggests that the Backus Normal Form be renamed to the [[Pāṇini]]-Backus Form, to give due credit to Pāṇini as the earliest independent inventor.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Pāṇini Backus form'' has also been suggested in view of the fact that the expansion ''Backus normal form'' may not be accurate, and that [[Pāṇini]] had independently developed a similar notation earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Ingerman|first= P. Z.|title= "Pāṇini Backus Form" suggested|journal= Communications of the ACM|volume= 10|issue= 3|page= 137|year= 1967|doi= 10.1145/363162.363165}}&lt;/ref&gt; His notation to describe [[Sanskrit]] word structure notation is equivalent in power to that of Backus and has many similar properties.

===Linguistics===
*[[Formal grammar]]: [[Pāṇini|Panini]] in his treatise,Astadyayi gives formal production rules and definitions to describe the formal grammar of [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panini biography|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Panini.html|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[formal language|formal language theory]], a '''grammar''' (when the context is not given, often called a '''formal grammar''' for clarity) is a set of [[Production (computer science)|production rule]]s for [[String (computer science)|strings]] in a [[formal language]]. The rules describe how to form strings from the language's [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] that are valid according to the language's [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]]. A grammar does not describe the [[semantics|meaning of the strings]] or what can be done with them in whatever context—only their form.
*[[Same language subtitling]] (SLS) for literacy promotion: SLS refers to the idea of subtitling in the same language as the audio, converse to the original idea of subtitling, which was to present a different language, and adopted in the 1970s as a means to offer television services to the hard of hearing, and soon after as means of entertainment through Karaoke machines. The idea of using the technology for literacy promotion was struck upon by Brij Kothari, who believed that SLS makes reading practice an incidental, automatic,and subconscious part of popular TV entertainment, at a low per-person cost to shore up literacy rates in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brij Kothari: Literacy {{!}} Ripples of Curiosity|url=http://tedxcern.web.cern.ch/speakers/brij-kothari-literacy|website=tedxcern.web.cern.ch|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His idea was well received by the Government of India who now uses SLS on several national channels. For his idea, Kothari was adjudged a winner at the Development Marketplace— the World Bank’s Innovation Award which gave him enough funds to implement this programme nationally.The SLS innovation has been recognised by the Institute for Social Inventions, UK and the Tech Museum of Innovations, San Jose, USA and is the recipient of the International Literacy Prize from the Library of Congress (Washington, D.C.) and awards from the All Children Reading Grand Challenge (USAID), Tech Museum of Innovation (San Jose), the Institute for Social Inventions (London) and the NASSOM Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brij Kothari {{!}} The Huffington Post|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/author/brij-554|work=m.huffpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metrology===
*[[Standardization]]: The oldest applications and evidence of standardisation come from the Indus valley civilization in the 5th millennium BC&lt;ref name=Iwata2254&gt;Iwata, 2254&lt;/ref&gt; characterised by the existence of weights in various standards and categories as&lt;ref name=Kenoyer265/&gt; well as the Indus merchants usage of a centralised weight and measure system. Small weights were used to measure luxury goods, and larger weights were used for buying bulkier items, such as food grains etc.&lt;ref name=Kenoyer265&gt;Kenoyer, 265&lt;/ref&gt; The weights and measures of the Indus civilisation also reached [[Persia]] and [[Central Asia]], where they were further modified.&lt;ref name=Iwata2254_quote&gt;In the third millennium BCE the Indus measuring system was further developed in the ancient regions of Iran and Afghanistan -- Iwata, 2254.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Technical standards]]: Technical standards were being applied and used in the [[Indus valley civilization]] since the 5th millennium BC to enable gauging devices to be effectively used in [[angular measurement]] and [[measurement]] in construction.&lt;ref name=Baber_b&gt;Baber, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Uniform units of length were used in the planning and construction of towns such as [[Lothal]], [[Surkotada]], [[Kalibangan]], [[Dholavira]], [[Harappa]], and [[Mohenjo-daro]].&lt;ref name=Iwata2254/&gt; The weights and measures of the Indus civilisation also reached [[Persia]] and [[Central Asia]], where they were further modified.&lt;ref name=Iwata2254_quote&gt;In the third millennium BCE the Indus measuring system was further developed in the ancient regions of Iran and Afghanistan -- Iwata, 2254.&lt;/ref&gt; Shigeo Iwata describes the excavated weights unearthed from the Indus civilisation:

 &lt;blockquote&gt; A total of 558 weights were excavated from Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and [[Chanhudaro|Chanhu-daro]], not including defective weights. They did not find statistically significant differences between weights that were excavated from five different layers, each about 1.5&amp;nbsp;m in thickness. This was evidence that strong control existed for at least a 500-year period. The 13.7-g weight seems to be one of the units used in the Indus valley. The notation was based on the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] and [[decimal]] systems. 83% of the weights which were excavated from the above three cities were cubic, and 68% were made of [[chert]].&lt;ref name=Iwata2254/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''MT4 ECN Bridge''' is a technology that allows a user to access [[interbank foreign exchange market]] through the [[MetaTrader 4]] (MT4) [[electronic trading platform]].  MT4 was designed to allow trading between a broker and its clients and so did not provide for passing orders through to wholesale forex market via [[electronic communication network]]s (ECNs).&lt;ref&gt;Jerry W Markham. A Financial History of the United States: From Enron-Era Scandals to the Subprime Crisis (2004-2006); From the Subprime Crisis to the Great Recession (2006-2009). - Routledge. - 2007 - {{ISBN|978-0-7656-2431-4}}. - p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response a number of third party software companies developed [[Straight-through processing]] bridging software&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gorham, Nidhi Signh. Electronic Exchanges: The Global trandformation from Pits to Bids. - Elsevier Inc. - 2009. - {{ISBN|978-0-12-374252-0}}. - p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the MT4 server to pass orders placed by clients directly to an ECN and feed trade confirmations back automatically.

==Background==
Retail [[foreign exchange brokers]] in general are divided into two categories:
* Dealing desk brokers or [[market maker]]s that execute [[Order (exchange)|orders]] and keep the position in that broker’s inner [[Market liquidity|liquidity pool]].  A DD broker is a specific broker who employs dealers that may either accept or reject orders from retail traders (re-quotes) depending on whether or not the broker is interested in accepting the specific order or not.
* Non-Dealing Desk (NDD) brokers or [[direct market access]] where the broker simply passes the order to the [[interbank foreign exchange market]].

The MetaTrader4 trading platform was designed for dealing desk brokers, but the popularity of the trading platform meant that [[retail forex trading|retail forex traders]] as well as brokers wanted to provide a way to trade directly on the interbank foreign exchange market via MT4.

== Bridge software ==
A number of software companies attempted to develop bridging technology that allowed the broker to connect the MT4 server to an ECN.  The first practical  solution to '''bridging MT4 and ECN''' appeared in 2006. There are two main types of bridge technology which effects the way orders are processed: the [[straight-through processing|STP]] and [[electronic communication network|ECN]] models.  The table below shows the main differences.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! MT4 ECN bridge !! MT4 STP bridge

| Client’s orders go directly to the marketplace and are displayed there as they are || Yes || No
|-
| Clients can see and use market depth (Level 2) || Yes || No
|-
| Partial execution is implemented || Yes || No
|-
|}

[[Electronic communication network|ECN]] means direct access to the market where you can trade with other traders. Your orders are actually displayed in the market and are seen by others, who in turn can introduce their own orders and if the prices match, a deal is complete.

=== Main features ===
* True [[electronic communication network|ECN]] execution - clients trade with other traders, orders are displayed and seen by others on the market;
* Tight [[Bid-offer spread|spreads]] - there is only a difference between best [[Bid price|bid]] and [[Ask price|offer]] prices, if a client places an order with a better price, it changes the [[Bid-offer spread|spread]];
* Relatively Fast execution - orders are typically executed within 0.3 sec on the server side;
* Possibility of partial execution - in case of insufficient liquidity the order can be partially executed while the rest will be displayed and seen on the marketplace;
* [[Market depth]] can be provided via a special add-in module to show the depth of the market also known as ''Level 2'' - a measure of the size of volume available for transaction purposes for a particular instrument at a particular point of time. The best Offer (ASK) and the best bid are displayed in a table with the size available to buy or sell. Market depth displays orders that are currently in the market. When two orders match (buy and sell orders at the same price), they are filled and disappear from the market depth and the deal is registered in the trade history.

=== Difficulties of true ECN trading for retail traders ===
* [[Volatility (finance)|Price volatility]] can be greater in comparison to quotes of [[market maker]]s who may use fluctuations filtering while the NDD model provides direct access to the [[interbank foreign exchange market]].
* Market makers' quotes are not related to the volume, i.e. orders may be filled at the offered price without any relation to the deal volume. While using the ECN the market presents the [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] that is currently available, i.e. orders will be executed in the volume available at this certain price.
* [[Bid–offer spread]] can vary significantly with market conditions reflecting actual interbank market prices which can cause problems with stops.  Market Makers will typically hold spreads at a fixed level to avoid confusion for retail traders and avoid stops and limits being hit when prices are unstable.

'''Medi Script''' was North America’s first instant credit system.  Developed in 1965-67 by the West brothers in [[Vancouver]], B.C., Canada, the system was designed to provide [[consumer credit]] at the retail store level, something that did not exist at that point in history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

At that time the Canadian [[chartered bank]]s controlled all the legal credit granting ability with the exception of vehicle fuel companies like the [[Esso]] [[credit card]] which was not available to general merchants and shop keepers. The West brothers hoped to change this.

Medi Script was designed to allow individual storeowners and merchants the ability to grant controlled, third party credit to their customers by subscribing for a fee to the Medi Script company who would then in turn provide the active credit for the customers in question.

The name Medi Script was used because of an obscure law at the time that allowed the medical establishment to grant credit.

While salespeople were actively marketing this new idea the Royal Bank of Canada was looking at the Medi Script company with the stated intent of purchasing the company and the rights to the Medi Script concept. During the negotiation process in 1968 the Royal Bank launched their own version dubbed the [[Chargex]] Credit card. Subsequently, the deal with the West brothers collapsed and their business collapsed as their idea took on a new life without them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51868">'''Microfluidics''' deals with the behaviour, precise control and manipulation of [[fluids]] that are geometrically constrained to a small, typically sub-millimeter, scale at which capillary penetration governs mass transport. It is a multidisciplinary field at the intersection of [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[nanotechnology]], and [[biotechnology]], with practical applications in the design of systems in which low volumes of fluids are processed to achieve [[multiplexing]], automation, and [[high-throughput screening]]. Microfluidics emerged in the beginning of the 1980s and is used in the development of [[inkjet]] printheads, [[DNA chip]]s, [[lab-on-a-chip]] technology, micro-propulsion, and micro-thermal technologies.

Typically, '''micro''' means one of the following features:
* small volumes (μL, nL, pL, fL)
* small size
* low energy consumption
* effects of the microdomain

Typically in microfluidic systems fluids are transported, mixed, separated or otherwise processed. The various applications of such systems rely on passive fluid control using [[capillary force]]s. In some applications, external actuation means are additionally used for a directed transport of the media. Examples are rotary drives applying centrifugal forces for the fluid transport on the passive chips. '''Active microfluidics''' refers to the defined manipulation of the working fluid by active (micro) components such as [[micropump]]s or [[microvalve]]s. Micropumps supply fluids in a continuous manner or are used for dosing. Microvalves determine the flow direction or the mode of movement of pumped liquids. Often processes which are normally carried out in a lab are miniaturised on a single chip in order to enhance efficiency and mobility as well as reducing sample and reagent volumes.

==Microscale behaviour of fluids==

The behaviour of fluids at the microscale can differ from "macrofluidic" behaviour in that factors such as [[surface tension]], energy dissipation, and fluidic resistance start to dominate the system. Microfluidics studies how these behaviours change, and how they can be worked around, or exploited for new uses.&lt;ref&gt;S.C.Terry, J.H.Jerman and J.B.Angell:A Gas Chromatographic Air Analyzer Fabricated on a Silicon Wafer, IEEE Trans.Electron Devices, ED-26,12(1979)1880-1886.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;{{cite book | author=Kirby, B.J. | title=Micro- and Nanoscale Fluid Mechanics: Transport in Microfluidic Devices | url=http://www.kirbyresearch.com/textbook | year=2010 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karniadakis&gt;{{cite book | author=Karniadakis, G.M., Beskok, A., Aluru, N. | title=Microflows and Nanoflows | year=2005 | publisher =[[Springer Verlag]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruus&gt;{{cite book | author=Bruus, H. | title=Theoretical Microfluidics | year=2007 | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At small scales (channel size of around 100 [[nanometers]] to 500 [[micrometers]]) some interesting and sometimes unintuitive properties appear. In particular, the [[Reynolds number]] (which compares the effect of the momentum of a fluid to the effect of [[viscosity]]) can become very low. A key consequence is co-flowing fluids do not necessarily mix in the traditional sense, as flow becomes [[laminar flow|laminar]] rather than [[turbulent flow|turbulent]]; molecular transport between them must often be through [[diffusion]].&lt;ref name=Tabeling&gt;{{cite book | author=Tabeling, P. | title=Introduction to Microfluidics | year=2005 | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High specificity of chemical and physical properties (concentration, pH, temperature, shear force, etc.) can also be ensured resulting in more uniform reaction conditions and higher grade products in single and multi-step reactions.&lt;ref name="microreactors"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chokkalingam | first1 = V. | last2 = Weidenhof | first2 = B. | last3 = Kraemer | first3 = M. | last4 = Maier | first4 = W.

==Key application areas==

Microfluidic structures include micropneumatic systems, i.e. microsystems for the handling of off-chip fluids (liquid pumps, gas valves, etc.), and microfluidic structures for the on-chip handling of nanoliter (nl) and picoliter (pl) volumes.&lt;ref name=Nguyen&gt;{{cite book | author=Nguyen, N.T., Wereley, S. | title=Fundamentals and Applications of Microfluidics | year=2006 | publisher =[[Artech House]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, the most successful commercial application of microfluidics is the [[Inkjet printer|inkjet printhead]].&lt;ref name="microfluidics1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrew | year = 2006 | title = Control and detection of chemical reactions in microfluidic systems | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7101/full/nature05062.html | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = 7101| pages = 394–402 | doi = 10.1038/nature05062 |bibcode = 2006Natur.442..394D }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- and other industrially relevant materials (e.g., polymer particles).&lt;ref name="modular microfluidics"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = Wei | last2 = Greener | first2 = Jesse | last3 = Voicu | first3 = Dan | last4 = Kumacheva | first4 = Eugenia | year = 2009 | title = Multiple modular microfluidic (M3) reactors for the synthesis of polymer particles | url = http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/LC/article.asp?doi=b906626h | journal = Lab Chip | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 2715–2721 | doi = 10.1039/b906626h }}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;Additionally, advances in microfluidic manufacturing allow the devices to be produced in low-cost plastics&lt;ref name="researchgate.net"&gt;Ryan S.

Advances in microfluidics technology are revolutionizing [[molecular biology]] procedures for enzymatic analysis (e.g.,  [[glucose]] and [[lactic acid|lactate]] [[assay]]s), [[DNA]] analysis (e.g., [[polymerase chain reaction]] and high-throughput [[sequencing]]), and [[proteomics]]. The basic idea of microfluidic biochips is to integrate [[assay]] operations such as detection, as well as sample pre-treatment and sample preparation on one chip.&lt;ref name= Herold1&gt;{{cite book |author= Herold, KE; Rasooly, A (editor)| year=2009 |title=Lab-on-a-Chip Technology: Fabrication and Microfluidics | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-46-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Herold2&gt;{{cite book |author= Herold, KE; Rasooly, A (editor)| year=2009 |title=Lab-on-a-Chip Technology: Biomolecular Separation and Analysis | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-47-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An emerging application area for biochips is [[clinical pathology]], especially the immediate [[point-of-care]] diagnosis of [[diseases]]. In addition, microfluidics-based devices, capable of continuous sampling and real-time testing of air/water samples for biochemical [[toxins]] and other dangerous [[pathogens]], can serve as an always-on [[smoke alarm|"bio-smoke alarm"]] for early warning.

Microfluidic technology has led to the creation of powerful tools for biologists to control the complete cellular environment, leading to new questions and discoveries. Many diverse advantages of this technology for microbiology are listed below:
* General single cell studies including growth &lt;ref name="pmid20537537"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pubs.rsc.org"/&gt;

Some of these areas are further elaborated in the sections below.

=== [[Open microfluidics]] ===
In [[open microfluidics]], at least one boundary of the system is removed, exposing the fluid to air or another interface (i.e. liquid).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthier|first=Jean|last2=Brakke|first2=Kenneth A.|last3=Berthier|first3=Erwin|date=2016-08-01|title=Open Microfluidics|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781118720936|doi=10.1002/9781118720936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfohl|first=Thomas|last2=Mugele|first2=Frieder|last3=Seemann|first3=Ralf|last4=Herminghaus|first4=Stephan|date=2003-12-08|title=Trends in Microfluidics with Complex Fluids|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cphc.200300847|journal=ChemPhysChem|volume=4|issue=12|pages=1291–1298|doi=10.1002/cphc.200300847|issn=1439-4235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaigala|first=Govind V.|last2=Lovchik|first2=Robert D.|last3=Delamarche|first3=Emmanuel|date=2012-10-30|title=Microfluidics in the "Open Space" for Performing Localized Chemistry on Biological Interfaces|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201201798|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=51|issue=45|pages=11224–11240|doi=10.1002/anie.201201798|issn=1433-7851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages of open microfluidics include accessibility to the flowing liquid for intervention, larger liquid-gas surface area, and minimized bubble formation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=C.|last2=Boban|first2=M.|last3=Tuteja|first3=A.|date=2017|title=Open-channel, water-in-oil emulsification in paper-based microfluidic devices|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7lc00114b|journal=Lab on a Chip|volume=17|issue=8|pages=1436–1441|doi=10.1039/c7lc00114b|issn=1473-0197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another advantage of open microfluidics is the ability to integrate open systems with surface-tension driven fluid flow, which eliminates the need for external pumping methods such as peristaltic or syringe pumps.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casavant|first=B.

===Continuous-flow microfluidics===

These technologies are based on the manipulation of continuous [[steady flow|liquid flow]] through microfabricated channels. Actuation of [[steady flow|liquid flow]] is implemented either by external [[pressure]] sources, external mechanical [[pump]]s, integrated mechanical [[micropump]]s, or by combinations of capillary forces and [[electrokinetic]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite book | author=Chang, H.C., Yeo, Leslie | title=Electrokinetically Driven Microfluidics and Nanofluidics | year=2009 | publisher =[[Cambridge University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cytonix.com/fluid%20transistor.html fluid transistor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708215908/http://www.cytonix.com/fluid%20transistor.html |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Continuous-flow microfluidic operation is the mainstream approach because it is easy to implement and less sensitive to protein fouling problems. Continuous-flow devices are adequate for many well-defined and simple biochemical applications, and for certain tasks such as chemical separation, but they are less suitable for tasks requiring a high degree of flexibility or fluid manipulations. These closed-channel systems are inherently difficult to integrate and scale because the parameters that govern flow field vary along the flow path making the fluid flow at any one location dependent on the properties of the entire system. Permanently etched microstructures also lead to limited reconfigurability and poor fault tolerance capability. Computer-aided design automation approaches for continuous-flow microfluidics have been proposed in recent years to alleviate the design effort and to solve the scalability problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8060543/ Columba 2.0: A co-layout synthesis tool for continuous-flow microfluidic biochips]&lt;/ref&gt;

Process monitoring capabilities in continuous-flow systems can be achieved with highly sensitive microfluidic flow sensors based on [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] technology which offers resolutions down to the nanoliter range.

{{Main|Droplet-based microfluidics}}
Droplet-based microfluidics is a subcategory of microfluidics in contrast with continuous microfluidics; droplet-based microfluidics manipulates discrete volumes of fluids in immiscible phases with low Reynolds number and laminar flow regimes. Interest in droplet-based microfluidics systems has been growing substantially in past decades. Microdroplets allow for handling miniature volumes (μl to fl) of fluids conveniently, provide better mixing, encapsulation, sorting, and sensing, and suit high throughput experiments.&lt;ref name="pubs.rsc.org"&gt;Venkat Chokkalingam, Jurjen Tel, Florian Wimmers, Xin Liu, Sergey Semenov, Julian Thiele, Carl G.

===Digital microfluidics===

Alternatives to the above closed-channel continuous-flow systems include novel open structures, where discrete, independently controllable droplets
are manipulated on a substrate using [[electrowetting]]. Following the analogy of digital microelectronics, this approach is referred to as [[digital microfluidics]]. Le Pesant et al. pioneered the use of electrocapillary forces to move droplets on a digital track.&lt;ref&gt;Le Pesant et al., Electrodes for a device operating by electrically controlled fluid displacement, U.S. Pat. No. 4,569,575, Feb. 11, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The "fluid transistor" pioneered by Cytonix&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/piSearch.do;jsessionid=D05E82394F781CBA17DB0C5AC8E3C0B8?SearchType=piSearch&amp;page=1&amp;QueryText=&amp;PIFirstName=james&amp;PILastName=brown&amp;PIInstitution=cytonix&amp;PIState=MD&amp;PIZip=&amp;PICountry=US&amp;RestrictExpired=on&amp;Search=Search#results NSF Award Search: Advanced Search Results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; also played a role. The technology was subsequently commercialised by Duke University.

This "digitisation" method facilitates the use of a hierarchical and cell-based approach for microfluidic biochip design. Therefore, digital microfluidics offers a flexible and scalable system architecture as well as high [[fault-tolerance]] capability. Moreover, because each droplet can be controlled independently, these systems also have dynamic reconfigurability, whereby groups of unit cells in a microfluidic array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. Although droplets are manipulated in confined microfluidic channels, since the control on droplets is not independent, it should not be confused as "digital microfluidics". One common actuation method for digital microfluidics is [[electrowetting]]-on-dielectric ([[EWOD]]). Many lab-on-a-chip applications have been demonstrated within the digital microfluidics paradigm using electrowetting. However, recently other techniques for droplet manipulation have also been demonstrated using magnetic force&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Yi, and Nam-Trung Nguyen. "Magnetic digital microfluidics–a review."

=== Paper-based microfluidics ===
{{Main|Paper-based microfluidics}}
Paper-based microfluidic devices fill a growing niche for portable, cheap, and user-friendly medical diagnostic systems.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118720936.ch7/summary|title=Open Microfluidics|last=Berthier|first=Jean|last2=Brakke|first2=Kenneth A.|last3=Berthier|first3=Erwin|date=2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118720936|pages=229–256|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118720936.ch7/summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Paper based microfluidics rely on the phenomenon of capillary penetration in porous media. In order to tune fluid penetration in porous substrates such as paper, in two and three dimensions, the pore structure, wettability and geometry of the microfluidic devices can be controlled while the viscosity and evaporation rate of the liquid play a further significant role. Many such devices feature hydrophobic barriers on hydrophilic paper that passively transport aqueous solutions to outlets where biological reactions take place.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YQlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Microfabrication+Techniques+for+Microfluidic+Devices+Silverio&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VqRTqXbUAg&amp;sig=PXE1ieRaqVO7HjaREaETskPkwzg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK4JqgzZTZAhVszFQKHR0QDi4Q6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Microfabrication%20Techniques%20for%20Microfluidic%20Devices%20Silverio&amp;f=false|title=Complex Fluid-Flows in Microfluidics|last=Galindo-Rosales|first=Francisco José|date=2017-05-26|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319595931|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current applications include portable glucose detection&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Andres W.|last2=Phillips|first2=Scott T.|last3=Butte|first3=Manish J.|last4=Whitesides|first4=George M.|date=2007|title=Patterned paper as a platform for inexpensive, low-volume, portable bioassays|journal=Angewandte Chemie (International Ed. in English)|volume=46|issue=8|pages=1318–1320|doi=10.1002/anie.200603817|issn=1433-7851|pmc=3804133|pmid=17211899}}&lt;/ref&gt; and environmental testing,&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271508549_Smartphone_Detection_of_Escherichia_coli_From_Field_Water_Samples_on_Paper_Microfluidics|title=Smartphone Detection of Escherichia coli From Field Water Samples on Paper Microfluidics|last=Park|first=Tu San|last2=Yoon|first2=Jeong-Yeol|date=2015-03-01|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with hopes of reaching areas that lack advanced medical diagnostic tools.

===DNA chips (microarrays)===

Early biochips were based on the idea of a [[DNA microarray]], e.g., the GeneChip DNAarray from [[Affymetrix]], which is a piece of glass, plastic or silicon substrate, on which pieces of DNA (probes) are affixed in a microscopic array. Similar to a [[DNA microarray]], a [[protein array]] is a miniature array where a multitude of different capture agents, most frequently monoclonal [[antibodies]], are deposited on a chip surface; they are used to determine the presence and/or amount of [[protein]]s in biological samples, e.g., [[blood]]. A drawback of [[DNA]] and [[protein array]]s is that they are neither reconfigurable nor [[scalable]] after manufacture. [[Digital microfluidics]] has been described as a means for carrying out [[Digital PCR]].

===Molecular biology===
In addition to microarrays, biochips have been designed for two-dimensional [[electrophoresis]],&lt;ref name= Fan&gt;{{cite book |author= Fan|year=2009|chapter=Two-Dimensional Electrophoresis in a Chip|title=Lab-on-a-Chip Technology: Biomolecular Separation and Analysis|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-47-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[transcriptome]] analysis,&lt;ref name= BontouxN&gt;{{cite book |author= Bontoux|year=2009|chapter=Elaborating Lab-on-a-Chips for Single-cell Transcriptome Analysis|title=Lab-on-a-Chip Technology: Biomolecular Separation and Analysis|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-47-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PCR]] amplification.&lt;ref name= Cadync&gt;{{cite book |author= Cady, NC|year=2009|chapter=Microchip-based PCR Amplification Systems|title=Lab-on-a-Chip Technology: Biomolecular Separation and Analysis|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-47-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other applications include various electrophoresis and [[liquid chromatography]] applications for proteins and [[DNA]], cell separation, in particular, blood cell separation, protein analysis, cell manipulation and analysis including cell viability analysis &lt;ref name="pubs.rsc.org"/&gt; and [[microorganism]] capturing.&lt;ref name="Herold2"/&gt;

===Evolutionary biology===

By combining microfluidics with [[landscape ecology]] and [[nanofluidics]], a nano/micro fabricated fluidic landscape can be constructed by building local patches of [[bacterial]] [[habitat]] and connecting them by dispersal corridors. The resulting landscapes can be used as physical implementations of an [[adaptive landscape]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Keymer J.E. |author2=P. Galajda |author3=C. Muldoon R. |author4=R. Austin  |last-author-amp=yes |date=November 2006 |title=Bacterial metapopulations in nanofabricated landscapes|journal=PNAS |volume=103 |issue=46 |pages= 17290–295 |pmc= 1635019|doi=10.1073/pnas.0607971103  |bibcode = 2006PNAS..10317290K |pmid=17090676}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by generating a spatial mosaic of patches of opportunity distributed in space and time. The patchy nature of these fluidic landscapes allows for the study of adapting bacterial cells in a [[metapopulation]] system. The [[evolutionary ecology]] of these bacterial systems in these synthetic ecosystems allows for using [[biophysics]] to address questions in [[evolutionary biology]].

===Cell behavior===
{{Main|Microfluidic cell culture}}
The ability to create precise and carefully controlled [[chemoattractant]] gradients makes microfluidics the ideal tool to study motility, [[chemotaxis]] and the ability to evolve / develop resistance to antibiotics in small populations of microorganisms and in a short period of time. These microorganisms including [[bacteria]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = T. | last2 = Shimizu | first2 = T.S. | last3 = Stocker | first3 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Microfluidics for bacterial chemotaxis | url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2010/ib/c0ib00049c | journal = Integrative Biology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 604–629 | doi = 10.1039/C0IB00049C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the broad range of organisms that form the marine [[microbial loop]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seymour | first1 = J.R. | last2 = Simo' | first2 = R. | last3 = Ahmed | first3 = T. | last4 = Stocker | first4 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Chemoattraction to dimethylsulfoniopropionate throughout the marine microbial food web | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5989/342.abstract?sid=b60ccea5-d8be-412f-a9c9-fcd5cdd77ea9 | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5989| pages = 342–345 | doi = 10.1126/science.1188418 |bibcode = 2010Sci...329..342S | pmid=20647471}}&lt;/ref&gt; responsible for regulating much of the oceans' biogeochemistry.

Microfluidics has also greatly aided the study of [[durotaxis]] by facilitating the creation of durotactic (stiffness) gradients.

===Optics===
The merger of microfluidics and optics is typical known as [[optofluidics]]. Examples of optofluidic devices are tunable microlens arrays&lt;ref&gt;Liquid micro-lens array activated by selective electrowetting on lithium niobate substrates S. Grilli, L. Miccio, V. Vespini, A.

===Acoustic droplet ejection (ADE)===

[[Acoustic droplet ejection]] uses a pulse of [[ultrasound]] to move low volumes of [[fluids]] (typically nanoliters or picoliters) without any physical contact. This technology focuses acoustic energy into a fluid sample in order to eject droplets as small as a millionth of a millionth of a litre (picoliter = 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; litre). ADE technology is a very gentle process, and it can be used to transfer proteins, high molecular weight DNA and live cells without damage or loss of viability. This feature makes the technology suitable for a wide variety of applications including [[proteomics]] and cell-based assays.

===Fuel cells===
{{Details|Electroosmotic pump}}
Microfluidic [[fuel cells]] can use laminar flow to separate the fuel and its oxidant to control the interaction of the two fluids without a physical barrier as would be required in conventional fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://microfluidics.stanford.edu/fuel_cells.htm Water Management in PEM Fuel Cells]   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628192632/http://microfluidics.stanford.edu/fuel_cells.htm |date=June 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200505/fuel.cfm Building a Better Fuel Cell Using Microfluidics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080305215325/http://www.me.mtu.edu/mnit/ Fuel Cell Initiative at MnIT Microfluidics Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Domestic robot|household robot]] '''Modulus''', described by the manufacturer as "the friend of ''Homo sapiens''", was made by Sirius, a company Massimo Giuliana set up in 1982 for marketing home and [[personal computer]]s, and which decided to start building its own domestic robot back in 1984. When the first "Modulus" prototype had been realized, the company asked Isao Hosoe, a Japanese designer who has been living and working in [[Milan]] for many years, to study its "body-work". Hosoe's work, however, went well beyond this, and was followed by a complete technological reprocessing of the robot. Data Process was responsible for the design and manufacture of the electronic and mechanical parts, while Sirius used the expertise of an American company, the RB Robot Corporation, for the software (its founder, Joseph H. Bosworth, is known by some as "the father of personal robotics").

==Development==
Two million dollars were invested in developing this particular piece of equipment. Research carried out in the United States showed that there would be greater development in this sector. It was also estimated that the use of "Modulus" could provide an opportunity to bring back into operation many PCs that were bought during the boom, but which are not used seldom, if ever. A good slice of the "Modulus" market could consist of the owners of these personal computers, newly aware of the possibility of connecting them to a personal robot.

"Modulus" was designed as a robot with possible domestic applications, but in reality it is open to any future development. Modularity - hence its name - is one of its principal characteristics, and it has been designed for adaptation to the widest possible range of applications. Comparing the robot with man, "Modulus" can be said to have an electronic "[[circulatory system]]" that permits the various extremities (arms, head, etc.) to communicate with the brain (CPU in a computer). The "Modulus" robots could have abilities such as a [[phoneme]]s synthesizer, [[Speaker recognition|voice recognition]], [[infrared]] communication, etc., making it suitable for performing many functions ranging from helping to teach children to assisting the handicapped or invalids.

When studying the eventual appearance of "Modulus", Isao Hosoe began by looking at the robots of the past. These included "Electro", built by Westinghouse in 1939. Hosoe hit on the right appearance by studying human expressions and gestures, bearing in mind that a domestic robot needs to be appealing on account of its proximity to man. Its eyelids have to open, its pupils dilate or contract. It must be able to nod or shake its head, bend its torso, and raise, lower and rotate its arms. "Modulus", however, has no feet. Available in three configurations - "Base", "Service &amp; Security" and "Moddy" - "Modulus" stands on a Base unit 35&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and 15&amp;nbsp;cm high, two two-speed motors connected to rubber wheels, and two spherical stabilizers. It comes with a small infrared Instrument for connecting it to another [[remote control]] device or for interacting with the major home and personal computers.

== Base ==
[[File:Modulus - Base.JPG|thumb|The Base version of the Modulus robot.]]
This first unit can be added to for different functions. As it stands it can be used in hobbies as a [[home computer]], self-propelled peripheral, and can be useful for people wanting to learn to program robots. The simplest attachments which can be connected to the Base unit are a [[vacuum cleaner]] and a plotter-mechanism that uses felt pens, etc., to produce drawings of considerable precision.

== Service &amp; Security ==
[[File:Modulus - Service &amp; Security.jpg|thumb|The Service &amp; Security version of the Modulus robot.]]
The second "Modulus" configuration, the Service Robot, is obtained by fitting the Techno-cake home-security and service unit on to the Base. One of the components allow the robot to signal the presence of smoke, gas, water, and intruders; at the first sign of danger it informs the computer or triggers a siren or preset vocal message. An arm with ample freedom of movement and considerable gripping power can be added to the Service Robot. Using its meteo-system, the robot will fetch its owners umbrella if it is going to rain; a simple whistle will bring it toddling over to you.

== Moddy ==

Moddy is the third and most advanced version of the robot. It is obtained by adding a torso, two arms, and a head to the other two units. The robot can carry a tray with its two arms. Its head and big eyes make it into a really human character, reliable, and a companion to play with. It is not surprising then if Isao Hosoe, who designed "Modulus" together with Ann Marinelli, Donato Greco, and Alessio Pozzoli, also received special advice from his two children, ten-year-old Takeo and fifteen-year-old Taro.

The first two units were previously available on the market. Base complete with vacuum cleaner and plotter-mechanism cost about a million lire, while the price of the Techno-Cake varied from two to five million lire, depending on the type and number of components in function (not all the components were available yet, on account of the time needed to develop the software). It would probably take up to a year before Moddy was ready, which would cost between eight and ten million lire, but unfortunately the "Modulus" project became too expensive, causing the bankruptcy of Sirius before Moddy could be completed. Some of the robots were later sold to companies who distributed them for the aid of handicapped while many of the Moddy robots were later sold by Arngren Electronics A/S during the early 1990s.

The '''Namibia Food and Allied Workers Union''' (Nafau) is a trade union in [[Namibia]] affiliated with the [[National Union of Namibian Workers]] (Nunw). Nafau's organizational strongholds include the fishing industries around [[Walvis Bay]] and [[Lüderitz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com.na/content/view/886/45/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208013517/http://www.economist.com.na/content/view/886/45/ |date=2012-02-08 }} [[Namibia Economist]] - Nafau says sharing information can avoid conflict&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nafau was founded on 20 September 1986. Originally led by recently released political prisoner [[John Pandeni]], the Union was the first NUNW-affiliated industrial union in Namibia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nunw.org.na/nafau.htm National Union of Namibian Workers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Offsite construction''' refers to the planning, design, fabrication, and assembly of building elements at a location other than their final installed location to support the rapid and efficient construction of a permanent structure.  Such building elements may be prefabricated in a different location and transported to the site or prefabricated on the construction site and then transported to their final location.  Offsite construction is characterized by an integrated planning and supply chain optimization strategy.  Offsite manufacturing (OSM), offsite production (OSP) and offsite fabrication (OSF) are used when referring primarily to the factory work proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan|title=Offsite Architecture|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon and New York|isbn=978-1-138-82137-8|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building configurations ==
Off-site construction (like on-site construction) can be used for a variety of purposes including residential, educational, health care and commercial applications. Buildings can range from a few modular units to several hundred. They can be arranged in architectural configurations and can be many stories in height.
== Similarities ==
Off-site construction is similar to [[modular building|modular construction]], but it is focused primarily on permanent construction; modular construction can be either permanent or relocatable. Also known as offsite construction, or OSC, and also incorporates many MMC - or Modern Methods of Construction

A '''pocket video camera''' is a [[tapeless camcorder]] that is small enough to be carried in one's pocket. 

A typical pocket video camera has an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD screen]] of at least 1.5", the ability to capture either only standard video or both standard video and [[high-definition video]] ([[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]]), at least 128MB of internal memory and a [[Secure Digital]] (SD) card extension or at least 4GB internal memory with no SD card slot. Power may be supplied by a proprietary Ni-MH [[rechargeable battery]] or 2 standard AA batteries. Dimensions 2.5 x 4.5 x 0.9 in and a weight of 3.8 oz are typical, and a [[USB]] connector is usually built-in.

Pocket camcorders weigh only from 0.2 to 0.4 lbs and fit neatly into any pocket or purse for ultra portability. Examples include the [[Creative Vado HD]] and the [[Flip Video]]. The [[Sony Bloggie MHS-PM5]] can shoot video in Full HD and has 4x [[digital zoom]].&lt;ref&gt;http://camcorders.about.com/od/reviews/fr/sony_bloggie_HMS_PM5_camcorder_review.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanyo Xacti PD1 can shoot video in Full HD 1080p at 30fps, with Stereo audio and has 3x optical zoom.&lt;ref&gt;LetsGoDigital - Sanyo Xacti PD1 http://www.letsgodigital.org/printerfriendly.php?id=27061&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project MERRIMAC''' was a domestic espionage operation coordinated under the Office of Security of the [[CIA]]. It involved information gathering procedures via infiltration and surveillance on Washington-based anti-war groups that might pose potential threats to the CIA. However, the type of data gathered also included general information on the infrastructure of targeted communities. Project MERRIMAC and its twin program, [[Project RESISTANCE]] were both coordinated by the CIA Office of Security. In addition, the twin projects were branch operations that relayed civilian information to their parent program, [[Operation CHAOS]].  The Assassination Archives and Research Center believes that Project MERRIMAC began in February 1967.

'''Robert Vallée''' (5 October 1922 in [[Poitiers]], France – 1 January 2017, Paris, France) was a French [[cyberneticist]] and mathematician. He was Professor at the [[Paris 13 University]] (University of Paris-Nord) and president of the World Organization of Systems and Cybernetics (WOSC),.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybsoc.org/wosc/ World Organisation of Systems and Cybernetics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Vallée has passed away|url=http://wosc.co/2017/01/03/robert-vallee-has-passed/|publisher=World Organisation of Systems and Cybernatics|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 1950s, Vallée wrote his first publications on what he named "opérateur d'observation" (which means in English "operator of observation"). The latter, in the simplest case, allows a cybernetic [[system]] to observe the state of its environment and itself. Thereafter, on the basis of these results, a decisional operator will be able to indicate the action to be taken. The two stages of [[perception]] and [[Decision making|decision]] are distinguished by "intellectual convenience",&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Robert Vallée, ''Cognition et système'', l'Interdisciplinaire, Lyon-Limonest, 1995, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is interesting to gather them in a unique operator, known as "[[pragmatism|pragmatic]]". A decision is influenced by the observation of events, but also by past perceptions. That means that, in the observation made at a given moment, traces of past observations are also present. Eventually, these processes follow one another in a loop. Vallée defined the study of this situation with the term "epistemo-praxeology", underlining the existing link between knowledge (episteme), resulting from [[observation]], and [[action (philosophy)|action]] (praxis). Regarding the observation problem, Vallée was also interested in [[information theory]].

Vallée also nourished private interests in [[sociology|sociological]] problems as well as in history. The first led him to describe a [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] creature covering the whole surface of the globe with its [[communication theory|communication]] net (1952), an idea which has also been proposed (under the name of "cybionte", 1975) by [[Joël de Rosnay]]. He also wrote articles devoted to historical aspects of cybernetics and systems, referring to [[René Descartes]], [[Louis de Broglie]], and [[Norbert Wiener]].

==Biography==
Vallée was born on 5 October 1922, in [[Poitiers]], (France), as the son of professors in history. In 1969 he married the editor and translator Nicole Georges-Lévy. With his wife, Robert Vallée contributed to a translation, in French, of Norbert Wiener's book, ''Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine''.

Towards the end of the 1920s and during the 1930s, Vallée attended the College of [[Angoulême]] where, in 1940, he obtained a bachelor's degree in [[Latin]]-[[Greek language|Greek]], mathematics, and philosophy. Between 1944 and 1946, he was student at the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris. During the summer of 1954, he took part in the "Foreign Students Summer Project" of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (with [[Norbert Wiener]] and Armand Siegel). In 1961 he became a [[Doctor of Science]] in mathematics with a thesis on an extension of the [[Kaluza–Klein theory|general relativity of Kaluza-Klein]], under the direction of [[André Lichnerowicz]] ([[University of Paris]]).

During his career, Vallée occupied several positions. Between 1956 and 1958, he was Associate-Director of the Institute Blaise Pascal in Paris. From 1961 to 1971, he was university lecturer in mathematics at the [[École Polytechnique]] and at the [[University of Franche-Comté]] (1962–1971) where he subsequently became Professor. Between 1971 and 1987 he was Professor at the University of Paris-Nord where he was also [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the [[Faculty (teaching staff)|Faculty]] of Economics from 1973 to 1975 and president of the Department of [[Economical mathematics]] from 1975 to 1987. In 1987, the University of Paris-Nord conferred on him the title of [[Professor Emeritus]]. Vallée also gave a doctoral course on [[dynamic systems]] at the [[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne]] between 1975 and 1987.

Vallée was active within several associations and organizations, in particular:

* Founder of the Cercle d’Etudes Cybernétiques (President [[Louis de Broglie]]), 1950.
* Member of the Council of the [[Société Mathématique de France]], 1964–1967.
* General Director of the Institut de Sciences Mathématiques et Economiques Appliquées (President [[François Perroux]]), 1980–1982.
* President of the Collège de Systémique de l'Association Française pour la Cybernétique Economique et Technique (AFCET), 1981–1984.
* Member of the council of the French Association of Theoretical Biology, 1984–1988.
* Representative of the AFCET, (later CET), at the International Federation for Systems Research (IFSR), 1986.
* Participant in several Fuschl Conversations (International Systems Institute and IFSR), 1986–1996.
* General Director (1987) then President (2003) of the World Organization of Systems and Cybernetics (WOSC, founder J. Rose), 1987.
* Member of the council of the International Association of Cybernetics, 1987–2000. Member of the council of the Association Française de Science des Systèmes Cybernétiques, Cognitifs, et Techniques (AFSCET), 1999.

He also was a member of the International Society for the Systems Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;[http://isss.org/world/index.php International Society for the Systems Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt; the American Society for Cybernetic,s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asc-cybernetics.org/ American Society for Cybernetics]&lt;/ref&gt; the Tutmonda Asocio pri Kibernetiko, Informatiko kaj Sistemiko (TAKIS), and of the international league of scientists for the use of the French language.&lt;ref&gt;Website of the [http://www.lisulf.qc.ca/ international league of scientists for the use of the French language] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scented water''', [[odoriferous]] water&lt;ref name="Baer43"&gt;Baer, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; or sweet water,&lt;ref&gt;Ponce de León, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gallowglass.org"&gt;[http://www.gallowglass.org/jadwiga/herbs/oil&amp;water.html Making Medieval Style Scented Oils &amp; Waters]&lt;/ref&gt; is a water with a sweet [[aromatic]] smell.&lt;ref&gt;Tietz, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of flowers or herbs and is the precursor of the modern day perfume.&lt;ref name="middleagescents"&gt;[http://www.gallowglass.org/jadwiga/herbs/scents.html Scents of the Middle Ages]&lt;/ref&gt; Scented waters are also used in making other products such as [[pomander]]s and body care products.&lt;ref name="gallowglass.org"/&gt;

== Ingredients ==
Some of the flowers and herbs used to make scented water are:

* [[jasmine]]&lt;ref name="middleagescents"/&gt;  Largely used in Indonesia for charmed bath. Also used to cleanse a curse from another shaman or demon. 
* [[lemon]]&lt;ref name="middleagescents"/&gt; 
* [[lavender]] – from the Latin word ''lavare'', meaning to wash.&lt;ref&gt;Phaneuf, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Myrtus|myrtle]] – one of the original types.&lt;ref name="middleagescents"/&gt;
* [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] [[blossom]]s – one of the best known waters. [[Orange flower water]] is also used in various cuisines, to flavor desserts and to mask the taste of [[hard water]].&lt;ref name="middleagescents"/&gt;
* [[rose]]s – distilled are used in cosmetics. [[Rose water]], a byproduct of traditional [[rose oil]] production, is prominently used in desserts in [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] and [[North Indian cuisine]].&lt;ref name="Gladstar123"&gt;Gladstar, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[rosemary]] – believed to refuse to grow in flower gardens of evil people.&lt;ref&gt;Books, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hygiene ==

In Medieval times a scented water was used for hygiene by a person washing their hands with it before meals, since many meals were forkless.&lt;ref name="Adamson161"&gt;Adamson, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bober, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dmorton.ca/blog/2009/04/food-in-the-middle-ages/ Food in the Middle Ages: Eight Things You Probably Didn’t Know]&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthy of Medieval times had their linen clothes boiled in scented water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cookit.e2bn.org/historycookbook/27-316-normans-medieval-Health-facts.html Normans / Medieval]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varahamihira]] (6th century) was using scented water to clean his toothbrushes.&lt;ref&gt;Donkin, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Just prior to [[Marie Antoinette]]'s execution in 1793 one of her servants was able to smuggle her some minimal need requests, one being some scented water for her teeth.&lt;ref&gt;Feydeau, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical ===

[[Hippocrates]] mentions scented water in his medical practice:
{{cquote|
''Then dipping (BAPTW) into oil of roses or Egyptian oil, apply it through the day, and, as soon as it stings, take it away, and baptize (BAPTIDZO) it, again, into woman's milk and Egyptian oil, and apply during the night and rinse with sweet scented water and apply tallow.'' Hippocrates , ii, 710&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.living-hope-press.com/BAPTIDZO-Envelopment-for-Influence.html History of Baptism]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Washing waters ===
[[Boccaccio]] in his [[Decameron]] mentions scented washing waters:
{{cquote| 
''Without permitting anyone else to lay a hand on him, the lady herself washed Salabaetto all over with soap scented with musk and cloves. She then had herself washed and rubbed down by the slaves. This done, the slaves brought two fine and very white sheets, so scented with roses that they seemed like roses; the slaves wrapped Salabaetto in one and the lady in the other and then carried them both on their shoulders to the bed... They then took from the basket silver vases of great beauty, some of which were filled with rose water, some with orange water, some with jasmine water, and some with lemon water, which they sprinkled upon them.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://rosaliegilbert.com/cleanliness.html Bathing and cleansing of the medieval woman]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://calontir.info/artsci/calonscrolls/Calon_Scrolls_Jan_08_Home.pdf Beauty Aids in Renaissance Italy, page 6]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Refreshment ==

It was a custom in the [[Roman Empire]] for [[amphitheatre]]s to be furnished with scented water jet fountain sprays for refreshing the spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Langmead, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Papillon200"&gt;Papillon, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuniczak, p. 452 ''High in the rear were sprinklers to cool the spectators and mists of saffon and verbena water.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, p. 86 ''...and fountains poured forth jets of perfumed water.

Nero, 31.'' footnote 2: ''It appears to have been the custom, under the Empire, for all theatres and other places of amusement to be provided with perfumed fountains and concealed jets for cooling the air with a fine spray of scented water.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (1898) [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0062:entry=amphitheatrum-harpers&amp;highlight=scented Amphitheātrum] ''There were in the amphitheatre concealed tubes, from which scented liquids were scattered over the audience, and which sometimes issued from statues placed in different parts of the building.'' (Lucan, ix. 808; Spect. 3.)&lt;/ref&gt; The overhead awning ([[velarium]]) shielding the spectators for the [[Colosseum]] was saturated with scented water for dripping fragrant water on spectators' heads to keep them cool.&lt;ref&gt;Papillon, p. 200   ''The awning shielding the amphitheatre was saturated with scented water which dripped, like a fragrant rain, on the spectators' heads.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DICTIONARY OF GREEK AND ROMAN ANTIQUITIES, p. 53 ''There were in the amphitheatres concealed tubes, from which scented liquids were scattered over the audience...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Amphitheatrum.html Amphitheatrum]

The space required for the working of the velarium, and the height necessary for keeping it from bending down by its own weight so low as to obstruct the view from the upper benches, are probably the reasons for the great disproportion between the height of the upper part of the amphitheatre, and the small number of spectators accommodated in that part. The luxurious appliances of fountains of scented water to refresh the spectators, and so forth, are sufficiently described in the passage already quoted from Gibbon (cf. Lucan IX.808).º''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perfume ==

[[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland]] in 1511-12 had various scented waters made for him, which consisted of his usage of over a gallon each week for the year.&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1571 estate inventory of John Brodocke, an apothecary in [[Southampton]], lists 32 types of scented water that he had as some of the items in his shop.&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In 17th century [[Constantinople]] the Venetians and Genoese had apothecary shops that had merchants of scented water including rose water.&lt;ref&gt;Donkin, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Scented waters were still being used into the 19th century of the wealthy nobles in Egypt as a type of perfume. It was an Egyptian custom then to sprinkle guests with rose water or orange-flower water after dinner just before they were to go home.&lt;ref name="Baer43"/&gt;

Even though it is said by scholars that the art of perfumery has it roots in antiquity, the city of [[Montpellier]] has self established itself as the birthplace of [[perfumery]]. In the 18th century they honored guests of the city with scented water and other 'gifts of fragrance'. There are even perfume manuals that describe Montpellier perfumes as being "a la mode de Montpellier" because of extra ingredients used that enhance their fragrances.&lt;ref&gt;Feydeau, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooking ==
Scented rose water is and has been used from time to time for cooking and flavoring foods in various recipes.&lt;ref&gt;Lyttelton, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Rose water is used in Greek cuisine.&lt;ref name="Gladstar123"/&gt;

== Sensual ==

In Medieval times scented water was used for sensual pleasures.&lt;ref name="Adamson161"/&gt;

== Religious ==
In Medieval times scented water was used at baptisms.&lt;ref&gt;Lyttelton, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formulas ==

=== Rose water ===
Mary Hooper in her book called ''Petals in the Ashes'' about the [[Great Fire of 1666]] explains that the first step in making "rose water" is to gather together 3 or 4 full roses. These roses should not have been treated in any way with toxic pesticide for obvious reasons. One is to then take a pint of water and put into a [[saucepan]]. Then heat the water with the roses in it gently, not allowing it to boil. You are to cook the rose petals until they become transparent. After that happens, allow the cooked rose water to cool. Then drain through a [[sieve]] forcing the water to go through the rose petals. The resulting "rose water" is to be refrigerated. The scented water then is used as a cooling agent on the body as well as the face.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scented bath water ===
Hooper explains that scented water to bathe in can be made of dried herbs.  She explains the idea of making such a scented water is to put 8 tablespoons of dried herbs in a pan of 1 pint of water and simmer for 10 minutes. This water then is to be allowed to cool. Then it is to be strained to remove all the herb pieces. For the actual bath then a quarter of this scented water is to be put into your bath, highlighted with fresh flower petals on top of the bath water. She explains [[rose]]s and [[lovage]] have a cleansing and deodorising effect. For a refreshing effect she recommends to use rosemary and [[hyssop]].  For a relaxing effect to use [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] flowers and [[lavender]]. For a soothing effect use [[chamomile]] and [[lemon balm]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2053">[[Image:Drainwave Sewer Dosing Unit.jpg|thumb|right|Drainwave sewer dosing unit]]
A '''sewer dosing unit''' (SDU) is a plumbing device to allow effective sewage disposal with low liquid-flow rates. With a global emphasis on water saving, many new buildings and renovations are seeing the installation of water saving fixtures such as low flow shower heads and [[low flush toilet]]s. With the decrease in wastewater flows problems are arising from waste solids not being carried completely to the main sewers, often causing blockages.

==History==

*2006 – Ducane R&amp;D Pty Ltd conceived the idea of a device that can store wastewater and release it in large batches to replace the drain clearing action of large volume toilet flushes.
*2010 – After much prototyping and development the devices are offered for sale in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom under the name [http://www.drainwave.com.au Drainwave].

==Performance==

Independent testing has shown that the use of an SDU allows for the use of low flush toilets using as little as 0.8 L to push general waste solids more than 25 metres along a typical wastewater drainpipe. 
An advantage of the SDU is that it can use more than just the toilet wastewater to keep drains clear of blockages.

[[File:Large Outdoor Concert.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Large outdoor [[pop music]] concerts use complex and powerful sound reinforcement systems.]]
A '''sound reinforcement system''' is the combination of [[microphone]]s, [[signal processor]]s, [[amplifier]]s, and [[loudspeaker]]s in [[Loudspeaker enclosure|enclosures]] all controlled by a [[mixing console]] that makes live or pre-recorded sounds louder and may also distribute those sounds to a larger or more distant audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Davis | first1 = Gary | first2 = Ralph | last2 = Jones | title = Sound Reinforcement Handbook | edition = 2nd | location = Milwaukee | publisher = Hal Leonard Corporation | year = 1989 | page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Eargle|Foreman|2002| p=299}} In many situations, a sound reinforcement system is also used to enhance or alter the sound of the sources on the stage, typically by using [[effects unit|electronic effects]], such as [[reverb]], as opposed to simply amplifying the sources unaltered.

A sound reinforcement system for a [[rock concert]] in a stadium may be very complex, including hundreds of microphones, complex [[live sound mixing]] and signal processing systems, tens of thousands of [[watt]]s of [[Audio power amplifier|amplifier]] power, and multiple [[Line array|loudspeaker arrays]], all overseen by a team of [[audio engineer]]s and technicians. On the other hand, a sound reinforcement system can be as simple as a small [[public address]] (PA) system, consisting of, for example, a single microphone connected to a 100 watt [[amplified loudspeaker]] for a singer-guitarist playing in a small [[coffeehouse]].  In both cases, these systems ''reinforce'' sound to make it louder or distribute it to a wider audience.{{sfn |Eargle|Foreman|2002| p=167}}

Some audio engineers and others in the [[professional audio]] industry disagree over whether these audio systems should be called sound reinforcement (SR) systems or PA systems.  Distinguishing between the two terms by technology and capability is common, while others distinguish by intended use (e.g., SR systems are for [[live event support]] and PA systems are for reproduction of speech and recorded music in buildings and institutions).  In some regions or markets, the distinction between the two terms is important, though the terms are considered interchangeable in many professional circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author-last=Borgerson |author-first=Bruce |url=http://svconline.com/mag/avinstall_pa_sr/index.html |title=Is it P.A. or SR? |work=Sound &amp; Video Contractor |date=1 November 2003 |publisher=Prism Business Media |access-date=18 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201080113/http://svconline.com/mag/avinstall_pa_sr/index.html |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concept==
[[Image:Basic PA.svg|thumb|right|300px|A basic sound reinforcement system that would be used in a small music venue. The main [[loudspeaker]]s for the audience are to the left and right of the stage. A row of [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speakers]] pointing towards the onstage performers helps them hear their singing and playing. The audio engineer sits at the back of the room, operating the [[mixing console]], which shapes the sound and volume of all of the voices and instruments.]]

A typical sound reinforcement system consists of; input [[transducer]]s (e.g., [[microphone]]s), which convert [[sound energy]] such as a person [[singing]] into an electric signal, [[Audio signal processing|signal processors]] which alter the signal characteristics (e.g., [[Equalization (audio)|equalizers]] that adjust the bass and treble, [[Dynamic range compression|compressors]] that reduce signal peaks, etc.), [[amplifier]]s, which produce a powerful version of the resulting signal that can drive a [[loudspeaker]] and output transducers (e.g., loudspeakers in [[Loudspeaker enclosure|speaker cabinet]]s), which convert the signal back into sound energy (the sound heard by the audience and the performers). These primary parts involve varying numbers of individual components&lt;ref name="sound-equipment-1"&gt;[http://www.soundsinc.co.uk/sound-equipment.php Sound Equipment - Loudspeakers, Amplifiers, Signal Processors, Mixers, Music Source &amp; Microphones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108002100/http://www.soundsinc.co.uk/sound-equipment.php |date=2012-01-08 }}. Retrieved on 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve the desired goal of reinforcing and clarifying the sound to the audience, performers, or other individuals.

===Signal path===
Sound reinforcement in a large format system typically involves a signal path that starts with the signal inputs, which may be instrument [[Pick up (music technology)|pickups]] (on an [[electric guitar]] or [[electric bass]]) or a microphone that a vocalist is singing into or a microphone placed in front of an instrument or [[guitar amplifier]]. These signal inputs are plugged into the input jacks of a thick [[Audio multicore cable|multicore cable]] (often called a ''snake'').  The snake then delivers the signals of all of the inputs to one or more [[mixing console]]s.

In a coffeehouse or small nightclub, the snake may be only routed to a single mixing console, which an audio engineer will use to adjust the sound and volume of the onstage vocals and instruments that the audience hears through the main speakers and adjust the volume of the [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speakers]] that are aimed at the performers.

Mid- to large-size performing venues typically route the onstage signals to two [[mixing console]]s: the [[front of house]] (FOH), and the [[stage monitor system]], which is often a second mixer at the side of the stage. In these cases, at least two [[audio engineer]]s are required; one to do the main mix for the audience at FOH and another to do the monitor mix for the performers on stage.

Once the signal arrives at an input on a mixing console, this signal can be adjusted in many ways by the sound engineer. A signal can be [[Equalization (audio)|equalized]] (e.g., by adjusting the bass or treble of the sound), [[Dynamic range compression|compressed]] (to avoid unwanted signal peaks), or [[Panning (audio)|panned]] (that is sent to the left or right speakers).  The signal may also be routed into an external [[effects unit|effects processor]], such as a [[reverb]] effect, which outputs a ''wet'' (effected) version of the signal, which is typically mixed in varying amounts with the ''dry'' (effect-free) signal. Many electronic [[effects unit]]s are used in sound reinforcement systems, including [[digital delay]] and [[reverb]]. Some concerts use [[pitch correction]] effects (e.g., [[AutoTune]]), which electronically correct any out-of-tune singing.

Mixing consoles also have additional ''sends'', also referred to as ''auxes'' or ''aux sends'' (an abbreviation for "auxiliary send"), on each input channel so that a different mix can be created and sent elsewhere for another purpose. One usage for aux sends is to create a mix of the vocal and instrument signals for the monitor mix (this is what the onstage singers and musicians hear from their [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speakers]] or [[in-ear monitor]]s). Another use of an aux send is to select varying amounts of certain channels (via the aux send knobs on each channel), and then route these signals to an effects processor. A common example of the second use of aux sends is to send all of the vocal signals from a [[rock band]] through a reverb effect. While reverb is usually added to vocals in the main mix, it is not usually added to electric bass and other [[rhythm section]] instruments.

The processed input signals are then mixed to the master faders on the console. The next step in the signal path generally depends on the size of the system in place.  In smaller systems, the main outputs are often sent to an additional equalizer, or directly to a [[power amplifier]], with one or more loudspeakers (typically two, one on each side of the stage in smaller venues, or a large number in big venues) that are connected to that amplifier.  In large-format systems, the signal is typically first routed through an equalizer then to a [[Audio crossover|crossover]].  A crossover splits the signal into multiple frequency bands with each band being sent to separate amplifiers and speaker enclosures for low, middle, and high-frequency signals.  Low-frequency signals are sent to amplifiers and then to [[subwoofer]]s, and middle and high-frequency sounds are typically sent to amplifiers which power full-range [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] cabinets. Using a crossover to separate the sound into low, middle and high frequencies can lead to a "cleaner", clearer sound (see [[bi-amplification]]) than routing all of the frequencies through a single full-range speaker system. Nevertheless, many small venues still use a single full-range speaker system, as it is easier to set up and less expensive.

==System components==

===Input transducers===
[[File:Various-microphones.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Audio engineers use a range of microphones for different live sound applications.]]
[[Image:Polar pattern cardioid.png|thumb|right|170px|[[Cardioid]] mics are widely used in live sound, because their "apple-shaped" pickup pattern rejects sounds from the sides and rear of the mic, making it more resistant to unwanted [[audio feedback|feedback]] "howls".]]

Many types of input [[transducer]]s can be found in a sound reinforcement system, with [[microphone]]s being the most commonly used input device.  Microphones can be classified according to their method of transduction, [[Microphone#Polar patterns|polar pattern]] or their functional application.  Most microphones used in sound reinforcement are either dynamic or [[Condenser microphone|condenser]] microphones. One type of directional microphone, called ''cardioid'' mics, are widely used in live sound, because they reduce pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid unwanted [[audio feedback|feedback]] from the [[stage monitor system]].

Microphones used for sound reinforcement are positioned and mounted in many ways, including base-weighted upright stands, podium mounts, tie-clips, instrument mounts, and [[Headset (audio)|headset mounts]]. Microphones on stands are also placed in front of [[instrument amplifier]]s to pick up the sound. Headset mounted and tie-clip mounted microphones are often used with wireless transmission to allow performers or speakers to move freely.  Early adopters of headset mounted microphones technology included country singer [[Garth Brooks]],{{sfn |Eargle|Foreman|2002| p=62}} [[Kate Bush]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Badhorn|first=Philippe|title=Interview in Rolling Stone (France)|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of input transducers include [[magnetic pickup]]s used in electric guitars and electric basses, [[contact microphone]]s used on stringed instruments, and pianos and [[phonograph]] pickups (cartridges) used in record players. Electronic instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s can have their output signal routed directly to the mixing console. A [[DI unit]] may be necessary to adapt some of these sources to the inputs of the console.

===Wireless===
Wireless systems are typically used for electric guitar, bass, [[Wireless microphone|handheld microphones]] and in-ear monitor systems.  This lets performers move about the stage during the show or even go out into the audience without the worry of tripping over or disconnecting cables.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

===Mixing consoles===
[[Mixing console]]s are the heart of a sound reinforcement system. This is where the sound engineer can adjust the volume and tone of each input, whether it is a vocalist's microphone or the signal from an [[electric bass]], and mix, equalize and add effects to these sound sources. Doing the mixing for a live show requires a mix of technical and artistic/creative skills. A sound engineer needs to have an expert knowledge of speaker and amplifier set-up and other technologies. As well, a sound engineer has to have a good "ear" for what the music should sound like in order to create a good mix and use [[effects unit]]s appropriately. Every genre and style of music has different approaches to live sound mixing. The mixing approach for a [[hard rock]] band is very different from the mixing approach for a [[bluegrass music]] show; a hard rock show will typically have powerful [[subwoofer]] cabinets to create a "heavy", loud onstage sound. A bluegrass show will typically have a more "acoustic" or "natural" sound, in which the PA system simply reinforces the volume of the more quiet instruments.

Multiple consoles can be used for different applications in a single sound reinforcement system.  The Front of House (FOH) mixing console must be located where the operator can see the action on stage and hear the output of the loudspeaker system.  Some venues with permanently installed systems such as religious facilities and theaters place the mixing console within an enclosed booth, but this approach is more common for broadcast and recording applications.  This is far less common in live sound reproduction, since the engineer performs best when he can hear what the audience hears.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Large music productions often use a separate stage monitor mixing console which is dedicated to creating mixes for the performers' on-stage or in-ear monitors.  These consoles are typically placed at the side of the stage so that the operator can communicate with the performers on stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prosoundweb.com/install/tfw/eng/mon.php ''The Monitor Engineer's Role in Performance'' by Philip Manor]&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where performers have to play at a venue that does not have a monitor engineer near the stage, the monitor mixing is done by the FOH engineer from the FOH console, which is located amongst the audience or at the back of the hall.  This arrangement can be problematic because the performers end up having to request changes to the monitor mixes with "...hand signals and clever cryptic phrases" which may be misunderstood.  The engineer also cannot hear the changes that he is applying to the monitors on stage, often resulting in a reduction of the quality of the onstage monitor mix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweetwater.com/expert-center/techtips/d--02/16/2004 Tech Tips: ''Advantages of a Dedicated Monitor Mixing Console'' 2004-02-16], [[Sweetwater Sound]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signal processors===
{{Main|Effects unit}}
In the 2010s, small PA systems for venues such as bars and clubs are now available with features that were formerly only available on professional-level equipment, such as digital [[reverb]] effects, [[graphic equalizer]]s, and, in some models, [[feedback prevention]] circuits which electronically sense and prevent feedback "howls" before they become a problem. Digital effects units may offer multiple pre-set and variable reverb, echo and related effects. Digital loudspeaker management systems offer sound engineers digital delay (to ensure speakers are in sync with each other), limiting, crossover functions, EQ filters, compression and other functions in a single rack-mountable unit. In previous decades, sound engineers typically had to transport a substantial number of rack-mounted analog [[effects unit]] devices to accomplish these tasks.

====Equalizers====
[[Image:Graphic equalizer.jpg|thumb|200px|Graphic equalizer]]
[[Equalization (audio)|Equalizers]] are electronic devices that allow audio engineers to control the tone and frequencies of the sound in a channel, group (e.g., all the mics on a drumkit) or an entire stage's mix. The bass and treble controls on a [[home stereo]] are a simple type of equalizer. Equalizers exist in pro sound reinforcement systems in three forms: shelving equalizers (typically for a whole range of bass and treble frequencies), [[graphic equalizer]]s and [[parametric equalizer]]s. Graphic equalizers have [[fade (audio engineering)|faders]] (vertical slide controls) which together resemble a frequency response curve plotted on a graph. The faders can be used to boost or cut specific frequency bands. 

Using equalizers, frequencies which are too weak, such as a singer with modest projection in her/his lower register, can be boosted. Frequencies which are too loud, such as a "boomy" sounding [[bass drum]], or an overly resonant [[dreadnought guitar]] can be cut. Sound reinforcement systems typically use graphic equalizers with one-third [[octave]] frequency centers.  These are typically used to equalize output signals going to the main loudspeaker system or the monitor speakers on stage. [[Parametric equalization|Parametric equalizers]] are often built into each channel in mixing consoles, typically for the mid-range frequencies. They are also available as separate rackmount units which can be connected to a mixing board. Parametric equalizers typically use knobs and sometimes buttons. The audio engineer can select which frequency band to cut or boost, and then use additional knobs to cut or boost this frequency range. Parametric equalizers first became popular in the 1970s and have remained the program equalizer of choice for many engineers since then.

A [[high-pass filter|high-pass]] (low-cut) and/or [[low-pass filter|low-pass]] (high-cut) filter may also be included on equalizers or audio consoles. High-pass (low-cut) and low-pass (high-cut) filters restrict a given channel's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] extremes. Cutting very low frequency sound signals (termed [[infrasonic]], or ''subsonic'', a misnomer) reduces the waste of amplifier power which does not produce audible sound and which moreover can be hard on the low-range speakers. A low-pass filter to cut [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] energy is useful to prevent interference from radio frequencies, lighting control hum, or digital circuitry creeping into the power amplifiers. Such filters are often included with graphic and parametric equalizers to give the audio engineer full control of the frequency range.  If their response is steep enough, high-pass filters and low-pass filters function as end-cut filters{{clarify|date=May 2011}}.  A feedback suppressor is an automatically-adjusted band-reject or [[notch filter]] which includes a [[embedded system|microprocessor]] to detect the onset of  [[Audio feedback|feedback]] "howls" and direct the filter to suppress the feedback by lowering the gain right at the offending frequency.

====Compressors====
[[File:Comp. rack (Supernatural).jpg|thumb|150px|A rack of electronic audio compressors]]
[[Audio level compression|Compressors]] are designed to help the audio engineer to manage the dynamic range (loudness) of an audio signal, or a group of audio signals. Prior to the invention of automatic compressors, audio engineers accomplished the same goal by "riding the faders", which mean listening carefully to the mix and lowering the faders of any singer or instrument which was getting too loud.  A compressor accomplishes this by reducing the gain of a signal that is above a defined level (the threshold) by a defined amount (the ratio).  Without this gain reduction, a signal that gets, say 10% louder as an input, will be 10% louder at the output.  With the gain reduced, a signal that gets 10% louder at the input will be perhaps 3% louder at the output. Most compressors available are designed to allow the operator to select a ratio within a range typically between 1:1 and 20:1, with some allowing settings of up to ∞:1.  A compressor with an infinite ratio is typically referred to as a ''limiter''.  The speed that the compressor adjusts the gain of the signal (called the attack) is typically adjustable as is the final output of the device.

Compressor applications vary widely from objective system design criterion to subjective applications determined by variances in program material and engineer preference.  Some system design criteria specify limiters for component protection and gain structure control.  Artistic signal manipulation is a subjective technique widely utilized by mix engineers to improve clarity or to creatively alter the signal in relation to the program material.  An example of artistic compression is the typical heavy compression used on the various components of a modern rock drum kit.  The drums are processed to be perceived as sounding more punchy and full.
[[File:FOH Racks.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Effect processing rack-mounted units at the FOH position at an outdoor concert.]]

====Noise gates====
A [[noise gate]] sets a threshold where if it is quieter it will not let the signal pass and if it is louder it opens the gate.  A noise gate's function is in a sense the opposite to that of a compressor.  Noise gates are useful for microphones which will pick up noise which is not relevant to the program, such as the hum of a miked electric guitar amplifier or the rustling of papers on a minister's lectern. Noise gates are also used to process the microphones placed near the drums of a drum kit in many hard rock and metal bands.  Without a noise gate, the microphone for a specific instrument such as the floor tom will also pick up signal from nearby drums or cymbals.  With a noise gate, the threshold of sensitivity for each microphone on the drum kit can be set so that only the direct strike and subsequent decay of the drum will be heard, not the nearby sounds.

====Effects====
[[Reverberation]] and [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] effects are widely used in sound reinforcement systems to enhance the sound of the mix and create a desired artistic effect. Reverb and delay add a sense of spaciousness to the sound, imitating the sound of a singing voice or instrument in a large, reverberant hall. Many mixing boards designed for live sound include on-board reverb effects.  Modulation effects such as [[flanger]], [[Phaser (effect)|phaser]], and [[chorus effect|chorus]] are also applied to some instruments.  An [[Exciter (effect)|exciter]] "livens up" the sound of audio signals by applying dynamic equalization, phase manipulation and harmonic synthesis of typically high frequency signals.

The appropriate type, variation, and level of effects is quite subjective and is often collectively determined by a production's audio engineer, artists, [[bandleader]], [[music producer]], or musical director.  Reverb, for example, can give the effect of signal being present in anything from a small room to a massive hall, or even in a space that does not exist in the physical world.  The use of reverb often goes unnoticed by the audience, as it often sounds more natural than if the signal was left "dry" (without effects).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harmony-central.com/Effects/Articles/Reverb/ Reverberation]. Harmony-Central. Retrieved on January 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of effects in the reproduction of 2010-era pop music is often in an attempt to mimic the sound of the studio version of the artist's music in a live concert setting. For example, an audio engineer may use an [[Auto Tune]] effect to produce unusual vocal sound effects that a singer used on his/her recordings.

====Feedback suppressor====
A [[feedback suppressor]] detects unwanted [[audio feedback]] and suppresses it, typically by automatically inserting a [[notch filter]] into the signal path of the system, which prevents feedback "howls" from occurring. Audio feedback can create unwanted loud, screaming noises which are disruptive to the performance, and which can damage performers' and audience members' ears and speakers. Audio feedback from microphones occurs when a microphone "hears" the sound it is picking up through the monitor speakers or the main speakers. While microphone audio feedback is almost universally regarded as a negative phenomenon, in [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music]], [[electric guitar]]ists purposely create guitar feedback to create unique, sustained sounds with their guitar and [[guitar amplifier]]. This type of feedback is sought out by guitarists, so the sound engineer does not try to prevent it.

===Power amplifiers===
[[Image:Poweramps.JPG|thumb|200px|Three audio power amplifiers]]

A [[Audio amplifier|power amplifier]] is an electronic device which uses electrical power and circuitry to boost a low-voltage level signal (e.g., the signal from a vocalist's mic) and provides enough electrical power to drive a loudspeaker and produce sound.  All speakers, including [[headphones]], require power amplification.  Most professional audio amplifiers also provide protection from [[clipping (audio)|clipped]] (overloaded) signals, as a power amplifier pushed into clipping can damage or destroy speakers. Amplifiers also typically provide protection against [[short circuit]]s across the output, and excessive temperature (e.g., overheating).  A limiter is often used to protect loudspeakers and amplifiers from power amp clipping. 

Audio engineers select amplifiers that provide enough [[Headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]]. "Headroom" refers to the amount by which the signal-handling capabilities of an audio system exceed a designated [[nominal level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-what-exactly-headroom-and-why-it-important |title=Q. What exactly is ‘headroom’ and why is it important? |date=February 2010 |publisher=[[Sound on Sound]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headroom can be thought of as a safety zone allowing transient audio peaks to exceed the nominal level without damaging the system or the audio signal, e.g., via [[clipping (audio)|clipping]]. Standards bodies differ in their recommendations for nominal level and headroom. When an audio engineer has selected an amplifier (or amplifiers) with enough headroom, this also helps to ensure that the signal will remain clean and undistorted.

Like most sound reinforcement equipment products, professional amplifiers are typically designed to be mounted within standard [[19-inch rack]]s. Rack-mounted amps are typically housed in [[road case]]s, sturdy plastic protective boxes which prevent damage to the equipment during transportation. Active loudspeakers have internally mounted amplifiers that have been selected by the manufacturer to be a good amplifier for use with the given loudspeaker. Some active loudspeakers also have equalization, crossover and mixing circuitry built in.

Since amplifiers can generate a significant amount of heat, thermal dissipation is an important factor for operators to consider when mounting amplifiers into equipment racks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=emthlAnw7l4C ''Concert Sound and Lighting Systems'', Ch. 5, 'Power amplifiers',  By John Vasey]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many power amplifiers feature internal fans to draw air across their heat sinks. The heat sinks can become clogged with dust, which can adversely affect the cooling capabilities of the amplifier.

In the 1970s and 1980s, most PAs employed heavy [[Class AB amplifier]]s. In the late 1990s, power amplifiers in PA applications became lighter, smaller, more powerful, and more efficient, with the increasing use of switching power supplies and [[Class D amplifier]]s, which offered significant weight- and space-savings as well as increased efficiency. Often installed in railroad stations, stadia, and airports, Class D amplifiers can run with minimal additional cooling and with higher rack densities, compared to older amplifiers.

Digital loudspeaker management systems (DLMS) that combine digital crossover functions, compression, limiting, and other features in a single unit have become popular since their introduction.{{when|date=February 2016}} They are used to process the mix from the mixing console and route it to the various amplifiers.  Systems may include several loudspeakers, each with its own output optimized for a specific range of frequencies (i.e. bass, midrange, and treble).  Bi-amplifiication, tri-amplification, or quad-amplification of a sound reinforcement system with the aid of a DLMS results in a more efficient use of amplifier power by sending each amplifier only the frequencies appropriate for its respective loudspeaker.  Most DLMS units that are designed for use by non-professionals have calibration and testing functions such as a [[pink noise]] generator coupled with a [[real-time analyzer]] to allow automated room equalization.

===Output transducers===

====Main loudspeakers====
[[File:Line Array and Subs.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A large line array with separate subs and a smaller side fill line array.]]
A simple and inexpensive PA [[loudspeaker]] may have a single full-range [[loudspeaker driver]], housed in a suitable enclosure.  More elaborate, professional-caliber sound reinforcement loudspeakers may incorporate separate drivers to produce low, middle, and high [[frequency]] sounds.  A [[Audio crossover|crossover network]] routes the different frequencies to the appropriate drivers.  In the 1960s, [[Horn loudspeaker|horn loaded]] [[Theatre|theater]] loudspeakers and PA speakers were almost always "columns" of multiple drivers mounted in a vertical line within a tall enclosure.  The 1970s to early 1980s was a period of innovation in loudspeaker design with many sound reinforcement companies designing their own speakers.  The basic designs were based on commonly known designs and the speaker components were commercial speakers.

The areas of innovation were in cabinet design, durability, ease of packing and transport, and ease of setup.  This period also saw the introduction of the hanging or "flying" of main loudspeakers at large concerts.  During the 1980s the large speaker manufacturers started producing standard products using the innovations of the 1970s.  These were mostly smaller two way systems with 12", 15" or double 15" woofers and a [[Compression driver|high frequency driver]] attached to a high frequency horn.  The 1980s also saw the start of loudspeaker companies focused on the sound reinforcement market.  The 1990s saw the introduction of [[Line array]]s, where long vertical arrays of loudspeakers with a smaller cabinet are used to increase efficiency and provide even dispersion and frequency response.  This period also saw the introduction of inexpensive molded plastic speaker enclosures mounted on tripod stands.  Many feature built-in power amplifiers which made them practical for non-professionals to set up and operate successfully.  The sound quality available from these simple 'powered speakers' varies widely depending on the implementation.

Many sound reinforcement loudspeaker systems incorporate protection circuitry, preventing damage from excessive power or operator error.  Positive temperature coefficient resistors, specialized current-limiting light bulbs, and circuit-breakers were used alone or in combination to reduce driver failures.  During the same period, the professional sound reinforcement industry made the Neutrik [[Speakon]] NL4 and NL8 connectors the standard input connectors, replacing 1/4" jacks, [[XLR connector]]s, and [[Cannon (ITT Corporation)|Cannon]] multipin connectors which are all limited to a maximum of 15 amps of current.  XLR connectors are still the standard input connector on active loudspeaker cabinets.

The three different types of [[transducers]] are [[woofers|subwoofers]], compression drivers, and tweeters.  They  all feature the combination of a [[voicecoil]], [[magnet]], cone or [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]], and a frame or structure.  Loudspeakers have a power rating (in [[watt]]s) which indicates their maximum power capacity, to help users avoid overpowering them.  Thanks to the efforts of the [[Audio Engineering Society]] (AES) and the loudspeaker industry group ALMA, power-handling specifications became more trustworthy, although adoption of the EIA-426-B standard is far from universal.  Around the mid 1990s [[trapezoidal]]-shaped enclosures became popular as this shape allowed many of them to be easily arrayed together.
[[File:Mackie SWA1801 subwoofer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An 18" Mackie [[subwoofer]] cabinet.]]
A number of companies are now making lightweight, portable speaker systems for small venues that route the low-frequency parts of the music (electric bass, bass drum, etc.) to a powered [[subwoofer]]. Routing the low-frequency energy to a separate amplifier and subwoofer can substantially improve the bass-response of the system. Also, clarity may be enhanced, because low-frequency sounds take a great deal of power to amplify; with only a single amplifier for the entire sound spectrum, the power-hungry low-frequency sounds can take a disproportionate amount of the sound system's power.

Professional sound reinforcement speaker systems often include dedicated hardware for safely "flying" them above the stage area, to provide more even sound coverage and to maximize sight lines within performance venues.

====Monitor loudspeakers====
[[Image:12andbullet.jpg|thumb|A JBL floor monitor speaker cabinet with a 12" (30 cm) woofer and a "bullet" tweeter. Most monitor cabinets have a metal grille or woven plastic mesh to protect the loudspeaker.]]
[[Foldback (sound engineering)|Monitor loudspeakers]], also called "foldback" loudspeakers, are speaker cabinets which are used onstage to help performers to hear their singing or playing. As such, monitor speakers are pointed towards a performer or a section of the stage.  They are generally sent a different mix of vocals or instruments than the mix that is sent to the main loudspeaker system.  Monitor loudspeaker cabinets are often a wedge shape, directing their output upwards towards the performer when set on the floor of the stage.  Two-way, dual driver designs with a speaker cone and a horn are common, as monitor loudspeakers need to be smaller to save space on the stage.  These loudspeakers typically require less power and volume than the main loudspeaker system, as they only need to provide sound for a few people who are in relatively close proximity to the loudspeaker.  Some manufacturers have designed loudspeakers for use either as a component of a small PA system or as a monitor loudspeaker. In the 2000s, a number of manufacturers produced powered monitor speakers, which contain an integrated amplifier.

Using monitor speakers instead of in ear monitors typically results in an increase of stage volume, which can lead to more feedback issues and progressive hearing damage for the performers in front of them.&lt;ref name="in-ear tips"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audiologyonline.com/articles/article_detail.asp?article_id=2115|title=In-Ear Monitors: Tips of the Trade|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The clarity of the mix for the performer on stage is also typically not as clear as they hear more extraneous noise from around them.  The use of monitor loudspeakers, active (with an integrated amplifier) or passive, requires more cabling and gear on stage, resulting in an even more cluttered stage.  These factors, amongst others, have led to the increasing popularity of in-ear monitors.

====In-ear monitors====
[[Image:InEarMonitors.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|A pair of universal fit in-ear monitors. This particular model is the Etymotic ER-4S]]
[[In-ear monitor]]s are headphones that have been designed for use as monitors by a live performer.  They are either of a "universal fit" or "custom fit" design.  The universal fit in ear monitors feature rubber or foam tips that can be inserted into virtually anybody's ear.  Custom fit in ear monitors are created from an impression of the users ear that has been made by an [[audiologist]].  In-ear monitors are almost always used in conjunction with a wireless transmitting system, allowing the performer to freely move about the stage while maintaining their monitor mix.

In-ear monitors offer considerable isolation for the performer using them, meaning that the monitor engineer can craft a much more accurate and clear mix for the performer. With in-ear monitors, each performer can be sent their own customized mix; although this was also the case with monitor speakers, the in-ear monitors of one performer cannot be heard by the other musicians. A downside of this isolation is that the performer cannot hear the crowd or the comments other performers on stage that do not have microphones (e.g., if the bass player wishes to communicate to the drummer).  This has been remedied by larger productions by setting up a pair of microphones on each side of the stage facing the audience that are mixed into the in-ear monitor sends.&lt;ref name="in-ear tips" /&gt;

Since their introduction in the mid-1980s, in-ear monitors have grown to be the most popular monitoring choice for large touring acts. The reduction or elimination of loudspeakers other than instrument amplifiers on stage has allowed for cleaner and less problematic mixing situations for both the front of house and monitor engineers. [[Audio feedback]] is greatly reduced and there is less sound reflecting off the back wall of the stage out into the audience, which affects the clarity of the mix the front of house engineer is attempting to create.

==Applications==
Sound reinforcement systems are used in a broad range of different settings, each of which poses different challenges.

===Rental systems===
[[File:Sound System.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Staff set up sound system speaker cabinets for an outdoor event.]]
Audio visual (AV) rental systems have to be able to withstand heavy use, and even abuse from renters. For this reason, rental companies tend to own speaker cabinets which are heavily braced and protected with steel corners, and electronic equipment such as power amplifiers or effects are often mounted into protective road cases. As well, rental companies tend to select gear which has electronic protection features, such as speaker-protection circuitry and amplifier limiters.

As well, rental systems for non-professionals need to be easy to use and set up, and they must be easy to repair and maintain for the renting company. From this perspective, speaker cabinets need to have easy-to-access horns, speakers, and crossover circuitry, so that repairs or replacements can be made.  Some rental companies often rent powered amplifier-mixers, mixers with onboard effects, and powered subwoofers for use by non-professionals, which are easier to set up and use.

Many touring acts and large venue corporate events will rent large sound reinforcement systems that typically include one or more audio engineers on staff with the renting company.  In the case of rental systems for tours, there are typically several audio engineers and technicians from the rental company that tour with the band to set up and calibrate the equipment.  The individual that mixes the band is often selected and provided by the band, as they have become familiar with the various aspects of the show and have worked with the act to establish a general idea of how they want the show to sound.  The mixing engineer for an act sometimes also happens to be on staff with the rental company selected to provide the gear for the tour.

===Live music clubs and dance events===
[[File:FOH Pete Keppler with digidesign VENUE Profile live digital mixer and Genelec monitoring.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A front-of-house sound engineer with a Digidesign D-Show Profile live digital mixer and a computer monitor.]]

Setting up sound reinforcement for live music clubs and dance events often poses unique challenges, because there is such a large variety of venues which are used as clubs, ranging from former [[warehouses]] or music theaters to small restaurants or basement pubs with concrete walls. Dance events may be held in huge warehouses, aircraft hangars or outdoor spaces. In some cases, clubs are housed in multi-story venues with balconies or in "L"-shaped rooms, which makes it hard to get a consistent sound for all audience members. The solution is to use fill-in speakers to obtain good coverage, using a delay to ensure that the audience does not hear the same sound at different times. 

The number of [[subwoofer]] speaker cabinets and power amplifiers dedicated to low-frequency sounds used in a club depends on the type of club, the genres of music played there (live or via a DJ), and the size of the venue. A small [[coffeehouse]] where traditional folk, bluegrass or jazz groups are the main performers may have no subwoofers, and instead rely on the full-range main PA speakers to reproduce bass sounds. On the other hand, a club where [[hard rock]] or [[heavy metal music]] bands play or a [[nightclub]] where [[house music]] [[DJ]]s play [[dance music]] may have multiple large 18" subwoofers in big cabinets and powerful amplifiers dedicated for subwoofers, as these genres and music styles typically use powerful, deep bass sound.
[[File:Groovy 2007 IMG 8290 (1310587792).jpg|thumb|left|200px|A DJ gets his decks ready as the speaker cabinets are set up and readied for a dance event.]]
Another challenge with designing sound systems for live music clubs is that the sound system may need to be used for both prerecorded music played by [[DJ]]s and live music. If the sound system is optimized for prerecorded DJ music, then it will not provide the appropriate sound qualities (or mixing equipment and monitoring equipment) needed for live music, and vice versa. A club system designed for DJs needs a [[DJ mixer]] and space for [[phonograph|record players]]. Clubs tend to focus on either live music or DJ shows. However, clubs which feature both types of shows may face challenges providing the desired equipment and set-up for both uses. In contrast, a live music club needs a mixing board designed for live sound, an onstage monitor system, and a multicore "snake" cable running from the stage to the mixer. Lastly, live music clubs can be a hostile environment for sound gear, in that the air may be hot, humid, and smoky; in some clubs, keeping racks of power amplifiers cool may be a challenge. Often an air conditioned room just for the amplifiers is utilised.

===Church sound===
[[File:Iglesia Los Olivos.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The Iglesia Los Olivos church. P.A. speakers are mounted on the ceiling to reproduce the speech of the priest.]]
Designing systems in churches and similar religious facilities often poses a challenge, because the speakers may have to be unobtrusive to blend in with antique woodwork and stonework. In some cases, audio designers have designed custom-painted speaker cabinets so that the speakers will blend in with the church architecture. Some church facilities, such as [[sanctuaries]] or chapels are long rooms with low ceilings, which means that additional fill-in speakers are needed throughout the room to give good coverage. An additional challenge with church SR systems is that, once installed, they are often operated by amateur volunteers from the congregation, which means that they must be easy to operate and troubleshoot.

Some mixing consoles designed for houses of worship have automatic mixers, which turn down unused channels to reduce noise, and automatic feedback elimination circuits which detect and notch out frequencies that are feeding back. These features may also be available in multi-function consoles used in convention facilities and multi-purpose venues.

===Touring systems===
Touring sound systems have to be powerful and versatile enough to cover many different halls and venues, and they are available many different sizes and shapes. Touring systems range from mid-sized systems for bands playing [[nightclub]] and other mid-sized venues to large systems for groups playing [[stadium]]s, arenas and [[outdoor festival]]s. They also need to use "field-replaceable" components such as speakers, horns, and fuses, which are easily accessible for repairs during a tour. Tour sound systems are often designed with substantial redundancy features, so that in the event of equipment failure or amplifier overheating, the system will continue to function.  Touring systems for bands performing for crowds of a few thousand people and up are typically set up and operated by a team of technicians and engineers who travel with the performers to every show.
[[File:Meyer DSC 5476-01EC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Meyer line array of speaker cabinets is moved into position at an outdoor concert.]]
Mainstream bands that are going to perform in mid- to large-sized venues during their tour schedule one to two weeks of technical rehearsal with the entire concert system and production staff, including audio engineers, at hand.  This allows the audio and lighting engineers to become familiar with the show and establish presets on their digital equipment (e.g., digital mixers) for each part of the show, if needed. Many modern musical groups work with their Front of House and monitor mixing engineers during this time to establish what their general idea is of how the show and mix should sound, both for themselves on stage and for the audience.  

This often involves programming different effects and signal processing for use on specific songs, to make the songs sound somewhat similar to the studio versions. To manage a show with a lot of effects changes, the mixing engineers for the show often choose to use a [[digital mixing console]] so that they can save and automatically recall these many settings in between each song.  This time is also used by the system technicians to get familiar with the specific combination of gear that is going to be used on the tour and how it acoustically responds during the show.  These technicians remain busy during the show, making sure the SR system is operating properly and that the system is tuned correctly, as the acoustic response of a room or venue will respond differently throughout the day depending on the temperature, humidity, and number of people in the room or space.

"Weekend band" PA systems are a [[niche market]] for small, powerful touring SR gear. Weekend bands need systems that are small enough to fit into a minivan or a car trunk, and yet powerful enough to give adequate and even sound dispersion and vocal intelligibility in a noisy club or bar. As well, the systems need to be easy and quick to set up. Sound reinforcement companies have responded to this demand by offering equipment that fulfills multiple roles, such as powered mixers (a mixer with an integrated power amplifier and effects) and powered subwoofers (a subwoofer with an integrated power amplifier and crossover). These products minimize the number of wiring connections that bands have to make to set up the system and they take less time to set up. Some subwoofers have metal speaker mount holes built into the top, so that they can double as a base for the stand-mounted full-range PA speaker cabinets.

===Live theater===
Sound for live theater, operatic theater, and other dramatic applications may pose problems similar to those of churches, in cases where a theater is an old heritage building where speakers and wiring may have to blend in with woodwork.  The need for clear sight lines in some theaters may make the use of regular speaker cabinets unacceptable; instead, slim, low-profile speakers are often used instead.

In live theater and drama, performers move around onstage, which means that [[wireless]] microphones may have to be used. Wireless microphones need to be set up and maintained properly, to avoid interference and reception problems.

Some of the higher budget theater shows and musicals are mixed in surround sound live, often with the show's sound operator triggering sound effects that are being mixed with music and dialogue by the show's mixing engineer.  These systems are usually much more extensive to design, typically involving a separate sets of speakers for different zones in the theater.

===Classical music and opera===
[[File:20070919 Pritzker Pavilion speakers.JPG|left|thumb|the first permanent LARES outdoor speakers at a concert venue named [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]]]]

A subtle type of sound reinforcement called [[acoustic enhancement]] is used in some concert halls where classical music such as symphonies and opera is performed. Acoustic enhancement systems help give a more even sound in the hall and prevent "dead spots" in the audience seating area by "...augment[ing] a hall's intrinsic acoustic characteristics." The systems use "...an array of microphones connected to a computer [which is] connected to an array of loudspeakers." However, as concertgoers have become aware of the use of these systems, debates have arisen, because "...purists maintain that the natural acoustic sound of [Classical] voices [or] instruments in a given hall should not be altered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://harada-sound.com/sound/handbook/intro2.html Sound Systems- Why?!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kai Harada's article ''Opera's Dirty Little Secret''&lt;ref&gt;LiveDesignOnline.com. Kai Harada, Mar 1, 2001. [http://livedesignonline.com/mag/show_business_operas_dirty_little/ ''Opera's Dirty Little Secret''.] Retrieved on March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; states that opera houses have begun using electronic acoustic enhancement systems "...to compensate for flaws in a venue's acoustical architecture." Despite the uproar that has arisen amongst operagoers, Harada points out that none of the opera houses using acoustic enhancement systems "...use traditional, Broadway-style sound reinforcement, in which most if not all singers are equipped with radio microphones mixed to a series of unsightly loudspeakers scattered throughout the theatre." Instead, most opera houses use the sound reinforcement system for acoustic enhancement, and for subtle boosting of offstage voices, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in [[Tosca]] or thunder in Wagnerian operas).

Acoustic enhancement systems include [[LARES]] (Lexicon Acoustic Reinforcement and Enhancement System) and SIAP, the System for Improved Acoustic Performance. These systems use microphones, computer processing "with delay, phase, and frequency-response changes", and then send the signal "... to a large number of loudspeakers placed in extremities of the performance venue." Another acoustic enhancement system, VRAS (Variable Room Acoustics System) uses "...different algorithms based on microphones placed around the room." The Deutsche Staatsoper in Berlin and the Hummingbird Centre in Toronto use a LARES system. The Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, the Royal National Theatre in London, and the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]] in New York City use the SIAP system.&lt;ref&gt;Entertainment Design, Mar 1, 2001   {{cite web |url=http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&amp;magazinearticleid=66853&amp;siteid=15&amp;magazineid=138 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031082324/http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&amp;magazinearticleid=66853&amp;siteid=15&amp;magazineid=138 |archivedate=2013-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lecture halls and conference rooms===
Lecture halls and conference rooms pose the challenge of reproducing speech clearly to a large hall, which may have reflective, [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]-producing surfaces. One issue with reproducing speech is that the microphone used to pick up the sound of an individual's voice may also pick up unwanted sounds, such as the rustling of papers on a podium. A more tightly directional microphone may help to reduce unwanted background noises. 

Another challenge with doing live sound for individuals who are speaking at a conference is that, in comparison with [[Lead singer|professional singers]], individuals who are invited to speak at a forum may not be familiar with how microphones work. Some individuals may accidentally point the microphone towards a speaker or monitor speaker, which may cause [[audio feedback]] "howls". In some cases, when an individual who is speaking does not speak enough directly into the microphone, the audio engineer may ask the individual to wear a [[lavaliere microphone]], which can be clipped onto a lapel. 

In some conferences, sound engineers have to provide microphones for a large number of people who are speaking, in the case of a panel conference or debate. In some cases, automatic mixers are used to control the levels of the microphones, and turn off the channels for microphones which are not being spoken into, to reduce unwanted background noise and reduce the likelihood of feedback.

===Sports sound systems===
[[File:Haut parleur Nou Camp.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A speaker array mounted in the rafters in a camp sports facility.]]
Systems for outdoor sports facilities and ice rinks often have to deal with substantial echo, which can make speech unintelligible. Sports and recreational sound systems often face environmental challenges as well, such as the need for weather-proof outdoor speakers in outdoor stadiums and [[humidity]]- and splash-resistant speakers in swimming pools. Another challenge with sports sound reinforcement setups is that in many arenas and stadiums, the spectators are on all four sides of the playing field. This requires 360 degree sound coverage. This is very different from the norm with music festivals and music halls, where the musicians are on stage and the audience is seated in front of the stage.

==Setting up and testing==
Large-scale sound reinforcement systems are designed, installed, and operated by audio engineers and audio technicians. During the design phase of a newly constructed venue, [[audio engineers]] work with architects and contractors, to ensure that the proposed design will accommodate the speakers and provide an appropriate space for sound technicians and the racks of audio equipment.  Sound engineers will also provide advice on which audio components would best suit the space and its intended use, and on the correct placement and installation of these components. During the installation phase, sound engineers ensure that high-power electrical components are safely installed and connected and that ceiling or wall mounted speakers are properly mounted (or "flown") onto [[rigging]]. When the sound reinforcement components are installed, the sound engineers test and calibrate the system so that its sound production will be even across the frequency spectrum.

===System testing===
A sound reinforcement system should be able to accurately reproduce a signal from its input, through any processing, to its output without any coloration or distortion. However, due to inconsistencies in venue sizes, shapes, building materials, and even crowd densities, this is not always possible without prior calibration of the system. This can be done in one of several ways.
The oldest method of system [[calibration]] involves a set of healthy ears, test program material (i.e. music or speech), a graphic equalizer, and last but certainly not least, a familiarity with the proper (or desired) frequency response. One must then listen to the program material through the system, take note of any noticeable frequency changes or resonances, and subtly correct them using the equalizer.  Experienced engineers typically use a specific playlist of music that they have become very familiar with every time they calibrate a new system.  This "by ear" process is still done by many engineers, even when analysis equipment is used, as a final check of how the system sounds with music or speech playing through the system.

Another method of manual calibration requires a pair of high-quality headphones patched into the input signal ''before'' any processing (such as the pre-fade-listen of the test program input channel of the mixing console, or the headphone output of the CD player or tape deck). One can then use this direct signal as a near-perfect reference with which to find any differences in frequency response. This method may not be perfect, but it can be very helpful with limited resources or time, such as using pre-show music to correct for the changes in response caused by the arrival of a crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prosoundweb.com/live/articles/daverat/drifting.shtml|title= When Hearing Starts To Drift|accessdate=2007-04-26 |last= Rat|first= Dave|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher= |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011226141157/http://www.prosoundweb.com/live/articles/daverat/drifting.shtml|dead-url= yes|archivedate=2001-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because this is still a very subjective method of calibration, and because the human ear is so dynamic in its own response, the program material used for testing should be as similar as possible to that for which the system is being used.
[[File:Ashly Protea.jpg|thumb|right|A Rane RA 27 hardware [[Real Time Analyzer]] underneath an Ashly Protea II 4.24C speaker processor (with RS-232 connection)]]
Since the development of [[digital signal processing]] (DSP), there have been many pieces of equipment and computer software designed to shift the bulk of the work of system calibration from human auditory interpretation to software algorithms that run on microprocessors. One tool for calibrating a sound system using either DSP or Analog Signal Processing is a [[Real Time Analyzer]] (RTA).  This tool is usually used by piping [[pink noise]] into the system and measuring the result with a special calibrated microphone connected to the RTA.  Using this information, the system can be adjusted to help achieve the desired response.  The displayed response from the RTA mic cannot be taken as a perfect representation of the room as the analysis will be different, sometimes drastically, when the mic is placed in different position in front of the system.

More recently, sound engineers have seen the introduction of dual "fft" (fast-fourier transform) based audio analysis software which allows an engineer to view not only frequency vs. amplitude (pitch vs. volume) information that an RTA provides, but also to see the same signals (sounds) in the time domain. This provides the engineer with much more meaningful data than an rta alone. Also, dual fft analysis allows one to compare the source signal with the output signal and view the difference. This is a very fast way to calibrate a system to sound as close as possible to the original source material. As with any such measurement tool, it must always be verified using actual human ears. Some DSP system processing devices have been designed for use by non-professionals that automatically make adjustments in the system EQ based upon what is being read from the RTA mic.  These are practically never used by professionals, as they almost never calibrate the system as well as a professional audio engineer can manually.

==Equipment supply stores==
[[Professional audio store]]s sell microphones, [[speaker enclosure]]s, [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor]] speakers, [[audio console|mixing board]]s, rack-mounted [[effects unit]]s and related equipment designed for use by audio engineers and technicians. Professional audio stores are also called "pro audio stores", "pro sound stores", "sound reinforcement" companies, "PA system companies" or "audio-visual companies", with the latter name being used when a store supplies a significant amount of video equipment for events, such as video projectors and screens. Stores often use the word "professional" or "pro" in their name or the description of their store, to differentiate their stores from consumer [[electronics store]]s, which sell consumer-grade [[loudspeaker]]s, [[home cinema]] equipment, and amplifiers, which are designed for private, in-home use.

A '''trading room''' gathers [[trader (finance)|traders]] operating on [[financial market]]s. The trading room is also often called the [[front office]]. The terms "dealing room" and "[[trading floor]]" are also used, the latter being inspired from that of an [[open outcry]] [[stock exchange]]. As open outcry is gradually replaced by [[electronic trading]], the trading room gets the only living place that is emblematic of the financial market. It is also the likeliest place within the [[financial institution]] where the most recent [[Technology|technologies]] are implemented before being disseminated in its other [[business]]es.

Trading rooms are also known as "trading labs" or "finance labs" in universities and business schools. Trading rooms, have become a key medium in creating a "[[Wall Street|wall street]] atmosphere".

{{Financial markets}}

==Origin==
Before the sixties or seventies, the [[bank]]s' [[capital market]] businesses were mostly split into many departments, sometimes scattered at several sites, as market segments: [[money market]] (domestic and currencies), [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], long-term financing, exchange, [[bond market]]. By gathering these teams to a single site, banks want to ease:
* a more efficient broadcast of market information, for greater reactivity of traders;
* idea confrontation on market trends and opportunities;
* desk co-ordination towards customers.

==Context==
Trading rooms first appeared among [[United States]] [[bulge bracket]] brokers, such as [[Morgan Stanley]], from 1971, with the creation of [[NASDAQ]], which requires an [[equity (finance)|equity]] trading desk on their premises, and the growth of the [[secondary market]] of [[federal debt]] products, which requires a [[bond (finance)|bond]] trading desk.

The spread of trading rooms in [[Europe]], between 1982 and 1987, has been subsequently fostered by two reforms of the financial markets organization, that were carried out roughly simultaneously in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]].

In the United Kingdom, the [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]], removed the distinction between [[stockbroker]]s and [[stockjobber]]s, and prompted US [[investment bank]]s, hitherto deprived of access to the LSE, to set up a trading room in the [[City of London]].

In France, the deregulation of capital markets, carried out by [[Pierre Bérégovoy]], Economics and Finance Minister, between 1984 and 1986, led to the creation of money-market instruments, of an interest-rate [[Futures contract|futures]] market, [[MATIF]], of an equity options market, [[MONEP]], the streamlining of [[sovereign debt]] management, with multiple-[[auction]] bond issues and the creation of a [[primary dealer]] status. Every [[emerging market]] segment raised the need for new dedicated trader positions inside the trading room.

==Businesses==
A trading room serves two types of [[business]]:
* trading, and [[arbitrage]], a business of [[investment bank]]s and [[broker]]s, often referred to as the [[sell side]].
* [[Investment management|portfolio management]], a business of [[asset management]] companies and institutional investors, often referred to as the [[buy side]].
Brokers and investment banks set up their trading rooms first and large asset-management firms subsequently followed them.

The business type determines peculiarities in the organisation and the [[software]] environment inside the trading room.

==Organization==
Trading rooms are made up of "desks", specialised by product or market segment (equities, short-term, long-term, options...), that share a large [[Public space|open space]].

An investment bank's typical room makes a distinction between:
* ''traders'', whose role is to offer the best possible prices to ''[[sales]]'', by anticipating market trends. After striking a deal with a sales, the trader arranges a reverse trade either with another trader belonging to another entity of the same institution or to an outside counterparty;
* ''[[market maker|market-makers]]'', acting like wholesalers. Trades negotiated by market-makers usually bear standard terms.

Sales make deals tailored to their corporate customers' needs, that is, their terms are often specific. Focusing on their customer relationship, they may deal on the whole range of asset types.

[[Image:Carregosamail 68.JPG|thumb|Desk]]
Many large institutions have grouped their cash and derivative desks, while others, such as [[UBS]] or [[Deutsche Bank]], for example, giving the priority to customer relationship, structure their trading room as per customer segment, around sales desks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some large trading rooms hosts [[Offshore investment|offshore]] traders, acting on behalf of another entity of the same institution, located in another time-zone. One room in [[Paris]] may have traders paid for by the [[New York City]] [[subsidiary]], and whose working hours are consequently shifted. On the [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] desk, because this market is live on a 24/24 basis, a rolling book organisation can be implemented, whereby, a [[London]]-based trader, for instance, will inherit, at start of day, the open positions handed over by the [[Singapore]], [[Tokyo]], or [[Bahrein]] room, and manages them till his own end-of-day, when they are handed over to another colleague based in [[New York City]].

Some institutions, notably those that invested in a ''rapid development'' ([[Rapid Application Development|RAD]]) team, choose to blend profiles inside the trading room, where traders, [[financial engineer]]s and front-office dedicated software developers sit side by side. The latter therefore report to a head of trading rather than to a head of IT.

More recently, a profile of [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]] officer has also appeared; he or she makes sure the law, notably that relative to market use, and the code of conduct, are complied with.

The [[middle office]] and the [[back office]] are generally not located in the trading room.

The organisation is somewhat simpler with asset management firms:
* asset managers are responsible for portfolios or funds;
* "traders" are in contact with "brokers" – that is, with the above-mentioned investment banks' "sales"; however, this profile is absent from asset management firms that chose to [[outsourcing|outsource]] their trading desk.

The development of trading businesses, during the eighties and nineties, required ever larger trading rooms, specifically adapted to IT- and [[telephony]] cabling. Some institutions therefore moved their trading room from their downtown premises, from the [[City of London|City]] to [[Canary Wharf]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Infrastructure==

===The early years===
[[Telephone]] and [[teleprinter]] have been the broker's first main tools. The teleprinter, or Teletype, got [[financial quote]]s and printed them out on a [[ticker tape]]. US equities were identified by a [[ticker symbol]] made of one to three letters, followed by the last price, the lowest and the highest, as well as the volume of the day. Broadcasting neared real time, quotes being rarely delayed by more than 15 minutes, but the broker looking for a given [[security]]'s price had to read the tape...

[[File:Siemens T100 Telex.jpg|thumb|Teletype]]

As early as 1923, the Trans-Lux company installed the [[NYSE]] with a projection system of a transparent ticker tape onto a large screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system has been subsequently adopted by most NYSE-affiliated brokers till the 1960s.

In 1956 a solution called Teleregister,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to the market; this electro-mechanical board existed in two versions, of the top 50 or top 200 securities listed on the NYSE; but one had to be interested in those equities, and not in other ones...

During the 1960s, the trader's [[workstation]] was remarkable for the overcrowding of telephones. The trader juggled with handsets to discuss with several brokers simultaneously. The electromechanical, then electronic, [[calculator]] enabled him or her to perform basic computations.

In the 1970s, if the emergence of the [[PABX]] gave way to some simplification of the telephony equipment, the development of alternative display solutions, however, lead to a multiplication of the number of [[video monitor]]s on their desks, pieces of hardware that were specific and proprietary to their respective [[financial data vendor|financial data provider]].
The main actors of the financial data market were; [[Telerate]], [[Reuters]],&lt;ref&gt;with its Reuter Monitor, which has been decommissioned only in 1996{{cite web

===The advent of spreadsheets===
From the early 1980s trading rooms multiplied and took advantage of the spread of micro-computing. [[Spreadsheet]]s emerged, the products on offer being split between the [[MS-DOS]]/[[Windows]]/PC world and the [[Unix]] world. For PC, there was Lotus 1-2-3,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotus 1-2-3]]; used by a small percent of companies today&lt;/ref&gt; it was quickly superseded by [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], for workstations and [[Computer terminal|terminals]]. For UNIX, there was [[Applix]] and [[Informix Wingz|Wingz]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Informix Wingz|Wingz]]; used by a small percent of companies today&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Along video monitors, left space had to be found on desks to install a [[computer]] screen.

Quite rapidly, [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] got very popular among traders, as much as a [[decision support]] tool as a means to manage their position, and proved to be a strong factor for the choice of a [[Windows NT]] platform at the expense of a Unix or VAX/VMS platform.

Though software alternatives multiplied during this decade, the trading room was suffering from a lack of [[interoperability]] and integration. To begin with, there was scant automated transmission of trades from the front-office desktop tools, notably Excel, towards the enterprise application software that gradually got introduced in back-offices; traders recorded their deals by filling in a form printed in a different colour depending on the direction (buy/sell or loan/borrow), and a back-office clerk came and picked piles of tickets at regular intervals, so that these could be re-captured in another system.

===The digital revolution===
Video display applications were not only wrapped up in cumbersome boxes, their retrieval-based display mode was no longer adapted to markets that had been gaining much liquidity and henceforth required decisions in a couple of seconds. Traders expected market data to reach them in real time, with no intervention required from them with the keyboard or the mouse, and seamlessly feed their decision support and position handling tools.

The digital revolution, which started in the late 1980s, was the catalyst that helped meet these expectations. It found expression, inside the dealing room, in the installation of a digital data display system, a kind of local network. Incoming flows converged from different data providers,&lt;ref&gt;the feed of the main integrator, such as Reuters or Moneyline Telerate, typically complementing that of the local stock-exchange datafeed, like TOPCAC, in France, from Société de Bourse Française {{fr icon}} ([[Euronext Paris|SBF]])&lt;/ref&gt; and these syndicated data were distributed onto traders' desktops. One calls a ''feed-handler'' the [[server (computing)|server]] that acquires data from the integrator and transmits them to the local distribution system.

Reuters, with its TRIARCH 2000, Teknekron, with its TIB, Telerate with TTRS, Micrognosis with MIPS, soon shared this growing market. This infrastructure is a prerequisite to the further installation, on each desktop, of the software that acquires, displays and graphically analyses these data.

This type of software usually enables the trader to assemble the relevant information into composite pages, comprising a news panel, in text format, sliding in real time from bottom to top, a quotes panel, for instance spot rates against the [[US dollar]], every quote update or « tick » showing up in reverse video during one or two seconds, a graphical analysis panel, with [[moving average]]s, [[MACD]], candlesticks or other technical indicators, another panel that displays competitive quotes from different brokers, etc...

Two [[software package (installation)|software package]] families were belonging to this new generation of tools, one dedicated to Windows-NT platforms, the other to Unix and VMS platforms.

[[Image:MACD example, fast=12 slow=26 smooth=9.png|thumb|right|200px|[[technical analysis]] graphically shows a given asset's behaviour over a long or short period of time, in order to help anticipate the price's future path.]]

However Bloomberg and other, mostly domestic, providers, shunned this movement, preferring to stick to a [[Application Service Provider|service bureau]] model, where every desktop-based monitor just displays data that are stored and processed on the vendor's premises. The approach of these providers was to enrich their database and functionalities enough so that the issue of opening up their datafeed to any spreadsheet or third-party system gets pointless.

This decade also witnessed the irruption of television inside trading rooms. Press conferences held by [[central bank]] presidents are henceforth eagerly awaited events, where tone and gestures are decrypted. The trader has one eye on a TV set, the other on a computer screen, to watch how markets react to declarations, while having, very often, one customer over the phone. Reuters,&lt;ref&gt;Reuters Financial Television (RFTV) was launched in 1996 but closed in 2002 for lack of profitability&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg, [[CNN]], [[CNBC]] each propose their news channel specially dedicated to financial markets.

===Internet and bandwidth===
The development of the [[internet]] triggered the fall of the cost of information, including financial information. It hit a serious blow to integrators who, like Reuters, had invested a lot the years before to deliver data en masse and in real time to the markets, but henceforth recorded a wave of terminations of their data subscriptions as well as flagging sales of their data distribution and display software licences.

Moreover, the cable operators' investors lead to a huge growth of information capacity transport worldwide. Institutions with several trading rooms in the world took advantage of this [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to link their foreign sites to their headquarters in a [[hub and spoke]] model. The emergence of technologies like [[Citrix]] supported this evolution, since they enable remote users to connect to a [[virtual desktop]] from where they then access headquarters applications with a level of comfort similar to that of a local user. While an investment bank previously had to roll out a software in every trading room, it can now limit such an investment to a single site. The implementation cost of an overseas site gets reduced, mostly, to the telecoms budget.

And since the IT architecture gets simplified and centralised, it can also be outsourced. Indeed, from the last few years, the main technology providers{{who|date=July 2012}} active on the trading rooms market have been developing [[Internet hosting service|hosting]] services.

==Software equipment==
From the late 1980s, worksheets have been rapidly proliferating on traders' desktops while the head of the trading room still had to rely on consolidated positions that lacked both real time and accuracy. The diversity of [[valuation (finance)|valuation]] algorithms, the fragility of worksheets incurring the risk of loss of critical data, the mediocre response times delivered by PCs when running heavy calculations, the lack of visibility of the traders' goings-on, have all raised the need for shared information technology, or [[enterprise application]]s as the industry later called it.

But institutions have other requirements that depend on their business, whether it is trading or investment.

===Risk-management===
Within the investment bank, the trading division is keen to implement synergies between desks, such as:
* hedging the currency risk born from [[foreign exchange swap]]s or forward positions;
* funding by the money market desk of positions left open at end of day;
* hedging bond positions by interest-rate futures or options contracts.
Such processes require mutualisation of data.

Hence a number of package software come to the market, between 1990 and 1993 : Infinity, Summit, [[Kondor + Suite|Kondor+]], Finance Kit,&lt;ref&gt;Renamed Wall Street Suite after its publisher, the Finnish Trema, has been taken over, in 2006, by the US firm Wall Street Systems&lt;/ref&gt; Front Arena, [[Murex (financial software)|Murex]] and [[Sophis]] Risque, are quickly marketed under the umbrella of risk-management, a term more flattering though somewhat less accurate than that of position-keeping.&lt;ref&gt;Indeed, the increasingly dominant view was that risks had to be consolidated bank-wide, therefore outside the dealing room, and take correlation effects across all asset types into account; JPMorgan's RiskManager and Algorithmics's RiskWatch are the main software publishers building packages matching this conception&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Infinity died, in 1996, with the dream of the toolkit that was expected to model any innovation a financial engineer could have designed, the other systems are still well and alive in trading rooms. Born during the same period, they share many technical features, such as a [[three-tier architecture]], whose back-end runs on a Unix platform, a [[relational database]] on either [[Sybase]] or [[Oracle Database|Oracle]], and a [[graphical user interface]] written in English, since their clients are anywhere in the world. Deal capture of transactions by traders, position-keeping, measure of [[market risk]]s (interest-rates and foreign exchange), calculation of Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L), per desk or trader, control of limits set per counterparty, are the main functionalities delivered by these systems.

These functions will be later entrenched by national regulations, that tend to insist on adequate IT: in France, they are defined in 1997 in an instruction from the “Commission Bancaire” relative to internal control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

|publisher=Banque de France's site|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic trading===
Telephone, used on [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) markets, is prone to misunderstandings. Should the two parties fail to clearly understand each other on the trade terms, it may be too late to amend the transaction once the received confirmation reveals an anomaly.

The first markets to discover [[electronic trading]] are the foreign-exchange markets. Reuters creates its Reuter Monitor Dealing Service in 1981. Contreparties meet each other by the means of the screen and agree on a transaction in [[videotex]] mode, where data are loosely structured. Its next generation product, an [[electronic trading platform]] called [[Dealing 2000-2|Dealing 2000]], ported on Windows, is launched in 1989. Like [[Electronic Broking Services|EBS]], which competes with it head-on from 1997, it mostly handles spot trades.

Several products pop up in the world of electronic trading including [[Bloomberg Terminal]], [[ICAP (company)|BrokerTec]], [[Thomson Financial|TradeWeb]] and [[Reuters 3000 Xtra]] for securities and foreign exchange. While the Italian-born [[Telematico]] (MTS) finds its place, in the European trading rooms for trading of sovereign-debt.

More recently other specialised products have come to the market, such as [[Markit Group|Swapswire]], to deal interest-rate swaps, or [[SecFinex]] and EquiLend, to place [[securities lending|securities loans or borrowings]] (the borrower pays the subscription fee to the service).

However, these systems also generally lack liquidity. Contrarily to an oft-repeated prediction, electronic trading did not kill traditional inter-dealer brokerage. Besides, traders prefer to mix both modes: screen for [[price discovery]], and voice to arrange large transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order management and routing===
For organised markets products, processes are different: customer [[order (exchange)|orders]] must be collected and centralised; some part of them can be diverted for internal matching, through so-called [[alternative trading system]]s (ATS); orders with a large size, or on equities with poor liquidity or listed on a foreign bourse, and orders from corporate customers, whose sales contact is located in the trading room, are preferably routed either towards brokers, or to [[Multilateral trading facility|multilateral trading facilities]] (MTF); the rest goes directly to the local stock exchange, where the institution is electronically connected to.

Orders are subsequently executed, partially of fully, then allocated to the respective customer accounts. The increasing number of listed products and trading venues have made it necessary to manage this [[order book]] with an adequate software.

Stock exchanges and futures markets propose their own front-end system to capture and transmit orders, or possibly a programming interface, to allow member institutions to connect their order management system they developed in-house. But software publishers soon sell packages that take in charge the different [[communication protocol]]s to these markets; The UK-based [[Fidessa]] has a strong presence among [[London Stock Exchange|LSE]] members; [[GL Trade|Sungard Global Trading]] and the Swedish [[Orc Software]] are its biggest competitors.

===Program trading===
In [[program trading]], orders are generated by a software program instead of being placed by a trader taking a decision. More recently, it is rather called algorithmic trading. It applies only to organised markets, where transactions do not depend on a negotiation with a given counterparty.

A typical usage of program trading is to generate buy or sell orders on a given stock as soon as its price reaches a given threshold, upwards or downwards. A wave of stop sell orders has been largely incriminated, during the 1987 financial crises, as the main cause of acceleration of the fall in prices. However, program trading has not stopped developing, since then, particularly with the boom of [[Exchange-traded fund|ETFs]], mutual funds mimicking a stock-exchange index, and with the growth of structured asset management; an ETF replicating the [[FTSE 100]] index, for instance, sends multiples of 100 buy orders, or of as many sell orders, every day, depending on whether the fund records a net incoming or outgoing subscription flow. Such a combination of orders is also called a basket. Moreover, whenever the weight of any constituent stock in the index changes, for example following an [[equity capital]] increase, by the issuer, new basket orders should be generated so that the new portfolio distribution still reflects that of the index. If a program can generate more rapidly than a single trader a huge quantity of orders, it also requires monitoring by a [[financial engineer]], who adapts its program both to the evolution of the market and, now, to requirements of the [[bank regulation|banking regulator]] checking that it entails no [[market manipulation]]. Some trading rooms may now have as many financial engineers as traders.

The spread of program trading variants, many of which apply similar techniques, leads their designers to seek a competitive advantage by investing in hardware that adds computing capacity or by adapting their software code to [[Thread (computer science)|multi-threading]], so as to ensure their orders reach the central order book before their competitors'. The success of an [[algorithm]] therefore measures up to a couple of milliseconds.
This type of program trading, also called ''[[high-frequency trading]]'', conflicts however with the fairness principle between investors, and some regulators consider forbidding it

|publisher=Financial Times
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portfolio management===
With order executions coming back, the mutual fund's manager as well the investment bank's trader must update their positions. However, the manager does not need to revalue his in real time: as opposed to the trader whose time horizon is the day, the portfolio manager has a medium to long term perspective. Still, the manager needs to check that whatever he sells is available on his custodial account; he also needs a benchmarking functionality, whereby he may track his portfolio performance with that of his [[benchmarking|benchmark]]; should it diverge by too much, he would need a mechanism to rebalance it by generating automatically a number of buys and sells so that the portfolio distribution gets back to the benchmark's.

==Relations with the back-office==
In most countries the banking regulation requires a principle of independence between front-office and back-office: a deal made by the trading room must be validated by the back-office to be subsequently confirmed to the counterparty, to be settled, and accounted for. Both services must report to divisions that are independent from each at the highest possible level in the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.cssf.lu/uploads/media/iml93_101.pdf
|title=Circulaire IML 93-101 : Règles relatives à l'organisation et au contrôle interne de l'activité de marché des établissements de crédit
|publisher=Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF - Luxembourg)|language=fr}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In France, article 7.1 of CRBF 97-02 regulation&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the regulation goes further, a "four eyes' principle" requiring that every negotiation carried by any trader should be seen by another trader before being submitted to the back-office.

In Continental Europe, institutions have been stressing, since the early 1990s, on [[Straight Through Processing]] (STP), that is, automation of trade transmission to the back-office. Their aim is to raise productivity of back-office staff, by replacing trade re-capture by a validation process. Publishers of risk-management or asset-management software meet this expectation either by adding back-office functionalities within their system, hitherto dedicated to the front-office, or by developing their connectivity, to ease integration of trades into a proper back-office-oriented package.

Anglo-Saxon institutions, with fewer constraints in hiring additional staff in back-offices, have a less pressing need to automate and develop such interfaces only a few years later.

On securities markets, institutional reforms, aiming at reducing the settlement lag from a typical 3 business days, to one day or even zero day, can be a strong driver to automate data processes.

As long as front-office and back-offices run separately, traders most reluctant to capture their deals by themselves in the front-office system, which they naturally find more cumbersome than a spreadsheet, are tempted to discard themselves towards an assistant or a middle-office clerk. An STP policy is then an indirect means to compel traders to capture on their own. Moreover, IT-based trade-capture, in the shortest time from actual negotiation, is growingly seen, over the years, as a "best practice" or even a rule.[[Image:Birmingham Northern Rock bank run 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|Depositors queuing to close their account with Northern Rock]]

Banking regulation tends to deprive traders from the power to revalue their positions with prices of their choosing. However, the back-office staff is not necessarily best prepared to criticize the prices proposed by traders for complex or hardly liquid instruments and that no independent source, such as Bloomberg, publicize.

==Anatomy of the biggest failures==
Whether as an actor or as a simple witness, the trading room is the place that experiences any failure serious enough to put the company's existence at stake.

In the case of [[Northern Rock]], [[Bear Stearns]] or [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers]], all three wiped out by the [[subprime crisis]], in 2008, if the trading room finally could not find counterparts on the money market to refinance itself, and therefore had to face a [[liquidity crisis]], each of those defaults is due to the company's [[business model]], not to a dysfunction of its trading room.

On the contrary, in the examples shown below, if the failure has always been precipitated by market adverse conditions, it also has an operational cause :

These operational causes, in the above columns, are due to organisational or IT flaws :
* A fictitious trade gets possible whenever the system allows to post a trade to either a fictitious counterparty, or to a real counterparty, but for which the system sends neither a confirmation to that counterparty nor an automated message to the back-office, for settlement and accounting;
* Hidden position, which are fraudulent, and excess over authorized positions, which is not, are also made possible by the absence of a mechanism of limits control with transmission of a warning to the Risk Department, or by the absence of reaction by the recipient of such a warning;
* Some insider trading cases can be explained by the proximity, inside the trading room, of desks with conflicting interests, such as the one that arranges equity issues with that invests on behalf of customers.
* Price manipulation is also possible if no control is made on the share of an instrument that is held in relation to the total outstanding on the market, whether this outstanding is the total number of stocks of a given corporate issuer, or is the open position of a listed derivative instrument;
* Risk can be miscalculated, because it depends on parameters whose quality cannot be assessed, or because excessive confidence is put in the mathematical model that is used;
* An erroneous valuation may stem from a fraudulent handling of reference prices, or because the lack of fresh quotations on an instrument, and the failure to consider an alternative, model-based, valuation, have led to the use of obsolete prices;
* The lack of trader's control can be assessed by the weakness of the reporting required from him, or by the lack of expertise or critique by the recipients of this reporting;
* A user entitlement may prove inadequate, either because it is granted by the hierarchy in contradiction with the industry's best practices, or because, though not granted, it is still enforced either because the system cannot manage it or because, by neglect, it has not been properly set up in that system;
* Finally, a capture error may arise in a system with weak plausibility controls, such as that on a trade size, or with no « four eyes principle » mechanism, whereby a manifest anomaly would have been detected and stopped by a second person.

==Destroyed rooms==
* On May 5, 1996, during a Saturday to Sunday night, a fire, suspected to be criminal, ravaged the trading room of [[LCL S.A.|Crédit Lyonnais]]; trading businesses have been transferred in a couple of days to a backup, or disaster recovery, site, in outer Paris.
* On September 11, 2001, the attack against the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] destroyed the [[Cantor Fitzgerald]]'s trading room and killed 658 persons, two-thirds of its workforce.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet business resumed about one week later.

==Gambling==
Trading rooms are also used in the sports [[gambling]] sector. The term is often used to refer to the liabilities and odds setting departments of bookmakers where liabilities are managed and odds are adjusted. Examples include internet bookmakers based in the Caribbean and also legal bookmaking operations in the United Kingdom such as [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill]], [[Ladbrokes]] and Coral which operate trading rooms to manage their risk. The growth of betting exchanges such as Betfair has also led to the emergence of "trading rooms" designed for professional gamblers. (reference: Racing Post newspaper 19/7/07) The first such establishment was opened in Edinburgh in 2003 but later folded. Professional gamblers typically pay a daily "seat" fee of around £30 per day for the use of IT facilities and sports satellite feeds used for betting purposes. Today there are eight such trading rooms across the UK, with two based in London – one in [[Highgate]] and one in Canary Wharf.

[[File:Triggertrap.jpg|thumb|right|Triggertrap]]

'''Triggertrap''' was a company that created several different hardware and software products centred on triggering [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR camera]]s.

Products included several [[Arduino]]-based camera triggers, along with [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] apps which interface with cameras using a device that plugs into the headphone socket of the smartphone or tablet.

Triggertrap ceased trading on the 31st of January 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/triggertrap-playbook/triggertrap-going-out-of-business-faq-988112eebfef|title=Triggertrap Going out of Business FAQ|date=2017-01-31|website=Triggertrap Playbook|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The story of Triggertrap started in July 2011, when [[Haje Jan Kamps]] started a [[Kickstarter]] campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/photocritic/trigger-trap-the-universal-camera-trigger/ | title = Kickstarter: Triggertrap | accessdate = 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to raise support for a new type of camera trigger. The project asked for $25,000, but within a month nearly 900 supporters had pledged more than $77,000 in exchange for more than 950 Triggertrap v1 products - which is nearly three times more than what they wanted for the project.

==Arduino-based products==
[[File:Triggertrap shield on arduino.jpg|thumb|Triggertrap shield on arduino]]
The Triggertrap v1 is a programmable trigger based on [[Arduino]] open-source [[architecture]], and the source-code for the product is downloadable from [[GitHub]]. It has a built-in ambient light sensor, laser sensor, and sound sensor. In addition, it has an auxiliary port, which enables Triggertrap v1 to trigger a camera based on anything that generates an electric signal.

The Triggertrap v1 is classed as a high-speed device, able to use the ambient light sensor to respond and fire the external flash such that it would correctly sync at [[shutter (photography)|shutter]] speeds down to 1/640th of a second- that’s a response time of less than 1.6 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://triggertrap.com/using-the-triggertrap-as-a-slave-flash/ | title = Using the Triggertrap as a Slave Flash | accessdate = 2013-01-07 | last = Kamps | first = Haje Jan | authorlink = Haje Jan Kamps | date = 24 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using the [[Laser]] sensor, users can use a laser pointer or laser module (both visible and infra-red lasers are supported),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Haje Jan | last = Kamps | title = Aligning an IR laser for Triggertrap | date = 15 Mar 2012 | url = https://getsatisfaction.com/triggertrap/topics/how_can_i_align_an_infra_red_laser_i_cant_see_the_damn_thing | work = Get Satisfaction | accessdate = 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing it at the laser sensor of the device. The user can then choose to trigger "on break" (when the laser beam is broken), "on make" (when the laser beam hits the sensor), or both.

The device has a built-in sensor (a [[microphone]] with simple amplification circuitry) that can trigger the camera whenever Triggertrap v1 senses [[sound]] over a user-adjustable threshold.

Triggertrap v1 also has an [[Electrical connector|auxiliary]] port, to which the user can connect anything as long as the user can find a way to create an electric signal. This can be used to connect the Triggertrap v1 to a number of other devices. Among other things, the product's users have used the Aux sensor to take photos as part of theme-park rides and Halloween haunted house-type projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Brett | last = Hayes | title = Spooky Reaction Shots | date = 9 Oct 2012 | work = Get Satisfaction | accessdate = 2013-01-07 | url = https://getsatisfaction.com/triggertrap/topics/spooky_reactions_shots_at_our_haunted_attraction_using_triggertrap_v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device can control hundreds of cameras via [[infra-red]] or wired trigger system (depending upon cameras capability). "Part of the excitement about the Triggertrap", says its inventor, [[Haje Jan Kamps]], "is that I have no idea what people are going to use it for. It's an incredibly versatile piece of photography kit, and because it is so easy to hack, I'm expecting creativity to go off the charts."

The open-source nature of the Triggertrap v1 has attracted users to create a series of hacks and amendments to the original design, including 3D printed casings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mikehellers.com/blog/2012/09/06/3d-printing-improved-case-for-the-triggertrap-v1/ | title = Improved case for the Triggertrap v1 | accessdate = 2013-01-07 | last = Hellers | first = Mike | date = 6 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; suction mounts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/evanmjones/8097766040/in/pool-triggertrap/ | title = Triggertrap suction Mount | accessdate = 2013-01-07 | last = Jones | first = Evan | date = 16 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; tripod mounts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/evanmjones/8097765742 | title = Triggertrap Tripod Mount | accessdate = 2013-01-07 | last = Jones | first = Evan | date = 16 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; multi-camera adaptations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/26425221@N00/7997581782 | title = Triggertrap Camera Splitter | accessdate = 2013-01-07 | last = Bates | first = Andrew | date = 17 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

In addition to the Triggertrap v1, the Triggertrap company markets a Triggertrap Shield for Arduino. This is a feature-compatible version of the Triggertrap v1. After a user-configurable change in the config files,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://github.com/TriggerTrap/Triggertrap/blob/master/README.md | title = GitHub: Triggertrap Readme.md | accessdate = 2013-01-07 | author = Triggertrap Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; it runs on the same source code. The Shield for Arduino is cheaper, and aimed more at the hacking crowd.

==Triggertrap Mobile==
In May 2012, Triggertrap introduced Triggertrap Mobile for iOS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Charlie | last = Sorrel | title = Triggertrap Triggers Your SLR With Your iPhone | date = 4 May 2012 | url = http://www.cultofmac.com/165026/triggertrap-triggers-your-slr-with-your-iphone/ | work = Cult of Mac | accessdate = 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a version for Android in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Edgar | last = Alvarez | title = Triggertrap brings its auto shutter release powers to Android with new application | date = 13 Sep 2012 | publisher = AOL Media | url = https://www.engadget.com/2012/09/13/triggertrap-now-available-on-android/ | work = Engadget | accessdate = 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Triggertrap Mobile utilises the sensors and processing power of a smartphone or tablet running IOS to trigger cameras based on sound, motion, vibration, or location, in addition to [[timelapse]], bulb ramping, and other features. The Android app has more limited functionality, to some users dismay.

The apps connect to a camera by connecting a Triggertrap Mobile Dongle to the headphone socket of the smartphone or tablet. The app uses a coded audio signal, which the Mobile Dongle then translates into a signal the camera can use to trigger. The company currently sells nine different connection cables, covering more than 300 different camera models.

==Triggertrap Ada==
In November 2013, the ''Triggertrap Ada'' was successfully crowd-funded via [[Kickstarter]], raising £290,386 though the original goal was £50,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/triggertrap/triggertrap-redsnap-modular-camera-trigger Triggertrap Ada: Modular Camera Trigger; Kickstarter; November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 2 March 2015, Triggertrap announced that they had failed to bring the product into production and that the remaining 20% of the funds from the Kickstarter campaign was going to be returned to the original backers.&lt;ref name="failed"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/triggertrap/triggertrap-redsnap-modular-camera-trigger/posts/1144189 | title = It’s the end of the road. We failed. | accessdate = 2015-03-02 | publisher = Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/@Haje/how-a-half-million-dollar-kickstarter-project-can-crash-and-burn-5482d7d33ee1 How our $500K Kickstarter campaign crashed and burned; Haje Jan Kamps; Medium.com; March 2, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/@Haje/hardware-is-hard-getting-a-kickstarter-project-shipped-59c9596bdd7f Hardware is Hard: Getting a Kickstarter project out the door; Haje Jan Kamps; Medium.com; January 22, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Triggertrap and CEO [[Haje Jan Kamps]] received criticism from backers of the failed Triggertrap Ada project. Some backers have questioned the accuracy of the updates during the course of the campaign. Less than three months before the project was cancelled, Triggertrap announced that the shipping date would be May 2015, exactly 12 months after the original shipping estimate.&lt;ref&gt;Shipping Date Announcement! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/triggertrap/triggertrap-redsnap-modular-camera-trigger/posts/1085421 Retrieved 15 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Others have questioned the allocation of funds by Triggertrap and their interpretation of the Terms of Service that Triggertrap entered into when the project was created. Some have threatened legal action.&lt;ref&gt;Triggertrap Ada Kickstarter https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/triggertrap/triggertrap-redsnap-modular-camera-trigger/comments April 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reception==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10409">[[File:Via fence line.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Figure 1.'''  A microstrip line shielded by via fences on a printed circuit board]]
A '''via fence''', also called a '''picket fence''', is a structure used in [[planar (transmission line technologies)|planar electronic circuit technologies]] to improve isolation between components which would otherwise be coupled by [[electromagnetic field]]s.  It consists of a row of [[via hole]]s which, if spaced close enough together, form a barrier to electromagnetic [[wave propagation]] of slab modes in the substrate. Additionally if radiation in the air above the board is also to be suppressed, then a strip pad with via fence allows a shielding can to be electrically attached to the top side, but electrically behave as if it continued through the PCB.

Modern electronics have components and sub-units at high densities to achieve small size.  Typically, many functions are integrated on to the same board or [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]].  If not properly shielded from each other, many problems can result including poor frequency response, noise performance, and distortion.

Via fences are used to shield [[microstrip]] and [[stripline]] [[transmission line]]s, guard edges of printed circuit boards, shield functional circuit units from each other, and to form the walls of [[waveguide]]s integrated into a planar format.  Via fences are cheap and easy to implement, but use up board space and are not as effective as solid metal walls.

==Purpose==
[[planar (transmission line technologies)|Planar technologies]] are used at [[microwave]] frequencies and make use of printed circuit tracks as transmission lines.  As well as interconnections, these lines can be used to form components of functional units such as [[distributed element filter|filters]] and [[Power dividers and directional couplers#Transmission line types|couplers]].  Planar lines readily couple to each other when in close proximity, an effect called [[parasitic coupling]].  The coupling is due to [[fringing field]]s spreading from the edges of the line and intersecting adjacent lines or components.  This is a desirable feature within the unit where it is made use of as part of the design.  It is not desirable, however, that the fields couple to adjacent units.  Modern electronic devices are usually required to be small.  That, and the drive to keep down costs, leads to a high degree of integration and circuit units in less than desirable proximity.  Via fences are one method that can be used to reduce parasitic coupling between such units.&lt;ref&gt;Bahl, pages 290-291&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the many problems that can be caused by parasitic coupling are reducing [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], degrading [[passband]] flatness, reducing amplifier output power, increasing [[signal reflection|reflections]], worsening [[noise figure]], causing amplifier instability, and providing undesirable feedback paths.&lt;ref name="Bahlpage"&gt;Bahl, page 291&lt;/ref&gt;

In stripline, via fences running parallel to the line on either side serve to tie together the groundplanes, so preventing the propagation of parallel-plate modes.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, page 3.21&lt;/ref&gt; A similar arrangement is used to suppress unwanted modes in metal-backed [[coplanar waveguide]].

==Structure==
[[File:Via fence diagram.png|thumb|'''Figure 2.'''  Diagram of a microstrip via fence]]
A via fence consists of a row of [[via hole]]s, that is, holes that pass through the substrate and are metallised on the inside to connect to [[contact pad|pads]] on the top and bottom of the substrate.  In a [[stripline]] format both the top and bottom of the dielectric sheet are covered with a metal [[ground plane]] so any via holes are automatically grounded at both ends.  In other planar formats such as [[microstrip]] there is a ground plane only at the bottom of the substrate.  In these formats it is the usual practice to connect the top pads of the via fence with a metal track (see figure 2).  This still does not completely fence off the field as can be done in stripline.  In stripline the field can only propagate between the ground planes, but in microstrip it is able to leak over the top of the via fence.  Nevertheless, connecting the top pads improves isolation by {{nowrap|6-10 dB}}.&lt;ref name="Bahlpage" /&gt;  In some technologies it is more convenient to form the fence from conducting posts rather than vias.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, page 3.20&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Via fence top casting.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Figure 3.''' Casting providing the metal walls for placing over microstrip via fences]]
Isolation can be further improved by placing a metal wall on top of the via fence.  These walls commonly form part of the device enclosure.  The large holes in the via fences seen in figures 1 and 5 are screw holes for clamping these walls in place.  The wall casting belonging to this circuit is shown in figure 3.&lt;ref&gt;Ponchak ''et al.'', page 349&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Via hole equivalent circuit.svg|thumb|'''Figure 4.''' Via hole equivalent circuit]]
The design of the fence needs to consider the size and spacing of the vias.  Ideally, vias should act as short circuits, but they are not ideal and a via equivalent circuit can be modelled as a shunt inductance.  Sometimes, a more complex model is required such as the equivalent circuit shown in figure 4.  ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is due to the [[inductance]] of the pads and ''C'' is the [[capacitance]] between them.  ''R'' and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are, respectively, the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] and inductance of the via hole metallisation.  Resonances must be considered, in particular the parallel resonance of ''C'' and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will allow electromagnetic waves to pass at the resonant frequency.  This resonance needs to be placed outside the operating frequencies of the equipment concerned.  Spacing of the fences needs to be small in comparison to a wavelength (λ) in the substrate dielectric so as to make the fence appear solid to impinging waves.  If too large, waves will be able to pass through the gaps.  A common rule of thumb is to make the spacing less than λ/20 at the maximum operating frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{unbulleted list|style=margin-left:1em|Bahl, pages 290, 296 | Harper, pages 3.20-3.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Via stitching}}Applications==
[[File:Via fence edge.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 5.'''  Via fences shielding the edge of a printed circuit]]
Via fences are used primarily at [[Radio frequency|RF]] and [[microwave]] frequencies wherever planar formats are being applied.  They are used in [[printed circuit]] technologies such as microstrip, ceramic technologies such as [[low temperature co-fired ceramic]], [[monolithic microwave integrated circuit]]s, and [[system-on-a-package]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;Bahl, pages 290, 291&lt;/ref&gt;  They are especially important in isolating circuit units operating at different frequencies.

Also called '''via stitching''', via fences can be used around the edge of a printed circuit board, an example can be seen in figure 5.  This may be done to prevent [[electromagnetic interference]] with other equipment, or even to block radiation re-entering from elsewhere on the same circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Archambeault, pages 215-216&lt;/ref&gt;

Via fences are also used in [[post-wall waveguide]], also known as laminated waveguide (LWG).&lt;ref&gt;Pao &amp; Aguirre, page 585&lt;/ref&gt;  In LWG, two parallel via fences form the sidewalls of a waveguide.  Between them, and the upper and lower groundplanes of the substrate, is an electromagnetically isolated space.  There is no electrical conductor within this space, but electromagnetic waves can exist within the enclosed dielectric material of the substrate and their direction of propagation is guided by the LWG.  This technology is typically used at [[millimetre band]] frequencies and consequently dimensions are quite small.  Furthermore, good isolation requires that the vias are closely spaced.  Typically, {{nowrap|60 [[decibel|dB]]}} isolation is required between guides, that is {{nowrap|30 dB}} per fence.  A typical [[W band]] ({{nowrap|75-110 GHz}}) fence specification meeting this requirement in LWG is {{convert|.003|in|µm|adj=on}} vias spaced {{convert|.006|in|µm}} between centres.  This can be challenging to manufacture, and a higher density of vias is sometimes achieved by constructing the fence from two staggered rows of vias.&lt;ref&gt;Pao &amp; Aguirre, pages 586-589&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Via fences are cheap and convenient.  When used on planar formats they require no additional processes to manufacture.  On a printed circuit for instance, they are made in the same process that creates the track patterns.  However, via fences are not able to approach the isolation achievable with unbroken metal walls.&lt;ref&gt;Archambeault, page 216&lt;/ref&gt;

Via fences use up a lot of valuable substrate real estate and so will increase the overall size of the assembly.  Via fences too close to the line being guarded can degrade the isolation otherwise achievable.  In stripline, a rule of thumb is to place the fences at least four times the trace to groundplane distance away from the line being guarded.&lt;ref&gt;Joffe &amp; Lock, page 838&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Kundra was born in [[New Delhi]], [[India]], on October 9, 1974. He moved to [[Tanzania]] with his family at the age of one, when his father joined a group of professors and teachers to provide education to local residents. Kundra learned  [[Swahili language|Swahili]] as his first language, in addition to [[Hindi]] and English. His family moved to the [[Washington, D.C.]] metropolitan area when he was eleven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Career ==

Kundra served as director of Infrastructure Technology for [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]], Virginia, starting September 11, 2001.

Governor [[Tim Kaine]] appointed Kundra in January 2006 to the post of Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Technology for Virginia, the first dual cabinet role in the state's history.

Mayor Adrian Fenty appointed him on March 27, 2007 to the cabinet post of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for the [[District of Columbia]]. Kundra worked on developing programs to spur [[open source]] and [[crowdsourced]] applications using publicly accessible Web services from the District of Columbia. Building on the work of Suzanne Peck, who preceded him as DC's CTO and created the [http://data.octo.dc.gov/ D.C. Data Catalog],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/open-government-meets-it-161|title=Open government meets IT|author=Jon Udell|date=28 June 2006|work=InfoWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; he used that data as the source material for an initiative called [http://www.appsfordemocracy.org/ Apps for Democracy]. The contest yielded 47 web, iPhone and Facebook applications from residents in 30 days. Mayor Fenty stated that the program cost the District "50 thousand dollars total and we estimate that we will save the district millions of dollars in program development costs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/gt/articles/559929|title=47 Applications in 30 Days for $50K|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cost-benefit was claimed by the D.C. government as savings in internal operational and contractual costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appsfordemocracy.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a page from Kundra&lt;ref&gt;National Journal (06-29-2009)[http://techdailydose.nationaljournal.com/2009/06/bloomberg-unveils-govt-apps-co.php "Bloomberg Unveils Gov't Apps Contest"]&lt;/ref&gt; this initiative was mirrored by [[New York City]]'s mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] in launching a "BigApps" contest housed at [[New York City BigApps|NYC BigApps]] as well as New York City's DataMine.&lt;ref name=NYData&gt;New York Future Initiative (06-29-2009)[http://nyfi.observer.com/politics/208/pdf-bloomberg-announces-big-apps-contest-says-dine-winner "Bloomberg Announces 'Big Apps' Contest"]&lt;/ref&gt; The city of San Francisco launched a data portal similar DC's in 2009.&lt;ref name="SFData"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/pcio/San-Franciscos-DataSForg-Wont-be-a.html|title=San Francisco|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kundra won recognition for the project management system he implemented for the District government.&lt;ref name="galengruman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/adventures-in-it/2008-infoworld-cto-25-vivek-kundra-district-columbia-048|title=2008 InfoWorld CTO 25: Vivek Kundra, District of Columbia|author=Galen Gruman|date=2 June 2008|work=InfoWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mitcio.com"&gt;http://www.mitcio.com/2008/&lt;/ref&gt; The system imagined projects as publicly traded companies, project schedules as quarterly reports, and user satisfaction as stock prices. Buying or selling a stock corresponded to adding resources to a project or taking them away. The goal of management was to optimize the project portfolio for return on investment. The system effectively replaced subjective judgments about projects with objective, data driven analytics.&lt;ref name="galengruman"/&gt;

Kundra's efforts to use [[Cloud computing|cloud-based]] web applications in the D.C. government have also been considered innovative.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gcn.com/print/27_28/47565-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Following the D.C. example driven by Kundra, the city of Los Angeles is now taking steps to adopt the cloud computing model for its IT needs.&lt;ref name="LAcloud"&gt;news.cnet.com (08-20-2009)[http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10313846-245.html "Los Angeles gets its Google Apps groove"]&lt;/ref&gt; A D.C. spokeswoman said that the District of Columbia paid $479,560 for the Enterprise [[Google Apps]] license, which is $3.5 million less than what it had planned to spend on an alternative plan.&lt;ref name="LAcloud"/&gt; Since its deployment in July 2008 Google Apps is available to 38,000 D.C. city employees, but only 1,000&amp;ndash;2,000 are actively using Google Docs. Only 200 employees are actively using Gmail.&lt;ref name=PCWorld&gt;{{cite web|last=Perez|first=Juan Carlos|title=Despite Predictions to the Contrary, Exchange Holds off Gmail in D.C. |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/251920/despite_predictions_to_the_contrary_exchange_holds_off_gmail_in_dc.html|publisher=IDG News|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2010, hoping to spur use of [[Gmail]], the city ran a pilot program, selecting about 300 users and having them use the Google product for three months. Google participated closely in the project, but Gmail ultimately didn't pass the "as good or better" test with the users, who preferred Exchange/Outlook. In July 2011, the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) became the first federal agency to migrate its email services for 17,000 employees and contractors to the cloud-based Google Apps for Government, saving $15.2 million over 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/gsablog/2011/07/26/gsa-is-in-the-cloud/|title=GSA is in the Cloud|work=The GSA Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2011, government agencies in 42 states are leveraging cloud-based messaging and collaboration services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/07/google-apps-for-government-turns-one.html|title=Official Google for Work Blog: Google Apps for Government turns one!|work=Official Google for Work Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kundra also moved the city's [[geographic information systems]] department to a middle school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vivekkundra.blogspot.com/2007_11_01_archive.html|title=CTO's Blog: November 2007|author=Vivek Kundra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) ===

Before his appointment as CIO, Mr. Kundra served as technology adviser on President Barack Obama's transition team. Kundra was officially named by President Obama on March 5, 2009, to the post of Federal CIO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/06/16/our-nation-s-first-federal-cio|title=JUNE 16, 2011 AT 9:13 AM ET BY JACK LEW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Chief Information Officer is responsible for directing the policy and strategic planning of federal information technology investments as well as for oversight of federal technology spending. Until Kundra, the position had previously been more limited within the [[Office of Management and Budget]] where a federal chief information officer role had been created by the [[E-Government Act of 2002]].&lt;ref name=EGovtAct&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ347/html/PLAW-107publ347.htm|title="E-Government Act 2002"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal CIO establishes and oversees enterprise architecture to ensure system interoperability and information sharing and maintains information security and privacy across the federal government. According to President Obama, as Chief Information Officer, Kundra "will play a key role in making sure our government is running in the most secure, open, and efficient way possible".&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"/&gt; To further President Obama's overall technology agenda, Vivek Kundra, [[Jeffrey Zients]], the Chief Performance Officer, and [[Aneesh Chopra]], the Chief Technology Officer, will work closely together.&lt;ref name="reform-spending"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Weekly-Address-President-Obama-Discusses-Efforts-to-Reform-Spending/|title=Weekly Address: President Obama Discusses Efforts to Reform Spending, Government Waste; Names Chief Performance Officer and Chief Technology Officer|work=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2009-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507200048/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Weekly-Address-President-Obama-Discusses-Efforts-to-Reform-Spending/|archive-date=2009-05-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kundra and Chopra previously worked in Governor Tim Kaine's administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.virginia.gov/MediaRelations/newsReleases/viewRelease.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007171536/http://www.governor.virginia.gov/MediaRelations/NewsReleases/viewRelease.cfm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|archivedate=October 7, 2008 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kundra made it a priority to focus on the following areas: 
* Cybersecurity
* Ensuring openness and transparency
* Innovation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/gt/653151|title=Vivek Kundra, Federal CIO, Addresses State CIOs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lowering the cost of government
* Participatory democracy

One of his first projects was the launch of [[Data.gov]], a site for access to raw government data.&lt;ref name="radar.oreilly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/03/vivek-kundra-federal-cio-in-hi.html|title=Vivek Kundra: Federal CIO in His Own Words|author=Timothy M. O'Brien|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another project launched by Kundra in June 2009 was the Federal IT Dashboard, which gives an assessment (in terms of cost, schedule and CIO ranking) of many large government IT projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govtech.com/gt/698705?topic=290182&lt;/ref&gt;

====Democratizing Data====
Kundra launched the Data.gov platform on May 21, 2009&lt;ref name=BusWk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/blog/globespotting/archives/2009/12/the_power_of_go.html |title=The Power of Government-as-Platform|accessdate=2010-02-13 |last=Hamm |first=Steve |date=2009-12-01 |work=Business Week }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of providing public access to raw datasets generated by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government to enable public participation and private sector innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.gov | title=Data.gov |accessdate=2010-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data.gov draws conceptual parallels from the DC Data Catalog launched by Kundra when he was CTO of Washington, D.C., where he published vast amounts of datasets for public use. Immediately after the Data.gov launch, the Apps for America&lt;ref name=AforA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcn.com/articles/2009/04/24/sunlight.aspx |title=Sunlight Foundation reveals winners in its Apps for America contest|accessdate=2010-02-13 |last=Jackson |first=Joab |date=2009-04-24 |work=Government Computer News}}&lt;/ref&gt; contest by the [[Sunlight Foundation]] challenged the American people to develop innovative solutions using Data.gov. San Francisco,&lt;ref name="SFData"/&gt; the City of New York,&lt;ref name="NYData"/&gt; the State of California,&lt;ref name=CAData&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.gov/data |title=CA.Gov|accessdate=2010-02-14|work=State Of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; the State of Utah,&lt;ref name=UtahData&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utah.gov/data |title=Data-Utah.Gov|accessdate=2010-02-14|work=State Of Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt; the State of Michigan,&lt;ref name=SOMData&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/data/ |title=State of Michigan-Data|accessdate=2010-02-14|work=State Of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts&lt;ref name=MassData&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/data/ |title=Data-Mass.Gov|accessdate=2010-02-14|work=Commonwealth of Massauchussets}}&lt;/ref&gt; have launched public access websites modeled after Data.gov. Internationally, over 46 countries have launched open data sites patterned after Data.Gov, some using the U.S. Data.gov software which was made open source and made available on GitHub.  Additionally, states, cities and counties have launched sites, notably&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.data.gov/open-gov/|title=Open Government|work=Data.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Open Government in Canada|some cities in Canada]], and the UK are following suit.&lt;ref name=UKData&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.gov.uk |title=data.gov.uk|accessdate=2010-02-14|work=HM Government, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====IT Dashboard====
[[File:Obama testing the Federal Government IT Dashboard.jpg|thumb|President Barack Obama testing the IT Dashboard]]
On June 30, 2009, at the [[Personal Democracy Forum]] in New York,&lt;ref name=PdF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/pdf-09-kundra-unveils-it-spending-dashboard |title=PdF '09: Kundra Unveils IT Spending Dashboard|accessdate=2010-02-14 |last=Scola |first=Nancy |date=2009-06-30 |work=techPresident, Personal Democracy Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivek Kundra, unveiled the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090813013856/http://it.usaspending.gov/ IT Dashboard] that tracks over $76 billion in Federal IT spending.&lt;ref name=ITD&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://it.usaspending.gov/ |title=Federal IT Dashboard |access-date=2009-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813013856/http://it.usaspending.gov/ |archive-date=2009-08-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IT Dashboard is part of [http://www.USASpending.gov USASpending.gov] to track all government spending.&lt;ref name=USSpend&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaspending.gov/|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IT Dashboard is designed to provide CIOs of individual government agencies, the public and agency leaders unprecedented visibility into the operations and performance of Federal IT investments (spending), and the ability to provide and receive direct feedback to those directly accountable.&lt;ref name=ITDashNYT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/technology/01dashboard.html?_r=2 |title=Online Tool Will Track U.S. Tech Spending |accessdate=2010-02-14 |last=Lohr |first=Steve |date=2009-06-30 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, Kundra followed up the work on the IT Dashboard with TechStat accountability sessions.&lt;ref name=TechStat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2010/02/09/techstat-meetings-kundra.aspx |title=Federal CIO pursues relentless efficiency via TechStat meetings |accessdate=2010-02-14 |last=Weigelt |first=Matthew |date=2010-02-09 |work=Washington Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sessions are designed to turn around, halt or terminate at-risk and failing IT projects in the federal government. It allows agency CIOs, CFOs, and other key stakeholders to find solutions for IT projects that are over budget, behind schedule, or under-performing.

====Cloud Computing====
Kundra launched the federal government strategy and the cloud computing portal [[Apps.gov]] at [[NASA Ames Research Center|NASA's Ames Research Center]], [[Moffett Field, California|Moffett Field in California]], on September 15, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Ames Research Center, (2009-09-15) [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/features/2009/cloud_computing.html "NASA Ames Hosts White House CIO"], Retrieved (2010-01-17)&lt;/ref&gt; Apps.gov is a new service provided by the GSA&lt;ref name=appsgov&gt;GSA [https://www.apps.gov/cloud/advantage/main/start_page.do "Apps.Gov"], Retrieved (2010-01-17)&lt;/ref&gt; where federal agencies can subscribe to IT services. Kundra saw the cloud as an alternative to hardware investments, as means to reduce IT costs, and to shift focus of federal IT from infrastructure management to strategic projects.&lt;ref name="yearcio"/&gt;  This initiative aims to use commercially derived technologies to promote software tools, vast data storage and data sharing, and to foster collaboration across all federal agencies.&lt;ref name=appsgov/&gt; [[Howard Schmidt]], White House cybersecurity coordinator, will work closely with the Federal CIO and CTO with respect to cloud initiatives&lt;ref&gt;Federal News Radio (2010-02-11) [http://www.federalnewsradio.com/index.php?nid=249&amp;sid=1876391 "Cybersecurity coordinator Howard Schmidt discusses cloud"], retrieved (2010-02-15)&lt;/ref&gt; and has the responsibility of orchestrating all cybersecurity activities across the government.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Macon (2009-12-22) [http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/12/22/introducing-new-cybersecurity-coordinator "Introducing the New Cybersecurity Coordinator"], The White House, retrieved (2010-02-15)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2010, Kundra published the "25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology Management", which included Cloud First as one of its top priorities for achieving IT efficiency. Cloud First required each agency to identify three cloud initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/kundra-takes-on-federal-it-reform/2011/04/11/AFMwY5cE_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Marjorie | last=Censer | title=Kundra takes on federal IT reform | date=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced his decision to leave the federal government and join [[Harvard University]] within 7 months of this strategy, too short for any of cloud first initiatives to have demonstrated cost savings.&lt;ref name="gsaig.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsaig.gov/?LinkServID=1C91FE07-FF0A-7F2A-F5EC7659D924AE6D&amp;showMeta=0|title=GSA Office of Inspector General|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a short 5 months at Harvard he left to join [[Salesforce.com]], a cloud SaaS and PaaS provider.

The first major cloud project during his tenure was GSA's migration of e-mail/Lotus Notes to the Gmail and Salesforce.com's platform. GSA awarded a contract for e-mail in December 2010 and a five-year contract to Salesforce in August 2011.&lt;ref name="gsaig.gov"/&gt; A September 2012 Inspector General report found the savings and cost analysis not verifiable and recommended GSA update its cost analysis. GSA office of CIO  was unable to provide documentation supporting its analysis regarding the initial projected savings for government staffing and contractor support.  The audit found that the agency could neither verify those savings nor clearly determine if the cloud migration is meeting agency expectations despite initial claims that indicated 50% &lt;ref&gt;http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2010/12/02/unisys-google-apps-gsa.aspxs&lt;/ref&gt; cost savings &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/16/salesforce-hires-vivek-kundra-and-looks-overseas/ | work=The New York Times | first=Quentin | last=Hardy | title=Salesforce Hires Vivek Kundra and Looks Overseas | date=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Management Reforms====
Kundra published a 25-point implementation plan&lt;ref&gt;[http://cio.gov/documents/25-Point-Implementation-Plan-to-Reform-Federal%20IT.pdf 25-Point Implementation Plan to Reform], cio.gov&lt;/ref&gt; to reform how the federal government manages information technology. The execution plan follows his decision to reevaluate some of the government's most troubled IT projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704488404575442021240390314?KEYWORDS=vivek+kundra|work=The Wall Street Journal|first=Amy|last=Schatz|title=U.S. Reviews Tech Spending|date=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of 38 projects reviewed, four have been canceled,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/10/AR2010121006099.html|work=The Washington Post|first=Marjorie|last=Censer|title=Agencies have deadline to name services destined for Web|date=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 have been rescoped, and 12 have cut the time for delivery of functionality down by more than half, from two to three years down to an average of 8 months, achieving a total of $3 billion in lifecycle budget reductions, according to [http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/12/10/saving-money-government-it whitehouse.gov]
 
[[File:Saving Money on Government IT.jpg|basic|This image illustrates the work done by US Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra to reform Federal IT management]]

====Suspension====
On March 13, 2009, Kundra was placed on indefinite leave following an [[FBI]] raid on his former D.C. office and the arrest of two individuals in relation to a bribery investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Kangel, "Obama put new CIO Vivek kundra on suspension," ''Business Insider'' March 13, 2009 [http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-puts-new-cio-vivek-kundra-on-suspension-2009-3 link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kundra Reinstated as Federal CIO |url=http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2009/03/17/kundra-reinstated.aspx|date=March 18, 2009|publisher=[[Washington Technology]]|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kundra returned to duties after five days with no finding of wrongdoing on his part.

===Post-Obama administration career===
Kundra left his post as chief information officer in August 2011 to accept an academic fellowship at Harvard University, conducting research at both the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] and the [[Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Office of Management and Budget (2011-06-16) [http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/06/16/our-nation-s-first-federal-cio "Our Nation’s First Federal CIO"], The White House, retrieved (2011-06-18)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University (2011). [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/newsroom/vivek_kundra_fellowship U.S. C.I.O. to Serve Joint Fellowship at Harvard], retrieved August 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012 Kundra joined [[Salesforce.com]] as Executive Vice President of Emerging Markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/press-releases/2012/01/120116.jsp|title=Vivek Kundra Joins Salesforce.com as Executive Vice President of Emerging Markets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/17/sprinklr-hires-former-fed-cio-vivek-kundra-as-coo/|title=Vivek Kundra Joins Sprinklr as COO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kundra left [[Salesforce]] and joined the private start-up [[Sprinklr]] as [[Chief Operating Officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sprinklr.com/about-us/#leadership|title=Sprinklr Leadership Team|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional recognition ==
In May 2011, Kundra was selected by [[EMC Corporation]] for their Data Hero Visionary Award for his pioneering work under the Obama Administration to reform how the Federal government manages and uses information technology.&lt;ref name="emc"&gt;PR Newswire, [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-states-cio-vivek-kundra-receives-2011-data-hero-visionary-award-121528944.html "United States CIO Vivek Kundra Receives 2011 Data Hero Visionary Award"]&lt;/ref&gt; EMC states that, "Kundra has led the nation to seek innovative solutions to lower the cost of government operations, while exploring ways to fundamentally change the way the public sector and the public interact".&lt;ref name="emc"/&gt;

In March 2011, Kundra was selected by the World Economic Forum as a Young Global Leader for his professional accomplishments, commitment to society and potential to contribute to shaping the future of the world.&lt;ref name="ygl"&gt;Zopf, Yann (2011-03-11),[http://www.weforum.org/news/world-economic-forum-announces-young-global-leaders-2011-north-america "World Economic Forum Announces Young Global Leaders 2011 (North America)"], World Economic Forum&lt;/ref&gt;

Kundra was awarded the 2010 National Cyber Security Leadership Award&lt;ref name="sans"&gt;SANS Institute, (2010-11-16), [https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-leadership/2010/ "2010 National Cyber Security Leadership Award Winners"]&lt;/ref&gt; by the SANS Institute for uncovering more than $300 million each year in wasted federal spending on ineffective certification and accreditation reporting and demonstrating an alternative approach called "continuous monitoring" that provides more effective security for federal systems at lower costs.

Kundra was named Chief of the Year on December 21, 2009, by [[InformationWeek]] for driving unprecedented change in federal IT.&lt;ref name="yearcio"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chief Of The Year: Vivek Kundra |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/leadership/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222002611|date=December 21, 2009|publisher=[[Information Week]]|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[microwave]] engineering and circuit design, the '''Wilkinson Power Divider''' is a specific class of [[power divider]] circuit that can achieve isolation between the output ports while maintaining a matched condition on all ports.  The Wilkinson design can also be used as a power combiner because it is made up of [[passive components]] and hence reciprocal. First published by Ernest J. Wilkinson in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Wilkinson, "An N-way Power Divider", ''IRE Trans. on Microwave Theory and Techniques'', vol. 8, p. 116-118, Jan. 1960, doi: 10.1109/TMTT.1960.1124668&lt;/ref&gt; this circuit finds wide use in [[radio frequency]] communication systems utilizing multiple channels since the high degree of isolation between the output ports prevents [[crosstalk]] between the individual channels.

It uses [[Quarter-wave impedance transformer|quarter wave transformers]], which can be  easily fabricated as quarter wave lines on [[printed circuit board]]s. It is also possible to use other forms of transmission line (e.g. coaxial cable) or lumped circuit elements (inductors and capacitors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview and essentials of the Wilkinson divider splitter combiner |url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/coupler-combiner-splitter/wilkinson-splitter-combiner-divider.php|publisher=Radio-electronics.com|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[scattering parameters]] for the common case of a 2-way equal-split Wilkinson power divider at the design frequency is given by&lt;ref&gt;D.M. Pozar, ''Microwave Engineering'', Third Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
[S]=\frac{-j}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Inspection of the ''S'' matrix reveals that the network is reciprocal (&lt;math&gt;S_{ij}=S_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;), that the terminals are matched (&lt;math&gt;S_{11}, S_{22}, S_{33}=0&lt;/math&gt;), that the output terminals are isolated (&lt;math&gt;S_{23}, S_{32}&lt;/math&gt;=0),  and that equal power division is achieved (&lt;math&gt;S_{21}=S_{31}&lt;/math&gt;).  The non-[[unitary matrix]] results from the fact that the network is lossy. An ideal Wilkinson divider would yield &lt;math&gt;S_{21}=S_{31} = -3\,\text{dB} =10 \log_{10} (\frac{1}{2})&lt;/math&gt;. 

Network theorem governs that a divider cannot satisfy all three conditions (being matched, reciprocal and loss-less) at the same time. Wilkinson divider satisfies the first two (matched and reciprocal), and cannot satisfy the last one (being loss-less). Hence, there is some loss occurring in the network.

No loss occurs when the signals at ports 2 and 3 are in phase and have equal magnitude. In case of noise input to ports 2 and 3, the noise level at port 1 does not increase, half of the noise power is dissipated in the resistor.

By cascading, the input power might be divided to any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-number of outputs.


'''Unequal/Asymmetric Division Through Wilkinson Divider'''

If the arms for port 2 and 3 are connected with un-equal impedances, then asymmetric division of power can be achieved. 
When characteristic impedance is &lt;math&gt;Z_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, and one wants to split power as &lt;math&gt;P_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{3}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P_{2}&lt;/math&gt; ≠ &lt;math&gt;P_{3}&lt;/math&gt;, then the design can be created following the equations:

A new constant &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is defined for ease of expression, where &lt;math&gt;K^{2}= \frac{P_{3}}{P_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Unequal Wilkinson.png|thumb|400px|center|Impedances are different in two branches to achieve unequal splitting of power. The output impedances of the two branches are also different.]]
Then the design guideline is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Z_{02} =Z_{0} \sqrt{\frac{1+K^2}{K^3}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Z_{03} =Z_{0} \sqrt{K(1+K^2)}  = K^2 Z_{03}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;R =Z_{0} (K+\frac{1}{K}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It is to be noted that it can be set &lt;math&gt;K=1&lt;/math&gt; the above expression, and one would obtain the equal-splitting Wilkinson Divider.

'''Xeon Phi'''&lt;ref name=IntelXeonPhiName /&gt; is a series of [[x86]] [[Manycore processor|manycore processors]] designed and made entirely by [[Intel]]. They are intended for use in supercomputers, servers, and high-end workstations. Its architecture allows use of standard programming languages and APIs such as [[OpenMP]].&lt;ref&gt;https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/best-known-methods-for-using-openmp-on-intel-many-integrated-core-intel-mic-architecture&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was originally based on an earlier GPU design by Intel, it shares application areas with GPUs.{{cn|date=October 2017}} The main difference between Xeon Phi and a [[GPGPU]] like [[Nvidia Tesla]] is that Xeon Phi, with an x86-compatible core, can, with less modification, run software that was originally targeted at a standard x86 CPU.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Initially in the form of [[PCIe]]-based add-on cards, a second generation product, codenamed ''Knights Landing'' was announced in June 2013. These second generation chips could be used as a standalone CPU, rather than just as an add-in card.

[[File:Tianhe-2.jpg|thumb|The [[Tianhe-2]] supercomputer uses Xeon Phi processors.]]

Another contemporary Intel research project implementing x86 architecture on a many-multicore processor was the '[[Single-chip Cloud Computer]]' (prototype introduced 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/183653/intel_48core_singlechip_cloud_computer_improves_power_efficiency.html |title= Intel 48-Core "Single-Chip Cloud Computer" Improves Power Efficiency |author= Tony Bradley |publisher= [[PC World (magazine)|PCWorld]] |work= www.pcworld.com |date= December 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a design mimicking a [[cloud computing]] computer datacentre on a single chip with multiple independent cores: the prototype design included 48 cores per chip with hardware support for selective frequency and voltage control of cores to maximize energy efficiency, and incorporated a [[Mesh networking|mesh network]] for inter-chip messaging. The design lacked cache-coherent cores and focused on principles that would allow the design to scale to many more cores.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://techresearch.intel.com/ProjectDetails.aspx?Id=1 |title= Intel Research : Single-Chip Cloud Computer |publisher= [[Intel]] |work= techresearch.intel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, [[ScaleMP]] announced a virtualization update allowing Xeon Phi as a transparent processor extension, allowing legacy [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]]/[[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] code to run without code changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.scalemp.com/scalemp-vsmp-foundation-to-support-intel-xeon-phi |title= ScaleMP vSMP Foundation to Support Intel Xeon Phi |work= www.ScaleMP.com |publisher= [[ScaleMP]] |date= June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important component of the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor’s core is its vector processing unit (VPU).&lt;ref&gt;https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-xeon-phi-coprocessor-codename-knights-corner&lt;/ref&gt;
The VPU features a novel 512-bit SIMD instruction set, officially known as Intel Initial Many Core Instructions (Intel IMCI). Thus, the VPU can execute 16 [[Single-precision floating-point format|single-precision]] (SP) or 8 [[Double-precision floating-point format|double-precision]] (DP) operations per cycle. The VPU also supports Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) instructions and hence can execute 32 SP or 16 DP floating point operations per cycle. It also provides support for integers.
The VPU also features an Extended Math Unit (EMU) that can execute operations such as reciprocal, square root, and logarithm, thereby allowing these operations to be executed in a vector fashion with high bandwidth. The EMU operates by calculating polynomial approximations of these functions.

On November 12, 2012, Intel announced two Xeon Phi coprocessor families using the 22&amp;nbsp;nm process size: the Xeon Phi 3100 and the Xeon Phi 5110P.&lt;ref name="IntelXeonPhiProducts2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2012/11/12/intel-delivers-new-architecture-for-discovery-with-intel-xeon-phi-coprocessors|title=Intel Delivers New Architecture for Discovery with Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessors|date=November 12, 2012|publisher=Intel|author=IntelPR|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ComputerworldXeonPhiProducts2012&gt;{{cite news |title=Intel ships 60-core Xeon Phi processor |author=Agam Shah |publisher=Computerworld |url=https://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9233498/Intel_ships_60_core_Xeon_Phi_processor |date=November 12, 2012 |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AnandtechXeonPhiProducts2012&gt;{{cite news |title=The Xeon Phi at work at TACC |author=Johan De Gelas |publisher=AnandTech |url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/6451/the-xeon-phi-at-work-at-tacc |date=November 14, 2012 |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xeon Phi 3100 will be capable of more than 1&amp;nbsp;teraFLOPS of double precision floating point instructions with 240&amp;nbsp;GB/sec memory bandwidth at 300&amp;nbsp;W.&lt;ref name=IntelXeonPhiProducts2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ComputerworldXeonPhiProducts2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=AnandtechXeonPhiProducts2012/&gt; The Xeon Phi 5110P will be capable of 1.01&amp;nbsp;teraFLOPS of double precision floating point instructions with 320&amp;nbsp;GB/sec memory bandwidth at 225&amp;nbsp;W.&lt;ref name=IntelXeonPhiProducts2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ComputerworldXeonPhiProducts2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=AnandtechXeonPhiProducts2012/&gt; The Xeon Phi 7120P will be capable of 1.2&amp;nbsp;teraFLOPS of double precision floating point instructions with 352&amp;nbsp;GB/sec memory bandwidth at 300&amp;nbsp;W.

On June 17, 2013, the [[Tianhe-2]] supercomputer was announced&lt;ref name="top500june2013" /&gt; by [[TOP500]] as the world's fastest.  Tianhe-2 used Intel Ivy Bridge Xeon and Xeon Phi processors to achieve 33.86&amp;nbsp;petaFLOPS. It was the fastest on the list for two and a half years, lastly in November 2015.&lt;ref name="top500tianhe2"&gt;{{cite web

;Models
All models can boost to their peak speeds, adding 200&amp;nbsp;MHz to their base frequency when running just one or two cores. When running from three to the maximum number of cores, the chips can only boost 100&amp;nbsp;MHz above the base frequency. All chips run high-AVX code at a frequency reduced by 200&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel Xeon Phi processor: Your Path to Deeper Insight|url=https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/xeon-phi-processor-product-brief.pdf|website=Intel.com|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Yodlee partnered with [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]], providing its financial services platforms to all Y Combinator-funded companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/30/y-combinator-and-yodlee-team-up-to-give-startups-access-to-financial-data|title=Y Combinator and Yodlee Team-up To Give Startups Access To Financial Data|author=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and history==
Yodlee was started since 1999 by [[Venkat Rangan]] (vice chancellor of Amrita University); Sam Inala, Ramakrishna "Schwark" Satyavolu, Srihari Sampath Kumar (all earlier at Microsoft); and [[Sukhinder_Singh_Cassidy|Sukhinder Singh]] (earlier at Amazon.com and Junglee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Yodleeing Their Way to the Top| url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/oct/30us2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yodlee started operations (and is headquartered) in [[Redwood Shores, California]]. It also has offices in London, UK, and Bangalore, India. In 2000, Yodlee merged with its main competitor in the data aggregation space, an Atlanta-based company called VerticalOne, which was owned at the time by SecurityFirst, an internet banking firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S1 Corporation Completes Acquisition of VerticalOne Corporation|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/s1-corporation-completes-acquisition-of-verticalone-corporation-77138602.html|website=prnewswire.com|date=November 11, 1999|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of VerticalOne Corporation|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=36239|website=bloomberg.com|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010 Yodlee was said to have raised at least $116 million over its 10-year lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =  https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/18/mint-is-yodlees-youtube|title =Mint Is Yodlee's YouTube.|author=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press release in June 2008, it was announced that Bank of America led a $35 million financing and existing Yodlee investors, including its largest shareholder [[Warburg Pincus]] along with [[Accel Partners]] and [[Institutional Venture Partners]] participated in the financing round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finextra.com/fullstory.asp?id=18546|title=Yodlee raises $35m funding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2014, Yodlee went public on NASDAQ, trading under the symbol YDLE. It raised $75 million at $12/share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com//2014/10/02/yodlee-a-hub-for-financial-apps-raises-75-million-in-i-p-o/ |title =Yodlee, a Hub for Financial apps, Raises $75 Million in IPO|author=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2015 Yodlee sold itself to [[Envestnet]] for a reported $660 Million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/business/dealbook/yodlee-a-hub-for-financial-apps-sells-itself-to-envestnet.html|title=Yodlee, a Hub for Financial Apps, Sells Itself to Envestnet|author=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is no longer listed on the NASDAQ. In November 2017 Token partnered with Yodlee for payments and financial data aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bankingtech.com/1064352/token-and-envestnet-yodlee-team-up-for-open-banking/|title=Token and Envestnet {{!}} Yodlee team up for open banking  » Banking Technology|website=www.bankingtech.com|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
