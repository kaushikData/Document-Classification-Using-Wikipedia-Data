'''The American–Israeli Cooperative Enterprise''' ('''AICE''') is a non-profit [[501(c)(3)]] U.S.-based organization established in 1993 "to strengthen the [[Israel–United States relations|U.S.-Israel relationship]]."&lt;ref name="Crunchbase"&gt;{{cite web | title=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise | website=Crunchbase | url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/american-israeli-cooperative-enterprise | access-date=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization structure==

AICE's goals are enhancing the understanding and appreciation of Israel through social and educational programs in the United States, disseminating information about Israel; aiding efforts of students and faculty attempting to counteract [[anti-Zionist]] rhetoric and activities; promoting the study of Israel’s political system, culture, and society; and developing American universities’ appreciation of Israel as a subject worthy of serious attention. AICE's goals also include highlighting areas where Israel might contribute to the betterment of America, and publishing studies to identify specific programs and approaches that can benefit [[Americans]]. According to its mission statement, AICE aims to provide a vehicle for research, study and discussion between the peoples and governments of the United States and Israel; to facilitate of partnership between both nations; organize and publish joint activities that benefit the two; and provide resources, material, and more to promote scholarship in the field of Israel studies.&lt;ref name=about-aice&gt;{{cite web|title=About AICE|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/about-aice|work=JVL|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
AICE maintains a database that containing joint U.S.-Israel activities.  The database includes recipients of grants from the [[Binational Science Foundation]] (BSF), the Binational Agricultural Research and Development Foundation (BARD) and the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (BIRD).&lt;ref name=about-aice/&gt; Its Economic Partnership Databank contains information on more than 10,000 U.S. companies doing business in or with Israel. To address the critical need to develop new scholars and place established Israel scholars on campus, AICE has created the Israel Scholar Development Fund (ISDF). Some of their other major projects include bringing Israeli professors to teach Israel-related courses on U.S campuses, supporting visiting Israeli scholars teaching in the US.

===Visiting Israeli Professors (VIPs)===
AICE fellowship program, "Schusterman Visiting Israeli Professors",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel |url=http://www.schusterman.org/interests/israel/schusterman-visiting-israel-professors |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140510224508/http://www.schusterman.org/interests/israel/schusterman-visiting-israel-professors |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 May 2014 |work=Charles &amp; Lynn Schusterman Family Foundation |accessdate=10 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; brings Israeli academics to American campuses&lt;ref name="haaretz.com 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=The year BDS became the number one concern for American Jews | website=haaretz.com | date=December 27, 2014 | url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.633972 | access-date=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to ensure that expertise in the field will continue to be available from Israel while expanding within the United States. Visiting Israeli professors come from the Israeli universities [[Hebrew University]], [[University of Haifa]], [[Tel Aviv University]], [[Ben Gurion University]], and [[Bar Ilan University]]. In 2008, AICE financially assisted 29 Israelis (26 professors and three postdoctoral fellows) offering 70 courses in 27 universities throughout the United States and a further 11 graduate fellows and two postdoctoral research fellows. In the 2014-15 academic year, AICE reportedly selected 20 VIPs.&lt;ref&gt;https://israbib.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/fvipus1314/&lt;/ref&gt;

It is inscribed "ΑΔΕΛΦΩΝ".|Head of Ptolemy II Philadelphus with Arsinoe II behind. The Greek inscription ''ΑΔΕΛΦΩΝ'' means "[coin] of the siblings".]]

'''Arsinoë II''' ({{lang-grc-koi|Ἀρσινόη}}, 316 BC – unknown date between July 270 and 260 BC) was a [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic queen]] and co-regent of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] of [[ancient Egypt]].

Arsinoe was queen of [[Thrace]], [[Anatolia]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] by marriage to King [[Lysimachus]] ({{lang-grc-koi|Λυσίμαχος}}) and co-ruler of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] with her brother-husband, [[Pharaoh]] [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] ({{lang|grc|Πτολεμαῖος Φιλάδελφος}} "Ptolemy the Sibling-Loving"). Arsinoe was given the unprecedented Egyptian title "King of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]]", marking her as a full pharaoh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donnelly Carney|first=Elizabeth |authorlink=Elizabeth Donnelly Carney|title=Arsinoe of Egypt and Macedon: A Royal Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmzRCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-971101-7|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
 
===Early life===
Arsinoë was the first daughter of Pharaoh [[Ptolemy I Soter]] (Greek: Πτολεμαίος Σωτήρ, "Ptolemy the Savior"), founder of the Hellenistic state of Egypt, and his second wife [[Berenice I of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Did female Egyptian pharaoh rule before Cleopatra? |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40472692/ns/technology_and_science-science/ |quote= |work=[[MSNBC]] |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was born in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], but was raised in the new city of [[Alexandria]], where her father moved his capital early on.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Donnelly Carney"&gt;Elizabeth Donnelly Carney (2013). Arsinoe of Egypt and Macedon: A Royal Life. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-536551-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known of her childhood or education, but judging from her later life as patron of scholars and noted for her learning, she is estimated to have been given a high education.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Donnelly Carney"/&gt; Her brothers where tutored by intellectuals hired by their fathers, and it is regarded likely that she attended these lessons as well: she corresponded with the intellectual [[Strato of Lampsacus]] later in life, and he may have previously been her tutor.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Donnelly Carney"/&gt;

===Queen of Lysimachus===
At about age 15, Arsinoë married King Lysimachus (who was then around 60 years old),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carney|first=Elizabeth Donnelly|authorlink=Elizabeth Donnelly Carney|title=Arsinoe of Egypt and Macedon: A Royal Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYGL8RM_jb0C&amp;pg=PA31|year=2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-536551-1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom she had three sons: [[Ptolemy Epigonos]],&lt;ref&gt;Billows, ''Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism'', p.110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Griechische Geschichte von den Anfängen bis in die römische Kaiserzeit'', p.569&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/nios_i.htm|title=Ptolemy "the Son"|website=www.tyndalehouse.com|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lysimachus (son of Lysimachus)|Lysimachus]],&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Griechische Geschichte von den Anfängen bis in die römische Kaiserzeit'', p.569&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philip (son of Lysimachus)|Philip]].&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Griechische Geschichte von den Anfängen bis in die römische Kaiserzeit'', p.569&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to position her sons for the throne, she had Lysimachus' first son, [[Agathocles (son of Lysimachus)|Agathocles]], poisoned on account of treason.

Arsinoe reportedly paid for a rotunda in the [[Samothrace temple complex]], where she was likely an initiate.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Donnelly Carney"/&gt;

===Queen of Ptolemy Keraunos===
After Lysimachus' death in battle in 281 BC, she fled to [[Cassandreia]] ({{lang|grc|Κασσάνδρεια}}) and married her paternal half-brother [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], one of the sons of Ptolemy I Soter from his previous wife, [[Eurydice of Egypt]]. The marriage was for political reasons as they both claimed the throne of Macedonia and Thrace (by the time of his death Lysimachus was ruler of both regions, and his power extended to southern Greece and [[Anatolia]]). Their relationship was never good. 

As Ptolemy Keraunos was becoming more powerful, she decided it was time to stop him and conspired against him with her sons. This action caused Ptolemy Keraunus to kill two of her sons, Lysimachus and Philip, while the eldest, Ptolemy, was able to escape and to flee north, to the kingdom of the Dardanians. 

She herself sought refuge in the Samothrace temple complex, which she had benefited during her tenure as queen.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Donnelly Carney"/&gt; She eventually left from Samothrace for Alexandria, Egypt, to seek protection from her brother, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]].  

It is not known which year she left for Egypt. She may have left so early as 280, directly after the murder of the younger sons, or as late as 276, when the claim of her eldest son to the Macedonian throne had clearly failed after the succession of [[Antigonus II Gonatas]].&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Donnelly Carney"/&gt;   

[[File:Cameo gonzaga.jpg|thumb|right|"[[Gonzaga Cameo]]", [[Hermitage Museum]]]]

===Queen of Egypt===

In Egypt, she is believed to have instigated the accusation and exile of her brother Ptolemy II's first wife, [[Arsinoe I]]. Whether this was actually true is unknown: it is not known which year she arrived in Egypt, and her sister-in-law may already have been exiled at that point, or her divorce may have taken place without her involvement.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Donnelly Carney"/&gt;

Whatever the case, after the divorce of Ptolemy, Arsinoe II then married her brother. As a result, both were given the epithet "Philadelphoi" ({{lang-grc-koi|Φιλάδελφοι}} "Sibling-loving (plural)") by the presumably-scandalized Greeks. The closer circumstances and reasons behind the marriage is not known.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Donnelly Carney"/&gt;  

Her role as queen was unprecedented in the dynasty at the time and became a role model for later Ptolemaic queens: she acted alongside her brother in ritual and public display, became a religious and literal patron and was included in the Egyptian and Greek cults created by him for them.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Donnelly Carney"/&gt; Sharing in all of her brother's titles, she apparently was quite influential, having towns dedicated to her, her own cult (as was Egyptian custom), appearing on coinage and contributing to foreign policy, including Ptolemy II's victory in the [[Syrian Wars#First Syrian War .28274-271 BC.29|First Syrian War]] between Egypt and the [[Seleucid Empire]]. 

According to [[Posidippus]], she won three [[chariot race]]s at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], probably in 272 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Posidippus, P. Mil. Vogl. VIII 309, AB 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly Carney, Arsinoe of Egypt and Macedon: A Royal Life, pag. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After her death, Ptolemy II continued to refer to her on official documents, as well as supporting her coinage and cult. In establishing her worship as a goddess he justified his own cult.

The Athena School follows the guidelines set out by the [[NSW Board of Studies]] in its curriculum.&lt;ref name=Athena/&gt;

In March 2010 the [[Greens New South Wales]] party lodged an official complaint about the school to the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] due to an advertising leaflet which fails to reveal the school's link to Scientology. The Principal of the school said the Applied Scholastics study method did not teach the Scientology religion, "We follow the Board of Studies curriculum. We use the study method of L. Ron Hubbard. It is a method of study, it is not teaching Scientology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/09/2840274.htm |title=Greens refer Scientology school to consumer watchdog - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2013-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Green School program with Street Coolers ==

In 2015 the school started a "green school" program with Street Coolers, a community-focused organisation with a mission to cool our urban areas. This involved the school utilising several machines capable of creating several kilograms of compost per day, a reverse-vending machine open to the public, which allows individuals to recycle plastic bottles and aluminium cans for coupons, as well as energy and weather monitoring to assess power usage and how the weather affects this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Paving The Way For Sustainable Schools {{!}} The Athena School|url = http://www.athena.nsw.edu.au/3332/the-athena-school-is-paving-the-way-for-sustainable-schools/|website = The Athena School|accessdate = 2015-12-16|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222122938/http://www.athena.nsw.edu.au/3332/the-athena-school-is-paving-the-way-for-sustainable-schools/|archive-date = 22 December 2015|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Persecution ===

Concerning the Faith, the authors write: "The attractiveness of the movement stemmed from its belief in world brotherhood (a factor in its recent appeal in certain parts of Africa), the dedication of its organizers, and the vitality of its discussions, which contrasted sharply with the small concern in Morocco with the possibility of modernizing Islam." The reactions of various Moroccan leaders, newspaper publicity, and the final reversal of the convictions are noted.

=== Development of the community ===

The first summer school of Morocco for Bahá'ís was held in Meknes, from August 31 to September 6. Over twenty participants were gathered on a farm situated in a suburb of Meknes, belonging to one of the Persian pioneers, Hossein Rowhani Ardakani.

A separate entry discusses the [[Bahá'í/Bábí split]].

==`Abdu'l-Bahá's ministry==
{{anchor|abdulbaha-ministry}}
Bahá'u'lláh remained in the Akka-Haifa area under house arrest until his death in 1892. According to the terms of [[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Kitáb-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|his will]], his eldest son [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] was named the centre of authority; [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]], the eldest son from Bahá'u'lláh's second wife, was assigned a secondary position.&lt;ref&gt;Bahá'u'lláh, ''Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh'', [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-16.html#pg221 p. 221]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pursuant to his role as Centre of the Covenant, `Abdu'l-Bahá became the head of the Bahá'í community. Soon Muhammad `Ali complained that `Abdu'l-Bahá was not sharing authority and he started working against his elder brother.&lt;ref name="ency_ali"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most members of the families of Bahá'u'lláh's second and third wives supported Muhammad `Alí; however, there were very few outside of Haifa who followed him.&lt;ref name="ency_ali"/&gt;

Muhammad `Alí's machinations with the Ottoman authorities resulted in `Abdu'l-Bahá's re-arrest and confinement in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also caused the appointment of two official commissions of inquiry, which almost led to further exile and incarceration of `Abdu'l-Baha to North Africa. In the aftermath of the Young Turk revolution, Ottoman prisoners were freed thus ending the danger to `Abdu'l-Baha.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith2008|pg=43-44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Ibrahim George Kheiralla]], a Syrian Christian, converted to the Bahá'í Faith, emigrated to the United States and founded the first American Bahá'í community.&lt;ref name="Smith:Kheiralla"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |year=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, UK |page=218 |isbn=1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he was loyal to 'Abdu'l-Bahá. With time Kheiralla began teaching that `Abdu'l-Baha was the return of Christ, and this was becoming the widespread understanding among the Bahá'ís in the United States, despite `Abdu'l-Baha's efforts to correct the mistake.&lt;ref name="Smith:Kheiralla"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |title=The Baha'i Faith in the West |publisher=Kalimat Press |year=2004 |location= |pages=4, 7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7wyJdyE60oC&amp;lpg=PP13&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q |isbn=978-1-890688-11-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Kheiralla switched sides in the conflict between Bahá'u'lláh's sons and supported Mirza Muhammad Ali. He formed the Society of Behaists, a religious denomination promoting Unitarian Bahaism in the U.S., which was later led by [[Shua Ullah Behai]], son of Mirza Muhammad Ali, after he emigrated to the United States in June 1904 at the behest of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | editor-last = Cole | editor-first = Juan R.I. | editor2-last =  Quinn | editor2-first = Sholeh | editor3-last = Smith | editor3-first = Peter | editor4-last =  Walbridge | editor4-first =  John |title=Behai Quarterly |journal=Documents on the Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Movements |volume=08 |issue=2 |publisher=h-net.msu.edu |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/docs/vol8/bq.htm |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad `Alí's supporters either called themselves Behaists &lt;ref name="Behai Quarterly"&gt;Shu'a'ullah, [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/docs/vol8/bq.htm Behai Quarterly] [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/docs/vol8/42BQ03.gif Volume 4] [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/docs/vol8/42BQ23.gif Page 23]&lt;/ref&gt; or "Unitarian Bahá'ís".&lt;ref&gt;Browne, [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/material/msbrtoc.htm p. 82]. The reference appears to be to the [[Unitarianism|unitarian]] theology of one god, rather than any identification with the [[American Unitarian Association]].&lt;/ref&gt; From 1934 to 1937, Behai published Behai Quarterly a Unitarian Bahai magazine written in English and featuring the writings of Muhammad Ali and various other Unitarian Bahais.&lt;ref name="WarburgStudies"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Warburg |first=Margit |title=Bahá'í: Studies in Contemporary Religion |publisher=Signature Books |date= |page=64 |url=http://signaturebooks.com/?p=1164 |isbn=1-56085-169-4 |access-date=2010-04-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202111901/http://signaturebooks.com/?p=1164 |archive-date=2013-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

`Abdu'l-Bahá's response to determined opposition during his tenure was patterned on Bahá'u'lláh's&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.b"&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|2003|loc=§G.2.b}} [http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant#5.%20Dealing%20with%20Covenant-breaking.]&lt;/ref&gt;  example and evolved across three stages. Initially, like Bahá'u'lláh,&lt;ref name="Momen 2003 G.2.b"/&gt; he made no public statements but communicated with his brother Muhammad `Alí and his associates directly, or through intermediaries, in seeking reconciliation. When it became clear that reconciliation was not possible, and fearing damage to the community, 'Abdu'l-Bahá wrote to the Bahá'ís explaining the situation, identifying the individuals concerned and instructing the believers to sever all ties with those involved. Finally, he sent representatives to those areas most affected by the problem.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.c"&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|2003|loc=§G.2.c}} [http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant#5.%20Dealing%20with%20Covenant-breaking.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The function of these representatives was to explain matters to the Bahá'ís and to encourage them to persevere in cutting all contact. Often these chosen individuals would have `Abdu'l-Bahá's authority to open up communications with those involved to try to persuade them to return. In Iran, such envoys were principally the four [[Hands of the Cause#Appointed by Bahá'u'lláh|Hands of the Cause]] appointed by Bahá'u'lláh.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.c"/&gt;

===Aftermath===
{{anchor|Aftermath}}
When `Abdu'l-Bahá died, [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|his Will and Testament]] explained in some detail how Muhammad `Alí had been unfaithful to the Covenant, identifying him as a [[Covenant-breaker]] and appointing [[Shoghi Effendi]] as leader of the Faith with the title of [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]]. Bahá'í authors such as Hasan Balyuzi and Adib Taherzadeh set about refuting the claims of Muhammad `Alí. This represented what is often described as the most testing time for the [[Bahá'í Faith]].&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.c"/&gt;  The Behaists rejected the authority of the [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá]], claiming loyalty to the leadership succession as they inferred it from Baha'u'llah's [[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Kitáb-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|Kitab-i-Ahd]].&lt;ref name="Behai Quarterly"/&gt;

This schism had very little effect. In the `Akká area, the followers of Muhammad `Alí represented six families at most, they had no common religious activities,&lt;ref name="WarburgStudies"/&gt; and were almost wholly assimilated into Muslim society.&lt;ref name="maceoin3"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Bahai and Babi Schisms |encyclopedia=Iranica |publisher= |location= |id= |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bahaism-iii |first=Dennis |last=MacEoin |quote=In Palestine, the followers of Moḥammad-ʿAlī continued as a small group of families opposed to the Bahai leadership in Haifa; they have now been almost wholly re-assimilated into Muslim society.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern academic observer has reported an attempt to revive the claims of Muhammad Ali in order to lend legitimacy to a newly established sect avowing loyalty to Bahá'u'lláh but rejecting the authority that Bahá'u'lláh gave to 'Abdu’l-Bahá and to the Universal House of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=McGlinn |first=Sen |title=A Muhammad Ali revival? |work= |date=March 27, 2010 |url=http://senmcglinn.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/muhammad-ali/ |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Nigar Bahai Amsalem, the great-granddaughter of Bahá'u'lláh and granddaughter of both Mirza Muhammad Ali and Bahá'u'lláh's youngest son [[Mirza Badi'u'llah Effendí|Badi'u'llah]], was interviewed&lt;ref name="thetruth"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Masumian |first=Abid |last2=Momen |first2=Moojan |title=The Truth about Baha'u'llah's Great-Granddaughter, Nigar Bahai Amsalem |publisher=? |date=n.d. |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/17497747/Bahaullahs-Great-Grand-Daughter-Nigar-Bahai-Amsalem |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2006 Israeli [[mockumentary]] film &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Schory |first=Noemi |title=Producer's Statement |work=Bahais in My Backyard, A Belfilms Production |publisher=firsthandfilms.com |date=2010-04-17 |url=http://www.firsthandfilms.com/index.php?film=1000184 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;''Baha'is In My Backyard''. It mentions that she has built a shrine at the tomb of Mirza Muhammad Ali and opposes the Universal House of Justice. She withheld information on the extent of her opposition during her interview for the film.&lt;ref name="thetruth"/&gt;

==Shoghi Effendi as Guardian==
{{anchor|Shoghi}}

===Appointment===
[[File:Shoghi Effendi2.jpg|thumb|200px|Shoghi Effendi at the time of becoming Guardian in 1921. Taken in Haifa.]]
At 24, [[Shoghi Effendi]] was particularly young when he assumed leadership of the religion in 1921, as provided for by `Abdu'l-Bahá in his Will and Testament. He had received a Western education at the [[American University of Beirut|Syrian Protestant College]] and later at [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford]].

At this time Muhammad-`Alí revived his claim to leadership of the Bahá'í community.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.d.iv"/&gt; He seized the keys of the Tomb of Bahá'u'lláh at the [[mansion of Bahjí]], expelled its keeper, and demanded that he be recognized by the authorities as the legal custodian of that property. However, the Palestine authorities, after having conducted some investigations, instructed the British officer in `Akká to deliver the keys into the hands of the keeper loyal to Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=355}} [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-24.html#pg355]&lt;/ref&gt;

===American disputes===
After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, [[Ruth White (Bahá'í author)|Ruth White]] questioned the Will's authenticity as early as 1926,&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.d.i"&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|2003|loc=§G.2.d.i}} [http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant#5.%20Dealing%20with%20Covenant-breaking.]&lt;/ref&gt; and openly opposed Shoghi Effendi's Guardianship, publishing several books on the subject. She wrote a letter to the United States Postmaster General and asked him, among other things, to prohibit the National Spiritual Assembly from "using the United States Mails to spread the falsehood that Shoghi Effendi is the successor of `Abdu'l-Bahá and the Guardian of the Cause." She also wrote a letter to the High Commissioner for Palestine; both of these letters were ignored.

Another division occurred primarily within the American Bahá'í community, which increasingly consisted of non-Persians with an interest in alternative spiritual pursuits. Many had been strongly attracted to the personality of `Abdu'l-Bahá and the spiritual teachings of the Bahá'í Faith. Some regarded it as an ecumenical society to which all persons of goodwill—regardless of religion—might join. When Shoghi Effendi made clear his position that the Bahá'í Faith was an independent religion with its own distinct administration through local and national spiritual assemblies, a few felt that he had overstepped the bounds of his authority. Most prominent among them was a New York group including [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]], [[Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler|Lewis]] and [[Julia Lynch Olin|Julia Chanler]], who founded the "New History Society", and its youth section, the [[Caravan of East and West]].&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.d.ii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|2003|loc=§G.2.d.ii}} [http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant#5.%20Dealing%20with%20Covenant-breaking.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, ''The Bahá'í Cause'' [http://bahai-library.com/sohrab_ferm pp. 309-14]&lt;/ref&gt; Sohrab and the Chanlers refused to be overseen by the New York Spiritual Assembly, and were expelled by Shoghi Effendi as [[Covenant-breaker]]s.&lt;ref name="ency_sohrab"/&gt; They argued that the expulsion was meaningless because they believed the faith could not be institutionalized. The New History Society published several works by Sohrab and Chanler and others.   Sohrab accepted the legitimacy of Shoghi Effendi as Guardian, but was critical of the manner of his leadership and the methods of organizing the  Bahá'í administration.&lt;ref name="ency_sohrab"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New History Society attracted fewer than a dozen Bahá'ís, however its membership swelled to several thousand for a time. The New History Society was active until 1959 and is now defunct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Baha'is in the West |volume=14 | editor-first = Peter |editor-last= Smith |year=2004 |publisher=Kalimat Press |first=Peter |last=Smith |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Caravan House, aka Caravan Institute, later disassociated itself from the Bahá'í Faith, and remained as an unrelated non-profit educational organization.&lt;ref&gt;Moojan Momen 2003, § G.2.d.ii [http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant] See also New York Tax Exempt and NonProfit Organizations [http://www.taxexemptworld.com/organizations/new_york_ny_10021.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the divisions of this period were short-lived and restricted in their influence.&lt;ref name="maceoin2"/&gt;

===Family members expelled===
{{Main article|Covenant-breaker}}
In 1932 Shoghi Effendi's great aunt, [[Bahiyyih Khanum]], died. She was highly respected and had instructed all to follow Shoghi Effendi through several telegrams she had sent around the world announcing the basics of the provisions of `Abdu'l-Bahá's will and was witness to the actions relatives took in violation of provisions of the will.&lt;ref name="JKhanProphetDaughter123"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khan |first=Janet A. |year=2005 |title=Prophet's Daughter: The Life and Legacy of Bahíyyih Khánum, Outstanding Heroine Of The Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=1-931847-14-2 |pages=123–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8W-2DjcShcC&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;pg=PA123#v=onepage&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahíyyih Khánum had devoted much of her life towards protecting the accepted leadership of the Bahá'í Faith and after Shoghi Effendi's appointment there was little internal opposition until after her death when nephews began to openly oppose Shoghi Effendi over Bahá'u'lláh's house in Baghdad.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.d.iv"&gt;{{cite web |first=Moojan |last=Momen |title=Covenant, The, and Covenant-breaker |url=http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant#5.%20Dealing%20with%20Covenant-breaking. |accessdate=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some family members disapproved of his marriage to a Westerner, [[Rúhíyyih Khanum|Mary Maxwell]] — daughter of one of the foremost disciples of `Abdu'l-Bahá — in 1937. They claimed that Shoghi Effendi introduced innovations beyond the Iranian roots of the Faith. This gradually resulted in his siblings and cousins disobeying his instructions and marrying into the families of [[Covenant-breaker]]s, many of whom were expelled as Covenant-breakers themselves. However, these disagreements within Shoghi Effendi's family resulted in no attempts to create a schism favouring an alternative leader.  At the time of his death in 1957, he was the only remaining male member of the family of Bahá'u'lláh who had not been expelled. Even his own parents had openly fought against him.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.d.iv"/&gt;

==The founding of the Universal House of Justice==
{{anchor|HouseOfJustice}}
Shoghi Effendi died in 1957 without explicitly appointing a successor Guardian.&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had no children, and during his lifetime all remaining male descendants of Bahá'u'lláh had been [[excommunication|excommunicated]] as [[Covenant-breaker]]s.&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"/&gt; He left no will.&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"/&gt; Shoghi Effendi's appointed [[Hands of the Cause]] unanimously voted it was impossible to legitimately recognize and assent to a successor.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.e"&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|2003|loc=§G.2.e}} [http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant#5.%20Dealing%20with%20Covenant-breaking.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í community was in a situation not dealt with explicitly in the provisions of the Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"/&gt; Furthermore, the [[Universal House of Justice]] had not yet been elected, which represented the only Bahá'í institution authorized to adjudicate on matters not covered by the religion's three central figures.&lt;ref name="ency_hands"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=175–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the transition following the death of Shoghi Effendi in 1957, an explanation of the roles of the Guardian, the Hands of the Cause, and the Universal House of Justice is useful.

===Guardianship===
[[File:Willandtestofabdulbaha.jpg|right|120px]]
{{Main article|Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá}}
Other than allusions in the writings of Bahá'u'lláh to the importance of the [[Aghsán]], the role of the Guardian was not mentioned until the reading of the Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá. Shoghi Effendi later expressed to his wife and others that he had no foreknowledge of the existence of the Institution of Guardianship, least of all that he was appointed as Guardian.&lt;ref name="ency_will"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

`Abdu'l-Bahá warned the Bahá'ís to avoid the problems caused by his half-brother [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí|Muhammad `Alí]].&lt;ref name="ency_will"/&gt; He stipulated the criteria and form for selecting future Guardians, which was to be clear and unambiguous.&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"/&gt; His will required that the Guardian appoint his successor "in his own life-time ... that differences may not arise after his [the Guardian's] passing."&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"/&gt; The appointee was required to be either the first-born son of the Guardian, or one of the [[Aghsán]] (literally: Branches; male descendants of Bahá'u'lláh).&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"/&gt; Finally, `Abdu'l-Bahá left a responsibility to [[Custodians|nine Hands of the Cause]], elected from all of the Hands, who "whether unanimously or by a majority vote, must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the Guardian of the Cause of God hath chosen as his successor."&lt;ref name="ency_hands"/&gt;

The will also vested authority in the Guardian's appointed assistants, known as the [[Hands of the Cause]], giving them the right to "cast out from the congregation of the people of Bahá" anyone they deem in opposition to the Guardian.&lt;ref name="ency_cb"/&gt;

===Relationship between the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice===
The roles of the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice are complementary, the former providing authoritative interpretation, and the latter providing flexibility and the authority to adjudicate on "questions that are obscure and matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book."&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ency_house"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=346–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authority of the two institutions was elucidated by `Abdu'l-Bahá in his will, saying that rebellion and disobedience towards either the Guardian or the Universal House of Justice, is rebellion and disobedience towards God.&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ency_house"/&gt; Shoghi Effendi went into further detail explaining this relationship in ''The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh'', indicating that the institutions are interdependent.&lt;ref name="ency_house"/&gt;

===Role of the Hands of the Cause===
{{anchor|RoleOfHands}}
{{Main article|Hands of the Cause}}
Shortly after Shoghi Effendi's death, the 27 then-living Hands of the Cause (Hands) deliberated over whether or not they could legitimately consent to any successor.&lt;ref name="Momen 89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|Smith|1989|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two members present could translate between English and Persian.{{sfn|Gallagher|Ashcraft|2006|p=201}} Following these events Time Magazine reported that there were debates about two possible candidates for Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine Dec. 9, 1957 [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810155,00.html "In the Hands of the Hands"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 1957, the Hands signed a unanimous proclamation stating that he had died "without having appointed his successor"; that "it is now fallen upon us... to preserve the unity, the security and the development of the Bahá'í World Community and all its institutions"; and that they would elect from among themselves nine Hands who would "exercise ... all such functions, rights and powers in succession to the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith... as are necessary to serve the interests of the Bahá'í World Faith, and this until such time as the Universal House of Justice... may otherwise determine." This body of nine Hands became known as the Hands of the Cause in the Holy Land, sometimes referred to as the [[Custodians]].&lt;ref name="ency_custodians"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same day the Hands passed a unanimous resolution that clarified who would have authority over various executive areas.&lt;ref name="ency_cb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For their authority, the Custodians referred to the ''Will and Testament of `Abdul-Bahá'' which states that "the Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their own number nine persons that shall at all times be occupied in the important services in the work of the Guardian of the Cause of God.”{{Harv|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=190}}{{Harv|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1901-08|p=12}} See: Rabbani, ''Ministry of the Custodians'', 1992, Letter of 28 May 1960, to all National Spiritual Assemblies (pp. 204-206), Letter of 5 July 1960, to all National Spiritual Assemblies (pp. 208-209), Letter of 7 July 1960, to all Hands of the Cause, Cable of 26 July 1960, to all National Spiritual Assemblies (p.223), and Letter of 15 October 1960, to all National Spiritual Assemblies (pp. 231-236)[http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians] In addition, the Guardian had written that the Hands had executive authority in carrying out his directives. {{Harv|Effendi|1982|pp=82–83}}[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/LDG2/ldg2-95.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Among these were:
*"That the entire body of the Hands of the Cause, ... shall determine when and how the International Bahá'í Council shall pass through the successive stages outlined by Shoghi Effendi culminating in the election of the Universal House of Justice"
*"That the authority to expel violators from the Faith shall be vested in the body of nine Hands [The Custodians.], acting on reports and recommendations submitted by Hands from their respective continents."

In their deliberations following Shoghi Effendi's passing they determined that they were not in a position to appoint a successor, only to ratify one, so they advised the Bahá'í community that the [[Universal House of Justice]] would consider the matter after it was established.&lt;ref name="ency_hands"/&gt;

In deciding when and how the [[International Bahá'í Council]] would develop into the Universal House of Justice, the Hands agreed to carry out Shoghi Effendi's plans for moving it from the appointed council, to an officially recognized Bahá'í Court, to a duly elected body, and then to the elected Universal House of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Rabbani|1992|p=37}} [http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians#37] and {{Harvnb|Effendi|1971|pp-7-8}} [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MBW/mbw-5.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1959, referring to the goal of becoming recognized as a [[Israeli judicial system#Non-Jewish religious courts|non-Jewish religious court]] in Israel, they said: "this goal, due to the strong trend towards the [[Secularism in Israel|secularization of Religious Courts]] in this part of the world, might not be achieved."&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Rabbani|1992|p=169}} [http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians#169]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TCoB324"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|1992|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition as a religious court was never achieved, and the International Bahá'í Council was reformed in 1961 as an elected body in preparation for forming the Universal House of Justice.&lt;ref name="ency_council"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hands of the Cause made themselves ineligible for election to both the council and the Universal House of Justice.&lt;ref name="ency_council"/&gt;

Upon the election of the Universal House of Justice at the culmination of the [[Ten Year Crusade]] in 1963, the nine Hands acting as interim head of the religion closed their office.&lt;ref name="ency_hands"/&gt;

===Charles Mason Remey===
&lt;!--other pages link directly to this section. Please avoid changes to its title --&gt;

{{Main article|Mason Remey}}
Charles Mason Remey was among the Hands who signed the unanimous proclamations in 1957, acknowledging that Shoghi Effendi had died without having appointed his successor.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.e"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ency_remey"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also among the [[Custodians|nine Custodians]] initially elected to serve in the Holy Land as interim head of the religion.&lt;ref name="ency_custodians"/&gt;

On 8 April 1960, Remey made a written announcement that he was the second Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith and explained his "status for life as commander in chief of Bahá’í affairs of the world" in this proclamation which he requested to be read in front of the annual US convention in [[Wilmette, Illinois|Wilmette]].&lt;ref&gt;See Charles Mason Remey, ''Proclamation to the Bahá'ís of the World'', p. 1 {{cite web |url=http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/1960_proclamation.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120062722/http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/1960_proclamation.htm |archivedate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He based his claim on his having been appointed President of the first [[International Bahá'í Council]] by Shoghi Effendi in 1951.&lt;ref name="ency_remey"/&gt; The appointed council represented the first international Bahá'í body. Remey believed that his appointment as the council's president meant that he was the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name="ency_remey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Hands of the Cause wrote regarding his reasoning on this point, "If the President of the International Bahá'í Council is ''ipso facto'' the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, then the beloved Guardian, himself, Shoghi Effendi would have had to be the President of this first International Bahá'í Council." {{Harv|Rabbani|1992|p=234}} [http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians&amp;chapter=4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the authority of the Hands of the Cause, Remey wrote in his letter that the Hands "have no authority vested in themselves... save under the direction of the living Guardian of the Faith."&lt;ref&gt;See Charles Mason Remey, ''Proclamation to the Bahá'ís of the World'', [http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/1960_proclamation.htm p. 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120062722/http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/1960_proclamation.htm |date=2008-11-20 }} and also "Role of the Hands of the Cause".&lt;/ref&gt; He further commanded the Bahá'ís to abandon plans for establishing the Universal House of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;See Charles Mason Remey, ''Proclamation to the Bahá'ís of the World'', pp. 6-7 {{cite web |url=http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/1960_proclamation.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120062722/http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/1960_proclamation.htm |archivedate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remey never addressed the requirement that Guardians should be male-descendants of Bahá'u'lláh, of whom Remey was not. His followers later referred to letters and public statements of `Abdu'l-Bahá calling him "my son" as evidence that he had been implicitly adopted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/index.htm |title=Brent Mathieu, ''Biography of Charles Mason Remey'' |access-date=2006-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131148/http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/index.htm |archive-date=2006-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but these claims were almost universally rejected by the body of the Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="ency_hands"/&gt;

In response, and after having made many prior efforts to convince Remey to withdraw his claim,&lt;ref name="TCoB387"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|1992|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoC370"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|2000|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Custodians took action and sent a cablegram to the National Spiritual Assemblies on 26 July 1960.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harv|Rabbani|1992|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later the Custodians sent Mason Remey a letter informing him of their unanimous decision to declare him a Covenant-breaker.&lt;ref name="ency_remey"/&gt; They cited the Will and Testament of `Abdul-Bahá, the unanimous joint resolutions of November 25, 1957, and their authority in carrying out the work of the Guardian&lt;ref name="LDG 82-83"&gt;See {{Harvnb|Effendi|1982|pp=82–83}} [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/LDG2/ldg2-95.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as their justification. Anyone who accepted Remey's claim to the Guardianship was also expelled.&lt;ref name="ency_remey"/&gt;

Remey attracted about 100 followers in the United States and a few others in Pakistan and Europe.{{sfn|Gallagher|Ashcraft|2006|p=201}} Remey maintained his claim to Guardianship, and went on to establish what came to be known as the Orthodox Bahá'ís Under the Hereditary Guardianship, which later broke into several other divisions based on succession disputes within the groups that followed Remey.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.e"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ency_remeyite"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially disturbing, the mainstream Bahá'ís paid little attention to his movement within a few years. As of 2006 his followers represent two or three groups that maintain little contact with each other, comprising a few hundred members collectively.{{sfn|Gallagher|Ashcraft|2006|p=201}} 

===Decision of the Universal House of Justice===
[[File:firstUHJ.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Original members of the first Universal House of Justice, 1963.]]
{{Main article|Universal House of Justice}}
The Bahá'í institutions and believers around the world pledged their loyalty to the [[Hands of the Cause]], who dedicated the next few years to completing [[Shoghi Effendi|Shoghi Effendi's]] [[Ten Year Crusade]], culminating with the election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963. It was at this time the [[Custodians]] officially passed their authority as the head of the Faith to the Universal House of Justice,&lt;ref name="ency_custodians"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; which soon announced that it could not appoint or legislate to make possible the appointment of a second Guardian to succeed Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref name="ency_house"/&gt;

A short time later it elaborated on the situation in which the Guardian would die without being able to appoint a successor, saying that it was an obscure question not covered by Bahá'í scriptures, that no institution or individual at the time could have known the answer, and that it therefore had to be referred to the Universal House of Justice, whose election was confirmed by references in Shoghi Effendi's letters that after 1963 the Bahá'í world would be led by international plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;The Universal House of Justice, Letter of 9 March 1965, ''Messages from the Universal House of Justice, 1963-1986'', [http://bahai-library.com/uhj_messages_1963-86_full#s23.3 p. 50]&lt;/ref&gt;

===A break in the line of Guardians===
Mason Remey and his successors asserted that a living Guardian is essential for the Bahá'í community, and that the Bahá'í writings required it. The basis of these claims were almost universally rejected by the body of the Bahá'ís,&lt;ref name="ency_hands"/&gt; for whom the restoration of scripturally sanctioned leadership of the Universal House of Justice proved more attractive than the  claims of Mason Remey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|Smith|1989|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House commented that its own authority was not dependent on the presence of a Guardian,&lt;ref name="ency_house"/&gt; and that its legislative functioning was unaffected by the absence of a Guardian.&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"/&gt; It stated that in its legislation it would be able to turn to the mass of interpretation left by Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"/&gt; The Universal House of Justice addressed this issue further early after its election clarifying that "there is nowhere any promise or guarantee that the line of Guardians would endure forever; on the contrary there are clear indications that the line could be broken."&lt;ref name="TCoB390"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|1992|p=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Universal House of Justice, Letter of 7 December 1969, ''Messages from the Universal House of Justice, 1963-1986'', [http://bahai-library.com/uhj_messages_1963-86_full#s75.12 p. 158]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Universal House of Justice specifically refers to [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-5.html#gr42 paragraph 42] of the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]] as evidence that Bahá'u'lláh anticipated that the line of Guardians was not guaranteed forever by providing for the disposition of the religion's endowments in the absence of the [[Aghsán]].{{Harv|Taherzadeh|1992|p=390}}  See also Notes [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-83.html 66] and [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-84.html 67] of the ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'', pp. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further development of Remey's followers==
All those that professed belief in Mason Remey as the second Guardian did not accept the [[Universal House of Justice]] established in 1963.

Among the Bahá'ís who accepted Mason Remey as the second Guardian, several further divisions have occurred based on conflicting opinions of legitimacy and succession of authority.&lt;ref name="Barrett p. 247"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.e"/&gt; They began to split into smaller groups even before his death in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Warburg |2004}} [http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/Baha'i.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Small Remeyite groups are now largely confined to the United States.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.e"/&gt; Some of these divisions are described below.

The ''Encyclopædia Iranica'' reports the following:
:Remey died in 1974, having appointed a third Guardian, but the number of adherents to the Orthodox faction remains extremely small. Although successful in Pakistan, the Remeyites seem to have attracted no followers in Iran. Other small groups have broken away from the main body from time to time, but none of these has attracted a sizeable following.&lt;ref name="maceoin" /&gt;

Remey died at the age of 99 living many of his last years in Florence, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Special Collections: Milton S. Eisenhower Library |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University |url=http://www.library.jhu.edu/collections/specialcollections/manuscripts/msregisters/ms375.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024055044/http://www.library.jhu.edu/collections/specialcollections/manuscripts/msregisters/ms375.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-10-24 |accessdate=2007-09-26 |year=1995 |first=Joan |last=Grattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under the Hereditary Guardianship===
In 1962 Mason Remey asked his supporters in the United States to organize themselves and elect a "National Spiritual Assembly Under the Hereditary Guardianship" (NSAUHG). The Assembly was incorporated in New Mexico in 1964.

In 1964 the NSAUHG filed a lawsuit against the National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) of the Bahá'ís of the United States to receive the legal title to the Bahá'í House of Worship in Illinois, and all other property owned by the NSA. The NSA counter-sued and won.&lt;ref name="1966 court"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/bahais_vs_new-mexico_covenant-breakers Bahá'ís vs New Mexico Group] District Court, N.D. Illinois, E. Div. No. 64 C 1878. Decided June 28, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Remey asked the NSAUHG to dissolve, as well as the second International Bahá'í Council that he had appointed with Joel Marangella, residing in France, as president. Marangella, Donald Harvey, and Jacques Soghomonian had previously served on the National Spiritual Assembly of France (in 1961) and had been declared Covenant-breakers when they accepted Mason Remey as the next Guardian.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.e"/&gt;

After 1966, some followers of Mason Remey began forming their own groups based on different understandings of succession.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.e"/&gt;

===Orthodox Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main article| Orthodox Bahá'í Faith}}

Joel Marangella was president of Remey's "Second International Bahá'í Council", and claimed in 1969 to have been secretly appointed by Remey as Guardian several years earlier. His supporters came to be known as Orthodox Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="ency_remey" /&gt; Membership data is scarce. One source estimated them at no more than 100 members in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.momen.org/relstud/covenant.htm THE COVENANT], Moojan Momen. Quoting ''Chicago Tribune'', 10 June 1988, section 1, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and the group claimed a United States membership of about 40 in a 2007 court case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120219232042/http://www.truebahai.info/court/54-1-surreply-brief.pdf], US District Court for Northern District Court of Illinois Eastern Division, Civil Action No. 64 C 1878: Orthodox Bahá'í Respondents' Surreply Memorandum to NSA's Reply Memorandum, p2 para 2 line 15&lt;/ref&gt; Websites claiming to represent the Orthodox community indicate followers in the United States and India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxbahai.com The National Bahá'í Council of the Orthodox Bahá'í Faith]&lt;/ref&gt; Joel Marangella died in San Diego, California on Sept 1, 2013.

===Bahá'ís Under the Provisions of the Covenant===
[[Leland Jensen]] accepted Remey's claim to the Guardianship and later left the group. In 1969 he was convicted of "a lewd and lascivious act" for sexually molesting a 15-year-old female patient,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fastcase.com/Yahoo/Start.aspx?C=26917489637405405daded611067aa76e77e8a5606aee00f&amp;D=77eca924714beb4591a4da5747d53c9c77862a89c3a754d6&amp;AffiliateConst=Yahoo ''State v.

It was in prison that Jensen converted several inmates to his ideas of being what he called the "Establisher" of the Bahá'í Faith, stemming from his belief that the Bahá'í administrative order became corrupted. After being paroled in 1973 and before Remey's death, Jensen formed a group called the Bahá'ís Under the Provisions of the Covenant.&lt;ref name="stone271"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|2000| p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, Jensen believed Remey's adopted son Joseph Pepe was the Guardian, an idea that Pepe rejected several times. In 1991 Jensen appointed followers to a [[Bahá'ís Under the Provisions of the Covenant#sIBC|second International Bahá'í Council]] (sIBC), intending that it would grow into an elected Universal House of Justice after a [[nuclear holocaust]].&lt;ref name="stone271" /&gt; Jensen died in 1996.

A researcher has noted that since 1980 BUPC membership has never exceeded 200 nationwide,&lt;ref name="stone271"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvard researchers have noted a community of 30 members in the headquarters of [[Missoula, Montana]] in 2003, as well as the existence of BUPC adherents in Denver and Alaska.

===Jacques Soghomonian===
Donald Harvey (d.1991), was appointed by Remey as "Third Guardian" in 1967.&lt;ref name="ency_remey" /&gt;  After Harvey's death in 1991, leadership of this group went to Jacques Soghomonian, a resident of Marseilles, France.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.e"/&gt; Soghomonian died in 2013 and passed the successorship to E.S. Yazdani.&lt;ref&gt;http://guardianshipofthebahaifaith.org/ridvan/Ridvan%2020%20December%202013%20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Remey Society===
Francis Spataro of New York City, who supported Donald Harvey's claim as Remey's successor, independently organized "The Remey Society" after losing favor with Harvey. Spataro published books about Charles Mason Remey,&lt;ref&gt;*Spataro, Francis C. (2003).

When Spataro began to preach that Charles Mason Remey was a "Prophet", Harvey cut all ties to Spataro. He then continued to promote the life and works of Charles Mason Remey. In 1995 Francis Spataro became an [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]] priest and left the Bahá'í religion altogether. The Remey Society is now extinct.

===Free Bahá'ís===
{{Main article| Free Bahá'ís}}
The term '''Free Bahá'ís''' has been used by or about a small number of [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] that have attempted [[Bahá'í Faith|schism]] from the main body of believers of the Bahá'í Faith. More specifically, it is a form of belief that rejects the authority of [[Shoghi Effendi]], appointed in 1921 to lead the community following the death of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]. 

The term was first used by [[Hermann Zimmer]], who revived the earlier claims of [[Ruth White (Bahá'í author)|Ruth White]] that the ''[[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá]]'' was forged. White's claim was widely rejected by other Bahá'ís of the time, including Bahá'ís who, like her, were enemies of Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref name=Covenant&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant |title=Covenant, The, and Covenant-breaker |last=Momen |first=Moojan |authorlink=Moojan Momen |date=1995 |website=Bahá'í Library Online |publisher=|access-date= December 22, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="child-covenant"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taherzadeh |first=Adib |authorlink=Adib Taherzadeh |year=2000 |title=The Child of the Covenant |publisher=George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=0-85398-439-5 |pages=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The A to Z of the Baha'i Faith |first=Hugh C. |last=Adamson |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2009 |isbn=0810868539 |p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="covenant-bahaullah"&gt;{{cite book |author=Taherzadeh, Adib |authorlink=Adib Taherzadeh |year=1972 |title=The Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=0-85398-344-5 |page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; White was able to gather the support of a single Bahá'í in Germany, Wilhelm Herrigel, who took up her cause; only a few Bahá'ís followed him, and most repudiated him following his death in 1932.&lt;ref name="balyuzi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Honor of the Late Hasan M.

===The Man===
"The House of Mankind and the Universal Palace of Order" followed Jamshid Ma'ani and John Carré, but appears now to be defunct. In the early 1970s a Persian man named Jamshid Ma'ani claimed he was "The Man"; or a new [[Manifestation of God]]. He gained a few dozen Iranian Bahá'í followers. John Carré heard of Jamshid, and wrote a book trying to get other Bahá'ís to accept a new, third Manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;See online at [http://www.maitreya.org/english/Other%20Evidences/Bahai/greatest_name.htm  The third Manifestation of the Revelation of the Greatest Name, soon to appear]&lt;/ref&gt; Carré even invited "The Man" to live in his home in California, but soon concluded, after living with "The Man" for four months, that "The Man" was not at all godly or spiritual and certainly not a Manifestation of God. "The Man" went back to Iran, and Carré ended all association with him.&lt;ref name="Momen 2003 G.2.e" /&gt;

===Reginald ("Rex") King===
Rex King rejected all claimants to the Guardianship after Shoghi Effendi including Remey. He claimed that he, Rex King, was a "regent" pending the emergence of the second Guardian who was in "occultation". His group called themselves the Orthodox Bahá'í Faith under the Regency. King died in 1977 and appointed four of his family as the council of regents. This group today calls itself the "Tarbiyat Baha'i Community".&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.e"/&gt;

Biblical translations into the [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages of North and South America]] have been produced since the 16th century.

==Algonquian languages==

===Abenaki===
Mark, translated by Peter Wzokhilain, was printed in 1830. It was republished in 2011 by [[Jesse Bruchac]].

===Anishinaabemowin===

====Algonquin====

Roger and Ruth Spielmann of Wycliffe Bible Translators together with local Algonquin people, translated a new translation into modern [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]]. John was published in 1993. The complete New Testament was published in 1998.

====Ojibwa====
The first portion of the Bible in [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwa]], part of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language family in Canada, was the Gospels of St Matthew and St John, translated by [[Peter Jones (missionary)|Peter]] and [[John Jones (Ojibwa chief)|John Jones]] and printed in 1829-31. There are three complete translations of the New Testament in this language: One by Edwin James in 1833, another by Henry Blatchford in 1844 (reprinted in 1856 and 1875), and a third by Frederick O'Meara in 1854 (reprinted in 1874). O'Meara also translated the Psalms (1856) and the Pentateuch (1861), and Robert McDonald translated the Twelve Minor Prophets (1874). Jim Keesic translated about fifty percent of the old testament, and revised the New Testament. This was published by the [[Canadian Bible Society]] in August 2008. Bob Bryce and Henry Hostetler also worked on this project.

Jonathan Meeker's translation of Matthew and John in the Ottawa dialect appeared in 1841-44. P. Jones's Ottawa dialect translation of Genesis was published in 1835 by the Toronto Auxiliary Bible Society.

Mark and John have also been translated into the Ojicree dialect.

===Arapaho===
The first Bible portion in [[Arapaho language]] ([[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family) was translated by [[John Kliewer]], a [[Mennonite]] [[missionary]], who translated [[Matthew 9|Matthew 9:1-8]]. This was published with commentary in a ten-page pamphlet by Wm. J. Krehbiel in 1888. The first book was done by [[John Roberts]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] missionary, and [[Michael White Hawk]] who translated the [[Gospel of Luke]] into Arapaho language for the [[American Bible Society]] in 1903.

Mark was published in 1979. Acts 1-15 in 1981. 1 Timothy was printed in 1984. 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon were published as one volume in 1991. James, Colossians and Galatians were published in 2005. It is hoped that the New Testament can be dedicated in 2012.

===Dakota/Lakota===
The [[Dakota language]] Bible translation was started with Thomas Williamson and [[Joseph Renville]], a fur trader of French and Dakotan descent. Williamson first modified the Latin alphabet to "work" for Dakota, he then spent day after day for two or three winters in Renville's warehouse, reading verse by verse from his French Bible. Renville would then give the Dakota, and Williamson would write it down. They finished Mark and John this way. In 1837 Williamson was joined by [[Stephen Return Riggs|Stephen Riggs]]. Both of them learned Dakota, and then compared the tentative translation with the original Greek.

In 1843 they offered a corrected version of Luke and John to the [[American Bible Society]] to be printed. It took nearly 40 years before the full Bible was translated. Williamson never lived to see it finished, as he died in 1879. Their work was revised by Williamson's son, the Rev. John Williamson.&lt;ref&gt;The Centennial History of the American Bible Society By Henry Otis Dwight, pg. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

Genesis 1842; Luke and John 1843; New Testament 1865; Holy Bible 1879;

Eugene Buechel published "Wowapi Wakan Wicowoyake Yuptecelapi Kin" (The Abridged Bible Stories) in the Lakhota dialect in 1924. It included a selection of texts modeled after the German ''Biblische Geschichte''.

Mercy Poorman, Velma Young, and Ed L. Bausell translated Riggs and Williamson's 1887 John from the Dakota dialect into the Lakota dialect. This was published in 1997 by Tiospaye Bible Baptist. The Lakota Bible Translation Project has translated various small booklets with selections from scripture, and in 2006 published Luke's gospel. The Lakota Bible Translation Project's translators include Jerry Yellowhawk, Rosalie Little Thunder, and Ben Black Bear.

==Language Isolates==

===Haida (language isolate)===
The first portion of the Bible in [[Haida language]] (Language isolate) of Alaska, 500 copies of Matthew, became available in 1891. It was translated by [[Charles Harrison (missionary)]], a [[Church Missionary Society]] missionary at [[Masset]]. Harrison was sent out in 1882, and returned to England in 1891, being succeeded by the Rev. [[John Henry Keen]]. Harrison also published a book entitled "Old Testament Stories in the Haida language", this was published after he had already returned to England, in 1893. In 1897 Keen's version of the Acts was published: till then Matthew was the only printed book in the language. Keen also prepared Luke, John, 1 Corinthians, Psalms, and parts of Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;In Wake of the War Canoe, pg 262, by Collison, William Henry. 1915&lt;/ref&gt; (see account of his method of translation, Report of the British and Foreign Bible Society, 1898, p.&amp;nbsp;317); Luke and John were published in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;In Our Tongues, By George Anthony King, [[British and Foreign Bible Society]], pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear what happened to Keen's manuscripts for Genesis, Psalms, and 1 Corinthians, as they were never published.

===Keres (language isolate)===
John Menaul translated Exodus 20 (the ten commandments) and Matthew 5 (The sermon on the mount) into Keres. It was published in 1883 at the Laguna Mission Press.

Portions of the Bible were translated into Eastern Keres in the 1930s by H. Carroll Whitener. Matthew was published in 1933 and John was published in 1935 and Acts in 1936.  Portions into Western Keres were translated from the 1960s with the first full book being completed in 1997.

===Zuñi (language isolate)===
In 1906, Andrew VanderWagen, with the help of Nich Tumaka, translated Mark and perhaps other portions into the [[Zuñi language]] (a [[language isolate]]) of western New Mexico and eastern Arizona. In the 1930s and 1940s, George Yff and Rex Natewa, with the help of [[Wycliffe Bible Translators|Wycliffe Bible Translator]] Carroll Whitener translated Matthew and John. These translations had many problems, including the fact that they used grammatical sentence structure based on English instead of on Zuñi.&lt;ref&gt;A Church Growth Study of the Zuni Indians, Ralph B. Terry http://bible.ovu.edu/terry/thesis/3_2-since1870.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

After extensive study of the [[Zuñi language]], and massive recordings of their folklore, and after creating a writing system that worked for their language, Curtis Cook translated the gospel of Mark (published in 1970), John (published 2011) and Acts (in 1978) into the Zuñi language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://story.arizonaherald.com/p.x/ct/9/id/86e981acd40b0ee7/cid/085cec8e58ce1f5a/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120716035845/http://story.arizonaherald.com/p.x/ct/9/id/86e981acd40b0ee7/cid/085cec8e58ce1f5a/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 July 2012|title=Deseret Morning News - Arizona man helps preserve Zuni language&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=arizonaherald.com|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook's chief language helper was Lorenzo Chavez&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicnetwork.org/index.php?loc=kb&amp;view=v&amp;id=17201&amp;fto=2786&amp;|title=Strategicnetwork.org|work=strategicnetwork.org|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Griffin''' is a fictional character from the American [[animated series|animated television series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. An anthropomorphic white dog voiced by [[Seth MacFarlane]], he is one of the show's main characters as a member of the [[Griffin family]]. He primarily works in the series as a less-than-adept writer struggling to find himself, attempting essays, novels, screenplays, and newspaper articles.

&lt;!--"Role in Family Guy" and character conception x 2--&gt;He first appeared on television, along with the rest of the family, in a 15-minute [[short film|short]] on December 20, 1998. Brian was created and designed by MacFarlane himself. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], based on [[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve|''The Life of Larry'' and ''Larry &amp; Steve'']], two shorts made by MacFarlane featuring a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the green light, the Griffin family appeared in the episode "[[Death Has a Shadow]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dushaw|first=Brian|last2=Dushaw|first2=Brian|last3=Dushaw|first3=Brian|last4=Dushaw|first4=Brian|last5=Dushaw|first5=Brian|last6=Dushaw|first6=Brian|last7=Dushaw|first7=Brian|last8=Dushaw|first8=Brian|last9=Dushaw|first9=Brian|date=2010-12-31|title=A Global Ocean Acoustic Observing Network|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5270/oceanobs09.cwp.25|journal=Proceedings of OceanObs'09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society|publisher=European Space Agency|volume=Brian|pages=Brian|doi=10.5270/oceanobs09.cwp.25|isbn=9783869872001|via=Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian's appearance is a redesign of Steve the dog from MacFarlane's previous show.

Brian has been featured in many items of merchandise for ''Family Guy'', and he is considered to be one of the show's biggest merchandising icons. He has also made [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] appearances in the other MacFarlane-produced shows, such as ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''.

As a character, Brian has been very well received by critics and fans. When Brian was [[kill off|killed off]] in the [[Family Guy (season 12)|season 12]] episode "[[Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Life of Brian]]", the events of the episode received substantial attention from the media and elicited strongly negative reactions from fans of the show. Brian subsequently returned two episodes later, in "[[Christmas Guy]]", after [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] travels back in time to save him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Life of Brian |series=Family Guy |network=Fox |date=November 24, 2013 |season=12 |number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Christmas Guy |series=Family Guy |network=Fox |date=December 15, 2013 |season=12 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in ''Family Guy''==
[[File:2nd-Toyota-Prius.jpg|thumb|right|A Toyota Prius, similar to the one Brian drives. However, this image is real life, but the producers have made it comical.]]
Brian is a white-furred [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog. He can talk, generally walks on his hind legs (using his front legs as arms), has opposable thumbs, drives a second-generation [[Toyota Prius]] (with the [[Vehicle registration plates of Rhode Island|license plate]] "BRI-DOG"), and often acts more rationally than the other characters in the series. He is the pet dog and close friend of the [[Griffin family]], and, although anthropomorphic animals are not a regular element of the show, Brian's human attributes receive little acknowledgment and no explanation; he is largely treated as a human character. Brian has a particularly close relationship with [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], and many of the show's sub-plots center around them. They are occasionally at the center of the plot, for instance in the [[Road to... (Family Guy)|"Road to..."]] episodes. Brian and Stewie have a [[love/hate relationship]] in which they constantly bicker and insult each other, and yet show affection to each other several times. In the episode "[[Brian and Stewie]]", they admit that they love each other as friends, and give each other's lives purpose.

Brian is very fond of [[Martini (cocktail)|dry martinis]] and is seen to have some issues in various episodes when he is told or forced to stop drinking. These episodes suggest that Brian is possibly an [[alcoholic]]. He smokes occasionally, although in the episode "[[Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington]]", after seeing [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] promoting a corrupt cigarette company, he quit smoking, a habit he resumed at the end of that episode. He also occasionally smokes [[marijuana]]. After a brief stint as a drug sniffing dog, he developed a severe [[cocaine]] addiction, but after spending time in rehab he managed to quit.

He is the son of Coco and Biscuit, who were normal dogs, though Brian's human attributes have been present since he was a puppy. He claims his father is [[racist]], and Brian seems to have inherited these tendencies. Brian received an [[Ivy League]] education, having attended [[Brown University]], as seen in "[[Brian Goes Back to College]]" but was shy one course from graduating. He is also an Iraq War veteran because Stewie signed them both up for the Army, in "[[Saving Private Brian]]". ''Family Guy'' uses a [[floating timeline]] in which the characters do not age much, so the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. However, several of the characters, such as [[Meg Griffin]], have aged two to three years since the show's [[Death Has a Shadow|pilot episode]], while others, such as [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] and Brian, have aged very little. At the start of the series, Brian was 7, but is currently 8 years old.&lt;ref name= book&gt;{{cite book|title=Family Guy: The Official Episode Guide, Seasons 1–3|author=Callaghan, Steve|isbn=0-06-083305-X|chapter=A Hero Sits Next Door|page=32|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=New York City|year=2005|authorlink=Steve Callaghan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. An example of this is when in "Brian: Portrait of a Dog", Peter is shown in a flashback finding a fully grown Brian as a stray. However, in "The Man with Two Brians", Brian tries to regain attention from the Griffin family by showing them home videos of him as a puppy, although none of the videos of him as a puppy showed any member of the Griffin family, so it is possible that the videos were filmed by a previous owner. He also has a human son named Dylan, who was a regular [[marijuana]] smoker, before Brian managed to turn Dylan's life around, from a violent, uneducated teenager, to a well-mannered friendly young man. Stewie is very confused upon how Brian as an 8-year-old dog can have a teenage son, and Brian's remark about it being in dog years confuses him even further.

Brian is a [[modern American liberalism|political liberal]], who supports legalizing marijuana and [[gay marriage]] and ending the "[[war on terror]]". He is also an [[atheist]], although in the episode "[[April in Quahog]]" he starts praying out of panic when, as an April Fool's joke, news anchors Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons trick the entire town of Quahog into believing that the world is about to end.

===Writing career===
Brian is an aspiring but struggling writer – this is said to be a reference to [[Snoopy]] from ''[[Peanuts]]''. Brian is unemployed, but he is often seen writing various novels, screenplays or essays. His difficult writing career and apparent lack of talent is used as a recurring joke throughout the series. In the episode "[[Play it Again, Brian]]", Brian won an award for an essay he wrote, though he later admits that he [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/03/03/family-guy-play-it-again-brian/|title=Family Guy: Play it Again, Brian – VIDEO|work=[[TV Squad]]|author=Trechak, Brad|date=March 3, 2008|accessdate=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian has written since college, as told in "[[Brian Griffin's House of Payne]]", in which his TV drama pilot is accepted (and then drastically amended) by a local studio.

In the episode "[[Movin' Out (Brian's Song)|Movin' Out]]", Brian starts writing his book ''Faster Than The Speed of Love'', which is revealed to be a rip-off of the ''[[Iron Eagle]]'' films, specifically ''[[Aces: Iron Eagle III]]''.

In the episode "[[420 (Family Guy)|420]]", Brian finally publishes his novel ''Faster Than the Speed of Love'', and the novel is shipped, but it is critically panned and does not sell a single copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-8-2008/episode-12-420/27594853|publisher=[[Film.com]]|title= 420 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Dog Gone]]", he receives an invitation (from the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence) to an award ceremony celebrating his novel. Brian, convinced that he is a great writer, attempts to gain the family's interest in this piece of news but fails to do so. Once he arrives at the "award ceremony", however, he discovers that he has misunderstood the meaning of the word "[[Mental retardation|special]]".

Later in the episode "[[Brian Griffin's House of Payne]]", he writes a television script entitled "What I Learned on Jefferson Street", and it was shown to [[CBS|a TV network]] who picked it up after reading it. Although the script was good, the finished product was not, as [[James Woods]] intervened and turned Brian's script into a farcical comedy piece revolving around Woods going back to college, where he is roommates with a monkey named Mr. Teenie. In the episode "[[Brian Writes a Bestseller]]", Brian writes a bestselling self-help book, ''Wish It, Want It, Do It'', which he wrote in a few hours and consists mostly of blank pages. The book is an immediate success, but Brian lets the fame go to his head. He eventually causes the downfall of his book's popularity, and things go back to normal. It is mentioned again to get a girl in "[[Yug Ylimaf]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d-panabaker.org/2010/03/29/danielle-panabaker-on-family-guy/ |title=Danielle Panabaker on Family Guy |publisher=D-Panabaker.org |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122232622/http://d-panabaker.org/2010/03/29/danielle-panabaker-on-family-guy/ |archivedate=November 22, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Behind the scenes of 'Family Guy' Character 'voice' star to speak|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=November 19, 2006|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AD&amp;p_theme=ad&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=11597438A790F3B8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian's latest literary attempt came in the episode "[[Brian's Play]]", where Brian writes a play entitled ''A Passing Fancy''. The play becomes very popular in Quahog; however, Brian is upset when he realizes that Stewie had since written a play which was better than his. Stewie's play was eventually shown on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Brian became depressed, as he only wanted to be a good writer for the few years which remain of his life, and not have to be overshadowed by Stewie, who has his whole life ahead of him.

===Voice===
The voice of Brian is provided by series creator Seth MacFarlane, who also provides the voices of many other characters including [[Peter Griffin]], [[Stewie Griffin]], and [[Glenn Quagmire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cartoonist MacFarlane funny guy of Fox's 'Family' Subversive voice of series is his|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Graham, Jefferson|date=January 29, 1999|page=E7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian's voice is MacFarlane's normal speaking voice. [[William H. Macy]] auditioned unsuccessfully for the role.&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23365 |title=Seth MacFarlane |accessdate=September 26, 2007 |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |date=January 26, 2006 |work=The A.V.

In the episode "[[Road to the Multiverse]]", Brian was voiced by Japanese actor [[Kotaro Watanabe]] in a scene where everything in the world is Japanese.&lt;ref name="cast"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tv.yahoo.com/episode/217820/castcrew |title=Family Guy – Road to the Multiverse – Cast and Crew |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615055718/http://tv.yahoo.com/episode/217820/castcrew |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote= "Man's best friend is a poor understatement when it comes to dealing with Peter's constant mission to paint the world with all sorts of stupid. You'd think witnessing so much anti-thought would cut the poor guy a break, but no. And that's part of the character's charm: Always being on hand for the solid quip or sarcastic commentary. Having lived with the Griffins for many years, and being accepted (and audibly heard more than Stewie for some reason) as a peer, Brian has become a character as important to fans as the show's titular star". |source= Ahsan Haque, ''[[IGN]]''&lt;ref name=matee&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IGN|date=|author=Haque, Ahsan|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/987/987014p8.html|title= Top 25 Family Guy Characters|accessdate=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]] has given Brian a positive review, calling him the best talking man-dog.&lt;ref name=matee/&gt; He also praised Brian's adventures with Stewie calling them, "center of many of the show's best bits".&lt;ref name=matee/&gt; Haque later made a list titled "Family Guy: Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures", where he stated that "Brian and Stewie paired together has always been a winning formula for Family Guy". They also praised the selection of Brian to play [[Chewbacca]] as they stated in the "[[Blue Harvest]]" review. In their list of "What Else Should Family Guy Make Fun Of?", IGN commented that Brian would be perfect to play [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], if ''Family Guy'' ever decides to make a [[James Bond]] parody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/106/1068679p1.html|title=What Else Should Family Guy Make Fun Of?|work=[[IGN]]|author=Haque, Ahsan|date=February 11, 2010|accessdate=February 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in a review of the seventh season, Haque wrote that Brian "unfortunately was terribly misused this season. He's degenerated into nothing more than a soapbox for the political views of the writers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/986/986840p1.html|title=Family Guy: Season 7 Review|publisher=IGN|author=Haque, Ahsan|date=May 28, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the eighth season, following his transition into a heel character, Ramsey Isler stated that Brian "left his lofty position as the voice of reason and switched to pretentious loser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/109/1093953p1.html|title=Family Guy: Season 8 Review|publisher=IGN|author=Haque, Ahsan|date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd VanDerWerff of [[The A.V.

===Commendations===
In IGN's "''Family Guy'': Top 10 Fights", Brian's fight with Stewie in the episode "[[Patriot Games (Family Guy)|Patriot Games]] (season 4, 2006) is ranked number 5.&lt;ref name="Fights"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IGN|date=|author=Haque, Ahsan|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/100/1005692p1.html|title= Family Guy: Top 10 Fights|accessdate=November 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[IGN]]'s "Top 10 musical moments in ''Family Guy''", Brian ranked number 6, number 5, and number 3 with the songs, "The Freakin' FCC" from "[[PTV (Family Guy)|PTV]]" (season 4, 2005), "Never Gonna Give You Up" from "[[Meet the Quagmires]]" (season 5, 2007) and "This House Is Freakin' Sweet" from "[[Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater]]" (season 2, 1999) respectively.&lt;ref name="Musical Moments"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ahsan|last=Haque |title= Family Guy: Top 10 Musical Moments|website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/949/949158p10.html |accessdate=November 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a list of the Top 25 ''Family Guy'' characters compiled by IGN, Brian was placed second on the list (behind Stewie).

===Death and return===
{{Main|Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Christmas Guy}}

Brian's death was the main focus in the [[Family Guy (season 12)|season twelve]] episode "[[Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Life of Brian]]". After Stewie destroys his time machine because of the risks of changing history and losing their lives, Brian and Stewie arrive home with a street hockey net they had found in a dump, where Stewie destroyed his time machine for good. As he is setting it up, Brian is struck by a reckless driver in a [[hit and run]] and later succumbs to his injuries at the veterinary clinic. Stewie is unable to rebuild the time machine as he cannot acquire a new power supply. After a month of mourning the loss of their beloved pet, the family replaces Brian with a new dog, named Vinny. The death of Brian in the episode "[[Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Life of Brian]]" was met with massive opposition and anger from ''Family Guy'' fans around the world, many of whom threatened to [[boycott]] the show due to Brian's absence. Family Guy's official Facebook and Twitter pages were bombarded with messages and comments from fans demanding that they bring Brian back. Hostile messages were also directed towards Family Guy's producing staff, including the show's creator, [[Seth MacFarlane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latintimes.com/articles/10569/20131124/brian-griffin-dies-family-guy-twitter-lashes-out-seth-macfarlane.htm#.Up3bLNJdU4k |title=Brian Griffin Dies On 'Family Guy': Twitter Lashes Out at Seth MacFarlane |date=November 25, 2013|author=Maria Valdez|work=[[Latin Times]]|accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane later thanked fans "for caring so much about the canine Griffin, he is overcome with gratitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/12/15/family-guy-seth-macfarlane-reveals-he-killed-brian-griffin-to-teach-fans-a-lesson/ |title=Family Guy: Seth MacFarlane Reveals He Killed Brian Griffin To Teach Fans A Lesson |date=December 16, 2013|last=|first=|work=ComicBook|accessdate=2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fan petitions sprang up within hours of "Life of Brian"'s first airing, also receiving media attention including most prominently a [[Change.org]] petition directed towards Seth MacFarlane,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-family-guy-brian-death-protest-20131125,0,3694745.story#axzz2lhlkPyuS|title='Family Guy' fans protest death of Brian the dog|date=November 25, 2013|author=Patrick Kevin Day|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/family-guy-fans-protest-death-brian-dog-215224563.html |title='Family Guy' fans protest death of Brian the dog |date=November 25, 2013 |work=AFP |publisher=Yahoo!

Two episodes later in "[[Christmas Guy]]", Stewie still misses Brian dearly and spots a past incarnation of himself who has traveled forward in time to Christmas (An event referenced in "Life of Brian"). Stealing the time machine's return pad from his past self while Vinny provides a distraction, Stewie goes back in time and saves Brian's life, at the cost of erasing himself from history. Brian is extremely grateful for being saved, but Stewie of this timeline finds Brian's affections unnerving, not knowing the reason behind them. The episode ends with the family sitting around their Christmas tree with everything back to normal. After "Christmas Guy" aired, Seth MacFarlane [[Twitter|tweeted]], "you didn't really think we'd kill off Brian, did you? Jesus, we'd have to be fucking high."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/family-guy-brian-lives-665836 |title=Family Guy: Brian Lives |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
Brian is featured in a ''Family Guy'' parody in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]". The scene depicted a conversation between Peter and Brian leading to one of the show's trademark cut-away gags; like Peter, Brian was rendered in the distinct animation style of ''South Park''. Brian also appeared in one episode of Seth MacFarlene's other animated sitcom, ''[[American Dad!]]'' titled ''The People vs. Martin Sugar.'' When Stan Smith begins to mention his list of "Top 10 Fictitious Dogs," with the last one being Brian, he briefly appears confused asking Stan, "Uh, do I know you?", which is an homage to MacFarlane himself since he voices both characters.

Brian was also featured, along with [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], in an advertisement for [[Wheat Thins]]. He and Stewie also introduced the [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards|2007 Emmy Awards]] with a song which recapped the events in television, over the past year. The song was adapted from the one sung by Brian, Stewie and [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] in the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[PTV (Family Guy)|PTV]]".

===Merchandise===
Brian is featured on the ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'' CD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pe.com/entertainment/stories/PE_Fea_Ent_D_familyguy.stuff.581fa.html#|title='Family Guy' goes beyond TV with CD, movie|work=[[Press-Enterprise]]|author=Owen, Rob|authorlink=Rob Owen (journalist)|date=May 1, 2005|accessdate=October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also plays a significant part in ''[[Family Guy Video Game!]]'', the first ''Family Guy'' video game, which was released by [[Sierra Entertainment]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Family Guy' makes for simple-but-funny gaming|date=November 24, 2006|work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He (along with Stewie) features at the center of Family Guy's second video game, ''[[Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse]]''.

MacFarlane recorded exclusive material of Brian's voice and other ''Family Guy'' characters for a 2007 pinball machine of the show by [[Stern Pinball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Family Guy pinball is freakin' sweet|author=Finley, Adam|publisher=[[TV Squad]]|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/02/03/family-guy-pinball-is-freakin-sweet/#|date= February 3, 2007|accessdate= October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the first series of ''Family Guy'' toy figurines was released by [[Mezco Toyz]], each member of the Griffin family had their own toy, with the exception of Stewie, of whom two different figures were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Here's the Offbeat Stuff that true geeks are made of|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|author=Clodfelter, Tim|date=November 11, 2004|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of two years, four more series of toy figures have been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Szadkowski, Joseph|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date= June 3, 2006|title=Undead monster doomed to wander the high seas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daheshism''' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] الداهشية) is a spiritual message established by [[Dr. Dahesh]] (real name Salim Moussa Achi) in 1942:

On March 23, 1942, at the age of thirty three, Dr. Dahesh proclaimed in Beirut a spiritual message in which he called upon all people to embrace the ideals, the essence of their religions, not reducing their faith into external shows of pagan-like rituals and practices.  He declared his belief that humans—like all the other creatures on Earth—are subject to a cosmic law system. 

The just dispensations of this spiritual system apportion to humans their reincarnation on Earth, or in other worlds, according to their deserts. This cycle of reincarnation will come to an end only when they achieve spiritual transcendence by their own free will, integrating themselves into the spirit world. 

==Beliefs==
Proclaimed by Salim Moussa Achi ("Doctor Dahesh") on March 23, 1942, Daheshism is a spiritual doctrine whose tenets are built around the belief in a deeply mysterious, non-anthropomorphic, ever-present and watchful God. 
Daheshism teaches that all the major prophets (e.g., Abraham, Moses, David, Buddha, Jesus, and Mohammad) emanated from the same source known as The Christ. However — and as per a written directive by Doctor Dahesh — a Daheshist is obligated to respect other cultures' idea of God, to refrain from proselytizing, and never to engage in any sort of coercion. Daheshism believes in the intrinsic correlation between all the major religions: while Daheshism implies a “Unity of Religions,” it recognizes the necessity for those different religions. From a Daheshist perspective, a Christian, for example, need only become a better Christian. 

A Daheshist believes that all of creation is spread out over a multidimensional universe divided into three principal realms, each divided into 150 levels:

The utmost 150 levels make up the World of the Spirits, also known as The Divine Worlds. The highest, or purest of these Divine Worlds, are called The Heavens — the realm of God almighty. 

Daheshists believe that since no one can transgress certain limits — ever — the prospect of peering into the realm of God is therefore impossible. 

The realm of the Spirits comprises 150 levels; within these levels, dwell the Spirits. From these Spirits, extends a network of energy signatures known to the Daheshists as the Spiritual Fluids, in various degrees of loftiness, and depth, forming two subsequent realms known as Paradise, and Hell, each divided into 150 levels.

Spiritual Fluids are therefore the utmost-fundamental sentient energy building blocks, as well as the fabric and hidden consciousness of the realms of Paradise and Hell.

Daheshists believe in the existence of an equitable universal justice system that allows the Spiritual Fluids of all living — and non-living matter alike — to leave one plane of existence and reincarnate into another, according to their actions and tendencies. It is through these many cycles of reincarnation that Spiritual Fluids are given the opportunity to purify themselves in order to materialize in progressively better worlds, with the ultimate goal to become one with God. 

To a Daheshist, as sad and tragic as it may often feel, death is but a transition from one reality into another whose setting and circumstances that lie waiting are the direct consequences of one’s thoughts and actions. 
-------------------------------------------
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dahesh-portrait.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Portrait of Dr. Dahesh drawn by Marie Hadad]] --&gt;
Daheshism is summarized in the following five points:
*The existence and immortality of the spirit.
*Spiritual Fluids form the texture of the universe, and the substance of its creatures.
*Spiritual causality and just reward. (karma)
*Reincarnation.
*The essential unity of all religions.

Daheshists believe that Doctor Dahesh was, in part, a materialization of a Spiritual Fluid from THE CHRIST — the source of all the prophets, including Jesus Christ and Moses.

==Literature==
The Dahesh Heritage Center and The Daheshist Publishing Company, located on Broadway, New York, publish many books related to Dr. Dahesh's literature; Daheshism history; beliefs and news; and art-related literature as Dr. Dahesh was an avid art collector. His art collection is gathered in the [[Dahesh Museum of Art]] in New York.

The Daheshist Publishing Company also publishes the quarterly publication ''Dahesh Voice'' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] صوت داهش) in English and Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dahesh.pureconceptdesign.com/index.php/en/dahesh-voice.html Archives of ''Dahesh Voice'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17045">[[File:Varjayogini.jpg|right|thumb|Tibetan board carving of the ḍākinī [[Vajrayogini]].]]
{{Vajrayana}}
A '''ḍākinī''' ({{bo|t=མཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་|w=mkha' 'gro ma|s=Khandroma}}; {{lang-mn|хандарма}}; {{zh|c=空行母|p=Kōngxíng Mǔ}}; alternatively {{zh|c=荼枳尼|p=Túzhǐní}}) is a type of spirit in [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]]. The Sanskrit term is likely related to the term for drumming, while the Tibetan term means "skygoer" and may have originated in the Sanskrit ''khecara'', a term from the ''[[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra]]''.&lt;ref name=Buswell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jr.|first1=Robert E. Buswell|last2=Ziegler|first2=Donald S. Lopez Jr. ; with the assistance of Juhn Ahn, J. Wayne Bass, William Chu, Amanda Goodman, Hyoung Seok Ham, Seong-Uk Kim, Sumi Lee, Patrick Pranke, Andrew Quintman, Gareth Sparham, Maya Stiller, Harumi|title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691157863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dakinis are often represented as consorts in [[Yab-Yum]] representations. The masculine form of the word is ''{{IAST|ḍāka}}'', which is usually translated into Tibetan as ''[[pawo]]'' "hero" ({{bo|w=dpa' bo}}).&lt;ref name=Buswell /&gt;

The ḍākinī (and the ḍāka) appeared in medieval legends in India (such as in the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', ''[[Brahma Purana]]'', ''[[Markandeya Purana]]'' and ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'') as a demon in the train of [[Kali]] who feeds on human flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams, ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'' 1899&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a key tantric figure, the ḍākinī does appear in [[Tangmi]]; the ḍākinī figure disseminated into Japanese culture from [[Shingon Buddhism]], evolving into the ''dakini-ten'' ("ten" means "[[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]" in Japanese), becoming linked to the [[kitsune]] iconography.

The ḍākinī appears in a Vajrayana formulation of the [[Refuge (Buddhism)|Buddhist refuge formula]] known as the [[Three Roots]]. Most commonly she appears as the [[dharmapala]], alongside a [[guru]] and [[yidam]].

::The dakini, in her various guises, serves as each of the Three Roots. She may be a human guru, a [[vajra]] master who transmits the Vajrayana teachings to her disciples and joins them in [[samaya]] commitments. The wisdom dakini may be a [[yidam]], a meditational deity; female [[deity yoga]]s such as [[Vajrayogini]] are common in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Or she may be a protector; the wisdom dakinis have special power and responsibility to protect the integrity of oral transmissions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmer-Brown|first=Judith|title=Dakini's Warm Breath:The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism|publisher=Shambhala Publications Inc.|year=2002|isbn=978-1-57062-920-4|pages=139–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archetypal ḍākinī in Tibetan Buddhism is [[Yeshe Tsogyal]], consort of [[Padmasambhava]].&lt;ref name=Buswell /&gt;

==In Buddhism==

===In Tibetan Buddhism===
Although ḍākinī figures appear in [[Hinduism]] and [[Bon]], ḍākinīs occur most notably in [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]] and especially [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The khandroma, generally of volatile or wrathful temperament, acts somewhat as  spiritual [[muse]] for spiritual practice. Dakinis are energetic beings in female form, evocative of the movement of energy in space. In this context, the sky or space indicates [[śūnyatā]], the insubstantiality of all phenomena, which is, at the same time, the pure potentiality for all possible manifestations. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

====Classes of ḍākinī====
[[Judith Simmer-Brown]], based on teachings she received from Tibetan [[lama]]s,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Simmer-Brown|first=Judith|title=Dakini's Warm Breath:The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism|publisher=Shambhala Publications Inc.|location=Boston and London|year=2002|pages=69–79|isbn=978-1-57062-920-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt; identifies four main classes of ḍākinī. These follow the [[twilight language]] tradition of [[esoteric Buddhism]] in referring to secret, inner, outer and outer-outer classes of ḍākinīs.

# The secret class of ḍākinī is [[prajnaparamita]] (Tibetan ''yum chenmo''), the empty nature of reality according to [[Mahayana]] doctrine.
# The inner class of ḍākinī is the ḍākinī of the [[mandala]], a meditational deity (Tibetan:''yidam'') and fully enlightened Buddha who helps the practitioner recognise their own Buddhahood.
# The outer ḍākinī is the physical form of the ḍākinī, attained through [[completion stage]] tantra practices such as the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]] that work with the [[lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|subtle winds]] of the [[subtle body]] so that the practitioner's body is compatible with an [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] mind.
# The outer-outer ḍākinī is a ḍākinī in human form. She is a [[yogini]] in her own right but may also be a [[karmamudrā]], or consort, of a [[yogi]] or [[mahasiddha]].

Dakinis can also be classified according to the [[Trikaya]], or three bodies of [[buddhahood]].
# The [[Dharmakāya]] ḍākinī, which is [[Samantabhadrī (tutelary)|Samantabhadrī]], represents the [[dharmadhatu]] where all phenomena appear.
# The [[Sambhogakāya]] ḍākinīs are the [[yidam]]s used as meditational deities for tantric practice.
# The [[Nirmanakāya]] ḍākinīs are human women born with special potentialities; these are realized yoginis, consorts of gurus, or even all women in general as they may be classified into the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas|Five Buddha Families]].&lt;ref name="Capriles, Elías 2007"&gt;Cf.

====In Dzogchen====
[[File:Labit - Dâkinî - Minor Goddess - Tibet 19th century.jpg|thumb|Dancing ḍākinī, Tibet, c. 19th century]]
When considered as a stage on the Vajrayana Path, the ḍākinī is the final stages: the first is the guru, which corresponds to the initial realization of the true condition of reality, as this is introduced by the guru in the [[empowerment]], if the disciple obtains what the [[Inner Tantras]] call peyi yeshe ({{bo|w=dpe yi ye shes}}) or the clarity of shunyata. The second is the [[devata]], which corresponds to the [[meditation]] insofar as the devata is the method used for developing the state discovered in the initial realization of the true condition of reality. The third stage is the ḍākinī insofar as the ḍākinī is the source of the activities based on the realization of the guru and the meditation of the devata.

In [[Dzogchen]] these three correspond to tawa (''lta ba''), gompa (''sgom pa'') and chöpa (''spyod pa''): the first is the direct vision of the true nature of reality rather than an intellectual view of reality, as is the case with the term in other vehicles; the second is the continuity of this vision in sessions of meditation; and the third is the continuity of this vision in everyday activities. As a tantric practice, imperfections are utilised to make the vision uninterrupted. As the Base, the ḍākinīs are the energies of life; as the Path, they are the activities of advanced practitioners; as the Fruit, they are the actionless activities of realized Masters.&lt;ref name="Capriles, Elías 2007" /&gt;

====In Anuttarayoga Tantra====
Being associated with energy in all its functions, ḍākinīs are linked with the revelation of the [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]]s, which represent the path of transformation, whereby the energy of negative emotions or ''[[kleshas (Buddhism)|klesha]]s'', called poisons, is transformed into the luminous energy of enlightened awareness  yielding the most profound experience of [[osel (yoga)|clear light]]. [[Thubten Yeshe]] explains: &lt;blockquote&gt;When the [[completion stage]] practices have been mastered and we have gained control over our [[subtle energy]] winds and so forth, there will come a time when the dakas and dakinis will come... physically embracing such a consort is necessary to bring all the pervading energy winds into the central channel, a prerequisite for opening the [[heart chakra|heart center]] and experiencing the profoundest level of clear light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeshe|first=Lama|title=Introduction to Tantra: The Transformation of Desire|year=2001|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-162-8|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/?id=faidv-oW7P0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Daka====
In some instances, the terms ''ḍāka'' and ''ḍākinī'' have been used for practitioners of tantric yoga themselves. In other instances, just ''ḍākinī'' was used for female practitioners, while male practitioners were just known as ''yogi''. [[Padmasambhava]] was known as a yogi and [[Yeshe Tsogyal]], a Tibetan princess, yogini and consort of Padmasambhava, as a ḍākinī.

[[Miranda Shaw]], associate professor of religion at [[University of Richmond]], said in an interview in 1995, "In Sanskrit there is only one word, Dakini. There are only female Dakinis... there is no male Dakini. It is an impossibility and a contradiction in terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Powers|first=Tashi|title=Interview with Miranda Shaw|url=http://www.enlighteningtimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=70|publisher=Enlightening Times|accessdate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas [[Jan Willis]] in the chapter ''Ḑākinī; Some Comments on Its Nature and Meaning'' points out that "'she' is ''not'' 'female'. Though the ''ḍākinī'' assuredly most often appears in female form... this is but one of the ''myriad'' of ways Absolute Insight chooses to make manifest its facticity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willis|first=Janice D.|title=Feminine Ground: Essays on Women and Tibet|year=1995|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|isbn=9781559390521|pages=57–96|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KNhidgjO4RAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=feminine+ground#v=onepage&amp;q=feminine%20ground&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetan Lamas trained in the [[Gelug]] school, such as [[Sermey Khensur Lobsang Tharchin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tharchin|first=Sermey Khensur Lobsang|title=Sublime Path to kechara Paradise: Vajrayogini's Eleven Yogas of Generation Stage Practice|year=1997|publisher=Mahayana Sutra and Tantra Press|location=Howell, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-918753-13-7|pages=94|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JvUwAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=sublime+path+to+kechara}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Kelsang Gyatso]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gyatso|first=Kelsang|title=Guide to Dakini Land: The Highest Yoga Tantra practice of Buddha Vajrayogini|year=1999|publisher=Tharpa Publications|isbn=978-0948006-39-5|pages=188|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NHAj4NV-3i8C&amp;dq=guide+to+Dakini+Land}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those of the [[Karma Kagyu]] school such as [[Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karthar Rinpoche|first=Khenpo|title=Karma Chakme's Mountain Dharma, Vol 2|year=2006|publisher=KTD Publications|isbn=978-0-9741092-1-3|pages=289|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OksX-pfDF4wC&amp;dq=chakme+vol+2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  write freely of "dakas and dakinis". [[Thubten Yeshe]] clarifies their meaning: "what are dakas and dakinis? Simply speaking they are males and females who possess advanced experiences of tantric transformation and control and are therefore able to increase the blissful wisdom of a highly qualified practitioner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeshe|first=Lama|title=Introduction to Tantra: The Transformation of Desire|year=1999|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-162-8|pages=135|url=https://books.google.com/?id=faidv-oW7P0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Japanese Buddhism===
[[File:Dakini.png|thumb|upright|Dakini-ten in Japan&lt;br /&gt;She always appears in the form of riding on a white fox. 1783]]
Although the ḍākinī imagery appears to have come to Japan via [[Kūkai]]'s introduction of [[Tangmi]] in [[Shingon Buddhism]] in the early 9th century; her form appears more like the ḍākinīs of Hindu iconography than those found in Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boscaro|first=Adriana|title=Rethinking Japan: Social Sciences, Ideology and Thought |year=2003 |publisher=Curzon Press |isbn=978-0-904404-79-1 |pages=330 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kO0tUpCViA8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the decline of the [[Heian period]], the ḍākinī image was mixed together with images of foxes and half-naked women, acquiring the names {{nihongo|''Dakini-ten''|荼枳尼天||Dakini-[[deity]]}}, {{nihongo|''Shinkoō-bosatsu''|辰狐王菩薩||Star Fox Queen-[[Bodhisattva]]}}, and {{nihongo|''Kiko-tennō''|貴狐天王||Noble Fox-Heavenly Queen}}. In the Middle Ages, the [[Emperor of Japan]] would chant before an image of the fox Dakini-ten during his [[Enthronement of the Japanese Emperor|Enthronement]], and both the ''[[shōgun]]'' and the emperor would venerate Dakini-ten whenever they saw it, as it was a common belief at the time that ceasing to pay respects to Dakini-ten would cause the immediate ruin of the regime.

Although Dakini-ten was said to be a powerful Buddhist deity, the images and stories surrounding it in Japan in both medieval and modern times are drawn from local ''[[kitsune]]'' mythology. The modern folk belief, often printed in Japanese books about religion, is that the fox image was a substitute for the Indian jackal, but the jackal is not associated with Dakini anywhere. As another example of the connection between Dakini-ten and the government of Japan, in the ''[[Genpei Jōsuiki]]'' it is claimed that [[Taira no Kiyomori]] met a ''kitsune'' on the road and that his subsequent performance of Dakini-ten rites caused him to rise from an unimportant clan leader to the ruler of the entire nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smyers|first=Karen Ann|authorlink=Karen Ann Smyers|title=The fox and the jewel: shared and private meanings in contemporary Japanese inari worship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cavXAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2058-9|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[early modern period]], the ḍākinī rite devolved into various spells called Dakini-ten, [[Atago Gongen]]. Those who felt wronged in their village could go to a corrupt [[yamabushi]] who practiced black magic, and get him to trap a ''kitsune'' and cause it to possess a third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blacker|first=Carmen|title=TheCatalpa Bow: A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-203-34713-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x00iI9ApEQYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reports of possession became especially common in the [[Edo]] and [[Meiji period|Meiji]] periods.

Although it literally means to become divine, or to become a god, most Christian denominations do not interpret the doctrine as implying an overcoming of a fundamental metaphysical difference between God and humanity, for example [[John of the Cross]] had it: "it is true that its natural being, though thus transformed, is as distinct from the Being of God as it was before".&lt;ref group=Primary&gt;{{citation|chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/john_cross/ascent.v.v.html|author=St. John of the Cross, OCD|authorlink=John of the Cross|title=The Ascent of Mount Carmel |chapter=Book 2, Chapter 5, Section 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = BON/&gt;

== Patristic writings ==
The term originally was used in Greco-Roman pagan society to venerate a ruler. It was inconceivable to [[Judaism|Jewish piety]]. Yet, with a time, it was adopted in Eastern Christianity by the [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]] to describe spiritual transformation of a Christian. The change of human nature was understood by them as a consequence of a [[Baptism|baptized person]] being incorporated into the [[Ecclesiology|Church as the Body of Christ]]. Divinization was thus developed within the context of [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational theology]]. The teaching about deification of a Christian can be found as early as in the works of [[Irenaeus]], a Greek Father who was a head of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lyon|church of Lyons]] (c. 130–202) e.g. in the preface to his ''[[Adversus Haereses]]'' vol. 5. [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] was an author of the phrase about [[Jesus Christ]] which has become popular in [[Christmas]] [[homilies]]: "He was made human so that he might make us gods" (''De incarnatione'' 54,3, cf. ''Contra Arianos'' 1.39). Divinization in the context of the [[Eucharist]] was taught by [[Gregory of Nyssa]] and [[Cyril of Alexandria]]. The term never meant for them breaching the absolute ontological distinction between God and his creation.&lt;ref name = BON&gt;{{Cite book | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GcVhAGpvTQ0C&amp;pg=PA265&amp;lpg=PA266&amp;dq=Deification,+Divinization+Geral+Bonner+Augustine+through+the+Ages&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j8rpD6YBdw&amp;sig=kBKOaBYzkENHFnlPcQ6aoqUd5Yo&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxxLOB44_cAhUGKewKHRg7C9cQ6AEIRDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Deification%2C%20Divinization%20Geral%20Bonner%20Augustine%20through%20the%20Ages&amp;f=false| chapter = Deification, Divinization | first = Gerald | last = Bonner | title = Augustine through the Ages.

There were many different references to divinization in the writings of the [[Church Fathers]].

In the second century, [[Irenaeus]], bishop of Lyons (c. 130–202) said that God had "become what we are, that He might bring us to be even what He is Himself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103500.htm ''Adversus haereses'', book 5, preface] - ''Factus est quod sumus nos, uti nos perficeret quod et ipse''.&lt;/ref&gt; He added:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Do we cast blame on him [God] because we were not made gods from the beginning, but were at first created merely as men, and then later as gods? Although God has adopted this course out of his pure benevolence, that no one may charge him with discrimination or stinginess, he declares, "I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are sons of the Most High." ... For it was necessary at first that nature be exhibited, then after that what was mortal would be conquered and swallowed up in immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'' 4.38 (4); compare 4.11 (2): "But man receives progression and increase towards God. For as God is always the same, so also man, when found in God, shall always progress towards God."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At about the same time, [[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150–215), wrote: "Yea, I say, the Word of God became a man so that you might learn from a man how to become a god."&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, Exhortation to the Greeks, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Clement further stated that "[i]f one knows himself, he will know God, and knowing God will become like God. . . . His is beauty, true beauty, for it is God, and that man becomes a god, since God wills it. So Heraclitus was right when he said, 'Men are gods, and gods are men.'"&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, The Instructor, 3.1. See his Stromateis, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Clement of Alexandria also stated that "he who obeys the Lord and follows the prophecy given through him ... becomes a god while still moving about in the flesh."&lt;ref&gt;Stromata {{formatnum:716101}},4 (Ed. Stählin): ὁ τῷ κυρίῳ πειθόμενος καὶ τῇ δοθείσῃ δι' αὐτοῦ κατακολουθήσας προφητείᾳ τελέως ἐκτελεῖται κατ' εἰκόνα τοῦ διδασκάλου ἐν σαρκὶ περιπολῶν θεός&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin Martyr]] c. 100–165) insisted that in the beginning men "were made like God, free from suffering and death," and that they are thus "deemed worthy of becoming gods and of having power to become sons of the highest."&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho, 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria]] (c. 296–373), stated his belief in literal deification: "The Word was made flesh in order that we might be made gods. ... Just as the Lord, putting on the body, became a man, so also we men are both deified through his flesh, and henceforth inherit everlasting life."&lt;ref&gt;Athanasius, Against the Arians, 1.39, 3.34.&lt;/ref&gt; Athanasius also observed: "For the Son of God became man so that we might become God."&lt;ref&gt;St. Athanasius, De inc. 54, 3: PG 25, 192B&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Αὐτὸς γὰρ ἐνηνθρώπισεν, ἵνα ἡμεῖς θεοποιηθῶμεν ([https://books.google.com/books?id=_A0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Migne, ''Patrologia Graeca'', 25, 192 B  De incarnatione Verbi, 54]: literally, "... that ''we'' might become ...". Grammatically, the verb θεοποιηθῶμεν could be translated as "be made God" Himself or "be made gods."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430) said: "But he himself that justifies also deifies, for by justifying he makes sons of God. 'For he has given them power to become the sons of God' [referring to John 1:12]. If then we have been made sons of god, we have also been made gods."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, On the Psalms, 50.2. Augustine insists that such individuals are gods by grace rather than by nature, but they are "called gods" nevertheless.&lt;/ref&gt; "To make human beings gods," Augustine said, "He was made man who was God" (sermon 192.1.1). Augustine goes on to write that "[they] are not born of His Substance, that they should be the same as He, but that by favour they should come to Him... (Ibid)".

==Biblical citations==
{{reflist|group=Bible}}

* [[Paul the Apostle]] taught in numerous passages that men are sons of God (as in chapter 8 of Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]]). Paul conceives of the resurrection as immortalization of both the body and the soul (1 Cor 15:42-49). {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|3:17-18}} says that "we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another."
* In {{bibleverse||John|10:34}}, Jesus defends himself against a charge of blasphemy by stating: "Have I not said that ye are gods?" It is widely believed that Jesus is referring to {{bibleverse||Psalms|82:6}} in saying "Ye are gods and children of the most high."
* Christ's defence against the charge of blasphemy includes the following passages from {{bibleref2|John|10:33–36|KJV}}
{{quote|The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?}}
* In ({{bibleverse|1|John|5:4—5}};{{bibleverse||Revelation|2:7-11}}), the apostle, John the Beloved, speaks about how men can overcome the world, as Christ did, through Christ's sacrifice.
* There are several Bible verses&lt;ref&gt;({{bibleverse||Romans|8:17}};{{bibleverse||Galatians|4:7}};{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:21-23}};{{bibleverse||Revelation|21:7}})&lt;/ref&gt; which, if summarized state that, through Christ, men may become "heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ" and "will inherit all things" just as Christ inherits all things.

== Eastern Orthodox ==

{{main article|Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)}}
{{See also|Glorification}}
The teaching of deification or ''theosis'' in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] refers to the attainment of ''likeness of God'',  ''union with God'' or ''reconciliation with God''. Deification has three stages in its process of transformation: ''katharsis'', ''theoria'', ''theosis''. ''Theosis'' as such is the goal, it is the purpose of life, and it is considered achievable only through a synergy (or cooperation) between humans' activities and God's uncreated energies (or operations).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|George|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bartos|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Theosis'' is an important concept in Eastern Orthodox theology deriving from the fact that Eastern Orthodox theology is of an explicitly mystical character. Theology in the Eastern Orthodox Church is what is derived from saints or mystics of the tradition, and Eastern Orthodoxy considers that "''no one who does not follow the path of union with God can be a theologian.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lossky|2002|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Eastern Orthodoxy, theology is not treated as an academic pursuit, but it is based on revelation (see [[gnosiology]]), meaning that Eastern Orthodox theology and its theologians are validated by ascetic pursuits, rather than academic degrees (i.e. [[scholasticism]]).

According to the ''Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'', as quoted by Millet and Reynolds:

{{Quote|Deification (Greek theosis) is for Orthodoxy the goal of every Christian. Man, according to the Bible, is 'made in the image and likeness of God.' ... It is possible for man to become like God, to become deified, to become god by grace. This doctrine is based on many passages of both OT and NT (e.g. Ps. 82 (81).6; II Peter 1.4), and it is essentially the teaching both of St Paul, though he tends to use the language of filial adoption (cf. Rom. 8.9—17; Gal. 4.5—7), and the Fourth Gospel (cf. 17.21—23).}}

{{Quote|The language of II Peter is taken up by St Irenaeus, in his famous phrase, 'if the Word has been made man, it is so that men may be made gods' (Adv. Haer V, Pref.), and becomes the standard in Greek theology. In the fourth century, St. Athanasius repeats Irenaeus almost word for word, and in the fifth century St Cyril of Alexandria says that we shall become sons 'by participation' (Greek methexis). Deification is the central idea in the spirituality of St. Maximus the Confessor, for whom the doctrine is the corollary of the Incarnation: 'Deification, briefly, is the encompassing and fulfillment of all times and ages,' ... and St. Symeon the New Theologian at the end of the tenth century writes, 'He who is God by nature converses with those whom he has made gods by grace, as a friend converses with his friends, face to face.' ...&lt;ref name="Millet and Reynolds 1998"/&gt;}}

=== Vision of God ===

According to Hierotheos Vlachos, divinization, also called ''theosis'', "is the participation in the Uncreated grace of God" and "is identified and connected with the ''[[theoria]]'' (vision) of the Uncreated Light". "''Theoria'' is the vision of the glory of God. ''Theoria'' is identified with the vision of the uncreated Light, the uncreated energy of God, with the union of man with God, with man's ''theosis''. This vision, by which faith is attained, is what saves: "Faith comes by hearing the Word and by experiencing ''theoria'' (the vision of God). We accept faith at first by hearing in order to be healed, and then we attain to faith by ''theoria'', which saves man." It is also one of the means by which Christians came to know the [[Trinity]]: "The disciples of Christ acquired the knowledge of the Triune God in ''theoria'' (vision of God) and by revelation."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vlachos|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As a patristic and historical teaching ===

For many [[Church Fathers]], ''theosis'' goes beyond simply restoring people to their state before the Fall of Adam and Eve, teaching that because Christ united the human and divine natures in Jesus' person, it is now possible for someone to experience closer fellowship with God than Adam and Eve initially experienced in the Garden of Eden, and that people can become more like God than Adam and Eve were at that time. Some Eastern Orthodox theologians go so far as to say that Jesus would have become [[Incarnation|incarnate]] for this reason alone, even if Adam and Eve had never sinned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lossky|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ascetic practice ===

{{See also|Desert Fathers|Maximus the Confessor|Monasticism}}

The journey toward theosis includes many forms of [[praxis (Orthodox)|praxis]]. The most obvious form being Monasticism and Clergy. Of the Monastic tradition the practice of [[hesychasm]] is most important as a way to establish a direct relationship with God. Living in the community of the church and partaking regularly of the sacraments, and especially the [[Eucharist]], is taken for granted. Also important is cultivating "[[prayer of the heart]]", and prayer that never ceases, as Paul exhorts the Thessalonians ([[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1]] and [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians|2]]). This unceasing prayer of the heart is a dominant theme in the writings of the Fathers, especially in those collected in the [[Philokalia]]. It is considered that no one can reach theosis without an impeccable Christian living, crowned by faithful, warm, and, ultimately, silent ([[hesychasm|hesychast]]), continuous Prayer of the Heart. The "doer" in deification is the Holy Spirit, with whom the human being joins his will to receive this transforming grace by praxis and prayer, and as Saint [[Gregory Palamas]] teaches, the Christian mystics are deified as they become filled with the [[Light of Tabor]] of the Holy Spirit in the degree that they make themselves open to it by asceticism (divinization being not a one-sided act of God, but a loving cooperation between God and the advanced Christian, which Palamas considers a synergy).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maloney|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Synergism (theology)|synergy]] or co-operation between God and Man does not lead to mankind being absorbed into the God as was taught in earlier pagan forms of deification like [[Henosis]]. Rather it expresses unity, in the complementary nature between the created and the creator. Acquisition of the Holy Spirit is key as the acquisition of the spirit leads to [[self-realization]].

==Western Christianity==

=== Catholic theology (including Latin and Eastern Churches) ===
{{Christian mysticism}}
The term ''divinization'' is characteristic of Eastern Christian thought. Western Christianity, at least since [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430) named as the ''doctor of grace'', has always preferred to speak about supernatural grace transforming a Christian according to the Image of Christ. One cannot say, though, that the action of God on human nature conveyed in the term ''divinization'' (''theosis'') is alien to the Roman Catholic teaching, as is evident in Augustine repeating the famous phrase of [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]: "To make human beings gods, he was made man, who was God" (''Deos facturus qui homines erant, homo factus est qui Deus erat'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://www.augustinus.it/latino/discorsi/discorso_245_testo.htm] | title = Sermo 192,1 — 'In natali Domini'|  |website= augustinus.it |access-date= 2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref name = BON/&gt;. It is evident from what the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' says of Christians as partakers of the divine nature:

{{Quote|The Word became flesh to make us "partakers of the divine nature": "For this is why the Word became man, and the Son of God became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son of God." "For the Son of God became man so that we might become God." "The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods."&lt;ref group=Primary&gt;{{citation|title=''Catechism of the Catholic Church''|year=1995|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=0385479670|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM#-H1|author=Catholic Church|authorlink=Catholic Church|chapter=Article 460|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Arguably the most prolific of the [[medieval]] [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] theologians, [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], wrote:
{{quote|Now the gift of grace surpasses every capability of created nature, since it is nothing short of a partaking of the Divine Nature, which exceeds every other nature. And thus it is impossible that any creature should cause grace. For it is as necessary that God alone should deify, bestowing a partaking of the Divine Nature by a participated likeness, as it is impossible that anything save fire should enkindle.&lt;ref group=Primary&gt;{{citation|chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FS_Q112_A1.html|author=St. Thomas Aquinas, OP|authorlink=Thomas Aquinas|title=Summa Theologiae |chapter=First Part of the Second Part, Question 112, Article 1, Response}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He also wrote of God's "special love, whereby He draws the rational creature above the condition of its nature to a participation of the Divine good".&lt;ref group=Primary&gt;{{citation|chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FS_Q110_A1.html|author=St. Thomas Aquinas, OP|authorlink=Thomas Aquinas|title=Summa Theologiae |chapter=First Part of the Second Part, Question 110, Article 1, Response}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he ultimately roots the purpose of the [[Incarnation]] in theosis.&lt;ref group=Primary&gt;{{citation|chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.TP_Q1_A2.html|author=St. Thomas Aquinas, OP|authorlink=Thomas Aquinas|title=Summa Theologiae |chapter=Third Part, Question 1, Article 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note, however, that the divinization taught by Aquinas, Augustine, and other Western Fathers is not ontological, but rather analogical, meaning that souls do not take on the substance of God, but rather through grace, are gifted with the participation in the Divine Life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G-grAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA344&amp;dq=communicable%20attributes%20of%20god%20pohle%20preuss&amp;pg=PA340#v=onepage&amp;q=communicable%20attributes%20of%20god%20pohle%20preuss&amp;f=false|title=Grace, Actual and Habitual: A Dogmatic Treatise|last=Pohle|first=Joseph|last2=Preuss|first2=Arthur|date=1917|publisher=B.

Of a more modern Roman Catholic theologian it has been said: "The theological vision of [[Karl Rahner]], the German Jesuit whose thought has been so influential in the Roman Catholic Church and beyond over the last fifty years, has at its very core the symbol of ''theopoiesis''. The process of divinization is the center of gravity around which move Rahner's understanding of creation, anthropology, Christology, ecclesiology, liturgy, and eschatology. The importance of this process for Rahner is such that we are justified in describing his overall theological project to be largely a matter of giving a coherent and contemporary account of divinization."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christensen|Wittung|2007|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua Bloor in his article reveals the rise in deification from an array of Western traditions, looking closely at the Catholic Theologian Catherine LaCugna, arguing that LaCugna sees deification as "personal communion with God, which deifies the human in the process, conforming him/her into being Christ-like"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloor|first1=J. D. A.|title=New Directions in Western Soteriology|journal=Theology|date=21 April 2015|volume=118|issue=3|pages=179–187|doi=10.1177/0040571X14564932}} See p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Rite]] liturgy expresses the doctrine of divinization or ''theosis'' in the prayer said by the deacon or priest when preparing the Eucharistic chalice: "Per huius aquae et vini mysterium eius efficiamur divinitatis consortes, qui humanitatis nostrae fieri dignatus est particeps" ("By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity.")&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|1990|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=614}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plater|1992|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church teaches that God gives to some souls, even in the present life, a very special grace by which they can be mystically united to God even while yet alive: this is true mystical contemplation.&lt;ref name="oce.catholic"&gt;{{harvnb|Sauvage|1913|p=663}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen as the culmination of the three states, or stages, of perfection through which the soul passes: the [[purgative way]] (that of cleansing or purification, the Greek term for which is κάθαρσις, ''katharsis''), the [[illuminative way]] (so called because in it the mind becomes more and more enlightened as to spiritual things and the practice of virtue, corresponding to what in Greek is called Θεωρία, ''theoria''), and the [[unitive way]] (that of union with God by love and the actual experience and exercise of that love, a union that is called θέωσις, ''theosis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devine|1913|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writings attributed to [[St. Dionysius the Areopagite]] were highly influential in the West, and their theses and arguments were adopted by [[Peter Lombard]], [[Alexander of Hales]], [[Albert the Great]], [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] and [[St. Bonaventure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stiglmayr|1913|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these writings, mystical knowledge must be distinguished from the rational knowledge by which we know God, not in his nature, but through the wonderful order of the universe, which is a participation of the divine ideas. Through the more perfect knowledge of God that is mystical knowledge, a knowledge beyond the attainments of reason even enlightened by faith, the soul contemplates directly the mysteries of divine light. In the present life this contemplation is possible only to a few privileged souls, through a very special grace of God: it is the θέωσις (theosis), μυστικὴ ἕνωσις (mystical union).&lt;ref name="oce.catholic" /&gt; [[Meister Eckhart]] too taught a deification of man and an assimilation of the creature into the Creator through contemplation.&lt;ref name="oce.catholic" /&gt;

Deification, to which, in spite of its presence in the liturgical prayers of the West, Western theologians have given less attention than Eastern, is nevertheless prominent in the writing of Western mystics.&lt;ref name="Deification1997" /&gt;

[[St. Catherine of Siena]] had God say: "They are like the burning coal that no one can put out once it is completely consumed in the furnace, because it has itself been turned into fire. So it is with these souls cast into the furnace of my charity, who keep nothing at all, not a bit of their own will, outside of me but are completely set afire in me. There is no one who can seize them or drag them out of my grace. They have been made one with me and I with them."&lt;ref group=Primary&gt;{{citation|title=The Dialogue|year=1980|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0809122332|author=Catherine of Siena|authorlink=Catherine of Siena|page=147|others=Suzanne Noffke, trans.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. John of the Cross]], OCD wrote: "In thus allowing God to work in it, the soul ... is at once illumined and transformed in God, and God communicates to it His supernatural Being, in such wise that it appears to be God Himself, and has all that God Himself has. And this union comes to pass when God grants the soul this supernatural favour, that all the things of God and the soul are one in participant transformation; and the soul seems to be God rather than a soul, and is indeed God by participation; although it is true that its natural being, though thus transformed, is as distinct from the Being of God as it was before."&lt;ref group=Primary&gt;{{citation|chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/john_cross/ascent.v.v.html|author=St. John of the Cross, OCD|authorlink=John of the Cross|title=The Ascent of Mount Carmel |chapter=Book 2, Chapter 5, Section 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orestes Brownson]] wrote: "The principle of the order founded by the incarnation of the Word is the deification of the creature, to make the creature one with the Creator, so that the creature may participate in the divine life, which is love, and in the divine blessedness, the eternal and infinite blessedness of the holy and ineffable Trinity, the one ever-living God. Creation itself has no other purpose or end; and the incarnation of the Word, and the whole Christian order, are designed by the divine economy simply as the means to this end, which is indeed realized or consummated in Christ the Lord, at once perfect God and perfect man, indissolubly united in one divine person. The design of the Christian order is, through regeneration by the Holy Ghost, to unite every individual man to Christ, and to make all believers one with one another, and one with him, as he and the Father are one. All who are thus regenerated and united, are united to God, made one with him, live in his life, and participate in his infinite, eternal, and ineffable bliss or blessedness."&lt;ref group=Primary&gt;{{citation|title=Our Lady of Lordes|year=1875|author=Orestes Brownson|authorlink=Orestes Brownson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anglican theology ===

Out of the [[English Reformation]], an understanding of salvation in terms closely comparable to the Orthodox doctrine of theosis was recognized in the Anglican tradition, J. Bloor examines deification/theosis in the late Anglican Priest and theologian Canon A. M. (Donald) Allchin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloor|first1=J. D. A.|title=New Directions in Western Soteriology|journal=Theology|date=21 April 2015|volume=118|issue=3|pages=179–187|doi=10.1177/0040571X14564932}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also explored in the writings of [[Lancelot Andrewes]], who described salvation in terms vividly reminiscent of the early fathers:

{{quote|Whereby, as before He of ours, so now we of His are made partakers. He clothed with our flesh, and we invested with His Spirit. The great promise of the Old Testament accomplished, that He should partake our human nature; and the great and precious promise of the New, that we should be ''"consortes divinae naturae"'', ''"partake his divine nature,"'' both are this day accomplished.&lt;ref group=Primary&gt;{{citation|last=Lancelot|first=Andrewes|title=Ninety-Six Sermons|year=1843|publisher=J H Parker|location=Oxford|oclc=907983|authorlink=Lancelot Andrewes|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[C.S. Lewis]], speaking on his personal belief in the subject of literal deification, stated as follows:

{{Quote|It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses'', rev. ed. (New York: Macmillan, Collier Books, 1980), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a more complete statement on his beliefs in literal deification, C.S. Lewis stated in his book, "Mere Christianity" as follows:

{{Quote|The command Be ye perfect is not idealistic gas. Nor is it a command to do the impossible. He is going to make us into creatures that can obey that command. He said (in the Bible) that we were "gods" and He is going to make good His words. If we let Him—for we can prevent Him, if we choose—He will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a god or goddess, dazzling, radiant, immortal creature, pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine, a bright stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly (though, of course, on a smaller scale) His own boundless power and delight and goodness. The process will be long and in parts very painful; but that is what we are in for. Nothing less. He meant what He said.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Mere Christianity, 174—75.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Protestant theology ===

Theosis is not emphasized in Protestant theology except among Quakers who believed that they experienced celestial inhabitation and Methodists/Wesleyans, whose religious tradition has always placed strong emphasis on [[entire sanctification]], and whose doctrine of sanctification has many similarities with the Catholic/Eastern Orthodox concept of theosis or divinization.

Early during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], thought was given to the doctrine of [[union with Christ]] (''unio cum Christo'') as the precursor to the entire process of salvation and [[sanctification]]. This was especially so in the thought of [[John Calvin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tan|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Scougal]]'s work ''The Life of God in the Soul of Man'' is sometimes cited as important in keeping alive among Protestants the ideas central to the doctrine. In the introductory passages of his book, Scougal describes "religion" in terms that evoke the doctrine of theosis:

{{quote|... a resemblance of the divine perfections, the image of the Almighty shining in the soul of man: ... a real participation of his nature, it is a beam of the eternal light, a drop of that infinite ocean of goodness; and they who are endued with it, may be said to have 'God dwelling in their souls', and 'Christ formed within them'." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scougal|1868|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Based on their spiritual experiences and tested against the testimony of scripture, George Fox and early Quakers believed that celestial inhabitation was a normal experience within the early church where individuals and communities were led by the living presence of Christ dwelling within them. George Fox wrote:

"The scriptures saith God will dwell in men, and walk in men … Doth not the Apostle say, the saints were partakers of the divine nature? And that God dwells in the saints, and Christ is in them, except they be reprobates? And do not the saints come to eat the flesh of Christ? And if they eat his flesh, is it not within them?"&lt;ref&gt;George Fox – Great Mystery of the Great Whore in the Works of George Fox, volume 3, pp.181-82&lt;/ref&gt;

''Theosis'' as a doctrine developed in a distinctive direction among [[Methodist]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Wild Things of God|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere in the [[pietism|pietist]] movement which reawakened Protestant interest in the [[asceticism]] of the early Catholic Church, and some of the [[mystical]] traditions of the West. Distinctively, in Wesleyan [[Protestantism]] theosis sometimes implies the doctrine of ''entire sanctification'' which teaches, in summary, that it is the Christian's goal, in principle possible to achieve, to live without any (voluntary) [[sin]] (''[[Christian perfection]]''). In 1311 the Roman Catholic [[Council of Vienne]] declared this notion, "that man in this present life can acquire so great and such a degree of perfection that he will be rendered inwardly sinless, and that he will not be able to advance farther in grace" (Denziger §471), to be a [[heresy]]. Thus this particular Protestant (primarily Methodist) understanding of theosis is substantially different from that of the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, or Anglican Churches. This doctrine of [[Christian perfection]] was sharply criticized by many in the [[Church of England]] during the ministry of [[John Wesley]] and continues to be controversial among Protestants and Anglicans to this day.&lt;ref group=Primary&gt;{{citation|last=Wesley|first=John|title=Plain Account of Christian Perfection|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wesley/perfection.toc.html|authorlink=John Wesley|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the Finnish school of Lutheran thought has drawn close associations between theosis and justification. Primarily spearheaded by [[Tuomo Mannermaa]], this line of theological development grew out of talks between the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and the Russian Orthodox Church between 1970 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marquart|2000|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mannermaa argues in his book, ''Christ Present in Faith'', that the real exchange between Christ and sinful humanity, a theme prevalent in Luther's writing, is synonymous with Eastern views of theosis. It is in this real exchange which Mannermaa says "the union between Christ and the believer makes the latter a ‘completely divine [person] {{sic}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mannermaa|2005|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this departure from traditional Lutheran thought is sometimes hailed as "the threshold of a third Luther Renaissance,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marquart|2000|p=183}}, quoting Dr. Ulrich Asendorf&lt;/ref&gt; other Lutheran scholars disagree and argue that the idea of theosis violates Luther's theology of the cross principles by ignoring the real distinction that is axiomatic for not only Luther, but for orthodox Christianity as a whole. One of the most prominent scholars is Robert Kolb, who primarily roots this critique in Luther's use of marriage metaphors concerning the Christian's relationship with God. Kolb writes "This view ignores the nature of the ‘union’ of bride and bridegroom that Luther employed so far."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kolb|2009|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evangelical scholarship has yielded yet another view of theosis. Patristic scholar Donald Fairbairn has argued that theosis in the Greek Fathers is not an [[ontological]] exchange between the Son and the Christian. In general Fairbairn argues that the change that occurs in theosis is "something more than mere status but less than the possession of God's very substance."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fairbairn|2003|pp=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Life in the Trinity'', he argues that through our relationship with the Son we are brought into the same kind of relationship with the Father (and Spirit) that the Son has. He supports this argument by identifying a distinction between the Son's warm-fellowship with the Father, and his ontological union with the Father. He argues that the Greek Fathers, primarily [[Athanasius]] and [[Cyril of Alexandria]] were clear that we never share ontological union with God, but only this intimate fellowship.

{{quote|Like Athanasius, but with much more precision, Cyril distinguishes two kinds of unity between the Father and the Son. The first is a unity of substance, and the Father and the Son do not share this kind of unity with us in any way whatsoever. The second, though, is a unity of love or fellowship that the father and the Son have enjoyed from all eternity precisely because of their unity of substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fairbairn|2009|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Christian universalist theology ===
{{main article|Christian Universalism|Universal reconciliation}}
There has been a modern revival of the concept of theosis (often called "manifest sonship" or "Christedness") among Christians who hold to the doctrine of [[universal reconciliation]] or ''[[apocatastasis]]'', especially those with a background in the [[charismatic movement|charismatic]] [[Latter Rain (post–World War II movement)|Latter Rain Movement]] or even the [[New Age]] and [[New Thought]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stetson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement of faith of the Christian Universalist Association includes theosis in one of its points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Christian Universalist Association|2012a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Christian Universalist Association|2012b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority of charismatic Christian universalists believe that the "[[return of Christ]]" is a corporate body of perfected human beings who are the "Manifested Sons of God" instead of a literal return of the person of Jesus, and that these Sons will reign on the earth and transform all other human beings from sin to perfection during an age that is coming soon (a particularly "universalistic" approach to [[millennialism]]). Some [[liberal Christianity|liberal Christian]] universalists with New Age leanings share a similar [[eschatology]].

=== Western views on hesychasm ===

The practice of ascetic prayer called [[hesychasm]] in the Eastern Orthodox Church is centered on the enlightenment or deification, theosis of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chrysostomos|2001|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Constantinople experienced a succession of councils alternately approving and condemning doctrine concerning hesychasm, the Western Church held no council in which to make a pronouncement on the issue, and the word "hesychasm" does not appear in the [[Denzinger|''Enchiridion Symbolorum et Definitionum'' (Handbook of Creeds and Definitions)]], the collection of Roman Catholic teachings originally compiled by [[Heinrich Joseph Dominicus Denzinger]].

Despite the fact that the hesychast doctrine of [[Gregory Palamas]] has never been officially condemned by the Catholic Church, Western theologians tended to reject it, often equating it with [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|quietism]]. This identification may have been motivated in part by the fact that "quietism" is the literal translation of "hesychasm". However, according to Kallistos Ware, "To translate 'hesychasm' as 'quietism', while perhaps etymologically defensible, is historically and theologically misleading." Ware asserts that "the distinctive tenets of the seventeenth century Western Quietists are not characteristic of Greek hesychasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Spirituality |first=Gordon S. |last=Wakefield |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=1983 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ga815P6vxygC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=hesychasm+quietism#v=onepage&amp;q=hesychasm%20quietism&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-664-22170-6}}, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere too, Ware argues that it is important not to translate "hesychasm" as "quietism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The inner kingdom |first=Kallistos |last=Ware |publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=2000 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g8qaOmtq6xoC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=hesychasm+quietism#v=onepage&amp;q=hesychasm%20quietism&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-88141-209-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paths to the heart: Sufism and the Christian East |first=James S. |last=Cutsinger |publisher=World Wisdom, Inc |year=2002 |page=261 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6wcEQdkvt3EC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=hesychasm+quietism#v=onepage&amp;q=hesychasm%20quietism&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-941532-43-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For long, Palamism won almost no following in the West,.&lt;ref name="fortescue301"&gt;{{harvnb|Fortescue|1913|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the distrustful attitude of [[Barlaam of Seminara|Barlaam]] in its regard prevailed among Western theologians, surviving into the early 20th century, as shown in [[Adrian Fortescue]]'s article on hesychasm in the 1910 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].&lt;ref name="fortescue301"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreopoulos|2005|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, Siméon Vailhé described some aspects of the teaching of Palamas as "monstrous errors", "heresies" and "a resurrection of polytheism", and called the hesychast method for arriving at perfect [[theoria|contemplation]] "no more than a crude form of [[auto-suggestion]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vailhé|1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century saw a remarkable change in the attitude of Roman Catholic theologians to Palamas, a "rehabilitation" of him that has led to increasing parts of the Western Church considering him a saint, even if uncanonized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8jcjtUbwptwC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Palamas+Meyendorff+Nicene+doctrine&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4iQXTf_BE4SWhQfI5qi3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false John Meyendorff (editor),''Gregory Palamas - The Triads'', p. xi]&lt;/ref&gt; John Meyendorff describes the 20th-century rehabilitation of Palamas in the Western Church as a "remarkable event in the history of scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gregory Palamas |author=Saint Gregory Palamas |publisher=Paulist Press |year=1983|page=xi |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8jcjtUbwptwC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Palamas+Meyendorff+Nicene+doctrine#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-8091-2447-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andreas Andreopoulos cites the 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia article by Fortescue as an example of how Barlaam's distrustful and hostile attitude regarding hesychasm survived until recently in the West, adding that now "the Western world has started to rediscover what amounts to a lost tradition.

Jeffrey D. Finch claims that "the future of East-West rapprochement appears to be overcoming the modern polemics of neo-scholasticism and neo-Palamism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgtUoMqm594C&amp;pg=PA244 |editor-first1=Michael J. |editor-last1=Christensen |editor-first2=Jeffery A. |editor-last2=Wittung |title=Partakers of the Divine Nature |publisher=Associated University Presses |year=2007 |isbn=0-8386-4111-3 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John Paul II]] repeatedly emphasized his respect for Eastern theology as an enrichment for the whole Church, declaring that, even after the painful division between the Christian East and the See of Rome, that theology has opened up profound thought-provoking perspectives of interest to the entire Church. He spoke in particular of the [[hesychast controversy]]. The term "hesychasm", he said, refers to a practice of prayer marked by deep tranquillity of the spirit intent on contemplating God unceasingly by invoking the name of Jesus. While from a Catholic viewpoint there have been tensions concerning some developments of the practice, the Pope said, there is no denying the goodness of the intention that inspired its defence, which was to stress that man is offered the concrete possibility of uniting himself in his inner heart with God in that profound union of grace known as ''theosis'', divinization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rumkatkilise.org/byzpope.htm Pope John Paul II and the East Pope John Paul II. "Eastern Theology Has Enriched the Whole Church" (11 August 1996). English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/angelus/1996/documents/hf_jp-ii_ang_19960811_it.html Original text (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the treasures of "the venerable and ancient tradition of the Eastern Churches" with which he said Catholics should be familiar, so as to be nourished by it, he mentioned in particular "the teaching of the Cappadocian Fathers on divinization (which) passed into the tradition of all the Eastern Churches and is part of their common heritage. This can be summarized in the thought already expressed by Saint Irenaeus at the end of the second century: God passed into man so that man might pass over to God. This theology of divinization remains one of the achievements particularly dear to Eastern Christian thought."&lt;ref group=Primary&gt;{{citation|title=ORIENTALE LUMEN|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_02051995_orientale-lumen_en.html|author=John Paul II|authorlink=John Paul II|language=Latin|trans-title=Eastern Light|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mormonism ==
{{Main article|Exaltation (Mormonism)|Degrees of glory}}
[[Mormonism]] includes a belief in the doctrine of [[Exaltation (LDS Church)|exaltation]], by which is meant a literal divinization. According to Mormon scholars, there are similarities between the Mormon belief of eternal progression and the beliefs found in the patristic writings of the first, second, and third centuries A.D.&lt;ref name="Millet and Reynolds 1998"&gt;{{citation |last= Millet |first= Robert L. |authorlink= Robert L. Millet |last2= Reynolds |first2= Noel B. |authorlink2= Noel B. Reynolds |year= 1998 |contribution= Do Latter-day Saints believe that men and women can become gods? |contribution-url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=45&amp;chapid=534 |title= Latter-day Christianity: 10 Basic Issues |location= Provo, Utah |publisher= [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] |isbn= 0934893322 |oclc= 39732987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mormonism's founder, [[Joseph Smith]], through obedience to Christ and the gradual acquisition of knowledge, the faithful may eventually become heirs of God in the afterlife and "inherit all things" as Christ himself "inherited all things." Mormons believe they will continue to worship and be subject to God the Father in the name of Christ in the afterlife.

Mormons do not characterize the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in terms of an immaterial, formless substance or essence that sets godhood apart as a separate genus from humanity. They believe this classification of divinity was originated by post-apostolic theologians, whose speculations on God were influenced by Greek metaphysical philosophers&lt;ref&gt;Shanna Butler, [//www.lds.org/liahona/2005/02/what-happened-to-christs-church "What Happened to Christ's Church"], ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'', February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], who described their notions of deity in similar terms of a divine substance/essence ([[ousia]])—i.e., terms which were unknown to the pre-Nicean Christian world. Mormons believe that through modern day revelation, God restored the doctrine that all humans are spiritually begotten (Hebrews 12:9, Acts 17:28–29) sons and daughters of Heavenly Father,&lt;ref&gt;[//www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-2-our-heavenly-family "Chapter 2: Our Heavenly Family"], ''[[Gospel Principles]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah, LDS Church, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and thus are all part of the same heavenly family. Because humans are literally God's children, they can also be heirs of his glory, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ (Romans 8:16–17).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = //www.lds.org/topics/becoming-like-god | title = Gospel Topics: Becoming Like God | work = lds.org | publisher = LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that the "glory of God is intelligence, in other words, light and truth" ([http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.36?lang=eng#35 D&amp;C 93:36]), therefore the process of inheriting his glory is a process of learning. As a crucial step in this process, all of God's spirit children had the choice to come to earth in order to receive a body and continue their development. Mormons believe that the fallen state of humanity (mortality) was not the result of an unplanned cancellation of God's plan for an eternal earthly paradise, rather it was a crucial step that provides the opportunity to learn and grow in the face of opposition ([http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11,25#10 2 Nephi 2:11, 25]). Thus, the purpose of earth life is to gain knowledge and experience—which includes overcoming trials and mistakes through the atonement of Jesus Christ, and using the lessons learned to become stronger and wiser, more like their Heavenly Father ([http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.3#2 D&amp;C 98:3]). Those who endure to the end (Matthew 24:13, Mark 13:13) while in mortality, as well as those who accept the gospel after death (see [[baptism for the dead]]), will be able to dwell in the presence of God, where they can continue to grow in light and truth, which "light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day" ([http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.24#23 D&amp;C 50:24]). Mormons believe that the Father and the Son both possess glorified, immortal bodies ([http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22#21 D&amp;C 130:22]), and that thanks to Christ's resurrection, humans will also resurrect and inherit this same type of body (Philippians 3:21).

'''Eddie Lee Long''' (May 12, 1953 – January 15, 2017) was an American [[pastor]] who served as the senior pastor of [[New Birth Missionary Baptist Church]], a [[megachurch]] in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[DeKalb County, Georgia]], from 1987 until his death in 2017.

When Long started as pastor for New Birth Church, there were 300 church members, which grew to 25,000.&lt;ref name="SST"/&gt; During this time, Long was a subject of a [[United States Senate inquiry into the tax-exempt status of religious organizations|Senate investigation]], concerning whether he personally profited from his church's tax-exempt status, which eventually ended without a finding of wrongdoing. Also, civil lawsuits were filed against him alleging [[sexual abuse]] of underage male members of his parish. Long denied wrongdoing through his attorneys and privately settled the lawsuits out of court for undisclosed amounts.

Long claimed to hold a [[PhD|doctorate]] in "Pastoral Ministry" from the unaccredited [[Robb Thompson|International College of Excellence]], which is not recognized by either the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] or [[United States Department of Education]], the two institutions responsible for recognizing educational accrediting institutions in the United States&lt;ref name="degreenet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.degree.net/guides/non-gaap_listings.html|title=Accrediting Agencies Not Recognized Under GAAP|publisher=Degree.net|year=2008|accessdate=March 23, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308052626/http://www.degree.net/guides/non-gaap_listings.html|archivedate=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quackwatch"&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/dm3.html Great Moments in Accreditation: The Case of IAC, ACI, and The Three Stooges], quackwatch.org, January 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and ministry==
Following his dismissal from Ford, he moved to Atlanta to study theology and became the pastor of a small [[Jonesboro, Georgia]] church.&lt;ref name="SST"/&gt; In 1987 he became the pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, which at the time had around 300 members. Under Long, membership grew to 25,000.&lt;ref name="SST"/&gt;  The church may be considered part of the [[Bapticostal movement]].&lt;ref name="Watch this!2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walton|first=Jonathan L.|title=Watch this!

Houston in 1981 and they were divorced soon afterwards. The couple have a son, Edward Long. Houston said she was the victim of "cruel treatment" and was afraid of Long's "violent and vicious temper," according to Fulton County Superior Court records. She and her son allegedly "had to flee the couple's Fairburn home in order to ensure their safety". Long vigorously denied the allegations and in 1985 Houston was awarded custody of the then 2-year-old son.&lt;ref name="1stmarr"/&gt;

Long married Vanessa Griffin in 1990. After he was accused of sexually molesting young fatherless boys in the church, she filed for divorce in December 2011.&lt;ref name="ajc"/&gt; On the same day New Birth's public relations firm claimed that she had rethought her decision and would withdraw her petition: "Upon further prayerful reflection Vanessa Long is withdrawing the divorce petition." However Griffin's attorneys later confirmed that she would continue with the divorce.&lt;ref name="ajc"/&gt; In response, Long stated that he would be taking a leave of absence from his ministry in an attempt to save his marriage, and that "he needed time to take care of 'some family business.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Severson|first=Kim|title=Charismatic Church Leader, Dogged by Scandal, to Stop Preaching for Now|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/05/us/eddie-long-beleaguered-church-leader-to-stop-preaching.html?hpw|accessdate=December 5, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, New Birth Christian Academy, founded by Long, announced it was closing due to lack of donations and "sending hundreds of students scrambling to find a new school by the following week", in the wake of Long's marital and sexual problems.&lt;ref name="ajc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boone|first=Christian (with Ernie Suggs)|title=New Birth academy closes; hundreds of students looking for new school|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/dekalb/new-birth-academy-closes-1276758.html|accessdate=December 28, 2011|newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=December 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615193116/http://www.ajc.com/news/dekalb/new-birth-academy-closes-1276758.html|archivedate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2012, one of Long's lawyers, Lawrence Cooper, confirmed to ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' that Vanessa Long had asked that the divorce petition be dismissed. Cooper declined to say if the Longs were reunited. In an emailed response to the AJC, Vanessa's lawyers declined to comment.&lt;ref name="cancel"&gt;{{cite news|last = Seward| first =Christopher |date = February 17, 2012| url = http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/vanessa-long-calls-off-divorcing-new-birth-pastor-/nQRQf | title = Vanessa Long calls off divorcing New Birth pastor Bishop Eddie Long| work = [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | accessdate = March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 5, 2012, during the Heart to Heart Women's Ministry Conference at New Birth, Vanessa Long stated that while she struggled with the decision to divorce Long following those accusations of sexual misconduct with male minors, she chose to return to her marriage and to the New Birth family so she could share her experience and offer guidance for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weber |first=Katherine |title=Bishop Eddie Long Divorce Storm Discussed by Wife Vanessa Long |url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/eddie-long-divorce-storm-discussed-by-wife-vanessa-long-81141/ |date=June 21, 2014 |accessdate=June 7, 2015 |publisher=Christian Post Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological beliefs==
In 1994, Long was given the title "bishop" in the [[Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship]], a group of black Baptist churches that embraced Pentecostal practices.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, John. "Titles from God: What's in a title? Quite a lot, to a new generation of pastors who leave 'the Rev.' behind in favor of more elaborate designations." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. January 12, 2002. p. B.1&lt;/ref&gt; Long's sermons, writings and teachings emphasize a "chain of command"&lt;ref name="Watch this!"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walton|first=Jonathan L.|title=Watch this! The ethics and aesthetics of black televangelism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTARmAEACAAJ|date=February 1, 2009|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=978-0-8147-9417-3|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; between certain superiors and subordinates characterized by "respect, submission and obedience". Long saw the first link in the chain as being a man choosing to be respectful, submissive and obedient to God. A woman chooses to be respectful, submissive and obedient to her father or husband. To live otherwise is to be outside of the divinely established order, and will result in the loss of spiritual and natural benefits.&lt;ref name="Watch this!"/&gt;

==Career events==
In 2006, Long was chosen by the family of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] to host and officiate the funeral for Mrs. [[Coretta Scott King]], wife of the late civil rights pioneer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5194215|title=New Birth Missionary Church Hosts King's Funeral|publisher=NPR|date=February 7, 2006|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was attended by four [[President of the United States|Presidents]] ([[George H. W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[Jimmy Carter]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNamara|first=Melissa|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/06/national/main1283675_page2.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody|title=Four Presidents Join 10,000 Mourners At Coretta Scott King's Funeral|publisher=cbsnews.com|date=February 7, 2006|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long was a prominent supporter of George W. Bush's [[faith-based initiatives]].&lt;ref name="GAP"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ga. Pastor Who Backed Bush 'Faith-Based' Plan Under Fire Over Salary|journal=Church &amp; State|volume=58|issue=9|pages=16–17|date=October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ministry received a $1 million grant from the [[U.S. Administration for Children &amp; Families]].&lt;ref name="GAP"/&gt; Rev. Timothy McDonald suggested a link between Long's anti-gay activity and the grant saying "If you look at the black pastors who have come out with the faith-based money, they're the same ones who have come out with campaigns on the gay marriage issue."&lt;ref name="GAP"/&gt; On January 31, 2012, a video was released depicting a ceremony at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church wherein [[Messianic Jewish]] preacher Ralph Messer presented a [[Torah scroll]] to Long, wrapped him in it, and symbolically elevated him to a position of spiritual kingship before a cheering congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|AVkoQHCXSK8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jewish leaders objected and characterized the ceremony as disrespectful to the Jewish faith and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/02/02/jewish-leaders-offended-by-ga-preachers-ceremony|work=Fox News|title=Jewish leaders offended by Ga. preacher's ceremony|date=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Salary and Senate investigation===
In 2005, the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' reported that between 1997 and 2000, Long received more than $3.07 million worth of [[compensation and benefits]] from his non-profit charity, 'Bishop Eddie Long Ministries Inc.' Long contended that the charity did not solicit donations from members but instead gained its income from royalties, speaking fees and several large donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blake|first=John|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/2005-ajc-report-bishop-619032.html|title=Bishop's charity generous to bishop|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=August 28, 2005|accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 a three-year investigation by the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance]] into the tax-exempt status of six ministries, including Long's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16860611|title=Senator Probes Megachurches' Finances|publisher=NPR.org|first=Kathy|last=Lohr|date=December 4, 2007|accessdate=December 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that there were no definitive findings of wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="NBCNEWS.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40960871/ns/politics-capitol_hill/t/televangelists-escape-penalty-senate-inquiry/#.URiVeTsiGYV|title=Televangelists escape penalty in Senate inquiry|last=Zoll|first=Rachel|date=July 1, 2011|publisher=NBCNEWS.com|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donations to the church dropped significantly following the investigation of Long's salary and church finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bishop Long's church takes financial hit after scandal|work=Michigan Chronicle|location=Detroit, Mich|date=March 9, 2011|page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching regarding sexual orientation===
[[CNN]] has said "Long frequently denounces homosexual behavior."&lt;ref name="cnn092310"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/09/23/georgia.pastor.allegations/index.html?hpt=T1|title=Atlanta pastor cancels interview, news conference about sex scandal|date=September 23, 2010|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=CNN Wire Staff|accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long has ministered "homosexual cure" programs to recruit gays and lesbians for what he called "Sexual Reorientation" conferences and his church offers an ongoing "Out of the Wilderness" ministry to help [[conversion therapy|convert]] homosexuals into heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=C.D.|last=Kirven|url=http://lezgetreal.com/2010/09/%e2%80%9cministering-treachery%e2%80%9d-the-truth-concerning-bishop-eddie-long%e2%80%99s-spiritual-wilderness|title="Ministering Treachery", The Truth Concerning Bishop Eddie Long’s Spiritual Wilderness|publisher=lezgetreal.com|date=September 23, 2010|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Long led a march with [[Bernice King]] to the grave of her father, Martin Luther King, Jr. The march was a protest against [[same-sex marriage]] and in support of a [[Federal Marriage Amendment|national constitutional amendment]] to limit marriage rights to couples comprising "one man and one woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/21/eddie-long-atlanta-bishop-sexual-abuse-allegations_n_733953.html|title=Eddie Long, Atlanta Bishop, Denies Accusations Of Sexual Abuse By Male Parishioners|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 21, 2010|accessdate=September 23, 2010|first=Jeff|last=Muskus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-12-11/news/17455504_1_same-sex-marriage-rev-bernice-king-bishop-eddie-long|title=Atlanta 'legacy' march troubles rights leaders/King's daughter in anti-gay marriage protest|date=December 11, 2004|first=Ellen|last=Barry|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Long's appearance at [[Atlanta]]'s [[Interdenominational Theological Center]]'s spring graduation led to [[Black theology|Black theologian]] [[James Hal Cone|James Cone]]—who was scheduled to receive an honorary degree—to boycott the ceremony. Thirty-three graduating seniors sent a letter to the seminary's president "questioning Long's theological and ethical integrity to be their commencement speaker." Many students did not agree with Long's beliefs that God can "[[Conversion therapy|deliver]]" homosexuals and his teachings on [[Prosperity Theology|prosperity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1096044091.html|title=Bishop Eddie Long tackles controversy|work=[[New Pittsburgh Courier]]|date=May 17, 2006|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 article in the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]'s magazine called him "one of the most virulently [[Homophobia|homophobic]] black leaders in the religiously based anti–gay movement."&lt;ref name="cnn092310"/&gt;

===Allegations of sexual impropriety and lawsuits===
In September 2010, Maurice Robinson, Anthony Flagg, Jamal Parris and Spencer LeGrande filed separate [[lawsuit]]s alleging that Long used his pastoral influence to coerce them into sexual relationships with him.&lt;ref name="cnn092110"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/09/21/georgia.pastor.abuse/?hpt=Sbin|title=Men allege sexual coercion by prominent Atlanta pastor|publisher=CNN.com|date=September 21, 2010|accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matterucci|first=Megan|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/third-lawsuit-filed-against-618703.html|title=Third lawsuit filed against Bishop Eddie Long|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=September 22, 2010|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slfiles"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=11721274|title=4th Man Sues Ga.

The lawsuits stated that Long would "discuss the [[Religious text|Holy Scripture]] to justify and support the sexual activity."&lt;ref name="ajc0923102"/&gt; Long denied the allegations through his attorneys and spokesman.

On September 26, Long spoke to the New Birth congregation but he did not address the issue directly. Long spoke of painful times and said, "I've been accused. I'm under attack.

It took an investigative look at the allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by Long with young men in his care.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Weight loss and death==
In August 2016, Long received major attention on [[Twitter]] when he posted a video on [[Facebook]] of himself which showed his drastic weight loss.

The medieval Irish office of '''erenagh''' ([[Old Irish]]: ''airchinnech'', [[Modern Irish]]: ''airchinneach'', [[Latin]]: ''[[princeps]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ie/books?id=g6yq2sKLlFkC&amp;pg=PA630&amp;dq=latin+erenagh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHx637uv7bAhUsCsAKHXNVBt8Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;) was responsible for receiving parish revenue from tithes and rents, building and maintaining church property and overseeing the [[termonn]] lands that generated parish income. Thus he had a [[prebendary]] role.  The erenagh originally had a tonsure but took no other holy orders; he had a voice in the Chapter when they consulted about revenues, paid a yearly rent to the Bishop and a fine on the marriage of each daughter. The role usually passed down from generation to generation in certain families in each parish. After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] the role of erenagh became subsumed in the responsibilities of the [[parson]] in each parish.

==Surname==
The common surname [[McInerney]] is derived from the Irish, Mac an Airchinnigh (son of the erenagh). As may be supposed, this surname arose in various areas in Ireland leading to numerous unrelated bearers of the name. The most prominent group of the family were associated with the County of Clare since at least the late 13th century when they were first recorded in the annals of the county and are still numerous in that county today. This sept was subordinate to the McNamaras and it was from them that the family originally derived. The McInerneys in County Clare were based in the Barony of [[Lower Bunratty]] on their ancestral estates in and around the present day townlands of Ballysallagh, Ballynacragga and Dromoland (parish of [[Kilnasoolagh]]). Members of the family held substantial property there until the Cromwellian confiscations of the 1650s, whereby several members of the family were transplanted to other areas of the County, in part due to their involvement in the 1641 rebellion. Today the name is numerous in County Clare, Limerick and Dublin, and can be found in the United States, Canada, Australia, England and New Zealand.

The '''Festival of Muslim Cultures''', a national celebration of Muslim cultures held in the United Kingdom, began in January 2006 and ended July 2007. It imitated an earlier event in 1976.  

From official site;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimcultures.org/index2.php?option=home Festival of Muslim Cultures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation broken|date=September 2008}}
''The festival was created out of the need to encourage a better understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims (as a two-way process), to promote respect for Muslim cultures and to demonstrate how culture creates the pathways that connect us all together.''  Organizers say that festival events were chosen because they represent the best of the Muslim arts world and they "portray diversity and plurality".

==Festival's organisation==
[[Prince Charles]] was a patron &amp; the festival director is [[Isabel Carlisle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimcultures.org/index2.php?option=whoiswho Festival of Muslim Cultures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation broken|date=September 2008}} Shiban Akbar of the [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] was on the Advisory Board.&lt;ref name="10000115FestivalofMuslimCultures2005.pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlanorthwest.org.uk/assets/documents/10000115FestivalofMuslimCultures2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009081957/http://www.mlanorthwest.org.uk/assets/documents/10000115FestivalofMuslimCultures2005.pdf |archivedate=9 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trustees===
* Raficq Abdulla [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (Lawyer, interpreter of Rumi and Attar, broadcaster and writer)
* Mahmood Ahmed ([[Corporate Lawyer]] and former President of the [[Ismaili]] Council for the UK)
* Majid Dawood (CEO of Yasaar, [[Shariah]] compliance services company)
* Sayyed Nadeem Kazmi (Head of [[International Development]], Al-Khoei Foundation, London)
* Shahwar Sadeque (Former BBC Governor and former Commissioner of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]])
As a founder trustee, the late [[Zaki Badawi|Dr Zaki Badawi]] played a key role from the beginning in shaping the Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-2008577_2,00.html | work=The Times | location=London | accessdate=2010-05-02 | first=Anushka | last=Asthana}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The festival, a [[registered charity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?regno=1106292&amp;submit=Run+Search charity number 1106292]&lt;/ref&gt; receives government funding from; [[Arts Council England]], City of London, [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)]], [[Home Office]] and [[British Council]].&lt;ref&gt; Other sponsors were listed at http://www.muslimcultures.org/index2.php?option=sponsors&lt;/ref&gt; It has a provisional budget of £6,000,000 which is around $10,500,000 USD.&lt;ref name="10000115FestivalofMuslimCultures2005.pdf"/&gt;

==Controversy==
In August 2005, [[The Observer]] reported that the [[Muslim Council of Britain|Muslim Council of Britain (MCB)]] used its influence in [[Whitehall]] to gain a place on the festival's board of trustees. Festival organisers were instructed to comply with Islamic [[sharia law]] to gain the [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB's]] full support. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The organisers are now concerned that the festival will lose political backing if they invite performers who are seen to be 'un-Islamic'. Festival organisers already hope to invite the Uzbek singer, Sevara Nezarkhan, who does not wear the headscarf or '[[hijab]]' and has worked with [[Jewish]] '[[klezmer]]' musicians. It also intends to exhibit the 14th-century world history of [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid al-Din]], which represents the human form and the prophet [[Mohammed]] himself, thought by some strict Muslims to be forbidden. Other performers could include the [[Senegalese]] musician [[Youssou N'dour]] and the [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]]-British dancer Akram Khan. The Observer understands that the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] insisted that the festival organisers involved the [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] before they would give them their full backing. As a result, an [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] nominee has been taken on to the festival's board of trustees. One source close to the festival organisers said, "We constantly found our efforts were being blocked and it kept coming back to the MCB and its sympathisers within Whitehall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1548786,00.html| title=Radical links of UK's 'moderate' Muslim group| date=14 August 2005| publisher=The Observer| accessdate=2006-09-21 | location=London | first=Martin | last=Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] responded with, "The MCB believes that the Festival will need to be broad-based, inclusive and mindful of the teachings of Islam if it is to have the support of British Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mcb.org.uk/media/presstext.php?ann_id=159| date=14 August 2005| title=MCB Responds to The Observer's 'Investigation'| publisher=The Muslim Council of Britain| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209071852/http://www.mcb.org.uk/media/presstext.php?ann_id=159| archivedate=9 February 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just days after the controversy surrounding [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] Secretary General [[Iqbal Sacranie]]'s [[Muslim Council of Britain#Support and criticism|comments on homosexuality]], the conservative British Muslim establishment became embroiled in another [[homophobia]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060123sacranie.shtml Sacranie charge dropped, but Muslim gay row continues – news from ekklesia | Ekklesia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 January 2006 Sandra Laville reported in [[The Guardian]], 'Promotional publicity states that the festival will feature the 'diversity and plurality' of Muslim cultures, but gay Muslims say they have been refused permission to present an event.’
[[Aaron Saeed]], Muslim affairs spokesman for the gay rights group [[OutRage!]], wrote to festival director [[Isabel Carlisle]], offering to stage an event celebrating the lives and experiences of gay Muslims in Britain and abroad but his offer was refused.&lt;ref name="0,2763,1692804,00.html"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,2763,1692804,00.html?gusrc=rss| title=Festival of Muslim cultures refuses to allow gay event| first=Sandra | last=Laville| date=23 January 2006| publisher=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Isabel Carlisle]]'s reply, she justifies the exclusion of gay Muslims on the grounds 'we are not prepared to present works that will give offence to significant numbers.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/muslimcultures.htm Blasphemy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when interviewed for [[The Guardian]] she claimed that gay Muslim participation was rejected because the festival does not want to feature 'political' themes.&lt;ref name="0,2763,1692804,00.html"/&gt;

“This is not what her rejection letter states," said [[Aaron Saeed]]. "It says we have been turned down because gay Muslims would give offence. Our proposal was not political. It was for a series of cultural events about the lives and experiences of lesbian and gay Muslims. We planned to organise these events in conjunction with gay Muslim individuals and organisations beyond [[OutRage!]]. These were never envisaged as [[OutRage!]] events. We made that clear. This ban is straightforward homophobia. It is deeply offensive to suggest that gay Muslim people are not a valid part of the Muslim community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outrage.org.uk/pressrelease.asp?ID=333 |title=OutRage! press release – Muslim Festival bans gay Muslims |accessdate=2006-09-21 |df=dmy }}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (404 error as of last access date)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saeed concludes, "It is appalling that a registered charity is allowed to discriminate against gay people ... It is time the conservative leadership of the Muslim community got used to the fact that gay Muslims are here to stay and here to fight."
Muhammad Yusuf, a member of the [[Inter-religious Organisations|Interfaith Alliance]], said it was a "matter of regret" that a festival aiming to reflect the diversity of Muslim culture was not prepared to take on board a facet that was different by reason of sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="0,2763,1692804,00.html"/&gt;

==Events of the Festival==
Initial events included
*The historical exhibition "Palace and Mosque: Islamic Treasure of the Middle East from the [[V&amp;A]]" at [[Sheffield]] Millennium Galleries, drawn from one of the most renowned [[Islamic art]] collections in the world.

*"Contemporary Pakistani Printmakers" at Oriel Ceri Richards, [[Swansea]].
*"Charity, Orphans &amp; Foundlings In the Pre-Modern Islamic World," lecture by [[Gerald Hawting|Dr. Gerald Hawting]] from [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]] held at the [[Foundling Museum]].
Other events planned by the Festival's programme partners ranged from drama from the Middle East; a colourful contribution to the [[Edinburgh Festival]]s; a conference on "Faith and Identity in Contemporary Culture" in [[Manchester]]; a gathering of poets in [[Bradford]] and [[Leeds]]; contemporary British Muslim artists in [[Birmingham]]; a Pakistani film festival in Glasgow as well as a [[Sufi]] Festival; Muslim writers at the [[Hay-on-Wye|Hay Literary Festival]]; [[Quranic]] recitation in [[Leicester]]; an arts programme in [[Cardiff]]; and early music in [[York]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3060">'''Francis John McConnell''' (August 18, 1871 &amp;ndash; August 18, 1953) was an [[United States|American]] social reformer and a [[bishop]] in the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], elected in 1912.

Born on August 18, 1871, in [[Trinway, Ohio]], he died on August 18, 1953, in [[Lucasville, Ohio]].

McConnell was a graduate of the [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] and the [[Boston University School of Theology]].  He was an ordained minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church for many years, serving among other places a large church in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

Before election to the [[episcopacy]], McConnell served as the president of [[DePauw University]], [[Greencastle, Indiana]], 1909-1912.  During his presidency he led the university's first major fund drive, the Campaign for the Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Fund, which produced a total subscription of $550,546.

Francis John McConnell was a major second-generation advocate of [[Boston personalism]] who sought to apply the philosophy to social problems of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burrow Jr. |first=Rufus  |title=Francis John McConnell and personalistic social ethics |work=Methodist History |volume=31 |number=2 |year=1993 |hdl=10516/5872 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10516/5872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8354">{{Status of religious freedom}}
'''Freedom of religion in Italy''' is guaranteed under the [[Constitution of Italy|1947 constitution]] of the [[Italian Republic]]. Before that religious toleration was provided for by the constitution of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] which in turn derived from the [[Albertine Statute]] granted to his subjects by [[Carlo Alberto]] of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in 1848, the [[Revolutions of 1848|Year of Revolutions]].

==History==
Article 1 of the Albertine Statute identified [[Roman Catholicism]] as the single [[state religion|religion of state]] but declared that other existing confessions were tolerated in conformance with the laws.&lt;ref&gt;'La Religione Cattolica, Apostolica e Romana è la sola Religione dello Stato. Gli altri culti ora esistenti sono tollerati conformemente alle leggi.' Article 1 of the ''Statuto albertino''. [[:s:it:Italia, Regno - Statuto albertino|Full text of the ''Statuto'']] from Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration led rapidly to the opening of the ghettoes and the emancipation of the [[Waldensians]]. Toleration was limited however: Article 28, while declaring that there should be a free press, stated specifically that Bibles, [[catechism]]s, [[liturgies]] and [[prayer books]] could not be printed without episcopal permission; religious propaganda was also prohibited by the state.&lt;ref name="Maselli"&gt;Domenico Maselli, [http://www.buddhismo.it/ente/InteseReligiose.htm ‘Breve scheda sulle Intese tra lo Stato e le Confessioni Religiose diverse dalla Cattolica’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619163958/http://www.buddhismo.it/ente/InteseReligiose.htm |date=2010-06-19 }}, Unione Buddhista Italiana,  June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in the years leading up to the [[unification of Italy]] the Kingdom of Sardinia was more tolerant than other states on the peninsula: in the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] the practice of religions other than Catholicism was punishable by imprisonment or exile.&lt;ref name="Maselli"/&gt;

The Kingdom of Italy inherited in effect the Piedmontese-Sardinian constitution and on 18 March 1871 a major advance in religious freedom in the country was made by an [[order of the day]] introduced by the liberal reformist [[Pasquale Stanislao Mancini]] which established that all religions should be treated equally.&lt;ref name="Maselli"/&gt;

The Fascist period was marked by the [[Concordat]] between the state and the Catholic Church, known as the [[Lateran treaty]] of 1929. Other Christian denominations and other religions, however, faced renewed repression. In 1935 the [[Pentecostal Church|Pentecostals]] were declared prejudicial to the integrity of the race. [[Salvationists]] and [[Jehova's Witnesses]], as well as the Pentecostals were liable to imprisonment or exile&lt;!--source has ‘furono spesso inviati al confino o imprigionati’--&gt; while other minority Christian groups faced notable restrictions.&lt;ref name="Maselli"/&gt; Although [[antisemitism]] was not embedded in [[Italian Fascism]] from the start, in order to please his ally [[Adolf Hitler]], in the late 1930s [[Benito Mussolini]] approved the [[Italian Racial Laws]]. In the latter stages of the [[Second World War]], in particular during the period of the [[Italian Social Republic]] and of German occupation of much of the peninsula, many Jews, as well as non-jew political dissidents and even Catholic priests, were deported to the Nazi death camps.

The 1947 Constitution of the Italian Republic enshrined religious freedoms in passages including the following:

{{quote|
All citizens have equal social dignity and are equal before the law, without distinction of […], religion [….] (Article 3)

All religious confessions are equally free before the law. (Article 8)

All have the right to profess freely their own religious faith in whatever form […], provided that the rites are not contrary to morality. (Article 19)}}

Various laws enacted during the Fascist period remained in force, however, and a number of trials took place involving Pentecostals and Jehova's Witnesses. This changed in 1955 with the advent of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]] which abolished or modified legislation on relevant matters which it found inconsistent with the constitutional guarantees of religious freedom.&lt;ref name="Maselli"/&gt;

In 1984, following a revised accord with the Vatican, Catholicism lost its status as the official religion of the Italian state&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8340411.stm ‘Italy school crucifixes “barred”’], BBC News, 3 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Italy became a [[Secular state|secular state]].

Controversy however remains, particularly abroad, over certain Fascist-era laws that are still in force and that have not been declared unconstitutional. In 2009 the [[European Court of Human Rights]], in a case brought by an Italian mother who wanted her children to have a secular education, ruled against the display of crucifixes in the classrooms of Italian state schools. It found that 'The compulsory display of a symbol of a given confession in premises used by the public authorities… restricted the right of parents to educate their children in conformity with their convictions' and that it restricted the 'right of children to believe or not to believe'.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; This ruling was in marked contrast with the position of the Italian courts that had ruled in 2005 that crucifixes were allowed to be present in polling stations and, in 2006, that display of crucifixes in state schools was allowed on the basis that the crucifix symbolised core Italian social values.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Barnett, [http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0441-e.htm#d3italy ‘Freedom of Religion and Religious Symbols in the Public Sphere’], Law and Government Division of the Canadian Parliament, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of religion in Italy today==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
[[Italy]] is a predominantly [[Roman Catholic]] country, with minorities of [[Muslims]] (mostly from recent [[immigration]]), Sikhs and [[Jew]]s. Christian [[Protestantism in Italy|Protestants]] are historically few. A few Protestants, such as two-time [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] [[Sidney Sonnino]], have distinguished themselves.

97.67% of Italians are baptised according to the rite of the Catholic Church. According to a survey of Eurispes 2006,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cesnur.org/2001/enc/aggsoc072001.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 87.8% of the population declares itself Catholic and 36.8% practitioner. However a large percentage of Catholics do not necessarily support all the directions of the Church, as demonstrated by the referendum about [[divorce]] or [[abortion]].

The Catholic Church was the [[State church]] until it was de facto disestablished with the 1948 [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]], then definitely with the 1984 revision of the [[Lateran Treaty]]. Now Italy is a [[Secular state|secular state]]

In Italy in 2006 there were 53 million Christians, 4 million Atheists and Agnostics, 1.2 million Muslims, 160,000 Buddhists, 115,000 Hindus, 70,000 Sikhs, 45,000 Jews and 15,000 Pagans.

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] holds considerable influence on some [[political parties]]. The fact that the Roman Catholic Church has a direct influence on political parties is object of controversy among those who favour the independence of politics and in particular among those whose views on  divorce, abortion, euthanasia and same-sex marriages are opposed to Christian ethics and in particular to [[Catholic doctrine]].

Usage of Catholic [[Christian symbolism|symbolism]] (especially crosses) in courts and schools has been contested by minorities, but was ruled legal; some contend that this is in violation of the principles of [[religious freedom]] outlined in the [[Constitution of Italy]].

'''Georgian Wicca''' is a tradition, or [[Religious denomination|denomination]], in the [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]]. In its organisation, it is very similar to [[British Traditional Wicca]] groups such as [[Gardnerian Wicca]], however, it does not trace its initiatory line to one of the old English covens. 

The name "Georgian" refers to its founder, George Patterson, who founded the tradition in 1970 in the [[United States]].

==History==
The Georgian Tradition was founded in 1970 by George Eliott (Pat) Patterson III, when he began teaching his first students, two women called Zanoni Silverknife and Tanith. It began as a small coven in Patterson’s home, in [[Bakersfield, California]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgianwicca.com/history.html |title=Georgian History |date=21 November 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825052809/http://www.georgianwicca.com/history.html |archivedate=25 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterson claimed to have received early teachings from members of a [[Celts|Celtic]] Coven in [[Boston]]. He told his early initiates when [[World War II]] began, he enlisted in the Armed Forces and served for four years. On his return to Boston, he found family members had destroyed his Book and ritual items. He could not find the family he'd studied with.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2009"/&gt; Despite research into this history, there is no independent evidence any such coven existed. At other times, he told students and initiates that he had been initiated into either the Alexandrian or Gardnerian Tradition, and at one point also claimed to have been initiated into the Craft by his father. Investigation of the claims of initiation into either the Alexandrian or Gardnerian Traditions have demonstrated no verification in the records of either of those traditions; initiation by his father can neither be proved nor disproved.

Soon after forming the group, Patterson applied to the State of California for legal status as an incorporated church and through the [[Universal Life Church]] had a charter (1971) and Ministerial credentials for himself and Silverknife.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2009"/&gt;

Patterson gathered information, lessons and lore from many helpful sources. These included Doris and Sylvester Stuart of England, [[Lady Gwen Thompson]] of the New England Covens of Traditionalist Witches (N.E.C.T.W.), and others. The Georgian Tradition is based on [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]] and [[Alexandrian Wicca]] practices, incorporating [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] lore from Leland, using those rites and rituals shared by the Sylvestrians and N.E.C.T.W. as well as material from New York Covens of Traditionalist Witches (N.Y.C.T.W); Lord Hermes (Edmund Buczynski) and Lady Siobhan (Order of the Silver Wheel) were most helpful. Many of the rituals are similar to those published in various books on what is sometimes called "[[British Traditional Wicca]]" (BTW), such as [[Janet Farrar|Janet]] and [[Stewart Farrar]]'s ''Eight Sabbats for Witches'' and ''The Witches' Way'', as well as the privately distributed version of what was later published as [[Ed Fitch]]'s ''Grimoire of the Shadows''.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2009"/&gt;

Georgian Wicca is therefore similar to Alexandrian and Gardnerian Wiccan practice, in that it is an initiatory line and oath-bound.  Georgian Wicca, however, is not a recognized member of the BTW, as it lacks an important requirement - initiatory lineage back to one of the BTW covens in England. Therefore, it is considered BTW-derived.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2009"/&gt;

== Newsletter days ==

Beginning in 1976, Patterson edited the "Georgian Newsletter", a chatty, informal correspondence that helped to build the community of Georgians and link them with one another. Following his death in 1984, the newsletter continued for a few years, and subsequently ceased publication. The newsletter contained bits of gossip, "Helpful Hints", book reviews, and the ever popular feature "Being a Witch is ... "&lt;ref name="Mitchell2009"/&gt;

Following a lengthy hiatus, the Georgian Newsletter was revived as a free publication in 2007 by members of the tradition, a current archive (as of May 2013) exists at [http://georgianwicca.com/newsletter/ The Georgian Wicca Tradition Newsletter].

== Present day ==

Georgians are now worldwide and growing; many are in the Armed Forces, carrying the Tradition with them. Recently, there has been an upsurge in those interested in reconnecting with or learning about the Georgian Tradition.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2009"/&gt;

At present, there are known Georgian Covens in [[British Columbia]], [[California]], [[Florida]], [[Oregon]], [[Colorado]], [[Maryland]], [[Michigan]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Utah]], and [[Oklahoma]]. There is also a current effort being made to reconnect members of the Tradition.

== Fictional depictions ==

In [[S. M. Stirling]]'s [[Emberverse]] series, the Singing Moon Coven, which forms the basis of the Wiccan Clan MacKenzie, is described as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;an eclectic Georgian group who favor Celtic symbolism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hem.bredband.net/b104699/books/dies/dies_8.html |title=Chapter 8 of ''Dies the Fire'' |accessdate=2009-04-14 |author=S.M. Stirling |year=2004 |work=Sample Chap |publisher=smstirling.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of aspects of Georgian Wiccan derived practice are portrayed in the series.

'''Gurudwara Reetha Sahib''' is situated in district [[Champawat]], [[Uttrakhand]], [[India]]. It is 16 hours journey away from [[Chandigarh]] (581 km) approx. This gurudwara holds a very sacred place in Sikh Religion as [[Guru Nanak Dev]] Ji himself had visited this place with [[Bhai Mardana]] JI.

==Religious Importance==

Gurdwara Meetha Reetha Sahib was constructed around year 1960 and is situated near the village Deyuri in Uttrakhand. [[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]] visited this place with [[Bhai Mardana Ji]]. There were Jogis sitting under the reetha ([[soapnut]]) trees. Guru Nanak Dev ji sat under a reetha tree and asked Bhai Mardana Ji to eat a reetha. Reethas are usually bitter in taste but the reetha which Guru Nanak Dev Ji plucked for Bhai Mardana Ji was sweet. Jogis were surprised by all this and later they come to know that on which side Guru Nanak Dev Ji was sitting all the reethas has become sweet. These trees are still there in the Gurudwara and the reethas are still said to be sweet in taste. This is the reason why this place is called Meetha Reetha Sahib. Even today the people who visits the Gurudwara gets sweet reethas (soapnuts) as [[prashad]]. Due to its religious background this place is considered as a holy place for Sikhs. The temple of Devnath is also located beside the Gurudwara. On Baisakhi purnima, Sikh fair is held in this Gurudwara as this place is very sacred.Gurudwara's first caretaker was Lala Baisakhi Ram from Haldwani.

'''Jambudvīpa''' ({{lang-sa| जम्बुद्वीप}}) is the [[dvīpa]] ("island" or "continent") of the terrestrial world, as envisioned in the cosmologies of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]], which is the realm where ordinary human beings live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/culture/jambudwipa-the-seeds-of-political-unity-in-the-indian-subcontinent|title=Jambudwipa: The Seeds Of Political Unity In The Indian Subcontinent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word Jambudvīpa literally refers to "the land of Jambu trees" where ''jambu'' is the name of the species (also called [[Jambul]] or Indian Blackberry) and ''dvīpa'' means "island" or "continent".

[[Surya Siddhanta]], an astronomical text, refers to [[Northern Hemisphere]] of the earth as Jambudvipa whereas the [[Southern hemisphere]] is referred to as [[Patala]].

==Puranic description as per Vedic cosmology==
[[File:Map of Jambudvipa Indian Hindu Cosmology.jpg|thumb|Map of Jambudvipa]]
According to [[Puranic]] cosmography, the world is divided into seven concentric island continents (''sapta-dvipa vasumati'') separated by the seven encircling oceans, each double the size of the preceding one (going out from within). The seven continents of the [[Purana]]s are stated as '''Jambudvipa''', [[Plaksadvipa]], [[Salmalidvipa]], [[Kusadvipa]], [[Krouncadvipa]], [[Sakadvipa]], and [[Pushkaradvipa]]. Seven intermediate oceans consist of salt-water, sugarcane juice, wine, [[ghee]], [[Dahi (curd)|yogurt]], milk and water respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agni Purana]] 108.1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Matsya Purana]] 121-122.&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain range called [[Lokaloka]], meaning "world-no-world", stretches across this final sea, delineating the known world from the dark void.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=AEQovil-HSoC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22lokaloka%22+hindu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir9sa5l5fdAhUh_IMKHcwmACIQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lokaloka%22%20hindu&amp;f=false|title=Hindu Myths|last=Dallapiccola|first=A. L.|date=November 2003|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=|isbn=9780292702332|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continent Jambudvipa (''[[Jambul|Indian Blackberry]] Island''), also known as ''Sudarshanadvipa'', forms the innermost concentric island in the above scheme. Its name is said to derive from a Jambu tree (another name for the [[Jambul|Indian Blackberry]]). The fruits of the Jambu tree are said, in the Viṣṇupurāṇa (ch.2) to be as large as elephants and when they become rotten and fall upon the crest of the mountains, a river of juice is formed from their expressed juice. The river so formed is called Jambunadi (Jambu river) and flows through Jambudvipa, whose inhabitants drink its waters. Insular continent Jambudvipa is said to comprise nine ''varshas'' (zones) and eight significant ''parvatas'' (mountains).

[[Markandeya Purana]] portrays Jambudvipa as being depressed on its south and north and elevated and broad in the middle. The elevated region forms the varsha named ''Ila-vrta'' or ''Meruvarsha''. At the center of Ila-vrta lies the golden [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Mount Meru]], the king of mountains. On the summit of Mount Meru, is the vast city of Lord [[Brahma]], known as ''Brahmapuri''. Surrounding  Brahmapuri are 8 cities -  the one of Lord [[Indra]] and of seven other ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Devatas]]''.

Markandeya Purana and [[Brahmanda Purana]] divide Jambudvipa into four vast regions shaped like four petals of a [[Indian lotus|lotus]] with Mount Meru being located at the center like a [[pericarp]]. The city of ''Brahmapuri'' is said to be enclosed by a river, known as ''Akash Ganga''. ''Akash Ganga'' is said to issue forth from the foot of Lord [[Vishnu]] and after washing the lunar region falls "through the skies" and after encircling the Brahmapuri "splits up into four mighty streams", which are said to flow in four opposite directions from the landscape of Mount Meru and irrigate the vast lands of Jambudvipa.&lt;ref&gt;Geographical Data in the Early Puranas. A Critical Study, Dr M. R. Singh: University of Rajasthan/Jaipur. Punthi Pustak, Calcutta. 1972. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The common names of the dvīpas, having their varṣas (9 for Jambu-dvīpa, 7 for the other dvīpas) with a mountain and a river in each varṣa, is given in several Purāṇas [http://texts.00.gs/cosmography,_Astika.htm]. There is a distinct set of names provides, however, in other Purāṇas [http://texts.00.gs/cosmography,_Astika_alternative.htm]. The most detailed geography is that described in the ''Vāyu Purāṇa'' [http://texts.00.gs/cosmography,_Vayu.htm].

==In Buddhism==
The [[Buddhist cosmology]] divides the {{IAST|bhūmaṇḍala}} (circle of the earth) into three separate levels: '''[[Buddhist cosmology#Desire Realm (Kāmadhātu)|Kāmadhātu]]''' (Desire realm), '''[[Buddhist cosmology#Form Realm (Rūpadhātu)|Rūpadhātu]]''' (Form realm), and '''[[Buddhist cosmology#Formless Realm (Ārūpyadhātu)|Ārūpyadhātu]]''' (Formless realm). In the Kāmadhātu is located Mount [[Sumeru]] which is said to be surrounded by four island-continents. "The southernmost island is called Jambudvīpa". The other three continents of Buddhist accounts around Sumeru are not accessible to humans from Jambudvīpa.  Jambudvīpa is shaped like a triangle with a blunted point facing south, somewhat like the Indian subcontinent.  In its center is a gigantic [[Syzygium cumini|Jambu]] tree from which the continent takes its name, meaning "Jambu Island".

Jambudipa, one of the four Mahādīpas，or great continents，which are included in the Cakkavāla and are ruled by a Cakkavatti．They are grouped round MountSineru．In Jambudīpa is Himavā with its eighty-four thousand peaks，its lakes，mountain ranges，etc.．

This continent derives its name from the Jambu-tree （also called Naga） which grows there，its trunk fifteen yojanas in girth，its outspreading branches fifty yojanas in length，its shade one hundred yojanas in extent and its height one hundred yojanas （Vin．i．30； SNA．ii．443； Vsm．i．205f； Sp．i．119，etc.．）．On account of this tree，Jambudīpa is also known as Jambusanda （SN．vs．552； SNA．i．121）．The continent is ten thousand yojanas in extent； of these ten thousand，four thousand are covered by the ocean，three thousand by the Himālaya mountains，while three thousand are inhabited by men （SNA．ii．437； UdA．300）．

Jambudvīpa is the region where the humans live and is the only place where a being may become enlightened by being born as a human being. It is in Jambudvīpa that one may receive the gift of [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and come to understand the [[Four Noble Truths]], the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and ultimately realize the liberation from the [[Samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of life and death]]. Another reference is from the Buddhist text [[Mahavamsa]], where the emperor [[Ashoka]]'s son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] introduces himself to the [[Sri Lanka]]n king [[Devanampiyatissa]] as from Jambudvipa, referring to what is now the Indian subcontinent.

According to [[Jain cosmology]], Jambūdvīpa is at the centre of Madhyaloka, or the middle part of the universe, where the humans reside. ''Jambūdvīpaprajñapti'' or the treatise on the island of Roseapple tree contains a description of Jambūdvīpa and life biographies of {{IAST|Ṛṣabha}} and King Bharata. ''Trilokasāra'' (Essence of the three worlds), ''Trilokaprajñapti'' (Treatise on the three worlds), ''Trilokadipikā'' (Illumination of the three worlds) and {{IAST|''Kṣetrasamāsa''}} (Summary of Jain geography) are the other texts that provide the details of Jambūdvīpa and Jain cosmology.

A '''Jewish cemetery''' ({{lang-he-n|בית עלמין}} ''beit almin'' or {{Hebrew|בית קברות}} ''beit kvarot'') is a [[cemetery]] where members of the [[Jewish]] faith are buried in keeping with [[Halakha|Jewish tradition]]. Cemeteries are referred to in several different ways in Hebrew, including ''bet kevarot'' (house of tombs), ''beit almin'' or ''bet olam'' (house of eternity), the ''bet chayyim'' (house of the [eternal] life) and ''bet shalom'' (house of peace).

The land of the cemetery is considered holy and a special consecration ceremony takes place upon its inauguration. According to Jewish tradition, Jewish burial grounds are sacred sites and must remain undisturbed in perpetuity. Establishing a cemetery is one of the first priorities for a new Jewish community. A Jewish cemetery is generally purchased and supported with communal funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iajgs.org/cemetery/what-makes-a-cemetery-jewish/index.html |title=IAJGS cemetery site |publisher=Iajgs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Showing proper respect for the dead (''kevod ha-met'') is intrinsic to Jewish law. The connection between the soul and the human body after death is an essential aspect of Jewish belief in the [[Soul#Judaism|eternity of the soul]]. Thus, disinterring the dead, deriving benefit from a corpse or grave, or acting in any way that may be perceived as "ridiculing the helpless" (''l’oeg l’rash''), such as making derogatory remarks or joking, but also partaking in the pleasures or needs of the living, such as eating, drinking or smoking, are forbidden in the presence of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamm|first1=M|title=The Jewish Way in Death and Mourning|date=2000|publisher=Jonathan David Company Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Showing proper respect for the dead also requires a [[Bereavement_in_Judaism#Burial|prompt burial]], the waiver of certain rabbinic restrictions on [[Shabbat]] and religious holidays to insure proper care of the dead, the ritual cleaning (''tahara'') and dressing of the body in shrouds (''tachrichim'') before burial, and laws concerning proper conduct in a cemetery.  

To ensure that the requirements for Jewish burial are met and that each member of the community is afforded a proper burial, Jewish communities establish burial societies known as the [[Chevra Kadisha]] (''The Holy Society'') to provide these services free of charge. In larger Jewish communities, cemeteries are sometimes subdivided into sections according to the ''chevra kadisha'' that uses and is responsible for that section of the cemetery's care and upkeep.
 
==History==
Early Jewish cemeteries were located outside of the city. In the [[Diaspora]], it is traditional to bury the dead with the feet in the direction of [[Jerusalem]]. The [[Headstone|tombstones]] usually have inscriptions in Hebrew and the regional language. During the [[Nazi Germany]] regime, Jewish cemeteries all over Europe were destroyed and desecrated.

The largest Jewish cemeteries of [[Europe]] can be found in [[Kozma Street Cemetery|Budapest]], [[Łódź]], [[New Jewish Cemetery, Prague|Prague]], [[Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery|Warsaw]], [[Zentralfriedhof|Vienna]] and [[Weißensee Cemetery|Berlin]]. Other Jewish cemeteries in Europe include the [[Jewish Cemetery in Khotyn]] and the [[Chatam Sofer Memorial]] (part of the Old Jewish Cemetery in [[Bratislava]]).

The '''Jewish view on birth control''' currently varies between the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] branches of Judaism. Among Orthodox Judaism, use of birth control has been considered only acceptable for use in limited circumstances. Conservative Judaism, while generally encouraging its members to follow the traditional Jewish views on birth control has been more willing to allow greater exceptions regarding its use to fit better within modern society. Reform Judaism has generally been the most liberal with regard to birth control allowing individual followers to use their own judgment in what, if any, birth control methods they might wish to employ.

Regulations regarding contraception affect the traditional streams of Judaism (including the [[Haredi]] and [[Modern Orthodox]] varieties) more so than others because of their strict adherence to Halakhah, or Jewish law.  These regulations affect liberal strains of Judaism (including the Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative movements; particularly in Western society) much less, where the emphasis is on applying [[Halakhah]] to modern life rather than observing it strictly.  Many modern Jews feel that the benefits of contraception, be they female health, family stability, or disease prevention, uphold the commandment in Judaism to "choose life" much more strongly than they violate the commandment to "[[Cultural mandate|be fruitful and multiply]]".

==Orthodox Judaism==
Among traditional interpretations of the [[Torah]], active prevention of pregnancy is in violation of the commandment "be fruitful and multiply" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|1:28|HE}}). Some [[Rabbi|Rabbinic authorities]]{{who|date=November 2012}} further consider the possibility (generally not accepted) that a union that by definition cannot lead to pregnancy would amount to "spilling seed", the sin of [[Onan]] ( {{bibleverse||Genesis|38:9-10|HE}}).  A woman’s obligation being overridden in Jewish law by the danger of childbirth which opens up the option of them taking steps toward preventing pregnancy.

The option of contraception is raised by the [[Talmud]] ([http://www.come-and-hear.com/yebamoth/yebamoth_12.html#PARTb tractate Yevamot 12b]), where the use of a [[Pessary#Occlusive pessaries|pessary]] is discussed for women who are too young to get pregnant, presently pregnant, or nursing. In each case, either the woman or her child is at risk for serious complications, and this is the basis for many [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic authorities]] permitting contraception in situations where pregnancy would seriously harm the woman. In those cases, the most "natural" method is preferred; as the use of a condom or pessary creates a physical barrier, "[[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]]" (or an [[intrauterine device]]) is preferred by most authorities. [[Fertility awareness]] methods (modern improvements over the [[calendar-based methods|rhythm method]]) are difficult to use, because many infertile days coincide with the ritually impure days of [[niddah]].

Orthodox rabbis believe that the positive commandment of being fruitful and multiplying is a male obligation. Consequently, wives may choose abstinence as birth control, but husbands are not permitted to decline their wives if they are not in niddah.

Contraceptive measures that lead to male sterility, are not ever permitted for their interfering with a man's obligation, only ever being permitted in life-threatening circumstances for the man such as some forms of cancer.  For example, a crushed or mangled man may not be permitted to marry anyone but a convert under Jewish law, and halachic authorities see [[vasectomy]] as a form of maiming, even if already married to a non-convert becoming maimed intentionally or accidentally including an vasectomy does obligate divorce unless a successful repair surgery is performed and sperm flow is returned (based on [[Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|23:2|HE}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aish.com/atr/Vasectomy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

When Orthodox Jewish couples contemplate the use of contraceptives, they generally consult a [[rabbi]] competent on this topic who evaluates the need for the intervention and which method is preferable from a ''[[halakha|halachic]]'' point of view.

The Midrash of Genesis speaks of the origins of oral contraceptives: "In the early time of creation, in the time of Lemech, a medicine was known, the taking of which prevented a woman's conception."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/mhl/mhl05.htm Genesis Rabba 23 p.56]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inasmuch as the strict letter of the law, as understood by classic authorities, does not obligate the fathering of limitless number of children beyond the requirement to produce at least one child of each gender or according to another opinion until two male offspring are born, there is wide latitude within halacha to limit family sizes, although usage of contraception varies from community to community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Contraception.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Modern Orthodox authorities are inclined to permit contraception for a broad array of reasons, with some arguing that a couple may decide to delay procreation even without specific rabbinic permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_view/gid,1398/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hormonal contraception==
Generally, the introduction of [[hormonal contraception]] in the 1960s did not cause the stir within [[Judaism|Jewish]] circles that it caused in other religious groups. A number of [[responsa]] from rabbinic decisors (''[[posek|poskim]]'') outlined the proper approach to the new phenomenon.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} There has been little talk of the potential risk of increased [[promiscuity]] (''z'nut'').{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

An innovative use of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] in Judaism is employed by some young brides. The laws of [[family purity]] prohibit sexual intercourse while a woman is menstruating (see ''[[niddah]]''). In order to decrease the chance of [[menstruation]] occurring just before (or on) the wedding night, some brides briefly regulate their periods in the months leading up to their [[wedding]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

[[File:Opperrabbijn Jacobs ondertekend.jpg|250px|thumb|Signing of the ketubah]]
[[File:Ketubah (4).jpg|thumb|200px|A decorated ketubah]]
A '''Jewish wedding''' is a [[wedding]] ceremony that follows Jewish laws and traditions.

While wedding ceremonies vary, common features of a Jewish wedding include a [[ketubah]] (marriage contract) which is signed by two witnesses, a [[Chuppah|wedding canopy]] (''chuppah'' or ''huppah''), a ring owned by the groom that is given to the bride under the canopy, and the [[#Breaking the glass|breaking of a glass]].

Technically, the Jewish wedding process has two distinct stages:&lt;ref name="JewEncMarCer"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=marriage ceremonies|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&amp;artid=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[erusin|kiddushin]]'' (sanctification or dedication, also called ''erusin'', [[betrothal]] in Hebrew) and ''nissuin'' (marriage), when the couple start their life together. The first stage prohibits the woman to all other men, requiring a religious divorce [[Get (divorce document)|(get)]] to dissolve, and the final stage permits the couple to each other. The ceremony that accomplishes nisuin is known as [[chuppah]].&lt;ref name="RKap18"&gt;Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Moznaim Publishing Company, New York / Jerusalem, 1983, Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, ''erusin/kiddushin'' occurs when the groom gives the bride a ring or other object of value with the intent of creating a marriage. There are differing opinions as to which part of the ceremony constitutes ''nissuin/chuppah''; they include standing under the canopy - itself called a ''chuppah'' - and being alone together in a room ([[yichud]]).&lt;ref name="RKap18"/&gt; While historically these two events could take place as much as a year apart,&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud Bavli]], Ketubot, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; they are now commonly combined into one ceremony.&lt;ref name="RKap18"/&gt;

== Signing of the marriage contract ==
Before the wedding ceremony, the chatan (groom) agrees to be bound by the terms of the ketubah, or marriage contract, in the presence of two witnesses, whereupon the witnesses sign the ketubah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishweddingnetwork.com/jewish-wedding-traditions|title=Jewish wedding traditions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ketubah details the obligations of the groom to the kallah (bride), among which are food, clothing, and marital relations. This document has the standing of a legally binding agreement. It is often written as an illuminated manuscript that is framed and displayed in their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohr.edu/1087|title=The Jewish Wedding Ceremony by Rabbi Mordechai Becher|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the chuppah, it is traditional to read the signed [[ketubah]] aloud, usually in the [[Aramaic]] original, but sometimes in translation. Traditionally, this is done to separate the two basic parts of the wedding.&lt;ref name="RKap21"&gt;Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Moznaim Publishing Company, New York / Jerusalem, 1983, Chapter 21&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Orthodox Jewish couples may opt for a bilingual ketubah, or for a shortened version to be read out.

== Bridal canopy ==
A traditional Jewish wedding ceremony takes place under a [[Chuppah]] or wedding canopy, symbolizing the new home being built by the couple when they become husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewish-wedding-planner.com/chuppah.html |title=Chuppah |publisher=Jewish-wedding-planner.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewpro.co.uk/Jewish/classifieds/Weddings-or-Parties/Jewish-Chuppah-in-London.html |title=View Chuppah listings and search for Simchas listings |publisher=Jewpro.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Covering of the bride ==
[[File:Marco MARCUOLA, Un mariage juif (titre attribué) Venise, vers 1780.jpg|thumb|''Jewish Wedding'', Venice, 1780 [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme]]]]
Prior to the ceremony, [[Ashkenazi Jews]] have a custom to cover the face of the bride (usually with a veil), and a prayer is often said for her based on the words spoken to Rebecca in Genesis 24:60.&lt;ref&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=Veil|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=36&amp;letter=V}} and [http://www.oztorah.com/2010/03/a-guide-to-the-marriage-ceremony/ A guide to the marriage ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt; The veiling ritual is known in [[Yiddish]] as ''[[badeken]]''. Various reasons are given for the veil and the ceremony, a commonly accepted reason is that it reminds the Jewish people of how Jacob was tricked by Laban into marrying Leah before Rachel, as her face was covered by her veil (see [[Vayetze (parsha)#Commandments|Vayetze]]).&lt;ref name="RKap17"&gt;Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Moznaim Publishing Company, New York / Jerusalem, 1983, Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sephardi Jews]] do not perform this ceremony.

== Unterfirers ==
In many Orthodox Jewish communities, the bride is  escorted to the [[chuppah]] by her father and mother &lt;ref name="Guideto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2010/03/a-guide-to-the-marriage-ceremony/|title=OzTorah  » Blog Archive   » A guide to the Jewish marriage ceremony|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; known by Ashkenazi Jews as ''unterfirers'' (Yiddish, lit. ones who lead under).

== Encircling the groom ==

[[File:Mazel Tov! wedding.jpg|thumb|200px|A groom breaking the glass]]

[[File:Исаак Аскназий Еврейская свадьба.jpg|thumb|220px|right|1893 painting of a marriage procession in a Russian [[shtetl]]&lt;br /&gt; by [[Isaak Asknaziy]]]]
The bride traditionally walks around the groom three or seven times when she arrives at the [[Chuppah]]. This may derive from [[Jeremiah 31#Verse 22|Jeremiah 31:22]], “A woman shall surround a man”. The three circuits may represent the three virtues of marriage: righteousness, justice and loving kindness (see Hosea 2:19). Seven circuits derives from the Biblical concept that seven denotes perfection or completeness.&lt;ref name="Guideto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2010/03/a-guide-to-the-marriage-ceremony/|title=OzTorah  » Blog Archive   » A guide to the Jewish marriage ceremony|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sephardic Jews do not perform this ceremony.&lt;ref name="RKap19"&gt;Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Moznaim Publishing Company, New York / Jerusalem, 1983, Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presentation of the ring (Betrothal) ==
In traditional weddings, two blessings are recited before the betrothal; a blessing over wine, and the ''betrothal blessing'', which is specified in the Talmud.&lt;ref&gt;Ketuboth 7b&lt;/ref&gt; The wine is then tasted by the couple.&lt;ref name="RKap20"&gt;Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Moznaim Publishing Company, New York / Jerusalem, 1983, Chapters 20 and 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The groom gives the bride a ring, traditionally a plain wedding band,&lt;ref name="RLamm15"&gt;The Jewish Way in Love &amp;amp; Marriage, Rabbi Maurice Lamm, Harper &amp;amp; Row, 1980, Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; and recites the declaration: ''Behold, you are consecrated to me with this ring according to the law of Moses and Israel''. The groom places the ring on the bride’s right index finger. According to traditional Jewish law, two valid witnesses must see him place the ring.&lt;ref name="RKap20" /&gt;

During some [[egalitarian]] weddings, the bride will also present a ring to the groom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_askrabbi_c/bl_weddingring.htm |title=Jewish Wedding Ring |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dovii|first1=Mane|title=מון|url=http://www.moon-events.co.il|accessdate=14 June 2016|work=מון אירועים, (מון סטון)|publisher=www.moon-events.co.il|date=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; often with a quote from the Song of Songs: "Ani l'dodi, ve dodi li" (I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine), which may also be inscribed on the ring itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marlena Thompson |url=http://jewishfederations.org/jewish-traditions/wedding-customs-old-new-and-renovated |title=Jewish Life Cycle/Rituals: Marriage |publisher=Jewishfederations.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbi-mercy.com/02Marriage.htm |title=Shalom!

The [[Sheva Brachot]] or seven blessings are recited by the [[hazzan]] or [[rabbi]], or by select guests who are called up individually. Being called upon to recite one of the seven blessings is considered an honour. The groom is given the cup of wine to drink from after the seven blessings. The bride also drinks the wine. In some traditions, the cup will be held to the lips of the groom by his new father-in-law and to the lips of the bride by her new mother-in-law.&lt;ref name="Jewish Weddings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beingjewish.com/cycle/wedding.html |title=The Jewish Wedding |publisher=Beingjewish.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions vary as to whether additional songs are sung before the seven blessings.

== Breaking the glass ==
After the bride has been given the ring, or at the end of the ceremony (depending on local custom), the groom breaks a glass, crushing it with his right foot, and the guests shout "{{rtl-lang|he|מזל טוב}}" ({{transl|he|[[mazel tov]]!}} 'congratulations'). At some contemporary weddings, a [[lightbulb]] may be substituted because it is thinner and more easily broken, and it makes a louder popping sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Get smashed… &amp; mazel tov |url=http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/article_508187f9-c9d8-5d20-84a5-1775f0d30e5a.html | publisher=Cleveland Jewish News |date=2011-10-05 |access-date=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of this custom is unknown, although many reasons have been given. The primary reason is that joy must always be tempered.&lt;ref name="RKap22"&gt;Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Moznaim Publishing Company, New York / Jerusalem, 1983, Chapters 20 and 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on two accounts in the Talmud of rabbis who, upon seeing that their son's wedding celebration was getting out of hand, broke a vessel – in the second case a glass – to calm things down. Another explanation is that it is a reminder that despite the joy, Jews still mourn the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Because of this, some recite the verses "If I forget thee / O Jerusalem..." (Ps. 137:5) at this point.&lt;ref name="RLamm15"/&gt; Many other reasons have been given by traditional authorities.&lt;ref name="RKap22"/&gt;

Former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel [[Ovadia Yosef]] has strongly criticized the way this custom is sometimes carried out, arguing that "Many unknowledgeable people fill their mouths with laughter during the breaking of the glass, shouting 'mazel tov' and turning a beautiful custom meant to express our sorrow" over Jerusalem's destruction "into an opportunity for lightheadedness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/135988 |title=Senior Israeli Rabbi Slams 'Breaking of the Glass" at Weddings |publisher=Israel National News |date=2010-02-13 |access-date=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reform Judaism has a new custom where brides and grooms break the wine glass together.

== Yichud ==
[[Yichud]] (Hebrew for "togetherness" or "seclusion") refers to the Ashkenazi practice of leaving the bride and groom alone for 10–20 minutes after the wedding ceremony. The couple retreats to a private room. Yichud can take place anywhere, from a rabbi's study to a synagogue classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/weddings/article/yichud_a_romantic_oasis_20070420/|title=Yichud—a romantic oasis - Weddings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for yichud is that according to several authorities, standing under the canopy alone does not constitute ''chuppah'', and seclusion is necessary to complete the wedding ceremony.&lt;ref name="RKap18"/&gt; However, Sephardic Jews do not have this custom, as they consider it a ''davar mechoar'', a "repugnant thing", compromising the couple's modesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/marriage.html |title=Marriage |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date=1996-11-08 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Yemen, the Jewish practice was not for the groom and his bride to be secluded in a canopy (''chuppah''), as is widely practiced today in Jewish weddings, but rather in a bridal chamber that was, in effect, a highly decorated room in the house of the groom. This room was traditionally decorated with large hanging sheets of colored, patterned cloth, replete with wall cushions and short-length mattresses for reclining.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafih]], ''Halikhot Teiman'' (Jewish Life in Sana) , Ben-Zvi Institute – Jerusalem 1982, pp. 143 and 148 (Hebrew); Yehuda Levi Nahum, ''Miṣefunot Yehudei Teman', Tel-Aviv 1962, p. 149 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage is consummated when they have been left together alone in this room. This ancient practice finds expression in the writings of [[Isaac ben Abba Mari]] (c. 1122 – c. 1193), author of ''Sefer ha-'Ittur'',&lt;ref&gt;Isaac ben Abba Mari, ''Sefer ha'Ittur'' - Part 1 (''sha'ar sheni''), Lwów, Ukraine 1860&lt;/ref&gt; concerning the Benediction of the Bridegroom: "Now the ''chuppah'' is when her father delivers her onto her husband, bringing her into that house wherein is some new innovation, such as the sheets… surrounding the walls, etc. For we recite in the Jerusalem Talmud, ''Sotah'' 46a (''Sotah'' 9:15), 'Those bridal chambers, (''chuppoth hathanim''), they hang within them patterned sheets and gold-embroidered ribbons,' etc."

== Special dances ==
Dancing is a major feature of Jewish weddings. It is customary for the guests to dance in front of the seated couple and entertain them.&lt;ref name="wedding.theknot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wedding.theknot.com/wedding-planning/wedding-reception-planning/articles/jewish-wedding-reception-rituals.aspx|title=Jewish Wedding Reception Rituals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Ashkenazi dances include:

*The ''Krenzl'', in which the bride's mother is crowned with a wreath of flowers as her daughters dance around her (traditionally at the wedding of the mother's last unwed daughter).
*The ''Mizinke'', a dance for the parents of the bride or groom when their last child is wed.
* The "[[Hora (dance)#Israeli Horah|Horah]]" is a Middle Eastern/Israeli style dance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livejewishmusic.com/JewishWeddingVideos.html|title=Jewish Wedding Music Videos|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually played as a second dance set.
*The ''gladdening of the bride'', in which guests dance around the bride, and can include the use of "shtick"—silly items such as signs, banners, costumes, confetti, and jump ropes made of table napkins.
*The [[Mitzvah tantz]], in which family members and honored rabbis are invited to dance in front of the bride (or sometimes with the bride in the case of a father or grandfather), often holding a ''[[gartel]]'', and then dancing with the groom. At the end the bride and groom dance together themselves.

== Birkat hamazon and sheva brachot ==
After the meal, [[Birkat Hamazon]] (Grace after meals) is recited, followed by [[sheva brachot]]. At a wedding banquet, the wording of the blessings preceding Birkat Hamazon is slightly different from the everyday version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.headcoverings-by-devorah.com/BirkatHaMazon_EncyclopediaJudaica.htm|title=Birkat HaMazon - Encyclopedia Judaica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer booklets called ''benchers,'' may be handed out to guests. After the prayers, the blessing over the wine is recited, with two glasses of wine poured together into a third, symbolising the creation of a new life together.&lt;ref name="wedding.theknot.com"/&gt;

== Jewish prenuptial agreements ==
{{unsourced-section|date=June 2016}}
In recent years, the governing bodies of several branches of Judaism have developed standard [[Jewish prenuptial agreement]]s designed to prevent a man from withholding a get (Jewish bill of divorce) from his wife, should she want one. Such documents have been developed and widely used in the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom and other places.

[[File:Jobert of Syria, by Laurent Cars.jpg|thumb|Jobert of Syria by Laurent Cars]]
'''Jobert of Syria''' (also known as Gilbert, Josberto, or Joubert) was the seventh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smom-za.org/grandmasters/07.htm|title=Joubert of Syria - 7th grandmaster of the Order of Malta (SMOM)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]] in Syria from 1172 to his death, which is thought &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memim.com/jobert-of-syria.html|title=Jobert of Syria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have occurred in 1177.

== Career ==

He succeeded [[Cast de Murols]] (1170–1172), while Cast's predecessor, [[Gilbert d'Aissailly]], who was still living, had been deposed. The memory of Gilbert must have informed Jobert of how not to waste the Order's funds, for he seems to have been a responsible steward of the order's assets. He set aside property for the production of white bread for the poor at the hospital in [[Jerusalem]].

In August 1174, he refused to commit, along with the other Orders, to aiding the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] Navy in attacking [[Egypt]] with [[Miles de Plancy]], the [[regent]] of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. In December he joined the new regent, [[Raymond III of Tripoli]], in a planned attack on Sultan [[Saladin]]. He and his forces were with the army that menaced [[Homs]] after [[Saladin]] had taken it. No battle was fought and the [[Franks]] left in exchange for the release of hostages and remission of ransoms.

In 1176, [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem]] confirmed a grant of lands in [[Egypt]] to the Order in exchange for assistance from Jobert in the planned campaign there. Though Jobert supported the Egyptian policy, he is last mentioned in January 1177, and his successor, [[Roger de Moulins]], did not agree with the plan, which was abandoned.

'''Khivi''' ({{lang-pa|ਮਾਤਾ ਖੀਵੀ}}) (1506–1582) also referred to as '''Mata Khivi''' or '''Bibi Khivi''' was the wife of [[Guru Angad Dev]], second Sikh guru.

==Early life==
Mata Khivi Ji was born in 1506 into a Marwaha Khatri family to Devi Chand and Karan Devi in village Sanghar near [[Amritsar]]. Devi Chand was a businessman and money lender. She was married to [[Guru Angad Dev Ji|Lehna]], a resident of Khadur in 1519 at the age of 13, who went on to become second guru of [[Sikhs]] and was named Guru Angad Dev. The couple had four children; two sons Datu and Dasu and two daughters Anokhi and [[Bibi Amro]]. According to some sources, couple had three children (omitting Anokhi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singha|first1=H.

She lived to the age of 75.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3619">A '''lilu''' or '''lilû''' is a masculine Akkadian word for a spirit, related to [[Alû]], demon.
It is disputed whether, if at all, the Akkadian word ''lilu'', or cognates, is related to the  Hebrew word ''[[lilith|liyliyth]]'' in Isaiah 34:14, which is thought to be a night bird by some modern scholars such as Judit M. Blair.&lt;ref&gt;Blair J. M. De-demonising the Old Testament: An Investigation of Azazel &lt;/ref&gt;  The Babylonian concept of lilu may be more strongly related to the later Talmudic concept of [[Lilith]] (female) and [[lilin]] (female).

In [[Akkadian literature]] lilu occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Deliver Me from Evil: Mesopotamian Incantations, 2500-1500 BC - Page 149 Graham Cunningham - 1997 "Partly or wholly bilingual incantations in the Old Babylonian period (continued)&lt;br&gt;Text 313: Geller 1989 text An, Malluhi, Directed against witchcraft PBS 1/2 122 b Enki, Utu Features divine dialogue" (partly bilingual) &lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sumerian literature]] lili occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Deliver Me from Evil: Mesopotamian Incantations, 2500-1500 BC - Page 177 Graham Cunningham - 1997 "This is particularly the case in Sumerian incantations, with only two of the daimons specified in Sumerian texts being mentioned in Akkadian incantations, Lamastu and to a lesser degree Ardat Lili. In contrast to the Sumerian attribution "&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sumerian king list]] the father of [[Gilgamesh]] is said to be a ''lilu''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The wicked [[Utukku]] who slays man alive on the plain.&lt;br /&gt;
          The wicked [[Alû]] who covers (man) like a garment.&lt;br /&gt;
          The wicked [[Etimmu]], the wicked [[Gallû]], who bind the body.&lt;br /&gt;
          The Lamme ([[Lamashtu]]), the [[Lammea]] ([[Labasu]]), who cause disease in the body.&lt;br /&gt;
          The Lilû who wanders in the plain.&lt;br /&gt;
          They have come nigh unto a suffering man on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;
          They have brought about a painful malady in his [[human body|body]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Stephen Herbert Langdon]] 1864&lt;ref&gt;Major-General Sir [[H. C. Rawlinson]].  ''Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia''.  Vol. 4 (Semitic). ed. [[Theophilus Pinches]].  [[London]]: [[British Museum]], 1861–64, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating of specific Akkadian, Sumerian and Babylonian texts mentioning ''lilu'' (masculine), ''lilitu'' (female) and ''lili'' (female) are haphazard. In older out-of-copyright sources, such as [[R. Campbell Thompson]]'s ''The Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia'' (1904) specific text references are rarely given. An exception is K156 which mentions an ''ardat lili''&lt;ref&gt;Thompson p.XXXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; Jo Ann Scurlock and Burton R. Andersen (2005) see the origin of ''lilu'' in treatment of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Diagnoses in Assyrian and Babylonian medicine: ancient sources 2005 Page 435 "The reason for the attribution of this disorder to the lilu was probably that the majority of patients developed characteristic symptoms in adolescence or early adulthood. This pattern of onset is characteristic of some mental disorders"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinrich Zimmern]] (1917) tentatively identified ''vardat lilitu'' KAT3, 459 as paramour of ''lilu''.&lt;ref&gt;Akkadische Fremdwörter als Beweis für babylonischen Kultureinfluß. Leipzig, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Aramaic Incantation Texts from Nippur - Page 76 James Alan Montgomery - 2011 "So in the Talmud they dwell in the beams and crevices, the cesspools, etc.,52 even as in Greek magic demons 45 Acc. to Zimmern, KAT3, 459 = paramour of lilu. Better Thompson. (Devils, etc., i, p. xxxvii, Semitic Magic, 65), who regards the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20950">This is a '''list of African Methodist Episcopal Churches''', covering local churches of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] and also local churches of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]], which is related.&lt;!--- Perhaps the AME Zion ones should be split to a different list-article (discuss at Talk).  We need to explicitly state both are being presented together, if they are, though. ---&gt;

The African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church was founded by [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1816, and split off African-American members from the white-dominated [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] denomination to make an independent denomination.  It is based in the United States but seven of its 20 districts are overseas, including in [[Liberia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Angola]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wms-amec.org/connections.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its [[Women's Missionary Service]], an [[NGO]], operates in 32 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wms-amec.org/about.html Women's Missionary Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

The African Methodist Episcopal Zion (AME Zion) church evolved as a division within the Methodist Episcopal Church denomination.  The first AME Zion church was founded in 1800.  Like the AME Church, the AME Zion Church sent missionaries to Africa in the first decade after the [[American Civil War]] and it also has a continuing overseas presence.

The AME and AME Zion churches are in full communion (along with the [[United Methodist Church]], the [[African Union Methodist Protestant Church]], the [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church]], and the [[Union American Methodist Episcopal Church]].&lt;!--- from the AME Zion wikipedia article---&gt;

Of these, ten lie within the medieval [[City wall of Visby|city walls]].&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Lagerlöf|editor1-first=Erland|last= Lagerlöf|first= Erland|authorlink= |title= Gotlands kyrkor|trans-title=Churches of Gotland|url= http://libris.kb.se/bib/7232718|year= 1973|publisher= [[Rabén &amp; Sjögren]]|location= Uddevalla|language=Swedish|isbn= 9129410355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three additional church ruins in Visby are known through written sources, but today completely vanished.&lt;ref name="DMG"&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrén|first= Anders|authorlink= |title= Det Medeltida Gotland.

Gotland began to gradually abandon [[Norse religion]] and adopt [[Christianity]] during the 11th century.&lt;ref name="DMG" /&gt; While the earliest [[church (building)|churches]] were wooden, construction of stone churches began during the 12th century. The church building period was fairly short; in the countryside stone churches were erected between the early 12th and mid-14th centuries,&lt;ref name="DMG" /&gt; while in Visby the last churches were inaugurated during the 15th century.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor" /&gt;

Some of these churches have since fallen into ruin. Of the 94 medieval parish churches in the countryside, 91 are still in use. Three were abandoned following the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], when parishes were merged, and some churches became superfluous.&lt;ref name="DMG" /&gt; There are in addition three chapel ruins, or ruins of small churches, in the countryside. There are also the ruins of two [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] abbeys, one in the countryside and one just outside the city wall of Visby.

Although the exact number of churches that existed in Visby during the [[Middle Ages]] is unknown, there were certainly more than in any other Swedish city, and at least twelve within the city walls.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor" /&gt;&lt;ref name=landskapsarv&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.landskapsarv.se/index.php?id=143|title= ÖDEKYRKOR – Gotland|trans-title=Church ruins – Gotland|editor-last1= Ulfsdotter|editor-first1= Linnea|last2= |first2= |date= |website=www.landskapsarv.se |publisher= Landskapsarv|language=Swedish|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visby grew to become an important trading port during the Middle Ages, and most of the churches in the city were built during the 12th and 13th centuries.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor" /&gt;&lt;ref name=landskapsarv /&gt; The churches were not, as in the countryside, only parish churches. Some belonged to abbeys, [[almshouse]]s or served groups of traders of a specific nationality, such as the Russian Church or present-day [[Visby Cathedral]], which was originally a church used by German traders.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor" /&gt;&lt;ref name=landskapsarv /&gt;

Following the [[Black Death]], the invasion of Gotland by [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]] and the [[Battle of Visby]] in 1361, and a general decrease in trade, Gotland entered a period of decline. From about 1361, building activity therefore dropped.&lt;ref name=landskapsarv /&gt; The inauguration of ''Sankta Karin'' in 1412 marks the end of church building activity in Visby.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor" /&gt; When troops from [[Free City of Lübeck|Lübeck]] pillaged the city in 1525, and probably damaged several of the churches, the social and economic rationale for sustaining them had vanished.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor" /&gt; With the advent of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] soon afterwards, the religious rationale to sustain the upkeep of the many churches also permanently disappeared. All monasteries were abolished and all churches within the city walls except one (present-day [[Visby Cathedral]]) were abandoned and left to decay. During the following centuries, some church ruins were used as [[quarry|quarries]]. In 1805 the church ruins were protected by law and in 1863 the Swedish state for the first time allocated money for their conservation.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor" /&gt;

According to tradition, the church was built in memory of Gunfjaun, the son of a local chieftain named Hafder. It is doubtful whether the church building ever was completed.&lt;ref name=ardre&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gotland.se/76561|title= Gunfjauns kapell, Ardre Ekese 1:18 Ardre ödekyrka|trans-title=Chapel of Gunfjauns, Ardre Ekese 1:18 Ardre Church ruin|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.gotland.se |publisher= [[Gotland Municipality|Region Gotland]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1588 the local population demanded that it should be re-opened and repaired. The parish was however merged with that of [[Hörsne Church]] and Bara Church left to decay. The church was built in the 13th century and shares some characteristics with [[Anga Church, Gotland|Anga Church]].&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor" /&gt;

They consists of an [[octagon]]al two-storeyed nave and a protruding choir. The church was erected during the 13th century. According to one theory, the church was built for Bishop [[Albert of Riga]], who is known to have been on Gotland in the early 13th century to gather crusaders and missionaries to go with him to [[Livonia]]. The church became the almshouse of Visby in 1532, but by the early 17th century was apparently in a ruinous state and used as a barn.&lt;ref name=visbykyrkor /&gt;

Even in its ruined state the abbey can be appreciated as a typical representative of [[Cistercian architecture]].&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor" /&gt;

Archaeological excavations carried out in 1971 revealed the foundations of a small church under the floor of a house on ''Södra kyrkogatan'' street. It may have been one of possibly two churches for Russian traders in Visby during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=visbykyrkor /&gt;

The convent was founded in 1233 and a first construction period took place {{circa}} 1235–1250. During the early 14th century reconstruction work on the church began, and was not finished until 1412, when the church was re-inaugurated. The abbey was disbanded during the 1520s, and the buildings were for a short while used as an almshouse before being completely abandoned.&lt;ref name=visbykyrkor /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slottsguiden.info/slottdetalj.asp?id=165 Slottsguiden, ''S:ta Karin, Sverige'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It was probably preceded by a smaller, 12th-century church. In its present state, it is still considered a typical representative of 13th-century Visby churches.&lt;ref name=visbykyrkor /&gt;
|-
|''Sankt Drotten''|| style="background:#ccccee;"|&lt;center&gt;'''Visby'''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;{{coord|57|38|30.33|N|18|17|42.72|E|type:landmark|name=Sankt Drotten Church Ruin}}&lt;/center&gt; || [[File:Ruine St.Drotten 2.jpg|150px]] || The church was dedicated to the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] but called '''Drotten''' after an old Norse word meaning Lord or King, i.e. referring to God. It is similar to Sankt Clemens but smaller and probably older. It seems to have been constructed mainly during the 13th and 14th centuries.&lt;ref name=visbykyrkor /&gt;
|-
|''Sankt Nicolaus''|| style="background:#ccccee;"|&lt;center&gt;'''Visby'''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;{{coord|57|38|38.83|N|18|17|53.02|E|type:landmark|name=Sankt Nicolaus Church Ruin}}&lt;/center&gt; || [[File:Ruined church (3875572734).jpg|150px]] || The church of '''Saint Nicholas''' was the abbey church of a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] abbey, founded before 1230. Its most famous [[prior]] was [[Petrus de Dacia (Swedish monk)|Petrus de Dacia]]. The church is possibly older than the abbey; the monks may have acquired an already existing church, or one under construction. Enlargement and reconstruction works were carried out until the late 14th century. The church and abbey were probably destroyed by troops from Lübeck in 1525.&lt;ref name=visbykyrkor /&gt;

It is the smallest of the former churches in Visby. An excavation carried out in 1935 determined that it dates from the second half of the 15th century.&lt;ref name=visbykyrkor /&gt;

It was originally tied to an almshouse for [[Leprosy|lepers]] nearby. The church is lacking in decorative elements and has therefore been difficult to date.&lt;ref name=visbykyrkor /&gt; The [[choir (architecture)|choir]] and [[nave (architecture)|nave]] probably date from different periods. The choir is the oldest, perhaps from the late 12th or early 13th century, and the nave may date from the 13th century.&lt;ref name=stgoran&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tuulse|first= Armin|last2= |first2= |date= 1970|title= S:t Görans kyrkoruin i Visby|url= http://kulturarvsdata.se/raa/fornvannen/html/1970_090|journal= Fornvännen|publisher= [[Swedish National Heritage Board|Riksantikvarieämbetet]]|volume= |language=Swedish, German|issue= |pages= 90–107|doi= |accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The almshouse was shut down in 1542,&lt;ref name=visbykyrkor /&gt; but the cemetery continued to be used occasionally, e.g. during an outbreak of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in 1711–12 and following an outbreak of [[cholera]] in the 1850s.&lt;ref name=stgoran /&gt;

Construction of the church began during the second quarter of the 13th century. It was built by local stonemasons but in an unusual, cross-shaped form. Inspiration for this form probably came from [[Byzantine architecture]] and may have reached Gotland following the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|siege of Constantinople in 1204]].&lt;ref name=visbykyrkor /&gt;

The church dedicated to Saint Peter is the older, probably from the middle of the 12th century. It was successively rebuilt and enlarged. The history of Saint Hans is opaque, but it was built as a [[basilica]]. During excavations, two [[runestone]]s and a [[picture stone]] have been found among the ruins, pointing to a possibly even older, pagan sacred site. Both churches have in later centuries been used as quarries for limestone.&lt;ref name=visbykyrkor /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slottsguiden.info/slottdetalj.asp?id=169 Slottsguiden, ''S:t Per och S:t Hans, Sverige'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns''''' is a 2011 book by [[Christine Gardner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns|author=Christine J.

The '''Messianic Jewish Alliance of America''' ('''MJAA''') was founded in 1915 as the [[Hebrew Christian movement|Hebrew Christian Alliance of America]], changing its name in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ziw73-alUrMC&amp;pg=PA100|title=The Challenges of the Pentecostal, Charismatic and Messianic Jewish Movements|first= Peter|last=Hocken|work=books.google.co.uk |year=2009|ISBN=978-0-7546-6746-9|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows on from the International Hebrew Christian Alliance between the [[Hebrew Christian Alliance of Great Britain]] and that of America.

==History==
The Hebrew Christian Alliance of America began in the early 19th century as a mission by Hebrew Christians to other Jews. Various independent efforts were united at the Hebrew Christian Alliance of the United States in 1905, in partnership with Hebrew Christian Alliances of other countries, most notably the [[Hebrew Christian Alliance of Great Britain]] founded by Rev. [[Carl Schwartz]] 1866. The organization was under the sponsorship of Rev. Philip Milledoler of the Reformed Dutch Church.  Their efforts led to the formation in December 1816 of the first American Christian mission to Jews, which was incorporated on April 14, 1820 as the American Society for Meliorating the Condition of the Jews.  There were, however, few Jews in the US at the time, and the organization was run by Christian leaders of a variety of denominations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1487">'''Moses Davies''' (1799 – 6 January 1866) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] musician and composer. He was born in [[Defynnog]], [[Brecknockshire]] (now in [[Powys]]), but in 1803 his parents moved to [[Merthyr Tydfil]], where he grew up. He was an able singer and took to studying, and later teaching, music. In 1827 he was appointed precentor of the [[Calvinistic Methodist]] chapel in [[Pontmorlais]]. He was a pioneer of music in  [[congregational church]]es in the Merthyr area and his innovative ideas saw women being used to sing treble parts. This provoked much opposition, and he resigned his post. However, in 1834 he was persuaded to resume his position and, except for a period in [[London]] (from 1842 to 1848), he remained in the post until retirement.

His compositions include 24 hymn-tunes, which were included in ''Caniadau Seion'' (R. Mills, 1840), ''Telyn Seion'' (R. Beynon) and ''Haleliwia'' (Griffith Harries).

He died in January 1866 and was buried in [[Cefn-coed-y-cymmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moses Davies|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-DAVI-MOS-1799.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|last=Williams|first=Griffith John|accessdate= 1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nagarparkar'''  ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''نگرپاركر'''}}}}, {{lang-sd|'''ننگرپارڪر'''}}), is a town in at the base of the [[Karoonjhar Mountains]] in [[Tharparkar District]] in [[Sindh]] province of [[Pakistan]] that is known for the [[Nagarparkar Temples]] - a pilgrimage site for [[Hindu]]s and [[Jain]]s. Located at a distance of 129&amp;nbsp;km from [[Mithi]], in [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]].

==Description==
[[File:Jain_Temple_Nagarparkar_by_smn121-15.JPG|thumb|left|An ancient Jain temple at Nagarparkar]]
The town name comes from the original word ''Nangar Parkar''. It is at the foot of the [[Karoonjhar Mountains|Karoonjhar Hills]]. It is situated at a distance of about 16&amp;nbsp;km from south and about 23 from east from the [[India]]n border. At one time the area was under the sea, which had to be crossed; the name "Parkar" means "to cross over". Nagarparkar has [[Taluka]] [[Chachro]] on its north, and on its west is [[Taluka]] [[Mithi]] of [[Tharparkar District]], while on east of it lies [[Barmer district|Barmer]] ([[Rajasthan]]) and on its south is Rann Kachchh. The area surrounding the city is a rocky belt called Parkar, and the remaining part is a sandy area.

The [[Karoonjhar Mountains|Karoonjhar hills]] surround Nagarparkar for 16 miles. The [[granite]] stone of this mountain is used for making tiles. There is a saying that the Karoonjhar hills provide 1-1/4 kilos of [[gold]] every day in the form of red granite stone, china clay, and honey. In summer, different sounds are audible from the rock due to sulphur deposits.

This area has been leased by the government for the mining by dynamite blasting of the hills on which the temples are located. This is posing a threat to the temples. Angry pilgrims held a protest against mining.&lt;ref name=trib1&gt;[https://tribune.com.pk/story/130210/contractor-blasting-through-tharparkar-temple-in-search-of-granite/ Contractor blasting through Tharparkar temple in search of granite ], [[The Express Tribune]], 10 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nezha''' (哪吒) is a protection deity in [[Chinese folk religion]]. His official [[Taoism|Taoist]] name is "Marshal of the Central Altar" ({{lang|zh-Hant|中壇元帥}}). He was then given the title "Third Lotus Prince" ({{lang|zh-Hant|蓮花三太子}}) after he became a deity.

==Origins==
[[File:Krishna Janmashtami.jpg|200px|thumb|An image of [[Bala Krishna|baby Krishna]] displayed during [[Janmashtami]]  celebrations.]]
[[File:Templo Na Tcha, Macao, 2013-08-08, DD 01.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Na Tcha Temple of the Centre of Macau]], a Nezha temple behind the [[Ruins of St. Paul]], in [[Macau]].]]

According to [[Meir Shahar]], Nezha is ultimately based on two figures from [[Hindu mythology]]. The first is a [[yaksha]] from the ''[[Ramayana]]'' named [[Nalakuvara|Nalakubar]], the son of Yaksha King [[Kubera]] and nephew of the antagonist [[Ravana]]. The link to Nalakubar is established through variants in his Chinese name appearing in Buddhist sutras. The original variant Naluojiupoluo ({{lang|zh-Hant|那羅鳩婆羅}}) changed to Naluojubaluo ({{lang|zh-Hant|捺羅俱跋羅}}), Nazhajuwaluo ({{lang|zh-Hant|那吒矩韈囉}}), and finally Nazha ({{lang|zh-Hant|那吒}}). The simple addition of the "[[Radical 30|mouth radical]]" ({{lang|zh-Hant|口}}) to Na ({{lang|zh-Hant|那}}) changes the name to the current form Nezha ({{lang|zh-Hant|哪吒}}). The second figure is the child god [[Krishna]]. Both Krishna and Nezha are powerful children that defeat mighty serpents, [[Kaliya]] in the case of the former and [[Ao Bing]] in the latter. The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' describes how Nalakubar was rescued from imprisonment within a tree by Krishna. A 10th-century Tantric Buddhist sutra mentions a child god that seems to be an amalgam of Krishna and Nalakubar called Nana ({{lang|zh-Hant|那拏}}). In addition, Nalakubar’s father Kubera was eventually absorbed into the Buddhist pantheon as the Heavenly King [[Vaiśravaṇa]]. Shahar notes that Vaisravana was somehow connected to the historical Tang Dynasty general [[Li Jing (Tang dynasty)|Li Jing]]. This explains the name and position of Nezha’s father, the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King [[Li Jing (deity)|Li Jing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asia.haifa.ac.il/pdf/dep-seminar-meir-sahar.pdf |title=Nezha's connections to India Deities |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005333/http://asia.haifa.ac.il/pdf/dep-seminar-meir-sahar.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'', Nezha was born during the [[Shang dynasty]] in a military fortress at Chentang Pass. His father was a military commander named [[Li Jing (deity)|Li Jing]], who later became the "Pagoda-wielding Heavenly King". Nezha's mother, [[Lady Yin]], gave birth to a ball of flesh after being pregnant with him for three years and six months. Li Jing thought that his wife had given birth to a demon and attacked the ball with his sword. The ball split open and Nezha jumped out as a boy instead of an infant. Nezha could speak and walk immediately after birth. He was later accepted by the immortal [[Taiyi Zhenren]] as a student. He had two older brothers, [[Jinzha]], a disciple of [[Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun]], and [[Muzha (deity)|Muzha]].

One day, the people of Chentang Pass asked for rain, and sacrificed much food to the East Sea Dragon King [[Ao Guang]]. The King rejected the food, instead wanting girls and boys to eat. He sent Ye Sha to capture for him a girl and boy. Nezha and two other children were playing by the sea when Ye Sha appeared and captured one of Nezha's friends. Nezha then fought him and injured him severely, causing him to return to the King and beg for someone else to take care of Nezha. The Dragon King sent [[Ao Bing]], his third son, but the latter was slain by Nezha. Ao Guang called for his brothers and confronted Nezha and his family. He threatened to flood Chentang Pass and report Nezha to the [[Jade Emperor]]. To save his family and the people, Nezha committed suicide himself then carving up his own flesh and dismembering his bones "returning" these to his parents in repayment for the debt of his birth. The Dragon Kings then hosted a huge celebration.

After Nezha had committed suicide to return his body to his parents, he appeared in his mother's dream. In the dream, he asked her to build a temple for him, so that his soul would have a place to rest. This constitutes a link to Nezha's birth because the night before Nezha was born, Lady Yin had a dream where a Taoist put something into her bosom and told her to take this child. For both incidences, a dream was used to communicate a message.

His mother then secretly built a temple for Nezha and this temple later flourished. This temple became very well known and grew vastly because Nezha granted miracle cures to the sick and the crippled. However, Li Jing soon found out about this temple and burnt it down because he was still angry at Nezha and felt that he had already caused too much trouble for their family.

Li Jing burning the temple caused Nezha to desire his father's death. Thus, enmity between father and son grew. Nezha was later brought back to life by his teacher, Taiyi Zhenren, who used lotus roots to construct a human body for his soul and gave him two new weapons: the Wind Fire Wheels ({{lang|zh-Hant|風火輪}}) and the Fire-tipped Spear ({{lang|zh-Hant|火尖槍}}). With the reincarnation of Nezha by his master, Li Jing and Nezha fought many battles. However, Li Jing soon realized that his mortal body was no match for Nezha and so he ran for his life. On the run, he met his second son, Muzha, who fought and was defeated by Nezha. At this, Li Jing tried to commit suicide but was saved by [[Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun]], who also contained Nezha. In the end, Nezha was forced to submit to his father by another deity, [[Randeng Daoren]].

Nezha is often depicted as a youth, instead of an adult. He is often shown flying in the sky riding on the Wind Fire Wheels ({{lang|zh-Hant|風火輪}}), has the Universe Ring ({{lang|zh-Hant|乾坤圈}}) around his body (sometimes in his left hand), the Red Armillary Sash ({{lang|zh-Hant|浑天绫}}) around his shoulders and a Fire-tipped Spear ({{lang|zh-Hant|火尖槍}}) in his right hand. Sometimes, he is shown in his "three heads and six arms" form ({{lang|zh-Hant|三頭六臂}}). He has the ability to spit rainbows in some legends.

==In mythology and literature==
Nezha has frequently appeared in [[Chinese mythology]] and ancient [[Chinese literature]] such as ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' (or ''Investiture of the Gods''), although the story of ''Nezha conquering the sea'' is the most well known among Chinese households.

In ''[[Journey to the West]]'', Nezha was a general under his father, "Pagoda-wielding Heavenly King" Li Jing. He fought the Monkey King, [[Sun Wukong]], when the latter rebelled against the [[Jade Emperor]]. They became friends later.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdweinmann.tripod.com/glossary.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Nezha made some appearances in the novel to help the four protagonists defeat powerful demons including his adoptive sister  - Lady Earth Flow.

==Nezha in other media==
[[File:Nezha_Conquers_the_Dragon_King_Google_Doodle.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Nezha as a Google Doodle on Google Hong Kong.]]

Nezha increased in popularity in 1979 with the film ''[[Nezha Conquers the Dragon King]]'' ([[1979 in film|1979]]), which was screened at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]]. On 30 May 2014, [[Google]] paid homage to the film with an animated [[Google Doodle|doodle]] on their Hong Kong search engine's homepage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=35th Anniversary of Nezha Conquers the Dragon King|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/35th-anniversary-of-nezha-conquers-the-dragon-king|work=Google Doodle Archive|publisher=Google Inc.|accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nezha appears as an antagonist in the Chinese animated film ''[[Havoc in Heaven]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]; [[1964 in film|1964]]), losing a fight to [[Sun Wukong]].

Nezha appears as two of the playable characters in [[Koei]]'s ''[[Warriors Orochi 3]]''.  Nezha first appears as an arrogant Mystic general, brought back to life as a cyborg (rather than out of lotus roots) whose weapons are levitating discs or wheels.  Traveling back in time, the player encounters the more human-looking confident youth Nezha, who wields a fire-tipped spear.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Ne Zha is a playable character in the [[multiplayer online battle arena]] video game ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'', where he is a melee assassin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ne Zha: The Third Lotus Prince |url=http://www.smitegame.com/gods/ne-zha/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2015, Third Person Shooter Action game ''[[Warframe]]'' released a playable character named and themed after Nezha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warframe: Ring of Fire Update is now live! |url=https://www.warframe.com/news/ring-fire-update-now-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nezha is also a collectible character in [[Netmarble Games|Netmarble's]] mobile RPG ''Seven Knights'' where the character is actually female but still retains much of Nezha's mythos and characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nezha |url=http://www.mobirum.com/encyclopedia/contents/detail?id=2584&amp;cafeId=sevenknights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nezha is also playable character in the [[multiplayer online battle arena]] mobile game ''[[hero's evolved]]'', ( as a girl ) where she is a melee fighter.

A 2017 announcement from the leadership of [[Hasbro]] confirmed that Nezha will appear in a crossover with the ''[[Transformers]]'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=中美合拍动画片《哪吒与变形金刚》进入实质阶段 |url=http://www.cctv.cn/2017/07/06/ARTIzRTXb7yA9uwvL4tu6D4e170706.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nezha appears as a recurring demon and Persona in various games of [[Megami Tensei]] franchise, under the names Nataku or Nata Taishi.

Nezha appears in [[Fate/Grand Order]] as a gender-bend Lancer class Servant.

Nezha is one of the inspirations for Chiaotzu in the popular manga series [[Dragon Ball]].

Nezha is one of the many characters used in battle in the game Monster Super League, MSL, where he is actually portrayed as a girl rather than a boy.
He has 5 types, grass, water, fire, light and dark. Fire being represented as his original form.

The 1992 film [[Rebels of the Neon God]] by [[Tsai Ming-liang]] references Nezha.

==Religion==
Nezha is worshipped in [[Chinese folk religion]] and is called "Marshal of the Central Altar" or "Prince Nezha", the "Third Prince".

As in traditional folklore, Nezha flies around swiftly on his wind fire wheels, so he is also regarded as the tutelary god of many professional drivers, like trucks, taxis, or sightseeing bus drivers. They tend to place a small statue of Nezha in the vehicles for a safe drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwaninsights.com/tag/nezha-the-third-prince/|title=Associated News|author=|date=|website=Associated News|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also said Nezha is the patron of gamblers - mischievous enough to give winning numbers to lottery winners.

The Xinying Prince's Temple in [[Tainan]], built in 1728, is the founding temple of the cult in Taiwan.

Taiwan's [[Techno Prince Nezha]] dance groups were invited to perform in the opening ceremonies of the [[World Games 2009]] in [[Kaohsiung]] and the [[2009 Summer Deaflympics]] in [[Taipei]], presenting a fusion of popular culture and Chinese traditional art.

Nezha is a well-known Taoist deity in Japan. The Japanese refer to Nezha as ''Nataku'' or ''Nata'', which came from the readings of Xiyouji or Seiyuki (西遊記) in Japanese.

}}'''Parkindo''' ({{lang-id|Partai Kristen Indonesia}}, Indonesian Christian Party) was a political party in [[Indonesia]] from 1950 to 1973.
Founded by Johannes Leimena and Melanchton Siregar, the former Military Governor of North Sumatra, who has known as a local teacher in Tarutung. Its support was concentrated in [[Protestant]] areas of Indonesia. It had considerable influence despite the small number of Christians in Indonesia due to the large numbers of Christians in the civil service, the [[Indonesian Army|Army]] and educational establishments and because of the high profile of party leader [[Johannes Leimena]] who served in several [[cabinet of Indonesia|Indonesian cabinets]] and as deputy prime minister.&lt;ref name="FEITH_145"&gt;Feith (2007) p145&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Indonesian legislative election, 1955|1955 Indonesian legislative election]], the party won 2.6% of the vote and eight seats in the [[People's Representative Council]].&lt;ref name="FEITH_434"&gt;Feith (2007) p434&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[Indonesian legislative election, 1971|1971 elections]], the last it contested before being merged into the [[Indonesian Democratic Party]], it gained only 1.34% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Evans2021"&gt;Evans (2003) pp. 21-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liddle46"&gt;Liddle (1994) p46&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ranabir Singh Thapa''' ({{lang-ne|रणवीर सिंह थापा}}) also spelled '''Ranbir''', '''Ranavir''' or '''Ranvir''' also known by the late ascetic name '''Swami Abhayananda''' ({{lang-ne|स्वामी अभयानन्द}}) was a Nepalese Army General, prominent politician and minister of state. In 1837, he became Acting [[Mukhtiyar]] (equivalent to Prime Minister) of Nepal for a brief period. He was a prominent member of [[Thapa dynasty]]. He later turned ascetic and was known by the [[Sanyasi]] name Swami Abhayananda.
==Early Life==
{{main|Thapa dynasty}}
Ranabir Singh was born as the youngest son of [[Amar Singh Thapa (born 1759)|''Sanukaji'' Amar Singh Thapa]] and Satyarupa Maya.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=22-23}} He was the brother of [[Mukhtiyar]] [[Bhimsen Thapa]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=23}}

==Life as politician and military officer==
He was the Commander of the Makwanpur-Hariharpur axis during [[Anglo-Nepalese war]].&lt;ref name="nepalarmy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=two|publisher=nepalarmy.mil.np|title=Nepalese Army &amp;#124; नेपाली सेना|accessdate=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871 BS (1814 AD) he was deputed to Makwanpur to command the troops. He was leading 4000 soldiers against Major General Marley and Major General Woods. They were lured to major killing area by Ranabir Singh but Major-General Woods did not advance from Bara Gadhi.
&lt;ref name="nepalarmy"/&gt; After the war he became the administrator of Palpa and the general of Kalibash and Sabuj battalion.
[[File:Ranabir Singh Thapa letter.gif|thumb|Outer cover of letter sent by General Ranabir Singh Thapa signed by his private black seal to PM Bhimsen Thapa and Kazi [[Ranadhoj Thapa]] in Kantipur (Kathmandu)&lt;ref name ="bilder"&gt;http://www.bilder-aus-nepal.de/Pages/Philatelie/Thapa-Brief/Thapa-Brief-1835.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]
He was appointed chief member at the Royal Palace to keep observation on the King and Queen.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=148}}&lt;ref name ="bilder"/&gt; After the death of [[Queen Tripurasundari of Nepal]], the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went into the hands of the senior queen [[Samrajya Lakshmi Devi]], who knew all too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=149}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=156}} Sensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the ''[[Mukhtiyar]]'' himself.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=149}} There was a quarrel between [[Mathabar Singh Thapa]] and Ranabir Singh regarding the latter's loyalty shift towards the senior Queen Samrajya Lakshmi resulting in Mathabar resigning from the commandership of Sri Nath Regiment.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=147}} Getting a whiff of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=149–150}} However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=151}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=148}} King Rajendra supported Bhimsen instead of Ranabir Singh and the removal of Ranabir Singh sabotaged the Queen's plan.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=148}} 

In April 1835, Bhimsen also hatched a plan to make a state visit to Britain, hoping to force Britain to acknowledge the sovereignty of Nepal; but since he could not make the visit himself, his nephew Colonel Mathabar Singh Thapa was chosen as the representative of Nepal, bearing a few gifts and a letter from King Rajendra addressed to King William IV.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=104}}{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=18}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=152–153}} In this process, Ranbir Singh, the governor of Palpa, was made Full General beside the promotion of Mathabar Singh Thapa and Sher Jung Thapa.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=152–153}} After the annual muster at the beginning of 1837, an investigation was also started to check Bhimsen's expenditures in establishing various battalions.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=156}} Such events led the courtiers to feel that Bhimsen's ''Mukhtiyari'' would not last very long; thus Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the hopes of becoming the next ''[[Mukhtiyar]]'', wrote a letter to the King asking him to be recalled to Kathmandu from Palpa. His wish was granted; and Bhimsen, pleased to see his brother after many years, made Ranbir Singh the acting ''Mukhtiyar'' and decided to go to his ancestral home in Borlang Gorkha for the sake of pilgrimage.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=157}} On 24 July 1837, Rajendra's youngest son, Devendra Bikram Shah, an infant of six months, died suddenly.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=158}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=105}} It was at once rumored that the child had died of poison intended for his mother the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi Devi: given at the instigation of Bhimsen, or someone of his party.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=159}}{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|pp=28–29}} On this charge, Bhimsen, his brother Ranbir Singh, his nephew Mathbar Singh, their families, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay, and his deputy Bhajuman Baidya, with a few more of the nearest relatives of the Thapas were incarcerated, proclaimed outcasts, and their properties confiscated.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=159}}{{sfn|Acharya|1971|p=13}}{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=310}} 

==Release and ascetic life==
Fearful that the Pandes would re-establish their power, [[Fateh Jung Shah|Fatte Jang Shah]], Ranganath Poudel, and the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi Devi obtained from the King the liberation of Bhimsen, Mathabar, and the rest of the party, about eight months after they were incarcerated for the poisoning case.{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=311}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=109}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=161}} Sensing that a catastrophe was going to befall the Thapas, Mathabar Singh fled to India while pretending to go on a hunting trip; Ranbir Singh gave up all his property and became a [[sannyas|sanyasi]], titling himself Abhayanand Puri; but Bhimsen Thapa preferred to remain in his old home in Gorkha.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=161}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=110}} He was rendered by the following full name in his ascetic life '''Shreemant Paramahamsa Paribrajakacharya Swami Abhayananda Giri Nepali'''.

Before the European colonization, [[Native American religion|Aboriginal religions]] were largely [[animist]]ic or [[shamanist]]ic, including an intense tribal reverence for [[spirit]]s and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Native North American Religious Traditions: Dancing for Life – Page 5, Jordan D.

[[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]] brought waves of [[Anglicans]] and other [[Protestants]] to [[Upper Canada]], now [[Ontario]]. The [[Russian Empire]] spread [[Orthodox Christianity]] in a small extent to the tribes in the far north and western coasts, particularly hyperborean nomadics like the [[Inuit]]; Orthodoxy would arrive to the mainland with immigrants from the [[Soviet Union]], [[Eastern Bloc]], [[Greece]] and elsewhere during the 20th century.

There was an ongoing battle in the late 20th century to have religious garb accepted throughout Canadian society, mostly focused on [[Sikh]] [[turban]]s. The Canadian Armed Forces authorized the wearing of turban in 1986, eventually the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] followed in 1988 and eventually other federal government agencies accepted members wearing turbans.

==Census results==
In the [[Canada 2011 National Household Survey]] (the 2011 census did not ask about religious affiliation but the survey sent to a subset of the population did), 67% of the Canadian population list [[Roman Catholicism]] or [[Protestantism]] or another [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denomination]] as their religion, considerably less than 10 years before in the [[Canada 2001 Census]], where 77% of the population listed a Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo30c-eng.htm |title=Summary Tables |publisher=0.statcan.gc.ca |accessdate=October 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205182419/http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo30c-eng.htm |archivedate=February 5, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there have been substantial rises in non-Christian religions in Canada. From the 1991 to 2011, [[Islam]] grew by 316%, [[Hinduism]] 217%, [[Sikhism]] 209%, and [[Buddhism]] 124%. The growth of non-Christian religions expressed as a percentage of Canada's population rose from 4% in 1991 to 8% in 2011. In terms of the ratio of non-Christians to Christians, it rose from 21 Christians (95% of religious population) to 1 non-Christian (5% of religious population) in 1991 to 8 Christians (89%) to 1 non-Christian (11%) in 2011, a rise of 135% of the ratio of non-Christians to Christians, or a decline of 6.5% of Christians to non-Christians, in 20 years.

The [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 acknowledged the rights of the Roman Catholic Church throughout [[Lower Canada]] in order to keep the [[French Canadian]]s loyal to [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Britannic Crown]].&lt;ref name="LippyWilliams2010n"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles H Lippy|author2=Peter W Williams|title=Encyclopedia of Religion in America|volume=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BN7wAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT408|year=2010|publisher=Granite Hill Publishers|isbn=978-0-87289-580-5|page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholicism is still the main religion of French Canadians today.

[[File:St Pauls, Halifax.JPG|thumb|[[St. Paul's Church (Halifax)|St. Paul's Church]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], the oldest [[Anglican]] church in Canada still standing, built in 1750.]]
The [[American Revolution]] beginning in 1765 brought a large influx of Protestants to Canada when [[United Empire Loyalists]], fleeing the rebellious [[United States]], moved in large numbers to Upper Canada and the Maritimes.&lt;ref name="Press2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oxford University Press|title=Protestantism: Oxford Bibliographies Online Research Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_ZwQwK7c7wC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-980853-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They comprised a mix of Christian groups with a large number of [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglicans]], but also many [[Presbyterians]] and [[Methodists]].

===1800s to 1900s===
While [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] consolidated their hold on the upper classes, workingmen and farmers responded to the [[Methodism|Methodist revivals]], often sponsored by visiting preachers from the [[United States]]. Typical was Rev. [[James Caughey]], an American sent by the [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan Methodist Church]] from the 1840s through 1864. He brought in the converts by the score, most notably in the revivals in Western Canada from 1851 to 1853. His technique combined restrained emotionalism with a clear call for personal commitment, coupled with follow-up action to organize support from converts. It was a time when the [[holiness movement]] caught fire, with the revitalized interest of men and women in [[Christian perfection]]. Caughey successfully bridged the gap between the style of earlier camp meetings and the needs of more sophisticated Methodist congregations in the emerging cities.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bush, "The Reverend James Caughey and Wesleyan Methodist Revivalism in Canada West, 1851–1856," ''Ontario History,'' Sept 1987, Vol. 79 Issue 3, pp 231–250&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early nineteenth century in the [[The Maritimes|Maritimes]] and [[Upper Canada]], the [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican Church]] held the same official position it did in [[England]]. This caused tension within [[English Canada]], as much of the populace was not Anglican. Increasing immigration from [[Scotland]] created a very large [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] community and they and other groups demanded equal rights. This was an important cause of the [[1837 Rebellion in Upper Canada]]. With the arrival of [[Responsible government#Canada|responsible governments]], the Anglican monopoly was ended.&lt;ref name="ScobieRawlyk1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles H.H.

In [[Lower Canada]], the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] was officially pre-eminent and had a central role in the colony's culture and politics. Unlike English Canada, [[French Canadian]] [[Quebec nationalism|nationalism]] became very closely associated with Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref name="georgetown2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/canada |title=Canada |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=December 12, 2011}} See drop-down essay on "Early European Settlement and the Formation of the Modern State"&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the Roman Catholic Church in the region became one of the most reactionary in the world. Known as [[Ultramontane]] Catholicism, the church adopted positions condemning all manifestations of [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name="Lahey2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. Lahey|title=The First Thousand Years: A Brief History of the Catholic Church in Canada|year=2002|publisher=Novalis Publishing|isbn=978-2-89507-235-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In politics, those aligned with the Roman Catholic clergy in [[Quebec]] were known as ''[[parti bleu|les bleus]]'' (the blues). They formed a curious alliance with the staunchly monarchist and pro-British Anglicans of English Canada (often members of the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]) to form the basis of the Canadian [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]]. The [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]], which later became the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]], was largely composed of the anti-clerical French Canadians, known as ''[[parti rouge|les rouges]]'' (the reds) and the non-Anglican [[Protestantism|Protestant]] groups. In those times, right before elections, parish priests would give sermons to their flock where they said things like ''Le ciel est bleu et l'enfer est rouge'' ("Heaven/the sky is blue and hell is red").

In 1871, national census revealed 56.45% as Protestants, 42.80% as Roman Catholic, 0.05% as Pagans, 0.03% as Jewish, 0.02% as Mormons, 0.15% as irreligious and 0.49% as unspecified.&lt;ref&gt;https://www66.statcan.gc.ca/eng/1922-23/192202030163_p.%20163.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late nineteenth century, Protestant pluralism had taken hold in English Canada. While much of the elite were still Anglican, other groups, including the Methodists, had become very prominent as well. The schools and universities created at this time reflected this pluralism with major centres of learning being established for each faith. One, King's College, later the [[University of Toronto]], was set up as a non-denominational school. The influence of the Orange Order was strong, especially among [[Protestantism in Ireland|Irish Protestant]] immigrants, and comprised a powerful anti-Catholic force in [[Ontario]] politics; its influence faded away after 1920.&lt;ref name="HoustonSmyth1980"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cecil J. Houston|author2=William J. Smyth|title=The sash Canada wore: a historical geography of the Orange Order in Canada|year=1980|publisher=University of Toronto Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late nineteenth century also saw the beginning of a large shift in Canadian immigration patterns. Large numbers of [[Irish Canadians|Irish]] and [[Southern Europe]]an immigrants were creating new Roman Catholic communities in English Canada. Western Canada saw the arrival of significant [[Eastern Orthodox]] immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]] as well as [[Mormon]] and [[Pentecostal]] immigrants from the United States and [[Ireland]].

In 1919–20 Canada's five major [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Baptism|Baptist]], [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Methodism|Methodist]], and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]) cooperatively undertook the "Forward Movement." The goal was to raise funds and to strengthen [[Christianity|Christian spirituality]] in Canada. The movement invoked [[English language|Anglophone]] nationalism by linking donations with the [[Canada Savings Bond#World War I|Victory Loan campaigns]] of the [[First World War]], and stressed the need for funds to [[Culture of Canada|Canadianize]] immigrants. Centred in [[Ontario]], the campaign was a clear financial success, raising over $11&amp;nbsp;million. However the campaign exposed deep divisions among Protestants, with the traditional [[Evangelism|Evangelists]] speaking of a personal relationship with [[God]] and the more liberal denominations emphasizing the [[Social Gospel]] and [[good works]].&lt;ref&gt;Daryl Baswick, "Social Evangelism, the Canadian Churches, and the Forward Movement, 1919–1920," ''Ontario History'' vol 12#1 1997, pp 303–319&lt;/ref&gt; Both factions (apart from the Anglicans) agreed on prohibition, which was demanded by the [[WCTU]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Anne Cook, "'Earnest Christian Women, Bent on Saving our Canadian Youth': The Ontario Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Scientific Temperance Instruction, 1881–1930," ''Ontario History,'' Sept 1994, Vol. 86 Issue 3, pp 249–267&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1931, Roman Catholics were the largest religious body in Canada, with 4 million people. Following it were the United Church of Canada (including Methodists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians), with 2&amp;nbsp;million; the Anglican Church, with nearly 2&amp;nbsp;million; and the Presbyterian Church, with approximately 870,000. The Canada Year Book 1936 reported that "of the non-Christian sects, 155,614 or 1.50% were Jews, 24,087 or 0.23% were Confucians, 15,784 or 0.15% were Buddhists and 5,008 or 0.05% were pagans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www65.statcan.gc.ca/acyb07/acyb07_0009-eng.htm|title=Canada Year Book (CYB) Historical Collection|first=Statistics|last=Canada|website=www65.statcan.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domination of Canadian society by Protestant and Roman Catholic elements continued until well into the 20th century. Until the 1960s, most parts of Canada still had extensive [[Blue law|Lord's Day]] laws that limited what one could do on a Sunday.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alvin J.

Overtly Christian laws were expunged, including those against [[homosexuality]]. Policies favouring Christian immigration were also abolished.&lt;ref name="Moon2008v"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Moon|title=Law and Religious Pluralism in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ah66SQsk4hAC&amp;pg=PA244|year=2008|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5853-3|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, a nationwide census was taken after incorporation of predominantly Protestant province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].

According to statistics provided by [[Statistics Canada]], Protestants held a slight majority in the country between 1871 and 1961. Despite Canada's large Roman Catholic population, this fact is confirmed by nine consecutive national censuses. By 1961, Roman Catholics overtook Protestants as the most numerous religious group, although—unlike Protestants—they never reached the absolute majority status (&gt;50%).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===1960s and after===
The most overwhelming change occurred during the [[Quiet Revolution]] in [[Quebec]] in the 1960s. Up to the 1950s, the province was one of the most traditional [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] areas in the world. Church attendance rates were high, and the schools were largely controlled by the Church. In the 1960s, the Catholic Church lost most of its influence in Quebec, and religiosity declined sharply.&lt;ref name="georgetown3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/canada |title=Canada |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=December 12, 2011}} See drop-down essay on "History Since 1960"&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority of Québécois are still professed Latin rite Roman Catholics, rates of church attendance have decreased dramatically.&lt;ref name="Gill2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Gill|title=The Empty Church Revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=diCR1O9jnjYC&amp;pg=PA210|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3463-8|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, [[Common law]] relationships, [[abortion]], and support for [[same-sex marriage]] are more common in Quebec than in the [[English Canada|rest of Canada]].

[[File:United Church of Canada inauguration 1925.jpg|right|thumb|Inauguration of [[United Church]] at Mutual Street Arena, [[Toronto]], on June 10, 1925.]]

English Canada also underwent [[Secularity|secularization]]. The [[United Church of Canada]], the country's largest [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denomination, became one of the most liberal major Protestant churches in the world. Flatt argues that in the 1960s Canada's rapid cultural changes led the United Church to end its [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] programs and change its identity. It made revolutionary changes in its evangelistic campaigns, educational programs, moral stances, and theological image. However, membership declined sharply as the United Church affirmed a commitment to gay rights including marriage and ordination, and to the ordination of women.&lt;ref name="Cairns1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Earle E. Cairns|title=Christianity Through the Centuries: A History of the Christian Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3Kb3rPreUgC&amp;pg=PA507|year=1996|publisher=Zondervan Pub.|isbn=978-0-310-20812-9|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin N. Flatt, ''After Evangelicalism: The Sixties and the United Church of Canada'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Canada was 47% Catholic, 41% Protestant, 4% Other Religion and 4% Unaffilliated.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt;

Meanwhile, a strong current of evangelical Protestantism emerged. The largest groups are found in the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]] and [[Western Canada]], particularly in [[Alberta]], Southern [[Manitoba]] and the Southern interior and [[Fraser Valley]] region of [[British Columbia]], also known as the "Canadian Bible Belt", as well as parts of [[Ontario]] outside the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. The social environment is more conservative, somewhat more in line with that of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States]], and same-sex marriage, abortion, and common-law relationships are less widely accepted. This movement has grown sharply after 1960. The evangelicals increasingly influence public policy. Nevertheless, the overall proportion of evangelicals in Canada remains considerably lower than in the United States and the polarization much less intense. There are very few evangelicals in Quebec and in the largest urban areas, which are generally secular, although there are several congregations above 1000 members in most large cities.&lt;ref name="Rawlyk1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=George A. Rawlyk|title=Aspects of the Canadian Evangelical Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1c_3TggbrcC&amp;pg=PP1|year=1997|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=978-0-7735-1547-5|page=passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Montreal Bahá'í Shrine.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Montreal]] [[Bahá'í]] [[Shrine]].]]
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith in North America#Canada}}
The Canadian community is one of the earliest western communities of Bahá'ís, at one point sharing a joint National Spiritual Assembly with the United States, and is a co-recipient of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]'s [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The first North American woman to declare herself a Bahá'í was Kate C. Ives, of Canadian ancestry, though not living in Canada at the time. Moojan Momen, in reviewing "The Origins of the Bahá'í Community of Canada, 1898–1948" notes that "the Magee family... are credited with bringing the Bahá'í Faith to Canada. Edith Magee became a Bahá'í in 1898 in Chicago and returned to her home in London, Ontario, where four other female members of her family became Bahá'ís. This predominance of women converts became a feature of the Canadian Bahá'í community..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/momen_hoonaard_origins_bahai |title=Origins of the Baha'i Community of Canada 1898–1948, The, by Will C. van den Hoonaard |publisher=Bahai-library.com |accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
{{Further|Christianity in Canada}}

The majority of Canadian Christians attend [[church service]]s infrequently. Cross-national surveys of religiosity rates such as the Pew Global Attitudes Project indicate that, on average, Canadian Christians are less observant than those of the United States but are still more overtly religious than their counterparts in Western Europe. In 2002, 30% of Canadians reported to Pew researchers that religion was "very important" to them. A 2005 Gallup poll showed that 28% of Canadians consider religion to be "very important" (55% of Americans and 19% of Britons say the same).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/20986/Can-Reagan-Revolution-Happen-Canada.aspx |title=Can a "Reagan Revolution" Happen in Canada? |publisher=Gallup.com |date=January 20, 2006 |accessdate=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional differences within Canada exist, however, with [[British Columbia]] and [[Quebec]] reporting especially low metrics of traditional religious observance, as well as a significant urban-rural divide, while [[Alberta]] and rural [[Ontario]] saw high rates of religious attendance. The rates for weekly church attendance are contested, with estimates running as low as 11% as per the latest Ipsos-Reid poll and as high as 25% as per ''[[Christianity Today]]'' magazine. This American magazine reported that three polls conducted by [[Focus on the Family]], Time Canada and the Vanier Institute of the Family showed church attendance increasing for the first time in a generation, with weekly attendance at 25 per cent. This number is similar to the statistics reported by premier Canadian sociologist of religion, Prof. [[Reginald Bibby]] of the [[University of Lethbridge]], who has been studying Canadian religious patterns since 1975. Although lower than in the US, which has reported weekly church attendance at about 40% since the Second World War, weekly church attendance rates are higher than those in Northern Europe.

As well as the large churches&amp;nbsp;– Roman Catholic, United, and Anglican, which together count more than half of the Canadian population as nominal adherents&amp;nbsp;– Canada also has many smaller Christian groups, including [[Orthodox Christianity]]. The Egyptian population in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] ([[Greater Toronto]] in particular) has seen a large influx of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] population in just a few decades. The relatively large [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] population of [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] has produced many followers of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic]] and [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada|Ukrainian Orthodox Churches]], while southern Manitoba has been settled largely by Mennonites. The concentration of these smaller groups often varies greatly across the country. Baptists are especially numerous in the [[Canadian Maritimes|Maritimes]]. The Maritimes, prairie provinces, and [[southwestern Ontario]] have significant numbers of [[Lutherans]]. Southwest [[Ontario]] has seen large numbers of German and Russian immigrants, including many [[Mennonites]] and [[Hutterites]], as well as a significant contingent of Dutch Reformed. [[Alberta]] has seen considerable immigration from the American plains, creating a significant [[Mormon]] minority in that province. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] claimed to have 178,102 members (74,377 of whom in Alberta) at the end of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/canada-alberta Alberta] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216024628/http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/canada-alberta |date=December 16, 2008 }}. LDS Newsroom.&lt;/ref&gt; And according to the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] year report there are 111,963 active members (members who actively preach) in Canada.

Canada as a nation is becoming increasingly religiously diverse, especially in large urban centres such as [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Montreal]], where minority groups and new immigrants who make up the growth in most religious groups congregate. Two significant trends become clear when the current religious landscape is examined closely. One is the loss of ‘secularized' Canadians as active and regular participants in the churches and denominations they grew up in, which were overwhelmingly [[Christian]], while these churches remain a part of Canadians' cultural identity. The other is the increasing presence of ethnically diverse immigration within the religious makeup of the country.

[[File:Cardinal Gerald Lacroix.jpg|thumb|[[Gérald Cyprien Lacroix]] is the actual [[catholic]] [[Primate]] of Canada.&lt;ref name="cccb.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cccb.ca/site/frc/salle-de-presse/5006-update-from-cccb-delegates-attending-the-synod-of-bishops-on-young-people-the-faith-and-vocational-discernment|title=Conférence des évêques catholiques du Canada  - Nouvelles des délégués de la CECC qui participent au Synode des évêques sur les jeunes, la foi et le discernement vocationnel|website=www.cccb.ca|accessdate=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As Mainline [[Protestant]]s and [[Roman Catholic]]s have experienced drastic losses over the past 30 years, others have been expanding rapidly: overall by 144% in ‘Eastern' religions during the 1981–1991 decade.&lt;ref&gt;Roger O'Toole, "Religion in Canada: Its Development and Contemporary Situation" In Lori Beaman, ed., Religion and Canadian Society: Traditions, Transitions, and Innovations. (Toronto: Canadian Scholars' Press, 2006), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering Canada's increasing reliance on immigration to bolster a low birth rate, the situation is only likely to continue to diversify. This increased influx of ethnic immigrants not only affects the types of religions represented in the Canadian context but also the increasingly multicultural and multilingual makeup of individual Christian denominations. From [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Anglican]] or [[South Korea|Korean]] [[United Church]] communities, to the [[Lutheran]] focus on providing much needed services to immigrants new to the Canadian context and [[English language]], immigration is making changes.&lt;ref name="BramadatSeljak2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul A. Bramadat|author2=David Seljak|title=Christianity and Ethnicity in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4HzXN4HQkQC&amp;pg=PP268|year=2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-9584-8|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some Protestant [[Christian denomination|denominations]], adapting to a new [[secular]] context has meant adjusting to their non-institutional roles in society by increasingly focusing on [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger O'Toole, "Religion in Canada: Its Development and Contemporary Situation" In Lori Beaman, ed., Religion and Canadian Society: Traditions, Transitions, and Innovations. (Toronto: Canadian Scholars' Press, 2006), 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; However the pull between conservative religious members and the more radical among the church members is complicated by the numbers of immigrant communities who may desire a church that fulfils a more ‘institutionally complete' role as a buffer in this new country over the current tension filled debates over [[same-sex marriage]], [[ordination]] of women and homosexuals, or the role of women in the church. This of course will depend on the background of the immigrant population, as in the [[Hong Kong]] context where [[ordination]] of [[Florence Li Tim Oi]] happened long before women's ordination was ever raised on the Canadian [[Anglican]] church level.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Fletcher, "Canadian Anglicanism and Ethnicity" In P. Bramadat &amp; D. Seljak, Christianity and Ethnicity in Canada. (Toronto: Pearson Longman, 2005.), 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well a [[multicultural]] focus on the churches part may include non-Christian elements (such as the inclusion of a [[Buddhist]] priest in one incident) which are unwelcome to the transplanted religious community.&lt;ref&gt;Greer Anne Wenh-In Ng, "The United Church of Canada: A Church Fittingly National" In P. Bramadat &amp; D. Seljak, Christianity and Ethnicity in Canada. (Toronto: Pearson Longman, 2005), 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Serving the needs and desires of different aspects of the Canadian and newly Canadian populations makes a difficult balancing act for the various mainline churches which are starved for money and active parishioners in a time when 16% of Canadians identify as non-religious and up to two-thirds of those who do identify with a denomination use the church only for its life-cycle rituals governing birth, marriage, and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Analytic/companion/rel/canada.cfm |title=96F0030XIE2001015 – Religions in Canada |publisher=2.statcan.ca |accessdate=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church retains that hold in their [[parishioner]]s' lives but not the commitment of time and energy necessary to support an aging institution.

[[Evangelical]] portions of the Protestant groups proclaim their growth as well but as Roger O'Tool notes they make up 7% of the Canadian population and seem to gain most of their growth from a higher birthrate.&lt;ref&gt;Roger O'Toole, "Religion in Canada: Its Development and Contemporary Situation" In Lori Beaman, ed., Religion and Canadian Society: Traditions, Transitions, and Innovations. (Toronto: Canadian Scholars' Press, 2006), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; What is significant is the higher participation of their members in contrast to Mainline [[Protestant]]s and [[Roman Catholic]]s. This high commitment would seem to translate into the kind of political power evangelicals in the United States enjoy but despite Canada's historically [[Christian]] background as Lori Beaman notes neatly "...[forming] the backdrop for social process"&lt;ref&gt;Lori Beaman, ed., Religion and Canadian Society: Traditions, Transitions, and Innovations. (Toronto: Canadian Scholars' Press, 2006), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; explicit religiosity appears to have not effectively moved the government towards legal discrimination against gay marriage. Much as many Roman Catholics in [[Quebec]] ignore the Church's stance on [[birth control]], [[abortion]], or [[premarital sex]], the churches do not dictate much of the daily lives of regular Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;Roger O'Toole, "Religion in Canada: Its Development and Contemporary Situation" In Lori Beaman, ed., Religion and Canadian Society: Traditions, Transitions, and Innovations. (Toronto: Canadian Scholars' Press, 2006), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Percent Christians per Canadian Province gradient map (2011).svg|thumb|[[Percentage]] of Canadians identifying as Christian by province or territory.]]

There was a major religious revival in Toronto in the nineties known as the [[Toronto Blessing]] at a small [[Vineyard Church]] near the [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]]. This religious event was the largest tourist attraction to Toronto&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/march-web-only/enduring-revival.html|title=Christianity Today- The Enduring Revival|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|publisher=|access-date=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 1994. This event was characterized by unusual religious ecstascy such as being [[slain in the Spirit]], [[Holy laughter|laughing uncontrollably]], and other odd behavior.

==== Eastern Orthodox Christianity ====
{{Main|Eastern Orthodoxy in North America}}
Adherents of [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity in Canada belong to several ecclesiastical jurisdictions. Historically, Eastern Orthodoxy was introduced to Canada during the course of 19th century, mainly through emigration of Christians from [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. Honoring such diverse heritage, Eastern Orthodoxy in Canada is traditionally organized in accordance with patrimonial jurisdictions of [[autocephalous]] Eastern Orthodox Churches, each of them having its own hierarchy with dioceses and parishes. According to 2011 census data, [[Greek Orthodox]] community constitutes the largest Eastern Orthodox community in Canada, with 220,255 adherents. It is followed by other communities: Russian Orthodox (25,245), Ukrainian Orthodox (23,845), [[Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Canada|Serbian Orthodox]] (22,780), [[Romanian Orthodox Eparchy of Canada|Romanian Orthodox]] (7,090), [[Macedonian Orthodox Eparchy of America and Canada|Macedonian Orthodox]] (4,945), [[Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Diocese of the USA, Canada and Australia|Bulgarian Orthodox]] (1,765), [[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America|Antiochian Orthodox]] (1,220) and several other minor communities within Eastern Orthodoxy.&lt;ref name="www12.statcan.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=0&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=1&amp;PID=105399&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=105277&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2013&amp;THEME=95&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=|title=2011 National Household Survey: Data tables – Religion (108), Immigrant Status and Period of Immigration (11), Age Groups (10) and Sex (3) for the Population in Private Households of Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, 2011 National Household Survey|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|last=Canada|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gatineau Mosque .IMG 4651.jpg|right|thumb|Gatineau Mosque in [[Quebec]].]]
Four years after Canada's founding in 1867, the 1871 Canadian Census found 13 Muslims among the population.&lt;ref&gt;1871 Census of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Islam]] is the second largest religion in Canada, practised by 3.2% of the total population.&lt;ref name="statcan.gc.ca"/&gt; The first Canadian [[mosque]] was constructed in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] in 1938, when there were approximately 700 Muslims in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Aramco World: Canada's Pioneer Mosque: http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199804/canada.s.pioneer.mosque.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  This building is now part of the museum at [[Fort Edmonton Park]]. The years after [[World War II]] saw a small increase in the Muslim population. However, Muslims were still a distinct minority. It was only with the removal of European immigration preferences in the late 1960s that Muslims began to arrive in significant numbers.

According to [[Canada 2001 Census|Canada's 2001 census]], there were 579,740 [[Muslim]]s in Canada, just under 2% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo30a-eng.htm?sdi=religion |title=Population by religion, by province and territory (2001 Census) |publisher=0.statcan.gc.ca |accessdate=October 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810201649/http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo30a-eng.htm?sdi=religion |archivedate=August 10, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Muslim population was estimated to be 0.8&amp;nbsp;million or about 2.6%.

[[File:Holy Blossom Temple.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Holy Blossom Temple]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]].]]
The [[Jewish]] community in Canada is almost as old as the nation itself. The earliest documentation of [[Jews]] in Canada are British Army records from the [[Seven Years' War]] from 1754. In 1760, General [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst]] attacked and won [[Montreal]] for the British. In his regiment there were several Jews, including four among his officer corps, most notably Lieutenant [[Aaron Hart (businessman)|Aaron Hart]] who is considered the father of Canadian Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shalomquebec.org/members.aspx?mid=349 |title=Hart, Aaron |accessdate=March 25, 2009 |work=Exposition Shalom Québec |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727042141/http://www.shalomquebec.org/members.aspx?mid=349 |archivedate=July 27, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1807, [[Ezekiel Hart]] was elected to the legislature of [[Lower Canada]], becoming the first Jew in the [[British Empire]] to hold an [[official position]]. Hart was sworn in on a [[Hebrew Bible]] as opposed to a [[Christian Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Beginning of Jewish Emancipation in Canada: The Hart Affair|publisher=''Michael'', vol. 10|first=Michael|last=Brown|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=One a Day: An Anthology of Jewish Historical Anniversaries for Every Day of the Year|first=Abraham P.|last=Bloch|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc|year=1987|page=31|isbn=0-88125-108-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day an objection was raised that Hart had not taken the oath in the manner required for sitting in the assembly&amp;nbsp;– an oath of abjuration, which would have required Hart to swear "on the true faith of a Christian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Canadian Jewish Mosaic|last=Weinfeld|first=Morton |author2=Shaffir, William |author3=[[Irwin Cotler|Cotler, Irwin]]|year=1981|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-79929-7|pages=262, 385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart was expelled from the assembly, only to be re-elected two more times. In 1768, the first synagogue in Canada was built in Montreal, the [[Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal]]. In 1832, partly because of the work of Ezekiel Hart, a law was passed that guaranteed Jews the same political rights and freedoms as Christians.

The Jewish population saw a growth during the 1880s due to the [[pogroms]] of [[Russia]] and growing [[anti-Semitism]]. Between the years of 1880 and 1930 the Jewish population grew to 155,000. In 1872, [[Henry Nathan, Jr.]] became the first Jewish [[Member of Parliament]], representing the [[Victoria, BC]] area in the newly created [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. The [[First World War]] halted the flow of immigrants into Canada, and after the War there was a change in Canada's immigration policy to limit the immigration of people from "non-preferred nations", i.e., those not from the United Kingdom or otherwise [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] nations. In June 1939 Canada and the United States were the last hope for 907 Jewish refugees aboard the steamship [[SS St. Louis]] which had been denied landing in Havana although the passengers had entry visas. The Canadian government ignored the protests of Canadian Jewish organizations. King said the crisis was not a "Canadian problem" and Blair added in a letter to O.D. Skelton, Undersecretary of State for External Affairs, dated June 16, 1939, "No country could open its doors wide enough to take in the hundreds of thousands of Jewish people who want to leave Europe: the line must be drawn somewhere." The ship finally had to return to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/canada.html |title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour – Canada |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second World War]] almost twenty thousand Canadian Jews volunteered to fight overseas. Nearly 40,000 [[Holocaust]] survivors moved to Canada in the late 1940s to rebuild their lives.

Today the Canadian Jewish community is the fourth largest in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton61/st02_27.pdf |title=JEWISH POPULATION IN THE WORLD AND IN ISRAEL |publisher=CBS |date= |accessdate=November 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and practices in both of the official languages of Canada. There is an increase in the number of people that use [[Hebrew]], other than religious ceremonies, while there is a decline in the [[Yiddish]] language. Most of Canada's Jews live in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], with [[Toronto]] being the largest Jewish population centre. In 2009, anti-Semitic incidents jumped fivefold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/immigration/article/793643--anti-semitism-incidents-jump-five-fold-in-canada |title=Anti-semitism incidents jump five-fold in Canada |publisher=thestar.com |date=April 11, 2010 |accessdate=December 10, 2010 |location=Toronto |first=Nicholas |last=Keung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hinduism in Canada}}
[[File:BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Toronto.jpg|thumb|[[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Toronto]].]]
Hindus in Canada generally come from one of four groups. The first is primarily made up of [[India]]n [[immigrants]] who began arriving in [[British Columbia]] about 100 years ago and continue to immigrate today (Hindus from all over India immigrate to Canada today, but the largest Indian subgroups are the [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]] and [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]]). The second major group of Hindus immigrated from [[Sri Lanka]], going back to the 1940s, when a few hundred [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] migrated to Canada. The 1983 communal riots in [[Sri Lanka]] precipitated the mass exodus of [[Tamils]]. Another major subgroup of Hindus immigrated from Caribbean countries such as Trinidad and Guyana and form big communities in the Greater Toronto Area. These immigrants are often referred to as [[Indo-Caribbean]]. A third group is made up of Canadian converts to the various sects of [[Hinduism]] through the efforts of the [[Hare Krishna movement]], the [[Gurus]] during the last 50 years, and other organizations. Finally, the small [[Nepalese Canadian]] community is mostly Hindu.

According to the 2001 [[Census]] of Canada, there were 297,200 practitioners of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Stats"&gt;{{cite web| year = 2004| url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/highlight/Religion/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;View=1a&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=1&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=2&amp;B1=01&amp;B2=All| title =Selected Religions, for Canada, Provinces and Territories – 20% Sample Data| work =Religions in Canada: Highlight Tables, 2001 Census| publisher =[[Statistics Canada]]| accessdate=May 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[non-profit]] organization ''Association for Canadian Studies'' estimates the Hindu population grew to 372,500 by 2006, or just under 1.2% of the population of Canada. The vast majority of Hindus reside in [[Ontario]] (primarily in [[Toronto]], [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], Brampton, Hamilton, Windsor and [[Ottawa]]), [[Quebec]] (primarily around the [[Montreal]] area) and [[British Columbia]], (primarily around the [[Vancouver]] area).&lt;ref name="Stats"/&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism in Canada}}
There is a small, rapidly growing [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] community in Canada. At the 2001 census, 300,346 Canadians identified their religion as Buddhist, about 1% of the country's population.&lt;ref name="www40.statcan.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo30a-eng.htm |title=Population by religion, by province and territory (2001 Census) |publisher=0.statcan.gc.ca |accessdate=October 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114222020/http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/DEMO30A-eng.htm |archivedate=January 14, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism has been practised in Canada for more than a century and in recent years has grown dramatically. Buddhism arrived in Canada with the arrival of Chinese labourers in the territories during the 19th century.&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite web |author=A.W.

"'''Roll the Bones'''" is the title track and second single from [[Rush (band)|Rush]]'s 1991 [[Roll the Bones|album of the same name]].

== Background ==
The music of "Roll the Bones" was written by [[Geddy Lee]] and [[Alex Lifeson]], and its lyrics by [[Neil Peart]]. The lyrics reflect on taking chances in life, and urging those unsure to "roll the bones," a term used for [[dice]].  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But the bottom line...is to take the chance, roll the bones, if it's a random universe and that's terrifying and it makes you neurotic and everything, never mind. You really have to take the chance or else nothing's going to happen."&lt;br /&gt;
- Neil Peart, "It's A Rap" interview, February 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="It's A Rap" interview|date=February 1992|url=http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19920200rtbitsarap.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a "lyrical experiment", Peart wrote a "[[rapping|rap]]" section in his lyrics, as a result of listening to "the better rap writers", like [[LL Cool J]] and [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]].&lt;ref name=Songfacts&gt;[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3335 Songfacts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The band considered seeking out a real rapper to perform this section of the song, or even considered approaching the section with a [[camp (style)|camp]] or comedic sensibility, and hiring singer-songwriter [[Robbie Robertson]] or actor/comedian [[John Cleese]].&lt;ref name=Songfacts/&gt; According to Geddy Lee, "We couldn't make up our minds really if we wanted to be influenced by rap or satirize it, so I think that song kind of falls between the cracks and in the end I think it came out to be neither, it came out to be something that is very much us."&lt;ref name=Songfacts/&gt; Ultimately, the "rap" was performed by Lee: his altered voice is achieved through a drastic lowering of pitch and adding various effects.

==Live performance==
"Roll the Bones" would be played on every Rush tour since the song's release, up to the 2007-2008 [[Snakes And Arrows Tour]], when it was removed from the setlist. In 2015, the song was included in the setlist for the Rush R40 Tour. The R40 performance features an accompanying video for the rap section that had lip synching cameos from [[Peter Dinklage]], [[Chad Smith]], [[Jay Baruchel]], [[Les Claypool]], [[Tom Morello]], [[Paul Rudd]], [[Jason Segel]] and ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]'' actors [[John Paul Tremblay]], [[Robb Wells]] and [[Mike Smith (actor)|Mike Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jambase.com/Articles/125037/Les-Claypool-Tom-Morello-and-More-Appear-In-Rush-R40-Video&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sīstān''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]/[[Baloch language|Baloch]]/[[Pashto language|Pashto]]: '''سیستان'''), known in ancient times as '''Sakastan''' (Persian/Baloch/Pashto: '''ساكاستان'''; "the land of the [[Saka]]"), is a historical and [[Sistan Basin|geographical]] region in present-day eastern [[Iran]] ([[Sistan and Baluchestan Province]]) and southern [[Afghanistan]] ([[Nimruz Province|Nimruz]], [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]]).

==Etymology==
Sistan derives its name from ''[[Sakastan]]'' ("the land of the [[Saka]]"). The Sakas were a [[Scythians|Scythian]] tribe which from the 2nd century BC to the 1st century migrated to the [[Iranian Plateau]] and [[Indus valley]], where they carved a kingdom known as the [[Indo-Scythians|Indo-Scythian Kingdom]].{{sfn|Frye|1984|p=193}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1997|pp=681-685}} In the [[Bundahishn]], a [[Zoroastrian]] scripture written in [[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]], the province is called "Seyansih".{{sfn|Brunner|1983|p=750}} After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab conquest of Iran]], the province became known as Sijistan/Sistan.{{sfn|Bosworth|1997|pp=681-685}}

The more ancient [[Old Persian]] name of the region - prior to Saka dominance - was ''zaranka'' ("waterland"; cf. [[Pashto language|Pashto]] ''dzaranda''). This older form is also the root of the name [[Zaranj]], capital of the Afghan [[Nimruz Province]].

''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'' says "The name of the country and its inhabitants is first attested as Old Persian ''z-r-k'' (i.e., Zranka) in the great [[Behistun inscription|Bīsotūn inscription]] of [[Darius I]], apparently the original name. This form is reflected in the [[Elamite]] (Sir-ra-an-qa and variants), [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] (Za-ra-an-ga), and [[Ancient Egyptian language|Egyptian]] (''srng'' or ''srnḳ'') versions of the [[Achaemenid]] royal inscriptions, as well as in Greek Zarángai, Zarangaîoi, Zarangianḗ ([[Arrian]]; [[Isidore of Charax]]), and Sarángai ([[Herodotus]]) and in Latin Zarangae ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]). Instead of this original form, characterized by non-Persian z (perhaps from proto-IE. palatal ''*γ'' or ''*γh''), in some Greek sources (chiefly those dependent upon the historians of [[Alexander the Great]]) the perhaps [[hypercorrect]] Persianized variant (cf. Belardi, p. 183) with initial d-, *Dranka (or even *Dranga?), reflected in Greek Drángai, Drangḗ, Drangēnḗ, Drangi(a)nḗ ([[Ctesias]]; [[Polybius]]; [[Strabo]]; [[Diodorus]]; [[Ptolemy]]; Arrian; [[Stephanus Byzantius]]) and Latin Drangae, Drangiana, Drangiani ([[Curtius Rufus]]; Pliny; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]]; [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]) or Drancaeus ([[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''Argonautica'' 6.106, 6.507) occurs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

In the [[Shahnameh]], Sistan is also referred to as [[Zabulistan]], after the region in the eastern part of [[Iran]]. In Ferdowsi's epic, Zabulistan is in turn described to be the homeland of the mythological hero [[Rostam]].

==History==
===Early history===
{{see also|Zabulistan}}
In prehistoric times, the [[Jiroft Civilization]] covered parts of Sistan and [[Kerman Province]] (possibly as early as the 3rd millennium BC).

Later the area was occupied by [[Aryan]] tribes related to the [[Indo-Aryans]] and [[Iranian Peoples]]. Eventually a kingdom known as [[Arachosia]] was formed, parts of which were ruled by the [[Medes|Medean Empire]] by 600 BC. The Medes were overthrown by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]] in 550 BC, and the rest Arachosia was soon annexed. In the 4th century BC, Macedonian king [[Alexander the Great]] annexed the region during his conquest of the [[Persian Empire]] and founded the colony of "[[Alexandria in Arachosia]]" (modern [[Kandahar]]).

Alexander's Empire fragmented after his death, and Arachosia came under control of the [[Seleucid Empire]], which traded it to the [[Mauryan dynasty]] of India in 305 BC. After the fall of the Mauryans, the region fell to their [[Greco-Bactrian]] allies in 180 BC, before breaking away and becoming part of the [[Indo-Greek]] Kingdom. Indo-Parthian king [[Gondophares]] was leader of Sistan around c. 20–10 BCE as it was part of the [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] which was also called [[Gedrosia]],  its Hellenistic name.

After the mid 2nd century BC, much of the Indo-Greek Kingdom was overrun by tribes known as the [[Indo-Scythians]] or [[Saka]], from which Sistan (from [[Sakastan]]) eventually derived its name. The Indo-Scythians were defeated around 100 BC by the [[Parthian Empire]], which briefly lost the region to its [[House of Suren|Suren]] vassals (the [[Indo-Parthian]]) around 20 AD, before the region was conquered by the [[Kushan Empire]] in the mid 1st century AD. The [[Kushans]] were defeated by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persian Empire]] in the mid 3rd century, first becoming part of a vassal [[Kushansha]] state, before being overrun by the [[Hephthalites]] in the mid 5th century. Sassanid armies reconquered Sistan in by 565 AD, but lost the area to the Arab [[Rashidun]] Caliphate after the mid 640s.

=== Sasanian era ===
{{main|Sakastan}}
The province was formed in ca. 240, during the reign of [[Shapur I]], in his effort to centralise the empire; before that, the province was under the rule of the [[Parthia]]n [[Suren Kingdom]], whose ruler [[Ardashir Sakanshah]] became a Sasanian vassal during the reign of Shapur's father [[Ardashir I]] (r. 224–242), who also had the ancient city [[Zaranj|Zrang]] rebuilt, which became the capital of the province.{{sfn|Christensen|1993|p=229}} Shapur's son [[Narseh]] was the first to appointed as the governor of province, which he would govern until 271, when the Sasanian prince [[Hormizd of Sakastan|Hormizd]] was appointed as the new governor. Later in ca. 281, Hormizd revolted against his cousin [[Bahram II]]. During the revolt, the people of Sakastan was one of his supporters. Nevertheless, Bahram II managed to suppress the revolt in 283, and appointed his son [[Bahram III]] as the governor of the province. 
[[Image:Sakastan Sasanian era.png|thumb|300px|right|Map of [[Sakastan]] under the Sasanians.]]
During his early reign, [[Shapur II]] (r. 309-379)  appointed his brother [[Shapur Sakanshah]] as the governor of Sakastan. [[Peroz I]] (r. 459–484), during his early reign, put an end to dynastic rule in province by appointing a [[House of Karen|Karenid]] as its governor. The reason behind the appointment was to avoid further family conflict in the province, and in order to gain more direct control of the province.{{sfn|Christensen|1993|p=229}}

===Islamic conquest===
During the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], the last Sasanian king [[Yazdegerd III]] fled to Sakastan in the mid-640s, where its governor [[Aparviz of Sakastan|Aparviz]] (who was more or less independent), helped him. However, Yazdegerd III quickly ended this support when he demanded tax money that he had failed to pay.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=222}}{{sfn|Morony|1986|pp=203-210}}{{sfn|Zarrinkub|1975|p=24}}

In 650, [[Abd-Allah ibn Amir]], after having secured his position in [[Kerman Province|Kerman]], sent an army under [[Mujashi ibn Mas'ud]] to Sakastan. After having crossed the [[Dasht-i Lut]] desert, Mujashi ibn Mas'ud arrived to Sakastan. However, he suffered a heavy defeat and was forced to retreat.{{sfn|Marshak|Negmatov|1996|p=449}}

One year later, Abd-Allah ibn Amir sent an army under [[Rabi ibn Ziyad Harithi]] to Sakastan. After some time, he reached [[Zaliq]], a border town between Kirman and Sakastan, where he forced the [[dehqan]] of the town to acknowledge [[Rashidun]] authority.  He then did the same at the fortress of [[Karkuya]], which had a famous [[fire temple]], which is mentioned in the [[Tarikh-i Sistan]].{{sfn|Zarrinkub|1975|p=24}} He then continued to seize more land in the province. He thereafter besieged [[Zaranj|Zrang]], and after a heavy battle outside the city, Aparviz and his men surrendered. When Aparviz went to Rabi to discuss about the conditions of a treaty, he saw that he was using the bodies of two dead soldiers as a chair. This horrified Aparviz, who in order to spare the inhabitants of Sakastan from the Arabs, made peace with them in return for heavy tribute, which included a tribute of 1,000 slave boys bearing 1,000 golden vessels.{{sfn|Zarrinkub|1975|p=24}}{{sfn|Morony|1986|pp=203-210}} Sakastan was thus under the control of the Rashidun Caliphate.

===Caliphate rule===
However, only two years later, the people of Zarang rebelled and defeated Rabi ibn Ziyad Harithi's lieutenant and Muslim garrison of the city. Abd-Allah ibn Amir then sent [['Abd al-Rahman ibn Samura]] to Sistan, where he managed to suppress the rebellion. Furthermore, he also defeated the [[Zunbils]] of [[Zabulistan]], seizing [[Lashkar Gah|Bust]] and a few cities in Zabulistan.{{sfn|Zarrinkub|1975|p=24}}

During the [[First Islamic Civil War|First Islamic Civil War of 656–661]], the people of Zarang rebelled and defeated the Muslim garrison of the city.{{sfn|Morony|1986|pp=203-210}} In 658, Yazdegerd III's son [[Peroz III]] invaded Sistan and established a kingdom there, known in [[Tang dynasty|Chinese]] sources as the "Persian Area Command".{{sfn|Daryaee|2009|p=37}} However, in 663, he was forced to leave the region after suffering a defeat to newly established [[Umayyad Caliphate]], who had succeeded the Rashiduns.{{sfn|Daryaee|2009|p=37}}

=== Saffarid dynasty===
Sistan became a province of the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]]s. In the 860s, the [[Saffarid dynasty]] emerged in Sistan and proceeded to conquer most of the Islamic East, until it was checked by the [[Samanids]] in 900. After the Samanids took the province from the Saffarids, it briefly returned to Abbasid control, but in 917 the governor [[Abu Yazid Khalid]] made himself independent. He was followed by a series of emirs with brief reigns until 923, when [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad]] restored Saffarid rule in Sistan. After his death in 963, Sistan was ruled by his son [[Khalaf ibn Ahmad]] until 1002, when [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] invaded Sistan, ending the Saffarid dynasty.

A year later, Sistan revolted. In response, Mahmud brought an army to suppress the revolt. Mahmud's Hindu troops sacked the mosque of [[Zarang]] massacring the Muslims inside.&lt;ref&gt;C.E. Bosworth, ''The Ghaznavids 994-1040'', (Edinburgh University Press, 1963), 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nasrid dynasty===
In 1029, Tadj al-Din I Abu l-Fadl Nasr founded the [[Nasrid dynasty (Sistan)|Nasrid dynasty]], who were a branch of the [[Saffarids]]. They became vassals of the [[Ghaznavids]]. The dynasty then became vassals of the [[Seljuks]] in 1048, [[Ghurids]] in 1162, and the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmians]] in 1212. Mongols sacked Sistan in 1222 and Nasrid dynasty was ended by Khwarezmians in 1225.

=== Mihrabanid dynasty and its successors===
In 1236, [[Shams al-Din 'Ali ibn Mas'ud]] founded Mihrabanid dynasty, another branch of Saffarids, as melik of Sistan for [[Ilkhanate]]. Mihrabanid contested with [[Kartid]]s during Mongol rule. Sistan declared independence in 1335 after demise of Ilkhanate. 1383 [[Tamerlane]] conquered Sistan and forced Mihrabanids to become vassals. Overlordship of [[Timurids]] was ended in 1507 due to Uzbek invasion in 1507. Uzbeks were driven in 1510 and Mihrabanids became vassals of [[Safavids]] until 1537 Safavids deposed the dynasty and gained full control of Sistan.
[[Image:Jomann Imperium Periscum.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Map of the [[Safavid dynasty]] in ca. 1720, with Sistan as one of its major provinces.]]
Safavid rule was lasted till 1717 except Uzbeks rule between 1524 and 1528 and 1578 and 1598. In this year [[Hotaki dynasty]] conquered it. [[Nadir Shah]] reconquered in 1727. After assassination of Nadir Shah, Sistan under rule of [[Durrani Empire]] in 1747. Between 1747 and 1872 Sistan was contested with [[Persia]] and [[Afghanistan]]. The border dispute between Persia and Afghanistan was solved by Sistan Boundary Mission, led by British General [[ Frederick Goldsmid]], who agreed to most of Sistan in Persia but the Persians won the withdrawal of the right bank of the Helmand. The countries were not satisfied.

The border was defined more precisely with the Second Sistan Boundary Commission (1903-1905) headed by [[ Arthur Mac Mahon]], who had a difficult task due to lack of natural boundaries. The part assigned Persia was included in the province of Balochistan (which took the name of Sistan and Baluchistan in 1986) being the capital Zahedan. In Afghanistan it was part of the Sistan province of [[Farah-Chakansur Province|Farah-Chakansur]] that was abolished  in the administrative reorganization of 1964 to form the province of Nimruz, with capital Zaranj.

Sistan has a very strong connection with [[Zoroastrianism]] and during Sassanid times [[Lake Hamun]] was one of two pilgrimage sites for followers of that religion. In Zoroastrian tradition, the lake is the keeper of [[Zoroaster]]'s seed and just before the final renovation of the world, three maidens will enter the lake, each then giving birth to the ''[[Saoshyant|saoshyans]]'' who will be the saviours of mankind at the final renovation of the world.

The most famous archaeological sites in Sistan are [[Shahr-e Sukhteh]] and the site on [[Kuh-e Khwajeh]], a hill rising up as an island in the middle of Lake Hamun.

{{Jainism}}
'''Sukhlal Sanghvi''' (1880–1978), also known as '''Pandit Sukhlalji''', was a [[Jain]] scholar and philosopher. He belonged to the [[Sthanakvasi]] sect of [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name=Jaini&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }} Preface p. vi&lt;/ref&gt; Pandit Sukhlal lost his eyesight at the age of sixteen on account of smallpox. However, he overcame this handicap and became profoundly versed in Jain logic and rose to become a professor at Banaras Hindu University. [[Paul Dundas]] calls him one of the most incisive modern interpreters of [[Jain philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Dundas | first =Paul |author2=John Hinnels ed.  | title =The Jains | publisher =Routledge | year =2002 | location =London | isbn =0-415-26606-8 }} p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Dundas notes that Sanghavi represents what now seems to be a virtually lost scholarly and intellectual world.&lt;ref name="Jaini vi"&gt;Jaini p.vi&lt;/ref&gt; He was a mentor for famous Jain scholar [[Padmanabh Jaini]]. During his lifetime he won such awards as the [[Sahitya Akademi Award to Gujarati Writers|Sahitya Akademi Award]] and won recognition from the Government of India by getting [[Padma Bhushan]] award. Sukhlalji was also known as ''Pragnachaksu'' because he was so vastly learned despite being visually challenged.

==Early life==
Sukhlal was born in the village of Limli village of [[Surendranagar district]], Gujarat on 8 December 1880 (fifth day of the bright day of the month of Margshirsh in [[Vikram Samvat]] 1937).&lt;ref name=mohanlal&gt;{{cite book | last =Mohan Lal | first = |title =Encyclopaedia of Indian literature, Volume 5| publisher =Sahitya Akademi| year =2006 | location =New Delhi | ISBN =81-260-1221-8}} p. 4215&lt;/ref&gt; He belonged to '''Visa Shrimali [[Bania (caste)|Vanik]]''' community (merchant community) of Gujarat.{{cn|date=February 2016}} Talshi Sanghvi and his first wife Maniben were his parents. His mother died when he was four years old. He was raised in Limbdi by his  distant relative, Muljibhai from [[Sayla]]. He lost his eyesight following [[small pox]] infection when he was sixteen.  This made him more introspective and he devoted his life to learning.&lt;ref name=mohanlal /&gt;

==Learning==
He attended discourses of Jain monks, and studied scriptures with the help of a reader. In 1904, he joined Shri Yashovijaya Jain Sanskrit Pathshala at [[Benaras]]. Within three years he committed to memory the whole of ''Siddha-Hema-vyakarana''. Besides grammar, he studied ''Tarkasamraha'', ''Muktavali'', and ''Vyaptichakra'' with various commentaries. He also became well-conversant with epics like ''[[Raghuvamsha]]'', ''Maghakavya'', and ''Naishadhacharitam'', besides ''Alamkarashastra'' and ''Kosha''. For further studies he went to [[Mithila (India)|Mithila]] in 1911, and then to Kashi where he devoted himself to a study of philosophy and literature. Later, he went to [[Agra]] where he edited important Jain works like ''Panchapratikramana'', the first four Karma granthas of Devendrasuri. and ''Yogadarsana'' and ''Yogavimshika'' of [[Haribhadra]] Suri.&lt;ref name=mohanlal /&gt; After passing Nyayacarya examination he continued to teach at Jain pathshalas where his students included future scholar-monks like [[Muni Jinvijay]], Muni Lalitvijay and Muni Punyavijay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Wiley | first =Kristi | title =The A to Z of Jainism | publisher =Vision Books (originally published by Scarecrow Press) | year =2006 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-7094-690-5 | oclc =422763446 }} p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career as a scholar and a philosopher==
In 1922 he joined Puratattva Mandir of [[Gujarat Vidyapith]] as professor of [[Indian philosophy]]. Here he edited Sanamatitarka of Siddhasena Divakara in five volumes containing valuable indices and appendices. He was assisted by Pandit Bechardasji in this task. From 1933 to 1944 he was a professor of Jain Philosophy at [[Benaras Hindu University]]. He devoted most of his time to writing and editing a number of valuable works in Sanskrit, Hindi, and Gujarati. He edited [[Tattvarthasutra]] and Nyayavatara in Gujarati with texts and translations. He edited Pramana-mimamsa by [[Hemacandra]], with detailed introduction and notes. He not only corrected the original readings with the help of the photocopies of the original manuscripts but also gave other comparative readings. He critically edited Jayarashi's Tatavapaplava—a systematic work of [[Charvaka]]s which brought him wide recognition. He threw new light on the history of [[Buddhist philosophy]] by editing Archata’s commentary on [[Dharmakirti]]'s ''Hetubindu''. After retirement from Banaras Hindu University in 1944, he came back to [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]] where he worked with Jain monk Acarya Jinavijayaji. In 1957, Sukhlalji was invited by the M.S. University of Baroda to deliver five lectures on Indian philosophy, which were published in Gujarati (1951), Hindi (1971) and English (1977). His scholarly lectures or ''Atma-Paramatma'' and ''Sadhana'' delivered at Gujarat Vidyasabha were also published in Hindi and Gujarati under the title of ''Adhyatma vicharana'' The University of Bombay also invited him for lectures on Acharya [[Haribhadra]], which were published both in Gujarati (1961) and in Hindi (1966).

==Legacy and influences==
Young Sukhlalji was inspired by the writings of Pandit [[Nathuram Premi]], who was to become a close family friend. Sukhlalji was non-sectarian in his attitude and shared a good rapport with many [[Digambara]] scholars like Premiji and observed their mutual respect:&lt;ref&gt;Jain Study Circular (January–April 2006 Issue)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"He (Premiji) was considered to be a Pandit—a scholar of Jain tradition. To me it was a surprise! How could his writings be so impartial and audacious? I had come in contact with many Jain friends and scholars, but until then, excepting a few, I had not come across any scholar who was as non-sectarian or fearless as Premiji. So I had developed the perception that it was impossible to find a Jain scholar who was non-sectarian as well as fearless. Premiji's writings gradually made me realize that I had the wrong notion. This was the foremost reason for me to be attracted towards him.
:[...]
:We had an excellent understanding of traditions of one another but we had no sectarian complicities."

Sukhlalji also mentored three scholars of Jainism – Mahendrakumar Nyayacarya, Padmanabh Jaini and [[Dalsukh Dahyabhai Malvania|Dalsukh Malvania]]. Out of these, the second and third were his direct students. Sukhlalji always insisted on learning of [[Pali Canon]] for understanding Jainism and encouraged young Padmanabh Jaini to visit [[Sri Lanka]] to study [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (2000). p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Bimal Krishna Matilal|B. K. Matilal]] notes that Sukhlalji advocated "a non-partisan historical comparative study of any Sanskrit philosophical text" and noted in his preface to ''Advanced Studies in Indian Logic and Metaphysics (1961)'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Matilal | first =Bimal Krishna | title =Logic, language, and reality: Indian philosophy and contemporary issues| publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ | year =1990 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-0717-0 }} p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;
"I became firmly convinced that the study of any philosophical system inevitably demands certain prerequisites and these prerequisites include a fairly accurate understanding of the historical inter-relationships between the various philosophical systems of India."

He was known for his vast learning, sound scholarship, remarkable memory and for being a very ethical and conscientious person. Pandit Sukhlalji worked with a vast array of scholars and was good friends with all of them, despite not always agreeing with them. Some of the luminaries he worked with include: Muni Jinavijaya, Muni Punyavijaya, Acarya Premi Suri, Pandit Nathuram Premi, Pandit Jugalkishore Mukhtar, Dr. Hiralal Jain, Dr A. N. Upadhye, Dr. Mahendrakumar Nyayacarya, Prof. Dr. Padmanabh Jaini, Dr. Dalsukh Malvania and Dr. Nagin J. Shah.

== History ==
{{See also|Protestantism in the Philippines}}

=== The Evangelical Church ===
Presbyterian missionaries in the Philippines in April 1901 invited missionaries of other evangelical churches to a conference to discuss the possibility of working together in the proclamation of the gospel of faith alone as the only way of salvation for Filipino Catholics, Muslims and pagans. Representatives included those from the Methodist Episcopal Church {{ref|Protestant|1}}, the United Brethren in Christ (UBC) {{ref|Protestant|2}}, the Northern Baptist Church {{ref|Protestant|3}}, the Christian and Missionary Alliance, the Free Methodist Church, the British and Foreign Bible Society, the American Bible Society, and the Presbyterian Church.

The Evangelical Union was then formed on April 26, 1901. The evangelical churches agreed to call themselves “The Evangelical Church” (with the original denomination name in parenthesis below it). From 1898 to 1905 these are the mission churches joining in the agreement:
* [[Methodists]] (1898, most of lowland [[Luzon]] and north of [[Manila]])
* [[Presbyterians]] (1899, [[Bicol Region|Bicol]], Southern [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] area and some parts of [[Central Visayas|Central]] and [[Western Visayas]])
* [[Baptists]] (1900, Western Visayas)
* [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ|United Brethren]] (1901, [[Mountain Province]] and La Union)
* [[Christian Churches and Churches of Christ]]/[[Disciples of Christ]] (1901, [[Ilocos]], [[Abra (province)|Abra]], and [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] towns)
* [[Congregationalists]] (1902, [[Mindanao]] except for the western end)
* [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]] (1902, Western Mindanao and Sulu Archipelago)

Manila was opened to all denominations and mission agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Tuggy &amp; Oliver, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and Protestant [[Anglicanism|Episcopals]] did not join because they wanted to go to all parts of the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Montgomery and Donald A. McGavran, pp. 41-51&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The United Evangelical Church of the Philippines ===
{{Redirect|United Evangelical Church of Christ in the Philippines|the current Philippine denomination whose name translates to "United Evangelical Church of Christ"|Iglesia Evangelica Unida de Cristo}}
[[File:Manilajf7630 33.JPG|thumb|UECP, Benavides]]
The United Evangelical Church of the Philippines was organized in March 1929. It was a union of Presbyterian, United Brethren in Christ, and Congregationalist denominations along with the United Church of Manila. The Methodist and the (Northern) Baptist who were part of the Evangelical Union refused to join the new union. The doctrinal statement of union was the Nanking Agreement which was itself based on that of the Union Theological Seminary in Nanking, China. It had four major points:
* that the Old and New Testaments were the ''inspired Word of God'';
* that Jesus Christ is the divine Son of God, and offered atonement for sin by faith in his vicarious death;
* that the Holy Spirit is both divine and personal; and,
* that the Church has spiritual, but not political authority.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hamilton,.''The Movement Toward Church Union in the Philippines'',. The Philippine Presbyterian 14 (October 1924), 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it included United Brethren in Christ in northern Luzon, Presbyterians in southern Luzon and the Visayas and Congregationalists in Mindanao, the UEC was spread throughout the country. Enrique Sobrepena, a young leader in the United Brethren in Christ, was elected as the Moderator of the General Assembly.

=== The Philippine Methodist Church ===
{{methodism|align = right}}

{{redirect|Philippine Methodist Church|current church known in English as the Philippine Methodist Church|Ang Iglesia Metodista sa Pilipinas}}

After the foundation of the [[Iglesia Evangelica Metodista en las Islas Filipinas]] (IEMELIF) by Nicolas V. Zamora, a second major split occurred in the Methodist Church on March 23, 1933. About three years before, Melecio de Armas, a prominent minister had been accused by his colleagues of immorality towards a teenage girl, a church member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/node/202104 Heroic church - Manila Bulletin by Pres. Fidel Ramos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528075606/http://www.mb.com.ph/node/202104 |date=May 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1932 Philippine Annual Conference, a committee found the minister guilty and recommended his expulsion from the ministry, but the minister appealed the decision to the Appellant Committee of the General Conference of the [[Methodist Church of America]] (GCMCA). This Committee decided that it does not have enough evidence against the minister, so it acquitted him—thereby overturning the decision of the Philippine Conference. This brought to everyone’s attention the subordinate position of the Philippine church. Bishop Herbert Welch, at the 1933 Annual Conference, declared the matter closed, and reinstated the minister.&lt;ref&gt;Alejandro, From Darkness to Light, 158-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, a group led by [[Samuel Stagg]], pastor of the influential Central Church (now Central United Methodist Church on T.M. Kalaw), and including five other missionaries and 27 ordained Filipino ministers led by Cipriano Navarro and Melquiades Gamboa, a U.P. professor, left the church and declared themselves the General Conference of the Methodist Church in the Philippine Islands (GCMCPI). All but 41 members of Central Church left their newly dedicated gothic cathedral. This group formed the Philippine Methodist Church, with Navarro as bishop. The church financially supported the Staggs and the other missionaries who joined it. Stagg and his former members formed the [[Cosmopolitan Church]], which became the leading congregation of the new denomination. The independent GCMCPI elected Navarro as acting General Superintendent. In 1948 the Philippine Methodist Church was a constituent part of the formation of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines.

=== The Evangelical Church of the Philippines ===
The Evangelical Church of the Philippines was formed in 1943 under the direction of the [[Japanese Occupation of the Philippines|Japanese Imperial Forces]]. It brought together the United Evangelical Church; the [[Christian Churches and Churches of Christ]] ([[Disciples of Christ]]); the Iglesia Evangelica Unida de Cristo; the [[Iglesia Evangelica Metodista en las Islas Filipinas]] (IEMELIF) founded by Bishop Nicholas Zamora; the Iglesia Evangelica Nacional; the Philippine Methodist Church; some [[Seventh-day Adventists]] and other churches. It was the first union of churches under full Filipino leadership.

After World War II, former Presbyterians and Congregationalists reconstituted the United Evangelical Church. On the other hand, the former United Brethren in Christ, together with the Church of Christ (Disciples of Christ) and the independent congregations remained as the Evangelical Church of the Philippines. Because the Seventh-day Adventists was forced by the war to join the merger, they immediately left the Evangelical Church of the Philippines after the war.&lt;ref name="UCCP Davao City Official Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uccpdavao.wordpress.com/about/|title=Profile|date=26 May 2008|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The United Church of Christ in the Philippines ===
[[File:BatangasCityCentrojf9784 26.JPG|thumb|United Church of Christ in the Philippines (Batangas City).]]
In May 1948, the United Evangelical Church, the Philippine Methodist Church, the Evangelical Church of the Philippines, some congregations of the Iglesia Evangelica Unida de Cristo, the Convention of the [[Churches of Christ]] ([[Disciples of Christ]]) of Northern Luzon, the Iglesia Evangelica Nacional and some congregations of the Iglesia Evangelica Metodista En Las Islas Filipinas (IEMELIF) joined together to form the United Church of Christ in the Philippines. Enrique Sobrepena of the United Evangelical Church served both as Bishop for Luzon and as Presiding Bishop.

This was the real culmination of the efforts of the Evangelical Union established by missionaries on April 26, 1901 to seek the evangelization of the Philippines through a common effort. In spite of the refusal of the United Methodist, Baptist and other independent evangelical churches, the UCCP was known to be the most visible sign of interdenominational and church unity in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="UCCP Davao City Official Website"/&gt;

In 1962, the conservative Tagalog Convention of the [[Churches of Christ]] ([[Disciples of Christ]]) decided to join the union of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines. It was proclaimed in an appropriate ceremonies at the General Assembly held in Cebu City. In 1998, [[Nelinda Primavera-Briones]] was the first woman elected as bishop of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines.

== Faith and Practice ==
The United Church of Christ in the Philippines is [[Trinitarianism|trinitarian]] and believes in the deity, humanity, and atonement of Jesus.  It believes that the [[Bible]], in both the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired Word of God and that [[salvation]] is by grace through faith, repentance and following after Christ.  The United Church of Christ in the Philippines view the Christian life as one of personal faith and of serious dedication to living according to the highest Christian precepts. Each person is thus to be born again, converted into a new life, and gathered into the church community. For them, the church is essentially the result of conversion and of grace, a gathered community of committed believers. It is not the mother of Christian experience or the source (rather than the effect) of grace, as in the Roman Catholic tradition. The church is, therefore, holy only because the faith and life of its people are holy.

The UCCP traces its roots in the [[Protestant Reformation]], when [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]] and others led the movement to reform the Christianity. This is often expressed in the "[[Five Solas]]"—God's grace alone as the only way to be reconciled to God, faith alone as the only means of receiving God's grace, Christ alone as the ground of God's saving grace, Scripture alone as the only infallible authority for belief, and God's glory alone as the ultimate purpose for the lives of men and women.

The following distinguish the UCCP from other communions:
* Their concern for freedom of speech and conscience and for freedom from interference by any civil or ecclesiastical authority
* The primacy they give to Scripture in matters of faith, doctrine, and morals
* The authority they give to the congregation in church affairs
* Their concern for establishing social justice in political, social and economic life and
* Their active involvement and commitment to interdenominational activity as a protest against denominational exclusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;UCCP Baguio [http://islandchurches.org/uccpbaguio.islandchurches.org/content.php?content_id=100 Faith and Practice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423052303/http://islandchurches.org/uccpbaguio.islandchurches.org/content.php?content_id=100 |date=April 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sacraments ===
The church believes that there are two sacraments only: baptism and The Lord's Supper. The church takes a neutral position on the observance of [[feet washing]], taking into consideration the various traditions brought in by the uniting churches. The 1948: Article III Historic Faith and Message states, " We do preserve all the heritage of faith brought into the union by each of the constituent churches and hereby declare as our common faith and message: 'Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, our Lord and Saviour.'&lt;ref&gt;UCCP Constitution and By-Laws&lt;/ref&gt;"

==== Baptism ====
The UCCP defines baptism as a sacrament of initiation into the church.&lt;ref name="cdeouccp.org"&gt;The United Church of Christ in the Philippines Cagayan de Oro City - MEMBERSHIP [http://cdeouccp.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14:membership&amp;catid=6:faq&amp;Itemid=22]&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that baptism is not a means of salvation but a first step of obedience for the new believer. The church permit believer's baptism, and infant baptism alike. Infant baptism is administered only to infant children of church members as a sign of God's covenant of mercy.  In recent times infant baptism has given way to more frequent infant "dedication" ceremonies or ''Paghahandog'' (in Filipino), thus reserving baptism until after the time when the child makes a conscious decision to follow Christ. The church also recognize and accept the baptism of other Christian churches.&lt;ref name="cdeouccp.org"/&gt;

Disciples' understood that baptism is a confessional expression of faith and repentance, rather than a "work" that earns salvation. Thus they insisted that believer's baptism is necessary part of conversion and necessary for its validity. Local churches in the Tagalog and Ilocano regions established by their missionaries practice only baptism by immersion by its adult members.

==== Lord's Supper ====
The church believes in the symbolic presence&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucanews.com/1999/12/15/covenant-between-churches-brings-unity-of-25-million-christians-closer/ Union of Catholic Asian News]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Jesus in the Lord's Supper (''Santa Cena o Banal na Hapunan in Filipino''). They believe that it was given by Jesus Christ&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;United Church of Christ in the Philippines Cagayan de Oro City - COMMUNION [http://cdeouccp.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12:communion&amp;catid=6:faq&amp;Itemid=20]&lt;/ref&gt; to his church as a way of remembering and proclaiming the sacrifice He made on the cross. It is a sacrament that contains an element of remembering and proclaiming Christ's death while at the same time looking forward to the time when they will enjoy communion with Christ in heaven.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It involves solemn and serious self-examination. This includes confession of sin and repentance. Communion for them should not be received in a flippant or careless manner.It is the joyful feast of the Lord, hence, it is a celebration.

Every UCCP church is required to celebrate the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper once a month. In most local churches, communion is served in the first Sunday of the month. The observance of the Rite of the Last Supper of our Lord with His disciples is done during Maundy Thursday or Holy Thursday.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Since the Disciples of Christ custom is to have the Lord's Supper central to every worship service, the sacrament is administered every Lord's Day.

=== Contemporary Issues ===
The church believes that every man or woman should be accepted and treated with dignity, grace, and holy love, whatever their sexual orientation (biological sex of person attracted to). In 2014, the denomination voted to adopt a policy that "means that LGBTs should not be discriminated but should be unconditionally accepted...[and] Bishop Marigza confirms the openness to ordain openly gay and lesbian church workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://outragemag.com/uccp-approves-lgbt-policy-statement-stresses-let-grace-total/|title=UCCP approves LGBT policy statement, stresses ‘Let Grace Be Total’ - Outrage Magazine|website=outragemag.com|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a congregation of the denomination hosted the first LGBT-themed worship service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://outragemag.com/uccp-in-iloilo-hosts-citys-first-mass-for-lgbt-community/|title=UCCP in Iloilo hosts city’s first mass for LGBT community - Outrage Magazine|website=outragemag.com|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Church of Christ in the Philippines has allowed [[ordination of women]] with full rights of clergy based on biblical principle.{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|3:28}} "''There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.''" The UCCP, along with some other Evangelical Churches, holds that when the historical contexts involved are understood, a coherent Biblical argument can be made in favor of women's ordination.

== Worship Services ==
UCCP local churches typically have worship services three times a week: Sunday morning, Sunday evening, and Wednesday evening. The local congregation has a great deal of freedom in the style and ordering of worship and therefore worship varies from congregation to congregation. The order may be very traditional and highly liturgical, or it may be very simple and informal. Music plays a large role in most UCCP worship services and ranges from chant to traditional Protestant hymns, to classical sacred music, to more modern music, depending on the preference of the local church. Scripture is read and usually preached upon. An offering is usually taken. Services are often focused toward a time of prayer and commitment at the end of the sermon.  Over the last ten years, an increasing number of UCCP churches have utilized contemporary worship services as their worship style. This may involve the use of a projector to display song, drums and electronic piano, clapping of hands, tambourine dance and raising of hands.  More traditional UCCP churches use hymnals and may have a song leader or music director who directs congregational singing from the pulpit.

== Mission, Evangelism and Social Concern ==
The United Church of Christ in the Philippines has, historically, been a leading Protestant denomination in mission work. A vital part of the world mission emphasis of the denomination is building and maintaining relationships with Evangelical, Protestant and other churches around the world. Connection between evangelism and social concern was maintained by the UCCP. In 1952, the UCCP established the UCCP National Federation of Credit Unions to aid farmers. They also issued a Resolution Condemning Gambling and Liquor. Sobrepena approved, a relationship between the UCCP and the Orient Crusades (OC) International - Philippine Crusades. OC entered the Philippines agreeing to work in cooperation with UCCP leaders, to prepare converts for membership in the UCCP, and to avoid controversial doctrinal issues. They focused on mass evangelism and witness to students, and used film showings such as ''King of Kings'' to make contacts. Interested seekers availed of Bible correspondence courses. Sobrepena held mass evangelistic campaigns—notably in [[Laoag]] in November 1955, with the OC cooperation.

In 1973 to 1986, local churches allowed American missionaries from the [[Youth With A Mission]] to reorganize Sunday Schools and set up Sunday school programs.&lt;ref name="50yearsministry.blogspot.com"&gt;A TRIBUTE TO BISHOP MARIGZA ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS ORDINATION TO THE MINISTRY, APRIL 11, 1957 TO APRIL 11, 2007 [http://50yearsministry.blogspot.com/2008/09/tribute-to-bishop-marigza-on-50-th.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This international, interdenominational Christian missionary organization also promoted Christian movies in secular theaters throughout the archipelago. Many Filipinos from this time are in full-time Christian service today or are productive Christians. In addition, a number of indigenous churches were established among squatter communities in Metro Manila, in Baguio and villages in the Cordilleras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ywam.org.ph/ |title=YWAM Philippines History |access-date=1999-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991003053342/http://www.ywam.org.ph/ |archive-date=1999-10-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Then the Philippine [[Campus Crusade for Christ]], also an international interdenominational movement came in and started the evangelistic movement in the church that started the increase in church attendance and membership.&lt;ref name="50yearsministry.blogspot.com"/&gt;

Some local churches, joined international fellowship such as the Covenant Global Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbmin.org/Phil-Sailboats.html|title=Phil-Sailboats|website=www.rbmin.org|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other churches involved themselves into the [[Evangelism Explosion]], a ministry that trains people how to share their faith in Christ.

The United Church of Christ in the Philippines in Baguio City is an active member of the [[Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches]] (PCEC) [http://www.pceconline.org/about/localchurch.htm].

==Early life and career==

Breeze came from a military family. Son of a [[US Army]] serviceman, he was born in Paris, [[France]], where his father, [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] Breeze, was on a [[tour of duty]] at the time of his birth. Breeze spent his childhood accompanying his father, who had a very distinguished military career, on many [[tour of duty|tours of duty]] across the United States, staying with him at various [[US]] military bases, including [[Nellis Air Force Base]] located in close proximity to [[Groom Dry Lake Air Force Base]] in Nevada which is a highly classified remote detachment 83 miles (134&amp;nbsp;km) north-northwest of Las Vegas&lt;ref name="“express.co.uk01"&gt;{{cite news |title=SHOCK CLAIM: Footage of ‘alien UFO being tested at Area 51 leaked’ |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/809310/Area-51-leaked-video-UFO-Nellis-Air-Base-aliens-Secureteam10 |date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; closely linked to [[UFO]] phenomena,&lt;ref name="“express.co.uk02"&gt;{{cite news |title=Huge UFO 'disappeared into wormhole' after bizarre events near top secret military base |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/809310/Area-51-leaked-video-UFO-Nellis-Air-Base-aliens-Secureteam10 |date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Fort Bragg]] and [[Fort Meade, Maryland]]&lt;ref name="“newsweek.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=MEET THE FORMER PENTAGON SCIENTIST WHO SAYS PSYCHICS CAN HELP AMERICAN SPIES |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/11/20/meet-former-pentagon-scientist-who-says-psychics-can-help-american-spies-393004.html |date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Remote viewing]] [[Stargate Project|program]] took place,&lt;ref name="“miamiherald.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fort Meade, Maryland, where psychics gathered to remotely spy on the U.S. Embassy in Iran during the hostage crisis. |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article131827589.html |date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montauk Air Force Station]] at the eastern tip of [[Long Island]], which was later associated with supposed [[time travel]] experiments&lt;ref name="“Montauk Chronicles"&gt;{{cite news |title='Montauk Chronicles' Claims Time Travel, Mind Control, Aliens At Camp Hero |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/montauk-chronicles-time-travel-aliens_n_1543063|accessdate=30 March 2018 |date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Montauk Project]].&lt;ref name="“MONTAUK TIME TRAVEL?"&gt;{{cite news |title=HAS THE GOVERNMENT ALREADY ACHIEVED TIME TRAVEL? |url=https://www.gaia.com/lp/content/has-the-government-already-achieved-time-travel|accessdate=30 March 2018 |date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breeze was later educated at Harvard University in Boston where he studied music.&lt;ref name="“Coil: Members"&gt;{{cite news |title=Coil: Members |url=http://www.brainwashed.com/coil/info/bill.html|accessdate=15 March 2018 |date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970s Breeze became a student of [[Marcelo Ramos Motta]], a [[Thelema|Thelemic]] writer from [[Brazil]], himself a former [[Military Academy]] student, as well as a student of [[Aleister Crowley]] and member of [[A∴A∴]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Motta | first = Marcelo | title = The Equinox, vol. V no. 4 | publisher = Thelema Publishing Co. | location = Nashville | year = 1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 Breeze helped to publish [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on The Book of the Law''. Eedited by [[John Symonds]] and [[Kenneth Grant]], it was published by 93 Publishing, a company which was partially owned by Breeze. In 1979, when Breeze was 24 years old, he met [[Grady McMurtry]]. A veteran of the [[Normandy Invasion]] and the conquest of [[Nazi occupied Europe|Nazi-occupied Europe]], Major McMurtry served in both [[World War Two]] and the [[Korean Conflict]], and having trained and been initiated directly by [[Aleister Crowley]] who appointed him his "Caliph", McMurtry was serving as the head of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]], an international [[Fraternal organization|fraternal]] organization founded in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Crowley | first = Aleister| authorlink = Aleister Crowley | editor = Hymenaeus Beta | others = Soror Meral, Research Ed.| title = The Review of Scientific Illuminism: The Official Organ of the O.T.O | edition = Revised | series = The Equinox #10 | volume = III | origyear = March 1986 |date=July 1990 | publisher = [[Weiser Books]] | location = York Beach, Maine | isbn=0-87728-719-8 | ref=Eq310 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMurtry granted Breeze a charter to form an [[Ordo Templi Orientis|OTO]] lodge of which Breeze later became a master. In 1985, Breeze succeeded McMurtry as Outer Head of OTO. After McMurtry's death, under Breeze's leadership, OTO began to grow internationally for the first time. Over the next decade, Breeze spent his time establishing International Headquarters and chartering new Lodges. By the end of the Twentieth Century, the organization has grown to several thousand members over time.&lt;ref name="Hymenaeus Beta Governing Anniversary“"/&gt;

==Governing of O.T.O.==
{{Thelema}}
Since 21 September 1985, Breeze served as the Head of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].&lt;ref name="Hymenaeus Beta Governing Anniversary“"&gt;{{cite news|title=ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF O.T.O. |url=http://zeroequalstwo.net/new-book-success-is-your-proof-celebrates-one-hundred-years-of-o-t-o-in-north-america/ |accessdate=15 March 2018 |date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of [[Grady McMurtry]] who was heading the Order at the time, Breeze was elected as Frater Superior of Ordo Templi Orientis in a special election by all the active IX° members of OTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Koenig |first=Peter |url=http://www.parareligion.ch/minutes/trans.htm |title=Minutes of the Special Ninth Degree Caliphate Election |work=The Ordo Templi Orientis Phenomenon |accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assumed the name ''Hymenaeus Beta'',&lt;ref name="Hymenaeus Beta: Election anniversary“"&gt;{{cite news|title=31st Anniversary of election of William Breeze to succeed Grady McMurtry |url=http://zeroequalstwo.net/31-anniversary-of-election-of-hymenaeus-beta-to-succeed-alpha |accessdate=13 March 2018 |date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in that capacity became widely acknowledged as an expert on the life and works of [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref name="“Works researched via Hymenaeus Beta"/&gt;

[[File:Looking along Ridge above Loch Ness - geograph.org.uk - 912966.jpg|left|thumb|The ridge above [[Loch Ness]] Foyers and Boleskine walk comes down past Boleskine. Located below, [[Boleskine House]] can be seen from the forest track.]] Breeze devoted much of his time working in the preservation of the Order’s heritage materials relating to [[Boleskine House]] (manor house in the [[Scottish Highlands]] previously owned by Aleister Crowley, who bought it for the purpose of performing a magical working based on [[The Book of Abramelin]]) and OTO’s archival materials in England.&lt;ref name="caduceus“"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caduceusbooks.com/secondhandbooks-webpage/sh-crow.htm |title=Aleister Crowley: Last Days |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devoting much of his time in administering the Order, Breeze also devoted a lot of time to development of the corpus of Thelemic literature and preservation of OTO's archival heritage.&lt;ref name="Hymenaeus Beta Governing Anniversary“" /&gt;  [[File:First Pentacle of Venus.gif|left|thumb|The first pentacle of Venus from a 1889 edition of The [[Key of Solomon]] first translated and edited from Ancient Manuscripts in the [[British Museum]] by [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]], now held in O.T.O. archives]]

Breeze, furthermore, made available his own researches, undertaken for the definitive edition of Crowley’s [[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley|Confessions]] that were published in 1990,&lt;ref name="abebooks09“"&gt;{{cite news|title=THE CONFESSIONS OF ALEISTER CROWLEY, 1990|url=https://www.abebooks.co.uk/book-search/title/the-confessions-of-aleister-crowley-an-autohagiography/author/aleister-crowley/ |accessdate=3 July 2018 |date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the biography’s co-editor.&lt;ref name="esoteric01“"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Art of the Law: Aleister Crowley’s Use of Ritual and Drama|url=http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeV/ArtofLaw.htm |accessdate=3 July 2018 |date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his capacity of a Head of OTO, Breeze helped many worthy investigators such as [[Lawrence Sutin]] (author of ''DO WHAT THOU WILT: A Life of Aleister Crowley'' published in 2000, {{ISBN|978-0312288976}}),&lt;ref name="kirkusreviews“"&gt;{{cite news|title=DO WHAT THOU WILT: A Life of Aleister Crowley |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lawrence-sutin/do-what-thou-wilt/ |accessdate=2 April 2018 |date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Kaczynski]] (author of ''Perdurabo: Life of Aleister Crowley'' published in 2010 by [[North Atlantic Books]], {{ISBN|978-1556438998}}), [[Tobias Churton]] (author of ''Aleister Crowley: The Biography'' published by [[Watkins Books]] in 2012, {{ISBN|978-1780281346}}),&lt;ref name="express.co.uk01“"&gt;{{cite news|title=Aleister Crowley: The Biography |url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/272066/Aleister-Crowley-The-Biography-review |accessdate=2 April 2018 |date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Adam Clayton (author of ''Netherwood: Last Resort of Aleister Crowley.'' published by [[Weiser Antiquarian Books]] in 2012, {{ISBN|978-0957233409}}),&lt;ref name="caduceus“"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radionics“"&gt;{{cite news|title=Aleister Crowley: Gentleman of Hastings |url=http://radionicworkshop.co.uk/netherwood-by-a-gentleman-of-hastings/|accessdate=4 April 2018 |date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to study OTO, Thelema, Aleister Crowley and related topics using the materials OTO is the guardian of.&lt;ref name="Aleister Crowley: The Biography“"&gt;{{cite news|title=Aleister Crowley: The Biography.

Starting in 2005, Breeze begun chartering new international Grand Lodges, including those of [[Australia]] and [[U.K.|United Kingdom]] which covers England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, plus British Crown Dependencies.&lt;ref name="Agape Lodge Journal“"&gt;{{cite news|title=Agape Lodge journal: Vol VII, Number 3 |url=http://lib.oto-usa.org/agape/agape.7.3.pdf |accessdate=17 March 2018 |date=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2014, Breeze was unanimously elected de jure Outer Head of the Order by a council of Grand Masters, and on May 16, 2015, his organisation celebrated 30 years of his governing of [[Ordo Templi Orientis|OTO]].&lt;ref name="Hymenaeus Beta Governing Anniversary“" /&gt;
