      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4924">'''Aharon Perlow''' ({{lang-he|אהרון פרלוב}}; 1839 &amp;ndash; 1897) was the third [[Rebbe]] of the [[Koidanov (Hasidic dynasty)|Koidanov]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[List of Hasidic dynasties|dynasty]]. He was a charismatic leader who attracted thousands of followers and effected a revival of the Koidanover dynasty founded by his grandfather, Rabbi Shlomo Chaim Perlow (1797-1862). He authored several important works that became standard texts for Koidanover Hasidim to this day, including a [[siddur]], ''Seder Tefilot Yisrael Or Hayashar'' ("The Direct Light: Order of Prayers of Israel").

==Biography==
Perlow was born in Koidanov (present-day [[Dzyarzhynsk]], [[Belarus]]) to Rabbi Baruch Mordechai Perlow (1818–1870), the second Koidanover Rebbe. He was the great-great-grandson of both Rabbi Mordechai of [[Lyakhavichy]] (Lechovitch) (c. 1742&amp;ndash;1810) and Rabbi Asher Perlow of Karlin.&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt; Before acceding to the leadership of the Koidanover Hasidim, he was the Rav of the Koidanover [[shtiebel]] in Lechovitch. He pioneered the opening of prayer houses in different towns that followed the teachings of the Rebbes of Lechovitch, [[Kobryn]], [[Slonim]], and Koidanov.&lt;ref name="gen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/lyakhovichi/rabbonim.htm |title=Rabbonim, Rebbes, and Crown Rabbis, of Lyakhovichi |first=Deborah G. |last=Glassman |year=2004 |publisher=[[JewishGen]]|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the third Koidanover Rebbe upon the death of his father in 1870.&lt;ref name="YIVO"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe |first=Allen|last=Nadler  |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Koidanov_Hasidic_Dynasty|title=Koidanov Hasidic Dynasty|accessdate=20 June 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new rebbe’s charismatic personality and scholarship attracted thousands of Hasidim to Koidanov.&lt;ref name="YIVO"/&gt; He built [[synagogue]]s in many other towns to spread Koidanover influence,&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt; and strengthened the Koidanover community founded in [[Tiberias]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], by his grandfather.&lt;ref name="YIVO"/&gt; While he supported settlement in the [[Land of Israel]], he spoke strongly against the tenets of [[Zionism]]. He reportedly told his Hasidim: "Whoever gives money to [[Hovevei Zion]] [a forerunner of Zionism which encouraged Jewish immigration to Palestine] forfeits his reward in the world to come, despite all the charitable deeds that he may have performed and may yet perform throughout his life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mS6oW4TTuwkC&amp;pg=PA33 |title=Zionism and Religion |first1=Shmuel |last1=Almog |first2=Jehuda |last2=Reinharz |first3=Anita |last3=Shapira |year=1998 |publisher=UPNE |isbn= 9780874518825 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his writings and demeanor, Rebbe Aharon embodied the "mystical-charismatic style" of the Rebbes of [[Karlin-Stolin]], of which Koidanov is a branch.&lt;ref name="YIVO"/&gt; A scholar of [[Kabbalah]], he published and annotated a number of classic kabbalah works, including Rabbi [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero|Moshe Cordovero]]'s ''Or Ne'erav'', to which he appended his commentary ''Nir'eh Or'' (1899), and Rabbi [[Moses Hagiz|Moshe Hagiz]]' ''Sefat Emet'', which he supplemented with teachings on the significance of the [[Land of Israel]] in kabbalistic and Hasidic works (1876).&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0012_0_11377.html |title=Koidanov |year=2012 |accessdate=20 June 2012 |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also authored a [[siddur]] entitled ''Seder Tefilot Yisrael Or Hayashar'' ("The Direct Light: Order of Prayers of Israel"), in which he enumerated "eight mystical practices for spiritual perfection". This siddur is still used by Koidanover Hasidim today.&lt;ref name="YIVO"/&gt; Other works, including ''Haggadah shel Pesach Siach Avot'' (1991) and ''Zekher Tzadik'' (1905), were published posthumously.&lt;ref name="YIVO"/&gt; His brother, Rabbi Shalom of Koidanov-Bruhin (1850&amp;ndash;1925), was also a prolific writer whose works expanded the literature and teachings of Koidanov.&lt;ref name="YIVO"/&gt;

The present-day Koidanover Rebbe, Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi Meir Ehrlich, is the great-grandson of the son-in-law of Rebbe Aharon.&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="matzav"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matzav.com/koidenover-rebbe-in-queens-tonight |title=Koidenover Rebbe in Queens Tonight |first=Dovid |last=Bernstein |date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=21 June 2012 |publisher=matzav.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Veronese-Triomphe_de_Venise.jpg|thumb|''Apotheose of Venezia'' (1585) by [[Paolo Veronese]]]]
[[File:Baen_Witt_Victor_Medway.jpg|thumb|''The apotheosis of Cornelis de Witt, with the raid on Chatham in the background.'' The original by Jan de Baen, kept in the City Hall of Dordrecht, was destroyed in 1672.]]
'''Apotheosis''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀποθέωσις from ἀποθεοῦν, ''apotheoun'' "to deify"; in Latin ''deificatio'' "making divine"; also called '''divinization''' and '''deification''') is the glorification of a subject to [[divinity|divine]] level. The term has meanings in [[theology]], where it refers to a [[belief]], and in [[art]], where it refers to a [[genre]].

In theology, ''apotheosis'' refers to the idea that an individual has been raised to godlike stature. In art, the term refers to the treatment of any subject (a figure, group, locale, motif, convention or melody) in a particularly grand or exalted manner.

==Antiquity==
{{further information|imperial cult|divine king}}
Before the Hellenistic period, [[imperial cult]]s were known in [[Ancient Egypt]] ([[pharaoh]]s) and [[Mesopotamia]] (since [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]). From the [[New Kingdom]], all deceased pharaohs were deified as the god [[Osiris]].

==Ancient Greece==
{{Main article|Greek hero cult}}
From at least the [[Geometric art|Geometric]] period of the ninth century BC, the long-deceased heroes linked with [[founding myth]]s of Greek sites were accorded [[chthonic]] rites in their ''[[heroon]]'', or "hero-temple".

In the Greek world, the first leader who accorded himself divine honours was [[Philip II of Macedon]]. At his wedding to his sixth wife, Philip's enthroned image was carried in procession among the [[Olympian gods]]; "his example at [[Vergina|Aigai]] became a custom, passing to the Macedonian kings who were later worshipped in [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek Asia]], from them to [[Julius Caesar]] and so to the emperors of Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'' (1973:20)&lt;/ref&gt; Such Hellenistic state leaders might be raised to a status equal to the gods before death (e.g., [[Alexander the Great]]) or afterwards (e.g., members of the
[[Ptolemaic dynasty]]). A heroic cult status similar to apotheosis was also an honour given to a few revered artists of the distant past, notably [[Homer]].

Archaic and Classical Greek hero-cults became primarily civic, extended from their familial origins, in the sixth century; by the fifth century none of the worshipers based their authority by tracing descent back to the hero, with the exception of some families who inherited particular priestly cults, such as the [[Eumolpides]] (descended from [[Eumolpus]]) of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]], and some inherited priesthoods at [[oracle|oracle site]]s. The Greek hero cults can be distinguished on the other hand from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|cult of dead emperors]], because the hero was not thought of as having ascended to Olympus or become a god: he was beneath the earth, and his power purely local.  For this reason hero cults were [[chthonic]] in nature, and their rituals more closely resembled those for [[Hecate]] and [[Persephone]] than those for [[Zeus]] and [[Apollo]]. Two exceptions were [[Heracles]] and [[Asclepius]], who might be honoured as either gods or heroes, sometimes by chthonic night-time rites and sacrifice on the following day.

==Ancient Rome==
{{main article|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)}}
Up to the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], Romans accepted only one official apotheosis: the god [[Quirinus]], whatever his original meaning, having been identified with [[Romulus]].{{sfn|Garnett|Mackintosh|1911}} Subsequently, apotheosis in [[ancient Rome]] was a process whereby a deceased ruler was recognized as having been divine by his successor, usually also by a [[S.P.Q.R.|decree of the Senate and popular consent]]. In addition to showing respect, often the present ruler deified a popular predecessor to legitimize himself and gain popularity with the people. The upper-class did not always take part in the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]],{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} and some privately ridiculed the apotheosis of inept and feeble emperors, as in the satire ''[[The Pumpkinification of Claudius|The Pumpkinification of (the Divine) Claudius]]'', usually attributed to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].

At the height of the imperial cult during the [[Roman Empire]], sometimes the [[Roman emperor|emperor]]'s deceased loved ones—heirs, empresses, or lovers, as Hadrian's [[Antinous]]—were deified as well. Deified people were awarded posthumously the title ''Divus'' (''Diva'' if women) to their names to signify their divinity. [[Religion in ancient Rome|Traditional Roman religion]] distinguished between a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#deus, dea, di, dii|deus]]'' (god) and a ''[[divus]]'' (a mortal who became divine or deified), though not consistently. Temples and columns were erected to provide a space for worship.

==Ancient China==
The [[Ming dynasty]] epic ''[[Fengshen Yanyi|Investiture of the Gods]]'' deals heavily with deification legends. Numerous mortals have been deified into the [[Daoism|Daoist]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], such as [[Guan Yu]], [[Iron-crutch Li]] and [[Fan Kuai]]. [[Song Dynasty]] General [[Yue Fei]] was deified during the [[Ming Dynasty]] and is considered by some practitioners to be one of the three highest ranking heavenly generals.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, James T. C. "Yueh Fei (1103-41) and China's Heritage of Loyalty." ''The Journal of Asian Studies''. Vol. 31, No. 2 (Feb., 1972), pp. 291-297, pg. 296

==Southeast Asia and North Korea==
Various Hindu and Buddhist rulers in the past have been represented as deities, especially after death, from [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thailand]] to [[Indonesia]].  Even several [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Sultans of Yogyakarta]] were semi-deified{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}, posthumously.

Deceased North Korean leader [[Kim Il-Sung]] is the principal object of the [[North Korean cult of personality]] in which he is treated similarly to an explicitly apotheosized leader, with statues of and monuments dedicated to the "[[Eternal President]]", the annual commemoration of his birth, the paying of respects by newlyweds to his nearest statue,&lt;ref name="North Korean newlywed couples in their best attire bow before the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang"&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/domain/nimg.sulekha.com/search?q=North+Korean+newlywed+couples+in+their+best+attire+bow+before+the+statues+of+Kim+Il+Sung+and+Kim+Jong+Il+in+Pyongyang], Photograph of North Korean newlywed couples in their best attire bowing before the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang, from Reddit.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[North Korean calendar]] being a [[Juche]] calendar based on Kim Il-sung's date of birth.

==Christianity==

===Generally===
{{main article|Divinization (Christian)}}
Instead of the word "apotheosis", Christian theology uses in English the words "deification" or "divinization" or the Greek word "''theosis''". Traditional mainstream theology, both East and West, views [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] as the preexisting God who undertook mortal existence, not as a mortal being who attained divinity. It holds that he has made it possible for human beings to be raised to the level of sharing the divine nature: he became one of us to make us "partakers of the divine nature"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; "For this is why the Word became man, and the Son of God became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son of God.''"&lt;ref&gt;[[Irenaeus of Lyon]], ''Adversus haereses'', 3.19.1&lt;/ref&gt; "For He was made man that we might be made God."&lt;ref name="AthanasiusOnTheIncarnation54_3"&gt;St. Athanasius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html ''On the Incarnation of the Word'' 54.3] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QWCtlc7G?url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html |date=2007-07-22 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas]], Opusc. 57, 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology contains the following in an article titled "Deification":

:''Deification (Greek theosis) is for Orthodoxy the goal of every Christian. Man, according to the Bible, is 'made in the image and likeness of God.'. . . It is possible for man to become like God, to become deified, to become god by grace. This doctrine is based on many passages of both OT and NT (e.g. Ps. 82 (81).6; II Peter 1.4), and it is essentially the teaching both of St Paul, though he tends to use the language of filial adoption (cf. Rom. 8.9—17; Gal. 4.5—7), and the Fourth Gospel (cf. 17.21—23).''

:''The language of II Peter is taken up by St Irenaeus, in his famous phrase, 'if the Word has been made man, it is so that men may be made gods' (Adv. Haer V, Pref.), and becomes the standard in Greek theology. In the fourth century, St. Athanasius repeats Irenaeus almost word for word, and in the fifth century St Cyril of Alexandria says that we shall become sons 'by participation' (Greek methexis). Deification is the central idea in the spirituality of St. Maximus the Confessor, for whom the doctrine is the corollary of the Incarnation: 'Deification, briefly, is the encompassing and fulfillment of all times and ages,' . . . and St. Symeon the New Theologian at the end of the tenth century writes, 'He who is God by nature converses with those whom he has made gods by grace, as a friend converses with his friends, face to face.' . . .''

===Eastern Christianity===
Eastern Christian theology does not use the term "apotheosis".{{cn|date=September 2018}}

===Roman Catholic Church===
The Roman Catholic Church also does not use the term "apotheosis".

Corresponding to the Greek word ''theosis'' are the [[Latin]]-derived words "divinization" and "deification" used in the parts of the [[Catholic Church]] that are of Latin tradition. The concept has been given less prominence in Western theology than in that of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], but is present in the [[Latin Church]]'s liturgical prayers, such as that of the deacon or priest when pouring wine and a little water into the chalice: "By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article "deification"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] quotes with approval [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius's]] saying, "The Son of God became man so that we might become God."&lt;ref name="AthanasiusOnTheIncarnation54_3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 460] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201419/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM |date=February 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic theology stresses the concept of supernatural life, "a new creation and elevation, a rebirth, it is a participation in and partaking of the divine nature"&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Fries, ''[http://www.google.com/search?q=Fries+Catholic+%22partaking+of+the+divine+nature%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 Bultmann-Barth and Catholic theology]'' (Duquesne University Press 1967), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. {{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|ESV}}). In Catholic teaching there is a vital distinction between natural life and supernatural life, the latter being "the life that God, in an act of love, freely gives to human beings to elevate them above their natural lives" and which they receive through prayer and the sacraments; indeed the Catholic Church sees human existence as having as its whole purpose the acquisition, preservation and intensification of this supernatural life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?q=%22stephen+m.+o%27brien%22+%22supernatural+life%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 Stephen M.

{{main article|Exaltation (Mormonism)|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)}}
{{see also|Mormon cosmology|King Follett discourse}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church or [[Mormons]]) believes in apotheosis along the lines of the Christian tradition of [[divinization (Christian)|divinization]] or deification but refers to it as [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]], or eternal life, and considers it to be accomplished by "sanctification." It believes that people may live with God throughout eternity in families and eventually become gods themselves but remain subordinate to God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit. While the primary focus of the LDS Church is on [[Jesus of Nazareth]] and His atoning sacrifice for man,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Smith]] declared, "The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it" (See ''Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith'', sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 121).&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that one purpose for Christ's mission and for His atonement is the exaltation or [[Divinization (Christian)|Christian deification]] of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.lds.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng | title = Gospel Topics: Becoming Like God | work = LDS.org | publisher = LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third Article of Faith of Mormon Christianity states that all men may be saved from sin by the atonement of Jesus Christ, and LDS Gospel Doctrine (as published) states that all men will be saved and will be resurrected from death. However, only those who are sufficiently obedient and accept the atonement and the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ before the resurrection and final judgment will be "exalted" and receive a literal Christian [[Divinization (Christian)|deification]].

Mormons believe that the original Christian belief in man's divine potential gradually lost its meaning and importance in the centuries after the death of the apostles, as doctrinal changes by post-apostolic theologians caused Christians to lose sight of the true nature of God and His purpose for creating humanity. The concept of God's nature that was eventually accepted as Christian doctrine in the 4th century set divinity apart from humanity by defining the [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]] as three persons sharing a common divine substance. That classification of God in terms of a substance is not found in scripture&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mozley The creed or a philosophy 1893 p303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/creed_homoian_of_constantinople_360.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925052330/http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/creed_homoian_of_constantinople_360.htm |archivedate=2014-09-25 |df= }} (the wording of the [[Council of Constantinople (360)]] prohibited use of the terms "substance," "essence," and "ousia" since they were not included in the scriptures)&lt;/ref&gt; but, in many aspects, mirrored the Greek metaphysical philosophies that are known to have influenced the thinking of Church Fathers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/trinity-history.html#Aug|title=Trinity &gt; History of Trinitarian Doctrines (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], and [[Augustine]]. Mormons teach that by modern revelation, God restored the knowledge that He is the literal father of our spirits (Hebrews 12:9) and that the Biblical references to God creating mankind in His image and likeness are in no way allegorical. As such, Mormons assert that as the literal offspring of God the Father (Acts 17:28-29), humans have the potential to be heirs of His glory and co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:16-17). The glory, Mormons believe, lies not in God's substance but in His intelligence: in other words, light and truth (Doctrine and Covenants 93:36&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 93|author=|date=|website=www.lds.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205003752/http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng|archivedate=2013-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus, the purpose of humans is to grow and progress to become like the Father in Heaven. Mortality is seen as a crucial step in the process in which God's spirit children gain a body, which, though formed in the image of the Father's body, is subject to pain, illness, temptation, and death. The purpose of this earth life is to learn to choose the right in the face of that opposition, thereby gaining essential experience and wisdom. The level of intelligence we attain in this life will rise in the Resurrection (Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19). Bodies will then be immortal like those of the Father and the Son (Philippians 3:21), but the degree of glory to which each person will resurrect is contingent upon the Final Judgment (Revelation 20:13, 1 Corinthians 15:40-41). Those who are worthy to return to God's presence can continue to progress towards a fullness of God's glory, which Mormons refer to as eternal life, or [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]] (Doctrine and Covenants 76).

The LDS concept of apotheosis/exaltation is expressed in LDS scriptures (Mosiah 3:19, Alma 13:12, D&amp;C 78:7, D&amp;C 78:22, D&amp;C 84:4, D&amp;C 84:23, D&amp;C 88:68, D&amp;C 93:28) and is expressed by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: "Though stretched by our challenges, by living righteously and enduring well we can eventually become sufficiently more like Jesus in our traits and attributes, that one day we can dwell in the Father's presence forever and ever" (Neal Maxwell, October 1997).

In early 2014, the LDS church published an essay on the official church website specifically addressing the foundations, history, and official beliefs regarding apotheosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng|title=Becoming Like God|first=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day|last=Saints|date=|website=www.lds.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129065539/https://www.lds.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng|archivedate=2014-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay addresses the scriptural foundations of this belief, teachings of the early Church Fathers on the subject of deificiation, and the teachings of LDS church leaders, starting with Joseph Smith.

==In art==
In art the matter is practical: the elevation of a figure to divine level entails certain conventions. So it is that the apotheosis genre exists in Christian art as in other art. The features of the apotheosis genre may be seen in subjects that emphasize Christ's divinity ([[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], Christ [[Pantocrator]]) and that depict holy persons "in glory"—that is, in their roles as "God revealed" (Assumption, Ascension, etc.).

[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|Apotheosis of French soldiers fallen in the Napoleonic Wars, [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], beginning of 19th century.]] [[File:Apotheosis of George Washington.jpg|thumb|Apotheosis of George Washington]]

[[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Apotheosis of Homer, 1827.jpg|thumb|Ingres, ''[[The Apotheosis of Homer (Ingres)|The Apotheosis of Homer]]''.]]
[[File:Apotheosis-of-saint-louis.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Apotheosis of St. Louis]]'', St. Louis MO]]
[[File:Allegory of Gdańsk trade.jpg|thumb|right|''Apotheosis of Gdańsk'' by [[Isaak van den Blocke]].]]

Later artists have used the concept for motives ranging from genuine respect for the deceased ([[Constantino Brumidi]]'s fresco ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'' on the dome of the [[United States Capitol]] Building in [[Washington, D.C.]]), to artistic comment ([[Salvador Dalí]]'s or [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s ''[[The Apotheosis of Homer (Ingres)|The Apotheosis of Homer]]''), to [[mock-heroic]] and [[burlesque]] apotheoses for comedic effect.

Many modern leaders have exploited the artistic imagery if not the theology of apotheosis. Examples include [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]'s depictions of [[James I of England]] at the [[Banqueting House]] (an expression of the [[Divine Right of Kings]]) or [[Henry IV of France]], or Appiani's apotheosis of [[Napoleon]]. The [[Charles Henry Niehaus|C. H. Niehaus]]-designed ''[[Apotheosis of St. Louis]]'' ([[Louis IX of France]]) became a symbol for St. Louis MO. The term has come to be used figuratively to refer to the elevation of a dead leader (often one who was assassinated and/or martyred) to a kind of superhuman charismatic figure and an effective erasing of all faults and controversies which were connected with his name in life - for example, [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[US]], [[Lenin]] in the [[USSR]], [[Yitzchak Rabin]] in [[Israel]], or [[Kim Jong-il]] in [[North Korea]].

==In music==
''Apotheosis'' in music refers to the appearance of a theme in grand or exalted form. It represents the musical equivalent of the apotheosis genre in visual art, especially where the theme is connected in some way with historical persons or dramatic characters. When crowning the end of a large-scale work the apotheosis functions as a [[peroration]], following an analogy with the art of [[rhetoric]].

Apotheosis moments abound in music, and the word itself appears in some cases. In the [[List of compositions by François Couperin]] there are 3 suites entitled "Apotheoses" (1724), [[Hector Berlioz]] used "Apotheose" as the title of the final movement of his ''Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale'', a work composed in 1846 for the dedication of a monument to France's war dead. Two of  [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballets, ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', contain apotheoses as finales; the same is true of [[Ludwig Minkus]]'s ''[[La Bayadère]]''. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s composed [[Orpheus (ballet)]] and [[Apollo (ballet)]] for [[choreographer]] [[George Balanchine]] which both contain episodes entitled "Apotheose". The concluding tableau of [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Ma mère l'Oye]]'' is also titled  "Apotheose." Czech composer [[Karel Husa]], concerned in 1970 about arms proliferation and environmental deterioration, named his musical response ''Apotheosis for This Earth''. [[Aram Khachaturian]] entitled a segment of his ballet ''[[Spartacus (ballet)|Spartacus]]'' "Sunrise and Apotheosis." [[Richard Wagner]], referring to the lively [[rhythm]]s which permeate [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 7]], called it the "apotheosis of the dance".&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{cite book |title= Beethoven and his nine symphonies |last= Grove |first= Sir George |authorlink= George Grove |year= 1962 |publisher= [[Dover Publications]] |location= [[New York City|New York]] |edition= 3rd |oclc= 705665 |pages= 228–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alexander Glazunov]]'s ballet ''[[The Seasons (ballet)|The Seasons]]'', Op.67 has as the concluding movement:-  Autumn: Scene and Apotheosis.

American [[technical death metal]] band [[The Faceless]] explored the idea of Apotheosis in the first three tracks of their 2012 album ''Autotheism''. The first three tracks are one song broken into three parts called "The Autotheism Movement".

{{Vijayanagara empire}}
The '''Aravidu Dynasty''' was the fourth and last [[Hindu]] dynasty which ruled [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in [[South India]]. Its founder was [[Tirumala Deva Raya]], whose brother Rama Raya had been the masterful regent of the last ruler of the previous dynasty. Rama Raya's death at the [[Battle of Talikota|Battle of Rakasa-Tangadi]] (also known as the Battle of Talikota) in 1565 led to the subsequent destruction of Vijayanagar by the combined forces of the Muslim states of Bijapur. 

The Aravidu family claimed to be Kshatriyas and were based in Andhra region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Journal of the Andhra Historical Society, Volumes 14-17 |date=1953 |publisher=Andhra Historical Research Society |page=61 |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rulers==
The main rulers of the Aravidu dynasty were: 
*[[Aliya Rama Raya]] (1542–1565)
*[[Tirumala Deva Raya]] (1565–1572)
*[[Sriranga Deva Raya]] (Sriranga I) (1572–1586)
*[[Venkatapati Deva Raya]] (Venkata II) (1586–1614)
*[[Sriranga II]] (1614)
*[[Rama Deva Raya]] (1617–1632)

The '''Bahá'í Faith in Andorra''' begins with the first mention of Andorra in [[Bahá'í literature]] when [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] listed it as a place to take the religion to in 1916.&lt;ref name="tablets"&gt;{{cite book|author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá | origyear = 1916-17 |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-6.html|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Bahá'í to [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]] to Andorra was William Danjon Dieudonne in 1953.&lt;ref name="50th"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Mountainous country marks anniversary| newspaper = Bahá'í International News Service | location = Andorra la Vella, Andorra | publisher = Bahá’í International Community | date = 18 November 2004 | url =http://news.bahai.org/story/335 | accessdate = 2010-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1979 a Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] in [[Andorra-la-Vella]] is known.&lt;ref name="BN581"&gt;{{cite magazine | title =Victory Messages; The Baha'i world resounds with the glorious news of Five Year Plan victories (section mentioning Andorra)|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1979 | number = 581 | page =11 |ISSN=0043-8804 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 according to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) there were about 80 Bahá'ís in Andorra.&lt;ref name="ARDA05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Andorra | work = International &gt; Regions &gt; Southern Europe | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_6_2.asp | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[Wolfram Alpha]] estimated about 120 Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="Wolfram"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Andorra: population, capital, cities, GDP, map, flag, currency, languages, ... | encyclopedia = Wolfram Alpha | volume = Online | publisher = Wolfram - Alpha (curated data( | date = March 13, 2010 | url =http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/countries/andorra/xy/p0/k6/ | accessdate = 2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early phase==

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
In the history of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] the first mention of [[Andorra]] is in the twentieth century. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several countries in [[Europe]] including beyond where `Abdu'l-Bahá had visited in 1911-12. Written on April 11, 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The seventh tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |author2=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab |author3=trans. and comments  | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.… Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands."&lt;ref name="tablets"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Establishment of the community===
Starting in 1946, following [[World War II]], [[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after `Abdu'l-Bahá, drew up plans for the American (US and Canada) Bahá'í community to send [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to Europe; the Bahá'ís set up a European Teaching Committee chaired by [[Edna True]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Warburg | first = Margit | editor = Peter Smith | title = Bahá'ís in the West | publisher = Kalimat Press | year = 2004 | pages = 228–63 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=x7wyJdyE60oC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=hlmFDBtqxOwDtX3by7wn6EYCqec#PPA233,M1 | isbn = 1-890688-11-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a follow-up conference in Stockholm in August 1953, [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Dorothy Beecher Baker]] asked for a Bahá'í to settle in Andorra and French-born William Danjon Dieudonne volunteered. He left his home in Denmark and arrived in on 7 October 1953 and so was listed as a [[Knight of Bahá'u'lláh]] thereafter. In 1954, two residents of Andorra, Carmen Tost Xifre de Mingorance and her husband, Jose Mingorance Fernandez, joined the religion.&lt;ref name="50th"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio-bio"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Biographies - William DANJON (Michel AVRIL) | work = Histoire de Radio Andorre| publisher = Aqui Radio Andorra| url =http://aquiradioandorra.free.fr/Biographies/Avril_Michel.html | accessdate = 2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the biography at [[Radio Andorra]], in July 1955 Danjon was hired by Radio Andorra, where he worked under a pseudonym on air: Michel Avril. Michael is his middle name and Avril is the month of birth (April). He did not hide that he had come to promote the religion. In May 1963 Danjon left Radio Andorra and became Assistant Secretary of the Syndicat d'Initiatives Valleys of Andorra in Andorra la Vella, then in 1966 became director of the House of Andorra in Paris. Then from 1975 to 1981, he worked at [[Sud Radio]] and then joined the Andorran Ministry of Education and Culture until 1989.&lt;ref name="Radio-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Album de photos de William DANJON (Michel AVRIL) | work = Histoire de Radio Andorre| publisher = Aqui Radio Andorra| url =http://aquiradioandorra.free.fr/Biographies/Avril_Michel02.html | accessdate = 2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth==
In 1963 statistics on the community listed a registered ''group'' (less than 9 Bahá'ís) in [[Andorra-la-Vella]].&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#19 | title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963| author = Compiled by [[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] is noted in 1979 - as well as Bahá'ís living in a total of 3 locations in Andorra.&lt;ref name="BN581"/&gt;

By 1978 European countries other than Soviet and [[Microstates and the European Union|Microstates of Europe]] had their own [[Bahá'í administration#National Spiritual Assemblies|Bahá'í National Assembly]].

Regional conferences were called for by the [[Universal House of Justice]], current head of the religion, in October 2008 and one was held for the Iberian peninsula 24–25 January 2009 to celebrate recent achievements in grassroots community-building and to plan their next steps in organizing in their home areas.

In 2005 according to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) the Bahá'ís amounted to 0.1% or about 80 Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="ARDA05"/&gt; In 2010 [[Wolfram Alpha]] lists 0.1459% or about 120 Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="Wolfram"/&gt;

This tradition is considered as a part of the number of other traditions that led to amalgamation in a later stage of the historical development and culminate in worship of [[Radha Krishna]] as [[Svayam bhagavan]]. Other [[monotheist]] traditions are [[Bhagavatism]] and [[Cult of Gopala]], that along with [[Cult of Krishna-Vasudeva]] form the basis of the current tradition of the monotheistic [[Krishna]] religion.&lt;ref name = kk20072&gt;{{cite book

| quote = Present day Krishna worship is an amalgam of various elements. According to historical testimonies [[Krishna-Vasudeva]] worship already flourished in and around Mathura several centuries before Christ. A second important element is the cult of Krishna Govinda. Still later is the worship of Bala-Krishna, the Divine Child Krishna - a quite prominent feature of modern Krishnaism. The last element seems to have been Krishna Gopijanavallabha, Krishna the lover of the Gopis, among whom [[Radha]] occupies a special position. In some books Krishna is presented as the founder and first teacher of the Bhagavata religion.

&lt;/ref&gt; however it is one of the most popular deities of Krishna in many parts of India today.&lt;ref name = kk20072/&gt; Early evidence of such worship can be found or as early as the 4th century BC according to evidence in [[Megasthenes]] and in the [[Arthashastra]] of [[Kautilya]], when ''Vāsudeva'' (as the son of [[Vasudeva]] was worshiped as supreme Deity in a strongly monotheistic format, where the supreme Being was perfect, eternal and full of grace.&lt;ref name = "Hastings"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hastings|2003|pp=540–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the miraculous acts of the form are notable. It is believed that [[Putana]], a huge monster, was killed when the baby Krishna sucked her life from her by taking the poisoned breast she offered him.&lt;ref name = Hawley97/&gt;

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], it appears Krishna is teaching a universal monotheistic religion of [[personal God]] and reveals himself to be all-God, [[svayam bhagavan]].

The prominent historical Site is the Balakrishna temple in [[Hampi]] built by the ruler [[Krishnadevaraya]] in 1513. Main altar of the temple is 
dedicated to Bala Krishna and it is one of the few temples where stories of [[Purana]]s were carved on the walls of the temple and its main tower.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable image is [[murti]] of Bala Krishna worshiped by [[Madhvacharya]] in his Sri Krishna Matha of [[Udupi]].

&lt;/ref&gt; Legend has it that this was the very same [[murti]] which wife of [[Krishna]], [[Rukmini]], had worshipped. Liberation from the world of matter required grace and dependence on God and active devotion, such as worshipping the Lord in the form of an icon (murti). Madhva placed such an icon of Bala Krishna in his monastery in Udipi where it remains to be seen by pilgrims to this day.&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite book |author=Knott, Kim |title=Hinduism: a very short introduction |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1998 |isbn=0-19-285387-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the image was installed, [[Udupi]] has been steadily gaining in importance as a centre of pilgrimage. It is believed [[Madhvacharya]] saved drifting ship, from which he received in gratitude two large balls of [[Chandan Yatra|chandan]] clay used as a ballast. To the amazement of all in each there was confined a deity form, one of [[Krishna]] and one of [[Balarama]], the deity of Krishna with a churner in his hand was called ''Bala Krishna'' and was installed in the main Udupi shrine. The sacred lamps at this statue of Bala Krishna recovered from the sea in the 14th century were lit by [[Madhvacharya]] himself and are being kept burning as a part of the ritual continuously, and that is for the last 700 years.&lt;ref&gt;

At the very beginning of his work to establish [[Hindu]] [[Krishna]] temples in the Western World [[Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] wanted to establish a prominent temple in [[New York City]] dedicated to Bala Krishna, even before starting [[ISKCON]] he wrote to one of his supporters in India:&lt;ref name = Sdg&gt;{{cite book | first =Satsvarupa dasa| last   =Goswami| url = http://www.sdgonline.org| title =Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta Vol 1-2| publisher = GN Press | orig-year = 1980-82 |year=2002| isbn = 0-89213-357-0 | page = Ch.13 "Struggling Alone"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">'''Bryan Houghton''' (1911-1992) was an English Catholic priest.

==Youth and conversion==

Bryan Houghton was born into a wealthy British [[Anglican]] family. When he was very young he was sent to a boarding school in France. At the age of nine he had a Catholic friend who became an influence on his life.

Houghton said that in Protestant churches they talk about Jesus and his friend replied: "That's it, it talks about Jesus. They were surely very beautiful. But this is not the Mass. Mass is Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;[rejected Priest, DMM, p. 15]
&lt;/ref&gt; This prospect branded Houghton's life and leaded years later to convert to [[Roman Catholicism]]. Two years later, he went to Rome to become a priest.

==Priest, but isolated==

Houghton was ordained on 30 March 1940 and will be for 29 years pastor of two parishes near London: first appointed to [[Slough]] in a popular neighborhood, he created the Saint Anthony Parish, and organized a prayerful and fervent community.

In September 1954, he was sent to [[Bury St Edmunds]] and as priest takes charge of the parish. There he faced, from the early 1960s, to the action of some Catholic "reformers" whose objectived to empty the Catholic religion of its substance, claiming the will of the council. On 29 November 1969, Advent Sunday, he resigned from his pastor charge, refusing to be incorrect to impose liturgical practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amdg.asso.fr/formation/format_souffrancelaics_bhoughton.htm amdg.asso.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; With a personal fortune through inheritance, he decided to settle in the south of France, whose place he knew since his youth. The south beginning where there are olive trees, he settled in the region of Viviers. Houghton purchased a property and a chapel (Our Lady of the Rose) in which, with the permission of the bishop, he will continue to celebrate the [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine form of the Roman rite]] until his death on 19 November 1992. He rests in the cemetery of [[Viviers (Ardèche)]].

==Committed writer==

By the 1960s, he speaks regularly at conferences and in journals by incisive interventions, to give evidence of "conversion by the Mass."

Rooted in fidelity to the Pope and the Old Mass, Father Hougthon was far from following Monsignor [[Marcel Lefebvre]] and his first book, The Peace of Monsignor Forester in 1982, marked his distance from the founder of [[Society of Saint Pius X]]. This novel contained "liturgical peace proposals," which, if they were not followed by immediate effect, are quite similar to the situation in late 2006. He became a good friend of the Barroux Monastery.

In one of his articles he devoted a book of Cardinal Ratzinger, and Houghton wrote to the cardinal in 1986, saying: "There is no doubt that he has the makings of a great man."

'''Buddhism in Thailand''' is largely of the [[Theravada]] school, which is followed by 94.6 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/th.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703193043/https://www.cia.gov/Library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/th.html|archive-date=2015-07-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] in [[Thailand]] has also become integrated with [[folk religion]] as well as Chinese religions from the large [[Thai Chinese]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CIA World Factbook: Thailand |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |date=2007-02-08 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/th.html |accessdate=2007-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703193043/https://www.cia.gov/Library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/th.html |archive-date=2015-07-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Lamphun's Little-Known Animal Shrines' in: Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David, ''Ancient Chiang Mai'' Volume 1. Chiang Mai ,Cognoscenti Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thai temple art and architecture|Buddhist temples in Thailand]] are characterized by tall golden [[stupa]]s, and the [[Buddhist architecture]] of Thailand is similar to that in other Southeast Asian countries, particularly [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]], with which Thailand shares cultural and historical heritage.

Buddhism is believed to have come to what is now [[History of Thailand|Thailand]] as early as 250 [[Common Era|BCE]], in the time of Indian Emperor [[Ashoka]]. Since then, Buddhism has played a significant role in Thai culture and society. Buddhism and the [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thai monarchy]] has often been intertwined, with Thai kings historically seen as the main [[Patronage|patrons]] of Buddhism in Thailand. Although politics and religion were generally [[Separation of church and state|separated]] for most of Thai history, Buddhism's connection to the Thai state would increase in the middle of the 19th century following the reforms of [[Mongkut|King Mongkut]], that would lead to the development of a royally backed sect of Buddhism and increased centralization of the Thai [[Sangha]] under the state, with state control over Buddhism increasing further after the [[2014 Thai coup d'état|2014 coup d'etat]]. 

Thai Buddhism is distinguished for its emphasis on short term [[ordination]] for every Thai man and its close interconnection with the Thai state and Thai culture. The two official branches, or [[Nikāya#Monastic divisions|Nikayas]], of Thai Buddhism are the royally backed [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]] and the larger [[Maha Nikaya]].

== Historical background ==
[[File:Thailandia, bodhisattva maitreya da prakon chai, viii sec.JPG|thumb|upright|Thai depiction of [[Maitreya]] [[Bodhisattva]]. 8th century CE]]

=== Early traditions ===
Some scholars believe that Buddhism must have been flowing into Thailand from India at the time of the Indian emperor [[Ashoka]] of the [[Maurya Empire]] and into the first millennium after Christ.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Some Aspects of Asian History and Culture"  by Upendra Thakur p.157&lt;/ref&gt; During the 5th to 13th centuries, [[Southeast Asia]]n empires were influenced directly from India and followed [[Mahayana]] Buddhism. The [[Chinese people|Chinese]] pilgrim [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] noted in his travels that in these areas, all major sects of Indian Buddhism flourished.&lt;ref name="Sujato, Bhikkhu 2006. p. 72"&gt;Sujato, Bhikkhu. ''Sects &amp; Sectarianism: The Origins of Buddhist Schools.'' 2006. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; [[Srivijaya]] to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence and their art expressed the rich Mahāyāna pantheon of [[bodhisattva]]s. From the 9th to the 13th centuries, the Mahāyāna and Hindu Khmer Empire dominated much of the Southeast Asian peninsula. Under the Khmer Empire, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand.

After the [[decline of Buddhism in India]], missions of Sinhalese monks gradually converted the [[Mon people]] and the [[Pyu city-states]] from [[Ari Buddhism]] to Theravāda and over the next two centuries also brought Theravāda Buddhism to the [[Bamar people]], Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, where it supplanted previous forms of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gombrich|first1=Richard F.|title=Theravāda Buddhism : a social history from ancient Benares to modern Colombo|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-36509-3|page=3|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theravada Buddhism was made the state religion only with the establishment of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=hb /&gt;

=== 13th–19th centuries ===
The details of the history of Buddhism in Thailand from the 13th to the 19th century are obscure, in part because few historical records or religious texts survived the Burmese destruction of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]], the capital city of the kingdom, in 1767. The anthropologist-historian [[S. J. Tambiah]], however, has suggested a general pattern for that era, at least with respect to the relations between Buddhism and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] on the one hand and the king on the other hand. In Thailand, as in other Theravada Buddhist kingdoms, the king was in principle thought of as patron and protector of the religion (sasana) and the sangha, while sasana and the sangha were considered in turn the treasures of the polity and the signs of its legitimacy. Religion and polity, however, remained separate domains, and in ordinary times the organizational links between the sangha and the king were not close.&lt;ref name=hb /&gt;

Among the chief characteristics of Thai kingdoms and principalities in the centuries before 1800 were the tendency to expand and contract, problems of succession, and the changing scope of the king's authority. In effect, some Thai kings had greater power over larger territories, others less, and almost invariably a king who sought successfully to expand his power also exercised greater control over the sangha. That control was coupled with greater support and patronage of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. When a king was weak, however, protection and supervision of the sangha also weakened, and the sangha declined. This fluctuating pattern appears to have continued until the emergence of the [[Chakri Dynasty]] in the last quarter of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=hb /&gt;

=== Modern era ===
[[File:Monk chants paritta to Siamese women.gif|thumb|Buddhist monk chants paritta to a group of Siamese women in 1900.]]
By the 19th century, and especially with the coming to power in 1851 of King [[Mongkut]], who had been a [[monk]] himself for twenty-seven years, the sangha, like the kingdom, became steadily more centralized and hierarchical in nature and its links to the state more institutionalized. As a monk, Mongkut was a distinguished scholar of Pali Buddhist scripture. Moreover, at that time the immigration of numbers of monks from Burma was introducing the more rigorous discipline characteristic of the Mon sangha. Influenced by the Mon and guided by his own understanding of the Tipitaka, Mongkut began a reform movement that later became the basis for the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya|Dhammayuttika order]] of monks. Under the reform, all practices having no authority other than custom were to be abandoned, canonical regulations were to be followed not mechanically but in spirit, and acts intended to improve an individual's standing on the road to nirvana but having no social value were rejected. This more rigorous discipline was adopted in its entirety by only a small minority of monasteries and monks. The [[Maha Nikaya|Mahanikaya]] order, perhaps somewhat influenced by Mongkut's reforms but with a less exacting discipline than the Dhammayuttika order, comprised about 95 percent of all monks in 1970 and probably about the same percentage in the late 1980s. In any case, Mongkut was in a position to regularize and tighten the relations between monarchy and sangha at a time when the monarchy was expanding its control over the country in general and developing the kind of bureaucracy necessary to such control. The administrative and sangha reforms that Mongkut started were continued by his successor. In 1902 King Chulalongkorn (Rama V, 1868–1910) made the new sangha hierarchy formal and permanent through the Sangha Law of 1902, which remained the foundation of sangha administration in modern Thailand.&lt;ref name="hb"&gt;Tuchrello, William P.

====Statistics====
Approximately 94 percent of Thailand's population is Buddhist (five percent Muslim).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Major Religions in Thailand |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/religious-beliefs-in-thailand.html |website=worldatlas |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Asof|2016}} Thailand had 39,883 ''[[wat]]s'' (temples).

== Influences ==
{{See also|Thai folklore}}
[[File:The entrance gate of Wat Phra That Lampang Luang.JPG|Detail of the entrance gate of [[Wat Phra That Lampang Luang]]|thumb]]
Three major forces have influenced the development of Buddhism in Thailand. The most visible influence is that of the [[Theravada]] school of Buddhism, imported from [[Sri Lanka]]. While there are significant local and regional variations, the Theravada school provides most of the major themes of Thai Buddhism. By tradition, [[Pali|Pāli]] is the language of religion in Thailand. Scriptures are recorded in Pāli, using either the modern Thai script or the older [[Khmer alphabet|Khom]] and Tham scripts. Pāli is also used in religious liturgy, despite the fact that most Thais understand very little of this ancient language. The Pāli [[Tripiṭaka|Tipiṭaka]] is the primary religious text of Thailand, though many local texts have been composed in order to summarise the vast number of teachings found in the Tipiṭaka. The monastic code ([[Patimokkha|Pātimokkha]]) followed by Thai [[bhikkhu|monks]] is taken from the Pāli Theravada Canon.

The second major influence on Thai Buddhism is [[Hinduism|Hindu]] beliefs received from [[Cambodia]], particularly during the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]]. Hinduism played a strong role in the early Thai institution of kingship, just as it did in Cambodia, and exerted influence in the creation of laws and order for Thai society as well as Thai religion. Certain rituals practiced in modern Thailand, either by monks or by Hindu ritual specialists, are either explicitly identified as Hindu in origin, or are easily seen to be derived from Hindu practices. While the visibility of Hinduism in Thai society has been diminished substantially during the [[Chakri Dynasty]], Hindu influences, particularly shrines to the god [[Brahma]], continue to be seen in and around Buddhist institutions and ceremonies.
[[File:EveningPrayers01a.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bhikkhu]] chants evening prayers inside a monastery located near the town of Kantharalak, [[Thailand]]]]
[[Thai folklore|Folk religion]]—attempts to propitiate and attract the favor of local spirits known as ''[[ghosts in Thai culture|phi]]''—forms the third major influence on Thai Buddhism. While Western observers (as well as Western-educated Thais) have often drawn a clear line between Thai Buddhism and folk religious practices, this distinction is rarely observed in more rural locales. Spiritual power derived from the observance of Buddhist precepts and rituals is employed in attempting to appease local nature spirits. Many restrictions observed by rural Buddhist monks are derived not from the orthodox [[Vinaya]], but from taboos derived from the practice of folk magic. [[Astrology]], [[numerology]], and the creation of [[Amulet|talismans]] and charms also play a prominent role in Buddhism as practiced by the average Thai—practices that are censured by the Buddha in Buddhist texts (see [[Digha Nikaya]] 2, ff).

Additionally, more minor influences can be observed stemming from contact with [[Mahayana]] Buddhism. Early Buddhism in Thailand is thought to have been derived from an unknown Mahayana tradition. While Mahayana Buddhism was gradually eclipsed in Thailand, certain features of Thai Buddhism—such as the appearance of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Avalokiteśvara|Lokeśvara]] in some Thai religious architecture, and the belief that the king of Thailand is a bodhisattva himself—reveal the influence of Mahayana concepts.
[[File:Hotei in Thailand.JPG|left|thumb|[[Budai]], Wat Don Phra Chao, Yasothon, Thailand]] The only other bodhisattva prominent in Thai religion is [[Maitreya]], often depicted in [[Budai]] form, and often confused with [[Katyayana (Buddhist)|Phra Sangkajai]] ({{lang-th|พระสังกัจจายน์}}), a similar but different figure in Thai Buddhist folklore. Images of one or both can be found in many Thai Buddhist temples, and on amulets as well. Thai may pray to be reborn during the time of Maitreya, or dedicate [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] from worship activities to that end.

In modern times, additional Mahayana influence has stemmed from the presence of [[Overseas Chinese]] in Thai society. While some Chinese have "converted" to Thai-style Theravada Buddhism, many others maintain their own separate temples in the East Asian Mahayana tradition. The growing popularity of [[Guanyin]], a form of Avalokiteśvara, may be attributed to the Chinese presence in Thailand.

== Government ties ==
While Thailand is a [[constitutional monarchy]], it inherited a strong Southeast Asian tradition of [[Buddhist kingship]] that tied the legitimacy of the state to its protection and support for Buddhist institutions. This connection has been maintained into the modern era, with Buddhist institutions and clergy being granted special benefits by the government, as well as being subjected to a certain amount of governmental oversight. Part of the [[coronation of the Thai monarch]] includes the king proceeding to the chapel royal (the [[Wat Phra Kaew]]) to vow to be a "defender of the faith" in front of a chapter of monks including the [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand]].{{CN|date=September 2017}}

In addition to the ecclesiastical leadership of the ''sangha'', a secular government ministry supervises Buddhist temples and monks. The legal status of Buddhist sects and reform movements has been an issue of contention in some cases, particularly in the case of [[Santi Asoke]], which was legally forbidden from calling itself a Buddhist denomination, and in the case of the ordination of women attempting to revive the Theravada [[bhikkhuni]] lineage have been prosecuted for attempting to impersonate members of the clergy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

To obtain a passport for travel abroad, a monk must have an official letter from [[Sangha Supreme Council]] granting the applicant permission to travel abroad; Buddhist monk identification card; a copy of house or temple registration; and submit any previous Thai passport or a certified copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/services/1415/21482-e-Passport-Application-for-Thai-Nationals-Living-A.html |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs – required documents |access-date=2015-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709010323/http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/services/1415/21482-e-Passport-Application-for-Thai-Nationals-Living-A.html |archive-date=2015-07-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to state support and recognition—in the form of formal gifts to monasteries made by government officials and the royal family (for example, [[Kathin]])—-a number of special rights are conferred upon Buddhist monks. They are granted free passage on public transportation, and most train stations and airports have special seating sections reserved for members of the clergy. Conversely, ordained monastics are forbidden from standing for office or voting in elections.

=== Calls for state religion===
In 2007, calls were made by some Buddhist groups for Buddhism to be recognized in the new national constitution as the state religion. This suggestion was initially rejected by the committee charged with drafting the new constitution.&lt;ref name="bccon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=52,3969,0,0,1,0|website=The Buddhist Channel|title=Thai Buddhists call for top status 'unnecessary'|accessdate=2007-04-18|date=18 April 2007|author=Charoensuthipan, Penchan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509073704/http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=52,3969,0,0,1,0|archive-date=2007-05-09|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This move prompted protests from supporters of the initiative, including a number of marches on the capital and a hunger strike by twelve Buddhist monks.&lt;ref name="gtart"&gt;[http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=154565&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=45&amp;parent_id=25 Monks push for Buddhism to be named Thailand's religion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616082151/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=154565&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=45&amp;parent_id=25 |date=16 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of the plan, including scholar and social critic [[Sulak Sivaraksa]], claimed that the movement to declare Buddhism the national religion is motivated by political gain, manipulated by supporters of ousted Prime Minister [[Thaksin Sinawatra|Thaksin Shinawatra]].&lt;ref name="gtart" /&gt;
The Constitution Drafting Committee later voted against the special status of Buddhism, provoking religious groups. They condemned the committee and the draft constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Prapasri |last=Osathanon |author2=Nerisa Nerykhiew |title=Drafters reject Buddhism as State Religion|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=5&amp;id=30038509 |work=The Nation|date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2007-08-18|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095857/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=5&amp;id=30038509 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 August 2007, [[Sirikit]], the Queen of Thailand, expressed her concern over the issue. She said, in her birthday speech, that Buddhism is beyond politics. Some Buddhist organizations halted their campaigns the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Buddhist groups, monks halt campaigns against draft charter |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=35&amp;id=30044738 |work=The Nation|date=2007-08-12|accessdate=2007-08-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105524/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=35&amp;id=30044738 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government service ===

No law directly prohibits a member of the Buddhist institutions, such as a monk, a novice and a nun, from being a candidate in an examination for recruitment of government officers. Though both the [[Cabinet of Thailand|Council of Ministers]] and the [[Sangha Supreme Council]], the supervising body of the Thai Buddhist communities, have ordered such prohibition on grounds of appropriateness, according to the Memorandum of the Cabinet's Administrative Department No. NW98/2501 dated 27 June 1958 and the Order of the Sangha Supreme Council dated 17 March 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title = th:ประกาศสำนักงานสภาความมั่นคงแห่งชาติ ลงวันที่ 21 พฤศจิกายน 2556 | trans-title = Announcement of the National Security Council Office dated 21 November 2013 | format = PDF | language = Thai | publisher = National Security Council | date = Dec 2013 | accessdate = 2014-01-22 | location = Bangkok | url = http://job.ocsc.go.th/images/Job/635210644028315860.pdf | title = Archived copy | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131207023255/http://job.ocsc.go.th/images/Job/635210644028315860.pdf# | archive-date = 2013-12-07 | dead-url = bot: unknown | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elections ===

The members of the Buddhist community and the communities of other religions are not entitled to elect or be elected as a holder of any government post. For instance, the [[2007 constitution of Thailand]] disfranchises "a Buddhist monk, a Buddhist novice, a priest or a clergy member" ({{lang-th|"ภิกษุ สามเณร นักบวช หรือนักพรต"}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Section 100 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand, Buddhist Era 2550 (2007) | publisher = Asian Legal Information Institute | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2014-01-22 | url = http://www.asianlii.org/th/legis/const/2007/1.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120515162053/http://www.asianlii.org/th/legis/const/2007/1.html | archivedate = 2012-05-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sangha Supreme Council also declared the same prohibition, pursuant to its Order dated 17 March 1995.&lt;ref name="sanook"&gt;{{cite web|script-title=th:หมายเหตุคำสั่งมหาเถรสมาคม พ.ศ. 2538 |trans-title=A statement of grounds attached to the 1995 Order of the Sangha Supreme Council |language=Thai |publisher=Sanook! |author=Matichon |date=2007-06-16 |accessdate=2014-01-22 |url=http://news.sanook.com/scoop/0/scoop_146637.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202164022/http://news.sanook.com/scoop/0/scoop_146637.php |archivedate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Order was a statement of grounds given by [[Nyanasamvara Suvaddhana|Nyanasamvara]], the [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand|Supreme Patriarch]]. The statement said:

{{quote|The members of the Buddhist community are called ''[[Śramaṇa|samaṇa]]'', one who is pacified, and also ''pabbajita'', one who refrains from worldly activities. They are thus needed to carefully conduct themselves in a peaceful and unblamable manner, for their own sake and for the sake of their community. ... The seeking of the representatives of the citizens to form the House of Representatives is purely the business of the State and specifically the duty of the laity according to the laws. This is not the duty of the monks and novices who must be above the politics. They are therefore not entitled to elect or be elected. And, for this reason, any person who has been elected as a Representative will lose his membership immediately after becoming a Buddhist monk or novice. This indicates that the monkhood and noviceship are not appropriate for politics in every respect.&lt;ref name="sanook" /&gt;}}

{{quote|When a monk or novice is involved in or supports an election of any person..., the monk or novice is deemed to have breached the unusual conduct of ''pabbajita'' and brought about disgrace to himself as well as his community and the Religion. Such a monk or novice would be condemned by the reasonable persons who are and are not the members of this Religion. A ''pabbajita'' is therefore expected to stay in impartiality and take a pity on every person...without discrimination. Moreover, the existence of both the monks and the Religion relies upon public respect. As a result, the monks and novices ought to behave in such a way that deserves respect of the general public, not merely a specific group of persons. A monk or novice who is seen by the public as having failed to uphold this rule would then be shunned, disrespected and condemned in various manners, as could be seen from many examples.&lt;ref name="sanook" /&gt;}}

Buddhism in Thailand came under greater state control following the [[2014 Thai coup d'état|2014 coup d'état]]. After seizing power the [[Military dictatorship|military junta]], the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (NCPO), set up a National Reform Council with a religious committee led by former Thai senator Paiboon Nititawan and former monk [[Mano Laohavanich]].

As in most other [[Theravada]] nations, Buddhism in Thailand is represented primarily by the presence of Buddhist monks, who serve as [[wikt:officiant|officiants]] on ceremonial occasions, as well as being responsible for preserving and conveying the teachings of the Buddha.

During the latter half of the 20th century, most monks in Thailand began their careers by serving as [[temple boy]]s ({{lang-th|เด็กวัด}} ''dek wat'', "[[child]]ren of the [[wat]]"). Temple boys are traditionally no younger than eight and do minor housework. The primary reason for becoming a temple boy is to gain a basic [[Education in Thailand|education]], particularly in basic reading and writing and the memorization of the scriptures chanted on ritual occasions. Prior to the creation of state-run primary schools in Thailand, village temples served as the primary form of education for most Thai boys. Service in a temple as a temple boy was a necessary prerequisite for attaining any higher education, and was the only learning available to most Thai peasants. Since the creation of a government-run educational apparatus in Thailand, the number of children living as temple boys has declined significantly. However, many government-run schools continue to operate on the premises of the local village temple.

Boys now typically ordain as a [[śrāmaṇera|sāmaṇera]] or novitiate monks ({{lang-th|สามเณร}} ''samanen'', often shortened to ''nen'' {{lang-th|เณร}}). In some localities, girls may become [[Śrāmaṇerī|sāmaṇerī]]. Novices live according to the [[Ten Precepts (Buddhism)|Ten Precepts]] but are not required to follow the full range of monastic rules found in the [[Prātimokṣa|Pātimokkha]]. There are a few other significant differences between novices and [[bhikkhu]]s. Novices often are in closer contact with their families, spending more time in the homes of their parents than monks. Novices do not participate in the recitation of the monastic code (and the confessions of violations) that take place on the [[uposatha]] days. Novices technically do not eat with the monks in their temple, but this typically only amounts to a gap in seating, rather than the separation observed between monks and the laity. Novices usually ordain during a break from secular schooling, but those intending on a religious life, may receive secular schooling at the wat.

[[File:Novice monks in Thailand.jpg|thumb|Child monks in Thailand]]

Young men typically do not live as a novice for longer than one or two years. At the age of 20, they become eligible to receive [[upasampada]], the higher ordination that establishes them as a full bhikkhu. A novice is technically sponsored by his parents in his ordination, but in practice in rural villages the entire village participates by providing the robes, alms bowl, and other requisites that will be required by the monk in his monastic life.

Temporary ordination is the norm among Thai Buddhists. Most young men traditionally ordain for the term of a single [[vassa]] or rainy season (Thai ''phansa''). Those who remain monks beyond their first vassa typically remain monks for between one and three years, officiating at religious ceremonies in surrounding villages and possibly receiving further education in reading and writing (possibly including the [[Khmer alphabet|Khom]] or [[Tai Tham alphabet]]s traditionally used in recording religious texts). After this period of one to three years, most young monks return to secular life, going on to marry and start a family. Young men in Thailand who have undergone ordination are seen as being more suitable partners for marriage; unordained men are euphemistically called "unripe", while those who have been ordained are said to be "ripe". A period as a monk is a prerequisite for many positions of leadership within the village hierarchy. Most village elders or headmen were once monks, as were most traditional doctors, spirit priests, and some astrologists and fortune tellers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In a country where most males can be ordained as monks for even short periods of time, the experience can be profitable. The Thai musician, Pisitakun Kuantalaeng, became a monk for a short period following the death of his father in order to make merit. He observed that, "Being a monk is good money,...When you go and pray you get 300 baht [about £7] even though you have no living expenses, and you can go four times a day. Too many monks in Thailand do it to get rich. If you become a monk for three months you have enough money for a scooter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watling|first1=Eve|title=Noise As Abstraction: Fuzzing The Limits Of Free Speech In Thailand|journal=The Quietus|date=3 March 2018|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/24151-pisitakun-kuantalaeng-thailand-noise-artist|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monks who do not return to secular life typically specialize in either scholarship or meditation. Those who specialize in scholarship typically travel to regional education centers to begin further instruction in the Pāli language and the scriptures, and may then continue on to the major monastic universities in [[Bangkok]]. The scholarship route is also followed by monks who desire to rise in the ecclesiastic hierarchy, as promotions within the government-run system are contingent on passing examinations in Pāli and [[Sanam Luang Dhamma Studies|Dhamma studies]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The Thai tradition supports laymen to go into a monastery, dress and act as monks, and study while there. The time line is based on threes, staying as a monk for three days, or three weeks, or three months or three years, or three weeks and three days. This retreat is expected of all Thai males, rich or poor, and often is scheduled after high school. Such retreats bring honor to the family and blessings (merit) to the young man. Thais make allowances for men who follow this practice, such as holding open a job.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Health issues===
Rising obesity among monks&lt;ref name="NYT-20180812"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Suhartono |first1=Muktita |title=In Thailand, 'Obesity in Our Monks Is a Ticking Time Bomb' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/12/world/asia/thailand-monks-obesity.html |accessdate=3 September 2018 |work=New York Times |date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concerns for their well-being has become an issue in Thailand. A study by the [[Ministry of Public Health (Thailand)|Health Ministry]] in 2017 of 200 Bangkok temples found that 60 percent of monks suffer from high cholesterol and 50 percent from [[Hyperglycemia|high blood sugar]].&lt;ref name="BP-2018-09-03"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pisuthipan |first1=Arusa |title=The robes are getting tight |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/lifestyle/social-and-lifestyle/1533086/the-robes-are-getting-tight |accessdate=3 September 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public health experts attribute this to two factors. First, monks are required to accept and eat whatever is given to them on their daily alms rounds. Second, monks are not permitted to engage in cardiovascular exercise as it is undignified. Monks eat only two meals per day, breakfast and lunch. But the remainder of the day they are allowed to drink ''nam pana'', which includes the juice of fruit less than fist-sized, often high in sugar. To combat the high rate of [[non-communicable disease]]s among monks, the National Health Commission Office (NHCO) issued a pamphlet, ''National Health Charter for Monks'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saeiew |first1=Khanitta |title=Health Charter for Buddhist Monks, established healthy monks, temples and happy communities in 10 years |url=https://en.nationalhealth.or.th/health-charter-buddhist-monks-established-healthy-monks-temples-happy-communities-10-years/ |website=National Health Commission Office (Thailand) |accessdate=3 September 2018 |ref=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to educate monks and [[wikt:layperson|laypeople]] alike as to healthy eating habits.&lt;ref name="BP-2018-09-03"/&gt;

There have been cases of influential monks persecuted and jailed by the Thai government, through verdicts later declared moot or controversial. A well-known case in Thailand is that of Phra Phimontham, then abbot of [[Wat Mahadhatu]], known in Thailand for having introduced the Burmese [[Satipatthana]] meditation method to Thailand. In 1962, during the [[Cold War]], he was accused of collaboration with communist rebels and being a threat to national security, and was fully [[defrocked]] and jailed. In fact, the government persecuted him because of his political views and promotion of changes in the Sangha. Phra Phimontham had strong pro-democratic leanings, which did not comport well with the regime of the day nor the palace. Furthermore, Phra Phimontham was part of the [[Maha Nikaya]] fraternity, rather than the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya|Dhammayuttika fraternity]], which the government and monarchy historically have preferred. Phra Phimontham was likely to become the next [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand|supreme patriarch]].&lt;ref name="ScottRM-2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Rachelle M|title=Nirvana for Sale?

In March 2016, Thai police formally summoned then Acting Supreme Patriarch Somdet Chuang Varapunno, after he refused to answer direct questions about his [[vintage car]], one of only 65 made. The car was part of a museum kept at [[Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen]] in Bangkok, but has now been seized by police investigating possible tax evasion. Somdet reportedly transferred ownership of the vehicle to another monk after the scandal broke. He refused to answer police questions directly, insisting that written questions be sent to his lawyer. He did say that the car was a gift from a follower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-29/head-thai-monk-to-be-summoned-by-police-over-1958-mercedes-benz/7272536|title=Thailand's head monk to be summoned by police over luxury Mercedes-Benz|date=2016-03-29|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|location=Sydney|last1=Cochrane|first1=Liam|accessdate=30 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329130537/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-29/head-thai-monk-to-be-summoned-by-police-over-1958-mercedes-benz/7272536|archive-date=2016-03-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts from different news outlets have pointed out that the actions of the Thai government towards Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen may have reflected a political need to control who should be selected as the next [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand|Supreme Patriarch]], since Somdet had already been proposed as a candidate by the [[Sangha Supreme Council]]. Selecting him would mean a Supreme Patriarch from the Maha Nikaya fraternity, rather than the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya|Dhammayuttika fraternity]], which historically has always been the preferred choice of the Thai government and the monarchy.&lt;ref name="McCargo-2012" /&gt;{{rp|638}} In fact, Somdet Chuang's nomination was postponed and eventually withdrawn after the Thai government changed the law in December 2016 to allow King Vajiralongkorn to appoint the Supreme Patriarch directly, with Prime Minister [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]] countersigning, leading to the appointment of a monk from the Dhammayuttika fraternity instead.&lt;ref name="New 2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUEM6LGZywA|date=27 December 2016|work=New TV|language=th|script-title=สัมภาษณ์สด เจ้าคุณประสาร-ส.ศิวรักษ์ แก้พรบ.สงฆ์|trans-title=Live interview with Chao Khun Prasarn and S.

== Reform movements ==
* The [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]] ({{lang-th|ธรรมยุตนิกาย}}) began in 1833 as a reform movement led by Prince [[Mongkut]], son of King [[Rama II of Siam]]. It remained a reform movement until passage of the Sangha Act of 1902, which formally recognized it as the lesser of Thailand's two Theravada denominations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhammathai.org/e/thailand/contemperary.php Buddhism in Contemporary Thailand] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401214429/http://www.dhammathai.org/e/thailand/contemperary.php |date=2015-04-01 }}, Prof. Phra Thepsophon, Rector of Mahachulalongkorn Buddhist University.

In 1836 he became the first [[abbot]] of [[Wat Bowonniwet Vihara]]. After the then 20-year-old prince entered monastic life in 1824, he noticed what he saw as serious discrepancies between the rules given in the [[Pāli Canon]] and the actual practices of Thai bhikkhus and sought to upgrade monastic discipline to make it more orthodox. Mongkut also made an effort to remove all non-Buddhist, [[Folk religion|folk religious]], and superstitious elements which over the years had become part of Thai Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhammathai.org/e/thailand/ratanakosin.php Ratanakosin Period] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521235806/http://www.dhammathai.org/e/thailand/ratanakosin.php |date=2015-05-21 }}, Buddhism in Thailand, Dhammathai – Buddhist Information Network&lt;/ref&gt; Dhammayuttika monks were expected to eat only one meal a day (not two) that was to be gathered during a traditional [[alms]] round.

The movement opposes traditional magical rituals, superstition, folk religious practices, fortune telling and giving lottery numbers, and focuses on an active style of propagating and practicing meditation. Features of the tradition include teaching meditation in a group, teaching meditation during ceremonies, teaching meditation simultaneously to monastics and lay people, teaching one main meditation method and an emphasis on lifelong ordination.&lt;ref name="Newell-2008" /&gt;

* The [[Santi Asoke]] ({{lang-th|สันติอโศก}} "Peaceful [[Ashoka#Embrace of Buddhism|Asoka]]") or Chao Asok ("People of Asoka") was established by Phra Bodhirak after he "declared independence from the Ecclesiastical Council (Sangha) in 1975".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Man behind Santi Asoke | author= Sanitsuda Ekachai|url = http://www.bunniyom.com/insight2_the%20man%20behind%20santi%20asoke.html | accessdate = 13 July 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712102438/http://www.bunniyom.com/insight2_the%20man%20behind%20santi%20asoke.html|archivedate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santi Asoke has been described as "a transformation of the "forest monk" revival of [the 1920s and 1930s]" and "is more radical [than the Dhammakaya Movement] in its criticism of Thai society and in the details of its own vision of what constitutes a truly religiomoral community."&lt;ref name=Fun /&gt;

* The Sekhiya Dhamma Sangha are a group of activist monks focusing on modern issues in Thailand (i.e., deforestation, poverty, drug addiction, and AIDS).

== Position of women ==
{{See also|Women in Buddhism|Criticism of Buddhism#Women in Buddhism|Women and religion}}
[[File:Thai Buddhist child is sitting the concentration happily.jpg|thumb|Although women in Thailand traditionally cannot ordain as [[bhikkhuni]], they can choose to take part in quasi-monastic practices at temples and practice centers as [[maechi]].]]
Unlike in [[Burma]] and [[Sri Lanka]], the [[bhikkhuni]] lineage of women monastics was never established in Thailand. Women primarily participate in religious life either as lay participants in collective merit-making rituals or by doing domestic work around temples. A small number of women choose to become [[maechi]], non-ordained religious specialists who permanently observe either the [[Five Precepts#Eight Precepts|Eight]] or [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|Ten Precepts]]. Maechi do not receive the level of support given to bhikkhu and their position in Thai society is the subject of some discussion.

There have been efforts to attempt to introduce a bhikkhuni lineage in Thailand as a step towards improving the position of women in Thai Buddhism. The main proponent of this movement has been [[Dhammananda Bhikkhuni]].&lt;ref name=Willis&gt;{{cite web|last1=Willis|first1=Jan|title=Building a Place for the Theris|url=http://www.lionsroar.com/help-build-a-place-for-the-theris/|website=Lion's Roar|date=2013-01-21|accessdate=21 Apr 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143020/http://www.lionsroar.com/help-build-a-place-for-the-theris/|archive-date=2015-04-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike similar efforts in Sri Lanka, these efforts have been extremely controversial in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kurz|first1=Sopaporn|title=Bhikkhuni says she is glum on future of ordination|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,4527,0,0,1,0|accessdate=21 Apr 2015|work=The Nation|publisher=The Buddhist Channel|date=2007-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923195215/http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,4527,0,0,1,0|archive-date=2015-09-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women attempting to ordain have been accused of attempting to impersonate monks (a civil offense in Thailand), and their actions have been denounced by many members of the ecclesiastic hierarchy.

In 1928 a secular law was passed in Thailand banning women's full ordination in Buddhism.

No one denies that men and women have an equal chance to attain enlightenment. In Mahayana Buddhism, practised in Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong, and Tibet, female ordinations are common, but in countries that adhere to the Theravada branch of the religion, such as Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Myanmar, women were banned from becoming ordained about eight centuries ago, "for fear that women entering monastic life instead of bearing children would be a disruption of social order", according to Kittipong Narit, a Buddhist scholar at Bangkok's Thammasat University.&lt;ref name=SCMP-20150510 /&gt;

Most objections to the reintroduction of a female monastic role hinge on the fact that the monastic rules require that both five ordained monks and five ordained bhikkhunis be present for any new bhikkhuni ordination. Without such a quorum, critics say that it is not possible to ordain any new Theravada bhikkhuni. The Thai hierarchy refuses to recognize ordinations in the [[Dharmaguptaka]] tradition (the only currently existing bhikkhuni ordination lineage) as valid Theravada ordinations, citing differences in philosophical teachings and, more critically, monastic discipline.

[[File:catherinebooth.jpg|thumb|right|Catherine Booth]]
{{The Salvation Army}}
'''Catherine Booth''' (17 January 1829 &amp;ndash; 4 October 1890) was co-founder of [[The Salvation Army]], along with her husband [[William Booth]]. Because of her influence in the formation of The Salvation Army she was known as the 'Mother of The Salvation Army'.

== Life ==

She was born as '''Catherine Mumford''' in [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire]], England, in 1829 to Methodist parents, John Mumford and Sarah Milward. Her father was an occasional lay preacher and carriage maker. Her family later moved to [[Boston, Lincolnshire]], and later lived in [[Brixton]], [[London]]. From an early age, Catherine was a serious and sensitive girl. She had a strong [[Christianity|Christian]] upbringing and was said to have read the [[Bible]] through eight times before the age of 12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf/vw-dynamic-index/25C93B05B881107A852574420043CC58?Opendocument "Catherine Booth" at The Salvation Army] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415181351/http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf/vw-dynamic-index/25C93B05B881107A852574420043CC58?Opendocument |date=15 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Catherine’s adolescence a spinal curvature led to years of enforced idleness.&lt;ref name=parkin/&gt; She kept herself busy, however, and was especially concerned about the problems of [[alcoholism]]. Even as a young girl she had served as secretary of a Juvenile Temperance Society writing articles for a temperance [[magazine]]. Catherine was a member of the local [[Hope UK|Band of Hope]] and a supporter of the national [[Temperance movement|Temperance Society]].

When Catherine refused to condemn Methodist Reformers in 1850, the Wesleyans expelled her. For the Reformers she led a girls’ Sunday school class in Clapham. At the home of Edward Rabbits, in 1851, she met William Booth, who also had been expelled by the Wesleyans for reform sympathies. William was reciting a temperance poem, “The Grog-seller’s Dream,” which appealed to Catherine, who had embraced the new Methodist passion for abstinence.&lt;ref name=murdoch&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1990/issue26/2605b.html Murdoch, Norman H., "The Army Mother", ''Christian History Magazine'', Issue 26: William and Catherine Booth: Salvation Army Founders (1990) Christianity Today ]&lt;/ref&gt;

They soon fell in love and became engaged. During their three-year engagement, Catherine constantly wrote letters of encouragement to William as he performed the tiring work of a preacher. They were married on 16 July 1855&lt;ref&gt;[https://salvos.org.au/about-us/our-story/our-history/founders-william-and-catherine-booth/ "Founders William &amp; Catherine Booth", Salvation Army, Australia Eastern Territory]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Stockwell]] Green [[Congregational]] Church in London. Their wedding was very simple, as they wanted to use their time and money for his ministry. Even on their honeymoon, William was asked to speak at meetings.

The Booths had eight children: [[Bramwell Booth]], [[Ballington Booth]], [[Kate Booth]], [[Emma Booth (The Salvation Army)|Emma Booth]], [[Herbert Booth]], [[Marie Booth]], [[Evangeline Booth]] and [[Lucy Booth]], and were dedicated to giving them a firm Christian knowledge. Two of their offspring, Bramwell and Evangeline, later became [[Generals of The Salvation Army]].

== Ministry ==
[[File:Booth2.jpg|thumb|Catherine and William Booth]]
Catherine began to be more active in the work of the church at [[Brighouse]]. Though she was extremely nervous, she enjoyed working with young people and found the courage to speak in children's meetings. During this period she discovered a model, American Wesleyan revivalist [[Phoebe Palmer]]. With William’s encouragement, Catherine wrote a pamphlet, ''Female Ministry: Woman’s Right to Preach the Gospel'' (1859), in defense of American preacher Mrs. Phoebe Palmer’s preaching, whose preaching had caused a great stir in the area where the Booths lived. ''Female Ministry'' was a short, powerful apology for women’s rights to preach the gospel.  The pamphlet identifies three major principles on which her convictions rested. First, Catherine saw that women are neither naturally nor morally inferior to men. Second, she believed there was no scriptural reason to deny them a public ministry. Third, she maintained that what the Bible urged, the Holy Spirit had ordained and blessed and so must be justified.&lt;ref name=parkin/&gt; She complained that the “unjustifiable application” of Paul’s advice, “ ‘Let your women keep silence in the Churches,’ has resulted in more loss to the Church, evil to the world, and dishonor to God, than any of [its] errors.”&lt;ref name=murdoch/&gt;

At that time, it was unheard of for women to speak in adult meetings. She was convinced that [[Christian feminism|women had an equal right to speak]]. In January 1860, following the birth of their fourth child, at [[Gateshead]], during William's sermon, she asked to "say a word". She witnessed to her timidity about claiming her calling, yet William announced that she would speak that night.&lt;ref name=murdoch/&gt; It was the beginning of a tremendous ministry, as people were greatly challenged by her preaching.

She became a partner in her husband’s work and soon found her own sphere as a powerful preacher. She also spoke to people in their homes, especially to [[alcoholic]]s, whom she helped to make a new start in life. Often she held cottage meetings for [[religious conversion|converts]]. She eventually began to hold her own campaigns. Many agree that no man of her era, including her husband, exceeded her in popularity or spiritual results. Her first written article, the phamphlet ''Female Teaching''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=2018 year book | publisher=Salvation Books | page=21 | isbn=9781911149408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in December 1859.

Catherine Booth was eloquent and compelling in speech, articulate and devastatingly logical in writing, she had for over twenty years defended the right of women to preach the gospel on the same terms as men. At first, Catherine and her husband had shared a ministry as traveling evangelists, but then she came into great demand as a preacher in her own right, especially among the well-to-do. A woman preacher was a rare phenomenon in a world where women had few civil rights, and no place in the professions. Catherine Booth was both a woman and a fine preacher, a magnetic combination that attracted large numbers to hear her and made its own statement about the validity of women’s ministry.&lt;ref name=parkin&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1990/issue26/2610.html Parkin, Major Christine, "Pioneer in Female Ministry", ''Christian History Magazine'', Issue 26: William and Catherine Booth: Salvation Army Founders (1990) Christianity Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst other activities, Catherine lobbied Queen Victoria to seek legislation for safeguarding females, in the form of the "Parliamentary Bill for the protection of girls"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Personal papers | publisher=The National Archives, UK | url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/nra/lists/gb-2133-sa.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Christian Mission ==
They began the work of The Christian Mission in 1865 in London's East End. William preached to the poor and ragged and Catherine spoke to the wealthy, gaining support for their financially demanding ministry. The textile industry employed as many women as men and contributed a substantial number of female officers. In addition, domestic indoor servants flocked to the Army, and many became officers.&lt;ref name=horridge&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1990/issue26/2614.html Horridge, Glenn K., "William Booth's Officers", ''Christian History Magazine'', Issue 26: William and Catherine Booth: Salvation Army Founders (1990) Christianity Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Appointments of Officers, 1883" lists 127 married men. This number is important, because wives were expected to help run the corps. Since wives were not compelled to attend the officers’ course at the Training Home, they were not given a commission and, therefore, did not appear in the list. General Booth had an active policy of encouraging officers to intermarry. The "Appointments of Officers, 1883" lists thirty-six couples who had done so, the women resigning their own rights of officership to become joint officers with their husbands. The loss of the women officers’ rights when marrying contradicts the constant statement regarding equality. The Army leaders were clearly not so radical as to lose the concept of man’s conjugal superiority. This social policy carried into pay; the husband, as head of the household, received the pay for the couple. The idea that single female officers could manage on less money than their male counterparts was abolished before the Second World War. Until that time, male officers received a third more pay than their female counterparts.&lt;ref name=horridge/&gt;

Catherine Booth organized Food for the Million shops where the poor could buy a cheap meal and at Christmas, hundreds of meals were distributed to the needy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derbyshireuk.net/booth.html "Famous Derbyshire People", Derbyshire, UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the name was changed in 1878 to [[The Salvation Army]] and [[William Booth]] became known as the [[Generals of The Salvation Army|General]], Catherine became known as the 'Mother of The Salvation Army.' She was behind many of the changes in the new organization, designing the flag and bonnets for the ladies, and contributed to the Army's ideas on many important issues and matters of belief.

The Booths rented a small villa, Crossley House, in [[Clacton-on-Sea]], which had a sea view that she loved.

Catherine Booth died of [[breast cancer]] at age 61 at Crossley House. She is interred with her husband in [[Abney Park Cemetery]], London.

Subsequently, Crossley House was donated to people with learning disabilities and provided many summer holidays until it was sold to property developers in 2005.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Christian interpretations of Virgil's ''Eclogue'' 4}}
[[File:Publius Vergilius Maro1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eclogue 4|''Eclogue'' 4]] was written by the Roman poet [[Virgil]] {{circa}} 42 BC. During the Middle Ages, some elevated Virgil as pre-Christian prophet, largely due to perceived prophetic nature of the poem.]]
[[Eclogue 4|''Eclogue'' 4]], also known as the Fourth ''Eclogue'' is the name of a Latin poem by the Roman poet [[Virgil]]. Part of his first major work, the ''[[Eclogues]]'', the piece was written around 40 BC, during a time of temporary stability following the [[Treaty of Brundisium]]; it was later published in and around the years 39–38 BC. The work describes the birth of a boy, a supposed savior, who once of age will become divine and eventually rule over the world. During late antiquity and the Middle Ages, a desire emerged to view Virgil as a [[virtuous pagan]], and as such, early Christians, such as Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], early Christian theologian [[Lactantius]], and [[St. Augustine]]{{em dash}}to varying degrees{{em dash}}reinterpreted the poem to be about the birth of [[Jesus Christ]].

This belief persisted into the Medieval era, with many scholars arguing that Virgil not only prophesied Christ prior to his birth but also that he was a pre-Christian prophet. [[Dante Alighieri]] included Virgil as a main character in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', and Michelangelo included the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] on the ceiling painting of the [[Sistine Chapel]] (a reference to the widespread belief that the Sibyl herself prophesied the birth of Christ, and Virgil used her prophecies to craft his poem). Modern scholars, such as [[Robin Nisbet]], tend to eschew this interpretation, arguing that seemingly Judeo-Christian elements of the poem can be explained through means other than divine prophecy.

==Background==
The scholarly consensus is that Virgil began the hexameter ''[[Eclogues]]'' (or ''Bucolics'') in 42 BC and it is thought that the collection was published around 39–8 BC (although this assertion is not without its detractors).&lt;ref name="Fowler, pg.1602"&gt;Fowler (1996), p. 1602.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Eclogues'' (from the Greek word for "selections") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry ("pastoral poetry") of the Hellenistic poet [[Theocritus]]. The [[Eclogue 4|fourth of these ''Eclogues'']] can be dated to around 40 BC, during a time when the [[Roman civil wars#Late Republic|Roman Civil]] war seemed to be coming to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Morwood (2008), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘’Eclogue’’ 4 largely concerns the birth of a child (''puer'') who will become divine and eventually rule over the world.&lt;ref name=rose114&gt;Rose (1924), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bourne391/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis (2010), p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Classicist H. J. Rose notes that the poem “is in a sense Messianic, since it contains a prophecy (whether meant seriously or not) of the birth of a wonder-child of more than mortal virtue and power, who shall restore the Golden Age.”&lt;ref name=rose113&gt;Rose (1924), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries AD, Virgil had gained a reputation as a [[virtuous pagan]], a term referring to [[paganism|pagans]] who were never [[evangelization|evangelized]] and consequently during their lifetime had no opportunity to recognize [[Christ]], but nevertheless led [[virtue|virtuous]] lives, so that it seemed objectionable to consider them [[damnation|damned]].&lt;ref&gt;Vitto (1989), pp. 36{{en dash}}49.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, some Christians sought to reconcile Virgil's works with the supposed Christianity present in them. Consequently, during the [[Late Antiquity]] and beyond, many assumed that the ''puer'' referenced in the Fourth ''Eclogue'' was actually [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Conte (1999), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early interpretations===

[[File:0 Constantinus I - Palazzo dei Conservatori (2).JPG|thumb|upright
|The Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]] was one of the first major figures to believe that ''Eclogue'' 4 was a pre-Christian augury concerning [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name=constantine/&gt;]]

According to Classicist Domenico Comparetti, in the [[early Christian]] era, "A certain theological doctrine, supported by various passages of [Judeo-Christian] scripture, induced men to look for prophets of Christ among the Gentiles".&lt;ref name=c101/&gt; This inevitably resulted in early Christians looking to the works of Virgil—a famed poet who, even in [[late antiquity]] had immense clout in Roman society—for any sign of prophecy.&lt;ref name=c101/&gt; Eventually, there arose a belief that Virgil’s Fourth ''Eclogue'' foretold the birth of Jesus, which seems to have first emerged during the 4th century.&lt;ref name=c100&gt;Comparetti (1895), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kallendorf51&gt;Kallendorf (2015), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar Steven Benko proposes that this interpretation became so popular around this time (and not earlier) because it "provided [Constantinian Christians] a way to connect to non-Christian society and to give Christianity respectability."&lt;ref name=Kallendorf52&gt;Kallendorf (2015), 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major proponent that the poem was prophetic was likely the early Christian writer [[Lactantius]], who served as [[Constantine the Great]]'s religious advisor.&lt;ref name=Kallendorf51/&gt; In a chapter of his book, ''[[Divinae Institutiones]]'' (''The Divine Institutes''), entitled "Of the Renewed World", Lactantius quotes the Eclogue and argues that it refers to [[Premillennialism|Jesus's awaited return at the end of the millennium]]. He further claims that "the poet [i.e. Virgil] foretold [the future coming Christ] according to the verses of the [[Cumaean Sibyl]]" (that is, the priestess presiding over the Apollonian [[oracle]] at [[Cumae]]).&lt;ref name=c101&gt;Comparetti (1895), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bourne392&gt;Bourne (1916), p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pelikan1999-37&gt;Pelikan (1999), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]], ''[[Divinae Institutiones]]'' 7.24.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sabine G. MacCormack]], this quote seems to suggest that while Lactantius believed the poem was a prophecy, he did not necessarily believe that Virgil himself was a prophet, as the poet was merely "reflect[ing] what the Sybil of Cumae and the Erythraean Sibyl had said long before [he] wrote."&lt;ref&gt;MacCormack (1998), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Sabine MacCormack, citing R. G. M. Nisbet, notes that Lactantius's belief "was not without objective merit", as it is possible that Virgil was appropriating aspects of Judeo-Christians prophecy by way of Eastern oracles.&lt;ref&gt;MacCormack (1998), p. 25, note 82.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}

Constantine himself also believed the poem could be interpreted as a prophecy about Christ. Many copies of the Roman historian [[Eusebius]]'s ''[[Life of Constantine|Vita Constantini]]'' (''The Life of Constantine'') also contain a transcript of a speech made by the emperor at a Good Friday sermon during the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (AD 325),&lt;ref name=bourne391/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kallendorf51/&gt;&lt;ref name=pelikan1999-36/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantine]] apud [[Eusebius]], ''Oratio ad coetum sanctorum'' 19{{en dash}}21.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the emperor re-imagines almost the entire poem line-by-line as a Christian portent (although a few are omitted because they overtly reference pagan characters and concepts). Some of Constantine’s interpretations are obvious: he argues that the ''virgo'' in line 6 is a reference to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Blessed Virgin Mary]], the ''puer'' in lines 8, 18, 60, and 62 to Christ, and the serpent in line 24 to the [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent of Evil]]. Others are more subjective: For instance, the lions in line 22 represent, to the emperor, those who [[Damnatio ad bestias#Execution of Christians|persecuted Christians]], and the Assyrian flower in line 25 represents the race of people, i.e. the Assyrians, who were "leader[s] in the faith of Christ".&lt;ref name=bourne391&gt;Bourne (1916), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=c100/&gt; The emperor also interpreted the reference to [[Achilles]] fighting against [[Troy]] in lines 34-36 as an [[allegory]] for Christ (the "new" Achilles) battling evil (the "new" Troy). Finally, Constantine proposed that lines 37-59 do not refer the birth of a normal, mortal child, but rather to a being who "mortal parents have not smiled upon": in other words, Jesus Christ, who, according to Christian scripture, "had no parents in the usual sense".&lt;ref name=constantine&gt;Bourne (1916), pp. 390{{en dash}}2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Constantine differed from Lactantius in his opinion of Virgil, arguing that, given all the supposed allusions in this poem, Virgil surely "wrote with full knowledge that he was foretelling Christ", but he "expressed himself darkly and introduced the mention of [Roman] deities to avoid affronting the pagans and provoking the anger of the authorities."&lt;ref name=c100/&gt;

Several decades later, [[Church Father]] [[Augustine of Hippo]] expressed his belief that Virgil was one of many "Gentile ... prophets" who by divine grace had prophesied Christ's birth.&lt;ref name=c101/&gt;&lt;ref name=pelikan1999-36&gt;Pelikan (1999), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine]], ''Epistolae ad Romanos inchoata expositio'' 1.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing the sentiment of Lactantius, he wrote that the mention of [[Cumae]] in line 4 was a likely reference to the supposed Sibylline prophecy concerning Christ. However, Augustine, reasoned that while Virgil may have prophesied the birth and coming of Christ, it was likely that he did not understand the true meaning of what he himself was writing.&lt;ref name=augustine&gt;Bourne (1916), p. 392–393.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine]], ''[[The City of God|De civitate Dei]]'', 10.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opinion that ''Eclogue'' 4 was a reference to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. [[St. Jerome]], an early Church Father now remembered best for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet because he never had the chance to accept Christ. Jerome further derided anyone who held Virgil as a pre-Christian prophet, calling such a belief childish and claiming that it was just as ridiculous as Christian ''[[Cento (poetry)|cento]]'' poems.&lt;ref name=c101/&gt;&lt;ref name=pelikan1999-36/&gt;&lt;ref name=bourne393/&gt; But regardless of his exact feelings, the classicist Ella Bourne notes that the mere fact Jerome responded to the belief is a testament to its pervasiveness and popularity during that time.&lt;ref name=bourne393&gt;Bourne (1916), p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval interpretations===

[[File:Dante Alighieri Statue SantaCroce.jpg|thumb|The famed Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]] likely believed that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet, and made the Roman a main character in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.]]

In the early part of the sixth century, Latin grammarian [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius]] made a passing reference to the supposed prophetic nature of the Fourth ''Eclogue'', noting: ''In quarta vaticinii artem adsumit'' ("In the Fourth [''Eclogue''], [Virgil] takes up the art of prophecy").&lt;ref name=bourne393/&gt; However, his view seems to have been a bit nuanced, and in one of his books, he wrote that "no one is permitted to know all the truth except ... Christians, on whom shines the sun of truth. But [Virgil did] not come as an expositor well-versed in [the] books of Scripture."&lt;ref name=Kallendorf54/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius]], ''Expositio Virgilianae continentiae secundum philosophos moralis'', 23{{en dash}}24.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Fulgentius's original Latin is written as if Virgil himself were saying it. The text in this article has been amended so that it is in [[Grammatical person|third]] rather than [[Grammatical person|first person]].|group="nb"}} Craig Kallendorf writes that this indicated Fulgentius's belief that "there [were] limits to what ... Virgil knew about Christianity."&lt;ref name=Kallendorf54&gt;Kallendorf (2015), 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, [[Donatus of Fiesole|Donatus]], a bishop of [[Fiesole]] in the ninth century, quoted the seventh line of the poem as part of a confession of his faith prior to his death.&lt;ref name=c102&gt;Comparetti (1895), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same century, [[Agnellus, Bishop of Ravenna|Agnellus]], the archbishop of [[Ravenna]], referenced the poem, noting that it was evidence that the [[Holy Spirit]] had spoken through both Virgil and the Sybil. The monk [[Christian Druthmar]] also makes use of the seventh line in his commentary on Matthew 20:30.&lt;ref name=Agnellus&gt;Bourne (1916), pp. 393{{en dash}}4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eleventh century, Virgil began appearing in plays, such as one particular Christmas work wherein the poet is the last "prophet" called on to give testimony concerning Christ. According to Bourne, the play was particularly popular, and philologist [[Du Cange]] gives mention of similar play performed at [[Rouen]]. Virgil and his purported prophecy even found itself in the [[Wakefield Mystery Plays]].&lt;ref name=plays&gt;Bourne (1916), pp. 394{{en dash}}5.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, ''Eclogue'' 4 and Virgil's supposed prophetic nature had saturated the Christian world; references to the poem are made by Abelard, the Bohemian historian Cosmos, and [[Pope Innocent III]] in a sermon. The ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'', a [[Latin]] collection of anecdotes and tales that was probably compiled about the end of the 13th century or the beginning of the 14th, confirms that the eclogue was pervasively associated with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne (1916), pp. 395{{en dash}}6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CumaeanSibylByMichelangelo.jpg|thumbnail|left|The [[Cumaean Sibyl]], as she appears on the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]].]]

Virgil eventually became a fixture of Medieval ecclesiastic art, appearing in churches, chapels, and even cathedrals, sometimes depicted holding a scroll with a select passage from the Fourth ''Eclogue'' on it.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne (1916), pp. 396{{en dash}}7.&lt;/ref&gt; At other times, he "figured in sacred pictures ... in the company of David, Isaiah and other [Judeo-Christian] prophets".&lt;ref name=c102/&gt; Virgil's popularity in Medieval art is likely why Michelangelo included the Cumaean Sibyl on the ceiling painting of the [[Sistine Chapel]], for, according to Paul Barolsky, the Sibyl's presence "evokes her song in Virgil [i.e. the Fourth ''Eclogue''], prophesying spiritual renewal through the coming of Christ{{em dash}}the very theme of the ceiling."&lt;ref name=barol/&gt; Barolsky also points out that Michelangelo painted the Sibyl in close proximity to the prophet Isaiah; thus, the painter drew a visual comparison between [[Eclogue 4#Meaning|the similar nature of their prophecies]].&lt;ref name=barol&gt;Barolsky (2007), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

This association between Virgil and Christianity reached a fever pitch in the fourteenth century, when the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' was published; the work, by [[Dante Alighieri]], prominently features Virgil as the main character's guide through Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne (1916), pp. 397{{en dash}}8.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, in the second book ''[[Purgatorio]]'', Dante and Virgil meet the poet [[Statius]], who, having "read a hidden meaning in lines of Virgil's own" (that is, ''Eclogue'' 4.5{{en dash}}7), was allowed passage into [[Purgatory]], and eventually [[Heaven]].&lt;ref name=bourne391/&gt;&lt;ref name=prooffordante&gt;Bourne (1916), p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kallendorf56&gt;Kallendorf (2015), 56.&lt;/ref&gt; (This legend had developed earlier in the Middle Ages, but Dante's reference popularized it).&lt;ref name=c102/&gt; Bourne argues that Dante's inclusion of Statius's conversion through Virgil's poem is proof enough that Dante, like those before him, believed Virgil to have been an unknowing Christian prophet.&lt;ref name=prooffordante/&gt; Kallendorf notes that because writing the lines did not save Virgil, but reading them saved Statius, "Dante ... must have located the Christinization of ''Eclogue'' 4 in the reader rather than the writer."&lt;ref name=Kallendorf56/&gt;

In the fifteenth century, a popular story concerning [[Secundian, Marcellian and Verian]]{{em dash}}who started out as persecutors of Christians during the reign of the Roman emperor [[Decius]]{{em dash}}emerged. The story claims that the trio were alarmed by the calm manner in which their Christian victims died, and so they turned to literature and chanced upon ''Eclogue'' 4, which eventually caused their conversions and martyrdom.&lt;ref name=prooffordante/&gt; Around this time, the famed [[astrology|astrologer]] and [[Christian humanism|humanist]] philsopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] seems to have accepted that the poem was a prophecy, too.&lt;ref name=c102/&gt;

===Later interpretations===
The French writer [[René Rapin]] (1621–1687) was fascinated with the potential connection between Virgil and Christianity, and used the Fourth ''Eclogue'' as an artistic influence, basing many of his lines in his own Sixth ''Eclogue'' on Virgil's work. One of the more overt modern references to the Fourth ''Eclogue'', Virgil, and Christianity, appears in [[Alexander Pope]]'s 1712 poem, ''[[Messiah (Latin poem)|Messiah]]''. Bourne wrote that the work "shows clearly that [Pope] believed that Virgil's poem was based on a Sibylline prophecy".&lt;ref name=p399&gt;Bourne (1916), p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Lowth]] seems also to have held this opinion, noting, by way of Plato, that the poem contains references made "not by men in their sober senses, but [by] the God himself".&lt;ref name=p399/&gt; In the mid-19th century, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] scholar [[John Keble]] claimed: ''Taceo si quid divinius ac sanctius (quod credo equidem) adhaeret istis auguriis'' ("I am silent about whether something more divine and sacred{{em dash}}which is what I, in fact, believe{{em dash}}clings to these prophecies").&lt;ref name=p400&gt;Bourne (1916), p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern views==

By the turn of the 20th century, most scholars had abandoned the idea that the Fourth ''Eclogue'' was prophetic, although "there [were] still some to be found who", in the words of Comparetti, "[took] this ancient farce seriously."&lt;ref&gt;Comparetti (1895), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars today by and large see the supposed Christian nature of the poem as a by-product of Virgil's creative references to disparate religious texts. This line of thought was notably advanced by [[Robin Nisbet]], who, after carefully analyzing the work, concluded that Virgil probably appropriated some elements used in the poem from Jewish mythology by means of Eastern oracles. In doing so, he adapted these ideas to Western (which is to say, Roman) modes of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet (1978), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious belief of the '''''Datuk Keramat''''' worship can be found in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and along the [[Strait of Malacca]]. It is a fusion of [[Malaysian folk religion]], [[Sufism]], and [[Chinese folk religion]].

In Malay, ''datuk'' means a village chief, a grandfather, or person in a high position and ''[[karamat|keramat]]'' is an [[Arabic]] loanword associated with Sufism that means "sacred, holy, blessed, mystical, supernatural, highly respected".

==Origins==
According to local legends, all datuks were once humans who had a standing in society either for their position or special attributes. They could have been an important leader, a renowned healer, a [[silat]] warrior, a pious man or even a [[shaman]]. Upon their death, locals and their followers would sometimes offer prayers at their gravestones, in line with the concept of ''keramat''. With the arrival of Chinese immigrants who carried along with them the Confucian belief of ancestor worship, both practices converged and formed a new micro-culture as observed today. Datuks, referred to in Chinese as [[Na Tuk Kong]], is considered a localised form in worship of the spirit of the land, along with Tu Di Gong (earth spirits).

==Shrines==

{{See also|Mazar (mausoleum)}}

Around the Malaysian countryside some small, yellow-coloured painted shrines called ''keramat'' can be found by the roadside or under a tree. These shrines are usually worshipped by the residents living around the neighbourhood. The shrines are normally of a fusion Chinese-Malay design, with [[Islamic]] elements such as the crescent moon decorations. Inside the simple room, a small, decorated statue is venerated, depicting the datuk. Around the statue offerings are brought, sometimes on a small altar in front of the datuk statue.

==Types==
One belief is that there are a total of nine types of datuks, and that each of them were once great warriors and expert in Malay local martial arts, the ''Silat'' except for the last datuk. They were also known to possess great magical powers. Worshippers usually pray to datuks for protection, good health, and good luck, and sometimes seek divine help to overcome their problems.

Below are the nine datuks named according to their seniority from the eldest to the youngest:

1. ''Datuk Panglima Ali'' (Ali)&lt;br&gt;
2. ''Datuk Panglima Hitam'' (Black)&lt;br&gt;
3. ''Datuk Panglima Harimau'' (Tiger)&lt;br&gt;
4. ''Datuk Panglima Hijau'' (Green)&lt;br&gt;
5. ''Datuk Panglima Kuning'' (Yellow)&lt;br&gt;
6. ''Datuk Panglima Putih'' (White)&lt;br&gt;
7. ''Datuk Panglima Bisu'' (Mute)&lt;br&gt;
8. ''Datuk Panglima Merah'' (Red)&lt;br&gt;
9. ''Datuk Panglima Bongsu'' (Youngest)

The structure of datuk worship is diversified according to localities. For example, in the old quarters of Georgetown, the presence of The Seven Brothers or ''Tujuh Beradik ''is common while in the royal town of Klang in Selangor, most of the spirits worshipped are believed to be members of the royal court (Sultans, officers, warriors etc.), each with their own unique identity.

==Worship ritual==
Worshippers usually offer fresh flowers, ''sireh'' (betelnuts), ''rokok daun'' (local hand rolled cigarettes), sliced ''pinang'' (areca nuts) and local fruits. An important part of the praying ritual is also to burn some ''kemenyan'' (benzoin - made of a local gum tree, when burnt will emit a smoky fragrant smell).

If their prayers are answered, the worshippers usually return to the shrine and make offerings or hold a ''[[kenduri]]'' (feast). Another common practise is for individuals to renovate the shrines to create a better looking shrine for the Datuk. In most places where there is a heavy presence of datuk spirits, it is common to see shrines becoming larger over time, especially if individuals consider the datuk to be 'powerful'.

The kenduri items usually consist of yellow saffron rice, lamb or chicken curries, vegetables, ''pisang rastali'' (bananas), young coconuts, rose syrup, ''cherrot''s (local cigars) and local fruits.

Pork items are considered impure and are therefore totally forbidden in a shrine; visitors are also asked to not show disrespect when inside or around a shrine.

'''Druhyu'''s ({{lang-sa|द्रुह्यु}}) were a tribe of [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Vedic Aryan]]s in Ancient [[India]]. They are mentioned in the Rigveda,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. RV 1.108.8; 7.18; 8.10.5; 6.46.8&lt;/ref&gt; often together with the [[Anu (tribe)|Anu]] tribe. Some early scholars have placed them in the northwestern region.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonell-Keith, Vedic Index 1912, vol.  I p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] and [[Puranas]] locate Druhyus in the North western part of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Puranic lore contain accounts of a large scale migration of Drhyus from [[Punjab]] into central Asia. Druhyu king Angara is said to have been driven out of Punjab by King [[Mandhatri]] of the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pillai|first=S.

E. Pargiter]] theorises that the next Druhyu king Gandhara named the north-western state [[Gandhāra]] after himself. Puranas do not refer to Druhyus after the King Pracetas whose 100 sons settled in the region north of [[Afghanistan]] (udīcya) and became ''[[Mleccha]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bryant|first=Edwin|title=The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture:The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nkJAmVuBCcIC&amp;pg=PA138|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513777-4|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Bhagavata 9.23.15–16; Visnu 4.17.5; Vayu 99.11–12; Brahmanda 3.74.11–12 and Matsya 48.9.). [[Vishnu Purana]] also lists [[Aratta]] and Setu as areas where Druhyus settled.(Vishnu Purana IV.17)

[[Image:Jakob Jordaens 002.jpg|thumb|right|The Four Evangelists]]

In Christianity, '''Evangelism''' is the commitment to or act of publicly preaching of the [[Gospel]] with the intention of spreading the message and teachings of [[Jesus Christ]].

Christians who specialize in evangelism are often known as '''evangelists''', whether they are in their home communities or living as [[missionaries]] in the field, although some Christian traditions refer to such people as ''missionaries'' in either case. Some Christian traditions consider evangelists to be in a leadership position; they may be found preaching to large meetings or in governance roles.

Christian groups who encourage evangelism are sometimes known as evangelistic or ''evangelist''. The scriptures do not use the word ''evangelism'', but ''evangelist'' is used in (the translations of) {{bibleref2|Acts|21:8}}, {{bibleref2|Ephesians|4:11}}, and {{bibleref2|2 Timothy|4:5}}.

==Etymology==
{{main|The gospel}}
The word ''evangelist'' comes from the [[Koine Greek]] word {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:εὐαγγέλιον|εὐαγγέλιον]]}} (transliterated as ''euangelion'') via Latinised ''evangelium'' as used in the canonical titles of the [[Four Gospels]], authored by (or attributed to) [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], and [[John the Evangelist|John]] (also known as the [[Four Evangelists]]). The Greek word {{lang|grc|εὐαγγέλιον}} originally meant a reward given to the messenger for good news ({{lang|grc|εὔ}} = "good", {{lang|grc|ἀγγέλλω}} = "I bring a message"; the word "[[angel]]" comes from the same root) and later "good news" itself.

The verb form of ''euangelion'',&lt;ref&gt;The 7 Principles of an Evangelistic Life, p. 32, Douglas M. Cecil, Moody Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; (translated as "evangelism"), occurs rarely in older Greek literature outside the [[New Testament]], making its meaning more difficult to ascertain.  Parallel texts of the Gospels of Luke and Mark reveal a synonymous relationship between the verb ''euangelizo'' ({{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:εὑαγγελίζω|εὑαγγελίζω]]}}) and a Greek verb ''kerusso'' ({{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:κηρύσσω|κηρύσσω]]}}), which means "to proclaim".&lt;ref&gt;

==Proselytism==
{{Main|Proselytism}}
Some Christians distinguish between evangelism and proselytism, the latter viewed as unethical because it is taken to involve the abuse of people’s freedom and the distortion of the gospel of grace by means of coercion, deception, manipulation, and exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;A. Scott Moreau, Harold Netland, and Charles van Engen, Evangelical Dictionary of World Missions, Baker Reference Library (Grand Rapids, MI; Carlisle, Cumbria, UK: Baker Books; A. Scott Moreau, 2000), p.213, 794 .&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ‘proselytize’ might be used when one group does not approve of the missional activities of another, particularly when one group is losing members to another group.&lt;ref&gt;Evangelical Review of Theology, Proselytism or Evangelism?, Cecil Stalnaker, Vol. 26, January 2002, Published by Paternoster Periodicals for World Evangelical Alliance Theological Commission, {{ISSN|0144-8153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different denominations follow different [[Theology|theological]] interpretations which reflect upon the point of who is doing the actual conversion, whether the evangelist or the Holy Spirit or both. [[Calvinists]], for example, believe the soul is converted only if the Holy Spirit is effective in the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Catholicism|Catholic]] missionary work in [[Russia]] is commonly seen as evangelism, not proselytism. Archbishop [[Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz (archbishop)|Kondrusiewicz]] openly stated, "that proselytism is absolutely unacceptable and cannot constitute a strategy for the development of our structures either in Russia or in any other country in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]'s [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] issued a document called "Doctrinal Note on some Aspects of Evangelization"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-ew.org.uk/PDF%27s/evangelisation_note_english_141207.pdf |title=Doctrinal Note on some Aspects of Evangelization| publisher=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|date=3 December 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071220172248/http://www.catholic-ew.org.uk/PDF%27s/evangelisation_note_english_141207.pdf |archivedate = 20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that evangelism is "an inalienable right and duty, an expression of religious liberty ...", and added, "The incorporation of new members into the Church is not the expansion of a power group, but rather entrance into the network of friendship with Christ which connects heaven and earth, different continents and age. It is entrance into the gift of communion with Christ...."

In recent history, certain [[Bible]] passages have been used to promote evangelism. [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]], in a book entitled, 'An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens' popularised a quotation, where, according to the Bible, during his last days on earth [[Jesus]] commanded his eleven disciples (the apostles) as follows:

{{Quotation| Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. |[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28:19,20 [[NIV]]}}

However, recent scholarship by Chris Wright and others has suggested that such activity is promoted by the entire Bible, or at least the wider term 'mission', although the meaning of the word 'mission' and its relationship to 'evangelism' is disputed amongst Christians.

==Modern methods==
[[File:Ashes to Go in Connecticut.jpg|thumb|right|250px|On [[Ash Wednesday]], the first day of the Christian penitential season of [[Lent]], an [[Anglican]] priest has a Ashes to Go station for commuters at the [[Metro-North Railroad]] in the American state of Connecticut.]]
{{see also|Approaches to evangelism}}
Breaking from tradition and going beyond television and radio a wide range of methods have been developed to reach people not inclined to attend traditional events in churches or revival meetings.

Dramas such as ''[[Heaven's Gates, Hell's Flames]]'' have gained enormous popularity since the 1980s. These dramas typically depict fictional characters who die and learn whether they will go to heaven or hell.

The [[child evangelism movement]] is a Christian evangelism movement that originated in the 20th century. It focuses on the 4/14 Window which centers on evangelizing children between the ages of 4 and 14 years old.&lt;ref name="4-14core"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4to14window.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4-14-Window-Golden-Age-of-Opportunity-Brochure.pdf |title=4/14 Window - a Golden Age of Opportunity |author=Luis Bush |publisher=4/14 Movement |date=June 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014194751/http://www.4to14window.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4-14-Window-Golden-Age-of-Opportunity-Brochure.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, a group of Christian athletes known as [[The Power Team]] spawned an entire genre of Christian entertainment based on strong-man exploits mixed with a Christian message and usually accompanied by an opportunity to respond with a prayer for salvation.&lt;ref&gt;http://journalstar.com/lifestyles/faith-and-values/coming-on-strong-power-team-lifts-weights-and-spirits/article_dbe77b67-99ce-59f4-b994-d0c0e5891228.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other entertainment-based Christian evangelism events include comedy, live theater and music.

The [[Christian music industry]] has also played a significant role in modern evangelism. [[Rock music|Rock]] (and other genres) concerts in which the artist(s) exhort non-believing attendees to pray a prayer for salvation have become common, and just as common are concerts that are focused on activity not necessarily on prayer and conversion, thus forming an environment that is not driven by conversion, but instead relaying of a message.

Evangelists such as [[Reinhard Bonnke]]  conduct mass evangelistic crusades around the world. Hundreds of church denominations and organizations participate in an evangelism movement known as the [[Billion Soul Harvest]], which is a comprehensive initiative to convert a billion people to Christianity.

New opportunities for evangelization have been provided in recent decades by increased travel opportunities and by instant communications over the internet.&lt;ref name=Dulles&gt;[[Avery Dulles|Dulles SJ, Avery]]. Evangelization for the Third Millennium (Kindle Locations 781-782). Paulist Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evangelists==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 194-0798-41, Düsseldorf, Veranstaltung mit Billy Graham.jpg|thumb|Billy Graham in [[Düsseldorf]] (1954)]]
Some churches use the title ''evangelist'' of a minister who travels from town to town and from church to church, spreading [[the gospel]] of Jesus Christ. In this sense the person is differentiated from a local [[pastor]], with a ministry grounded in a specific community.

Some denominations have a formally recognised office of evangelist as part of their ministry, such as the [[Evangelist (Anglican Church)|commissioned evangelists]] of the [[Church of England]] and some other Anglican churches.

Many Christians of various [[Theology|theological]] perspectives would call themselves evangelists because they are spreaders of the gospel. Many churches believe one of their major functions is to function as evangelists to spread the evangelist belief that Jesus is savior of humanity.

The title of evangelist is often associated with those who lead large meetings like those of [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]], [[Luis Palau]] and [[Jorge Armando Pérez|J.A. Pérez]], possibly in tents or existing [[church (building)|church buildings]], or those who address the public in [[open air preaching|street corner preaching]], which targets listeners who happen to pass nearby. It can also be done in small groups or even on a one-to-one basis, but actually it is simply one who spreads the gospel. Increasingly, the internet enables anyone to become an [[Internet evangelist]].

==Missionary work==
{{Further|Christian mission}}
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
The New Testament urges believers to speak [[the gospel]] clearly, fearlessly, graciously, and respectfully whenever an opportunity presents itself, incumbent upon a commitment to hold and revere God as the core/center of their lives (see {{bibleref2|Colossians|4:2-6}}, {{bibleref2|Ephesians|6:19-20}}, and {{bibleref2|1 Peter|3:15}}).

Throughout most of its history, Christianity has been spread evangelistically, though the extent of evangelism has varied significantly between Christian communities, and denominations.  Evangelism, [[apologetics]] and apostolic ministry often go hand in hand. An [[wiktionary:ἀπόστολος|ἀπόστολος]] (''apostolos'') is literally "one who is ordered forth" and refers to the [[missionary]] calling of being ordered forth into the world by the initiation of God.  An example of an interplay between Evangelism and Apologetics can be seen in the USA when upon door to door Evangelism the prospect is an unbeliever and challenges the Evangelist wherein the Evangelist then follows into the role of the Apologist in defense of their faith with the hope that Evangelism may be restarted.  Since missionaries often travel to areas or people groups where Jesus is not yet known, they frequently take on an evangelistic role. But the apostolic or missionary calling is not necessarily the same (and it is a misnomer and misinterpretation to equate them), as there are many who serve in missionary, church planting, and ministry development roles who have an apostolic calling or serve in an apostolic role but whose primary duty is not evangelism.

== Catholic Evangelism ==

=== Evangelism in Vatican II Documents ===

In the very first sentence of its Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen gentium]], the [[Second Ecumenical Council|Vatican II Council]] affirmed that Christ had sent the Church to preach the gospel to every creature (LG 1; cf. Mk 16:15).  Evangelism is a theme in multiple Vatican II documents.  These documents mentioned “gospel” 157 times, “evangelize” 18 times, and “evangelization” 31 times.&lt;ref name=DullesChurchSociety&gt; {{cite book |last1=Dulles, SJ |first1=Avery |title=Church and Society, The McGinley Lectures, 1988–2007|date=2008 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=978-0-8232-2862-1 |pages=546 |edition=Kindle |url=https://www.amazon.com/Church-Society-Laurence-McGinley-1988-2007/dp/0823228622 |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4683">In Iran, the '''Gozinesh''' Law (passed in 1985) has the effect of prohibiting a number of religious and ethnic minorities from fully participating in civil life. This law and other ''gozinesh'' provisions make access to employment, education, and a range of other areas conditional upon a rigorous ideological screening, the principal prerequisite for which is devotion to the tenets of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/06/005324.php Ideological Screening]&lt;/ref&gt; 

These laws are regularly applied to discriminate against religious and ethnic groups that are not officially recognized, such as the [[Mandaeans]], [[Ahl-e Haq]], and [[Baha'i]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&amp;yr=2005&amp;c=IRN Annual Report for Iran], 2005, [[Amnesty International]].&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations has repeatedly expressed concern over this practice in the reports of [[UN Secretary-General]], in the reports of [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], and so on. Some recent examples of such concerns are given below:

&lt;blockquote&gt;28. The [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], after considering the combined eighteenth and nineteenth periodic reports of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] in August 2010, expressed concern at the limited enjoyment of political, economic, social and cultural rights by, ''[[inter alia]]'', [[Arab]], [[Azeri]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]] and [[Kurd]]ish communities and some communities of non-citizens, in particular with regard to housing, education, freedom of expression and religion, health and employment, despite the economic growth in the country. 

The Committee drew particular attention to reports regarding the application of the “gozinesh” criterion, a selection procedure requiring prospective State officials and employees to demonstrate allegiance to the Islamic Republic of Iran and the State religion, and expressed concern that it might limit employment opportunities and political participation for members of [[Arab]], [[Azeri]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Jew]]ish, [[Armenian people|Armenian]] and [[Kurd]]ish communities (see CERD/C/IRN/CO/18-19).&lt;ref name="UN_66"&gt;Sixty-sixth session of the UN General Assembly, Item 69 (c) of the provisional agenda: Promotion and protection of human rights: human rights situations and reports of special rapporteurs and representatives. The situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Report of the Secretary-General. Ref.: [https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/66/361 A/66/361].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the current position of the Iran's Government concerning the law of ''gozinesh'', [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] notes the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Discrimination on the basis of religion and ethnicity'''

The Committee notes that this Committee and the Conference Committee have on a number of occasions highlighted the seriousness of the situation of unrecognized [[religious minorities]], in particular the [[Baha’i]], and the urgency of taking decisive action to combat discrimination against them. &lt;...&gt; The Committee also notes that [[Education International|EI]] has expressed concern regarding the religious-based discrimination against the [[Baha’i]] in terms of access to education, universities, and to particular occupations in the public sector.

With respect to the practice of ''gozinesh'', a selection procedure requiring prospective state officials and employees to demonstrate allegiance to the state religion, the Government states that two positions have been put forward regarding the Selection Law based on Religious and Ethical Standards, 1995: one group proposed that it be abolished, with selection decisions being solely based on qualifications; the second group proposed the amendment of some of the provisions of the Law. Both proposals were rejected, the first by a majority of members of Parliament, and the second by the [[Guardian Council]]. 

The Government states that the Law recognizes not only [[Islam]] but also the religions officially recognized in the Constitution. The Committee notes, however, that unrecognized religious minorities remain subject to the practice of ''gozinesh''.&lt;ref name="ILC.100/III/1A"&gt;International Labour Conference, 100th Session, 2011. Report of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. [http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/reports/reports-submitted/WCMS_151556/lang--en/index.htm ILC.100/III/1A].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pp-semi-indef}} '''Gurbachan Singh''' (10 December 1930 – 24 April 1980) was the third [[guru]] of the [[Sant Nirankari Mission|Sant Nirankari]] sect,&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web |title=SNM History – Baba Gurbachan Singh Ji |url=http://www.nirankari.com/history/hist4.htm |work=Sant Nirankari Mission|publisher=Sant Nirankari Mandal (Regd.) |accessdate=11 December 2010|location=Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered to be [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] by mainstream [[Sikhs]].&lt;ref name="Pritpal Singh Bindra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bindra.net/s-022.html |title=Nirankaris and Sant (Neo-)Nirankaris |author=Pritpal Singh Bindra |date=30 August 2009 |work=Essays on Sikhism |accessdate=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was declared [[Satguru]] by his father and predecessor [[Baba Avtar Singh]] in 1962.

== Early life ==

Gurbachan Singh was born to Avtar Singh and his wife Budhwanti. He completed his [[middle school]] education in Peshawar, and then matriculated from the Khalsa School in [[Rawalpindi]]. He had to abandon his higher studies due to the violence during the [[partition of India]] in 1947. He married Kulwant Kaur, the daughter of Bhai Manna Singh, 22 April 1947.

In 1947, the Singh family migrated from the present-day Pakistan to present-day India. Gurbachan Singh established an auto parts business, first in [[Jalandhar]] and then in [[Delhi]]. Later, he started taking interest in the congregations of his father.

Gurbachan Singh was declared as the ''Satguru'' ("True Master") by his father on 3 December 1962 at [[Paharganj]] in Delhi. At the two conferences of the mission in [[Mussoorie]] (1965 and 1973), he made important changes to the organisation and established a code of conduct.

== Clashes with orthodox Sikhs ==

In 1978, the Nirankari mission&lt;ref name="Articles, Poems and Plays"&gt;{{cite web |title=Articles, Poems and Plays – Montreal Branch |url=http://www.nirankari.com/montreal/articles.html |work=Sant Nirankari Mission|publisher=Sant Nirankari Mandal (Regd.) |accessdate=14 December 2010|location=Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Delhi]] and other parts of the [[Indian sub-continent]] gathered a congregation at [[Amritsar]]. A few orthodox Sikhs of [[Akhand Kirtani Jatha]] and [[Damdami Taksal]] marched from the [[Harmandir Sahib|Darbar Sahib]] to protest the Nirankari congregation, whom they considered [[heterodox]]. In the [[1978 Sikh-Nirankari clash|resulting violence]], 15 individuals including thirteen Khalsa Sikhs and two Sant Nirankaris were killed.&lt;ref name="Brian2001"&gt;{{cite book | author=Brian Keith Axel | title=The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation of a Sikh "Diaspora" | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gj8yJsixw8QC&amp;pg=PA123 | accessdate=14 March 2013 | year=2001 | publisher=Duke University Press | isbn=978-0-8223-2615-1 | page=123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jatha]] leader [[Bhai Fauja Singh]] was one among the killed.

Sixty-four followers of the Nirankari mission were arrested for the killings.&lt;ref name=SATP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/nightsoffalsehood/falsehood4.htm |title=Punjab: The Knights of Falsehood – Psalms of Terror |date=31 December 2001 |work=[http://www.satp.org/ South Asia Terrorism Portal] |publisher=Institute for Conflict Management |location=New Delhi |accessdate=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April 1978 the detained members of the Nirankari sect were released, after formal charges against them were rejected by the session-Judge of [[Karnal]], who stated in his judgement "The case of the prosecution was intrinsically wrong. It was all frame-up and after thought." 

On 25 September 1978, Gurbachan Singh arrived in [[Kanpur]].  A group of protesters arrived at the [[Nirankari Bhawan]] to protest against his presence.&lt;ref name="All About Sikhs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/historical-events/sikh-history-kanpur-massacre-1978.html |title=Sikh History:Kanpur Massacre 1978 |publisher=Gateway to Sikhism |accessdate=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September 1978, anticipating fresh trouble, the [[Government of Punjab, India|Punjab Government]] barred Nirankari Chief Gurbachan Singh from entering [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] for six months. The [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] later rescinded the ban.

On 6 October 1978, a [[Hukamnama|Hukumnama]] by the [[Jathedar]] of [[Akal Takht]] was issued, calling upon Sikhs to socially boycott the Nirankaris.

== Death ==

In 1980, Ranjit Singh, a member of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, managed to obtain employment at the Nirankari headquarters in [[Delhi]] as a carpenter. On the evening of 24 April 1980, he waited with an automatic rifle in a room of the guest house. Ranjit Singh shot Gurbachan Singh through a window when he returned from a public function at about 11pm. Ranjit Singh managed to escape. The [[First Information Report]] named twenty people for the murder, including several known associates of [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]], who was also charged with conspiracy to murder.&lt;ref name="Sikh Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sikhtimes.com/bios_060604a.html |title=Biographies – Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale: Five Myths |author=Puneet Singh Lamba |date=6 June 2004 |publisher=The Sikh Times |location=Toronto, Ontario |archiveurl=http://www.sikhtimes.com/bios_060604a.html |oclc=284842558 |archivedate=5 July 2010 |accessdate=13 December 2010 |quote=After the assassination of the Nirankari leader Gurbachan Singh on April 24, 1980, Bhindranwale is universally acknowledged to have remarked that if he ever met Bhaii Ranjit Singh, the suspected killer, he would weigh him in gold (i.e. reward him with his weight in gold). }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranjit Singh surrendered in 1983, and was in jail for 13 years.

According to a ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' report, Ranjit Singh said about the murder: "I have no regrets. I did it for the [[Panth]] (Nation)."&lt;ref name="Hindustan Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sikh politics at a key turn |first=Vishal |last=Thapar |url=http://www.media-watch.org/articles/0299/307.html |newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]] |publisher=HT Media Ltd |location=New Delhi |oclc=232114063 |date=14 February 1999 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=13 December 2010 |quote=Fundamentalism comes easy to Bhai Ranjit Singh |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311010926/http://www.media-watch.org/articles/0299/307.html |archivedate=11 March 2007 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the [[Delhi High Court]] upheld his conviction and cancelled the bail.

In the primary scripture of [[Islam]], the [[Quran]], '''Haman''' was the [[grand vizier]] and [[high priest]] of the [[pharaoh]], and associated with him in his court at the time of prophet, [[Moses in Islam|Moses]]. The name Haman appears six times throughout the [[Qur'an]],&lt;ref&gt;''A-Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', Wheeler, ''Haman''&lt;/ref&gt; four times with Pharaoh and twice by himself,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchtruth.com/search.php?keyword=haman&amp;chapter=&amp;translator=5&amp;search=1&amp;start=0&amp;search_word=all], Qur'an 28:6, 28:8, 28:38, 29:39, 40:24, 40:36.&lt;/ref&gt; where God ([[Allah]]) sent Moses to invite Pharaoh, Haman, and their people to [[monotheism]], and to seek protection of the Israelites Haman and Pharaoh were tormenting. Referring to Moses as a sorcerer and a liar the Pharaoh rejected Moses' call to worship the God of Moses and refused to set the children of Israel free. The Pharaoh commissioned Haman to build a tall tower using burnt bricks so that the Pharaoh could climb far up and see the God of Moses. The Pharaoh, Haman, and their army in chariots pursuing the fleeing children of Israel drowned in the [[Red Sea]] as the parted water closed up on them. The Pharaoh's submission to God at the moment of death and total destruction was rejected but his dead body was saved as a lesson for posterity and he was mummified. The dead bodies of Haman and some soldiers have been also mummified.

'''Idacansás''', '''Idacansas''', '''Idacanzas''' or '''Iduakanzas'''&lt;ref&gt;Correa, 2005, p.204&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Muisca mythology|mythical]] ''[[cacique]]'' who was said to have been the first priest of the sacred city of [[Sogamoso|Sugamuxi]], present-day Sogamoso, [[Colombia]], then part of the territories of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]]. He is characterized by his great magical powers as he could make rain and hail and transmit diseases and warmth.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.12, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In the centuries before the arrival of the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s, the central highlands of Colombia consisted of the [[Muisca Confederation]], ruled by ''[[zaque]]s'' from [[Tunja|Hunza]] and ''[[zipa]]s'' from [[Bogotá|Bacatá]]. Other areas, such as the territories surrounding [[Sogamoso]] were ruled by ''caciques''; respected religious nobility. Before the time of the first confirmed human rulers [[Hunzahúa]], who is considered an heir of Idacansás, and [[Meicuchuca]], inaugurated in 1450, the chronicles are based on [[Muisca religion and mythology|mythology]].

== Mythography ==
''Cacique'' Idacansás was together with [[Bochica]] the priest of the [[Sun]], with his [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Sun Temple]] located in Sugamuxi. Allegedly the only ''cacicazgo'' (reign of a ''cacique'') where a system of [[democracy]] existed was the ''cacicazgo'' of Sugamuxi in the [[Iraka Valley]]. 17th century Spanish chronicler [[Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita]] wrote that the ''cacique'' of Sugamuxi was chosen by the natives of [[Firavitoba]] and [[Floresta, Boyacá|Tobasía]], an election organized by the ''caciques'' of [[Gámeza]], [[Busbanzá]], [[Pesca]] and [[Toca, Boyacá|Toca]]. In case of conflicts, the ''cacique'' of [[Duitama|Tundama]] (present-day Duitama) would intervene.&lt;ref name=p77&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.12, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''cacique'' of Sugamuxi always had a double role as political and religious leader, as High Priest of the Sun. Under his rule was the Sun Temple where Muisca [[pilgrim]]s from far away gathered. The reign of Idacansás made Sugamuxi a religious centre; the [[Rome]] or [[Mecca]] of the Muisca. The [[myth]] of Idacansás explains the origin of the ''cacicazgo'' and the sacred character around the Sun as unique on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] that was ruled by often brutal ([[Nemequene]]) dictatorial rulers.&lt;ref name=p77/&gt;

To maintain the support of the people, Idacansás used lies and deceit; he pretended he was angry with the people and threatened them with death, diseases or other methods. In other occasions he would climb a mountain dressed in coloured mantles and accompanied by some of his nobles and to let the people know there was an [[epidemic]] of [[disentery]] coming, he would sprinkle orange or ochre-red dust in the air. Sometimes he would dress in white and throw ash in the air announcing that ice and aridity would come over the fertile lands of the Muisca, destroying their crops. To enhance the character of his foretellings he would react irritated to the people who came to see him as priest.

The rule of Idacansás was so widely respected and feared because he was able to change the chronological order of things happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} Restrepo, Vicente, 1837-1899 [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/chibch/chibch17a.htm Los Chibchas antes de la conquista española - Ch.

Some Muisca [[chronicler]]s equate Idacansás with [[Bochica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/bochica.html Bochica as Idacansás] - Pueblos Originarios - accessed 23-04-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "invincible ignorance" has its roots in [[Catholic theology]], where — as the opposite of the term [[vincible ignorance]] — it is used to refer to the state of persons (such as pagans and infants) who are ignorant of the [[Christianity|Christian]] message because they have not yet had an opportunity to hear it. The first Pope to use the term officially seems to have been [[Pope Pius IX]] in the [[allocution]] ''Singulari Quadam'' (9 December 1854) and the [[encyclical]]s ''Singulari Quidem'' (17 March 1856) and ''Quanto Conficiamur Moerore'' (10 August 1863). The term, however, is far older than that. [[Aquinas]], for instance, uses it in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (written 1265–1274),&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2076.htm#article2 ''Summa Theologica'' Ia IIae q.76 a.2]&lt;/ref&gt; and discussion of the concept can be found as far back as [[Origen]] (3rd century). {{Citation needed|reason=Where did Origen say this?|date=August 2018}}

When and how the term was taken by logicians to refer to the very different state of persons who pigheadedly refuse to attend to evidence (see [[Invincible ignorance fallacy]]) remains unclear, but one of its first uses was in the 1959 book ''Fallacy: The Counterfeit of Argument '' by W. Ward Fearnside and William B. Holther.&lt;ref&gt;Fearnside, W. Ward and William B. Holther, ''Fallacy: The Counterfeit of Argument'', 1959. {{ISBN|9780133017700}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 96.9%  of the population of [[Azerbaijan]] is nominally Muslim. (Estimates include 96.9% Muslim (Shia),&lt;ref name=CIAFB&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|quote=91.6%|website=CIA|accessdate=23 May 2015|date=May 18, 2015|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 93.4% (Berkley Center, 2012),&lt;ref name=BCRPWA&gt;{{cite web|title=Berkley Center for Religion Peace and World Affairs|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/azerbaijan|publisher=Georgetown University|accessdate=23 May 2015|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 99.2% (Pew Research Center, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/Muslimpopulation.pdf MAPPING THE GLOBAL MUSLIM POPULATION]| PEW FORUM| October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;) The rest of the population adheres to other faiths or are non-religious, although they are not officially represented. Among the Muslim majority, religious observance varies and Muslim identity tends to be based more on culture and ethnicity rather than religion. The Muslim population is approximately 85% [[Shi'a]] and 15% [[Sunni]]; differences traditionally have not been defined sharply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf Administrative Department of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan - Presidential Library - Religion]&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic of Azerbaijan has the second highest Shia population percentage in the world after [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan Eduardo Campo,''Encyclopedia of Islam'', p.625&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Shias are adherents of orthodox [[Twelver|Ithna Ashari]] school of Shi'a Islam. Other traditional [[religion]]s or  beliefs that are followed by many in the country are the orthodox [[Hanafi]] school of Sunni Islam. Traditionally villages around Baku and [[Lenkoran]] region are considered stronghold of Shi'ism. In some northern regions, populated by Sunni Dagestani ([[Lezghian]]) people, the [[Salafi]] movement gained some following. [[Folk Islam]] is widely practiced.

According to a 2010 [[Gallup Poll]] found 49% of Azerbaijanis answering no to the question "Is religion an important part of your daily life?", one of the highest rates among any Muslim-majority country.&lt;ref name=gallup&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations]  August 31, 2010 - data accessed on 22 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1998 poll estimated the proportion of ardent believers in Azerbaijan at only 7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Fereydoun Safizadeh, "On Dilemmas of Identity in the Post-Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan," ''Caucasian Regional Studies'', vol.3, no.1 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"&gt;[[Tadeusz Swietochowski]] [http://www.islamawareness.net/Asia/Azerbaijan/aj_article002.html Azerbaijan: The Hidden Faces of Islam. ''World Policy Journal'', Volume XIX, No 3, Fall 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Islam arrived in Azerbaijan with Arabs in the seventh century, gradually supplanting [[Christianity in Azerbaijan|Christianity]] and [[paganism|pagan]] cults.

In the sixteenth century, the first shah of the [[Safavid]] Dynasty, [[Ismail I]] (r. 1486-1524), established Shi'a Islam as the state religion, although a portion of people remained Sunni. The population of what is nowadays [[Iran]] and what is nowadays Azerbaijan were converted to Shia Islam at the same moment in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8IKR0oqdRkC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=safavid+persia+conversion&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=201#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=The Caspian: politics, energy and security, By Shirin Akiner, pg.158|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As elsewhere in the Muslim world, the two branches of Islam came into conflict in Azerbaijan. [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|Enforcement of Shi'a Islam]] as the state religion brought contention between the Safavid rulers and the ruling Sunnis of the neighboring [[Ottoman Empire]].

In the nineteenth century, many Sunni Muslims emigrated from Russian-controlled Azerbaijan because of Russia's series of wars with their coreligionists in the Ottoman Empire.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Thus, by the late nineteenth century, the Shi'a population was in the majority in Russian Azerbaijan. Antagonism between the Sunnis and the Shi'a diminished in the late nineteenth century as Azerbaijani nationalism began to emphasize a common Turkic heritage and opposition to [[Iran]]ian religious influences.

===Russian Empire and Soviet Union===
{{islam by country}}
In 1806, what is now Azerbaijan became occupied by the [[Russian Empire]] as the latter invaded [[Qajar Iran]] during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]]. In the aftermath, [[Qajar dynasty|Iran]] was forced to cede therefore almost all of what is nowadays Azerbaijan according to the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] of 1813 to Russia. However, all this only came to be confirmed in the aftermath of the next and last war between Russia and Iran, the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]] and the resulting [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] of 1828. In 1918, what is now Azerbaijan declared independence from Russia and established the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] under its leading [[Musavat]] party, but was incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]] in 1920.

Before Soviet power was established, about 2,000 [[mosque]]s were active in Azerbaijan. Most mosques were closed in the 1930s, then some were allowed to reopen during [[World War II]]. The Soviet rule promoted an Azerbaijani national consciousness as a substitute for identification with the world Islamic community.

During World War II, Soviet authorities established the [[Muslim Spiritual Board of Transcaucasia]] in Baku as the governing body of Islam in the [[Caucasus]], in effect reviving the nineteenth-century [[tsarist]] [[Muslim Ecclesiastical Board]]. During the tenures of [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Moscow]] encouraged Muslim religious leaders in Azerbaijan to visit and host foreign Muslim leaders, with the goal of advertising the freedom of religion and superior living conditions reportedly enjoyed by Muslims under Soviet communism.

During the [[Azerbaijani SSR]], there were 17 mosques functioning in the country. In the 1980s only two large and five smaller mosques held services in Baku, and only eleven others were operating in the rest of the country. Supplementing the officially sanctioned mosques were thousands of private houses of prayer and many secret Islamic sects.

The lone center of conservative Shia Islam, was the town of [[Nardaran]], 25 kilometers northeast of central Baku, and was renowned for its thirteenth-century Shia shrine. Unlike the rest of the country which was staunchly secular and which can be considered religiously progressive, Nardaran was the only place in the whole of Azerbaijan where its inhabitants are devoutly religious and [[fundamentalist]], where its streets display religious banners and where most women wear [[chador]]s in public. The now banned [[Islamic Party of Azerbaijan]] was founded in this town and its base was centered there.

There is some evidence of Sufism in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=aleskerova&gt;{{cite web|last1=ALESKEROVA|first1=Nesrin|title=SUFISM IN AZERBAIJAN|url=http://www.ca-c.org/c-g/2007/journal_eng/c-g-4/11.shtml|publisher=CA &amp; CC Press|accessdate=24 May 2015|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic revival===
[[Image:Mosque in Baku.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A Mosque in [[Baku]].]]
[[File:GOBUSTAN MOSQ.jpg|thumb|200px|A stone-age cave converted into a Mosque in [[Qobustan, Baku|Gobustan]], [[Azerbaijan]].]]

Gradually, during the Soviet imperial twilight, signs of religious reawakening not only multiplied but surfaced into the open. According to Soviet sources, during the late 1970s around 1,000 clandestine houses of prayer were in use, and some 300 places of pilgrimage were identifiable. This growth proved the prelude to the public openings of hundreds of mosques in the following decade.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Beginning in the late Gorbachev period, and especially after independence, the number of mosques rose dramatically. Many were built with the support of other Islamic countries, such as [[Iran]], [[Oman]], and [[Saudi Arabia]], which also contributed [[Qur'an]]s and religious instructors to the new Muslim states. A Muslim seminary has also been established since 1991.  The growing number of religious Muslims resulted in the establishment of more than 2,000 mosques by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allahşükür Paşazadə: "Sovet dövründə Azərbaycanda 17 məscid olub, bu gün isə 2000-ə yaxın məscid, habelə kilsə və sinaqoqlar var"|url=http://az.apa.az/news/345306|website=az.apa.az|accessdate=18 October 2014|language=Azerbaijani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vəhhabilər Komitə sədrinə|url=http://politika.az/karusel/print:page,1,189-vehhabiler-dini-komite-sedrine.html|website=politika.az|accessdate=18 October 2014|language=Azerbaijani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After independence, the laws regarding religion are quite clear. In Article 7 of the constitution, Azerbaijan is declared a secular state. This point is driven home in Article 19 with the statement of the separation of religion and state and the equality of all religions before the law as well as the secular character of the state educational system.

Azerbaijan has been a [[secular]] country.&lt;ref name="silkroadstudies.org"&gt;[http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/Silkroadpapers/0610Azer.pdf Svante E. Cornell. The Politicization of Islam in Azerbaijan.]&lt;/ref&gt; A 1998 survey estimated the proportion of ardent believers in Azerbaijan at close to 7 percent, slightly more than the number of declared atheists — almost 4 percent — with the largest numbers falling into the category of those who consider Islam above all as a way of life, without strict observance of prohibitions and requirements, or as a fundamental part of national identity.&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"/&gt;  In a 2010 survey only half of Azerbaijanis answering yes to the question, "Is religion an important part of your daily life?"&lt;ref name=gallup/&gt;

Secular politicians in Azerbaijan have raised concerns about the rise of political Islam, but others argue that Islam in Azerbaijan is a multifaceted phenomenon. Islam plays only a very limited role in the political sphere and only a small part of the population supports the idea of establishing an "Islamic order". This is due to the long tradition of secularism in Azerbaijan and to the fact that the nationalistic opposition movement is secular in character. Yet, according to some analysts, on the longer run,  if the politicians do not manage to improve the conditions of life of the vast majority of the people, the population may express its discontent through political Islam.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Radical Islam==
{{Main article|Terrorism in Azerbaijan}}
There is a certain rise of [[religious extremism]] across the Azerbaijan as a result of continued problems such as corruption, poverty, and government rule, combined with disillusionment with the [[West]] and support of [[religious sect]]s from different countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/021306Azerbaijan.shtml Azerbaijani Jews worried over increasing radical Islamists, By Amiram Barkat, Haaretz - 02.15.2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4411524.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Azeri poverty fuels rise of Islam|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L08191665.htm|title=Thomson Reuters Foundation|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rferl.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1060479.html|title=Azerbaijan: Does Wahhabism Pose A Threat?|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it works against a headwind of traditional secularism. According to [[Svante Cornell]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Azerbaijan can rightly claim to be among the most progressive and secular Islamic societies. Aside from having been the first Muslim country to have operas, theater plays, and a democratic republic, Azerbaijan today is among the Muslim countries where support for secularism is the highest, and where radical ideologies have met only very limited interest.&lt;ref name="silkroadstudies.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Svante Cornell believes that the radical groups remain weak, but have a potential to grow under the current domestic and international circumstances. To confront this, the Azerbaijani state needs to address the diarchy in terms of supervision of religious structures.&lt;ref name="silkroadstudies.org"/&gt; He writes, that the Government policies toward Islam in general and Islamic radicalism in particular have been inadequate.&lt;ref name="silkroadstudies.org"/&gt;

According to researchers Emil Souleimanov and Maya Ehrmann, there is "a trend among [[Dagestan#Ethnicities|Dagestani]] minorities in the north of Azerbaijan to engage in insurgent activities".  The Salafi movement has been "spurred by missionary activities using external funds and the establishment of mosques", and found support from those who the desire a return to more traditionalist values.

{{islam by country}}
'''Islam''' has been well established in what is now known as [[Madagascar]] for centuries and today Muslims represent 7% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ma.html The World Factbook - Madagascar]&lt;/ref&gt; Vast majority of Muslims in Madagascar practice [[Sunni Islam]] of the [[Shafi]] school of [[jurisprudence]], with a smaller population of [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]]s who first established themselves in the country in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahmadiyya Muslim Mosques around the world | page=76 | accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the increasingly harassed, by Sunni fundamentalists and Shia Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;http://shiawaves.com/english/world/3651-shia-rights-watch-sectarian-crimes-against-shia-merchants-in-madagascar&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Settlement of Arabs===
{{Further|Sorabe alphabet}}
Beginning in the 10th or 11th century, [[Arab]] and [[Zanzibari]] [[ivory]] [[merchant]]s working their way down the east coast of Africa in their [[dhow]]s and established settlements on the west coast of Madagascar. The most noteworthy of these were the [[Zafiraminia]], traditional ancestors of the [[Antemoro]], [[Antanosy]] and other east coast ethnicities. The last wave of Arab immigrants would be the Antalaotra who immigrated from eastern African colonies. They settled the north-west of the island ([[Majunga]] area) and were the first to actually bring [[Islam]] to the island.

Arab immigrants were few in total number compared to the Indonesians and Bantus, but they left a lasting impression. The Malagasy names for seasons, months, days, and coins are Arabic in origin, as is the practice of [[circumcision]], the communal grain pool, and different forms of salutation. The Arab magicians, known as the ''ombiasy,'' established themselves in the courts of many Malagasy tribal kingdoms. Arab immigrants brought their patriarchal system of family and clan of non Islamic civilization rule to Madagascar, which differed from the [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] matriarchal system whereby rights of privilege and property are conferred equally on men and women. [[Sorabe]] is an alphabet based on Arabic used to transcribe the [[Malagasy language]] and the Antemoro dialect in particular. The Arabs were also the first to correctly identify the origin of most Malagasy by suggesting that the island was colonized by the [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juancole.com/2005/06/history-and-genetics-in-madagascar.html Informed Comment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonization and Independence===
[[File:Mosquée Antsirabe.JPG|thumb|left|[[Antsirabe]] mosquée]]
Upon independence from [[French Madagascar|France]] in 1960, Madagascar began developing close ties with staunchly [[secular]] power the [[Soviet Union]]. This stifled the development of all religion in Madagascar. However, in the 1980s, Madagascar drifted away from the Soviet Union and back towards France.

Followers constitute approximately 7% of the population, according to the US Department of State in 2011,&lt;ref name=BGNote&gt;{{cite web |last = Bureau of African Affairs |title = Background Note: Madagascar |publisher = U.S. Department of State |date = 3 May 2011 |url = https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5460.htm |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/61Be3ZCkK |archivedate = 24 August 2011  |accessdate =24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Down from their earlier estimate of 10 to 15% in 2009&lt;ref name=DeptOfState2009a&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127241.htm|title=Madagascar|publisher=US Department of State|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or 3% according to the [[Pew Research Center]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=pew/&gt;

The history of '''Jainism in Africa''' is relatively short when compared with the histories of [[Jews and Judaism in Africa|Judaism]], [[Christianity in Africa|Christianity]] and [[Islam in Africa|Islam]] on the same continent. There are about 20,000 Jains and around 10 Jain organizations in Africa.{{Sfn|Dundas|2002|p=271}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3s1vxWrqohMC&amp;pg=PR10|edition=2 |title=Jainism: The World of Conquerors|first=Natubhai|last=Shah|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|date=1998 |isbn=9781898723974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jainism entered Africa during the late 19th century, when Jains first emigrated from India to Kenya, and then to Uganda, Sudan and Tanzania.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=loQkEIf8z5wC|p=263 |title=Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence|first1=Kurt |last1=Titze|first2=Klaus |last2=Bruhn|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publication |isbn=9788120815346 |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exodus of Asians from Uganda in 1972 due to [[Idi Amin]]'s policies forced some Jains to migrate elsewhere, like Australia,&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5_EdL2FtIqQC|p=88 |title=Jainism and Early Buddhism: Essays in Honor of Padmanabh S. Jaini|publisher=Jain Publishing Company| first=Olle|last= Qvarnström |isbn=9780895819567 |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism in Kenya==
Jainism in Kenya has been present for about 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jAcXAAAAIAAJ |title=Kenya churches handbook: the development of Kenyan Christianity, 1498-1973|first=David B.|last=Barrett|publisher=Evangel Publication House |year=1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is practiced by a small community that actively organizes Jain conventions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-72919/jain-convention-takes-places-nairobi |title=Jain Convention Takes Places In Nairobi |publisher=The Star |date=2011-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; film festivals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jabbal |first=Harleen |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201212120701.html |title=Kenya: Young Jains of Nairobi's Film Show |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=2012-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other community programs.

There are Jain temples in [[Nairobi]] and [[Mombasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=epbpZJoiEAUC|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Kenya: Kenya|first=Philip |last=Briggs|publisher=DK Publishing |date= 2011-09-01 |isbn=9780756684457|p=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jains are among the most successful and prosperous businessmen in Nairobi and other bigger towns.{{sfn|J.N.K. Mugambi|2010|p=108}}

==Jainism in South Africa==
Jains emigrated to South Africa under British colonial rule in India and South Africa, and exceeded in trade and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VwsbJgJX84cC|p=117 |title=Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Jainism|first1=Suresh K.|last1=Sharma|first2=Usha|last2=Sharma |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=9788170999577 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high number of Jain tourists, in addition to the resident Jain community, many South African restaurants offer [[Jain food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/interview_many-sa-hotels-offer-jain-veg-cuisine_1227869 |title=Many SA hotels offer Jain, veg cuisine - India - DNA |publisher=DNA India |date=2009-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Jewish Telegraph''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Jew]]ish [[newspaper]].  It was founded in December 1950 by Frank and [[Vivienne Harris (businesswoman)|Vivienne Harris]], the parents of the current Editor, [[Paul Harris (editor)|Paul Harris]]. 

==Founding==
Frank and [[Vivienne Harris (businesswoman)|Vivienne Harris]] founded the newspaper in the [[dining room]] of their home in the [[City of Salford]] in December 1950.&lt;ref name=men&gt; {{cite news |first=Alice|last=McKeegan|title=Founder of Jewish Telegraph, Vivienne Harris, dies aged 89 |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1410461_founder_of_jewish_telegraph_vivienne_harris_dies_aged_89|work=[[Manchester Evening News]] |publisher=|date=2011-03-10 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Harris was a London [[freelance]] journalist who, on his arrival in [[Manchester]], noticed the fact that the city’s only Jewish newspaper was a [[freesheet]].  He determined, against all advice, to establish a Jewish [[weekly newspaper|weekly]]. 

==Expansion==
Vivienne Harris oversaw the newspaper's expansion from 1950 to 2011.&lt;ref name=men/&gt; Under her guidance, the ''Jewish Telegraph'' established editions in four major British cities - [[Manchester]], [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=men/&gt;

In 1976, the ''Jewish Telegraph'' decided to widen its field of coverage and established a separate [[Leeds]] edition with its own [[editorial]] and advertising staff and office in that city.  A staff of nine is maintained there.

In 1981, the ''Jewish Telegraph'' expanded further, acquiring the title of the monthly ''[[Liverpool Jewish Gazette]]'', immediately giving [[Merseyside]], for the first time, its own Jewish weekly. The ''Jewish Telegraph'' has its own editorial staff in [[Liverpool]], based in offices at Harold House, the Liverpool [[Jewish Community Centre]]. These offices moved into the new King David Campus in September 2011.

In June 1992, on the demise of the ''[[Glasgow Jewish Echo]]'', the ''Jewish Telegraph'' moved into [[Scotland]] within a week and began to produce a weekly edition. A staff of four works from office accommodations at the Glasgow Maccabi complex.

The latest addition to the ''Jewish Telegraph'' was in December 1999 with the introduction of a website, which is entirely updated in the early hours of every Friday morning.  The paper is currently headquartered in Park Hill, Bury Old Road in [[Prestwich]].&lt;ref name=bt&gt; {{cite news |first=|last=|title=Tributes to paper pioneer Vivienne|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1410461_founder_of_jewish_telegraph_vivienne_harris_dies_aged_89|work=[[Bury Times]] |publisher=|date=2011-03-10 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism offers a variety of views regarding the love of God, love among human beings, and love for non-human animals.  Love is a central value in [[Jewish ethics]] and [[Jewish theology]].

== Love among human beings ==
One of the core commandments of Judaism is "Love your neighbor as yourself"  (Leviticus 19:18), sometimes called the [[Great Commandment]].  This commandment stands at the center of the central book in the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Bamberger 1981: 737, 889&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Talmud]]ic sages Hillel and [[Rabbi Akiva]] indicated that this is the central commandment of the Torah. The commandment emboldens individuals to treat each other as equals which requires first valuing oneself in order to be able to mirror that love onto others. Similarly, another significant commandment is to “not stand idly by the blood of your neighbor” (Leviticus 19:16), which can be exhibited in many forms. Some Jewish sources have emphasized the importance of self-sacrifice in regards to putting our needs second to another's, but Rabbi Akiva's teaching of "Your own life takes precedence to that of another," contradicts his own principle of loving thy neighbor as thyself.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Lenn Evan. ''Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself''. Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2008, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

This commandment of love, with the preceding sentence, "Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people," may originally have referred, and has by some scholars (Stade, "Gesch. des Volkes Israel," i. 510a) been exclusively referred, to the Israelitish neighbor; but in verse 34 of the same chapter it is extended to "the stranger that dwelleth with you . . . and thou shalt love him as thyself." In Job xxxi. 13–15 it is declared unjust to wrong the servant in his cause: "Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?"&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1509&amp;letter=B Brotherly Love]. JewishEncyclopedia.com. Retrieved on 2014-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romantic love is included in the command to love one's neighbor, but romantic love ''per se'' is not a central topic in classical Jewish literature.  Some medieval rabbinic authorities such as [[Judah Halevi]] wrote romantic poetry in Arabic, though some say that Halevi regretted his romantic poetry, which he wrote in his younger years.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Classical rabbinic literature===
Commenting upon the command to love the neighbor (Lev. l.c.) is a discussion recorded (Sifra, Ḳedoshim, iv.; compare Gen. R. xxiv. 5) between [[Rabbi Akiva]], who declared this verse in Leviticus to contain the great principle of the Law ("Kelal gadol ba-Torah"), and [[Ben Azzai]], who pointed to Gen. v. 1 ("This is the book of the generations of Adam; in the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him"), as the verse expressing the leading principle of the Law, obviously because the first verse gives to the term "neighbor" its unmistakable meaning as including all men as being sons of Adam, made in the image of God. Tanḥuma, in [[Genesis Rabbah]] l.c., explains it thus: "If thou despisest any man, thou despisest God who made man in His image."&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt;

Hillel also took the Biblical command in this universal spirit when he responded to the heathen who requested him to tell the Law while standing before him on one foot: "What is hateful to thee, thou shalt not do unto thy neighbor. This is the whole of the Law, the rest is only commentary" (Shab. 31a). The negative form was the accepted Targum interpretation of Lev. xix. 18, known alike to the author of Tobit iv. 15 and to Philo, in the fragment preserved by Eusebius, "Preparatio Evangelica," viii. 7 (Bernays' "Gesammelte Abhandlungen," 1885, i. 274 et seq.); to the Didache, i. 1; Didascalia or Apostolic Constitutions, i. 1, iii. 15; Clementine Homilies, ii. 6; and other ancient patristic writings (Resch, "Agrapha," pp.&amp;nbsp;95, 135, 272). To include all men, Hillel used the term "beriot" (creatures [compare κτίσις]; Mark xvi. 15; Rom. viii. 19) when inculcating the teaching of love: "Love the fellow-creatures" (Abot i. 12). Hatred of fellow-creatures ("sinat ha-beriyot") is similarly declared by R. Joshua b. Hananiah to be one of the threethings that drive man out of the world (Abot ii. 11; compare I John iii. 15).&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt;

The Talmud insists, with reference to Lev. xix. 18, that even the criminal at the time of execution should be treated with tender love (Sanh. 45a). As Schechter in "J. Q. R." x. 11, shows, the expression "Ye have heard . . ." is an inexact translation of the rabbinical formula, which is only a formal logical interrogation introducing the opposite view as the only correct one: "Ye might deduce from this verse that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy, but I say to you the only correct interpretation is, Love all men, even thine enemies."&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt; According to Ahad Ha-am, the Torah's phrasing of "thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" is negative because it creates a "perfect equilibirum, with no leaning either to your side or to your neighbour's."&lt;ref&gt;Ha-Am, Ahad. “Judaism and the Gospels.” ''In Ten Essays on Zionism and Judaism'', translated by Leon Simon, 241. New York: Arno Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tanna debe Eliyahu]] R. xv. it is said: "Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: 'Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.'" Likewise in xxviii.: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God"; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare [[Sifre]], Deut. 32).&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt;

===Kabbalistic and Hasidic sources===
[[Ḥayyim Vital]], the [[kabbalist]], in his "Sha'are Ḳedushah," i. 5 teaches that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt;  A similar view was taught by Aaron b. Abraham ibn Ḥayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre and by Moses Ḥagis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt;

One of the main tenets of [[Hasidic philosophy|Hassidut]] is that all that everything in the universe exists only because the Creator wills it to exist. Therefore, the existence of even the most vile and wicked human beings are a manifestation of Hashem's will, and ultimately, their physical survival is due to that same divine energy that allows the entire creation to survive. And even though it is indeed a positive commandment to despise evil, the true [[tzaddik]] understands that the existence of even the most wicked human beings are in accordance with the Creator's will. This understanding is tantamount to love, as it stems from a love of Hashem and his ways. According to [[Nachman of Breslov|R' Nachman]], this is the ''sod'' of "[[Purim|Ad delo yada bein arur Haman le'varuch Mordechai]]".

Some Jews, however, have criticized Kabbalistic and Hasidic views of love.

===Musar movement===
One of the leaders of the Musar movement, Rabbi [[Simcha Zissel Ziv]], put much emphasis on love.

A later Musar movement leader, the 20th-century rabbi [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] is frequently quoted as defining love from the Jewish point-of-view as "giving without expecting to take" (''Kuntres ha-Chesed'', Heb. קונטרס החסד Pamphlet [on the topic] of [[Chessed|Lovingkindness]] from his ''Michtav me-Eliyahu'', vol. I).

===Modern Jewish views===
The synod at Leipsic in 1869, and the German-Israelitish Union of Congregations in 1885, stood on old historical ground when declaring that "'Love thy neighbor as thyself' is a command of all-embracing love, and is a fundamental principle of the Jewish religion."&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, ''Ethics of Judaism'', i. 234, 302&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Jewish Debates on Love and Justice===
The 20th-century Jewish theologian [[Will Herberg]] argued that "justice" is at the heart of the Jewish notion of love, and the foundation for Jewish law: 
:The ultimate criterion of justice, as of everything else in human life, is the divine imperative—the law of love .... Justice is the institutionalization of love in society .... This law of love requires that every man be treated as a Thou, a person, an end in himself, never merely as a thing or a means to another's end.  When this demand is translated into laws and institutions under the conditions of human life in history, justice arises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Herberg]], ''Judaism and Modern Man'', 1951: 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish tradition often encourages the elimination of “otherness” instead for all to see each other as moral counterparts and emphasizes the obligation to render aid and intervene autonomously, doing the right thing because it’s right, not in a heteronomous way, doing the right thing because we feel we must. The tradition teaches not to simply love, but to tolerate in order to be able to achieve justice.

Contemporary rabbi [[Jill Jacobs (rabbi)|Jill Jacobs]] has emphasized that the limits of love as a motivation for giving to others.  As a way to extend one's hand to the community, one can give Tzedakah, or charity, which comes from the word Tzedek meaning justice, compassion and mercy. As an obligation, one must give to the poor “as a means of restoring justice to the world…not as an altruistic or voluntary gesture.” A way to outwardly and tangibly exhibit love is by giving. For example, giving money out of “passion for causes, out of love or concern for others, out of gratitude for our own good fortune, and out of desire to create a better world for ourselves and our children.” By giving to the community, one can demonstrate love outwardly while also embracing it inwardly.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Jill. ''There shall be no needy: Pursuing Social Justice Through Jewish Law &amp; Tradition''''. ''Woodstock, Vt.: Jewish Lights, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Love has also been expressed as being the selflessness of mankind (Louis Jacobs, Greater Love Hath No Man). Humans have the capacity to self-sacrifice in the interest of others, as every life is valuable and unique. When one risks his or her own life to save another, it is seen as an act of piety and an act of love and justice which “advocates the most excessive altruism…” (Greater Love Hath No Man). In order to be selfless then, one must be able to “attach moral value to the individual as such, without any distinction between the self and the other.”&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Louis. “Greater Love Hath No Man: The Jewish Point of View of Self-Sacrifice.” In Contemporary Jewish Ethics, edited by Menachem Marc Kellner, 175-83. New York: Sanhedrin Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish tradition finds validity to the idea of love as well as the acts that supplement it. These acts are centered on ideas widely associated with love in many different traditions such as kindness, respect, compassion, and empathy.  There is inherent value to every soul because they are human. Rabbi Laurie Zoloth-Dorfman states, “The conscience can be said, then, not to be the speaking of the voice within but rather the hearing of the quiet voice of the other, this voice, just as clearly as one’s “own,” must remind us to see each child as our own, each journey and each need as fundamentally shared.” Rather than finding compassion within oneself, we are obligated to find compassion from our empathy and natural connectedness to others. This love for one’s neighbor because they are ones neighbor is an important theme seen in modern views of love in Jewish ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Zoloth -Dorfman, Laurie. “An Ethics of Encounter: Public Choices and Private Acts.” In Contemporary Jewish Ethics and Morality: A Reader, edited by Elliot N. Dorff and Louis E. Newman. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Love can be expressed in a myriad of ways in the Jewish tradition. One way is putting others before oneself. There are several arguments to do this, but one of the most compelling is because one does not know the value of their life.  Rabbi Louis Jacobs states, “But no human being can know which life is of greater value. Hence, it is forbidden to save one’s life by committing murder.”  Some interpretations state that each person is of different value based on a set of variables that are difficult to quantify. There is love to be found in sacrificing oneself because of an understanding that someone else’s life could be more valuable to the world or to God.  Rabbi David Novak states “Rather, many a Jewish source maintains that God affords every human being the opportunity to choose his or her moral fate, and will then judge him or her, and choose whether to love him or her, on the basis of that decision.” In this way, God can decide whether to love a person based on their decisions in the same way a person can choose to love another person.  This idea of God with holding love is not necessarily the predominant one in the modern Jewish tradition, but it is an important concept in the discussion of love and Jewish ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, David. “A Jewish Argument for Socialized Medicine.” Kennedy Institute of
Ethics Journal 13, no. 4 (2004): 313 –28. Jacobs, Louis. “Greater Love Hath No Man... The Jewish Point of View on Self-Sacrifice.” In Contemporary Jewish Ethics, edited by Menachem Marc Kellner, 175–83. New York: Sanhedrin Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Love for animals==

Some Jewish sources also highlight the importance of love and compassion for non-human animals.  Thus, for example, the Jewish philosopher Lenn Goodman speaks of how laws regarding the suffering of animals ideally "create a sensibility of love and kindness."&lt;ref&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman, "Respect for Nature in the Jewish Tradition," in ''Judaism and Ecology: Created World and Revealed Word'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Hava Tirosh-Samuelson, a Jewish historian believed that at the core of Judaism the covenantal model between the Jewish people, God, and the Land of Israel, explains our “obligation to respond to the needs of the other."&lt;ref&gt;Benstein, Jeremy. ''The Way into Judaism and the Environment''. Woodstock, Vt: Jewish Lights, 2006, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Tirosh-Samuelson thought about the possible meanings when this model was expanded to include the earth as a whole, showing the importance of treating all living creatures with respect. There is a story in the Talmud on how [[Judah HaNasi]] was struck with pain because he did not show mercy to a calf being led to slaughter, and only after saving a mouse's nest he was forgiven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/treatment-of-animals/ Treatment of animals], Times of Israel 19-06-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Love between God and human beings==

Deuteronomy 6: 4–5 commands: "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God; the Lord is one.  You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might."

===Classical rabbinic literature===
The commandment to love God in Deut. 6 is taken by the [[Mishnah]] (a central text of the Jewish [[oral law]]) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all one's possessions and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5, tractate Sanhedrin 74a). [[Rabbinic literature]] differs how this love can be developed.

The love of God means the surrounding of life with his commandments (Men. 43b) and is conditioned by the love of the Torah (R. H. 4a).  Israel is said to love him, giving their very lives for the observance of his commandments (Mek., Yitro, 6, to Ex. xx. 6). Indeed, love of God is voluntary surrender of life and all one has for God's honor (Sifre, Deut. 32; Ber. 54a). It is unselfish service of God (Abot i. 3; 'Ab Zarah 19a). There are chastisements of love for the righteous to test their piety (Ber. 5a; comp. Rom. v. 3). It is this unequaled love, braving suffering and martyrdom, which established the unique relation between God and Israel, so that "none of the nations can quench this love" (Cant. R. viii. 7). This unique love is echoed also in the liturgy (see Ahabah Rabbah). To be a true "lover of God," however, means "to receive offense, and resent not; to hear words of contumely, and answer not; to act merely from love, and rejoice even in trials as tests of pure love" (Shab. 88b; Soṭah 31a; comp. Rom. viii. 28).&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=562&amp;letter=L LOVE]. JewishEncyclopedia.com. Retrieved on 2014-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahya Ibn Pakuda===
Love of God is accentuated as the highest incentive of action by [[Baḥya ibn Paḳuda]], in "Ḥobot ha-Lebabot" (see Jew. Encyc. ii. 454).&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt; In ''Duties of the Heart'', the Jewish philosopher maintained that love of God is the ultimate goal and must be the aim of all virtues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Judaism: History, Belief and Practice|last=Cohn-Sherbok|first=Dan|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|isbn=9780415236614|location=New York|pages=444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahya defined this love as the soul's longing for the creator and this is also made possible through the fear of God, which allows people to abstain from worldly desires.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It appears that fear is linked to love in the sense that it stems from the contemplation of God's power and greatness, which could result to emotional attachment seen in parts of the [[Psalms|Psalm]] and elsewhere in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Judaism|last=de Lange|first=Nicholas|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521460735|location=Cambridge|pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a religious person empties himself of the love for material things, he then opens himself up to be filled with the love of God. These arguments led some observers to describe Bahya's concept of love towards the creator as more focused on the emotion instead of putting emphasis on the [[Rationality|rational]] or [[Mysticism|mystical]] aspects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Love towards other people and even animals could fall within Bahya's framework when approached from his view that we cannot know God as He is in Himself and that it is only through his creatures that we can gain an apprehension of the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fifty Key Jewish Thinkers|last=Cohn-Sherbock|first=Dan|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=0203433025|location=London|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maimonides===
Maimonides, in his [[Mishneh Torah]], devotes the whole tenth chapter of Hilkot Teshubah, with reference to Abot i. 3, to love of God as the motive which gives all human action its true ethical and religious value. [[Maimonides]] wrote that it should only be out of love for God, rather than fear of punishment or hope for reward, that Jews should obey the law: "When man loves God with a love that is fitting he automatically carries out all the precepts of love".&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides ''Yad'' Chapter 10, quoted in Jacobs 1973: 159&lt;/ref&gt; Maimonides thinks that love of God can be developed by contemplating Divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature ([[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', Hilchot Yesoday HaTorah, Chapter 2).

===Nahmanides===
[[Naḥmanides]] in his commentary to Deut. vi. 4, with reference to Sifre, l.c., declares that love of God involves the study and observance of the Law without regard to gain or expectation of reward; so also Baḥya ben Asher, in his "Kad ha-Ḳemaḥ," under "Ahabah."&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt;

===Eleazar of Worms===
R. [[Eleazar of Worms]], in his ethical work "Roḳeaḥ," begins with the chapter on love, referring to Sifre, Deut. 32, 41, 48; Ber. 54a; Yoma 86a; Ned. 62a; Soṭah 31a; Tanna debe Eliyahu xxvi.; Midr. Teh. to Ps. xiii. 2 ("I love Thee; that is, 'I love Thy creatures'"); and Midr. Tadshe xii., and stating that he who truly loves God subordinates all other desires and cares to the one great object of life—the fulfilment of God's will in joy.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt;

===Kabbalistic views===
Still more extensively does [[Elijah de Vidas]], in his ethical work "Reshit Ḥokmah" (part 2), dwell on love of God as the highest aim and motive of life. He also quotes the Zohar (i. 11b; ii. 114, 116a; iii. 68a, 264b, 267a; and other passages), where it is frequently stated that pure love is suppression of all care for self, and through such love true union of the soul with God is effected. This union is said by the [[Kabbalists]] to take place in the celestial "palace of love" (Zohar i. 44b, ii. 97a).&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt;

===Crescas===
Still greater importance was attached to love when it was rendered a cosmic principle in the philosophical systems of [[Hasdai Crescas]] and, through him, of [[Spinoza]]. Instead of rendering the creative intellect the essence of the Deity, as did [[Maimonides]] and all the [[Aristotelians]], [[Crescas]], like [[Philo]], makes love the essential quality of God. Love is divine bliss, and hence love of God is the source of eternal bliss for mortal man.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Or Adonai," i. 3, 5; comp. Spinoza's "Amor Intellectualis," v. 32–36; see Joël, "Don Chasdai Creskas' Religionsphilosophische Lehren," 1866, p. 37; idem, "Spinoza's Theologisch-Politischer Tractat," 1870, pp. ix.-xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judah Leon Abravanel===
But, more than Crescas, it was probably [[Judah Leon Abravanel]] from whom Spinoza borrowed the idea of "intellectual love" as a cosmic principle, and who, following the Platonic and pantheistic tendency of the period of the Italian Renaissance, made (in his "Dialoghi di Amore") the "amore intellectivo" and "amore mentale" or "rationale" the essence of God and the central force and end of the world. "Love links all things together in the cosmos, but while love in the natural world is sensual and selfish, divine love is unselfish and uplifting. God's love created the world and brings about the perfection of all things, especially of man, who, when good, is God-loving as well as God-beloved, and whose love of God leads him to eternal bliss, which is identical with divine love." This intellectual love is identical with the Biblical "to him [God] shalt thou cleave" (Deut. x. 20, xi. 22, xiii. 5; Sifre, Deut. 49; Soṭah 14a) and gives rise to the "imitatio Dei." It is highest perfection and supreme joy&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Zimmels, "Leo Hebræus," 1886, especially pp. 51, 67, 74–79, 89–100&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abravanel]]'s view of love as the principle of the world appears to have exerted some influence also upon Schiller in his "Philosophische Briefe" (1838, x. 289)&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmels, l.c. pp. 8–11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franz Rosenzweig===
{{Cleanup|section|date=December 2010}}
The 20th-century Jewish philosopher [[Franz Rosenzweig]] described divine love as cleansing:

:It is not God that need cleanse it [the soul of the beloved, i.e. Israel] of its sin.  Rather it cleanses itself in the presence of his love.  It is certain of God's love in the very moment that shame withdraws from it and it surrenders itself in free, present admission — as certain as if God had spoken into its ear that "I forgive" which is longed for earlier when it confessed to him its sins of the past.  It no longer needs this formal absolution.  It is freed of its burden at the very moment of daring to assume all of it on its shoulders.  So too the beloved no longer needs the acknowledgment of the lover which she longed for before she admitted her love.  At the very moment when she herself dares to admit it, she is as certain of his love as if he were whispering his acknowledgment into her ear.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenzweig described the Hebrew Bible as a "grammar of love" in which God can communicate "I love you" only by demanding "You must love me," and Israel can communicate "I love you" only by confessing "I have sinned."  Therefore, this confession does not lead God to offer an unnecessary absolution; it merely expresses Israel's love for God.  "What then is God's answer to this 'I am thine' by which the beloved soul acknowledges him" if it is not "absolution?"  Rosenzweig's answer is: revelation: "He cannot make himself known to the soul before the soul has acknowledged him.  But now he must do so.  For this it is by which revelation first reaches completion.  In its groundless presentness, revelation must now permanently touch the ground."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, 182&lt;/ref&gt;  Revelation, epitomized by Sinai, is God's response to Israel's love.  Contrary to Paul, who argued that "through the law comes knowledge of sin",&lt;ref&gt;Romans 3: 20&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenzweig argues that it is because of and after a confession of sin that God reveals to Israel knowledge of the law.

Rosenzweig believes that for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbis]], Song of Songs provides a paradigm for understanding the love between God and Israel, a love that "is strong as death".&lt;ref&gt;Song of Songs 8:6; Rosenzweig, 202&lt;/ref&gt;  God's love is as strong as death because it is love for the People Israel, and it is as a collective that Israel returns God's love.  Thus, although one may die, God and Israel, and the love between them, lives on.  In other words, Song of Songs is "the focal book of revelation"&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, 202&lt;/ref&gt; where the "grammar of love" is most clearly expressed. But this love that is as strong as death ultimately transcends itself, as it takes the form of God's law — for it is the law that binds Israel as a people, and through observance of the law that each Jew relives the moment of revelation at Mt. Sinai.  Ultimately, Song of Songs points back to Leviticus's command to love one's neighbor as oneself and to the rest of the Torah.

Through the revelation of God's commandments, in Rosenzweig's view, the love portrayed in Song of Songs becomes the love commanded in Leviticus.  Just as love for the Children of Israel is one of the ways that God is present in the world, the necessary response by the Jews — the ''way'' to love God in return — is to extend their own love out towards their fellow human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, 203–204&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7985">'''Justus Doolittle''' ({{zh|t=盧公明|s=卢公明}}; [[Pinyin]]: ''Lú Gōngmíng''; [[Foochow Romanized]]: ''Lù Gŭng-mìng''; June 23, 1824, [[Rutland, New York|Rutland]], [[New York (state)|New York]] - June 15, 1880, [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) was an [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions|American Board]] missionary to [[China]].

==Life==
Justus Doolittle was born in [[Rutland, New York|Rutland]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on June 23, 1824. In 1846 he graduated from [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], and in 1849 from [[Auburn Theological Seminary]]. Having deliberately chosen [[China]] as his field of labor, he sailed for [[Fuzhou]] with his wife soon after graduation, and arrived there on May 31. In February, 1864, he left China for a visit to the [[United States]] on account of his health. In 1872 he entered the service of the [[American Presbyterian Mission|Presbyterian Board]] at [[Shanghai]], but was soon compelled to return home disabled. On June 15, 1880, he died in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He is buried in Sunset Hill Cemetery, Clinton, NY.&lt;ref&gt;Details, with photograph https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=128850281&lt;/ref&gt;

Doolittle was most famous for his '''''Social Life of the Chinese''''' (Volume [https://books.google.com/books?id=ao0IAAAAQAAJ 1] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=ksZAyOrepTMC 2]), a thorough and valuable work on the details of Chinese life. He also had a significant collection of Chinese coins, which was sold in June 1881.&lt;ref&gt;https://chinesemoneymatters.wordpress.com/2017/08/01/collector-justus-doolittle-1824-1880/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870-71 he accompanied the photographer [[John Thomson (photographer)|John Thomson]]. Thomson's photographs of this journey were published as ''Foochow and the River Min'' (1873), a total of 46 copies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/2013/early-photographs-of-china-make-treble-estimate-at-sothebys/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Doolittle published prolifically in a wide range of journals, including ''[[Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal]]'', of which he was briefly an editor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13757">'''Kaharingan''' is a [[folk religion]] professed by many [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] in [[Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]]; particularly Central Kalimantan, although many have converted to [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]]. The word means life, and this belief system includes a concept of a supreme deity—although this may be the result of the need to conform to the idea of "One Supreme God" (''Ketuhanan yang Maha Esa''), which is the first principle of the Indonesian state ideology [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]. [[Hindu]]-Javanese influence can be seen in this religion, and the Indonesian government views it as a form of [[Hinduism]] because the Indonesian government recognizes only [[Religion in Indonesia|six official religions]], and Kaharingan is not one of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Audrey|title=Borneo Tribe Practices Its Own Kind of Hinduism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/world/asia/borneo-tribe-practices-its-own-kind-of-hinduism.html?pagewanted=all&amp;action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults%230&amp;version=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry62%23%2FDayak|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CQZ_AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Kaharingan+hindu Anthropos, Volume 102, Issue 2], Österreichische Leo-Gesellschaft, Görres-Gesellschaft, Anthropos Institute; Zaunrith'sche Buch-, Kunst- und Steindruckerei, 2007, ''... It is remarkable to see how positive and self-conscious Kaharingans currently are in their interior villages. "We are Hindus," they proclaim. Likewise, people in Palangla Raya are proud of being part of a Hindu world community ...''&lt;/ref&gt; The main festival of Kaharingan is the ''[[Tiwah]]'' festival, which lasts for thirty days, and involves the sacrifice of many animals like buffaloes, cows, pigs and chickens, as offerings to the Supreme God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greer|first=Charles Douglas|title=Religions of Man: Facts, Fibs, Fears and Fables|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington, IN|year=2008|page=135|isbn=1-4389-0831-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supreme God in Kaharingan is called Ranying. In addition, the religion has ritual offerings called Yadnya, places of worship called Balai Basarah or Balai Kaharingan and a holy book called Panaturan, Talatah Basarah (group of prayers) and Tawar (a guide to seek God's help by giving rice).

==Overview==
[[File:Sandung 101013-7585 mp.JPG|thumb|''Sandung'' of Dayak Pesaguan people in [[Ketapang Regency]], [[West Kalimantan]].  Note a sculpture of a dragon above it ]]
[[File:Sandung 101101-8268 lap.JPG|thumb|''Sandung'' of Dayak Pebihingan people, side by side with two tombs.  Ketapang Regency]]
The term Kaharingan comes from the Old Dayak word "Haring" meaning "Life" or "Alive". This concept is expressed in the symbol of the faith depicting the Tree of Life. This Tree of Life resembles a [[spear]] that has three branches on eitherside, some facing up and some down. At the bottom of the symbol are two receptacles, while at the very top are a hornbill and the sun. The [[hornbill]] bird and the sun represent Ranying Mahalala meaning God Almighty, Source of all life on earth.

The spear and its branches denote the upper world and the afterlife, while the lower part where are the receptacles convey the idea of man’s earthly life. Although both the spiritual world and the earthly world are different, but they are closely connected to one another and are inseparable since they are both interdependent.

The branches where some face up while others face down mean that there is an eternal balance between the earthly and the afterlife. That life on earth is temporary, and that human life is designed for the hereafter.

Altogether the Tree of Life expresses the core of the Kaharingan faith, which is that Human Life must be a balance and kept in harmony between man and his fellow humans, between man and his natural environment, and between man and the Almighty. This is also the basic concept of the Balinese Hindu religion, where in Bali it is known as the [[Tri Hita Karana]].

In practice the Ngaju Dayaks focus on the supernatural world of spirits, including ancestral spirit. For them, the secondary funeral is most important, usually held after several months or even years after burial. During the second funeral rites (known as ''[[tiwah]]'') the bones are exhumed and cleansed then placed in a special [[mausoleum]], called sandung. The spirit of the deceased is then believed to watch over the village. The mausoleums are often beautifully decorated showing scenes of the upper world. An ornate ship of the dead made of [[rubber]] is usually placed next to the remains depiciting his entourage that accompany the soul to paradise.

One of the most outstanding features of the Dayak faith is their Local Wisdom and innate concern to preserve the forest and the natural environment. There are strict rules and directives on how to treat the rainforests, what may be done or taken from the forests and what are taboo. The Dayaks’ local wisdom directs that trespassing these rules will destroy the balance of the forest and animals living in the forest, and so directly or indirectly will adversely damage communities living from the forest bounty.

==Recognition by the Indonesian government==

Among the many tribes of Dayaks in Borneo, those living in the upper reaches of the rivers in the province of Central Kalimantan are the [[Ngaju people|Dayak Ngaju]], the [[Lawangan people|Lawangan]], the [[Ma'anyan people|Ma'anyan]] and the [[Ot Danum people|Ot Danum]], known as the Barito Dayaks, named after the large Barito river. The Ngaju, who inhabit the Kahayan river basin by the present city of Palangkaraya, are involved in agricultural commerce, planting [[rice]], [[cloves]], [[coffee]], [[palm oil]], [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], whilst, the other tribes still mostly practice subsistence farming through the slash and burn lifestyle. The Dayak Ngaju were more open to technological and cultural influences from outside than most other Dayak, even during precolonial times. With the arrival of the Dutch and - in 1835 - the missionary Rheinische Mission (later followed up by the Basler Mission, many converted to Christianity. The missionaries founded schools and increased the literacy rate. Education stimulated a 'national awakening' among the Ngaju and Ma'anyan Dayak.

Already long before the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Dayak founded nationalistic political parties. During the [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian battle for independence against the Dutch]], the Dayak from the Kalimantan region fought under Major Tjilik Riwut, a parachutist from the Ngaju Dayak who practiced the traditional religion. After the proclamation of independence, Jakarta decided that the Islamic Banjarmasin and mostly Dayak area west of it, should be one province. The plan got resistance from the Dayak - the Ngaju in front - which demanded a sole province. Under Riwut, which had become big during the revolution, the Dayak began a small guerrilla. The Indonesian army limited escalation of the conflict, probably because Riwut had been a loyal soldier. In 1957, the province of Kalimantan Tengah ("Central Kalimantan") or 'KalTeng' was officially formed by Presidential Law. The government was led by the Ngaju, and Rawit became governor. The 'battle' was about a sole province, together with a revaluation of the traditional Dayak culture, especially the religious part - a reaction on the worsening missionaries. The traditional religions of the [[Ngaju people|Ngaju]], [[Ot Danum people|Ot Danum]], [[Ma'anyan people|Ma'anyan]] and other Dayak was named Kaharingan ('power of life').

After the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] was declared illegal in the 1960s, the subject 'religion' became very sensitive. The state ideology saw religion as the belief in one God and the membership ow a 'acknowledged' world religion with a holy book. The Dayak were seen as 'atheists', which were highly associated with the communist ideology, and had to pick between two options: conversion to a world religion or being pressured by local authorities to do so. With this in mind; it is fairly clear why the missions with their schools, hospitals and minimal pressure, had much more success after the 1960s. Compared to the environments in the 17th and 18th century, Christianity offered more possibilities for social progress than Islam. Over time the ban on local religions was abandoned. In 1980, Kaharingan was officially recognised as religion, but only as a part of the Hindu Dharma, so in fact it was placed under Hinduism. In Central Kalimantan, a small minority does practice this religion.

==The carnival in the Jungle==

In the religion of the Ngaju, the supernatural world is important, in which also the souls of ancestors have their place. Just like among other Dayak, the Ngaju known ritual re-burial, which usually takes place several months (sometimes several years) after the initial burial. This re-burial is very important for the soul of the deceased, so it can reach the highest point in heaven. With practicing the rytes, they protect themselves against bad supernatural powers. The first funeral takes place just after someone has died. During this ceremony, masked dancers protect the deceased against the bad spirits. Guided by drums, the kaharingan-priests start singing, which will send the soul to heaven. On its journey in the traditional ship of souls it is accompanied by spirits. Once in heaven, which consists of several 'layers', the soul has to wait in the lowest layer until the re-burial takes place.

Picture: Sandung

During this second ritual (tiwah), the remainders of the deceased are excavated, cleaned and put in a special grave. These woodcarved and decorated graves often have the shape of a bird or watersnake and are decorated with images of the hereafter. Too bad sandung from the factory replace the traditional tombes. The tiwah is a big, complex and long lasting event. The cost vary between US$6,000 and US$12,000. It's common that several families hold a tiwah together, so they can spread the cost of sacrificed animals like a big number of waterbuffalo's and pigs. Once there were more than 200 souls brought to a higher level in one ceremony. But a tiwah also is a happy event. In the open air, foodstalls and shops are put up, and at some distance, there is also some gambling. The tiwah is the carnival of the jungle.

==Adaptions==

Sandung made of concrete are not the only changes in the Kaharingan religion. To make the religion acceptable for the government a council was set up, which had to control the theological and ritual activities of the about 330,000 supporters. None of the about 78 basir upu (top specialists about rites) are part of the council and also the about three hundred kaharingan priests are not in there as well. The council reflects aspects of the religion which are also known in other big religions. It also organises weekly meetings in specially built kaharingan-communal rooms, complete with speeches, prayers and psalms. Furthermore, the council registers and coordinates all tiwah (there are two to ten every year), before asking the police for a permit.

From early times the Iban believed that [[fighting cocks]] used by the supernatural, turned into human warriors and the [[cockfight (sacred)|cock fight]] is then closely tied with "intangible qualities of human nature, spiritual fulfillment and religious refinement"&lt;ref&gt;Iban Cultural Heritage&amp;nbsp;— The Early Iban Way of Life&amp;nbsp;— by Gregory Nyanggau 26th descendant of Sengalang Burong, the Iban God of War [http://gnmawar.wordpress.com/adat-iban/the-early-iban-way-of-life/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaman]]ic curing or ''balian'' is one of the core features of Kaharingan ritual practices. Because this healing practice often occurs as a result of the loss of a soul resulting in some kind of illness, the focus of this practice is thus on the body. Sickness comes by offending one of the many spirits inhabiting the earth and fields, usually from a failure to sacrifice to them. The goal of the balian is to call back the wayward soul and restore the health of the community through trance, dance, and possession.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">'''Kleśa''' ([[sanskrit]] क्लेश, also ''klesha'' ) is a term from Indian philosophy and [[yoga]], meaning a "poison". The third ''[[śloka]]'' of the second chapter of [[Patanjali|Patañjali]]'s ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yogasūtra]]'' explicitly identifies Five Poisons (Sanskrit: ''pañcakleśā''):

:अविद्यास्मितारागद्वेषाभिनिवेशाः पञ्च क्लेशाः॥३॥
:{{IAST|Avidyāsmitārāgadveṣābhiniveśāḥ pañca kleśāḥ}}&lt;ref name=patanjali&gt;Patañjali ''et al.'' (2007) Source: [http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit_pronunciation/pronunciation7.html] (accessed: November 23, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Translated into English, these five (pañca) Kleśa-s or Afflictions ({{IAST|kleśāḥ}}) are:&lt;ref name=patanjali /&gt;
* Ignorance (in the form of a misapprehension about reality) (ávidyā),
* egoism (in the form of an erroneous identification of the Self with the intellect) (asmitā),
* attachment (rāga),
* aversion ({{IAST|dveṣa}}), and
* fear of death (which is derived from clinging ignorantly to life) ({{IAST|abhiniveśāḥ}}).

This is a '''list of Methodist churches and campgrounds''', either of notable congregations or of notable buildings or campgrounds or others places of worship. This very limited list reflects historically interesting sites, and omits most of the very largest Methodist congregations.  Since the founding of [[Methodism]] in the mid-18th century, the movement has spread throughout the world, and remains a presence in many countries today.

Many church buildings are notable for their historical or architectural significance. Many of the historic churches can be found in the United Kingdom and the United States, but some are also located in Canada, China, Korea and other in countries where there has been a Methodist presence. In some cases the congregation which established the church has since disbanded but the building remains. This list is intended to comprehensively index notable Methodist churches world-wide.

==Canada==

Two [[British Methodist Episcopal Church]] churches have been designated [[National Historic Sites of Canada]] due to their roles in welcoming [[Underground Railroad]] refugees to Canada and their historic importance to the Black community in the [[Niagara peninsula|Niagara]] region:

==United Kingdom==

The first Methodist churches were in Norwich (1757), in Rotherham (1761), in Whitby (1762), and in Heptonstall (1764).

About 700 Methodist chapels in the United Kingdom have been identified as significant buildings for their architecture or history by author Ian Serjeant, who has served as Conservation Officer for the Methodist church since 1996.&lt;ref name=methodistarch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/methodistarch/methodistarch.htm |title=Historic Methodist Architecture and its Protection |author=Ian Serjeant |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of Methodist churches that are [[listed buildings]] was prepared by the U.K. Methodist church's division of property in 1976.&lt;ref name=methodistarch/&gt; A standing committee of the Methodist Church of Britain is charged with having "knowledge of the history, development and use of Methodist chapels, of Methodist liturgy and worship, or archaeology, of the history and the development of architecture and the visual arts, and the experience of the care of historic buildings and their contents", and to advise on about 250 renovation projects per year to the Methodist listed buildings.&lt;ref name="methodist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.methodist.org.uk/ministers-and-office-holders/property/technical-and-conservation/listed-buildings-advisory-committee |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503082538/http://www.methodist.org.uk/ministers-and-office-holders/property/technical-and-conservation/listed-buildings-advisory-committee |archive-date=3 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |title=The Methodist Church in Britain &amp;#124; Listed Buildings Advisory Committee |accessdate=9 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wesley]], the founder of Methodism, is said to have had a preference for octagonal buildings, as exemplified by the [[Heptonstall Methodist Church]] in West Yorkshire, England.&lt;ref name=methodistarch/&gt;

Appropriate style for Methodist church buildings was debated during the mid-1800s. Architect-trained Reverend [[Frederick Jobson]] argued for "beauty and perfection in design and execution without unnecessary adornment"; the governing body of Methodism adopted his works and Gothic architecture "became the predominant style, particularly within Wesleyan Methodism."&lt;ref name=methodistarch/&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, numerous Methodist churches are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on state and local historic registers, many of which reflect the values of plainness, of Gothic architecture, of simple adornment. The [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] style is also simple and came to be adopted for numerous American Methodist churches.

Several, selected significant Methodist churches in the U.S. are:

[[File:Святые Борис и Глеб.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Boris and Gleb]], the first canonized Russian saints]]
'''Saints in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]''' are confirmed by [[canonization]] which lists the decedent into the [[Sainthood|Community of Saints]]. After canonization, the saint is usually listed in the [[Menologium]]. The saint is honoured by illustrating him on [[icons]], mentioning him in kondaks or [[troparion]]s, narrating his achievements in the [[hagiography|Lives of Saints]], confirming a celebration date in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical calendar|Orthodox calendar]] and building churches and monasteries holding his name. The office of canonization is usually the last prayer to the departed ([[parastasa]], [[Memorial service (Orthodox)|pannychis]], [[Memorial service (Orthodox)#Lity|lity]]) and first prayer to the saint ([[all-night vigil]], [[moleben]], [[megalynarion]]).

Canonization is usually divided into two categories: local and church-wide. The church-wide canonization is always performed by the highest church organ, that is the [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow|Metropolitan or Patriarch]] above the Council of [[Eparch]]s, the chief member above the [[Most Holy Synod]] in the synodal period, or the [[Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia]] above the [[Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church]] in contemporary Russia. The local canonization is performed in either one church or monastery, or in one [[eparchy]], by the local [[episcopal polity|episcope]] with the approval of the Metropolitan or Patriarch and the highest church organ, to honour one person or people who are better known in a particular region. In cases when the local canonization was performed without the blessing of the highest church organ, the previous canonization process won't be annulled but will be performed again as it should be. Sometimes the Head of the Church himself or the [[Ecclesiastical province|metropolitanate]] accomplishes the local canonization. Both local and church-wide canonizations are honoured the same way; they should not be expressed as higher and lower canonizations. A saint can be both local and church-wide, and in very rare cases he or she can be de-canonized. Canonization takes place under different time and reason; for example in the same day when the [[Translation (relics)|translation of the relics]] is accompanied by a wonder, or only several centuries later.

Church historians name either five or seven periods of canonization in Russia; those who state there were five periods typically merge the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]-period with the Synodal-period and the post-[[October Revolution|revolutionary]] with the post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era. However, the seven period-system is used here for a better understanding of the Russian canonization history. Those are the following: 1) 9th century – 1547, 2) 1547 and 1549 ([[Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow|Macarius]] Councils), 3) 1550–1721 (pre-[[Peter I of Russia|Petrine]] period), 4) 1721–1894 (Synodal-period), 5) 1894–1917 (Nicholas II-period), 6) 1917–1987 (post-revolutionary period), 7) from 1988 (post-Soviet period).&lt;ref name="OTrubachov"/&gt;

==Early history of Christianity in the Rus' lands==
Christianity came to the [[Slavs]] already in the 1st century. According to early church historians, [[Apostle Andrew]] preached Christianity to Slavs and [[Scythians]], in the area between [[Eastern Europe]] in the west, and [[Caucasus]] and at the [[Black Sea]] coast in the south and east,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azbyka.ru/tserkov/istoriya/bulgakov_istoriya_russkoy_tserkvi_04-all.shtml|script-title=ru:История Русской Церкви – Глава 1.

Other active eparchies included the Gothian, Sourozhian, Fullian and the Bosporian.

==Hagiology==
[[File:Metropolitan Macarius.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow]]]]
The [[hagiology]] in the first period was particularly influenced by the Greek tradition. The Russian Church was one of several metropolitanates of the [[Constantinople Orthodox Church]] (i.e. the Greek Church), and almost all of the Metropolitans were of Greek origin (exceptions include [[Hilarion of Kiev|Hilarion]] and [[Kliment Smoliatich|Kliment]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azbyka.ru/tserkov/istoriya/bulgakov_istoriya_russkoy_tserkvi_14-all.shtml|script-title=ru:История Русской Церкви – Предисловие|trans-title=History of the Russian Church – Introduction|author=Macarius (Bulgakov)|language=Russian|publisher=Азбука веры (The Faith Alphabet)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following several [[Mongol Empire|Mongol-Tatar]] raids on Kiev in the mid-13th century, the [[cathedra]] was eventually moved to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1283&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azbyka.ru/library/rudakov_kratkaya_istoriya_tserkvi_46-all.shtml|title=Краткая история христианской церкви – 38. Правление митрополитов: святых Кирилла II, Петра и Алексия; перенесение митрополичьей кафедры из Киева во Владимир и потом в Москву|trans-title=Short History of the Christian Church – 38. The Rule of Metropolitans, St. Cyril II, Peter and Alexius; Move of Metropolitan Cathedras from Kiev to Vladimir and then to Moscow|author=Aleksandr Rudakov|language=Russian|publisher=Азбука веры (The Faith Alphabet)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to Moscow in 1325.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drevo-info.ru/articles/404.html|script-title=ru:Московская Епархия|trans-title=Moscow Eparchy|publisher=Open Orthodox Encyclopedia "Drevo-Info"|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Church became less depended by the Constantinople Orthodox Church over the years. After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 the wish for autonomity gradually increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azbyka.ru/tserkov/istoriya/bulgakov_istoriya_russkoy_tserkvi_55-all.shtml|title=История Русской Церкви – Глава I|trans-title=History of the Russian Church – Chapter I|author=Macarius (Bulgakov)|language=Russian|publisher=Азбука веры (The Faith Alphabet)}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, under [[Jonah of Moscow|Jonah]] the Russian Church factually became autocephalous. The formation of the [[Russian Tsardom]] under [[Ivan IV]] in 1547 and Metropolitan Macarius' [[Menologion]] made way for two so-called Macarius Councils in 1547 and 1549. The first one began on 1 February 1547 and includes both local and church-wide canonizations. Information about the following 1549 Council is less detailed – it is basically based on two sources; a mention of it by Ivan IV on the [[Stoglavy Council]] and the list of canonized people from the Lives of Saints of Metropolitan Jonah. Whether those were local or church-wide canonizations is not exactly known. Altogether 39 saints were canonized on those Councils. They were ideal models for the upcoming canonizations, and had a positive influence on the church and civic society.&lt;ref name="2Trubachov"/&gt;

The majority of saints were canonized in the period between 1550 and 1721, including around 123 local and 23 church-wide saints. Some were included in [[Synaxis|Synaxes]] (''собор''), groupings of saints of a region, such as Synaxis of All Saints of Novgorod or Synaxis of All Saints of Moscow. That period was marked by the happenings of the [[Raskol|Schism of the Russian Church]], caused by [[Patriarch Nikon]]'s reforms, which resulted to de-canonizations (and later re-canonizations) of some saints, such as of [[Anna of Kashin]] and [[Maxim Grek|Maxim the Greek]].&lt;ref name="3Trubachov"/&gt;

Following Peter I's western-influenced church reforms and [[centralization]] of the state in 1721 the Russian Church partially lost its independence from the state. The highest church organ was now the Most Holy Synod, a type of Council of Church Affairs, featuring non-clergical officials. In that period, from 1721 to 1894, the local canonization was completely removed as the tradition of honouring relics of local saints was seen as [[superstitious]] according to the Spiritual Regulation of 1721,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azbyka.ru/tserkov/svyatye/zhivov_agiografia_1g4_all.shtml#003|script-title=ru:Святость. Краткий словарь агиографических терминов — Алфавитный указатель|trans-title=Sainthood. Short Dictionary of Hagiographical Terms – Alphabetical Index|author=V.M. Zhivov|language=Russian|publisher=Азбука веры (The Faith Alphabet)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the church-wide canonizations greatly decreased. On the other hand, some of the most important saints were canonized in that period, such as the vast majority of [[Kiev-Pechersk Lavra|Kiev Caves]] monks or [[Michael I of Kiev (metropolitan)|Metropolitan Michael I]].&lt;ref name="4Trubachov"/&gt;

A separate period within the Synodal period were the last years of the [[Russian Empire]], ruled by Emperor Nicholas II (1894–1917). Nicholas II re-established the local canonization, and tried to recover the pre-Petrine format. For the first time since the last local canonization two centuries ago, the tradition has been reawaken in 1900, when 222 Orthodox believers led by [[Metrophanes, Chi Sung|St. Metrophanes]] were martyred during the anti-Christian [[Boxer Rebellion]] by the [[Yihetuan]]. A high point was the ceremonial canonization of [[Seraphim of Sarov]], where the Emperor personally carried the coffin and thousands of people came to that celebration from all of over Russia. Another factor in the rapid growth of canonizations was the progressed hagiological and [[hagiography|hagiographical]] researches between the 2nd half of the 19th century and the early 20th century in Russia.&lt;ref name="5Trubachov"/&gt; Furthermore, a future Council was expected to address questions regarding the gradual change to the traditional pre-Petrine system, but the date was always postponed until the revolutions. The church life flourished and reached records; for example, around 95,000 monks lived in Russia in 1914, while before that the number lied between 44,554 in 1894 and 25,207 in 1724.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azbyka.ru/tserkov/istoriya/istorija-russkoj-tserkvi-tsypin-all.shtml#n41|script-title=ru:История Русской Церкви (Синодальный период)|trans-title=History of the Russian Church (Synodal period)|publisher=Азбука веры (The Faith Alphabet)|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council from 1917 to 1918 also reviewed the practique of canonization, and can be viewed as a continuation of de-bureaucratization of the Synod. On the other side, the post-revolutionary years saw a radical [[secularization]] of the state. The new Soviet regime was even more hostile towards the Church and religion than the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. In the 1960s, when the Church strengthened inter-religious affairs, it canonized saints of other local churches, such as [[John the Russian]] and [[Herman of Alaska]]. Logically, the Russian Church overlept the myriad of martyrs died during severe Christian persecutions. Instead of local canonizations, the saints were often grouped into synaxes, to avoid conflicts with the atheist government. Between 1978 and 1979, the second and third volumes of the Reference Book of the Clergy allowed researching the pre-revolutionary hagiography.&lt;ref name="6Trubachov"/&gt;

A new era in church life started from 1988, during the Millennium of the [[Baptism of Russia|Baptism of the Rus']], when another Council was opened. In the following years canonizations that were previously unimaginable in the Communist regime were now performed, most notably of [[New Martyrs]]. Important canonizations include that of [[Dmitry Donskoy]] and [[Patriarch Tikhon]].&lt;ref name="7Trubachov"/&gt;

==Saint titles==
A traditionally practique in the Orthodox canonization is to add saint titles before the name of the saint. In the first Christian years, those were mainly martyrs. In the late 10th century, before the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]], canonization of hierarchs became possible, which made way to new saint titles, such as [[Enlightener]] and [[Equal-to-apostles]]. In the course of the years more titles were added, sometimes special titles were created after influential events (e.g. New Martyr).&lt;ref name="1Trubachov"/&gt;

The following list of saints include the saint title in italics. Saint titles including Wondermaker and [[Holy Unmercenaries]] are commonly not included next to the name of the saint as such qualities are obvious for the most saints. The following titles are listed here and in the [[List of Russian saints (from 16th century)|sister page]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azbyka.ru/days/p-tip-svjatosti|script-title=ru:Лик святости|trans-title=Saint Titles|publisher=Азбука веры (The Faith Alphabet)|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ru-icons.ru/part17/part172/saint.html|script-title=ru:Классификация святых|trans-title=Classification of Saints|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronological list==
The following list includes saints from the early years until the 15th century, most of which are Russians in the most different sense, while others are essential and important people in the Russian history. The period in which the saint was canonized is listed in the Number (#) column. The Portrait column typically illustrates the saint on icons or frescos, next to it are the name of the saint and his title, repeated just below in Russian. The following column describes in abbreviated form the saint's life and legacy. Name dates are listed both in [[Old Style and New Style dates|old and new style dates]], following a more precise date description. The Canonization column may list both local and church-wide canonizations; the question mark means the unknown date, but definite canonization, and a simple date without the type of canonization in brackets means the doubtful type of canonization.

[[File:Mirogoj Cemetery Arcade.jpg|thumb|237px|right|Mirogoj arcade]]

The '''Mirogoj Cemetery''' ({{IPA-sh|mîrɔɡɔːj|pron}}) is a [[cemetery]] park that is considered&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g294454-d316812-r146556614-Mirogoj_Cemetery-Zagreb.html&lt;/ref&gt; to be among the more noteworthy [[landmarks]] in the City of [[Zagreb]].  The cemetery inters members of all [[religions|religious groups]]: [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Islam|Muslim]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Protestant]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter Day Saints]]; [[irreligion|irreligious]] graves can all be found. In the arcades are the last resting places of many famous [[Croatians]].

==History==
The Mirogoj Cemetery was built on a plot of land owned by the linguist [[Ljudevit Gaj]], purchased by the city in 1872, after his death.{{sfn|Švigir|2010|p=10}}  Architect [[Hermann Bollé]] designed the main building. The new cemetery was inaugurated on 6 November 1876.{{sfn|Švigir|2010|p=12}}

The construction of the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s, the [[cupola]]s, and the church in the entryway was begun in 1879. Due to lack of funding, work was finished only in 1929.&lt;ref name="Polić"/&gt;

Unlike the older cemeteries, which were church-owned, Mirogoj was owned by the city, and accepted burials from all religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Polić"/&gt;

'''Peter Priesthood''' is the male version of the same term, though used somewhat less frequently.&lt;ref name=Shunn&gt;William Shunn, "[http://www.shunn.net/speak/m.html Mormonspeak]"&lt;/ref&gt; Many "Molly Mormons" are stereotyped as being consumed by their life within the church, and own testifying examples, will support the church.

These terms are occasionally used in an inner-circle way by members of the LDS church to refer to other Mormons who display or promote a righteous interpretation of their understanding of the church's teachings.  An example of a person that may be labeled this way is one who abstains from drinking caffeinated [[cola]] drinks (based on a scientific interpretation of a stimulant to the central nervous system [[Word of Wisdom]]), will not watch television on Sundays to preserve the Day of Rest. Abstinence from these behaviors is not required by the church to remain as a member in good standing, but is often preached unofficially as interpretations of church teachings in lessons taught by members of the church's local leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Lori G. Beaman, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3712231 Molly Mormons, Mormon Feminists and Moderates: Religious Diversity and the Latter Day Saints Church]" "Sociology of Religion", Vol. 62, No. 1 (Spring 2001), pp. 65–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--great ref--&gt;

==Usage in LDS culture==

The term "Molly Mormon" can take on both positive and negative connotations, depending on who is using it, and toward whom.  When used by or toward teens, it can refer to prudish behavior.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;  When it refers to an adult LDS woman, it often refers to a stereotype which may or may not be welcome.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Noyes Anderson, [http://deseretbook.com/mormon-life/news/story?story_id=704 "Molly Mormon No More: Becoming an Artist of Life"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041014005004/http://deseretbook.com/mormon-life/news/story?story_id=704 |date=2004-10-14 }} ''LDSLiving'' magazine, October 21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used openly in the LDS Church, and has even appeared in magazines published by the LDS church, as in the phrase "they had taunted her and called her a 'Molly Mormon' because she would not participate in their questionable activities",&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;LaRae Clarke, "[http://www.lds.org/ensign/1989/02/i-have-a-question I Have a Question]", ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', February 1989,  pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared in a 1989 edition of ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''.

The term is often simply abbreviated to "Molly" (or sometimes to "Momo") or used as an adjective: "She's gotten so molly lately—all she could say about these new shorts is that they were too short."&lt;ref name=Shunn /&gt;

==Commercialization==
A company calling itself ''Shameless Humor'' sells a line of clothing, including T-shirts and underwear, bearing the name "Molly Mormon".

A series of paperback romance novels written by [[LDS fiction]] author [[Tamra Norton]] has also appropriated the term into the series' title.  Books in the series include ''Molly Mormon?'', ''Molly Married?'', and ''Molly Mommy?'', and follow a Mormon girl named Molly through her teens on to married student life at [[BYU Idaho]] and then on to parenthood.

'''Our Lady of Confidence''', also known as '''La Madonna della Fiducia''' or '''Our Lady of Trust''', is a venerated image depicting the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] enshrined at the [[Lateran Basilica]]. The feast of Our Lady of Confidence falls on the last Saturday prior to Lent. 

[[Pope Gregory XVI]] granted a [[Canonical Coronation]] to the image on 14 October 1838, via Cardinal [[Carlo Odescalchi]], at the requested petition of the Roman seminarians. In addition, [[Pope Pius X]] was particularly devoted to Mary under this title.

==History==
There are two different traditions associated with the painting. One holds that it was painted by a religious sister in the eighteenth century. The other states that it was painted by [[Carlo Maratta]], who gave it to a young noblewoman who later became Abbess of the Convent of the [[Poor Clares]] in [[Todi, Italy]].&lt;ref name=dayton&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/o/our-lady-of-confidence.php "Who is the Madonna della Fiducia (or Confidence)?", Marian Library, University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devotion==
Devotion to the [[Virgin Mary|Blessed Virgin Mary]] under the title "Our Lady of Confidence" can be traced back to Sr. Chiara Isabella Fornari, who was a Poor Clare in [[Todi, Italy]]. The image is especially noteworthy in that [[Christ]] points to his mother, and Mary's intercession is typically invoked through the short prayer "Mater Mea, Fiducia Mea" (My Mother, My Confidence).

==Rome's Pontifical Major Seminary==
Originally, this Madonna was located at the Jesuit ''[[Roman College|Collegio Romano]]'', where it is believed she protected the seminarians from the Asiatic flu epidemic of 1837, which claimed many lives in Rome. To repay her, the seminarians crowned both Mother and Child with golden bejeweled diadems.&lt;ref name=dayton/&gt; A later story relates that, when over one hundred seminarians were conscripted during World War I and forced into the armed services of Italy, they placed themselves under her special care, and all returned home safely. 
The Patroness of [[Pontifical Major Roman Seminary|Rome's Major Seminary]] is the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title ''Madonna della Fiducia''. A miraculous copy of Our Lady of Confidence now resides at the Roman Major Seminary located in the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]] complex. [[Pope John Paul II]] started the papal tradition of venerating this miraculous image each year; subsequently, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] carried on the tradition. During his visit on the feast day of Our Lady of Confidence on 9 February 2002, [[Pope John Paul II]] ended his time at the seminary commenting on the devotion his predecessors had to Mary as ''Madonna della Fiducia'', saying, &lt;blockquote&gt;
We heard how Our Lady of Confidence guided the steps of [[Pope John XXIII]] on a path that brought him from this Seminary to the [[Second Vatican Council]], which was also a great seminary, the seminary of the bishops of the world. Let us thank Our Lady of Confidence for all that she did to assist Pope John XXIII in the preparation for and in the adventure of the Second Vatican Council. I wish all of you the grace to find her guidance in your lives:  from the image of Our Lady of Confidence to the goals that Providence foresees for you and even asks of you to be accomplished through you. Once again, thank you for this wonderful evening. Many thanks.&lt;ref&gt;Address given by Pope John Paul II 9 February 2002 http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2002/february/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20020209&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philae''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ai|l|i}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Φιλαί}}, {{lang-ar|فيله}} &amp;nbsp;{{IPA-arz|fiːlæ|lang}}, [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''p3-jw-rķ' or 'pA-jw-rq''; [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{Script/Coptic|ⲡⲓⲗⲁⲕ, ⲡⲓⲗⲁⲕⲭ}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holger|first=Kockelmann,|date=2012-04-24|title=Philae|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1456t8bn#page-2|journal=UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology|language=en|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[island]] in the reservoir of the [[Aswan Low Dam]], downstream of the [[Aswan Dam]] and [[Lake Nasser]], [[Egypt]]. Philae was originally located near the expansive [[Cataracts of the Nile|First Cataract]] of the [[Nile]] in [[Upper Egypt]] and was the site of an [[Egyptian temple]] complex. These [[rapids]] and the surrounding area have been variously flooded since the initial construction of the Aswan Low Dam in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;"''Milestones in Archaeology: a Chronological Encyclopedia''", Tim Murray, P464, ABC-CLIO, 2007ISBN 1-57607-186-3&lt;/ref&gt; The temple complex was dismantled and moved to nearby [[Agilkia Island]] as part of the [[UNESCO]] Nubia Campaign project, protecting this and other complexes before the 1970 completion of the Aswan High Dam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=24168&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites], UNESCO project site about Nubia Campaign.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Philae temple.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Panoramic view at the Philae Temple, at its current location on [[Agilkia Island]]]]

Philae is mentioned by numerous ancient writers, including [[Strabo]],&lt;ref&gt;i. p. 40, xvii. pp. 803, 818, 820&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]],&lt;ref&gt;i. 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]],&lt;ref&gt;iv. 5. § 74&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]],&lt;ref&gt;''Quaest. Nat.'' iv. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;v. 9. s. 10&lt;/ref&gt; It was, as the plural name indicates, the appellation of two small islands situated in latitude [[24th parallel north|24° north]], just above the First Cataract near [[Aswan]] (Egyptian ''Swenet'' "Trade;" {{lang-grc|Συήνη}}). Groskurd&lt;ref&gt;''Strab.'' vol. iii. p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; computes the distance between these islands and Aswan at about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}}.

Despite being the smaller island, Philae proper was, from the numerous and picturesque ruins formerly there, the more interesting of the two. Prior to the inundation, it was not more than {{convert|380|m}} long and about {{convert|120|m}} broad. It is composed of [[syenite]]: its sides are steep and on their summits a lofty wall was built encompassing the island.

Since Philae was said to be one of the burying-places of [[Osiris]], it was held in high reverence both by the Egyptians to the north and the [[Nubians]] (often referred to as "Ethiopians" in Greek) to the south. It was deemed profane for any but priests to dwell there and was accordingly sequestered and denominated "the Unapproachable" ({{lang-grc|ἄβατος}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plutarch|author-link=Plutarch|title=[[Moralia]]|editor-first=Gregorius N.|editor-last=Bernardakis|place=Leipzig|publisher=Teubner|year=1889|volume=2|chapter=De Iside et Osiride 359b|chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0238%3Astephpage%3D359b}} {{cite book|author=Diodorus|author-link=Diodorus Siculus|title=[[Bibliotheca Historica]]|volume=1-2|editor1-first=Immanuel|editor1-last=Bekker|editor1-link=August Immanuel Bekker|editor2-first=Ludwig|editor2-last=Dindorf|editor2-link=Karl Wilhelm Dindorf#Ludwig Dindorf|editor3-first=Friedrich|editor3-last=Vogel|publisher=In aedibus [[Bibliotheca Teubneriana|B.

Quaest. Nat. iv. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; These indeed were the traditions of a remote period; since in the time of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], Philae was so much resorted to, partly by pilgrims to the tomb of Osiris, partly by persons on secular errands, that the priests petitioned [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]] (170-117 BC) to prohibit public functionaries at least from coming there and living at their expense.

In the nineteenth century, [[William John Bankes]] took the [[Philae obelisk]] on which this petition was engraved to [[England]]. When its [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] were compared with those of the [[Rosetta Stone]], it threw great light upon the Egyptian consonantal alphabet.

The islands of Philae were not, however, merely sacerdotal abodes; they were the centres of commerce also between [[Meroë]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. For the rapids of the cataracts were at most seasons impracticable, and the commodities exchanged between Egypt and Nubia were reciprocally landed and re-embarked at Syene and Philae.

The neighbouring [[granite]] [[quarry|quarries]] also attracted a numerous population of miners and stonemasons; and, for the convenience of this traffic, a gallery or road was formed in the rocks along the east bank of the Nile, portions of which are still extant.

Philae also was remarkable for the singular effects of light and shade resulting from its position near the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. As the sun approached its northern limit the shadows from the projecting cornices and moldings of the temples sink lower and lower down the plain surfaces of the walls, until, the sun having reached its highest altitude, the vertical walls are overspread with dark shadows, forming a striking contrast with the fierce light which illuminates all surrounding objects.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, ''Erdkunde'', vol. i. p. 680, seq.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Construction===
The most conspicuous feature of both islands was their architectural wealth. Monuments of various eras, extending from the Pharaohs to the Caesars, occupy nearly their whole area. The principal structures, however, lay at the south end of the smaller island.

The most ancient was a temple for [[Isis]], built in the reign of [[Nectanebo I]] during 380-362 BC, which was approached from the river through a double [[colonnade]]. Nekhtnebef was his [[ancient Egyptian royal titulary]] and he became the founding pharaoh of the [[Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth]] and last native dynasty when he deposed and killed [[Nepherites II]].

For the most part, the other ruins date from the Ptolemaic Kingdom, more especially with the reigns of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]], and [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]] (282-145 BC), with many traces of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman]] work in Philae dedicated to [[Amun|Ammon]]-[[Osiris]].

In front of the propyla were two colossal [[lion]]s in granite, behind which stood a pair of [[obelisk]]s, each {{convert|13|m}} high. The propyla were pyramidal in form and colossal in dimensions. One stood between the [[wikt:dromos|dromos]] and [[Portico#Pronaos|pronaos]], another between the pronaos and the [[portico]], while a smaller one led into the sekos or [[adyton]]. At each corner of the adytum stood a monolithic shrine, the cage of a sacred hawk. Of these shrines one is now in the [[Louvre]], the other in the Museum at [[Florence]].

Beyond the entrance into the principal court are small temples, one of which, dedicated to Isis, Hathor, and a wide range of deities related to [[midwifery]], is covered with sculptures representing the birth of Ptolemy Philometor, under the figure of the god [[Horus]]. The story of [[Osiris]] is everywhere represented on the walls of this temple, and two of its inner chambers are particularly rich in symbolic imagery. Upon the two great propyla are Greek inscriptions intersected and partially destroyed by Egyptian figures cut across them.

The monuments in both islands indeed attested, beyond any others in the Nile valley, the survival of pure Egyptian art centuries after the last of the Pharaohs had ceased to reign. Great pains have been taken to mutilate the sculptures of this temple. The work of demolition is attributable, in the first instance, to the zeal of the [[early Christianity|early Christians]], and afterward, to the policy of the [[iconoclasm|Iconoclasts]], who curried favour for themselves with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine court]] by the destruction of {{linktext|heathen}} images as well as Christian ones.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It's notable that images/icons of Horus are often less mutilated than the other carvings. In some wall scenes, every figure and hieroglyphic text ''except'' that of Horus and his winged solar-disk representation have been meticulously scratched out by early Christians. This is presumably because the early Christians had some degree of respect for Horus or the legend of Horus - it may be because they saw parallels between the stories of Jesus and Horus (see [[Jesus in comparative mythology#Ancient Egypt]]).

The soil of Philae had been prepared carefully for the reception of its buildings&amp;ndash;being leveled where it was uneven, and supported by masonry where it was crumbling or insecure. For example, the western wall of the Great Temple, and the corresponding wall of the dromos, were supported by very strong foundations, built below the pre-inundation level of the water, and rested on the granite which in this region forms the bed of the Nile. Here and there steps were hewn out from the wall to facilitate the communication between the temple and the river.

At the southern extremity of the dromos of the Great Temple was a smaller temple, apparently dedicated to [[Hathor]]; at least the few columns that remained of it are surmounted with the head of that goddess. Its portico consisted of twelve columns, four in front and three deep. Their [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s represented various forms and combinations of the [[palm branch (symbol)|palm branch]], the [[Hyphaene thebaica|doum palm]] branch, and the [[Nymphaea caerulea|lotus flower]]. These, as well as the sculptures on the columns, the ceilings, and the walls were painted with the most vivid colors, which, owing to the dryness of the climate, have lost little of their original brilliance.

==History==

===Pharaonic era===
[[File:S10.08 Philae, image 9610.jpg|thumbnail|right|A sphinx in Philae]]
The ancient Egyptian name of the smaller island meant "boundary". As their southern frontier, the [[pharaoh]]s of Egypt kept there a strong garrison, and it was also a barracks for Greek and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldiers in their turn. The first temple structure, which was built by native pharaohs of the 30th dynasty, was the one for [[Hathor]].

===Greco-Roman era===
The island temple was built during the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. The principal deity of the temple complex was [[Isis]], but other temples and shrines were dedicated to other deities such as [[Hathor]]. [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]] believe that Philae was the last active site of the native [[ancient Egyptian religion]],&lt;ref name="Fletcher_2015_History_Weekend"&gt;{{cite AV media

The temple was closed down officially in AD 537 by the local commander Narses the Persarmenian in accordance with an order of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Procopius]] ''Bell. Pers.'' 1.19.37&lt;/ref&gt; It then became a church of [[Saint Stephen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Foertmeyer |first1=Victoria Ann |type=PhD|title=Tourism in Graeco-Roman Egypt |date=1989 |publisher=Princeton University |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruins of a church have been discovered and more than one adyton bore traces of having been made to serve at different eras the purposes of a chapel of [[Osiris]] and of [[Jesus]].

===1800s===
The island of Philae attracted much attention in the 19th century.  In the 1820s, [[Joseph Bonomi the Younger]], a British [[Egyptologist]] and [[museum]] [[curator]] visited the island.  So did [[Amelia Edwards]], a British [[novelist]] in 1873&amp;ndash;1874.
{{quote|The approach by water is quite the most beautiful. Seen from the level of a small boat, the island, with its palms, its colonnades, its pylons, seems to rise out of the river like a mirage. Piled rocks frame it on either side, and the purple mountains close up the distance. As the boat glides nearer between glistening boulders, those sculptured towers rise higher and even higher against the sky. They show no sign of ruin or age. All looks solid, stately, perfect. One forgets for the moment that anything is changed. If a sound of antique chanting were to be borne along the quiet air&amp;ndash;if a procession of white-robed priests bearing aloft the veiled ark of the God, were to come sweeping round between the palms and pylons&amp;ndash;we should not think it strange.|sign=Amelia B. Edwards|source=A thousand miles up the Nile / by Amelia B. Edwards, 1831-1892, p. 207.}}

These visits are only a small sample of the great interest that [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] Britain had for Egypt.  Soon, [[tourism]] to Philae became common.

===1900s===

====Aswan Low Dam====
[[File:Philae (1906) - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Philae flooded by the [[Aswan Low Dam]] in 1906.]]
[[File:Kioske of Phylae on the Flood.jpg|thumb|left|Kioske of Phylae on the Flood]]
In 1902, the [[Aswan Low Dam]] was completed on the Nile River by the [[United Kingdom|British]].  This threatened many ancient landmarks, including the temple complex of Philae, with being submerged.  The height of the dam was raised twice, from 1907–1912 and from 1929–1934, and the island of Philae was nearly always flooded.  In fact, the only times that the complex was not underwater was when the [[dam]]'s [[sluice]]s were open from July to October.

It was proposed that the temples be relocated, piece by piece, to nearby islands, such as [[Bigeh]] or [[Elephantine]].  However, the temples' [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]]s and other [[architecture|architectural]] supporting structures were strengthened instead.  Although the buildings were physically secure, the island's attractive [[vegetation]] and the colors of the temples' [[relief]]s were washed away.  Also, the bricks of the Philae temples soon became encrusted with [[silt]] and other debris carried by the Nile.

====Rescue project====
The temples had been practically intact since the ancient days, but with each inundation the situation worsened and in the 1960s the island was submerged up to a third of the buildings all year round.

In 1960 [[UNESCO]] started a project to try to save the buildings on the island from the destructive effect of the ever-increasing waters of the [[Nile]]. First, building three dams and creating a separate lake with lower water levels was considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000663/066319eb.pdf |title=Report on the safeguarding of the Philae monuments |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 1960 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=2014-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First of all, a large [[coffer dam]] was built, constructed of two rows of steel plates between which a {{convert|1|e6m3|lk=on|abbr=off}} of sand was tipped. Any water that seeped through was pumped away.

}}
Next the monuments were cleaned and measured, by using [[photogrammetry]], a method that enables the exact reconstruction of the original size of the building blocks that were used by the ancients. Then every building was dismantled into about 40,000 units, and then transported to the nearby [[Agilkia Island|Island of Agilkia]], situated on higher ground some {{convert|500|m|ft}} away.{{clear left}}

==Nearby locations of interest==
Prior to the inundation, a little west of Philae lay a larger island, anciently called Snem or Senmut, but now [[Bigeh]]. It is very steep, and from its most elevated peak affords a fine view of the Nile, from its smooth surface south of the islands to its plunge over the shelves of rock that form the First Cataract. Philae, Bigeh and another lesser island divided the river into four principal streams, and north of them it took a rapid turn to the west and then to the north, where the cataract begins.

Bigeh, like Philae, was a holy island; its ruins and rocks are inscribed with the names and titles of [[Amenhotep&amp;nbsp;III]], [[Ramesses II]], [[Psamtik&amp;nbsp;II]], [[Apries]], and [[Amasis&amp;nbsp;II]], together with memorials of the later [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rulers of Egypt. Its principal ruins consisted of the [[propylon]] and two columns of a temple, which was apparently of small dimensions, but of elegant proportions. Near them were the fragments of two colossal [[granite]] statues and also an excellent piece of masonry of much later date, having the aspect of an arch belonging to a church or [[mosque]].

[[File:Lupinus pilosus (Zachi Evenor for Wiki).jpg|thumb|right|Blue Lupines at Tel Socho]]
'''Sokho''', alternate spellings: '''Sokhoh''', '''Sochoh''', '''Soco''', '''Sokoh''', Hebrew: שוכה ,שוכו ,שכה, is the name given to two ancient towns in the territorial domain of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], the remains of both having been identified.  

Both towns were given the name ''Shuweikah'' in Arabic, a diminutive of the Arabic ''shawk'', "thorn." One is located to the south of [[Hebron]] and has been identified with the twin ruins known as ''Khirbet Shuwaikah Fauka'' and ''Tahta'' (Upper and Lower Shuwaikah), 6 km southwest of [[As-Samu|Eshtamoa]] in the Hebron Hills district ({{Bibleref2|Joshua 15:48}}). The other ruin is the more popular of the two, situated on a hilltop overlooking the [[Valley of Elah|Elah Valley]] between [[Adullam]] and [[Azekah]] ({{Bibleref2|Joshua 15:35}}), in the lower stratum of the [[Judean Hills|Judaean hills]]. The site, occupied as early as the Iron Age, was visited by [[Claude Conder]] in 1881, who writes that it was already a ruin in his days, with two wells in the valley towards the west.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 410 in: {{cite book|last1=Conder|first1=C.R.|authorlink1=Claude Reignier Conder|last2=Kitchener|first2=H.H.|authorlink2=Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|year=1883|url=https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/410/mode/2up|title=The Survey of Western Palestine: Memoirs of the Topography, Orography, Hydrography, and Archaeology|location=London|publisher=[[Palestine Exploration Fund|Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund]]|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third town by this name, [[ Shuwaykah]], was located in the Hefer region ({{Bibleref2|1 Kings 4:10}}), north of [[Tulkarm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Klein (scholar)|S. Klein]], ''Qovetz'': Journal of the Jewish Palestinian Exploration Society, 2nd year, volumes 1–4, article: ''On the Kings of Canaan'' (Heb. לפרשת מלכי כנען), Jerusalem 1934–1935, p. 41 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
Although listed in Joshua 15:35 as being a city in the plain, it is actually partly in the hill country, partly in the plain. The [[Philistines]] encamped between Sokho and Azekah in the [[Valley of Elah|Elah Valley]] before [[Goliath]]'s historic encounter with [[David]], the son of Jesse ({{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 17:1}}). David slew the Philistine giant with a stone slung from a shepherd's sling. [[Rehoboam]] fortified the place ({{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 11:7}}), but it is not clear which of the two sites is referred to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution= |title= The Anchor Bible Dictionary|editor-last1=Freedman |editor-first1=David Noel |editor-last2= |editor-first2=  |editor-link= David Noel Freedman|volume= 6 |publisher= |place =New York|page=s.v. Socho |year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socho was one of the cities occupied temporarily by the Philistines in the time of [[Ahaz]] ({{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 28:18}}).

The word "Sokho" appears on certain [[LMLK seal]]s during the [[Kingdom of Judah|Judean monarchy]], believed by many scholars to be one of four cities that acted in some administrative capacity.

The [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] [[Rabbi]] [[Antigonus of Sokho]], mentioned in ''Ethics of the Fathers'' ([[Pirkei Avot]] 1:3), likely came from the Hebron-region town. Rabbi Levi Sukia, of the first generation of [[Amoraim]], also came from Sokho (Jerusalem Talmud, Eruvim).

In [[Byzantine]] times, [[Eusebius]] described  Sokho (Σοκχωθ) as a double village at the ninth milestone between [[Eleutheropolis]] (Bet Guvrin) and Jerusalem (Eusebius, Onom. 156:18 ff.), which would correspond to the Elah Valley location. The 6th-century [[Madaba Map]] also depicts Sokho (Σωκω).

==Givat HaTurmusim==
{{main|Socoh (Shephelah)}}
[[File:Cave-like cistern at Tel-Socho (Khirbet Shuweikah) - 2 Feb. 2015.JPG|thumb|Ancient cistern at Tel Socho]]

The hill of Tel Sokho is now known as "''Givat HaTurmosim''," or "Hill of the [[Lupinus pilosus|Lupines]]."  In late March, the entire hill is covered with wild blue Mountain lupines (''[[Lupinus pilosus]]'') and becomes a popular outing destination for Israeli families. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000096482.htm The Valley of Elah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208155727/http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000096482.htm |date=2006-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The hill is surrounded by precipitous slopes on its north side, making it almost impassable. Trails ascend the mountain on its northwestern side and southeastern sides. The [[Valley of Elah|Elah Valley]] runs in a westerly-easterly direction on its north side, the hilltop affording a good view of the valley below. 
On the elevated plateau, one can see the foundations of ancient dwellings carved into the bedrock with individual chambers divided by broken stone protuberances. Caves and grottos dot the landscape, and cisterns are carved deep into the rock. Oak trees, fig trees and terebinths grow on the mountainside and piles of large ashlar boulders, covered with lichen, attest to the presence of a defensive wall around the city in antiquity. According to the biblical narrative, when [[Joshua]] captured the city from the Canaanites, the city and environs became the inheritance of Judah.
==Archaeology==
Excavations at the foot of the northern slope exposed a Byzantine building from the fifth–sixth centuries. Remains from Iron Age II were uncovered in another dig at the foot of the northern slope, and walls dating to the Middle Bronze Age were discovered in probe trenches. Potsherds dating to the Late Bronze Age and later periods were gathered, along with a terracotta figurine of reddish brown clay depicting a naked woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=1728 Israel Antiquities Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of a preëxilic stamp with the imprint ''[[LMLK seal|La-melekh]]'' ('''למלך''') and where Sokho is named with another three cities has led archaeologists to conclude that Sokho may have served as an administrative or storage center. One of the wells to the west in the valley, mentioned by Claude Conder, was destroyed with explosives by Arab infiltrators (''mistanenim'') in 1956, never being rebuilt.  An intensive survey conducted in 2010 included an examination of Middle Bronze and Iron Age burial caves, as well as slag from a pottery workshop (which probably dates to the Crusader/Mamluk period).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Hasel, Michael G. |author2=Garfinkel, Yosef | author3=Weiss, Shifra |title=Socoh of the Judean Shephelah: The 2010 Survey | publisher=Eisenbrauns Inc. | location=Winona Lake, Indiana | date=2017 | isbn=9781575067667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3775">The '''"Star Prophecy"''' (or '''Star and Scepter prophecy''') is a [[Messiah|Messianic]] reading applied by Jewish [[Zealot]]s and [[early Christians]] to {{bibleref2|Numbers| 24:17|KJV}}:

==Bible narrative==
{{quote|I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.|Numbers 24:17}}

==Messianism==
The prophecy was often employed during the troubled years that led up to the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish Revolt]], the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] (70 CE) and the suicidal last stand of the [[Sicarii]] at [[Masada]] in 73 CE.  The Star Prophecy appears in the [[Qumran]] texts called the [[Dead Sea scrolls]]. "This was the prophecy that was of such importance to all resistance groups in this period, including those responsible for the documents at Qumran and the revolutionaries who triggered the war against Rome, not to mention the early Christians"&lt;ref name = "Eisenman 1997 p23"&gt;(Eisenman 1997 p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Star Prophecy was applied to the coming Messiah himself in contemporary radical Jewish documents, such as the [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] ''[[War Scroll]]'' found at Qumran. In a ''[[pesher]]'' applied to the text from ''Numbers'', the War Scroll's writer gives the following [[exegesis]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;…by the hand of the Poor whom you have redeemed by Your Power and the peace of Your Mighty Wonders… by the hand of the Poor and those bent in the dust, You will deliver the enemies of all the lands and humble the mighty of the peoples to bring upon their heads the reward of the Wicked and justify the Judgement of Your Truth on all the [[Son of Man|sons of men]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some have speculated that the Romanized Jewish historian [[Josephus]], applied the prophecy to [[Vespasian]], who was campaigning against the Jewish [[Zealot]]s in Palestine, and "who was to come out of Palestine and rule the world." According to Robert Karl Gnuse, it is not certain that Josephus was referring to the Star Prophecy:
{{quote|"In his history Josephus observes that Vespasian was destined to be the world ruler who would come out of Judea, and not a Jewish messiah, as the revolutionaries had erroneously anticipated (War 6.312-314). … Josephus may have drawn upon the texts in Daniel 9:25-26 primarily and Genesis 49:10, Numbers 24:17, and Daniel 7:13-14 secondarily. He may have used an Essenic understanding of a messianic world ruler in addition."&lt;ref&gt; Robert Karl Gnuse. Dreams and Dream Reports in the Writings of Josephus: A Traditio-historical Analysis. (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1996), p. 140. &lt;/ref&gt;}}

The star has been externalized as an actual star in the sky, the [[Star of Bethlehem]], in the narration of the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. The fulfilled Star Prophecy is one of numerous instances of the asserted fulfillment of prophecies that are a main theme of this text.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

==Simon bar Kokhba==
The prophecy was also applied to [[Simon bar Kokhba]], messianic leader of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Second Jewish Revolt]] of 132, whose adopted name ''bar Kokhba'' means "Son of a Star" in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].

The '''Swedenborg Rite''' or '''Rite of Swedenborg''' was a fraternal order modeled on [[Freemasonry]] and based upon the teachings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]].  It comprised six [[Degree (freemasonry)|Degree]]s: Apprentice, Fellow Craft, Master Neophyte, Illuminated Theosophite, Blue Brother, and Red Brother.&lt;ref name=EoF2&gt;Albert Gallatin Mackey and H. L. Haywood, ''Encyclopedia of Freemasonry Vol. 2'', p. 997 reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, 2003 {{ISBN|0-7661-4720-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was initially a political organization, whose aims might bring freemasonry into disrepute, although the political ideology was eventually discarded from the rite.&lt;ref name=Row&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|encyclopedia=Masonic Biography and Dictionary|author=Augustus Row|publisher=J.P.

Starting in the 1870s, the Rite was resurrected as an [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] organization. This version faded out sometime around 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaos Out of Order: The Rise and Fall of the Swedenborgian Rite|author=R. A.

In 1982 a patent of the Swedenborg Rite was transmitted by the English Freemason Desmond Bourke, in his office at the British Museum, to Masonic author [[Michele Moramarco]], who after revising the rituals by Bourke's permission revived that tradition in Italy under the title of "Antico Rito Noachita" ("Ancient Noachide Rite")

'''Bhai Tara Singh Wan''' was an eighteenth-century [[Sikh]] martyr. He was from the village of [[Wan, Punjab|Wan]], also known as ''Wan Tara Singh'' and ''Dall-Wan'' now in [[Amritsar district]] of the [[Punjab, India|Eastern Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/sikh-martyrs/sikh-martyrs-bhai-tara-singh-ji|title=Sikh Martyrs:Bhai Tara Singh Ji - Gateway to Sikhism|author=|date=|work=|publisher=www.allaboutsikhs.com|accessdate=13 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030211854/http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/sikh-martyrs/sikh-martyrs-bhai-tara-singh-ji|archivedate=30 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family background==
His father, ''S. Gurdas Singh'', had received the rites of the [[Khalsa]] in the time of [[Guru Gobind Singh|Guru Gobind Singh Sahib]], and had taken part in the [[Battle of Amritsar (1709)|Battle of Amritsar]] (6 April 1709), in which [[Bhai Mani Singh]] led the [[Sikh]]s and in which Har Sahai, a revenue official of [[Patti, Punjab|Patti]], was killed at his (Gurdas Singh's) hands. ''Baba Gurdas Singh'' took martyrdom in Bajwara ([[Hoshiarpur]]) when he went along with ''[[Banda Singh Bahadur|Baba Banda Singh]]'' to fight for [[Sirhind]]. Baba Gurdas Singh was married in next village of [[Rajoke, Punjab|Rajoke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Prachin Panth Prakash|last=Bhangu|first=Ratan Singh|authorlink= |coauthors=|year=1841|publisher=Vazir Hind Publications |location=Amritsar|isbn=|page= |pages=|url=|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
''Bhai Tara Singh'', the eldest of the five sons of ''Gurdas Singh'', was born around 1687. He took [[Amrit Sanskar|Amrit]] from [[Bhai Mani Singh]]. Receiving the rites of initiation, he grew up to be a devout [[Sikh]], skilled in the [[Gatka|martial arts]].

==Martyrdom==
As persistent persecution drove the Sikhs out of their homes to seek shelter in hills and forests, Tara Singh collected around him a band of desperadoes and lived defiantly at [[Wan, Punjab|Wan]], where he, according to Ratan Singh Bhangu's [[Pracheen Panth Prakash]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhnet.com/discussion/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=328|title=Prachin Panth Prakash by Ratan Singh Bhangu|author=|date=|work=|publisher=www.sikhnet.com|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nihangsingh.org/blog/?p=835|title=The expansion of the Panth - Sri Gur Panth Prakash|author=|date=|work=|publisher=www.nihangsingh.org|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsks.co.in/bvs_pracheen_panth_parkash.htm|title=Buy Pracheen Panth Prakash by Ratan Singh Bhangu|author=|date=|work=|publisher=www.jsks.co.in|accessdate=13 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326164046/http://www.jsks.co.in/bvs_pracheen_panth_parkash.htm|archivedate=26 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sikhinstitute.org/gpp_v1.pdf|title=Panth Prakash in English - PDF Download|author=|date=|work=|publisher=www.sikhinstitute.org|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; possessed ajag'Iror landgrant.

''Ja'far Begh'' reported the matter to [[Zakariya Khan]], who sent a [[punitive expedition]] consisting of 2,000 horse, 5 elephants, 40 light guns and 4 cannononwheels under his deputy, [[Momin Khan]]. Tara Singh had barely 22 men with him at that time. They kept the Lahore force at bay through the night but were killed to a man in the handtohand fight on the following day 1726.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/main.html|title=The Great Sikh Warriors|author=|date=|work=|publisher=www.sikh-history.com|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their heads were taken back to [[Lahore]] and thrown in blind well where ''Gurudwara Shaheed Singhania'' now stands in [[Landa Bazar]]. A [[Gurdwara|Gurudwara Sahib]] now marks the site where the dead bodies of ''Bhai Tara Singh'' and his 20 companions were cremated.

==History==
The origins of the Twelve Tribes movement can be traced to a ministry for teenagers called the "Light Brigade"&lt;ref name='Glance'&gt;{{cite news | first=Gary | last=Warth |authorlink= | title=The 12 Tribes at a glance | date=2009-10-03 | publisher=Lee Enterprise | url =http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/valley-center/article_a68bc3cf-981d-5250-9525-e064a002bf1d.html | work =North County Times | accessdate = 2009-11-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1972.&lt;ref name="Livingasone"/&gt; The ministry operated out of a small [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]] called "The Lighthouse"&lt;ref name="palmerraising"/&gt; in the home of Gene Spriggs and his wife Marsha. The Light Brigade began living communally&lt;ref name='Hunt'&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Stephen | authorlink = Stephen J. Hunt | title = Christian Millennialism | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 2001 | location = Bloomington and Indianapolis, Indiana | pages = 209–223 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-253-21491-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened a restaurant called "The Yellow Deli" while attending several churches, before deciding on the [[First Presbyterian Church (Chattanooga, Tennessee)|First Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref name="hosts"/&gt; The Light Brigade, while at First Presbyterian, caused friction with the establishment by bringing in anyone who was willing to come with them, including members of different [[social classes]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial groups]], a practice not engaged in at that time.&lt;ref name="palmerraising"/&gt; On January 12, 1975, the group arrived at First Presbyterian only to find out that the service had been cancelled for the [[Super Bowl]],&lt;ref name="palmerraising"/&gt; this led the group to form The Vine Christian Community Church.&lt;ref name="Hunt"/&gt; During this time, the church "planted" churches, each with its own Yellow Deli, in [[Dalton, Georgia|Dalton]] and [[Trenton, Georgia]]; [[Mentone, Alabama]]; and [[Dayton, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="Vine Church"/&gt;

[[File:Island Pond raid.jpg|thumb|180px|Northeast Kingdom Community Church members leaving the courthouse with their children on June 22, 1984]]
Their withdrawal from the religious mainstream turned what had been a friction-filled relationship into an outcry against them.&lt;ref name="Palmer1998"/&gt; They began holding their own services, which they called "Critical Mass" in [[Warner Park (Chattanooga)|Warner Park]],&lt;ref name='Palmer2010'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Twelve Tribes: Preparing a Bride for Yahshua's Return |journal=Nova Religio|date=February 2010|first=Susan J.|last=Palmer|volume=13|issue=3|pages=59–80|doi= 10.1525/nr.2010.13.3.59|url=|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointing elders&lt;ref name='elder1'&gt;{{cite news | first=Alan | last=Murray |authorlink= | title=Vine elders concede church has authoritarian character | date=1978-01-19 | publisher=Chattanooga Publishing Company, Inc. | url = | work =Chattanooga Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Bankrupt'&gt;{{cite news | first=Bill | last=Castel |authorlink= | title=Elder: "We have no money" | date=1980-12-01 | publisher=Chattanooga Publishing Company, Inc. | url = | work =Chattanooga Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and baptizing people outside any denominational authority. The deteriorating relationship between the group and the religious and secular Chattanooga community attracted the attention of [[FREECOG|The Parents' Committee to Free Our Children from the Children of God]] and the [[Citizen's Freedom Foundation]] who labeled the church a "[[cult]]" and heavily attacked Spriggs as a cult leader.&lt;ref name="Palmer1998"/&gt; This led to what the group refers to today as the "Cult Scare"&lt;ref name='Scare'&gt;{{cite news | first=Eddie | last=Wiseman |authorlink= | title=Cult Scare in Chattanooga | date=Spring–Summer 2009 | publisher=Parchment Press | url =http://www.twelvetribes.com/pdf/freepapers/vine-house-days.pdf | work =In the Vine House Days |page=10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130185621/http://twelvetribes.com/pdf/freepapers/vine-house-days.pdf |archive-date=2010-11-30 | accessdate = 2009-11-06  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late seventies.

[[File:Common Sense Island Pond.jpg|left|thumbnail|Common Sense Cafe and Yellow Deli in Island Pond, Vermont; owned and operated by Twelve Tribes.]]
The move to Vermont, combined with an initial period of economic hardship, caused some members to leave.&lt;ref name="palmerraising"/&gt; The Citizen's Freedom Foundation conducted several meetings in [[Barton, Vermont|Barton]] to draw attention to the group.&lt;ref name="amc"/&gt; The Citizen's Freedom Foundation had made allegations of mind control in Chattanooga, but now it made accusations of [[child abuse]].&lt;ref name="amc"/&gt; In 1983, charges were brought against Charles "Eddie" Wiseman (an elder in the group) for [[misdemeanor]] [[assault|simple assault]]; this, combined with multiple child custody cases, formed the basis for a search warrant.

[[File:Peacemaker1.jpg|thumbnail|right|Peacemaker 1 bus at a June 22, 1984 Raid anniversary in Island Pond, Vermont.]]
By 1989, the church had become widely accepted in Island Pond&lt;ref name='underfire'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=| title=Vt.

During this expansion phase, the group used the name Messianic Communities, before deciding to rename itself The Twelve Tribes. Through the mid-2000s (decade), the group remained controversial, with accusations of [[child labor]],&lt;ref name="labor"&gt;{{cite news | first=Kenneth | last=Lovett |authorlink= | title=Upstate 'Soap' Cult fined for Child Labor | date=2001-10-04 | publisher=[[News Corporation]] | url =http://www.nypost.com/p/news/upstate_soap_cult_fined_for_child_Eoi0z2cBQc5W4LlE1al4FK | work =New York Post | accessdate = 2009-12-15  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Child abduction#Parental child abduction|custodial interference]],&lt;ref name="amc"/&gt; and illegal [[homeschooling]].&lt;ref name='homeschoolgerman'&gt;{{cite news | title=Fundamentalist Christian Group Gets School of Their Own | date=2006-08-31 | url =http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2151809,00.html | work =Deutsche Welle | accessdate = 2009-11-17  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the group held a reunion for members and friends of the Vine Christian Community Church and the former Yellow Deli in Warner Park, announcing a new community in Chattanooga.&lt;ref name='Return2'&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert T. | last=Nash |authorlink= | title=Chattanooga Yellow Deli Reunion Draws Crowd | date=2006-04-16 | publisher=Chattanooga Publishing Company, Inc. | url =http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_83886.asp | work =Chattanoogan | accessdate = 2009-11-17  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement proceeded to open a new Yellow Deli in 2008, nearly 30 years after leaving Chattanooga.&lt;ref name="hosts"/&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
The Twelve Tribes' beliefs resemble those of [[Christian fundamentalism]], the [[Hebrew Roots]] movement, [[Messianic Judaism]] and the [[Sacred Name Movement]]; however the group believes that all other [[Christian denominations|denominations]] are fallen, and it therefore  refuses to align itself with any denomination or movement.&lt;ref name="palmerraising"/&gt;  They believe that in order for the messiah to return, the Church needs to be restored to its original form seen in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A38-42&amp;version=CJB Acts 2:38–42] and [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4%3A32-37&amp;version=CJB Acts 4:32–37]. This restoration is not merely the restoration of the 1st-century church, but the creation of a new Israel consisting of Twelve Tribes in twelve geographic regions.&lt;ref name="palmerraising"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glance"/&gt;  Part of this restoration is the return to observing the [[Shabbat|sabbath]], maintaining some of the [[613 Mitzvot|Mosaic law]]&lt;ref name='a church of their own'&gt;{{cite news | first=Heather | last=Stephenson |authorlink= | title=A church of their own | date=2000-09-10 | publisher=Herald Association | url= | work =Rutland Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; including dietary laws, and the festivals.&lt;ref name="a church of their own"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Gary | last=Warth |authorlink= | title=VALLEY CENTER: Twelve Tribes Christian community lives as an example of its faith | date=2009-10-04 | publisher=Lee Enterprise | url =http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2009/oct/04/valley-center-twelve-tribes-christian-community/ | work =North County Times | accessdate = 2009-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of the prophesied restoration of Israel,&lt;ref name="Livingasone"/&gt; combined with the perceived immorality&lt;ref name='psalms'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=Twelve Tribes | authorlink= | title=If the Foundations Are Destroyed, What Can the Righteous Do? | date=Fall 2004 | publisher=Parchment Press | url=http://www.twelvetribes.com/pdf/freepapers/love-is-splendored.pdf | work=Love is a Many Splendored thing | pages=9–12 | accessdate=2009-12-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130193309/http://twelvetribes.com/pdf/freepapers/love-is-splendored.pdf | archivedate=2010-11-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the world leads the group to believe that the end times has arrived, though no date has been set.&lt;ref name='farm'&gt;{{cite news | first=Kim | last=Folstad |authorlink= | title=Life on the Farm | date=2000-12-02 | publisher=Cox Enterprises | work =Palm Beach Post | pages =9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One noted aspect of the group is its insistence on using the name "[[Yahshua]]",&lt;ref name="Palmer1998"/&gt; as opposed to [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name="palmerraising"/&gt; Because the name "Yahshua" represents the nature of Jesus, the group similarly bestows upon each member a Hebrew name that is meant to reflect the personality of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Matt | last=Stearns |authorlink= | title=Disciples maintain a life of simplicity – Despite controversy, – group lives quietly | date=2002-01-06 | publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]] | url =| work =[[The Kansas City Star]] | pages =B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group operates as a 501 (d) – "for-profit organization with a religious purpose and a common treasury."  The community pays property taxes, but the 501d structure tends to result in no income tax liability.&lt;ref name="Livingasone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hosts"/&gt;

The Twelve Tribes has been cited by [[Stuart A.

===Teachings about Jews ===
It teaches that the [[Jews]] were [[Jewish deicide|guilty of the blood of Christ]], quoting [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+27%3A25&amp;version=CJB Matthew 27:25].&lt;ref name=Guardian2000-7-3&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jul/03/race.religion | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jeevan | last=Vasagar | title=Racist sect digs in at rock festivals | date=2000-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ttjews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twelvetribes.org/articles/who-does-pope-think-he|title=Who Does the Pope Think He Is?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often labelled [[antisemitic]], the group repeatedly denies this accusation. Its members keep the [[Sabbath]] and the Jewish festivals of [[Pesach]], [[Yom Kippur]], and [[Sukkot]]. Youth have [[Bar Mitzvah]] and Bat Mitzvah celebrations, and they regularly perform Israeli folk dances.&lt;ref name=benningtonbanner11-3-07 &gt;{{cite news | location = Bennington, VT | work=Bennington Banner | first=Neal | last=Goswami |title=Let Us Pray: Twelve Tribes, honoring the past}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]] asserted that apprenticeships amounted to [[indentured servitude]] and were illegal. [[Robert Redford]]'s [[Sundance Group#Sundance Catalog|Sundance Catalog]], who had contracted with Common Wealth Woodworks (another of the group's cottage industries that made furniture), also terminated their contract as a response to the allegations.&lt;ref name="noapology"/&gt; The Labor Department found no violations at Common Sense Farm or Commonwealth Woodworks. They did fine two other industries $2,000 for a 15-year-old pushing a [[wheelbarrow]] and another 15-year-old changing a [[lightbulb]].&lt;ref name="fifteen"/&gt;

In Germany and France, the controversies centered on the issues of homeschooling, health, child abuse, and religious freedom.

==Police raids in Germany==

On September 5, 2013, German police raided two communities belonging to the Twelve Tribes 
and removed 40 children to protect them from alleged continued abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23977577 | work=BBC News | title=German Christian sect raided and children put in care | date=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group admits that they use a "reed-like rod" for discipline, but denies abusing their children.

'''Umay''' (also known as '''Umai'''; in [[Old Turkic]]: [[File:Old Turkic letter Y1.svg|10px]][[File:Old Turkic letter M.svg|10px]][[File:Old Turkic letter O.svg|10px]]; {{lang-kk|Ұмай ана}}, ''Umay ana''; {{lang-ru|Ума́й / Ымай}}, ''Umáj / Ymaj'') is the goddess of fertility&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Cotterell |first=Arthur |author2=Rachel Storm  |title=The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Mythology |year=1999 |publisher=Lorenz Books |location=New York |isbn=0-7548-0091-1 |pages=466, 481}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Turkic mythology]] and [[Tengriism]] and as such related to women, mothers and children. Umay resembles earth-[[mother goddess]]es found in various other world religions.

==Etymology==
In [[Mongolic languages|Mongolian]], ''Umai'' means 'womb' or 'uterus'. The [[earth]] was considered a "mother" symbolically. The [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] root ''umāy'' originally meant 'placenta, afterbirth', and this word was used as the name for the goddess whose function was to look after women and children, possibly because the placenta was thought to have magic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clauson|first=Gerard|title=An Etymological Dictionary of Pre-Thirteenth Century Turkish|year=1972|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=164–165|authorlink=Gerard Clauson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literally in the [[Mongolian language]], "eje" or "eej" means "mother," and in Old Turkic, the word ''eçe'' also means 'mother'.{{Clarify|date=December 2017|reason=Which Mongolian? Is there, for "umay" or "eje", really any verifiable connection to Turkic, or vice versa, regarding the language groups may not be closely related, and if, which connection? Words might be similar by coincidence more often than a layperson may think.}}

== Goddess of Children ==
The name appeared in the 8th-century [[Orkhon inscriptions|inscription]] of [[Kul Tigin]] in the phrase ''Umay teg ögüm katun kutıŋa'' 'under the auspices of my mother who is like the goddess Umay'.

Umay is a protector of women and children. The oldest evidence is seen in the [[Orkhon script]] monuments. From these it is understood that Umay was accepted as a mother and a guide. Also, [[khagan]]s were thought to represent [[Tengri|Kök Tengri]]. Khagan wives, ''katun''s or ''hatun''s, were considered Umays, too. With the help of 'Umay, ''katun''s had babies, and these babies were the guarantee of the empire. According to ''Divanü Lügat’it-Türk'', when women worship Umay, they have male babies. [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] women tie strings attached with small cradles to will a baby from Umay. This belief can be seen with the [[Tungusic peoples]] in Southern [[Siberia]] and the [[Altay people]]. Umay is always depicted together with a child. There are only rare exceptions to this. It is believed that when Umay leaves a child for a long time, the child gets ill and [[shamanism|shamans]] are involved to call Umay back. The smiling of a sleeping baby shows Umay is near it and crying means that Umay has left.

In the view of the [[Kyrgyz people]], Umay not only protects children, but also [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] communities around the world. At the same time Umay helps people to obtain more food and goods and gives them luck.

As Umay is associated with the sun, she is called ''Sarı Kız'' 'Yellow Maiden', and yellow is her colour and symbol. She is depicted as having sixty golden tresses that look like the rays of the sun. She is thought to have once been identical with [[Ot Ene]] of the [[Mongol]]s and [[Altay people|Altay]]. ''Umay'' and ''[[Ece]]'' are also used as female given names in the Republic of [[Turkey]].

The temple is situated on a hill, approximately {{convert|300|m|ft}} from the main [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] in the area, the '''Naba al-Arbain'''.

He stored the statue at a museum he founded in the ruins of [[Baalbek]]. Alouf also found a [[Roman road]] measuring {{convert|200|m|mi}}, located {{convert|2|km|mi}} southeast of the lake. He also found another square building measuring approximately {{convert|12|m2|ft2}} next to this road. The building was constructed of large stones and an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] inscription was found inside. He considered it an ancient [[guardhouse]] or [[watchtower]] for protection of travellers. He suggested that [[oracle]]s were consulted at the temple in connection with [[Queen Zenobia]], who legend tells, sent offerings to the [[goddess]] by placing them on the lake. If the offerings sunk to the floor of the lake, then the goddess had accepted them. If the offerings floated, then they had been rejected and gave a bad [[omen]] to [[Palmyra]] and the surrounding lands.&lt;ref name="AloufRain1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michel M.

The village lies on the Yammoune Fault line, a geological [[Fault (geology)|fault]] responsible for several historical [[earthquake]]s in the area. A new section of the fault was discovered in 2010 by Ata Elias of the [[American University of Beirut]]. They studied samples from a trench in [[Marjahine]] that will allow them to improve dating on historical earthquakes and better predict future ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/Nov/03/Study-uncovers-new-segment-of-Yammouneh-fault-line.ashx#axzz2Ak8tJbZ6 Study uncovers new segment of Yammouneh fault line, The Daily Star (Lebanon), 3 November, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lake Yammoune==
Lake Yammoune is home to Lebanon's only endemic [[fish]], ''[[Pseudophoxinus libani]]''.&lt;ref name="SOER"&gt;[http://test.moe.gov.lb/Documents/SOER%20Chap%205%20reduced.pdf Jaradi, Ghassan Ramasdan., State &amp; Trends of the Lebanese Environment, Chapter 5, Biodiversity and Forests, United Nations Development Programme for the Lebanese Ministry of the Environment, p. 157, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Phoenician Mythology]], the goddess [[Astarte]] turned herself into a [[gold]]en fish in Yammoune lake to escape from the vengeance of [[Adonis]]'s wrathful brother [[Typhon]].&lt;ref name="Boulanger1955"/&gt;

The lake is filled from a water cavern to the west of the temple has only one outflow, through a big hole and [[Robert Boulanger]] suggested that it might dry up entirely at the end of summer.&lt;ref name="Boulanger1955"/&gt; The valley of [[Ouyoun Ergush]] leads from Yammoune towards [[Marjhine]].&lt;ref name="Gale2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gale|title=Who's Who in Lebanon 2003–2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S2dmAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 October 2012|date=October 2002|publisher=Gale Group|isbn=978-2-903188-20-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A network of rock-cut irrigation channels and watercourses lead from Lake Yammoune to provide irrigation for the region of the [[Beqaa Valley]] around Baalbek.&lt;ref name="SimmonsWhayne1944"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Stevens Simmons|author2=Tom French Whayne|author3=Gaylord West Anderson|author4=Harold Maclachlan Horack |author5=United States Surgeon-General's Office: Preventive Medicine Service|title=Global epidemiology: a geography of disease and sanitation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5y2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 October 2012|year=1944|publisher=J.B. Lippincott company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible early sanctuary of El==
Marvin H. Pope (Yale University) identified  the home of [[El (god)|El]] in the [[Ugarit|Ugaritic texts]] of ca. 1200 BCE, described as "at the source[s] of the [two] rivers, in the midst of the fountains of the [two] deeps",&lt;ref&gt;''ARI'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; with this famous  lake and [[Afqa]], source of the river Adonis on the other side of the mountain, which Pope asserted was closely associated with it in legend.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, "El in the Ugaritic Texts", (''Vetus Testamentum, Supplement'', II) 1955:61ff; approvingly reviewed by [[W. F. Albright]], in ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''75'''.3 (September 1956:255-257), who remarked, "However, the identification of El's home with a place in [[Phoenicia]]does not mean that it was not also at a great distance in a cosmic 'never never land'". The "cultic geography" of Adonis, including Afqa, is inspected by Brigitte Soyez in the opening section of ''Byblos et les fêtes des Adonies'' (Leiden: Brill) 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yammoune nature reserve==
The area has been classed as a scientific and cultural [[nature reserve]] since 1998 and is known for distinguishing [[juniper]] trees.&lt;ref name="CollectifLabourdette2011"/&gt; The area is popular as a [[hiking trail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhiafeeprogram.org/suggested_tours.pdf DHIAFEE Program, Suggested tours.]&lt;/ref&gt;
