[[File:The arrest of Adamites in a public square in Amsterdam. Etch Wellcome V0035701.jpg|thumb|The arrest of Neo-Adamites in a public square in Amsterdam]]

The '''Adamites''', or '''Adamians''',  were adherents of an [[Early Christian]] [[sect]] that gathered in [[Early centers of Christianity#North Africa|North Africa]] in the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd]], [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd]] and [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th centuries]]. There were later similar sects in Europe. They wore no clothing during their religious services.

== Ancient Adamites ==

The obscure sect, dating probably from the 2nd century, professed to have regained [[Adam]]'s primeval innocence. Various accounts are given of their origin. Some have thought them to have been an offshoot of the [[Carpocratian]] [[gnosticism|Gnostics]], who professed a sensual [[mysticism]] and a complete emancipation from the moral law. [[Theodoret]] (Haer. Fab., I, 6) held this view of them, and identified them with the licentious sects whose practices are described by [[Clement of Alexandria]]. Others, on the contrary, consider them to have been misguided [[asceticism|ascetic]]s, who strove to extirpate carnal desires by a return to simpler manners, and by the abolition of marriage.

[[Epiphanius of Salamis|St. Epiphanius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] mention the Adamites by name, and describe their practices. They called their church "[[Paradise]]", claiming that its members were re-established in [[Adam and Eve]]'s state of original innocence. Accordingly, they practiced "holy [[nudism]]", rejected the form of [[marriage]] as foreign to Eden, saying it would never have existed but for sin, lived in absolute [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]], holding that, whatever they did, their actions could be neither good nor bad&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Adamites|volume=1|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stripped themselves naked while engaged in common worship.

==Neo-Adamites==
Practices similar to those just described appeared in Europe several times in later ages. During the [[Middle Ages]] the doctrines of this obscure sect, which did not itself exist long, were revived:&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; in the 13th century in the [[Netherlands]] by the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] and the [[Taborite]]s in [[Bohemia]], and, in a grosser form, in the fourteenth by the [[Beguines and Beghards|Beghards]] in Germany. Everywhere they met with firm opposition from the mainstream churches.

The Taborite movement was started in 1419 in opposition to the authority of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. One sect of Taborites, the  Bohemian Adamites, dissociated themselves from other Taborites and took up the practice of going naked through towns and villages. They preached that "God dwelt in the Saints of the Last Days" and considered exclusive marriage to be a sin. The historian [[Norman Cohn]] observed: "Whereas the Taborites were strictly monogamous, in this sect free love seems to have been the rule. The Adamites declared that the chaste were unworthy to enter the Messianic kingdom ... The sect was much given to ritual naked dances held around a fire. Indeed, these people seemed to have spent much of their time naked, ignoring the heat and cold and claiming to be in the state of innocence enjoined by Adam and Eve." Cohn also commented that the Adamites were criticised by other Taborites for "never thinking of earning their own living by the work of their hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=From the Observer archive, 17 March 1974: the naked truth about streaking|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/mar/22/naked-truth-about-seventies-streaking-craze|author=Andrew Wilson|date=22 March 2015|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beghards became the [[Picards]] of Bohemia, who took possession of an island in the river [[Nežárka]], and lived communally, practicing social and religious nudity, [[free love]] and rejecting marriage and individual ownership of property. [[Jan Žižka]], the Hussite leader, nearly exterminated the sect in 1421.&lt;ref&gt;[[Konstantin von Höfler]], ''Geschichtsquellen Böhmens'', I, 414, 431.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, the sect was widely spread over Bohemia and [[Moravia]], and especially hated by the [[Hussites]] (whom they resembled in hatred toward the hierarchy) because they (the Adamites) rejected [[transubstantiation]], the [[priesthood]] and the [[Eucharist|Supper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Americana|wstitle=Adamites|year=1920|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strife between the Adamites and the Taborites is dramatized in ''[[Against All]]'', the third part of [[Otakar Vávra]]'s Hussite film trilogy (1958).{{sfn|Hames|2009|pp=21-}}

The splintering of Protestantism during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] in the 17th century saw Adamites recorded in the ''Catalogue of the Several Sects and Opinions in England.''&lt;ref name="Morrill2000"&gt;{{cite book|last= Goldie|first=Mark|editor-first=John |editor-last=Morrill|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor and Stuart Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xe0YCV2ad8gC&amp;pg=PA293|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-289327-7|chapter=The Search for Religious Liberty 1640-1690}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A revival of these doctrines took place in Bohemia in the region of [[Chrudim]] after 1781, owing to the edict of toleration issued by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]]. This secret group of Adamites was first mentioned in 1783, then again in 1849. However, a letter to the "Neues Wiener Tagblatt" in 1874, which claimed to be authored by Adamites in Vienna, appears to be a hoax.

== The Role of Intermediate Units ==
Pennsylvania’s intermediate units were created in 1971 in an effort to help school districts operate more efficiently and meet the specialized needs of their students.  Since then, these education agencies have evolved into an important resource on which school districts rely.

School districts and intermediate units are separate legal entities.  Intermediate units have no legal jurisdiction over school districts and do not control school districts.  On the contrary, intermediate units exist to serve school districts and provide leadership which will improve local operations.  Although intermediate units are an extension of the Pennsylvania Department of Education, they differ greatly from local school districts in several ways.

'''Anne Knight''' (2 November 1786 – 4 November 1862)&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; was a social reformer, abolitionist and a pioneer of [[feminism]]. She was at the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention|1840 Anti-Slavery convention]] where the need to improve women's rights became obvious.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In 1847 Knight produced what is considered the first leaflet for [[women's suffrage]]. She formed the first UK women's suffrage organisation in Sheffield in 1851.

==Family background==
Anne Knight was born in [[Chelmsford]] in 1786. She the daughter of William Knight (1756–1814), a [[Chelmsford, England|Chelmsford]] [[grocer]], and his wife Priscilla Allen (1753-1829). Her parent's families were both [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and several of their members took an active part in the [[Temperance movement|temperance]] and [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|anti-slavery]] movements.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Early efforts and frustrations==
In 1825 she was a member of the [[Chelmsford Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society]] when she toured Europe with a group of Quakers. The tour was part sightseeing but also took in good causes. Knight could speak in both French and German.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Knight worked closely with other leading abolitionist [[Thomas Clarkson]], [[Elizabeth Pease]] and [[Joseph Sturge]].

Her grandfather, [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]], is in the left foreground. Move your cursor to identify them or click the icon to enlarge}}
When women were prevented from participating in the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in [[London]] in 1840, Knight was outraged, and started to campaign for women's rights. A few women were included in the painting of the convention with Knight; these were [[Elizabeth Pease Nichol|Elizabeth Pease]], [[Amelia Opie]], [[Anne Isabella Noel Byron, 11th Baroness Wentworth|Baroness Byron]], [[Mary Anne Rawson]], [[Mrs John Beaumont]], [[John Harfield Tredgold|Elizabeth Tredgold]], [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s daughter-in-law and niece Mary and right at the back [[Lucretia Mott]].&lt;ref name=npg&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp00224&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=sit The Anti-Slavery Society Convention], 1840, [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]], accessed 19 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847 Knight produced what is considered the first leaflet for [[women's suffrage]]. Her efforts to impress the importance of women's suffrage on such reform leaders as [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] and [[Richard Cobden]] proved of little use, as did her efforts with the [[Chartism|Chartist]] leadership.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Edward H. Milligan: Knight, Anne (1786–1862). ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford: OUP, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47054 Retrieved 4 November 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight was described by the American Quaker [[Lucretia Mott]] in the 1840s as "a singular looking woman - very pleasant and polite."&lt;ref&gt;Edward H. Milligan: Knight, Anne (1786–1862).... Quoting F. B. Tolles, ed.: ''Slavery and 'the Woman Question' '' (London: Journal of the Friends Historical Society Supplement, 1952), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to France==
She moved to France in 1846 and participated in the revolution of 1848, and attended the international peace conference in Paris in 1849. With [[Jeanne Deroin]] she challenged the banning of women from political clubs and of publication of feminist material.  In 1851, she worked with [[Anne Kent]] to form the [[Sheffield Female Political Association]], the first British organisation to call for [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Death and commemorations==
Anne Knight never married. She died at [[Waldersbach]], near [[Strasbourg]], France, on 4 November 1862, at the house of the grandson of [[Jean-Frédéric Oberlin]] (1740–1820), a philanthropist whose work she revered.

A village, [[Knightsville, Jamaica|Knightsville]] in [[Jamaica]], was named after her, or possibly after her younger sister Maria (1791–1870), who visited the West Indies in the mid-1810s with the abolitionist John Candler (1787–1869).

Some of the new student accommodation at the [[University of Essex]], Anne Knight House, is named after her. So also is Anne Knight House, opened in January 2005 by the Colchester Quaker Housing Association a hostel for young people. A Grade II [[listed building]] opposite the [[Chelmsford railway station|railway station in Chelmsford]], her birthplace, used as a Quaker Meeting House from 1823 until the 1950s, was named Anne Knight Building in her honour. It formed part of the [[Anglia Ruskin University]] central campus until this was relocated in 2008. The building was subsequently vacant until 2015 when it enjoyed a brief period of use as a cultural project before being turned into a family-owned chain restaurant.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

'''Biji''' ({{Zh|筆記}}) is a genre in classical [[Chinese literature]]. It roughly translates "[[Notebook (style)|notebook]]". A book of biji can contain anecdotes, quotations, random musings, philological speculations, literary criticism and indeed everything that the author deems worth recording. The genre first appeared during the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] and [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin]] [[Dynasty|dynasties]], and matured during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. The biji of that period of time mostly contains the believe-it-or-not kind of anecdotes, and many of them can be treated as collections of [[short fiction]]s. To differentiate this kind of "biji fiction" from the general biji, the former is later called "biji xiaoshuo" (筆記小說 "notebook fictions"). Biji flourished during the [[Song Dynasty]], and continued to flourish during the later dynasties.

Famous works of biji include: 
*''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' (酉陽雜俎), by [[Duan Chengshi]], Tang Dynasty
*''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' (夢溪筆談) by [[Shen Kua]], Song Dynasty
*''Notebooks from the Rong Study'' (容齋隨筆) by [[Hong Mai]], Song Dynasty
*''Little Notes on the Nature of Things'' (物理小識) by [[Fang Yizhi]], [[Ming Dynasty]]

== Criticism and difficulties ==
Depicting objects of popular respect (religious subjects, flags, etc.) in art which includes body fluids can trigger public protests due to such material's historic association with dirtiness. The outcry about the ''[[Piss Christ]]'' photo is an example.&lt;ref name="HighPerformance"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2002/09/shooting_the_kl.php |work=Community Arts Network |title=Shooting the Klan: An Interview with Andres Serrano |last=Fusco |first=Coco |date=Fall 1991 |publisher=CommunityArtsNetwork |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419190933/http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2002/09/shooting_the_kl.php |archivedate=2011-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the obvious difficulties of preserving [[perishable]] material, there can be regulations complicating transport by rail, truck, or aircraft of liquid body fluids due to the fluids' possible classification as dangerous goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Air Transit Association page on DGR (Dangerous Goods Regulations)|url=http://www.iata.org/ps/publications/dgr/Pages/manuals.aspx|accessdate=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale of blood art via [[eBay]] is prohibited as eBay prohibits the sale of body parts, and classifies blood art as falling under this heading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood Art|url=http://www.artnewsblog.com/2005/03/blood-art.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224104631/http://www.artnewsblog.com/2005/03/blood-art.htm|archivedate=2008-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Branimir inscription''' ({{lang-hr|Natpis kneza Branimira}}) is the oldest preserved monument containing an inscription defining a [[Croatia|Croatian]] medieval ruler as a duke of [[Croats]] – ''{{Lang|la|Dux Cruatorum}}''. The inscription was originally a part of [[templon]] of a church built by [[Branimir of Croatia|Duke Branimir]], who ruled Croatia from 879–892.

== Description ==
The [[Inscription|inscribed]] [[Beam (structure)|beam]] and [[gable]] fragments contain a [[Latin language]] reference to Branimir as {{small|{{Lang|la|BRANIMIRO COM[ES]… DVX CRVATORṼ COGIT[AVIT]…}}}} ("the count Branimir… considered duke of the Croats…"). The first two words are inscribed on the {{convert|67|by|21|cm|abbr=on}} beam fragment, and the rest on the {{convert|74|to|81|cm|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|65|cm|abbr=on}} tall gable fragment. Both of the fragments have matching ornamentation along the top edge, with a cross executed in [[Croatian interlace]] on the gable and a pair of birds, one to either side of the cross. The fragments were originally parts of a [[templon]] in a church completed in the 9th century and consecrated to [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]]. The church was built by Branimir, who reigned in 879–892. The inscription is kept in [[Museum of Croatian Archaeological Monuments]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Benkovac Tourist Board|title=Natpis kneza Branimira|trans-title=Duke Branimir Inscription|language=Croatian|url=http://www.tz-benkovac.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=70&amp;Itemid=93&amp;lang=hr|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mužić195198"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivan Mužić|title=Hrvatska povijest devetoga stoljeća|trans-title=Croatian Ninth Century History|language=Croatian|url= http://www.muzic-ivan.info/hrvatska_povijest.pdf|format=PDF|isbn=978-953-263-034-3|year=2007|publisher=Naklada Bošković|accessdate=14 October 2011|pages=195–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Branimir.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Branimir Inscription, beam]]

The inscription is significant for the [[history of Croatia]] as it represents the oldest surviving reference to a Croatian ruler described as a ruler of a nation and the earliest recorded use of the particular name for [[Croats]]. &lt;ref name="Mužić195198"/&gt; There are four other preserved stone inscriptions mentioning Branimir, found in [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]], Ždrapanj near [[Skradin]], Otres near [[Bribir, Šibenik-Knin County|Bribir]] and in [[Muć|Muć Gornji]] near Split. The one found in Muć contains the consecration year, dating the inscription to year 888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YIAYMNOOe0YC&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;pg=PA91|title=Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250|author=Florin Curta|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-521-81539-0|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Radovi Zavoda za hrvatsku povijest|issn=0353-295X|publisher=[[University of Zagreb]], Faculty of Philosophy|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=79307|author=Ivan Botica|title=Recenzija, Prikaz - Na izvorima hrvatskoga zapadnoeuropskog identiteta, Mirjana Matijević Sokol - Vladimir Sokol (2005)|trans-title=Review - At the Sources of Croatian West European Identity, Mirjana Matijević Sokol - Vladimir Sokol (2005)|language=Croatian|date=November 2006|volume=38|issue=1|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possibly older reference to a Croatian [[ethnonym]] is attributed to a charter of duke [[Trpimir I of Croatia]] from the year 852. However, its original is lost, and only a 1568 copy is preserved, leading to doubts on the authenticity of the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivan Mužić|title=Hrvatska povijest devetoga stoljeća|trans-title=Croatian Ninth Century History|language=Croatian|url= http://www.muzic-ivan.info/hrvatska_povijest.pdf|format=PDF|isbn=978-953-263-034-3|year=2007|publisher=Naklada Bošković|accessdate=14 October 2011|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre for Deaf Studies is part of the School of Linguistic, Speech and Communication Sciences, [[Trinity College Dublin]] and is the only university offering [[Deaf studies|Deaf Studies]] related courses on the island of [[Ireland]].

The Centre originally offered a range of 2 year full-time Diploma courses in (i) ISL Teaching, (ii) ISL/English Interpreting and (iii) Deaf Studies. Since 2009, a 4-year honors Bachelor in Deaf Studies has been running. Students follow a common two-year programme, specializing in Deaf Studies or Interpreting or Teaching in the sophister years (third and fourth).

==History==
Established in 2001, following a decade of campaigning by the Irish Deaf Society, the Centre for Deaf Studies was originally located at Waterloo Lane, [[Dublin]] 4. By 2003, more space was needed and the Centre moved to the first floor of St. Vincent's Centre for the Deaf, [[Drumcondra, Dublin]] 9, where it remained until 2010. In autumn 2010, the Centre moved to its new home at 7-9 Leinster Street South, a College owned premises.

'''Part-time/occasional lecturers who have taught at the Centre for Deaf Studies over the years include:'''

Ms. Deirdre Byrne-Dunne,
Mr. Senan Dunne,
Ms. Dawn Duffin,
Dr. Colin Flynn,
Ms. Alvean Jones,
Mr. Brian Lynch,
Ms. Patricia Lynch (RIP),
Ms. Wendy Murray Snr.,
Ms. Wendy Murray Jnr.,
Dr. Patrick McDonnell,
Ms. Helena Saunders,
Ms. Laura Sadlier (RIP),
Ms. Gudny Thorvaldsdottir,
Ms. Nora Ungar.

The Centre for Deaf Studies is a constituent member of the Centre for Language and Communication Studies (CLCS), TCD. Staff from CLCS and the Department of Clinical Speech and Language Studies (CSLS), our 'sisters' in the School of Linguistic, Speech and Communication Sciences, contribute to teaching.

'''Colleagues from the School who have contributed to teaching over the years include:'''

Dr. Vania Aguiar,
Dr. Jeffrey Kallen,
Prof. David Little,
Dr. Breffni O'Rourke,
Dr. Heath Rose,
Prof. David Singleton,

==Research==
The Centre has engaged in a wide range of research activity in its decade to date. Work includes the development of the Signs of Ireland corpus, a digital multimodal corpus annotated in ELAN. The Signs of Ireland corpus is used in teaching and learning at the Centre and was the basis for Lorraine Leeson and John Saeed's volume describing the linguistic and sociolinguistic situation of [[Irish Sign Language]] (Edinburgh University Press, 2011).

Other work has centered on the application of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] to ISL teaching and assessment, the assessment of interpreters, [[deaf education]], interpreters in educational contexts, interpreters in medical contexts, interpreters in [[mental health]] settings, etc.

The '''Laura Sadlier Freshman Prize''' and the '''Laura Sadlier Sophister Award''' were officially founded in 2014 in recognition of the outstanding contributions made to the Centre for Deaf Studies by Laura Sadlier. These prizes will be presented annually to Junior Freshman students from the Centre for Deaf Studies who have demonstrated significant improvement in ISL proficiency and/or cultural engagement with the Deaf Community and to Senior Sophister students from the Centre for Deaf Studies. The recipient of this award will have demonstrated academic achievement, collegiality and engagement with the Deaf Community during the course of their studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishdeaf.com/kerry-deaf-resource-centre-update-24-11-14/&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Community education''', also known as '''community-based education''' or '''community learning &amp; development''', is an organization's programs to promote learning and social development work with individuals and groups in their communities using a range of formal and informal methods. A common defining feature is that programmes and activities are developed in dialogue with communities and participants. The purpose of community learning and development is to develop the capacity of individuals and groups of all ages through their actions, the capacity of communities, to improve their quality of life. Central to this is their ability to participate in democratic processes.&lt;ref name="workingtogether"&gt;Working and Learning Together to Build Stronger Communities, Scottish Government Guidance for Community Learning and Development, 2004 seen at the[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Life-Long-Learning/LearningConnections Community Learning and Development], Scottish Government Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Community education encompasses all those occupations and approaches that are concerned with running education and development programmes within local communities, rather than within educational institutions such as schools, colleges and universities. The latter is known as the formal education system, whereas community education is sometimes called informal education. It has long been critical of aspects of the formal education system for failing large sections of the population in all countries and had a particular concern for taking learning and development opportunities out to poorer areas, although it can be provided more more broadly.

There are a myriad of job titles and employers include public authorities and voluntary or non-governmental organisations, funded by the state and by independent grant making bodies. Schools, colleges and universities may also support community learning and development through outreach work within communities. The community schools movement has been a strong proponent of this since the sixties. Some universities and colleges have run outreach adult education programmes within local communities for decades. Since the seventies the prefix word ‘community’ has also been adopted by several other occupations from youth workers and health workers to planners and architects, who work with more disadvantaged groups and communities and have been influenced by community education and community development approaches.

Community educators have over many years developed a range of skills and approaches for working within local communities and in particular with disadvantaged people. These include less formal educational methods, community organising and group work skills. Since the nineteen sixties and seventies through the various anti poverty programmes in both developed and developing countries, practitioners have been influenced by structural analyses as to the causes of disadvantage and poverty i.e. inequalities in the distribution of wealth, income, land etc. and especially political power and the need to mobilise people power to effect social change. Thus the influence of such educators as Paulo Friere and his focus upon this work also being about politicising the poor.

In the history of community education and community learning and development, the UK has played a significant role in hosting the two main international bodies representing community education and community development. These being the International Community Education Association, which was for many years based at the Community Education Development Centre based in Coventry UK. ICEA and CEDC have now closed, and the International Association for Community Development, which still has its HQ in Scotland. In the 1990s there was some thought as to whether these two bodies might merge. The term community learning and development has not taken off widely in other countries. Although community learning and development approaches are recognised internationally. These methods and approaches have been acknowledged as significant for local social, economic, cultural, environmental and political development by such organisations as the [[UN]], [[WHO]], [[OECD]], [[World Bank]], [[Council of Europe]] and EU.

==In the UK==

In the UK the term community learning and development has now been widely adopted as describing a discrete employment sector of occupations concerned with outreach education and development work in local communities. In 1999 a UK wide organisation responsible for setting professional training standards for education and development practitioners working within local communities  was established. This organisation was called PAULO – the National Training Organisation for Community Learning and Development. (It was named after Paulo Freire.) It was formally recognised by David Blunket, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment in the New Labour Government in January 1999. It brought together a range of occupational interests under a single national training standards body, these being, adult education, youth work, community development and development education. The inclusion of community development was significant as it was initially uncertain as to whether it would join the NTO for Social Care.

The Community Learning and Development NTO represented all the main employers, trades unions, professional associations and national development agencies working in this area across the four nations of the UK. This was the first time that the informal education occupations across the UK had ever come together with the common purpose of creating a publicly recognised occupational sector, in the way that school teachers or college lecturers had long been publicly and officially recognised.

The term 'community learning and development' was adopted to acknowledge that all of these occupations worked primarily within local communities, and that this work encompassed not just providing less formal learning support but also a concern for the wider holistic development of those communities – socio-economically, environmentally, culturally and politically. In effect this brought together for the first time two traditions. The former group of occupations – adult educators, youth workers and community education workers had tended to focus upon the provision of informal education support for individuals and groups within communities. They had always seen their work as being educational. The latter group – community workers, community development workers and development educators had tended to focus upon the socio-economic and environmental development of those communities. Both sets of occupations recognised that they shared very similar values, knowledge base and skill sets and that what brought them together was a common commitment to supporting learning and social action.

By bringing together these occupational groups this created for the first time a single recognised employment sector of nearly 300,000 full and part-time paid staff within the UK, approximately 10% of these staff being full-time. The NTO continued to recognise the range of different occupations within it, for example specialists who work primarily with young people, but all agreed that they shared a core set of professional approaches to their work.

In 2002 the New Labour Government announced that it wished to cluster NTOs, of which there were over 50 covering a wide range of occupations across the UK labour market, under a smaller number of what they called Sector Skills Councils. A Sector Skills Council was formed called the Lifelong Learning UK Sector Skills Council. PAULO became one of five discrete pillars within LLUK, the others being the former NTOs for Further Education, for Universities, for Library and information Services and for Work Based Education. Over nearly a decade LLUK did a large amount of labour market mapping, as well as setting standards for the professional training of people working in the CLD area and generally promoted the identity of this sector across wider UK public policies and the public, non governmental and private sector employers.

All Sector Skills Councils in the UK including LLUK were abolished by the Conservative/Liberal coalition Government in 2011 and at the time of writing it is uncertain as to whether a single body representing the professional community learning and development sector will be sustained. The Community and Youth Workers Union which is part of the Unite Union in the UK played the lead role in improving employee’s conditions across the sector but never succeeded in representing all employees within the CLD sector and is not widely represented across all parts of the UK.

The Scottish Government has continued to recognise community learning and development as a discrete employment sector, and has for over a decade supported CLD training for people wishing to work professionally in this area. There is a team of HMI (Her Majesties Inspectors) to inspect the quality of delivery by employers. In 2007 the Scottish Government established a Scottish Standards Council for Community Learning and Development. This organisation oversees quality standards in the professional training of staff working in this field, including the validation and endorsement of professional training courses and is introducing a professional registration scheme for such qualified practitioners. It has continued much of the work of the former LLUK as it operated in Scotland.

At the present time similar CLD Standards Councils have not been set up in other parts of the UK and it does appear that the sector outside Scotland is once again becoming more fragmented. Unlike the formal education sector there is virtually no legislation in the UK underpinning the need to provide and fund community learning and development. Consequently, it has been vulnerable to cuts in public expenditure due to the recession, particularly projects that were seen as too radical.

== National priorities ==

Three national priorities have been developed for community learning and development in Scotland:

;Achievement through learning for adults
Raising standards of achievement in learning for adults through community-based lifelong learning opportunities incorporating the core skills of literacy, numeracy, communications, working with others, problem solving and information communications technology (ICT).

;Achievement through learning for young people
Engaging with young people to facilitate their personal, social and educational development and enable them to gain a voice, influence and place in society.

;Achievement through building community capacity
Building community capacity and influence by enabling people to develop the confidence, understanding and skills required to influence decision making and service delivery.

== Principles and competences ==

Competent CLD workers will ensure that their work supports social change and social justice and is based on the values of CLD. Their approach is collaborative, anti-discriminatory and equalities-focused and they work with diverse individuals, communities of place or interest when this is or is not appropriate. Central to their practice is challenging discrimination and its consequences and working with individuals and communities to shape learning and development activities that enhance quality of life and sphere of influence. They have good interpersonal and listening skills and their practice demonstrates that they value and respect the knowledge, experience and aspirations of those involved.&lt;ref name="Competences"&gt;The Competences for Community Learning &amp; Development, 2009 seen at {{cite web |url=http://www.cldstandardscouncil.org.uk/cld/202.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121224014134/http://www.cldstandardscouncil.org.uk/cld/202.html |archivedate=2012-12-24 |df= }}, CLD Standards Council Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Government have introduced the following set of principles of which community learning and development related activities should be based on:

# Empowerment – increasing the ability of individuals and groups to influence issues that affect them and their communities;
# Participation – supporting people to take part in decision making;
# Inclusion, equality of opportunity and anti-discrimination – recognising that some people may need additional support to overcome the barriers they face;
# Self-determination – supporting the right of people to make their own choices; and
#Partnership – recognising that many agencies can contribute to CLD to ensure resources are used effectively.

== Wisconsin Model ==

A philosophical base for developing Community Education programs is provided through the five components of the [[Wisconsin]] Model of Community Education. The model provides a process framework for local school districts to implement or strengthen community education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpi.wi.gov/fscp/ce5comp.html Wisconsin's Components of Community Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629071334/http://dpi.wi.gov/fscp/ce5comp.html |date=2008-06-29 }}, Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction&lt;/ref&gt; A set of Community Education Principles was developed by Larry Horyna and Larry Decker for the National Coalition for Community Education in 1991
&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpi.wi.gov/fscp/ceprin.html Community Education Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917174322/http://dpi.wi.gov/fscp/ceprin.html |date=2008-09-17 }}, Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

# Self-determination: Local people are in the best position to identify community needs and wants. Parents, as children's first and most important teachers, have both a right and a responsibility to be involved in their children's education.
# Self-help: People are best served when their capacity to help themselves is encouraged and enhanced. When people assume ever-increasing responsibility for their own well being, they acquire independence rather than dependence.
# Leadership Development: The identification, development, and use of the leadership capacities of local citizens are prerequisites for ongoing self-help and community improvement efforts.
# Localization: Services, programs, events, and other community involvement opportunities that are brought closest to where people live have the greatest potential for a high level of public participation. Whenever possible, these activities should be decentralized to locations of easy public access.
# Integrated Delivery of Services: Organizations and agencies that operate for the public good can use their limited resources, meet their own goals, and better serve the public by establishing close working relationships with other organizations and agencies with related purposes.
# Maximum Use of Resources: The physical, financial, and human resources of every community should be interconnected and used to their fullest if the diverse needs and interests of the community are to be met.
# Inclusiveness: The segregation or isolation of people by age, income, sex, race, ethnicity, religion, or other factors inhibits the full development of the community. Community programs, activities, and services, should involve the broadest possible cross section of community residents.
# Responsiveness: Public institutions have a responsibility to develop programs and services that respond to the continually changing needs and interests of their constituents.
# Lifelong Learning: Learning begins at our birth and continues until death.  Formal and informal learning opportunities should be available to residents of all ages in a wide variety of community settings.

==Role of the professional==

The role of a community learning and development professional depends somewhat on the career path followed. For example, someone working with young people may have different priorities than someone working with adults; however, the outcomes are very similar in a sense that both will be aiming to promote a more socially just and equal society. Community learning and development is a vast field of work and the range of job categories is wide and may include the following: Youth Information Worker, Detached Youth Worker, Community Arts Worker, Community Capacity Worker, Local Authority Community Planning Officer, etc.

Community learning and development workers should see themselves as working with people, rather than for them. Empathy is crucial to understanding the issues faced by those they work with and it is important that they engage in a way that does not intimidate people or place the worker in a position of looking down on those they work with.

The role of a Community learning and development worker is largely different from the role of a formal educator such as a teacher. Community learning and development workers do not follow a curriculum, as they allow the people they work with to form their own way of learning and each individual is believed to have the ability to reach their full potential in life. A community learning and development approach is arguably a more effective way of learning as every individual has their own unique way to learn and community learning and development workers look for the best possible method that suits the individual. Community learning and development approaches are gradually being adopted in schools to some extent and many other agencies and using a community learning and development approach in their work.

In Canada, a university in Alberta has created a Community-based Bachelor of Education program to prepare teachers for rural community education, making it the first university program in Canada that aims at preparing teachers for rural community education.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elaine, Gereluk, Dressler, Roswita; Sandra|first=Eaton, Sarah; Dianne; Dressler; Becker|date=April 30, 2017|title=A rural education teacher preparation program: course design, student support and engagement|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=eric&amp;AN=ED573898&amp;site=eds-live&amp;authtype=ip,guest&amp;custid=s1226370&amp;groupid=main&amp;profile=eds|journal=ERIC, EBSCOhost|volume=|pages=1–15|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Qualifications ===

Professional community educators or community learning and development workers usually hold a professional degree in community education or community learning and development, depending on the course offered at the university from which they graduate. In [[Scotland]], qualifications may be Approved by the Standards Council for Community Learning and Development. This means that the course has been assessed by a group of peers - an Approval Panel. The course must have a practice element totalling 40% of the course to gain Approval. More details on the Approval Process and a list of Approved qualifications are available on the Standards Council website www.cldstandardscouncil.org.uk In order to gain entrance to this course, a history of voluntary work is usually desirable.

Many of those working in the field of community learning and development will be doing so voluntarily. These people are usually encouraged to complete a work-place based alternative to the full-time degree course. Others in paid positions may hold qualifications relevant to the field. These people will also be encouraged to study for a degree in community education.

Some university institutions offer post-graduate degrees in community education such as MA, MSc, PGDip, PGCert, etc.

== Participatory democracy ==

===Youth participation===
In countries where democratic governments exist, people are encouraged to vote for someone to represent them. In today's society there is a dwindling interest in politics from our younger generation and this could have a negative effect on our democracy and political system in years to come. Community learning and development has the potential to encourage young people to become more interested in politics and helping them influence decisions that affect their lives.

In many parts of the world, youth parliament-style organisations have been set up to allow young people to debate issues that affect them and others in their community. Young people engage with these organisations voluntarily and are sometimes elected using a democratic system of voting. Young people are at the heart of these organisations and are usually involved in the management and development. The majority of these organisations are facilitated and staffed by workers trained in community learning and development; however, staff role is mainly to facilitate and be supportive but not intrusive.

These organisations allow young people to gain a voice, influence decision makers who affect their lives and provide them with a sense of self-worth and a place in society.

In the United Kingdom, examples of these organisations include the [[United Kingdom Youth Parliament]] (UKYP); in Scotland, the [[Scottish Youth Parliament]] (SYP); in Wales the Children &amp; Young People's Assembly for Wales; and in Northern Ireland, the [http://www.niyf.org/ Northern Ireland Youth Forum]. In Canada, examples include [[Youth Parliament of Manitoba]] (YPM), [[Saskatchewan Youth Parliament]] (SYP), [[TUXIS Parliament of Alberta]] (TUXIS), and [[British Columbia Youth Parliament]] (BCYP).

=== Parental participation ===
Cultural divides and deficit thinking creates mutual distrust between marginalized parents and schools which in turn creates barriers to active parental involvement of marginalized parents in the education of their children.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auerbach|first=Susan|date=May 2007|title=From moral supporters to struggling advocates - Reconceptualizing parent roles in education through the experience of working-class families of color|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edswss&amp;AN=000245968700004&amp;site=eds-live&amp;authtype=ip,guest&amp;custid=s1226370&amp;groupid=main&amp;profile=eds|journal=Web of Science|volume=42|pages=250–283|via=Social Sciences Citation Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researches also show that parents of high socio-economic status play active and direct role in the education of their children and are more likely to influence school policies that affects their children's schooling whereas parents of low socio-economic status play indirect roles in the education of their children and are less likely to influence school policies that affects their children's schooling.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The gap between parents' educational involvement among parents from higher socio-economic status and parents from lower socio-economic status results in a more personalized education that caters for the needs of children from higher socio-economic backgrounds and more alienating and generic education systems/policies for students from low socio-economic backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The following practices are necessary for parent and community participation in the education of their wards to be effective; students come to school healthy and ready to learn, parents assist schools with financial and or material support, there are frequent communications between parents and school authorities, parents have meaningful authorities in the schools and they also assist in the teaching of their children.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schools count: World Bank project designs and the quality of primary education in Sub-Saharan Africa|last=Ward &amp; Craig|first=Heneveld &amp; Helen|publisher=World Bank|year=1996|isbn=|location=United States|pages=11–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents' home based educational involvement such as creating an enabling learning environment at home, helping their children with their assignments, helping their children develop cognitive skills and other school skills and motivating their children to do well in school supports student success.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seginer|first=Rachel|date=Spring 2006|title=Parents' Educational Involvement: A Developmental Ecology Perspective.|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=19381256&amp;site=eds-live&amp;authtype=ip,guest&amp;custid=s1226370&amp;groupid=main&amp;profile=eds|journal=Parenting: Science and Practice|volume=6|pages=1–48|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researches show that multimodal and effective migrant parental involvement in the education of their children increases the test scores of such students and also shows strong student success even after academic abilities and socio-economic status are taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopez, Scribner &amp; Mahitivanichcha|first=Gerardo, Jay $ Kanya|date=Summer 2001|title=Redefining Parental Involvement: Lessons from High-Performing Migrant-Impacted Schools|jstor=3202459|journal=American Educational Research Journal|volume=38|pages=253–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School officials' racial stereotypes , class stereotypes, biases and attitudes regarding parental involvement in the education of their children hinders school officials from involving parents as partners in the education of their children.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hornby &amp; Lafaele|first=Garry &amp; Rayleen|date=February 2011|title=Barriers to parental involvement in education: an explanatory model.|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=57482902&amp;site=eds-live&amp;authtype=ip,guest&amp;custid=s1226370&amp;groupid=main&amp;profile=eds|journal=Education Review|volume=63|pages=37–52|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, bureaucracies in the public education systems hinders parents from advocating for changes that would benefit their children.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Formally organized parental associations in schools that seeks to increase parental involvement, ignore the cultural and socio-economic needs of minorities, thereby  contributing to the barriers of parental involvement, especially for marginalized parents.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Research shows that high number of marginalized parents do not actively engage in their children's schooling.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; There is also a wide gap between the rhetoric of best parental involvement practices and actual parental involvement practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Effective parental Involvement in the education of their children involves; parenting, communication, volunteering, home tutoring, involvement in decision-making, and collaboration with the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Effective Parental Involvement treats and or makes school officials and parents partners in the education of their children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{For|other kinds of conflict|conflict (disambiguation)}}
'''Cultural conflict''' is a type of [[conflict (process)|conflict]] that occurs when different [[culture|cultural]] [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[belief]]s clash. It has been used to explain violence and crime.

==Wider definition==
[[Jonathan H. Turner]] defines it as a conflict caused by "differences in [[culture|cultural]] [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[belief]]s that place people at odds with one another".&lt;ref name="Turner2005-87"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan H. Turner|authorlink=Jonathan H. Turner|title=Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90vMAAAACAAJ|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-113496-6|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On a micro level, Alexander Grewe discusses a cultural conflict between guests of different culture and nationality as seen in a British 1970 sitcom, ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''.&lt;ref name="Grewe2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Grewe|title="I'm sick to death with you..." or External Character Conflicts in Fawlty Towers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRnUcigKzqEC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=17 October 2005|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-638-42885-9|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines this conflict as one that occurs when '''people's''' expectations of a certain behavior coming from their cultural backgrounds are not met, as others have different cultural backgrounds and different expectations.&lt;ref name="Grewe2005"/&gt;

Cultural conflicts are difficult to resolve as parties to the conflict have different beliefs.&lt;ref name="Turner2005-83"/&gt;  Cultural conflicts intensify when those differences become reflected in [[politics]], particularly on a macro level.&lt;ref name="Turner2005-83"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan H. Turner|authorlink=Jonathan H. Turner|title=Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90vMAAAACAAJ|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-113496-6|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of cultural conflict is [[Abortion debate|the debate]] over [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="Turner2005-83"/&gt; [[Ethnic cleansing]] is another extreme example of cultural conflict.&lt;ref name="AndersenTaylor2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret L. Andersen|author2=Howard F. Taylor|title=Sociology: The Essentials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTvpA0P3u-gC&amp;pg=PT72|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-83156-1|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wars can also be a result of a cultural conflict; for example the differing views on [[slavery]] were one of the reasons for the [[American civil war]].&lt;ref name="Fellman1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Fellman|title=Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri During the American Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LldHnF7CB3kC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=19 April 1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-506471-1|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrow definition==
A more narrow definition of a cultural conflict dates to [[Daniel Bell]]'s 1962 essay, "Crime as an American Way of Life", and focuses on [[criminal]]-enabling consequences of a clash in cultural values.&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Kornblum|title=Sociology in a Changing World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtKcG6qoY5AC&amp;pg=PT191|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=31 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-30157-6|pages=191–192; 195, 197, 205}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Kornblum]] defines it as a conflict that occurs when conflicting [[Norm (social)|norm]]s create "opportunities for deviance and criminal gain in deviant [[sub-culture]]s".&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"/&gt; Kornblum notes that whenever laws impose cultural values on a group that does not share those views (often, this is the case of the majority imposing their laws on a minority), illegal markets supplied by criminals are created to circumvent those laws.&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"/&gt; He discusses the example of [[prohibition]] in the [[interbellum]] United States, and notes how the cultural conflict between pro- and anti-alcohol groups created opportunities for illegal activity; another similar example he lists is that of the [[war on drugs]].&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"/&gt;

Kornblum also classifies the cultural conflict as one of the major types of [[conflict theory]].&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"/&gt;  In ''[[The Clash of Civilizations]]'' [[Samuel P. Huntington]] proposes that people's cultural and religious identities will be the primary source of conflict in the post-[[Cold War]] world.

==Influence and understanding==
Michelle LeBaron describes different cultures as "underground rivers that run through our lives and relationships, giving us messages that shape our perceptions, attributions, judgments, and ideas of self and other".&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondintractability.org/bi-essay/culture-conflict |title=Culture and Conflict |publisher=Beyond Intractability |date= |accessdate=2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states that cultural messages "shape our understandings" when two or more people are present in regards to relationships, conflict, and peace.&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; LeBaron discusses the influence of culture as being powerful and "unconscious, influencing conflict and attempts to resolve conflict in imperceptible ways".&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; She states that the impact of culture is huge, affecting "name, frame, blame, and attempt to tame conflicts".&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; Due to the huge impact that culture has on us, LeBaron finds it important to explain the "complications of conflict".&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; First, "culture is multi-layered", meaning that "what you see on the surface may mask differences below the surface".&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; Second, "culture is constantly in flux", meaning that "cultural groups adapt in dynamic and sometimes unpredictable ways".&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; Third, "culture is elastic", meaning that one member of a cultural group may not participate in the norms of the culture.&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; Lastly, "culture is largely below the surface", meaning that it isn't easy to reach the deeper levels of culture and its meanings.&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt;

'''Dining rights''', in the United Kingdom, are the right to use the dining facilities offered to the members (and possibly their guests, when accompanied by a member) of certain organisations such as universities, clubs, colleges and bodies such as the [[House of Lords]], and the [[Hawks' Club]].

They are typically offered to ex-members of such institutions, alumni, or individuals who are in some way involved with furthering its aims, often in the spirit of [[honoris causa]]. Such rights can be highly sought after.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

As dining is considered a highly social process, dining rights permit diners to engage with like-minded colleagues, members and their guests in a milieu that is less formal (but may still contain certain formalities) than that of the academic meeting, [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquium]] or [[seminar]].

Such rights do not usually permit the holder to take part in the management or the functions of the institution that has offered them.

Such rights do not (usually) exempt the holder from any charges for using them, though they are extended to the holder on the same basis as the usual holders of such rights. However, restrictions are typically placed upon their frequency of use.

Holders are usually held responsible for both the bills incurred by themselves and their guests, and the behaviour of their guests during the exercise of such rights.

Typically [[alumni]] of a college or university may be offered such rights, but only on payment of a fee, and after holding an appropriate [[academic degree]], or after a number of years since [[graduation]].

[[File:Logo DutchCulture.jpg|thumb|top|DutchCulture, centre for international cooperation logo]]

'''DutchCulture''' operates in the areas of culture, media and heritage. DutchCulture is the result of a merger of SICA, [[Trans Artists Foundation|Trans Artists]] and MEDIA Desk Netherlands. The organisation will also take up the tasks that were assigned to the discontinued Netherlands Institute for Heritage. DutchCulture is  located at Herengracht 474 in Amsterdam since 1 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sica.nl/en/content/en-us-new-name-dutchculture-centre-international-cooperation |title=New name: DutchCulture, centre for international cooperation &amp;#124; SICA |publisher=Sica.nl |date=2013-09-16 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amsterdam - Herengracht 474.JPG|thumb|left|Herengracht 474, Amsterdam]]
DutchCulture is supported with a four-year grant from both the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The merging organisations SICA, Trans Artists and MEDIA Desk had been active in the field of international cultural cooperation for years.

The merger into DutchCulture puts together the different expertise, networks and experience. DutchCulture’s activities include: cultural programming of the bilateral Netherlands-Russia year 2013; informing and advising about European cultural funding programmes; expertise with Artist-in-Residence programmes globally; reinforcing Dutch cultural cooperation with China, Turkey and Brazil; organising working visits for Dutch embassy staff and international experts; creating and maintaining (online) databases focusing on export of Dutch culture and cultural mappings of several countries.

DutchCulture offers services to ministries and local authorities, artists and cultural organisations, embassies, the creative industries sector, civil society and the business sector.

The Cultural Heritage Desk of DutchCulture strengthens shared heritage collaboration between Dutch and foreign heritage organisations, Netherlands embassies and Dutch agencies.

They also manage the foreign visitors programme and a matching fund for [[Dutch Mutual Cultural Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalheritageconnections.org/wiki/Mutual_Cultural_Heritage |title=Mutual Cultural Heritage |publisher=Cultural Heritage Connections |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A programme council advises them on the applications of this fund. The programme council exists of four experts Martine Gosselink, Gert Oostindie, Diederik Six, Joost Schokkenbroek and a representative from DutchCulture. Representatives of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands]] and the [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (Netherlands)|Ministry of Education, Culture and Science of the Netherlands]] take part in the council as observers.

:''For the American spy, see [[Frederick Mayer (spy)]]''
[[Image:Frederick mayer memory.jpg|thumb|right|Frederick Mayer]] '''Frederick Mayer''' (11 August 1921, [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] - 26 June 2006, [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]) was an educational scientist and philosopher of the [[University of Redlands]], [[California]] and one of the leading [[creativity]] experts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} One of his most important aims was a global humanism. Until the very last days of his life he was active as an author. More than sixty books deal with creativity, education and humanism. Internationally recognized creativity researcher Frederick Mayer in Vienna died. Mayer was particularly affected by the quote "Pride is not for him who loves his country, but for him who loves the whole world."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5215">[[File:100 Fu (a papercut).JPG|thumb|A papercut showing the character ''Fú'' written in 100 different ways (11 x 9 plus 1)&lt;ref&gt;Welch, ''Chinese Art'', p. 4, ''by permission of the author''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''character ''Fú''''' ({{audio|Zh-fú.ogg|福|help=no}}, [[Unicode]] U+798F) meaning "fortune" or "good luck" is represented both as a Chinese ideograph, but also at times [[pictorial]]ly, in one of its [[homophone|homophonous]] forms. It is often found on a figurine of the male god of the same name, one of the trio of "star gods" [[Fu Lu Shou|''Fú, Lù, Shòu'']].

Mounted ''Fú'' are a widespread [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] tradition associated with [[Chinese New Year]] and can be seen on the entrances of many Chinese homes worldwide.  The characters are generally printed on a square piece of paper or stitched in fabric. The practice is universal among Chinese people regardless of [[socioeconomic status]], and dates to at least the [[Song Dynasty]] (AD 960 – 1279).

When displayed as a Chinese ideograph, ''Fú'' is often displayed upside-down on diagonal red squares. The reasoning is based on a [[wordplay]]: in nearly all [[varieties of Chinese]]: the words for "upside-down" (倒, Pinyin: dào) and "to arrive" (到, Pinyin: dào) are [[homophone|homophonous]]. Therefore, the phrase an "upside-down ''Fú''" sounds nearly identical to the phrase "Good luck arrives". Pasting the character upside-down on a door or doorpost thus translates into a wish for prosperity to descend upon a dwelling.

Another story states that posting the character upside-down originates with the family of a 9th-century prince of the [[Qing Dynasty]]{{citation needed|reason=9th century was Tang Dynasty. Qing Dynasty started at 1644|date=January 2014}}. The story states that on one Chinese New Year's Eve (or ''Chuxi'', {{zh|c=除夕}}), the prince's servants played a practical joke by pasting ''fu'' characters throughout his royal dwelling. One illiterate servant inadvertently placed the characters upside-down. The prince was said to have been furious upon seeing the characters, but a quick-thinking servant humbly calmed the prince by saying that the occurrence must have been a sign of prosperity "arriving" upon his household by using the above wordplay.

Bats (蝠) are the most ubiquitous of all Chinese symbols with the same symbolic meaning as the ideograph "fortune" (福).&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, ''Chinese Art: A Guide to Motifs and Visual Imagery'', Tuttle Publishing, 2008, pp. 112–3.&lt;/ref&gt; A less common representation is bran (麸子), not only because "depictions of grain have been used throughout Chinese history to represent fecundity"&lt;ref&gt;Welch, ''Chinese Art'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; but also in combination with other grains with related homophonous word-plays (for example, ''lì'' which can mean either "grain" 粒 or "profit" 利).&lt;ref&gt;Welch, ''Chinese Art'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the character ''Fú'' (福) in various forms of calligraphy and seal characters as papercuts or posters represents the desire that one's good luck will be expansive and come in many forms. Chinese textiles and ceramics often found transcribe this felicitous message by portraying random numbers of bats in flight, sometimes can be more than a hundred.

Since 2017, the version 10 of the [[Unicode]] Standard features a rounded version of the character in the "Enclosed Ideographic Supplement" block, at code point U+1F260 (ROUNDED SYMBOL FOR FU).&lt;ref name="unicode"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unicode Standard, Version 10.0, Enclosed Ideographic Supplement|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-10.0/U100-1F200.pdf|website=unicode.org|publisher=The Unicode Consortium|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gosei'' is a term used in these geographic areas outside Japan.  ''Gosei'' characterizes the child of at least one ''Yonsei'' (fourth generation) parent.  Differences among these national ''Gosei'' developed because of the varying historical processes throuogh which their Japanese emigrant forebears became Nikkei.&lt;ref&gt;Ichioka, Yuji '' et al.''

}}

The '''Greek mafia''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ελληνική μαφία ''Ellinikí mafía'') is the colloquial term used to refer to various [[organized crime]] elements originating from [[Greece]]. Indigenous organized criminal groups are well-entrenched in the largest Greek urban centers, particularly in [[Athens]]. Organized crime has thrived in Greece in part thanks to the widespread political corruption in the country itself.&lt;ref name="loc.gov"&gt;https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Nats_Hospitable.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek mafia should not be confused with Greek street gangs, who take part in smaller street crime. Outside of the domestic Greek criminal organizations, the [[Sicilian Mafia]], [[Camorra]], and [[Albanian mafia|Albanian]], [[Russian mob|Russian]] and [[Georgian mafia]] groups have been operating in Greece in collaboration with the domestic criminal syndicates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flarenetwork.org/media/files/echo2_oc-and-drugs-in-greece.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the term "Greek mafia" may also include or refer specifically to various [[Greek-American]] organized crime groups. Notable ethnic Greek or Greek-American organized crime groups in the United States include the [[Philadelphia Greek Mob]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and the [[Velentzas crime family]] in [[New York City]]. Greek-American crime groups vary in the extent of their connections to Greek mafia groups in Europe; some Greek-American crime groups may be only loosely connected or even completely independent of Greek mafia groups in Europe, while certain Greek-American crime groups may essentially be American extensions of Greek mafia groups in Europe.

==Godfathers of the night==
Greek crime bosses are locally described as νονοί της νύχτας (translated as "Godfathers of the night"). Largely operating as owners of [[nightclubs]], Greek crime groups are able to operate their illegal businesses from there on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espressonews.gr/%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B5%CF%87%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%BF/%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B8%CF%81%CE%BF/%CF%81%CE%B5%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%B6/116748/%CF%80%CE%AD%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%BF-%CF%84%CF%81%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%85-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%BD%CF%8D%CF%87%CF%84%CE%B1|title=Πέπλο τρόμου στη νύχτα|work=Espresso|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[Sicilian mafia]] or the [[Albanian mafia]], Greek criminal groups follow the same structure organized gangs have within the ''[[Milieu (organized crime in France)|French Milieu]]'' or the ''[[Penose]]'' in the [[Netherlands]]. Domestically, they are largely smaller organized crime cells, sometimes family-based, who collaborate but from time to time also feud with one another. 
There are close to 217 known domestic crime lords operating in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://directnews.gr/greece/2017-2011-04-02-15-05-15.html|title=Νονοί της νύχτας: Τα μεγάλα ονόματα|author=artemis|work=Direct News|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, the smuggling and racketeering practices have a larger reach, and are not necessarily based on Greek nationals alone. With the need to infiltrate and manipulate multiple types of businesses in order to successfully smuggle internationally, more often than not such organisations resemble professional international [[cartels]] rather than traditional organised crime groups.

==Activities==
A substantial number of Greek organised crime groups are centered in Athens. However, many other (semi) organised groups operate throughout other cities, and even villages. Criminal clans can have their origins from all over Greece:  Mafia groups in the bigger cities are especially involved in [[racketeering]], the illegal smuggling of [[oil]], [[money laundering]], [[weapon trafficking|weapon]] and [[drug trafficking]] as well as murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.pathfinder.gr/greece/news/452071.html |title=Pathfinder.gr - Καθημερινή ενημέρωση με ειδήσεις και θέματα από την Ελλάδα και τον κόσμο |author=phaistos networks s.a. |work=Pathfinder |accessdate=26 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201850/http://news.pathfinder.gr/greece/news/452071.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal groups on the Greek mainland have also profited from the activities of corrupt officials. [[Arms trafficking|Arms]], [[drug trafficking|narcotics]] and illegal [[oil]] are smuggled by Greek criminal organizations, often in collaboration with [[Albanian mafia|Albanian]] or [[Russian mafia]] groups, from local seaports to important destination centers such as the docks of [[Naples]] or [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt;
(Cretan mafia) 
Outside of the urban centers, the island of [[Crete]] is known for having regional family-based crime clans involved in the cultivating and trafficking of [[marihuana]] on a domestic as well as an international level. [[Kidnapping]] and [[weapon trafficking]] are activities of choice as well, often collaborating with the [[Albanian mafia]].&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt; An example is the village [[Zoniana]] which is a known ground zero for Cretan drug lords, such as the ''Parasyris family''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://left.gr/news/me-komma-tis-ntoras-eihe-katevei-o-ek-ton-arhigon-tis-mafias-stin-kriti|title=Με το κόμμα της Ντόρας είχε κατέβει ο εκ των αρχηγών της μαφίας στην Κρήτη!  :: left.gr|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Greek organised crime groups are active on the Greek mainland, as well as in other parts of Europe. Activity is mainly focused upon the areas of [[cigarette smuggling]] and the trafficking of [[marihuana]], [[hashish]] and [[weapon trafficking|weapons]]. European cities are deeply affected by Greek organized crime in the form of narcotics smuggling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbeast.gr/world/arthro/480315/oi-mafiozoi-ton-imeron-mas/|title=Newsbeast.gr - ΚΟΣΜΟΣ : Οι μαφιόζοι των ημερών μας|work=newsbeast.gr|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, under pressure from the European union, Greece, and numerous other European countries, have stepped up their war on smuggling, making numerous arrests and otherwise disabling the organizations in collaboration with European law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phantis.com/blogs/ioannis-michaletos/regional-organized-crime-empowered-southeastern-europe|title=Regional organized crime empowered in Southeastern Europe|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2012/06/23/cyprus-five-arrested-for-26-kg-of-cannabis/|title=Cyprus: Five Arrested for 26 kg of Cannabis|author=A.

==In Greece==
With Greece holding a large percentage of the world's maritime merchant shipping, a substantial amount of Greek grown [[marijuana]] is shipped throughout Europe on a yearly basis. Grown on remote farms and fields, mainly on the island of Crete and the Peloponnese peninsula, it has found its way into the heart of most western and middle-European cities, regardless of efforts made to halt this phenomenon. There's a powerful organization in western greece,(amaliada and pyrgos)that also grown high quality of marijuana and shipped to Europe. Under name south cartel or south core the leaders are unknown,but there's a lot of activity in whole greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/marijuana-greek-beach_n_3915756.html|title=1,800-Pound Marijuana Stash Found On Greek Beach In Kyllini, Police Search For Drug Smuggling Gang|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Netherlands==
The Netherlands in particular, with its lenient view of cannabis use, has many dealings with international (and often untraceable) smuggling rings. This is also made possible by the extensive use of maritime merchant ships, and their difficult to regulate and inspect cargo. The "tolerating" laws regarding cannabis, make the selling and usage of marijuana, legal in the Netherlands. However, the cultivation and transportation of cannabis is still illegal. This offers smugglers a strong market with high demand for their product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchamsterdam.nl/686-amsterdam-coffeeshops-organized-crime|title=The connection between Amsterdam's coffeeshops and organized crime - DutchAmsterdam.com|work=Amsterdam Tourist Information|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
it is speculated that for a large part, Greek-based [[cartels]] are at work. However, prosecuting such members is difficult due to the non-hierarchical nature of the organisation(s).

==In North America==
[[North American]] cities with a large Greek community have traditionally also been home to ethnic Greek criminal organizations, well-known ones being the [[Velentzas crime family]] the [[Philadelphia Greek Mob]] and the [[Voidonikolas - Leoutsakos Maniot Canadian crime syndicate families]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/us/philadelphia-s-underworld-war-2-in-greek-mob-fall.html|title=PHILADELPHIA'S UNDERWORLD WAR -  2 IN 'GREEK MOB' FALL - NYTimes.com|date=31 May 1981|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations, have secretly operated for decades, and are notoriously powerful.

==In Africa==
In Africa, A small Greek crime syndicate ran casinos throughout the region of middle Africa, and in the country of South-Africa throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Gambling has always been a staple of the Greeks. Horse racing, cards, casinos and black market dealings. It is safe to assume that Greek-organised crime is difficult to disintegrate, since these groups form, break-up and reform when it suits their interest. For this reason it is often compared to the Italian Camorra, which at times has worked on a similar model. Major differences the Italian Camorra relies mainly on extortion and racketeering, whereas Greek organised crime relies mainly on smuggling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top-channel.tv/english/artikull.php?id=11159&amp;ref=ml|title=Drugs seized in Igumenica. Albanian driver arrested - Top Channel|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries around the world==
Secretive Greek Cypriot crime families are known to operate in Cyprus, The United Kingdom, as well as South Africa. Cypriots, although ethnically Greek, have their own traditions and have always had a strong tradition of organised crime, similar to their brethren on the mainland and the island of Crete.
The Cypriots tend to operate in small family-like cells, with a "father", his "sons" and a few associates. Working with fellow local criminals, which tends to benefit all parties involved, the Greek-Cypriot mafia will accept other nationalities inside their family-like cells. It is difficult to estimate the level of international structure binding them all together. Since they have managed to operate for this long one in high secrecy they are, most likely, informally structured. Cypriot families are very powerful and known to be dangerous {{By whom|date=July 2017}}. There is also a presence of organised crime among Pontic Greeks who, like Cypriots, are ethnically Greek, but have their own traditions. Outside of the Americas and Europe, there is also reportedly a strong Greek organised crime presence in Australia. Greek members of organised crime have always been good at working with other ethnic groups along with their own local Greek groupings, which can at times give them an advantage over other organisations. There was also reportedly a Greek presence in the Chicago mafia, known as the outfit, the number two or three man for years. Depending on various reports it was Gus Alex. The Chicago outfit, unlike the New York family's, has had high ranking associates in positions of real importance and power over the years. Gus Alex was the highest ranking non Italian associate, as he reportedly formed a three-man ruling panel in the late sixties early seventies. The three-man ruling panel, consisting of a Greek and two Italians, ran the Chicago [[outfit]] for an unknown period of time.

[[File:Harry Charles Purvis Bell portrait ~1890.jpg|thumb|HCP Bell, c. 1890.]]
'''Harry Charles Purvis Bell''', [[Ceylon Civil Service|CCS]] (21 September 1851 – 6 September 1937), more often known as HCP Bell, was a British civil servant and the first [[Department of Archaeology (Sri Lanka)|Commissioner of Archaeology]] in Ceylon.

==Early life==
Born in [[British India]] in 1851, he was sent to England for his education. 

==Civil service career==
Without going to university, Bell came to Ceylon as a civil officer in the [[Ceylon Civil Service]] and went on to serve as a [[customs officer]]. He thereafter served as a [[District Courts of Sri Lanka|District Judge]]. 

==Archaeology==
Appointed an official archaeologist, in July 1890 the [[Governors of British Ceylon|Governor of Ceylon]], Sir [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Gordon]], appointed Bell as the first Archaeological Commissioner and Head of the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.gov.lk/history1.html Department of Archaeology - History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; he carried out many excavations in Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]) for the Archaeological Survey during an appointment running from 1890 to 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Robin W. Winks, Alaine M. Low, ''The Oxford History of the British Empire'' (1999), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

After retirement, he also investigated the [[archaeology]] and [[epigraphy]] of the [[Maldives]], where he had been earlier in his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maldivesinfo.gov.mv/info/include/history_early_travellers.php#], [http://www.cpamedia.com/travel/black_magic_in_paradise/]&lt;/ref&gt; and studied the linguistics of the [[Maldivian language]]. Bell had developed a good friendship with the king of the Maldives, who put his own royal [[schooner]] ''Fath-ul-Majid'' at his disposition to carry out archaeological research in certain atolls south of Malé.{{sfn|Romero Frías|2003}}

'''The Heirs of Alexandria''' is an [[alternate history]]/[[historical fantasy]] series set primarily in the [[Republic of Venice]] in the 1530s. The books are written by three authors, [[Mercedes Lackey]], [[Eric Flint]] and [[Dave Freer]]. The books combine elements from the styles of all three authors, such as Lackey's approach to tolerance and magic and Flint's sense of history alteration.

==Plot summary==
In our own universe, [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria was killed for her non-Christian views, shortly before the destruction of the Library by an angry mob. In this universe, Hypatia was converted to Christianity by [[John Chrysostom]], and stopped the mob from destroying the Library. She continued her correspondence with John and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], which eventually led to the modern (1530s) divisions of the Church.

''[[The Shadow of the Lion]]'' (2002) deals with Chernobog's attempt to destroy Venice and the awakening of the city's ancient powers. Marco is the main protagonist, while Chernobog acts through several intermediaries.

''[[This Rough Magic (Heirs of Alexandria)|This Rough Magic]]'' (2003) is set in [[Corfu]] and features several new antagonists. It is largely centered on Maria and Benito's awakening, Marco having fit comfortably in his new role in Venice. [[Elizabeth Bathory|Elizabeth Bartholdy]] has replaced Chernobog as the major behind-the-scenes villain in the book.

''[[A Mankind Witch]]'' (2005) is a solo effort by Freer, and takes place between ''Shadow of the Lion'' and ''This Rough Magic''. While Manfred and Eric are major characters, the focus is shifted to a thrall, Cair Aidin, and the Princess of Telemark, Signy. Trolls are the major antagonists of the story.

''[[Much Fall of Blood]]'' (2010) follows Manfred and Erik after their journey to Jerusalem. While attempting to broker an agreement between the Ilkhan and their nomadic cousins, the Golden Horde, they stumble right into Elizabeth Bartholdy's latest and deadliest plot.

''[[Burdens of the Dead]]'' (2013) centers on Benito Valdosta's attempt to stop Chernobog's plots once and for all thanks after the revelations of ''Much Fall of Blood''. The original working title was ''Great Doom's Shadow''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Great Doom's Shadow |url=http://www.mercedeslackey.com/books/heirs4.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102092507/http://www.mercedeslackey.com/books/heirs4.html |archive-date=November 2, 2010 |publisher=Mercedes Lackey |deadurl=yes |access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
The following characters appear in two or more novels in the series:

* Aldanto, Ceasare: Milanese sell-sword and spy
* [[Elizabeth Báthory|Bartholdy, Elizabeth]]: Hungarian countess and "aunt" to King Emeric. Hundreds of years old but appears to be in her early twenties. Engages in gruesome blood rituals to keep her youth.
* Bespi, Fortunato: former Milanese spy; reprogrammed by the Strega to act as Marco's bodyguard.
* De Chevreuse, Francesca: most powerful Courtesan in Venice, formerly of Orleans
* Dell'Este, Enrico: The Duke of Ferrara; an excellent swordsmith, he is known as the Old Fox, perhaps the craftiest military mind Italy has seen in decades.
* Dorma, Petro: Head of the influential House Dorma, leader of the Lords of the Nightwatch, and a frontrunner for the position of Doge.
* Garavalli, Maria: A sharp-tongued canaler, one of the most feared women in the canals.
* Hakkonsen, Eric: An Icelander, bodyguard and mentor to Manfred
* Hohenstauffen, Charles Fredrik: Holy Roman Emperor
* Evangelina: A member of the Hypatian order in Venice's St. Hypatia di Hagia Sophia.
* Jagiellon: Grand Duke of Lithuania, possessed by the demon [[Chernobog]]
* [[Ignatius of Loyola|Lopez, Eneko]]: A Basque cleric and ecclesiastical magician. He is perhaps the greatest sacred magician since Hypatia herself.
* Prince Manfred of Brittany, Earl of Carnac, Marquis of Rennes, Baron of Ravensburg: Nephew of the Holy Roman Emperor, second in line to the throne.
* Montescue, Katerina (Kat): Heiress to the bankrupt House Montescue. Worked as a smuggler.
* Montescue, Ludovico: Current leader of House Montescue, having wasted most of his money in a pathetic effort to destroy the Valdostas.
* Valdosta, Benito: Grandson of the Duke of Ferrara; a pickpocket while in hiding.
* Valdosta, Marco: Grandson of the Duke of Ferrara; a skilled doctor (when trained) and powerful mage; heir to House Valdosta and the Lion Crown.
* Winged Lion of Venice: The city's ancient guardian, which answers only to the wearer of the Winged Mantle.

==The Church in Europe==

===The Petrines===
Led by the Grand Metropolitan in Rome, the Petrine branch of the Church (named for St. Peter and built on the teachings of Hypatia and Chrysostom) is the creed of choice in Italy and Spain, with a relatively large following in Aquitaine. The Petrines are noted for taking a mediative role in politics and a more tolerant attitude to other faiths.

===The Paulines===
Most of central and northern Europe follow the Pauline creed (named for St. Paul and based on the writings of St. Augustine). The Paulines are recognized for a general intolerance to all non-Christians, though some members of the Church are more politic about it than others. There is no official head of the Pauline church, though the Holy Roman Emperor is the "Bulwark of the Faith". The Paulines very closely (with a few exceptions) resemble historical medieval Catholicism in faith, practice and politics.

==Magic==

===The Church===
Most priests and Sisters of the Petrine branch of the Church are trained as magicians in the Vatican or Alexandria. They are typically trained in scrying, healing, and protection, though a number of them have taken up combative magic. The Order of Hypatia is a dedicated group of Petrine priests and Sisters who use magic to heal and protect.

In the Pauline branch, only the Servants of the Holy Trinity are allowed to use magic (a fact which does not stop the Emperor from seeking a second opinion), and all forms of magic not sanctioned by them is heretical.

===Strega===
The Strega are magic-users and traditional witches who typically serve a higher purpose. In Venice, the Strega are welcomed, and about a third of the students at the Accademia are Strega or have Strega leanings. The Strega are led by a Grand Master, who is usually a ''Grimas'' (one who has mastered all three branches of ''Stregheira'').

===Others===
The darker sides of magic are usually the antagonists of the series. The demon Chernobog, for instance, is the main villain, and his magical minions are the source of Venice's troubles. In ''This Rough Magic'', King Emeric of Hungary is a witch, and a sect of sorceresses are the most powerful antagonists (their leader is the infamous [[Elizabeth Bathory|Elizabeth Bartholdy]]). In ''A Mankind Witch'', it is revealed that female Trolls have powerful magic.

==Nations==
*'''League of Armagh''': a coalition of Celtic and Norse states. Most of their territory lies in the British Isles, however there are extensive settlements in Iceland and Vinland (North America). Manfred of Brittany is the heir to a part of the League as well as the Empire.
*'''Aquitaine''': A realm that encompasses most of our universe's France and England. Francesca de Chevreuse hails from the southern capital, Orleans.
*'''Holy Roman Empire''': ruling over all of central Europe, including Austria, Germany, and Denmark, the Empire is the most powerful nation in Europe, and adheres to the Pauline creed. Manfred of Brittany is an heir to the Empire, currently ruled by Charles Fredrik Hohenstauffen.
*'''Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Poland''': dominating most of eastern Europe, the Duchy is ruled by the iron fist of Grand Duke Jagiellon, who is possessed by the demon Chernobog.
*'''Kingdom of Hungary''': a brutal kingdom which has control of most of the Balkans. The current king, Emeric, is a warmonger who is not above using witchcraft to achieve his bloodthirsty ends.
*'''Ilkhan''': a vast empire implied to be the result of a merger between the Mongols and the Islamic Caliphate. They are known in Europe as the current rulers of Egypt and the Holy Land, enforcing the peace in Jerusalem by aggressively upholding a policy of religious tolerance. The full extent of their empire is not clear, but includes most of the Middle East and extends deep into Asia. 
*'''Genoa''': The only rivals of the Veneze on the open seas, in terms of both trade and navy.
*'''Milan''': The Milanese and the Visconti house are the leaders of the Motagnards, staunch Paulines who are bent on the Empire annexing northern Italy. They are oblivious to the fact that this is the last the thing Empire wants. Caesare Aldanto hails from Milan.
*'''Verona''': Venice's land-based rival.
*'''Ferrara''': Like Venice, the Ferrarese are politically non-aligned, although they have served as agents for both the Empire and the Grand Metropolitan. Duke Enrico Dell'Este, grandfather of Marco and Benito, is known as the Old Fox.

===Venice===
The most trade-oriented and tolerant city in Europe. Venice is in possession of a large empire in the Mediterranean; in addition to its own home territories in Italy, the city also rules Istria on the Adriatic coast, the Greek island of [[Corfu]], [[Crete]], and unnamed territories in Sicily, Sardinia, and North Africa. The city is also known for its policy of tolerance—it is the only city in Europe where all manner of creeds can live together. Jews and Strega are among the persecuted minorities who find safe haven in the city.

The Republic's government is ruled by numerous bodies and individuals:
*The [[Doge]] is elected for a life term from all available candidates in the Senate.
*The Council of Ten are the Doge's cabinet. Membership is a state secret.
*The Lords of the Nightwatch serve as the heads of all "extra-military" matters of the republic, including but not limited to police work, detective work, security and espionage.
*The Senate consists of three hundred dignitaries, merchants, and heads of House.

The '''''hunping''''' ({{zh|c=魂瓶|p=Húnpíng}}), translated as '''soul jar''' or '''soul vase''', is a type of ceramic [[funerary urn]] often found in the tombs of the [[Han dynasty]] and especially the [[Six Dynasties]] periods of early imperial China.&lt;ref name=dien/&gt; It was characteristic of the [[Jiangnan]] region in modern southern [[Jiangsu]] and [[Zhejiang]] provinces.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

The purpose of a ''hunping'' is somewhat enigmatic, but archaeologists suggest that they may have been used as containers for fruit accompanying the deceased into the afterlife.&lt;ref name=dien&gt;{{citation

Since the last decades of the Han Dynasty, the top of ''hunping'' vessels started to be decorated with miniature sculptures of men, animals, birds, etc. Gradually, sculptural compositions became more elaborate, including images of entire buildings.&lt;ref name=dien/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1305">The '''immigrant-host model''' was an approach that developed in postwar [[sociology]] to explain the new patterns of [[immigration]] and [[racism]]. It explained the racism of hosts as a reaction to the different cultural traditions of the immigrants, which acted as obstacles for their [[economic development]] and [[social integration]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J. and J. Lambert (1985). The Sociology of Race. Ormskirk, Causeay.&lt;/ref&gt; The model assumed that the disruption immigration caused to stability would be solved by the cultural assimilation of immigrants into the dominant culture. Since the 1970s, however, the assumptions in this model have been increasingly discarded in the sociology of race relations. The core idea of the model that the immigrants' children would gradually assimilate and, thus, that racism and racial inequality would cease proved false. The model was criticized and blamed for reflecting and, even, reinforcing the racist assumptions by describing the cultures of immigrants as social problems and ignoring the role [[structural inequality]] plays in their subjugation.&lt;ref&gt;Solomoth, J. and L. Back (1993). Race and Racism in Contemporary Britain&lt;/ref&gt;

This article delineates the issue of [[immigration]] in different countries.
{{TOC limit}}

==Region-specific factors for immigration==

=== Europe ===
Citizens of one member nation of the [[European Union]] are allowed to work in other member nations with little to no restriction on movement.&lt;ref name="Eures - Free Movement" /&gt; This is aided by the EURES network, which brings together the [[European Commission]] and the public employment services of the countries belonging to the [[European Economic Area]] and [[Switzerland]]. For non-EU-citizen permanent residents in the EU, movement between EU-member states is considerably more difficult. After 155 new waves of accession to the European Union, earlier members have often introduced measures to restrict participation in "their" labour markets by citizens of the new EU-member states. For instance, [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], Italy, [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], and [[Spain]] each restricted their labor market for up to seven years both in the 2004 and 2007 round of accession.&lt;ref name="migration_information" /&gt;

[[File:Boat People at Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea.jpg|thumb|North African immigrants near the Italian island of [[Sicily]]]]

Due to the European Union's—in principle—single internal labour market policy, countries such as Italy and the [[Republic of Ireland]] that have seen relatively low levels of labour immigration until recently (and which have often sent a significant portion of their population overseas in the past) are now seeing an influx of immigrants from EU countries with lower per capita annual earning rates, triggering nationwide immigration debates.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cicerofoundation"/&gt; Spain, meanwhile, is seeing growing illegal immigration from [[Africa]]. As Spain is the closest EU member nation to Africa—Spain even has two autonomous cities ([[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]) on the African continent, as well as an autonomous community (the [[Canary Islands]]) west of North Africa, in the Atlantic—it is physically easiest for African emigrants to reach. This has led to debate both within Spain and between Spain and other EU members. Spain has asked for border control assistance from other EU states; the latter have responded that Spain has brought the wave of African illegal migrants on itself by granting amnesty to hundreds of thousands of undocumented foreigners.&lt;ref name="BBC: EU nations clash over immigration"/&gt;

The [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Immigration to France|France]], and [[Immigration to Germany|Germany]] have seen major immigration since the end of World War II and have been debating the issue for decades. [[Foreign worker]]s were brought in to those countries to help rebuild after the war, and many stayed. Political debates about immigration typically focus on statistics, the immigration law and policy, and the implementation of existing restrictions.&lt;ref name="Deutsche Welle: Germans Consider U.S. Experience in Immigration Debate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC: Short History of Immigration"/&gt; In some European countries, the debate in the 1990s was focused on asylum seekers, but restrictive policies within the European Union, as well as a reduction in armed conflict in Europe and neighboring regions, have sharply reduced asylum seekers.&lt;ref name="BBC: Analysis: Europe's asylum trends"/&gt;

===Japan===
Some countries, such as [[Japan]], have opted for technological changes to increase profitability (for example, greater [[automation]]), and designed immigration laws specifically to prevent immigrants from coming to, and remaining within, the country.&lt;ref name="Japanese Immigration Policy: Responding to Conflicting Pressures"/&gt; In 2007, minister [[Taro Aso]] described Japan as unique in being "one nation, one civilisation, one language, one culture and one race".&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; In 2013, Japan accepted only six of 3,777 persons who applied for refugee status.&lt;ref name="Osaki 2014" /&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Immigration to the United States}}
In the United States, political debate on immigration has flared repeatedly.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Some on the far-left of the political spectrum attribute anti-immigration rhetoric to an all-"white", under-educated, and parochial minority of the population, ill-educated about the relative advantages of immigration for the US economy and society.&lt;ref name="cmd.princeton.edu"/&gt; On the other hand, those on the far-right think that immigration threatens [[national identity]], as well as cheapening labor and increasing dependence on [[welfare]].&lt;ref name="cmd.princeton.edu"/&gt; The country has seen unprecedented growth of immigrants since its independence in 1776, most recently for those of Asian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-27|title=Asian immigration to the United States|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_immigration_to_the_United_States&amp;oldid=832748525|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration and Western social values==
Many commentators have raised the issue that immigrants from certain cultures who move into [[Western countries]] may not be able to understand and assimilate certain Western concepts, that are relatively alien in some parts of the world, especially related to [[women's rights]], [[domestic violence]], [[LGBT rights]] and the supremacy of [[secular]] laws in front of [[religious]] practices. For instance, in some parts of the world it is legal and socially accepted for men to use physical violence against their wives if they "misbehave"; and wives are expected, both legally and socially, to "obey" their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;In 2010, the United Arab Emirates's Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks.[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/10/19/uae.court.ruling/index.html?_s=PM:WORLD]. In Iraq husbands have a legal right to "punish" their wives. The criminal code states at Paragraph 41 that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right; examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom".{{cite web|url=http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021100954/http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf|archivedate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;in Yemen marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Various behaviours of women, such as  refusing [[arranged marriages]] or having [[premarital sex]], are seen in many parts of the world as justifying violence from family members, particularly parents.&lt;ref&gt;In Jordan, part of article 340 of the Penal Code states that "he who discovers his wife or one of his female relatives committing adultery and kills, wounds, or injures one of them, is exempted from any penalty." Article 98 of the Penal Code is often cited alongside Article 340 in cases of honour killings. "Article 98 stipulates that a reduced sentence is applied to a person who kills another person in a 'fit of fury'".[name="GP"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Altstein, Howard |author2=Simon, Rita James |title=Global perspectives on social issues: marriage and divorce|publisher=''[[Lexington Books]]''|location=Lexington, Mass|year=2003|page=11|isbn=0-7391-0588-4}}] [name="alertnet.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/6f6d5166f24330a0e8edcb79796ca5cc.htm |title= Jordan: Special Report on Honour Killings |accessdate= 2009-02-08}}]

====Israel====
{{Main|Aliyah}}
[[File:Meeting between Sudanese refugees and Israeli students.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Meeting between [[Sudan]]ese [[refugees]] and Israeli students, 2007. In [[Israel]] only [[Jewish]] immigrants automatically acquire [[Israeli citizenship]].]]
[[Jewish]] immigration to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the 19th century was promoted by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] journalist [[Theodor Herzl]] in the late 19th century following the publication of "[[Der Judenstaat]]".&lt;ref name="paperbacks"/&gt; His [[Zionist]] movement sought to encourage [[Aliyah|Jewish migration]], or immigration, to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].  Its proponents regard its aim as [[self-determination]] for the Jewish people.&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt;
The percentage of world Jewry living in the former [[Mandatory Palestine]] has steadily grown from 25,000 since the movement came into existence. Today about 40% of the world's Jews live in Israel, more than in any other country.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary"/&gt;

The Israeli [[Law of Return]], passed in 1950, gives  those born Jews (having a Jewish mother or grandmother), those with Jewish ancestry (having a Jewish father or grandfather) and converts to Judaism (Orthodox, Reform, or Conservative denominations—not secular—though Reform and Conservative conversions must take place outside the state, similar to civil marriages) the right to immigrate to Israel. A 1970 amendment, extended immigration rights to "a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew". Over a million Jews from the former Soviet Union have immigrated to Israel since the 1990s, and large numbers of [[Ethiopian Jews]] were airlifted to the country in [[Operation Moses]]. In the year 1991, Israel helped 14,000 Ethiopian immigrants arrive in operation Solomon.

There were 35,638 African migrants living in Israel in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=227332 Danny Danon: Send African migrants to Australia]".

====Japan====
{{See also|Demographics of Japan}}
[[File:Shibuya night.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Japan]]'s population is very ethnically [[homogeneous]] due to restrictions on immigration.]]
To help cope with a labor shortage, Japan allowed additional immigrants of Japanese ancestry into the country in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; According to Japanese immigration centre,&lt;ref name="xvq"/&gt; the number of foreign residents in Japan has steadily increased, and the number of foreign residents (including [[permanent resident]]s, but excluding [[illegal immigrant]]s and [[tourist|short-term visitors]] such as foreign nationals staying less than 90 days in Japan&lt;ref name="sarkaroffice"/&gt;) was more than 2.2 million in 2008.&lt;ref name="xvq" /&gt; The biggest groups are [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans]] (both south and north), Chinese (including [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] nationalities), and Brazilians. Most of the Brazilians in Japan have [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]] ancestry due to the huge Japanese immigration to Brazil in the first decades of the 20th century. Immediately after [[World War II]], most Koreans in Japan were [[illegal immigrants]] who escaped from civil war on the Korean Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;23 Session of the [[National Diet]], Committee on judicial affairs　[http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/syugiin/023/0488/02312080488003a.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan accepted 8,646 persons as naturalised citizens in 2013, down from 10,622 the previous year.&lt;ref name="moj"/&gt; The definition of "ethnic groups" used in Japanese statistics is different from that used in North American or some Western European statistics. For example, [[the United Kingdom]] Census asks about its citizens' "ethnic or racial background".&lt;ref name="United Kingdom population by ethnic group"/&gt; The Japanese Statistics Bureau does not ask this question. Since the Japanese census asks about nationality rather than ethnicity, naturalised Japanese citizens and Japanese nationals with multi-ethnic backgrounds are considered simply to be [[Japanese people|Japanese]] in the population of Japan.&lt;ref name="xvq" /&gt;

According to the Japanese Association for Refugees, the number of [[refugee]]s who applied to live in Japan has rapidly increased since 2006,&lt;ref name="qvx"/&gt; and there were more than a thousand applications in 2008.&lt;ref name="qvx" /&gt; Japan's refugee policy has been criticised because the number of refugees accepted into Japan is small compared to countries such as [[Sweden]] and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ed20081012a2.html |title=Refugees in Japan |work=Japan Times Online |date=October 12, 2008 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Japan accepted only six of 3,777 persons who applied for refugee status.&lt;ref name="Osaki 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/03/20/national/only-six-asylum-seekers-accepted-by-japan-in-2013#.U_JuFrxdWwE|title=Only six asylum seekers accepted by Japan in 2013|last=Osaki|first=Tomohiro|date=March 20, 2014|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the foreign residents are French or Spanish.

===Europe===
{{Main|Immigration to Europe}}

According to [[Eurostat]], 47.3 million people lived in the EU in 2010, who were born outside their resident country. This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another EU member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million),  Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF 6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128101046/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF |date=January 28, 2012 }}, Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="europa"/&gt;

Some EU member states are currently receiving large-scale immigration: for instance [[Spain]], where the economy has created more than half of all new jobs in the EU over the past five years.&lt;ref name="Article on Spanish Immigration"/&gt; The EU, in 2005, had an overall net gain from international migration of +1.8 million people. This accounts for almost 85% of Europe's total population growth in 2005.&lt;ref name="Europe: Population and Migration in 2005"/&gt; In 2004, total 140,033 people immigrated to [[France]]. Of them, 90,250 were from [[Africa]] and 13,710 from [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Inflow of third-country nationals by country of nationality"/&gt; In 2005, immigration fell slightly to 135,890.&lt;ref name="migrationpolicy"/&gt;
British emigration towards [[Southern Europe]] is of special relevance. Citizens from the European Union make up a growing proportion of immigrants in [[Spain]]. They mainly come from countries like the UK and Germany, but the British case is of special interest due to its magnitude. The British authorities estimate that the British population in Spain at 700,000.&lt;ref name="British Immigrants Swamping Spanish Villages?"/&gt;
Mid- and long term EU demographics indicate a shortage of skilled laborers on a scale that would endanger economic growth and the stability of numerous industries. For this reason the European Union launched an initiative called the EU Blue Card, In 2009. The EU Blue Card is initially a temporary residence and work permit. However it will offer holders the opportunity to apply for a permanent resident permit after working on an EU Blue Card for two to five years uninterrupted, depending on individual member state regulations.

====Italy====
{{Main|Immigration to Italy}}
[[File:Lampedusa noborder 2007-2.jpg|thumb|Immigrants to Europe have entered by boat to the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]]]]
Italy now has an estimated 4 million to 4.5 million immigrants — about 8 percent of the population.
Since the expansion of the European Union, the most recent wave of migration has been from surrounding European nations, particularly Central  Europe, and increasingly Asia, replacing North Africa as the major immigration area. Some 997,000 Romanians are officially registered as living in Italy, replacing Albanians (590,000) and Moroccans (455,000) as the largest ethnic minority group, but independent estimates put the actual number of Romanians at double that figure or perhaps even more. Other immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe are Ukrainians (260,000), Polish (120,000), Moldovans (190 000) Macedonians (100,000), Serbs (75,000), Bulgarians (124,000), Bosnians (40,000), Russians (50,000), Croatians (25,000), Slovaks (12,000), Hungarians (12,000). As of 2009, the foreign born population origin of Italy was subdivided as follows: Europe (53.5%), Africa (22.3%), Asia (15.8%), the Americas (8.1%) and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of foreign born population is largely uneven in Italy: 80% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 20% live in the southern half of the peninsula. In 2008, net immigration to Italy was 47,000.

As the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]] does not base any statistics on [[ethnicity]], there are no exact numbers on the total number of people of immigrant background in Sweden. As of 2010, 1.33 million people or 14.3% of the inhabitants in Sweden were foreign-born. Sweden has been transformed from a nation of [[emigration]] ending after World War I to a nation of immigration from World War II onwards. In 2009, immigration reached its highest level since records began with 102,280 people emigrating to Sweden. In 2010, 32,000 people applied for asylum to Sweden, a 25% increase from 2009, the highest amount in Swedish history.&lt;ref name="www4"/&gt; In 2009, Sweden had the fourth largest number of asylum applications in the [[European Union|EU]] and the largest number per capita after [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]].&lt;ref name="timesofmalta"/&gt;

[[Switzerland]] and [[Australia]] are the two countries with the highest proportion of immigrants in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jacques |last=Neirynck |title=Pour son bien-être, la Suisse doit rester une terre d’immigration |url=http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/b615bb7a-da5a-11e0-ba12-6c1a991db705/Pour_son_bien-%C3%AAtre_la_Suisse_doit_rester_une_terre_dimmigration |work=[[Le Temps]] |location=Geneva, Switzerland |date=9 September 2011 |language=French |accessdate=2014-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141119002114/http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/b615bb7a-da5a-11e0-ba12-6c1a991db705/Pour_son_bien-%C3%AAtre_la_Suisse_doit_rester_une_terre_dimmigration |archivedate=19 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Swiss voters approved [[Swiss referendums, 2010#November|the deportation of criminal foreigners]]&lt;ref name=msgrelp294&gt;{{cite web |title=Votation populaire du 28.11.2010: Votation No 552, Tableau récapitulatif |url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/va/20101128/det552.html |publisher=Chancellerie fédérale Suisse |location=Berne, Switzerland |language=French, German, Italian |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2014, the [[federal popular initiative "against mass immigration"]] was approved by 50.3% of voters.

====United Kingdom====
{{Main|Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922}}
In 2007, net immigration to the UK was 237,000, a rise of 46,000 on 2006.&lt;ref name="UK net immigration up to 237,000"/&gt; In 2004, the number of people who became [[United Kingdom|British]] citizens rose to a record 140,795—a rise of 12% on the previous year. This number had risen dramatically since 2000. In the 2001 Census, citizens from the [[Republic of Ireland]] were the largest foreign born group and have been for the last 200 years.  This figure does not include those from Northern Ireland located since it is part of the United Kingdom.  Those of Irish ancestry number roughly 6 million from first, second and third generation.  The overwhelming majority of new citizens come from [[Asia]] (40%) and [[Africa]] (32%), the largest three groups being people from [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="BBC Thousands in UK citizenship queue"/&gt;

In 2011, an estimated 589,000 migrants arrived to live in the UK for at least a year, most of the migrants were people from Asia (particularly the [[Indian subcontinent]]) and Africa,&lt;ref name="Migration Statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/may-2012/msqr.html|title=Migration Statistics Quarterly Report May 2012 |date=24 May 2012 |work=Office for National Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 338,000 people emigrated from the UK for a year or more.&lt;ref name="Migration Statistics"/&gt; Following [[Poland]]'s entry into the EU in May 2004 it was estimated that by the start of 2007, 375,000 Poles had registered to work in the UK, although the total Polish population in the UK was believed to be 500,000. Many Poles work in seasonal occupations and a large number are likely to move back and forth over time. Some migrants left after the [[Late-2000s recession in Europe#United Kingdom|world economic crisis of 2008]]. In 2011, citizens of the new EU member states made up 13% of the immigrants entering the country.&lt;ref name="Migration Statistics"/&gt; {{As of|2010|5}} the UK Immigration Minister was [[Damian Green]], who has since been replaced by [[Mark Harper]].

After the United States returned to a more closed border, immigration has been more difficult than ever for Mexican residents hoping to migrate. Mexico is the leading country of migrants to the U.S.. A [[Mexican Repatriation]] program was founded by the United States government to encourage people to voluntarily move to Mexico. However, the program was not found successful and many immigrants were deported against their will. In 2010, there was a total of 139,120 legal immigrants who migrated to the United States. This put Mexico as the top country for emigration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immigration to the United States]]&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years China and India have surpassed Mexico as the top sources of immigrants to the United States, and since 2009 there has been a net decline in the number of Mexicans living in the US.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 or McCarran-Walter Act brought in major changes to immigration policy and the act removed the immigration restrictions based on race and gender, ending the decades of repression levied upon Chinese immigrants and other Asian immigrant groups.

The [[Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965]] (the Hart-Cellar Act) removed quotas on large segments of the immigration flow and legal immigration to the U.S. surged. In 2006, the number of immigrants totaled record 37.5 million.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;  After 2000, [[immigration to the United States]] numbered approximately 1,000,000 per year.

Degler, a historian, author of Out of Our Past), a name derived from United States' rich tradition of immigrants coming to the US looking for something better and having their cultures melded and incorporated into the fabric of the country.

Appointed by President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], the [[History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States#1990s|U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform]] recommended in 1997 that legal immigration be reduced to about 550,000 a year.&lt;ref name="google8"/&gt; Since September 11, 2001, the politics of immigration has become an extremely hot issue.

U.S. immigration law distinguishes between "immigrants" who become lawful permanent residents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/tools/glossary/immigrant|title=Immigrant|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "nonimmigrants" who may remain lawfully in the U.S. for years, but who do not obtain permanent resident status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/tools/glossary/nonimmigrant|title=Nonimmigrant|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[World War II]], more [[refugees]] have found homes in the U.S. than any other nation and more than two million [[Immigration to the United States#Asylum for refugees|refugees]] have arrived in the U.S. since 1980.

The table above does not include the years 2011 and 2012. The number of "immigrant" visas available each year is set by Congress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15787">The '''International Federation for Systems Research''' (IFSR) is an international federation for global and local societies in the field of [[systems science]]. This federation is a non-profit, scientific and educational [[non-profit organization|agency]] founded in 1980, and constituted of some forty-five member organizations from various countries.

== Organisation ==
The overall purpose of the [[Federation]] is to advance [[cybernetic]] and [[systems research]] and [[systems applications]] and to serve the international systems community. For this purpose the federation wants to coordinate [[systems research]] among member organizations. They are focused on the organization and sponsorship of research and development, international meetings and workshops in the field. More specific the federation wants to develop and promote international programs and [[publications]] in the area of systems research and applications.

Other tasks include the development and promotion of: 
* Resource materials development in systems education; 
* Standards of competence in systems research and systems education; 
* A [[knowledge base]] in the cybernetic and systems sciences;

For its member organizations the federation seeks coordinating programs and provides assistance to them.

The IFSR was founded on 12 March 1980 by the American [[Society for General Systems Research]] (now ISSS), the [[Austria]]n Society for Cybernetic Studies, and the [[Dutch Systems Group]] with [[George Klir]] as first president of the IFSR.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard Chroust]], [http://ercim-news.ercim.org/content/view/127/275/ ''25 Years of the IFSR: A Milestone in the Systems Sciences''], retrieved 16 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences]] (IASCYS) was founded 2010 by the International Federation for Systems Research.

=== Journal, book series, and newsletter ===
* ''Systems Research and Behavioral Science'' 
The ''IFSR Journal of Systems Research'' was established in 1984 but was merged with the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences]]'s Journal of Behavioural Science  in 1997, forming the [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/%28ISSN%291099-1743a Journal of Systems Research and Behavioural Science].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifsr.org/index.php/journals-systems-research-and-behavioural-science-merge/ Journals: Systems Research and Behavioural Science Merge], IFSR Newsletter 1997 Vol 16. No. 4 December, pp. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The Journal aims to stimulate disciplined inquiry and provides [[transdisciplinary]] focus for the exchange of ideas and knowledge; relating to the analysis, design, development, and management of systems and programs. The journal (ISSN 1092-7026), is edited by [[Michael C. Jackson]] and is published six times a year.

* ''IFSR Newsletter''
The IFSR Newsletter is the informal newsletter of the IFSR (hard copy: ISSN 1818-0809, online: ISSN 1818-0817), published once or twice a year since 1981, edited by Paul F de. P. Hanika (1981–1985), [[Robert Trappl]] (1985), Steven Sokoloff (1986 – 1994), and [[Gerhard Chroust]] (1993–present).&lt;ref name="whatisifsr"&gt;[http://www.ifsr.org/index.php/appendix-what-is-the-ifsr-ifsr-conversations-2012/ Appendix: What is the IFSR? IFSR Conversations 2012], Proceedings of the IFSR Conversation 2012, St. Magdalena, Linz, Austria, 2012, pp. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The newsletter informs member societies about new academic work, updates on fellow member societies and prominent scientists, updates on past systems conferences and plans for future conferences. Back issues of newsletters are available on the IFSR.org web site.

=== IFSR Conversations ===
The Conversations, initially held in [[Fuschl]] near Salzburg, Austria, were established by the IFSR in 1980 and are held biennially. The Conversations convene approximately 30 - 40 systems scientists from around the world to discuss systemic issues and develop understanding relevant for society and its environment. The last IFSR Conversation was held in 2016 in St. Magdalena, [[Linz]], Austria.  Work is currently underway in planning the 2018 IFSR Conversation.

The Conversations were established primarily under the guidance of [[Bela H. Banathy]], as an alternative to traditional conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifsr.org/index.php/16th-ifsr-conversation-2012-systems-and-science-at-crossroads-st-magdalena-april-14-to-19/ 16th IFSR Conversation 2012 “Systems and Science at Crossroads” St. Magdalena April 14 to 19], IFSR Newsletter 2012 Vol. 29 No. 1 September, pp. 14&lt;/ref&gt; A number of systems professionals found that they were disillusioned with a format in which the majority of the time was spent on papers being read or presented to passive listeners, with minimal time for discussion and interaction about the ideas. As described by Bela, they were to be:

* a collectively guided disciplined inquiry,
* an exploration of issues of social/societal significance,
* engaged by scholarly practitioners in self-organized teams,
* on a theme for their conversation selected by participants,
* initiated in the course of a preparation phase that leads to an intensive learning phase.

"Conversations were introduced by [[Bela H. Banathy]] around 1980 as an alternative to the classical conferences which usually consist only of presentation of streamlined papers and short question slots. In a Conversation a small group of systems scientists and practitioners meets for several days to discuss in a self-guided way a topic of scientific and social importance. A Conversations is preceded by an intensive off-line preparation phase (including exchanges of ‘input papers’), followed by the face-to-face discussion at the Conversation and followed by a post-conversation consolidation period. No papers are presented during the conversation, the participants discuss face-to-face their topic, often modifying it in the course of the conversation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifsr.org/index.php/looking-back-at-st-magdalena-2012-ifsr-conversations-2012/ Looking back at St. Magdalena 2012: IFSR Conversations 2012], Proceedings of the IFSR Conversation 2012, St. Magdalena, Linz, Austria, pp. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the conference are published in the Proceedings of the IFSR Conversations. This document publishes the team reports plus several contributed papers. A short description of the IFSR’s activities completes the proceedings. The Proceedings are distributed to member societies and conference attendees. The 2012 Proceedings are available at:  [http://www.ifsr.org/index.php/proceedings-of-the-ifsr-conversation-2012-st-magdalena-linz/ The Proceedings of the IFSR Conversation 2012, St. Magdalena, Linz]. The 2014 Proceedings are available at: [http://www.ifsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IFSR-Conversation-2014-Proceedings.pdf]. The 2016 Proceedings are available through print-on-demand at [https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Literacy-Proceedings-Conversation-Conversations-ebook/dp/B06XHQL7P3 2016 IFSR Conversation Proceedings: Systems Literacy]. Proceedings prior to 2012 are available online in the Archives section of the IFSR website (see http://www.ifsr.org/index.php/publications/conversations/).

The Conversations have led to significant development of a theoretical basis for Systems Engineering, progress in the evolution of Cybernetics to Second Order Science, continuing elucidation of GST* (General Systems Theory), and informing Systems Research (https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789811002625). These developments are described in the IFSR Newsletter [http://www.ifsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NL31_1_opt.pdf].

On April 7, 2010 the General Assembly of the IFSR approved the founding of the [[International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences]] (IASCYS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://iascys.org/ International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences (IASCYS)], IFSR Newsletter 2010 Vol. 27 No. 2 December, pp. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Aims''
IASCYS aims to honor and activate outstanding members of IFSR member-associations. While no one can apply for membership in IASCYS as an individual, every member association of the IFSR can suggest candidates in an official letter supplying  data on the candidate’s scientific and professional achievements in accordance with the criteria of the IASCYS.
* ''Motivations''
IASCYS fills the gap resulting from the failure of national and international academies of sciences and arts to include systems and cybernetics in their list of sciences and arts.
* ''Intentions''
In order to honor the most distinguished systems and cybernetics professionals and simultaneously to promote the systems thinking world view, each year during a ceremonial assembly, a selected academic receives the Bertalanffy/Wiener medal of the Academy.

The officers of the IASCYS Executive Committee are:
:* [[Stuart Umpleby]] – President
:* Ockert Bosch- Vice-President,
:* [[Jifa Gu]] – Vice-president
:* Pierre Bricage – Secretary General

'''Kalagnanam''' is a Sanskrit language word, which means "Knowledge of Times". '[[Prophecy]]' is the exact the meaning of the word .

The Kalagnanam has many authors, who prophesied the future of their times. Most famous among them are Sri Madvirat Pothuluri Veera Brahmendra Swamy and [[Sarvajna|Saint Sarvajna]]. There are also other people who told Kalagnanam like [[Eswaridevi Matam]] (the grand daughter of Veera Brahmendra Swamy), Yogi Subbaraya Sharma, Swami [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]] (also called Vidyaranya, the minister of [[Harihara I]]) and Dudekula Siddaiah (the disciple of Veera Brahmendra Swamy). 

A brief part of Kalagnanam written by Sri Veera Brahmendra Swamy, which was kept in his native place has been published in Telugu language as a book in 1970 for the first time, along with some other prophet's work. A large volume of the predictions made by Veera Brahmendra Swamy are said to be kept under the [[banyan tree]] of [[Banaganapalle]] village of Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. Out of the brief context of Kalagnanam said by Veera Brahmendra Swamy, 320 verses or poems are very popular with name "Govinda Vakyas". 

Another prophet, Saint Sarvajna has prophesied since rule of King Bijjalaraya to emerge of Future Avatar, Veera Bhoga Vasanta Rayalu. His prophecies are in poetic way called 'Dwipada'. 

The whole part of prophecies said by many saints from South India is included in the kalagnanam book which was published by Brahmamgarimatam. The most part of Kalagnanam alias prophecies collection, describes about the coming King-cum-Avatar, Veera Bhoga Vasanta Rayalu and his acts. About 70 percent of prophecies speak of him, while the other part describes the events to be happened mainly in South India.

'''Katuaq''' ({{lang-da|Grønlands Kulturhus}}) is a [[cultural centre]] in [[Nuuk]], [[Greenland]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.katuaq.gl/en/about_katuaq/welcome About Katuaq: Welcome]". Katuaq. Retrieved 2 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for [[concert]]s, [[Art exhibition|exhibition]]s, conferences, and as a [[Film|cinema]]. Designed by [[Schmidt hammer lassen|Schmidt Hammer Lassen]], it was constructed as a joint project of the [[Greenland Home Rule Government]], the Nuuk Municipal Council and the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]] and was inaugurated on 15 February 1997.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.katuaq.gl/en/about_katuaq/the_building About Katuaq: The Building]". Katuaq. Retrieved 2 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
Katuaq is an L-shaped building with an undulating, backward-leaning screen facing onto Nuuk's central urban space. It is raised above the ground and clad in golden [[larch]] wood on both the inside and outside. The screen is inspired by the [[Aurora (astronomy)|northern lights]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mimoa.eu/projects/Greenland/Nuuk/Katuaq%20Culture%20Centre|title=Katuaq Culture Centre|publisher=MIMOA|accessdate=23 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This second skin also creates a contrast to the building proper. Between the perimeter screen and the core building lies the large [[foyer]] with three white freestanding elements in the shape of a triangle, square and circle.

==Facilities==
Katuaq contains two [[auditorium|auditoria]], the larger one seating 1,008 people and the smaller one 508. The big auditorium is used for concerts, theatre, conferences, and as a cinema. Katuaq also provides meeting facilities, administrative offices and a café.

Offices:
* [[The Nordic Institute in Greenland|NAPA - The Nordic Institute in Greenland]] 
* [[Hello Norden]], the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]] information service 

[[Nuuk Center]], the country's first [[shopping mall]], is located right next door.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1044">'''Key Stage 5''' is a label used to describe the two years of education for students aged 16-18, or at [[sixth form]], in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, aligning with previous [[Key Stage]]s as labelled for the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. 

Key Stage 5 is also the stage of education where students go through more intense and challenging courses in very specific subjects like mathematics and physics. This stage is the last stage of secondary education for members of sixth form. When A levels are achieved the students will be able to apply for university.

[[File:Kinora, Fotomuseum Antwerp, Belgium, 2016-07-23, 2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A 1905 Kinora at [[Fotomuseum Antwerp]]]]
The '''Kinora''' was an early [[film|motion picture]] device, developed by the French inventors [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] in 1895, while simultaneously working on the [[Cinematograph]]e. It was patented in February 1896.&lt;ref name=deadmedia/&gt; 

Basically a miniature version of the [[mutoscope]] for home use, the Kinora worked very much like a [[flip book]] in the shape of a [[Rolodex]]. It used conventional monochrome photographic prints fixed to strong, flexible cards attached to a circular core. A reel was revolved handle by turning a handle, making the pictures flip over against a static peg one by one. The moving pictures could be viewed through an eyepiece.&lt;ref name=nmm/&gt;&lt;ref name=ncssm&gt;[http://www.dlt.ncssm.edu/collections/toys/html/exhibit05.htm Kinora] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330234010/http://www.dlt.ncssm.edu/collections/toys/html/exhibit05.htm |date=2012-03-30 }} at dlt.ncssm.edu, accessed 28 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

Originally reels contained printed versions of films by the Lumières, later also films by other companies. 

The Cinematograph proved very successful so the Lumières didn't bother about the Kinora, but passed the idea on to Gaumont who marketed the device and circa 100 different reels around 1900.&lt;ref name=deadmedia/&gt;

The British rights to the Kinora were bought by [[Biograph Company|The British Mutoscope &amp; Biograph Co.]] in 1898, but the machine was not marketed in the UK until 1902.&lt;ref name=nmm&gt;http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/collection/cinematography/viewingprojection/collectionitem?id=1990-5036/2816&lt;/ref&gt; It became popular in the UK and over 12 different viewer models and over 600 reels produced.&lt;ref name=deadmedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/13/138.html|title=Dead medium: the Kinora (on www.deadmedia.org)|last=Herbert|first=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biograph had constructed a studio in London in 1900 to film moving portraits of families and individulas. [[Flip books]] of 60 pictures in standard Mutoscope size were produced there as ''Bio-Gems'', before a Kinora reel portrait service became available in 1903.&lt;ref name=Anthony1996/&gt;

In May 1907 Biograph chairman W.T. Smedley set up Kinora Limited in London. The company introduced the first amateur Kinora camera in 1908,&lt;ref name=Anthony1996&gt;https://books.google.nl/books?id=-Vaith3qNM4C&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=%22Kinora%20Limited%22&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kinora%20Limited%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; using rolls of photographic paper or celluloid one [[inch]] wide that could be sent to the company for processing.&lt;ref name=ncssm/&gt; A Kinora Grand for reels of 1,000 pictures of 2 1/2" by 3" also featured in their advertising booklet.&lt;ref name=Anthony1996/&gt; By 1914, when the company's London factory burned down, public interest in the Kinora had declined, at a time when the cinema screen held greater attractions. The company did not rebuild the lost factory.&lt;ref name=ncssm/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30539">'''La Onda''' (The Wave) was a multidisciplinary artistic movement created in [[Mexico]] by artists and intellectuals as part of the worldwide waves of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and the [[avant-garde]]. Its followers were called "onderos", "macizos" or "[[jipitecas]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garcia|first1=Parmenides|title=En la ruta de la onda|date=1972|publisher=Editoriales Diogenes|location=Mexico|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marroquin|first1=Enrique|title=La contracultura como protesta|date=1975|publisher=Mortiz|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; La Onda encompassed artistic productions in the worlds of [[Cinema of Mexico|cinema]], [[literature]], [[visual arts]] and [[music]] and strongly addressed social issues of the time such as [[women's rights]], [[ecology]], [[spirituality]], [[artistic freedom]], [[Legalization of drugs|open drug use]] and [[democracy]] in a country tightly ruled by the [[PRI (Mexico)|PRI]]. According to Mexican intellectual [[Carlos Monsiváis]], La Onda was "a new spirit, the repudiation of convention and prejudice, the creation of a new morality, the challenging of proper morals, the expansion of consciousness, the systematic revision and critique of the values offered by the West as sacred and perfect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monsiváis|title=Mexico 1967|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== La Onda in music ==

La Onda began with the importation of American and British [[rock and roll]] into the Mexican music culture. Throughout the world, rock and roll was spreading and taking root as "a wedge and a mirror for societies caught in the throes of rapid modernization".&lt;ref name="Refried Elvis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zolov |first=Eric |title=Refried Elvis: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture |year=1999 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California |isbn=978-0-520-21514-6 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eric Zolov, author of Refried Elvis: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture, "rock was a wedge in the sense that it challenged traditional boundaries of propriety, gender relations, social hierarchies, and the very meaning of national identity" which the Mexican PRI (or the Institutional Revolutionary Party) was struggling to define.&lt;ref&gt;Refried, p10&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1950s, "youth from the middle classes began to form their own bands…practicing as best they could versions of hit songs in English by their favorite foreign rock'n'rollers".&lt;ref&gt;Refried, p62&lt;/ref&gt; The youth of Mexico began to identify with the youth of the United States and the United Kingdom, and it was only a matter of time before they were also inspired by the social activism of other modernizing countries.

After the 1968 Mexican student movements ended in the [[Tlatelolco massacre]] in [[Mexico City]], a native [[hippie]] movement known as [[jipitecas]] grew in its wake and expanded to the entire country as well as parts of the USA and Central America. By 1969, a new wave of [[Mexican rock]] music began to emerge, fusing Mexican and foreign music with images of political protest. This movement was called '''La Onda Chicana''', culminating in a two-day "Mexican [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]]" known as ([[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro|Avándaro]]) which attracted ca. 300,000 people in September 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zolov|first=Eric|editor1-first=Deborah Pancini|editor1-last= Hernandez|editor2-first=Héctor D. Fernández|editor2-last= l'Hoeste|editor3-first= Eric|editor3-last= Zolov|title=Rockin' Las Américas: The Global Politics of Rock in Latin/o America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-o51rAMJEUIC&amp;pg=PA38|publisher=U of Pittsburgh P|isbn=9780822972556|pages=22––42|chapter=La Onda Chicana: Mexico's Forgotten Rock Counterculture|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== La Onda in literature ==

Starting in 1965, La Onda made its mark on the "new Central-American novel" and other genres. The wave of popular Mexican novels in the 1960s, "emphasized the sentiments of the new urban middle-class adolescent and the influence of United States culture, [[rock music]], the generation gap, and the [[hippie]] movement."{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  La Onda influenced many Mexican authors and intellectuals, like [[José Agustin]], liberal priest [[Enrique Marroquin]], ecologist Carlos Baca and [[Parménides Garcia Saldaña]].

[[Alberto Blanco (poet)|Alberto Blanco]] and [[Gustavo Sainz]], and they became icons of the movement;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = Modern Latin-American Fiction Writers| encyclopedia = Dictionary of Literary Biography| volume = 145| pages = 185–192| publisher = The Gale Group| location = London| year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers who were not part of the movement but sympathized with it were [[Elena Poniatowska]], [[Gabriela Brimmer]], Jose Emilio Pacheco and [[Octavio Paz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avant-Mier|first1=Roberto|title=Las Ondas de José Agustín: Remembering La Onda through the literature of José Agustín and La Onda roquera (rock’n’roll in México)|journal=Chapter &amp; Verse|date=2005|url=http://www.popmatters.com/chapter/Issue3/mexico.html|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== La Onda in cinema and theater ==

La Onda had icons like [[Alejandro Jodorowski]], the Gurrola bros. and [[Sergio García Michel|Sergio García]], making [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] film  synonymous with counterculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia|first1=Sergio|title=Toward a fourth cinema.|journal=Wide Angle|date=1999|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/wide_angle/v021/21.3garcia_e.html|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iconic films which gained worldwide attention varied from the women's liberation-oriented ones like José Agustin's "[[5 de chocolate y 1 de fresa]]" to Jodorowski's psychedelic avant-garde masterpiece ''[[El Topo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schjedahl|first=Peter|title=Should 'El Topo' Be Elevated To 'El Tops'?|newspaper=New York Times|date=Jun 6, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== La Onda in drug use and spirituality==
In the realm of hallucinogenic drugs, La Onda's icon was shaman [[María Sabina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Estrada|first1=Alvaro|title=Huautla en tiempo de hippies.|date=1996|publisher=Grijalbo|isbn=9700506657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society from the Mexican Revolution to the 1970s==
Mexican society had undergone a tremendous change after the [[Mexican Revolution]]; a period of modernization pushed by the ruling [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] (PRI). Mexican society had a great deal to do with the growth and popularity of the Mexican counterculture. "The country’s transformation from predominantly rural to urban, the expansion of national industries, the emergence of a mixed economy with a high profile, and the expansion of educational institutions all fostered the impression that Mexico had finally emerged from the blight of underdevelopment and was on the road to peace and prosperity".&lt;ref name=Concise&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamnett|first=Brian|title=A Concise History of Mexico|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-61802-9|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRI wanted Mexico to become an evolved and prosperous country, like the United States.

As Mexican society grew more and more inspired by and connected to other foreign countries, the cultural dos and don’ts became more similar to those of other countries - especially those of the United States. As rock and roll music and American television and movies, arrived in Mexico, the youth changed and slowly evolved a rebellious stage inspired by the youth rebellion of the United States. One of the major ways in which the youth of Mexico began to rebel was by listening to and performing rock and roll. At first, they would perform famous songs in English from famous English-speaking rock and rollers like Elvis Presley, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. The Mexican government saw a chance to reach Mexican youth by supporting rock and roll music and helping Mexican musicians to play rock and roll music. The government hoped to change the meaning of the music. Instead of rebellion, the music would inspire support for the Mexican government and promote becoming upstanding citizens. But "government efforts to blockade the arrival of foreign music indirectly contributed to the emergence of a native rock’n’roll product and more and more rock and roll bands began to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Refried, p62&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock and roll represented a connection between the youth of Mexico, and the trend-setting youth of America. Both countries had modernized rapidly after [[World War II]], and an effect of this modernization was a desire for a unifying identity that separate from that of past generations with a Revolutionary identity, and especially from that of their parents and grandparents fought for and brought about the [[Mexican Revolution]]. The harder the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] tried to control the identity of Mexico’s citizens, the more the youth of Mexico felt it necessary to fight back.

Mexican rock and roll bands needed a place to perform their music that was accessible to everyone. They began performing in places like Cafe Cantante, a rock club that allowed everyone to access the counter culture. The youth of Mexico identified with the youth of the United States, but unfortunately were only able to witness a small part of the American counterculture, and that in other countries, so they had to interpret and express what they saw through their music. Besides television, film, and literature, the youth of Mexico only had one true way to experience the counterculture in a unified way, and that was through music. The Cafe Cantantes "thus served as a kind of transcultural performance space where the styles, gestures, and sounds of the youth culture from abroad were transposed for a Mexican audience".&lt;ref&gt;Refried p100&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government felt a need to shut down the clubs because they "foment[ed] rebellion without a cause' leading to increases in juvenile delinquency".&lt;ref name=Arana&gt;{{cite book|last=Arana|first=Frederico|title=Guaraches de ante azul: Historia del rock mexicano vol. 2|year=1985|location=Mexico City, Posada|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the cafes were raided and shut down, the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] grew and was inspired to question and challenge authority.

The counterculture was no longer just about rock and roll. Now, in the early 1960s, youth were also adopting foreign fashion and attitudes towards authority and rock music "was again becoming a wedge against traditional social values and a vehicle for free expression".&lt;ref&gt;Refried, p.102&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government was very focused on projecting cultural unity, and the youth of Mexico felt it was important to express themselves and their feelings about this rigid modernization and unification through their music and clothing.

As the decade went by, hippies, or [[jipiteca]]s, emerged among the youth of Mexico. Politically conscious students began to openly defy societal norms, like the [[hippie]]s did in the United States. They needed to break the bonds of society and find new ways to express themselves. Young men wanted to break out of the mold set by their fathers. So they had to look disheveled and wrinkled, because the older generation of men looked very manicured and put together, and dressed much more conservatively. Girls had a similar problem, but also had to fight for a new freedom, where they had the same rights and opportunities as men. But both genders were beginning to fight for their rights to express themselves, be original, and be individual.

==Politics: Single-party government==
After the Mexican Revolution, the Mexican government worked for a time to legitimize the acts of the new Constitution{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and to settle the country into stabilized governance. For a time, Mexico boasted "high levels of popular participation, featured a wide array of opposing political parties, and observed peaceful transfers of power from one administration to the next".&lt;ref name=Edmonds-Poli&gt;{{cite book|last=Edmonds-Poli|first=Emily, and David A. Shirk|title=Contemporary Mexican Politics|year=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-7425-4049-9|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; But an authoritarian government eventually emerged. "The combination of favorable international circumstances and internal conditions enabled the governing party to become a monopoly party of government during the three decades after 1940".&lt;ref&gt;Concise, p240&lt;/ref&gt; Presidents like [[Álvaro Obregón]], [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], and [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] wanted to perpetuate the teachings of the Revolution and solidify revolutionary ideals into Mexican society. But after the Mexican Revolution the government not only wanted to solidify the Revolution's ideals, it also wanted to improve the government and elevate the status of Mexico to a modern, First World power. In the 1940s they began "to industrialize the country, by means of an import-substitution policy…displacing the traditional center of gravity, which had been the countryside, to the cities".&lt;ref name="Aguilar Camín"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aguilar Camín|first=Héctor, and Lorenzo Meyer|title=In the Shadow of the Mexican Revolution: Contemporary Mexican History, 1910-1989|year=1993|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=0-292-70446-1|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift, and their focus on the middle-class family eventually led to the first phase of La Onda, in which the children and grandchildren of the Revolutionaries began to challenge authority and individualizing and expressing themselves through rock and roll music and foreign fashion trends.

By the 1960s, the import-substitution model was no longer working. The enthusiasm with which the Mexican government had fostering towards economic growth and political stability was slowly stifling the Mexican people. In the 1950s, Northern Mexico witnessed "a vigorous mobilization of peasant groups that invaded lands under the direction of organizations with relatively radical ideologies, outside the official structures".&lt;ref&gt;Aguilar, p184&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1960s, "the monopoly party had deepened its control over the political processes and took credit for the economic expansion that resulted".&lt;ref&gt;Concise, p.241&lt;/ref&gt; Now it was not only Mexico's middle-class youth that were rebelling against the authoritarian government. The working-class was rebelling also, against the old industrial institutions and to fighting for better pay and protection from the companies and the government.

==Economics: A widening gap between the middle and lower classes==
Mexico’s economy expanded substantially after World War II. As it expanded, the country became prosperous and the population more middle class. More and more factories were built, bolstering the economy, but resulting in lower pay for workers ‒ the people who kept the economy afloat. Mexican politics and economy went hand in hand when "political stability [under Ávila Camacho] encouraged enough foreign capital back into the country to bolster high rates of growth".&lt;ref&gt;Concise, p.243&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico’s "emphasis on economic development…has focused on those activities, industry and commerce, that are most efficiently undertaken in urban areas, where there is an adequate supply of labor, credit, transportation, and communication".&lt;ref name=Beezley&gt;{{cite book|last=Beezley|first=William H., and W. Dirk Raat|title=Twentieth-Century Mexico|year=1986|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln and London|isbn=0-8032-3868-1|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on [[urbanization]] eventually led to the worker and student movement of the 1960s.

As 1968 approached, the president of Mexico gained more and more absolute and monopolizing power. President [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] displayed the terrible effects of absolute government on the people of Mexico; "the issue of accountability, along with other constitutional questions such as the relationship of the powers and the effective participation of civil society in the political processes, fell by the wayside".&lt;ref&gt;Concise, p.255&lt;/ref&gt; The monopoly of the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]], especially under Díaz Ordaz, had gone unchallenged prior to the [[Mexico 68|1968 student movement]], but the growth of presidential power under Díaz was seen as blatantly abusive, inspiring students, peasants, and industrial workers to challenge his absolute authority.

In 1968, Mexico City hosted the [[1968 Summer Olympics]]. The Mexican government had been dealing with the effects of La Onda as minor social rebellions inspired by the American counterculture movement. As passive and active resistance grew, the Mexican government saw a need to put down the opposition. Ordaz felt that the Olympics were Mexico’s initiation into the [[First World]] community, and that a student movement just weeks before the Games would be disastrous for Mexico’s image.

Mexico’s economic situation improved in the 1950s with the [[Bracero Program]] and with a "Export-Import Bank approved $150 million loan to finance transportation, agriculture, and power facilities".&lt;ref name=Forman&gt;{{cite web|last=Forman|first=M., M. Martin, and S. Rivera|title=The Mexican Political Economy Since 1945|url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his135/Events/Mexico/Mexico.html|accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1954 and 1971, the Mexican economy stabilized under President [[Adolfo Ruiz Cortines]] and [[Adolfo López Mateos]]. This stability lasted until 1971, when the Mexican economy began to decline. One of the major reasons for such a prosperous economy at this time was Mexico’s decision to nationalize its oil production. This nationalization and Mexico’s modernization program helped to stabilize the economy. Another factor was the Korean War which "had increased world prices, provided opportunities for Mexican exports, and led to the inflow of foreign capital".&lt;ref&gt;Concise&gt;, p248&lt;/ref&gt; But by the late 1960s, the Mexican economy was unable to finance itself, resulting in lower wages and worker discontent.

==Social protests==
Before the Student Movement of 1968, there were other political movements. One such movement took place between 1964 and 1965. At that time, "[[Díaz Ordaz]]’s political miscalculations allowed a dispute over better pay and working conditions with hospital doctors working in the public sector to escalate into a strike movement".&lt;ref&gt;Concise, p257&lt;/ref&gt; Although this strike did not have anything to do with La Onda, it did serve as an example for Mexico’s youth in their fight against an [[authoritarian]] government.

Besides student movements, the government also responded severely to labor unions, usually with harsh repression. In the 1930s and 1940s, the PRI used police and military force to suppress labor protests. Later, in 1958-1959, the government responded to the railway workers’ dispute by arresting numerous workers and union supporters. In 1961, in Mexico City, students gathered to celebrate the newly instated [[Fidel Castro]] administration in Cuba, when the gathering was broken up by police using [[tear gas]] and rifle butts. This severe, single-minded way of dealing with social movements did not work to the Mexican government’s advantage. After the 1968 Student Movement and resulting massacre, "an alliance of students, peasants, and urban workers in [[Oaxaca]] succeeded in forming a political movement independent of the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] by 1972".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the time of Mexico’s economic stability under the PRI, there were many minor protests to question the moral credibility of the Mexican government.

==1968 Student Movement and the Tlatelolco Massacre==
For a long time, the Mexican government had been pushing the Mexican people into a unified structure, one where the youth of Mexico did not rebel and the entire population worked together to recreate Mexico as a First World power. This forced and false unity inspired the Mexican counterculture. The youth of Mexico saw other countries protesting their own false unification, and craved the individuality that those protestors had found. This challenge to authority manifested in the rock and roll music and clothing in the everyday lives of Mexico’s adolescents. And just as the students in other countries peacefully protested conservative governments, the students of Mexico begin to challenge authority in Mexico too. Gilberto Guevara Niebla, a student leader, stated in an interview: "The Student Movement had many dimensions. On one hand, it was a student movement; on the other, it was not. The Student movement was the bearer of demands that were not only strictly student concerns but those of the society. Before 1968, the authoritarian state had brutally beaten workers, also campesinos, and it had destroyed the leftist opposition parties. It was in this vacuum, that students injected their demands, aspirations, and desires that were not exclusively of student interest, but also of interest to campesinos, workers, intellectuals, political parts, etc.".&lt;ref name="Guevara Niebla"&gt;{{cite news|last=Guevara Niebla|first=Gilberto|title=1968: El Fuego de la esperanza|newspaper=Jardón}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1968 student movement was the "articulated restlessness and rage for much of the youth of a middle class which had come of age during Mexico’s acclaimed modernizing 'miracle' and which afterward opened the floodgates of cynicism and everyday resistance to a political system bent on maintaining control".&lt;ref&gt;Refried, page=2&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zolov, the student movement made only six demands, including "freedom of political prisoners, abolition of the riot police, the dismissal of the Mexico City chief of police, and justice against those responsible for repression".&lt;ref&gt;Refried, 121&lt;/ref&gt; The 1968 student movement wasn't just students; peasants, businessmen and Mexico’s working class also took part the fight for democracy. In 1968, the student movement "challenged the legitimacy of the system and proved, by the bloody repression it suffered, that [the Mexican Government] had an authoritarian core".&lt;ref&gt;Aguilar, p165&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters wanted a mass movement that would force the government to reform the official party and provide greater opportunity for political participation.

Economic growth after World War II and the stability that ensued led to overall declines in poverty and inequality, but the "opportunities created for the middle sectors did not match their expectations and instead created a large population of upwardly mobile young people whose dreams and aspirations" grew faster than the Mexican economy.&lt;ref name=Contemporary&gt;{{cite book|last=Edmonds-Poli|first=Emily, and David A. Shirk|title=Contemporary Mexican Politics|year=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-7425-4049-9|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger generation was still inspired by foreign protests against rigid government regimes. Through literature, music, and art, Mexico’s youth connected and amassed into a larger group that included students, peasants and industrial workers. They began to challenge the status quo and question authority, seeking self-expression and equality for all. Across Mexico, more and more universities got involved, students began to meet and address issues and hold rallies protesting world events and injustice in Mexico. As more and more campuses joined in, the government became uncomfortable and paranoid about the effect the students would have on Mexico’s reputation.

It began to monitor politically active students, but the more the government monitored students, the more they joined the cause. By late 1968, even some high schools and middle schools had joined the student movement. No longer was the younger generation fighting against conservative family values with rock and roll music, beatnik literature, and daring fashion. Now, the students were unifying and banding together in resentment of an authoritarian government.

Mexico had been selected to host the 1968 Olympic Games, and the PRI were on high alert for student protests. They were not tolerant. Students played a key role in the democratization of the Mexican government; as police abuse became more and more prevalent, students began to feel that political upheaval was needed. On July 29, 1968, "students barricaded themselves inside their high school to protest police abuse" then "infantry troops used a bazooka to blast" into the school and "proceeded to beat and ultimately arrest one thousand students".&lt;ref name=Trevizo&gt;{{cite book|last=Trevizo|first=Dolores|title=Rural Protest and the Making of Democracy in Mexico, 1968-2000|year=2011|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0-271-03787-5|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and many other cases of police abuse triggered an ultimate student protest on October 2, 1968. Internally, the 1968 student movement was linked to "the growing criticism of the Mexican Revolution that was particularly evident in the labor struggles of the 1950s and 1960s".&lt;ref name=Carey&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=Elaine|title=Plaza of Sacrifices: Gender, Power, and Terror in 1968 Mexico|year=2005|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=0-8263-3544-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political movements of other countries and their success in changing legislation inspired the revolutionary youth. The Mexican youth thought that if they peacefully banded together and showed their support for their cause, the PRI might heed their demands.

On July 26, 1968, demonstrators attempted to gather at the Zócalo&lt;!-- in Mexico DX? --&gt;, which was reserved for organized demonstrations of support for the president. As more and more people gathered, Díaz Ordaz "regarded the movement as an affront to the dignity of Mexico".&lt;ref&gt;Concise, p260&lt;/ref&gt;). The PRI had no control over student demands for respect and constitutional rights. By August 13, 1968, "100,000 people were protesting against the regime’s disrespect for public liberties and the presence of tanks in the city streets".&lt;ref&gt;Concise, p260&lt;/ref&gt; The government saw the growing political unrest as "a revolutionary conspiracy…designed to bring down the existing political order".&lt;ref&gt;Concise, p260&lt;/ref&gt; People gathered on the evening of October 2, 1968, at the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] (Plaza of Three Cultures). The administration made no attempt to establish dialogue. Troops and police opened fire on the Tlatelolco demonstrators and massacred them.

This massacre at Tlatelolco "which effectively terminated the protest movement". There was a call for a new counter-movement and new forms of opposition to the authoritarian government.&lt;ref&gt;Concise, p260&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the student movement had turned into La Onda, a new movement focused solely on expressing a deep need for democracy in Mexico, as well as the need for self-expression.

The massacre "created a legitimacy" for democratization ‒ no longer could the Mexican government deny that Mexico had an authoritarian government.&lt;ref&gt;Trevizo, p57&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did the massacre "reorganize civil society and catalyze electoral reforms", it also "spotlighted Mexican authoritarianism".&lt;ref&gt;Trevizo, p58&lt;/ref&gt; After the Massacre at Tlatelolco, La Onda evolved again. First it had been a protestation of conservative traditions legitimized during the Mexican Revolution. This youth movement questioned authority through the use of rock and roll music, beatnik literature, and daring fashion. Next came the Student Movements that challenged the authoritarian government and fought for the democratization of Mexico. After the Tlatelolco Massacre, a new wave of La Onda emerged ‒ that of the jipitecas, or hippies, who rebelled against the status quo and preached peace and democracy above a strict authoritarianism government.

==Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro==
The [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro|Festival Rock y Ruedas in Avándaro]], Mexico, took place September 11–12, 1971 in the [[hamlet]] of Tenantongo, near the [[Avándaro Golf Club|Avandaro lake and golf club]] in [[Valle de Bravo]], [[State of Mexico]]. The Rock y Ruedas (Rock and Wheels) festival had originally begun as "nothing more than a series of auto races".&lt;ref name="Avándaro"&gt;{{cite web |title=Avándaro: The Day That Music Died--Concert of Rock and Wheels |url=http://www.appalachiangetaways.com/Avandaro%20Mexican%20Woodstock.html |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers suggested that rock music should be included to have a ''Noche Mexicana'' the night before the event. As many bands were hired to participate, a rock festival was organized to promote the auto race ‒ but instead turned into a "Mexican Woodstock" with a huge number of Mexican rock bands such as [[Los Dug Dug's]], El Epilogo, La Division Del Norte, [[Tequila (band)|Tequila]], [[Peace and Love (band)|Peace and Love]], [[El Ritual]] and so many more playing to a crowd of over 300,000 people for two days. This huge music spectacle culminated all the effort of La Onda, describing "a modern sense of movement and communication, as in radio or television 'wavelength'".&lt;ref&gt;Refried, page=113&lt;/ref&gt; The festival, which greatly resembled the Woodstock of the United States, was a culmination of the efforts of La Onda along with the efforts of the government to control political unrest and make the public feel as though their protests were heard. La Onda, which had started as a teenage rebellion against conservative parenting, had turned into a political movement fighting for democracy in an authoritarian government, and lastly returned to a musical demonstration, but instead of violently rebelling against authority, it taught [[passive resistance]], peace, and unification.

The '''Latin American Literary Review/Press''', affiliated with the Department of Comparative Literature in [[Cornell University]],  [[Ithaca]], [[New York (state)|New York]], is a [[non-profit organization]].  The founding [[editor-in-chief]] was Yvette E. Miller.;&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;&lt;ref name=council/&gt;&lt;ref name=asu/&gt; she has been succeeded by Debra A. Castillo.&lt;ref name="Debra A.

Miller developed two entities: the ''Latin American Literary Review'', a [[literary magazine]], and the Latin American Literary Review Press, which published English translations of [[Latin American literature]].&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Latin American Literary Review Press (United States of America)|url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=3989&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|publisher= United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|quote=The goal of the Latin American Literary Review Press has been to make available to the general public translations of Latin American literature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=council&gt;{{cite web|author=Leslie Schwartz|title=Latin American Literature Hits The Big Time|url=http://www.clmp.org/about/newswire_archive_01_05.html|publisher=The Council of Literary Magazines and Press|date=May 15, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asu&gt;{{cite web|author=ASU|title=Latin American Literary Review Press (pp.26-37)|url=http://www.asu.edu/brp/BRP%20catalog%202011%20all%5B1%5D.pdf|publisher=Arizona State University|quote=Latin American Literary Review Press was founded in 1980 to familiarize readers outside of the field with Latin American literature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Latin American Literary Review'' was established in 1972 and is published biannually.  As of 2017 it has moved to an online platform with Ubiquity Press.&lt;ref name="LALRonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larlp.net |title=Latin American Literary Review |date= |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains feature essays, creative work, new translations of important texts, and reviews of recent literary works from [[Latin America]]. It publishes articles in English, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name="LALRblog"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lalronline.wordpress.com |title=Latin American Literary Review |date= |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LALRfacebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Latin-American-Literary-Review-346081595780931/  |title= Latin American Literary Review |date= |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin American Literary Review Press was founded in 1980 and has published creative writing and [[literary criticism]] that has been translated into English. The press was created with the principal objective of familiarizing readers outside the field with Latin American literature.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;&lt;ref name=council/&gt;&lt;ref name=asu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lalrp.org/a_press.html |title=About the press |publisher=Latin American Literary Review Press |date=May 1, 2012|accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Miller's death, the Press has been inactive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25701">This page details the historic development of [[Art conservation]] in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].

==Important dates in the history of art conservation==
Some key dates in the history of conservation in Europe and the United States include:
*1565, Restoration of the [[Sistine Chapel]] frescoes began [53 years after the ceilings were painted].
*1726, First attempt was made to restore Leonardo da Vinci's [[Last Supper]] by Michelangelo Bellotti.
*1729, First recorded transfer had been carried out by Domenico Michelini in Venice for a Titian painting (Ulisse Forni, Manuale del pittore restauratore, 1866, p.&amp;nbsp;106). The profession of restoration becomes more visible in the following years.  In the 18th century, painting restoration became a separate profession in France.
*1735 to 1820, Restoration of paintings in the Spanish royal collections following a 1734 fire.  Hundreds of important paintings were methodically treated in a specially constructed studio; materials used have been documented by Zahira Véliz.  (Zahira Véliz "The Restoration of Paintings in the Spanish Royal Collections, 1734-1820," Studies in the History of Painting Restoration, ed. Christine Sitwell and Sarah Staniforth, Archetype Publications, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–62.)
*1777, 1785, Pietro Edwards, Director of the Restoration of the Public Pictures of Venice and the Rialto, published on basic concepts of preventive conservation, original vices of painters’ materials, respect for the artist’s original intent, and reversibility.
*1794, Charles Willson Peale recorded in his memo book using wax to impregnate paintings.  By the middle of the 19th century, paintings were being wax lined; Rembrandt’s Night Watch was wax-lined in 1851. [Note precedent above with glue; first there was impregnation with an adhesive and some years later, lining.  Analogous to the 20th-century use of PVA/EVA etc.]
*1809, Count Chaptal of Napoleon’s court filed a report regarding pigments used in Pompeii. [Technical analysis of artists’ materials appears and increases in the 19th century.]
*1815, Pigment studies by Sir Humphry Davy (he had a small portable chemical laboratory and 	traveled around Europe, accompanied by Michael Faraday 1813-1815)
*1850, First U.S. Art Restoration Company was formed in New York City – Oliver Brothers Smitsonian Institution, James Oliver account books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/james-oliver-account-books-6971|title=Summary of the James Oliver account books, 1865-1890 - Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|author=Archives of American Art|work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1851, Rembrandt’s ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' is relined with a wax adhesive.
*1852, The cleaning by John Seguier of nine major pictures in the National Gallery, London led to a fierce public outcry and demand for an inquiry.  Cleaning controversies followed in London, Paris, Munich, (in the US by 1978, and about the Sistine 	Chapel by 1985).  (Cleaning controversies had also erupted re. policies at the Louvre in 1793.)
*1850-1853, Michael Faraday carried out analytical and deterioration studies for the National Gallery, London, investigated varnishes, cleaning methods and the impact of London fog, coal smoke, and 	gas lighting on the discoloration of surface coatings.  His findings were generally ignored.
*1860s, [[Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration|Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration and Conservation]] has expanded and opened a location in Boston. 	
*1863, Max Pettenkofer of Munich patented a method to “reverse the aging of varnish” through exposure to ethanol vapors; this method was later found to increase the interactive zone between paintings and varnish, complicating future cleanings [Ref. Sibylle Schmitt, IIC 1990].
*1870s, Louis Pasteur carried out analytical studies of paint and optical crystallography for over a decade.
*1888, [[Friedrich Rathgen]] became chemist in charge of the Royal Museums of Berlin (Staatliche Museen), first museum laboratory
*1896, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] discovered x-rays in 1895 and x-rayed a painting the next year.  He called them  “X-rays”, using the mathematical designation for something unknown.
*1920, [[British Museum]] Research Laboratory established under the direction of Alexander Scott as a direct response to the poor state of the museum’s collections.
*1920s, George T. Oliver of Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration, Boston&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oliverbrothersonline.com|title=Art Restoration and Conservation - Oliver Brothers|work=Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration}}&lt;/ref&gt; has invented world’s first vacuum table for re-lining paintings.

*1928, Questionnaire initiated by the German museum council in 1928 on how much to clean, how much to inpaint [Berlin was a leading international art center at this time].  German activities at an international level ended when the National Socialists assumed power in 1933; art experts who emigrated (e.g. Max J. Friedländer, Ernst Gombrich, [[Julius S. Held]], Johannes Hell, Helmut Ruhemann, William Suhr, etc.) influenced attitudes in U.K. and U.S.
*1930, The first “International Conference for the Study of Scientific Methods for the Examination and Preservation of Works of Art” held in Rome, 13-17, October.

The '''Miskolc Opera Festival''' or '''International Opera Festival of Miskolc''' ''(Miskolci Nemzetközi Operafesztivál)'' is a cultural event held every summer in [[Miskolc]], the capital of [[Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén]] county, [[Hungary]]. The event offers a selection of [[opera]] performances with the participations of famous artists from all over the world and was created by [[Péter Müller Sziámi]], the former art director of the [[National Theatre of Miskolc]] in 2001.

The main venue is the [[National Theatre of Miskolc]], the current building dating from 1847. The main auditorium (capacity 687), the summer theatre (500) and chamber theatre (270) are used for stage works. Concerts also take place in the Ice Hall (winter sports hall), the House of the Arts and churches such as the Protestant Church, Kossuth u, as well as in public squares.

It is also called "Bartók + ... Opera Festival", because each year the festival focuses on the works of [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] plus another composer or composers. There are chamber recitals alongside the operatic performances as well as events for children and films.

Some productions are from visiting companies; in 2009 Moscow [[Helikon Opera]], Szeged National Theatre and Latvian National Opera were among these.

In 2017 the festival marked the half millennium of the reformation with productions of ''Scaevola'' (world premiere) by Mátyássy Szabolcs, an opera-musical ''The Master and Margarita'' by [[Levente Gyöngyösi]], ''[[María de Buenos Aires]]'' by Piazzolla, ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' by Bernstein, ''Jr. Butterfly'' by [[Shigeaki Saegusa]], as well as ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'' and ''[[The Spinning Room]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, Malcolm. Report from Miskolc Festival. ''[[Opera (magazine)|Opera]]'', September 2107, Vol.68 No.9, p1165-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

During festival time [[MVK Rt.]] operates a veteran tram which stops outside the theatre, where [[Trams in Miskolc|regular trams]] do not stop, and is free for festival patrons with tickets.

Since 2001, festivals have had as their theme; 
* 2001: Bartók + [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]];
* 2002: Bartók + [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]];
* 2003: Bartók + [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]];
* 2004: Bartók + [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]];
* 2005: Bartók + [[Bel canto]] ([[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]);
* 2006: Bartók + [[Verismo]];
* 2007: Bartók + [[French opera|Paris]];
* 2008: Bartók + Slav composers;
* 2009: Bartók + Vienna; covered Gluck (''[[Le cadi dupé]]''), Haydn (''[[La canterina]]'', ''[[L'infedeltà delusa]]''), Mozart (''[[Apollo et Hyacinthus]]'', ''[[L'oca del Cairo]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', ''[[The Magic Flute]]''), Strauss (''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]''), Berg (''[[Wozzeck]]'', ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]''), Schoenberg (''[[Moses und Aron]]'');
* 2010: Bartók + Europe;
* 2011: Bartók + [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]];
* 2012: Bartók + Puccini; themes are rotated from now on

==Classical Rock shows==
In 2007 the festival contained a concert of the Swedish symphonic metal band [[Therion (band)|Therion]] with a complete symphonic orchestra and choir, the second such performance of them ever. The show included a full orchestral version of their song "Clavicula Nox", and  music by [[Antonín Dvořák]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. The second part of the show featured  the band's assorted songs, in which classical instruments and choir have a significant role.

After the great success of this concert, the tradition of rock-classical events was established under the name "Opera-Rock-Show". For the 2008 festival the Dutch band [[Epica (band)|Epica]] was invited to play. As Therion a year before, they also played their own songs in addition to classical pieces by many classical composers including Vivaldi, Dvořák, Verdi, Grieg, plus soundtracks of the movies ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]''.

The 2010 Festival featured two concerts: one of by the Hungarian rock band [[Republic (band)|Republic]] and the other by [[Tarja Turunen]], who was originally scheduled for 2009, but due to organisatory problems it was postponed. The shows have been seemingly discontinued in the following years, there were neither plans, no rumours about more acts.

Both Therion's and Epica's performances were released as a live album in 2009 by [[Nuclear Blast Records]]. While Epica issued only a double CD with the name ''[[The Classical Conspiracy]]'', Therion also had DVD recordings called ''[[The Miskolc Experience]]''.

Geographically, the '''Old South''' is a subregion farming country of the [[Southern United States|American South]], differentiated from the [[Deep South]] by being limited to those Southern laws, states represented among the [[Thirteen Colonies|original thirteen British colonies]] which became the first thirteen [[U.S. states]]. Culturally, "Old South" is used to describe the rural, agriculturally-based, pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] economy and society in the [[Southern United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/United-States/277512/209440-toc|title=United States - Old South to New South|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the post-war [[New South]].

==Cultural usage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
The story of the "Old South" is the story of slavery's plantations, its origins, its expansion, and its pervasive influence on the region.  Pre-Civil War Americans regarded Southerners as a distinct people, who possessed their own values and ways of life. During the three decades before the Civil War, popular writers created a stereotype, now known as the plantation legend, that described the South as a land of aristocratic planters, beautiful southern belles, poor white trash, faithful household slaves, and superstitious fieldhands. This image of the South as "a land of cotton where old times are not forgotten" received its most popular expression in 1859 in a song called "Dixie," written by a Northerner named Dan D. Emmett to enliven shows given by a troupe of [[blackface]]d minstrels on the New York stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&amp;psid=3557|title=Digital History|website=www.digitalhistory.uh.edu|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Old South" also refers to the tradition of Southerners voting the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] ticket, though more often "the [[Solid South]]" is used to describe this. During the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, black people exercising their right to vote for the first time led to a Republican South until 1877, when southern Democrats returned to power due to intimidation of black voters and laws that suppressed civil rights.   As more middle class and educated Republicans move to the South from other areas of the country and white support for segregation and racist policies subsided, the south began to shift to the Republican party starting with Nixon winning a few southern states in 1968.  The modern Democratic Party's views on abortion, taxes, gun rights, and other issues escalated the shift in recent decades.

==Geographic usage==

The [[Southern Colonies]] were [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

The "Old South" is usually defined in opposition to the [[Deep South]], which also includes [[Alabama]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Mississippi]], and it is also further differentiated from the inland [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]], including the [[Upper South]] states of [[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]], as well peripheral southern states of [[Florida]] and [[Texas]].

==Old South Day==
Since 1976, the city of [[Ochlocknee, Georgia]] has celebrated Old South Day every year.&lt;ref name="wctvannualoldsouthday"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Turner |first1=Alicia |title=Annual 'Old South Day' in Ochlocknee |url=http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Old-South-Day-In-Ochlocknee--347211062.html |accessdate=June 2, 2018 |work=WCTV |date=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open form''' is a term coined by [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] in 1915 to describe a characteristic of [[Baroque painting|Baroque art]] opposed to the "closed form" of the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] {{harv|Wölfflin|1915|loc=chapter 3}}. Wölfflin tentatively offered several alternative pairs of terms, in particular "a-tectonic" and "tectonic" (also free/strict and irregular/regular), but settled on open/closed because, despite their undesirable ambiguity, they make a better distinction between the two styles precisely because of their generality. In an open form, which is characteristic of 17th-century painting, the style "everywhere points out beyond itself and purposely looks limitless", in contrast to the self-contained entity of a closed form, in which everything is "pointing everywhere back to itself" {{harv|Wölfflin|1950|loc=124}}. In general, the closed compositions of the 16th century are dominated by the vertical and horizontal, and by the opposition of these two dimensions. Seventeenth-century painters, by contrast, de-emphasize these oppositions so that, even when they are present, they lose their tectonic force. The diagonal, on the other hand, becomes the main device used to negate or obscure the rectangularity of the picture space {{harv|Wölfflin|1950|loc=125–26}}.

Although the term first occurred only in this book, the foundations for this concept had already been articulated by Wölfflin in 1888, in his earlier book ''Renaissance und Barock'' {{harv|Kaletha|2004|loc=121, n79}}. The closed/open pairing was one of five pairs of opposed categories to contrast the differences between the two periods. The others were the [[Line art|linear]] and the [[Painterliness|painterly]], [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] and [[Perspective (visual)|depth]], multiplicity and unity, and clearness and unclearness {{harv|Podro|2010}}.

The concept was soon adopted in other fields. Although in Wölfflin's opinion architecture could only be tectonic and therefore "closed" {{harv|Wölfflin|1950|loc=149}}, the notion of openness found its way into the theory of architecture by 1932, when [[Helmuth Plessner]] gave a lecture on [[Modern architecture|modernist architecture]] in Germany to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] {{harv|Plessner|[1932] 2001}}. 

The essentially dynamic character of the [[Film|film medium]] was seen as an essentially open form, in contrast to the closed form of selected "[[Film still|stills]]" from the same film, which could be appreciated for their pictorial composition {{harv|Read|1945|loc=142}}.

In fiction, a '''plot hole''', '''plothole''' or '''plot error''' is a gap or inconsistency in a storyline that goes against the flow of logic established by the story's plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/plot_hole|title=plot hole {{!}} Definition of plot hole in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such inconsistencies include such things as illogical or impossible events,&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/movies-plot-holes-wrong/&lt;/ref&gt; and statements or events that contradict earlier events in the storyline. The term is more loosely also applied to "loose ends" in a plot – side-lined story elements that remain unresolved by the end of the plot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13546">'''Quantum coin flipping''' uses the principles of [[quantum mechanics]] to encrypt messages for secure communication.  Unlike in other types of [[quantum cryptography]], quantum coin flipping is a protocol used between two users who do not trust each other.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography"&gt;Stuart Mason Dambort, [https://phys.org/news/2014-05-tails-experimental-quantum-coin-flipping.html "Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography performs better than classical protocols"], ''Phys.org'', March 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Since the players do not trust each other, they both want to win the coin toss and, thus, they will try to cheat in various ways.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;

Quantum coin flipping and other types of quantum cryptography communicate information through the transmission of [[qubits]]. The accepting player does not know the information in the qubit until he performs a measurement.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Quantum Coin-Tossing"&gt;C. Döscher and M. Keyl, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0206088.pdf "An Introduction to Quantum Coin-Tossing"], ''Cornell University Library'', February 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The security of quantum cryptography is in the qubits. In each of the qubits, information is carried by a single [[photon]].&lt;ref name= "Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography"&gt;Vivek R and Dr. J. Roopchand, [http://www.ijcta.com/documents/volumes/vol3issue4/ijcta2012030417.pdf “Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography – A Survey"], ''International Journal of Computer Technology and Applications'', August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Once the receiving player measures the photon, it is altered and will not measure the same way again.&lt;ref name="Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography" /&gt; The fact that a photon can only be read the same way once allows for an easy detection of any other party attempting to intercept the message.&lt;ref name="Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography" /&gt;

Quantum coin flipping is a secure means of communicating in theory, but difficult to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography" /&gt;

==History==
Manuel Blum introduced coin flipping as part of a classical system in 1983.&lt;ref name="A New Protocol and Lower Bounds for Quantum Coin Flipping"&gt;Andris Ambainis, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0204022.pdf "A New Protocol and Lower Bounds for Quantum Coin Flipping"], ''Cornell University Library'', April 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Blum’s coin flipping protocol was based on computational algorithms and assumptions.&lt;ref name="A New Protocol and Lower Bounds for Quantum Coin Flipping" /&gt; Blum’s version of coin flipping answers the cryptographic problem in the example:

:Alice and Bob are recently divorced, living in two separate cities, and want to decide who gets to keep the car. To decide, Alice wants to flip a coin over the telephone. However, Bob is concerned that if he were to tell Alice heads, she would flip the coin and automatically tell him that he lost.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Quantum Coin-Tossing" /&gt;

Thus, the problems with Alice and Bob are that they do not trust each other, the only resource they have is the telephone communication channel, and there is not a third party available to read the coin.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Quantum Coin-Tossing" /&gt; The only way that Alice and Bob can exchange information is if they are both being truthful and agree on a value or until one of them is convinced that the other is cheating.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Quantum Coin-Tossing" /&gt;

In 1984, [[quantum cryptography]] emerged in the paper written by Charles H. Bennett and Giles Brassard. In this paper, the two introduced the idea of using quantum mechanics to enhance previous cryptographic protocols such as coin flipping.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt; Since 1984, many researchers have applied quantum mechanics to cryptography as they have proven theoretically to be more secure than classical cryptography.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt; However, demonstrating these protocols, like quantum coin flipping, in practical systems has been difficult to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;

As published in 2014, a group of scientists at the Laboratory for Communication and Processing of Information (LTCI) in Paris have implemented quantum coin flipping protocols experimentally.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt; The researchers have reported that the protocol performs better than a classical system over a suitable distance for a metropolitan area optical network.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;

==Coin flipping protocol==
Quantum coin flipping is when random qubits are generated between two players that do not trust each other because both of them want to win the coin toss, which could lead them to cheat in a variety of ways.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt; The essence of coin flipping occurs when the two players issue a sequence of instructions over a communication channel that then eventually results in an output.&lt;ref name="Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography" /&gt;

A basic quantum coin flipping protocol involves two people: Alice and Bob.&lt;ref name="Experimental Plug and Play Quantum Coin Flipping"&gt;Anna Pappa et al., [http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4717 "Experimental Plug and Play Quantum Coin Flipping"], ''Nature Communications'', April 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Alice sends Bob a set number of Κ photon pulses in the quantum states | Φ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;. Each of these photon pulses is independently prepared following a random choice by Alice of basis α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and bit c&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''i'' = 1, 2, 3…Κ. 
# Bob then measures the pulses from Alice by identifying a random basis β&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Bob records these photons and then reports back the first successfully measured photon ''j'' to Alice along with a random bit ''b''. 
# Alice reveals the basis and bit that she used at the basis Bob gave her. If the two bases and bits match, then both parties are truthful and can exchange information. If the bit reported by Bob is different than that of Alice’s, one is not being truthful.

[[File:Quantum Coin Flipping Protocol.png|thumb|Alice decides her random basis and sequence of qubits. She then sends the qubits as photons to Bob via the quantum channel. Bob detects these qubits and records his results in a table. Based on the table, Bob makes his guess to Alice on what basis she used.]]

A more general explanation of the above protocol is as follows:&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing"&gt;Charles H. Bennett and Giles Brassard, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397514004241?np=y&amp;npKey=9d7c391743e27ff2d85b36896983c21b907525570b2ae94fadb8c09ad21600ca "Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing"], ''Theoretical Computer Science'', December 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
# Alice first chooses a random basis (such as diagonally) and a sequence of random qubits. Alice then encodes her chosen qubits as a sequence of photons following the chosen basis. She then sends these qubits as a train of polarized photons to Bob through the communication channel.
# Bob chooses a sequence of reading bases randomly for each individual photon. He then reads the photons and records the results in two tables. One table is of the rectilinear (horizontal or vertical) received photons and one of the diagonally received photons. Bob may have holes in his tables due to losses in his detectors or in the transmission channels. Based on this table, Bob makes a guess as to which basis Alice used and announces his guess to Alice. If he guessed correctly, he wins and if not, he loses.
# Alice reports whether he won or not by announcing what basis she used to Bob. Alice then confirms the information by sending Bob her entire original qubit sequence that she used in step 1.
# Bob compares Alice’s sequence with his tables to confirm that no cheating occurred on Alice’s part. The tables should correspond to Alice’s basis and there should be no correlation with the other table.

===Cheating===
The key issue with coin flipping is that it occurs between two distrustful parties.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt; These two parties are communicating through the communication channel some distance from each other and they have to agree on a winner or loser with each having a 50 percent chance of winning.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt; However, since they are distrustful of one another, cheating is likely to occur. Cheating can occur in a number of ways such as claiming they lost some of the message when they do not like the result or increasing the average number of photons contained in each of the pulses.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;

For Bob to cheat, he would have to be able to guess Alice’s basis with a probability greater than ½.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt; In order to accomplish this, Bob would have to be able to determine a train of photons randomly polarized in one basis from a train of photons polarized in another basis.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt;

Alice, on the other hand, could cheat in a couple of different ways, but she has to be careful because Bob could easily detect them as cheating.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt; When Bob sends a correct guess to Alice, she could convince Bob that her photons are actually polarized the opposite of Bob’s correct guess.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt; Alice could also send Bob a different original sequence than she actually used in order to beat Bob.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt;

===Detecting a third-party===
Single photons are used to pass the information from one player to the other (qubits).&lt;ref name="Emerging Trends in Quantum Cryptography" /&gt; In this protocol, the information is encoded in the single photons with polarization directions of 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees, non-orthogonal quantum states.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt; When a third party attempts to read or gain information on the transmission, they alter the photon’s polarization in a random way that is likely detected by the two players because it does not match the pattern exchanged between the two legitimate users.&lt;ref name="Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing" /&gt;

==Implementation==
===Experimental===
As mentioned in the history section, scientists at the LTCI in Paris have experimentally carried out a quantum coin flipping protocol, giving an example of using quantum coin flipping. Previous protocols called for a single photon source or an entangled source to be secure. However, these sources are why it is difficult for quantum coin flipping to be implemented. Instead the researchers at LTCI used the effects of [[quantum superposition]] rather than a single photon source, which they claim makes implementation easier with the standard photon sources available.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;

These researchers used the Clavis2 platform developed by IdQuantique for their protocol. The researchers had to modify the Clavis2 system to get it to work for the coin flipping protocol. The experimental setup they used with the Clavis2 system, involves a two-way approach. Light pulsed at 1550&amp;nbsp;nanometres is sent from Bob to Alice. Alice then uses a phase modulator to encrypt the information. After encryption, she then uses a Faraday mirror to reflect and attenuate the pulses at her chosen level and sends them back to Bob. Using two high quality single photon detectors, Bob chooses a measurement basis in his phase modulator to detect the pulses from Alice.&lt;ref name="Experimental Plug and Play Quantum Coin Flipping" /&gt;

They replaced the detectors on Bob’s side because of the low detection efficiencies of the previous detectors. When they replaced the detectors, they were able to show a quantum advantage on a channel for over {{convert|15|km|mi}}. A couple of other challenges the group faced was reprogramming the system because photon source attenuation was high and performing system analyses to identify losses and errors in system components. With these corrections, the scientists were capable of implementing a coin flipping protocol by introducing a small honest abort probability, the probability that two honest participants cannot obtain a coin flip at the end of the protocol, but at a short communication distance.&lt;ref name="Heads or tails: Experimental quantum coin flipping cryptography" /&gt;

:''This article is for the sound-on-film technology. For the telecommunication device invented by Alexander Graham Bell and Charles Sumner Tainter, see [[Photophone]].''

'''RCA Photophone''' was the trade name given to one of four major competing technologies that emerged in the American film industry in the late 1920s for [[sound-on-film|synchronizing electrically recorded audio to a motion picture image]]. RCA Photophone was an [[optical sound]], "variable-area" [[film]] [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] system, in which the [[modulation|modulated]] area (width) corresponded to the [[waveform]] of the [[sound|audio]] signal. The three other major technologies were the [[Warner Bros.]] [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] system, as well as two "variable-density" [[sound-on-film]] systems, [[Lee De Forest]]'s [[Phonofilm]], and [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]]-[[Theodore Case|Case]]'s [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]].

When [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] and other investors merged [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO) with the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] theater chain and [[Radio Corporation of America]], the resulting movie studio [[RKO Radio Pictures]] used RCA Photophone as their primary sound system. In May 1929, RKO released ''[[Syncopation (1929 film)|Syncopation]]'', the first film made in RCA Photophone.

== History and licensing ==
In the early years following [[World War I]], [[Charles A. Hoxie]] working at [[General Electric]] (GE) developed a photographic film recorder, initially to record transoceanic wireless telegraphy signals. However, this recorder was later adapted for recording speech and was used in 1921 to record speeches by President Coolidge and others which were broadcast over Station WGY (Schenectady). This recorder was called the ''[[Pallophotophone]]''.

In 1925 GE started a program to develop commercial sound-on-film equipment based on Hoxie's work. Unlike the [[Phonofilm]] and [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] systems in which the audio modulated the intensity of a recording lamp which exposed the soundtrack, thus creating a variable-density track, the GE system employed a fast-acting mirror [[galvanometer]] to create a variable-area soundtrack. A number of demonstrations of this system, now known as Photophone, were given in 1926 and 1927. The first public screenings with this system were of a sound version (music plus sound effects only) of the silent film [[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]] which was exhibited as a road-show in around a dozen specially equipped theatres during 1927.&lt;ref&gt;History of Sound Motion Pictures, E.W. Kellog, Journal of the SMPTE Vol 64 June 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 RCA Photophone Inc was created as a subsidiary of RCA (itself then a GE subsidiary) to commercially exploit the Photophone system. The RCA system continued to use the ''galvanometer'' until the 1970s, when it became technically obsolete. The Western Electric system continued to use the ''light valve'', and, under successor ownership, is still used to this day.

For nearly half a century, motion picture sound systems were licensed, with two major licensors in North America, RCA and Western Electric (Northern Electric, in Canada), which licensed their principal sound element (original track negative) recording systems on a non-exclusive basis. In general, motion picture producers elected to license one or the other. In a few cases, where mergers had occurred, a producer might be licensed for both. For many years, it was customary to "brand" a film with its sound system, variously as "RCA Sound Recording", "Western Electric Recording", or similar brands, often including the corporate logo of the licensor (''Meatball'' for RCA; ''The Voice of Action'' for Western Electric; ''Li Westrex'' for the post-1956 divestiture of Western Electric under Litton Industries' ownership). Such branding ceased in about 1976, particularly after nearly all optical sound recording (for release prints) had been converted to Westrex's stereo variable-area system from RCA's and Westrex's mono systems, although there were a few examples of such branding thereafter (mainly Westrex.)

Many years later, the Photophone trademark would be reused by the Western Electric/Westrex stereo variable-area system, after both the Western Electric and Westrex trademarks became unavailable due to corporate asset sales by the disintegrating Bell System, but the Western Electric/Westrex stereo variable-area system continued to be marketed by a successor, and it is still serviced and supported to this day, although it is no longer branded as Photophone.

== Comparison of (mono) variable-area and variable-density ==

Although variable-density sound system recording is usually associated with Western Electric and variable-area sound system recording is usually associated with RCA, these relationships are not cast into stone.

Both variable-area systems and variable-density systems were marketed by both RCA and Western Electric, the Western Electric ''light valve'' being capable of producing either variable-density or variable-area depending on which ribbon axis was parallel to the film motion, and the RCA ''galvanometer'' was capable of producing either variable-area or variable-density depending upon the particulars of the optical system.&lt;ref&gt;Indeed, the RCA-licensed Maurer recorder could produce either variable-area or variable-density by simply shifting a portion of the optical system at the recordist's discretion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly equal measured and perceived quality was available from both systems and from both manufacturers. Neither recording system nor manufacturer was clearly superior to the other, except where specific customer end-to-end processes made one system/manufacturer more consistently superior to the other system/manufacturer.

Variable-density was preferred for Technicolor sound prints as this process utilized a silver gray-scale "key" record, thereby creating a [[CMYK]] color image, and the [[sound track]] was also a silver gray-scale record, which greatly facilitated variable-density (and made variable-area rather difficult). The "key" record was deleted from most [[Technicolor#Three-strip Technicolor|Technicolor]] prints after 1944, thereby creating a CMY color image, but Technicolor's strong preference for variable-density continued long thereafter.

Variable-density was finally abandoned as customer preferences for "dual-bilateral" variable-area sound tracks emerged in the late 1950s. This required changes to some laboratory processing and quality controls, but the real reason for variable-density's demise was yet to come.

== Stereo variable-area ==
In the early-1970s there was renewed interest in improving the quality of optical film soundtracks. 

As a consequence by the early 1970s several individuals and organizations were considering improvements to the dated technical standards used for optical sound on 35mm film. In particular both Dolby Labs&lt;ref&gt;The Production of Wide-Range, Low-Distortion Optical Soundtracks Utilizing the Dolby Noise Reduction System. Ioan Allen. JSMPTE Vol.84 Sept 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and Kodak&lt;ref&gt;Stereophonic Photographic Soundtracks. Ronald E. Uhlig. JSMPTE Vol.82 April 1973&lt;/ref&gt; were investigating the use of Dolby noise reduction on optical soundtracks. 

In the mid-1970s Westrex Corp. (a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Litton Industries]] since 1956, and the successor to Western Electric's cinema sound business unit) re-introduced the ca. 1938 "four ribbon" light valve, and the ca. 1947 RA-1231 sound recorder.&lt;ref&gt;J. Frayne and H. Wolfe, ''Sound Recording'' (New York: [[Wiley &amp; Sons]], 1949). Discusses, in the abstract, the components of that which later became today's Photophone (né Western Electric/Westrex) stereo variable-area system, but the component descriptions are spread throughout this essential and definitive text&lt;/ref&gt;

When originally introduced in 1947 the RA-1231 could be configured as a mono 35mm variable-density or variable-area recorder, or a mono 16mm variable-density or variable-area recorder, at the customer's option. However its basic electro-optical arrangement could also be used to create a time-aligned, two-channel variable-area version,&lt;ref&gt;Two, three or four time-aligned tracks were theoretically possible, and one implementation did, indeed, offer four time-aligned discrete tracks. The four-track experiment was not repeated. All subsequent implementations were two discrete, time-aligned tracks.&lt;/ref&gt; and this then became the industry standard device for recording stereo variable-area optical soundtracks.

Variable-density's fate was then sealed as these stereo optical sound prints (as contrasted with stereo magnetic sound prints or mono optical sound prints) became a marketing imperative.

When encoded utilizing [[Dolby Laboratories]]'s technology (itself originally being in part licensed from [[Sansui Electric|Sansui]]), the discrete L and R channels of Westrex's stereo variable-area system were renamed "Left Total" and "Right Total", and when decoded utilizing Dolby's Cinema Processor these produced the L, C, R and S sound image first popularized by Fox's [[Cinemascope|CinemaScope]] magnetic stereo system in 1953.

Stereo optical sound prints are compatible with films with any aspect ratio and with normal print film stocks with [[Film_perforations#KS|KS-type]] film perforations, whereas stereo magnetic sound prints require film stocks with the narrower [[Film_perforations#CS|CS-type]] film perforations. Film with [[Film_perforations#CS|CS-type]] perforations can only be run on a projector fitted with special narrow-toothed sprockets or permanent damage will be done to the film. An alternative is LaVezzi's [[Film_perforations#VKF|VKF]] ("Very Kind to Film") sprockets, which perform optimally on KS- as well as CS-perforated prints. Stereo variable-area, therefore, provided for the first time stereo film prints of ''any'' aspect ratio (1.37:1/Academy through 2.35:1/CinemaScope, inclusive) which could be run without damage on any normal 35mm cinema projector.

Nearly all original track negatives (OTNs) are now produced as stereo variable-area, and the former Western Electric (Westrex) system has been renamed Photophone and has become the de facto standard for analogue optical soundtracks, world-wide.

The fully implemented case of stereo variable-area (i.e., 4-2-4 encoding/decoding) produces a stereo 3.1 track.

The partially degenerate case of stereo variable-area (i.e., no 4-2-4 encoding/decoding, but discrete left total/left and right total/right) produces a stereo 2.0 track.

The fully degenerate case of stereo variable-area (i.e., no 4-2-4 encoding/decoding, and left total/left equal to right total/right) produces a conventional "dual-bilateral" mono 1.0 track.

== RCA Photophone system abandoned – Westrex (stereo) variable-area system renamed Photophone ==
Once the ability to record stereo tracks became a commercial imperative for sound-transfer facilities the RCA system was abandoned as it was incapable of producing time-aligned stereo sound negatives, whereas the Western Electric/Westrex recorders with the ca. 1938 4-ribbon light valve (RA-1231, e.g., but ''not'' RA-1231A) were inherently capable of producing time-aligned sound negatives.

The Westrex system was renamed Photophone after the Western Electric and Westrex registered trademarks were sold by [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] and [[Litton Industries]], respectively, to others, for uses other than cinema sound systems.

Renaming the Westrex system to Photophone was facilitated by the demise of RCA's cinema sound business unit, by the hand of [[General Electric]], RCA's acquirer, and by its failure to protect the Photophone trademark.

The Westrex system, briefly renamed Photophone, is still in use, with more than 100 systems currently in active service, world-wide. Some users, including [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and Warner Bros., have multiple systems. The RCA system is essentially defunct.

The Westrex system also has the capability of producing a DTS time-code track along with its native stereo variable-area tracks, or DTS time-code alone for use with 70mm and "special venue" prints.

== Photophone brand abandoned ==

The re-use of the Photophone brand was relatively short-lived. After the closure of the immediate successor to Litton, the RA-1231 recorder and its supporting electronics were taken over by yet another successor.

'''Russell Crowe's jockstrap''' is a leather [[jockstrap]] It was part of a costume worn by actor [[Russell Crowe]] in the 2005 film ''[[Cinderella Man]]''. In 2018, the jockstrap had been auctioned off and was bought by comedian [[John Oliver]] who in turn donated it to the last operating [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Video]] stores in [[Alaska]]. 

== Original use and subsequent ownership ==
In ''Cinderella Man'', Australian actor [[Russell Crowe]] played American boxer [[James J. Braddock]], who was the [[List of lineal boxing world champions#Heavyweight|world heavyweight]] champion from 1935 to 1937. In the film, Crowe wears the jockstrap in the scene in which Braddock wins the championship.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://people.com/movies/russell-crowe-jock-strap-divorce-auction/#|title=Russell Crowe's Used Leather Jock Strap Fetches $7K as 'Divorce Auction' Rakes in $3.7 Million|last=Quinn|first=Dave|date=April 7, 2018|work=PEOPLE|access-date=November 23, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the film was produced, Crowe took possession of various props from the film, including the jockstrap, and incorporated them into his collection of memorabilia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Sale and Blockbuster Video donation ==
In April 2018, Crowe auctioned off over 200 props he owned that were used by him in his various films in an "divorce auction" to celebrate his split from [[Danielle Spencer (Australian actress)|Danielle Spencer]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a19691547/russell-crowe-jockstrap-cinderella-man-divorce-auction/|title=Russell Crowe's Jockstrap From 'Cinderella Man' Is For Sale, in Case You're Interested|last=Mancuso|first=Vinnie|date=April 5, 2018|work=Men's Health|access-date=November 28, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He included the jockstrap as part of the auction as "a piece of whimsy and a bit of a gag"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After the announcement of the auction, ''Bloomberg'' listed the jockstrap as one of the most bizarre items for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-05/the-most-bizarre-items-in-russell-crowe-s-divorce-auction|title=The Most Bizarre Items in Russell Crowe’s Divorce Auction|last=Tarmy|first=James|date=April 6, 2018|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jockstrap sold for $7,000 ($8.450 with Buyer's Premium), more than ten times the estimated price of $500 to $600,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which also led to a flurry of coverage on this high sales price.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/925930/russell-crowe-s-leather-jock-strap-sells-for-7k-at-art-of-divorce-auction|title=Russell Crowe's Jock Strap Sells for $7,000 at Divorce Auction|last=Swertlow|first=Meg|date=April 7, 2018|newspaper=E!

The '''STARSHINE''' (Student Tracked Atmospheric Research Satellite Heuristic International Networking Experiment) series of three artificial [[satellite]]s were student participatory missions sponsored by the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL).

==Satellite description==
[[File:Starshine4 5 300.jpg|thumb|125px|left|STARSHINE Logo]]

STARSHINE-1 was a spherical satellite that was fitted with almost nine hundred small mirrors polished by students from around the world. Once launched, a network of over 20,000 students from eighteen countries tracked the satellite by observing sunlight glinting off the mirrors and networked their observations via the Internet. The students used these observations to calculate air drag, solar activity, and other orbit related properties of the satellite.&lt;ref&gt;

STARSHINE-2 and -3 had systems added to impart spin to these satellites in an effort to improve the solar-reflected flash rate, as well as a number of laser [[retroreflector]]s to introduce the students to [[satellite laser ranging]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/ | title = International Laser Ranging Service | publisher = NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The satellites were constructed largely from spare flight hardware.

In November 2001, the amateur radio payload on STARSHINE-3 was designated STARSHINE-OSCAR-43, or SO-43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Launches==
[[Image:STS-108 STARSHINE 2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|STARSHINE 2 is deployed from the payload bay of ''Endeavour'' during [[STS-108]]]]
The STARSHINE launches were considered launches of opportunity; STARSHINE-1 was launched June 5, 1999 from the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] on [[STS-96]], STARSHINE-3 launched on September 29, 2001 as part of the ''Kodiak Star'' [[Athena I]] mission, and STARSHINE-2 launched December 5, 2001 from the Space Shuttle [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']] on [[STS-108]].

==Reentry==
Starshine 3 reached a fiery end in the Earth's upper atmosphere on January 21, 2003. It had made 7434 revolutions around the Earth since its launch.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[Indo-European studies]], the '''salmon problem''' or '''salmon argument'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Adams |first=Douglas Q. |date=1985 |title=PIE *lokso-, (anadromous) brown trout’ and *kokso- ‘groin’ and their descendants in Tocharian: A coda to the Lachsargument. |location=Berlin |journal=[[Indogermanische Forschungen]] |issue=90 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |pages=72–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known by the [[German language|German]] term '''''Lachsargument'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Schrader |first=Otto |date=1883 |title=Sprachvergleichung und Urgeschichte.

Linguistic-historical contributions to the investigation of Indo-European antiquity. |publisher=Costenoble |location=Jena |edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an outdated argument in favour of placing the Indo-European [[urheimat]] in the [[Baltic region]], as opposed to the [[Eurasian Steppe]], based on the [[cognate]] etymology of the respective words for [[salmon]] in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Balto-Slavic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |ref=harv |last=Diebold |first=A. Richard |article=Contributions to the Indo-European salmon problem |editor-last=Christie |editor-first=William M |title=Current proceedings in historical linguistics. |conference=2nd International Conference on Historical Linguistics, Tucson, 12–16 January 1976 |pages=341–387 |date=1976 |location=Amsterdam |publisher=[[Elsevier#Imprints|North-Holland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasoning went as follows: Since the term for [[Atlantic salmon]] in the Germanic, Baltic and Slavic languages could be derived from a common [[Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*laḱs'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Miller |first=Gary D. |date=2007 |title=Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans |url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/drjdg/historical/pubs/IE.pdf |publisher=[[University of Florida]] |access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the urheimat of the Indo-Europeans must be where both the languages and the object it describes can be found: Northern-Central Europe. The argument was first put forward by German philologist [[Otto Schrader (philologist)|Otto Schrader]] in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Giacalone Ramat |first1=Anna |last2=Ramat |first2=Paolo |date=1998 |title=The Indo-European Languages |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-06449-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument was subject to continued scholarly debate throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in German academia.

In 1953, German indologist [[Paul Thieme]] submitted that the descendants of ''laḱs-'' found in the Caucasus described the [[trout]] (''Salmo trutta'') rather than the Atlantic salmon (''Salmo salar'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Thieme |first=Paul |date=1953 |title=Die Heimat der indogermanischen Gemeinsprache |trans-title=The homeland of the common Indo-European language |journal=Abhandlungen der geistes- und sozialwissenschaftlichen Klasse |publisher=Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Wiesbaden |location=Mainz |issue=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American philologist [[George Sherman Lane]] concurred in a 1970 conference paper: "In my opinion, the name in question probably did refer originally not to the ''[[Salmo salar]]'' at all, but rather to the ''[[Salmo trutta ciscaucasicus|Salmo trutta caspius]]'' of the northwest Caucasus region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |ref=harv |last=Lane |first=George Sherman |article=Tocharian.

'''Sauri''' is a [[Papuan language]] of the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Papua (province)|Papua]], on the eastern shore of [[Cenderawasih Bay]].

Sauri is lexically similar to the [[East Geelvink Bay languages]] and presumably belongs in that family, but is too poorly attested to be sure.

'''Sexual violence''' is any [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]] or attempt to obtain a sexual act by [[violence]] or [[coercion]], acts to [[Human trafficking|traffic]] a person or acts directed against a person's [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], regardless of the relationship to the victim.&lt;ref name="WHO definition"&gt;World Health Organization., World report on violence and health (Geneva: [[World Health Organization]], 2002), Chapter 6, pp. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icc-cpi.int"&gt;[Elements of Crimes, Article 7(1)(g)-6 Crimes against humanity of sexual violence, elements 1.

Sexual violence is a serious public health problem and has a profound short or long-term impact on physical and mental health, such as an increased risk of sexual and [[Reproduction|reproductive]] health problems,&lt;ref&gt;Holmes MM et al. Rape-related pregnancy: estimates and descriptive characteristics from a national sample of women. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 1996, 175:320–324.&lt;/ref&gt; an increased risk of [[suicide]] or [[HIV]] infection. [[Murder]] occurring either during a [[sexual assault]] or as a result of an [[honor killing]] in response to a sexual assault is also a factor of sexual violence. Though women and girls suffer disproportionately from these aspects,&lt;ref name="icrc.org"/&gt; sexual violence can occur to anybody at any age; it is an act of violence that can be perpetrated by parents, caregivers, acquaintances and strangers, as well as intimate partners. It is rarely a [[crime of passion]], and is rather an aggressive act that frequently aims to express power and dominance over the victim.

Sexual violence remains highly stigmatized in all settings, thus levels of disclosure of the assault vary between regions. In general, it is a widely underreported phenomenon, thus available data tend to underestimate the true scale of the problem. In addition, sexual violence is also a neglected area of research, thus deeper understanding of the issue is imperative in order to promote a coordinated movement against it. [[Domestic violence|Domestic sexual violence]] is distinguished from conflict-related sexual violence.&lt;ref name="Human Security Report 2012"&gt;[Human Security Report (2012), Sexual Violence, Education and War: Beyond the mainstream narrative, Human Security Research Group, Simon Fraser University, Canada, Human Security Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Often, people who coerce their spouses into sexual acts believe their actions are legitimate because they are married. In times of conflict, sexual violence tends to be an inevitable repercussion of warfare trapped in an ongoing cycle of impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=International Committee of the Red Cross|title=Women and War|year=2008|publisher=ICRC|location=Geneva|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|OCHA|2007|pp=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape of women and of men is often used as a method of warfare ([[war rape]]), as a form of attack on the enemy, typifying the conquest and degradation of its women or men or captured male or female fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Swiss S et al. Violence against women during the Liberian civil conflict. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1998, 279:625–629.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if strongly prohibited by [[Human rights law|IHRL]], [[Custom (law)|Customary law]] and [[International humanitarian law|IHL]], enforcement mechanisms are still fragile or even non-existent in many corners of the world.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2001 57–61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icrc.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Physicians for Human Rights 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Physicians for Human Rights|title=War-related sexual violence in Sierra Leone : a population-based assessment : a report|year=2002|publisher=Physicians for Human Rights|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1-879707-37-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 2007"&gt;{{harvp|OCHA|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From a historical perspective, sexual violence was considered as only happening to women and as being commonplace and "normal" during both war and peace times from the Ancient Greeks to the 20th century. This led to the negligence of any indications of what the methods, aims and magnitude of such violence was. It took until the end of the 20th century for sexual violence to no longer be considered a minor issue and to gradually become criminalized.

== Definitions ==

===General===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in its 2002 World Report on Violence and Health defined sexual violence as: "any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person's sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to home and work".&lt;ref name="WHO definition"/&gt; WHO's definition of sexual violence includes but is not limited to rape, which is defined as physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the [[vulva]] or [[Human anus|anus]], using a [[Human penis|penis]], other body parts or an object. Sexual violence consists in a purposeful action of which the intention is often to inflict severe humiliation on the victim(s) and diminish human dignity. In the case where others are forced to watch acts of sexual violence, such acts aim at intimidating the larger community.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Other acts incorporated in sexual violence are various forms of [[sexual assault]]s, such as forced contact between mouth and penis, vulva or anus.&lt;ref name="WHO 2002 pp. 147-181"&gt;[WHO (2002), ’Sexual violence’, in World Report in violence and health, Chapter 6, pp. 147-181]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence can include coerced contact between the mouth and penis, vulva or anus, or acts that do not involve physical contact between the victim and the perpetrator—for example, sexual harassment, threats, and peeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-factsheet.pdf|title=Understanding Sexual Violence|last=|first=|date=2014|website=www.cdc.gov/|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coercion, with regard to sexual violence, can cover a whole spectrum of degrees of force. Apart from physical force, it may involve [[psychological intimidation]], [[blackmail]] or other threats – for instance, the threat of physical harm, of being dismissed from a job or of not obtaining a job that is sought. It may also occur when the person being attacked is unable to give consent – for instance, while drunk, drugged, asleep or mentally incapable of understanding the situation.

Such broader definitions of sexual violence are found within international law. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] (ICC) has established in article 7(1)(g) that "rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity".&lt;ref&gt;[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Article 7(g) Crimes against humanity]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence is further explained in the ICC's Elements of Crimes, which the Court uses in its interpretation and application of Article 7. The Elements of Crime establishes that sexual violence is:

*"An act of sexual nature against one or more persons or caused such person or persons to engage in an act of sexual nature by force, or by threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or abuse of power, against such person or persons or another person, or by taking advantage of a coercive environment or such person’s or persons’ incapacity to give genuine consent."&lt;ref name="icc-cpi.int"/&gt;

The Special Rapporteur on systemic rape sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflict, in a report in 1998, stipulated that sexual violence is "any violence, physical or psychological, carried out through sexual means by targeting sexuality". This definition encompasses physical as well as psychological attacks aimed at "a person's sexual characteristics, such as forcing a person to strip naked in public, mutilating a person’s genitals, or slicing off a woman’s breasts".&lt;ref name="McDougall 1998"/&gt; The Special Rapporteur’s definition also refers to situations "in which two victims are forced to perform sexual acts on one another or to harm one another in a sexual manner".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvp|McDougall|1998|loc=para. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A thorough definition is necessary in monitoring the prevalence of sexual violence and studying trends over time. In addition, a consistent definition helps in determining the magnitude of sexual violence and aids in comparing the problem across demographics. Consistency allows researchers to measure risk and protective factors for victimization in a uniform manner. This ultimately informs prevention and intervention efforts.

=== Conflict-related and domestic sexual violence ===
A distinction is made between conflict-related sexual violence and domestic sexual violence:&lt;ref name="Human Security Report 2012"/&gt;

* ''Conflict-related sexual violence'' is sexual violence perpetrated by combatants, including rebels, militias, and government forces. The various forms of sexual violence can be used systematically in conflicts "to torture, injure, extract information, degrade, threaten, intimidate or punish".&lt;ref&gt;[Goetz, Ms. Anne Marie (2008), ’Introduction’ at Wilton Park Conference, Women Targeted or Affected by Armed Conflict: What Role for Military Peacekeepers?, 27–28 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence can in such cases amount to being a weapon of war. See [[War rape]].
* ''Domestic sexual violence'' is sexual violence perpetrated by intimate partners and by other family/household members, and is often termed ''intimate partner violence.'' This kind of sexual violence is widespread both during conflict and in peacetime. It is commonly believed that incidences of domestic sexual violence increase in wartime and in post-conflict environments.

== Victims ==

===Spectrum===
A spectrum of people can fall victim to sexual violence. This includes women, men and children, but also people who define themselves in other terms, e. g. [[transgender]] individuals.

Most research, reports and studies focus on sexual violence against women and sexual violence in armed conflicts. Mainstream narratives on sexual violence also often depict men as perpetrators and women as victims. Indeed, women suffer disproportionately from sexual violence; however, sexual violence is committed by both men and women, and in peacetime as well as during conflict.&lt;ref name="Sivakumaran, Sandesh 2007 pp. 253-276"&gt;[Sivakumaran, Sandesh (2007), ”Sexual Violence Against Men in Armed Conflict” in European Journal of International Law, Vol. 18, no.2, pp. 253-276]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for individuals to be targeted based on sexual orientation or gender-exhibiting behavior. Such attacks, which are often called "[[corrective rape]]s" have been performed to conform an individual to a heterosexual orientation or to more accepted notions of behavior for the perceived gender of the victim.

=== Domestic sexual violence ===
{{main|Sexual violence by intimate partners}}

Domestic sexual violence includes all forms of unwanted sexual activity. It is considered abuse even if the victim may have previously engaged in consensual sexual activities with the perpetrator. Men and women can both fall victim to this type of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. and Segal, J. (2013). Domestic Violence and Abuse: Signs of Abuse and Abusive Relationships. HelpGuide.  Available at:{{cite web |url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/domestic_violence_abuse_types_signs_causes_effects.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201131946/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/domestic_violence_abuse_types_signs_causes_effects.htm |archivedate=2013-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 WHO study on physical and sexual domestic violence against women conducted across ten countries, finds that prevalence of sexual domestic violence ranges on average between 10 and 50%. Domestic sexual violence is also considerably less common than other forms of domestic violence. The variations in the findings across and within countries suggest that this type of abuse is not inevitable and can be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C., Jansen, H. A., Ellsberg, M., Heise, L., &amp; Watts, C. H. (2006). Prevalence of intimate partner violence: findings from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence. The Lancet, 368(9543), 1260-1269.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
Sexual violence against women and girls can take many forms and is carried out in different situations and contexts. The WHO’s World Report on Violence and Health&lt;ref name="WHO 2002 pp. 147-181"/&gt; lists the following ways in which sexual violence against females can be committed: 
* Systematic rape during armed conflict
* Rape within marriage or dating relationships
* Rape by strangers
* Unwanted sexual advances or sexual harassment, including demanding sex in return for favors
* Sexual abuse of mentally or physically disabled people
* Sexual abuse of children
* [[Forced marriage]] or cohabitation, including the [[Child marriage|marriage of children]]
* Denial of the right to use contraception or to adopt other measures to protect against sexually transmitted diseases
* [[Forced abortion]]
* Violent acts against the sexual integrity of women, including [[female genital mutilation]] and obligatory inspection for [[virginity]]
* Forced [[prostitution]] and [[Human trafficking|trafficking of people]] for the purpose of sexual exploitation

There was a study in 1987 that came to a conclusion that women in college have reported being involved in unwanted sex due to men using verbal coercion, physical force, and using alcohol an drugs to intoxicate them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking of Sexuality|last=Moore|first=Nelwyn|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|year=2010|isbn=|location=198 Madison Avenue, New York , New York 10016|pages=524|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual violence is one of the most common and widespread violations to which women are subject in wartime. It also figures among the most traumatic experiences, both emotionally and psychologically, women suffer during conflict. Sexual violence, in particular rape, is often considered as a method of warfare: it is used not only to "torture, injure, extract information, degrade, displace, intimidate, punish or simply destroy," but also as a strategy to destabilize communities and demoralize men.&lt;ref&gt;[ICRC (2008), Women and War, pp. 12-13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas, Katie 2007 pp. 15-16"&gt;[Thomas, Katie (2007), “Sexual violence: weapon of war” in Forced Migration Review, Issue 27, January, pp. 15-16]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of sexual violence as a weapon of war was widespread conflicts such as Rwanda, Sudan, Sierra Leone, and Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Thomas, Katie 2007 pp. 15-16" /&gt;
The perpetrators of female-directed violence in times of conflict are often armed groups and local people.&lt;ref&gt;[Egeland, Jan (2007), “International responses” in Forced Migration Review, Issue 27, January, pp. 8-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Men ===
As with sexual violence against women, sexual violence against men can take different forms, and occur in any kind of context, including at home or in the workplace, in prisons and police custody, and during war and in the military.&lt;ref name="WHO 2002 pp. 147-181"/&gt; The practice of sexually assaulting males is not confined to any geographical area of the world or its place of commission, and occurs irrespective of the victim’s age.&lt;ref name="Sivakumaran, Sandesh 2007 pp. 253-276"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solangon 2012 pp. 417-442"&gt;[Solangon, Sarah and Preeti Patel (2012), “Sexual violence against men in countries affected by armed conflict” in Conflict, Security and Development, 12:4, pp. 417-442]&lt;/ref&gt; The various forms of sexual violence directed against males include rape, enforced sterilization, enforced masturbation, and genital violence. Sexual violence against males also encompasses emasculation, which can take place through "[[Feminization (sociology)|feminization]]" or "homosexualization" of the victim, and the prevention of procreation.&lt;ref name="Sivakumaran, Sandesh 2007 pp. 253-276"/&gt;

Male-directed sexual violence is more significant than is often thought. The scope of such crimes continues, however, to be unknown largely because of poor or a lack of documentation. The under- or non-reporting of sexual violence against males may often be due to fear, confusion, guilt, shame and stigma, or a combination thereof.&lt;ref&gt;[Russell, Wynne (2007), ”Sexual violence against men and boys” in Forced Migration Review, Issue 27, pp. 22-23]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Sivakuraman, Sandesh (2005), “Male/Male Rape and the ‘Taint’ of Homosexuality” in Human Rights Quarterly, Volume 27, Number 4, November 2005, pp. 1274-1306]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, men may be reluctant to talk about being victim of crimes of sexual violence. In this regard, the way in which societies construct the notion of masculinity plays a role. Masculinity and victimization may be considered incompatible, in particular in societies where masculinity is equated with the ability to exert power, leading to non-reporting.&lt;ref&gt;[Stanko, Elizabeth A. and Kathy Hobdell (1993), “Assault on Men: Masculinity and Male Victimization” in British Journal of Criminology, 33(3), pp. 400-415]&lt;/ref&gt; The incompatibility between the conventional understanding of masculinity and victimization can arise both with regard to the attack itself and when coping with the consequences of such crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[Mezey, Gillian C. and Michael B. King (2000), “Treatment for Male Victims of Sexual Assault” in G. Mezey and M. B. King (eds.) Male Victims of Sexual Assault]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of under- and non-reporting on sexual violence against men, the little evidence that exists tends to be anecdotal.&lt;ref name="Solangon 2012 pp. 417-442"/&gt;

In the case that sexual violence against males is recognized and reported, it is often categorized as "abuse" or "torture". This is considered a tendency to hide sexual assaults directed at men as something else, and it is believed to contribute to the poor- or lack of reporting of such crimes, and can arise from the belief that sexual violence is a women's issue and that men cannot be victims of sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="Sivakumaran, Sandesh 2007 pp. 253-276"/&gt;

=== Children ===
{{main|Child sexual abuse}}
Sexual violence against children is a form of [[child abuse]]. It includes harassment and rape, as well as the use of children in prostitution or pornography.&lt;ref name="ReferenceUNICEF"&gt;UNICEF(2011)Child protection from violence, exploitation and abuse - Sexual violence against children. Available at: http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58006.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (1996). Declaration of the Stockholm Convention. Pg. 1. Available at: http://www.csecworldcongress.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual violence is a serious infringement upon a child's rights, and one which can result in significant physical and psychological trauma to the victim.&lt;ref name="ReferenceUNICEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceOHCHR"&gt;OHCHR (2010). Addressing sexual violence against children. Available at: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/HRCChildren.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 WHO study approximated that 223 million children have been victims to sexual violence involving physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;Global Estimates of Health Consequences due to Violence against Children at note 8, based on estimates by G. Andrews et al., Child sexual abuse, chapter 23 in M. Ezzati et al., (2004) Comparative Quantification of Health Risks: Global and regional burden of disease attributable to selected major risk factors (Geneva, World Health Organization, 2004), vol. 2, pp. 1851-1940, and using data of the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs for population under 18 years.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, due to the sensitivity of the issue and the tendency of the crime to stay hidden, the true figure is likely to be much higher.&lt;ref name="ReferenceUNICEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceOHCHR"/&gt;

Girls are more frequent targets for sexual abuse than boys. The WHO study found that 150 million girls were abused compared to 73 million boys. Other sources also conclude that girls face a greater risk of sexual violence, including prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Pinheiro, P. (2006). Rights of the Child: Report of the Independent Expert for the United Nations Study on Violence Against Children. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Pp. 11, 13-14, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes and factors==

===Explanations===
{{main|Causes of sexual violence|Factors associated with being a victim of sexual violence}}
Explaining sexual violence is complicated by the multiple forms it takes and contexts in which it occurs. There is considerable overlap between forms of sexual violence and [[intimate partner violence]]. There are factors increasing the risk of someone being coerced into sex, factors increasing the risk of an individual person forcing sex on another person, and factors within the social environment including peers and family influencing the likelihood of rape and the reaction to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chitiki|first1=Elizabeth|title=Participation in the anti-sexual violence silent protest: a sexual citizenship perspective|date=2018|publisher=Rhodes University|hdl=10962/62916}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Research suggests that the various factors have an [[Behavioral addiction|additive effect]], so that the more factors present, the greater the likelihood of sexual violence. In addition, a particular factor may vary in importance according to the life stage.

=== Risk factors ===

The following are individual risks factors:&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/riskprotectivefactors.html|title=Risk and Protective Factors{{!}}Sexual Violence{{!}}Violence Prevention{{!}}Injury Center{{!}}CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-06|date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Alcohol and drug use
* Delinquency
* Empathic deficits
* General aggressiveness and acceptance of violence
* Early sexual initiation
* Coercive sexual fantasies
* Preference for impersonal sex and sexual-risk taking
* Exposure to sexually explicit media
* Hostility towards women
* Adherence to traditional gender role norms
* Hyper-masculinity
* Suicidal behavior
* Prior sexual victimization or perpetration

The following are relationship risk factors:&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;

* Family environment characterized by physical violence and conflict
* Childhood history of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse
* Emotionally unsupportive family environment
* Poor parent-child relationships, particularly with fathers
* Association with sexually aggressive, hypermasculine, and delinquent peers
* Involvement in a violent or abusive intimate relationship

The following are community factors:&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;

* Poverty
* Lack of employment opportunities
* Lack of institutional support from police and judicial system
* General tolerance of sexual violence within the community
* Weak community sanctions against sexual violence perpetrators

=== Perpetrators ===
There is no stereotypical profile of sexually violent persons. Perpetrators may be coming from various backgrounds, and they may be someone known by the victim like a friend, a family member, an intimate partner, an acquaintance, or they may be a complete stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|WHO|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary motivators behind sexually violent acts are believed to be power and control, and not, as it is widely perceived, a [[sexual desire]]. Sexual violence is rather a violent, aggressive and hostile act aiming to degrade, dominate, humiliate, terrorize and control the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|WHO|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons for committing sexual violence are that it reassures the offender about his sexual adequacy, it discharges frustration, compensates for feelings of helplessness, and achieves sexual gratification.&lt;ref&gt;Groth AN. (2000). The rapist’s view. In: Burgess AW, ed. Violence through a forensic lens. King of Prussia, PA, Nursing Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data on sexually violent men are somewhat limited and heavily biased towards apprehended rapists, except in the United States, where research has also been conducted on male college students. Despite the limited amount of information on sexually violent men, it appears that sexual violence is found in almost all countries (though with differences in prevalence), in all socioeconomic classes and in all age groups from childhood onwards. Data on sexually violent men also show that most direct their acts at women whom they already know.&lt;ref&gt;Heise L, Moore K, Toubia N. Sexual coercion and women's reproductive health: a focus on research. New York, NY, Population Council, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Violence against women: a priority health issue. Geneva, World Health Organization, 1997 (document WHO/FRH/WHD/97.8).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the factors increasing the risk of a man committing rape are those related to attitudes and beliefs, as well as behavior arising from situations and social conditions that provide opportunities and support for abuse.

==Consequences==
Sexual violence is a serious public health problem and it has both short and long term negative physical and psychological effects on health and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|WHO|2003|loc=Chapter 2: "Sexual violence: prevalence, dynamics and consequences".}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that male and female victims of sexual violence may experience similar mental health, behavioral and social consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Patel V, Andrew G. (2001) Gender, sexual abuse and risk behaviours in adolescents: a cross-sectional survey in schools in Goa. National Medical Journal of India, 14(5):263–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dube SR et al.

In: Ezzati M, et al., eds. Comparative quantification of health risks: global and regional burden of disease attributable to selected major risk factors. Geneva, World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Watts, Hossain, and Zimmerman (2013) reported that 72.4% of the victims had at least one gynecological complaint. 52.2% suffered from chronic lower abdominal pain, 27.4% from abnormal vaginal bleeding, 26.6% from infertility, 25.3% from genital sores, and 22.5% from swellings in the abdomen. 18.7% of the participants also suffered from severe psychological and surgical morbidity including alcoholism. 69.4% showed significant psychological distress, 15.8% attempted suicide, 75.6% had at least one surgical complaint. 4.8% of the participants had a positive HIV status.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, C, M. Hossain, C. Zimmerman (2013). In War and Sexual Violence - Mental Health Care for Survivors. The New England Journal of Medicine, 368 (23); 2152-2153&lt;/ref&gt; In child sexual abuse (CSA) cases, the child may suffer mental health disorders that can extend into adult life especially if sexual abuse involved actual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas S., Bebbington P., McMans S., Meltzer H., Jenkins R., Kuipers E., Cooper C., King M., Brugha T.

In addition to the above-mentioned outcomes, in some cases victims of sexual violence may also be stigmatized and ostracized by their families and others.&lt;ref&gt;Mollica RF, Son L. Cultural dimensions in the evaluation and treatment of sexual trauma: an overview. Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 1989, 12:363–379.&lt;/ref&gt; Societal perceptions that the victim provoked sexual violence lead to a lack of disclosure of sexual assault which is associated with even more severe psychological consequences, particularly in children.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero K.J., Smith D.W., Hanson R.F., Resnick H.S., Saunders B.E., Kilpatrick D.G., Best C.L. (2004) Is Disclosure of Childhood Rape Associated with Mental Health Outcome? Results from the National Women’s Study. Child Maltreat. 9(1):62-77&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, more interventions are needed in order to order to change societal attitudes towards sexual violence as well as efforts designed to educate those to whom the survivors may disclose the assault.&lt;ref&gt;McNally R.J., Bryant R.A., &amp; Ehlers A.

==Treatment==
In the [[emergency room]], emergency [[contraceptive]] medications are offered to women raped by men because about 5% of such rapes result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis&gt;{{cite book | author = Varcarolis, Elizabeth| year = 2013 | title = Essentials of psychiatric mental health nursing | location = St. Louis | publisher = Elsevier | pages = 439–442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Preventative healthcare|Preventative]] medication against [[sexually transmitted infection]]s are given to victims of all types of sexual assault (especially for the most common diseases like [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorhea]], [[trichomoniasis]] and [[bacterial vaginosis]]) and a blood serum is collected to test for STIs (such as [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Any survivor with abrasions are immunized for tetanus if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Short-term treatment with a [[benzodiazepine]] may help with acute anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of [[PTSD]], depression and panic attacks.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt;

==Prevention==
{{main| Initiatives to prevent sexual violence}}
The number of initiatives addressing sexual violence is limited and few have been evaluated. The approaches vary with most interventions being developed and implemented in industrialized countries. How relevant they may be in other settings is not well known. Early interventions and the provision of psychological support may prevent or minimize many of the harmful and lasting psychological impacts of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Astbury J, and Jewkes R. (in press) Sexual Violence: A Priority Research Area for Women’s Mental Health&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foa E.B., Davidson J.R.T., Frances A., &amp; Ross R. (1999) Expert Consensus Guideline Series: Treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. J Clin Psychiatry. 60 (Suppl 16)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Resnick H., Acierno R.&amp;WaldropA.E. (2007) Randomized Controlled Evaluation of an Early Intervention to Prevent Post-Rape Psychopathology. Behav Res Ther. 45(10): 2432-2447&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interventions that have been developed can be categorized as follows.

There is also a public health approach to prevention. Because sexual violence is widespread and directly or indirectly affects a community as whole, a community-oriented approach encourages not just victims and advocates to spread awareness and prevent sexual violence, but allocates responsibility to wider community to do so as well. The CDC's report on Sexual Violence Prevention: Beginning the Dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/svprevention-a.pdf|title=Sexual Violence Prevention: Beginning the Dialogue|last=|first=|date=|website=CDC.gov|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests following its four step model.

# Define the Problem: Collect data about the victims, perpetrators, where it's occurring, and how often it's happening. 
# Identify Risk and Protective Factors: Research the risk factors that may put people at risk for victimization of perpetration 
# Develop and Test Prevention Strategies: Work with community leaders, practitioners to test different sexual violence prevention strategies 
# Ensure Widespread Adoption: Implement and spread awareness about the successful prevention strategies

Child sexual abuse prevention programmes were developed in the United States of America during the 1970s and originally delivered to children. Programmes delivered to parents were developed in the 1980s and took the form of one-off meetings, two to three hours long &lt;ref name="Babatsikos"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Babatsikos | first=Georgia | title=Parents' knowledge, attitudes and practices about preventing child sexual abuse: a literature review | journal=Child Abuse Review | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=2010 | issn=0952-9136 | doi=10.1002/car.1102 | pages=107–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hébert"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hébert | first=Martine | last2=Lavoie | first2=Francine | last3=Parent | first3=Nathalie | title=An Assessment of Outcomes Following Parents' Participation in a Child Abuse Prevention Program | journal=Violence and Victims | volume=17 | issue=3 | date=2002-06-01 | issn=0886-6708 | doi=10.1891/vivi.17.3.355.33664 | pages=355–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wurtele Moreno Kenny"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wurtele | first=Sandy K. | last2=Moreno | first2=Tasha | last3=Kenny | first3=Maureen C. | title=Evaluation of a Sexual Abuse Prevention Workshop for Parents of Young Children | journal=Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Trauma | volume=1 | issue=4 | year=2008 | issn=1936-1521 | doi=10.1080/19361520802505768 | pages=331–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wurtele Kenny 2010 pp. 130–152"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wurtele | first=Sandy K. | last2=Kenny | first2=Maureen C. | title=Partnering with parents to prevent childhood sexual abuse | journal=Child Abuse Review | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=2010 | issn=0952-9136 | doi=10.1002/car.1112 | pages=130–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.nspcc.org.uk/HeritageScripts/Hapi.dll/filetransfer/2018FourStepsToThePreventionOfCSAInTheHome.pdf?CookieCheck=43313.725224213&amp;filename=AA58F75CEDE68892A73FB681FE246B8371684F102152F0AA780A14959D3BCE5767137B3B2A935011CBAEC3068664FF681AA6D2524E357BAB96C006752CCD756759AD77BD1E389823A55CFAAE74B2EE64F46C611AD1724BE1AC500B025490CCB1CD8D9D26B00674E723A731951BB13FBE2976BA14838E6BBB09A4FA52BE735F27D92CBFED7FA6CFFA88BC073F0228EAA69F4D1FE158D846D5D4DD33F8F3466703AC49AD67CE927D87622D067280EF2A231A479B85D0572EF2AABC4480&amp;DataSetName=LIVEDATA|title=Four Steps to the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse in the Home|last=Williams|first=Mike|date=2018|website=NSPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.nspcc.org.uk/HeritageScripts/Hapi.dll/filetransfer/2018WorkingWithACommunityToPreventCSAInTheHome.pdf?filename=AA58F75CEDE68892A73FB681FE246B8371684F102152F0AA780A14959D3BCE5767137B3B2A935011CBAEC3068664FF681AA6D2524E357BAB96C006752CCD756759AD77BD1E389823A55CFAAE74B2EE64F46C611AD1724BE1AC500B025490CCB1CD8D9D26B00674E723A731951BB13FBE2976BA14838E6BBB09A4EB52B96A653DDB0BA5CD78B3E4F0B5A317270E32E79B9F7322E26DEE69E8F9DA1AD4D57D6203CA56A4641A004820ECE9E3EB4F712C3FED9F46CEBCE377C14C55CB2FBCFD7942&amp;DataSetName=LIVEDATA|title=Working with a community to prevent child sexual abuse in the home|last=Williams|first=Mike|date=2018|website=NSPCC|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the last 15 years, web-based programmes have been developed.

==Statistics==
{{main| Estimates of sexual violence}}

Sexual violence is a widely underreported phenomenon, therefore available statistics are unlikely to inform about the true scale of the problem. The available data are scanty and fragmented. Police data, for instance, are often incomplete and limited. Data from medico-legal clinics, on the other hand, may be biased towards the more violent incidents of sexual abuse. In addition, the proportion of people who seek medical services for immediate problems related to sexual violence is also relatively small.

Reasons for non-reporting include shame and embarrassment, fear of not being believed, fear of the perpetrator of the crime, fear of the legal process, or disbelief that the police would be able to do anything to help them.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) (1996) Women's Safety Australia 1996, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt; Men are even more reluctant to report sexual violence due to extreme embarrassment and concerns about opinions of other people, their masculinity and the fact that they were unable to prevent the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|WHO|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus information about the extent of sexual violence against males is especially limited. Child sexual abuse is also largely underreported. Most of the data comes from asking adults about their past experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews G, Corry J, Slade T, Issakidis C, and Swanston H. (2004) Comparative risk assessment: child sexual abuse. Final report. Geneva, World Health Organization&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Table.GIF|600px|right|How rape statistics are formulated and how they correspond to the extent of the problem:]]One of the reasons for non-reporting is that children lack independent access to resources. They normally require the cooperation of one of their parents who may refuse to believe their child, or may, in fact, be the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;Cook B, David F, Grant A. (2001) Sexual Violence in Australia. Australian Institute of Criminology Research and Public Policy Series No. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Data on sexual violence typically come from police, clinical settings, [[nongovernmental organizations]] and [[survey research]]. The relationship between these sources and the global magnitude of the problem of sexual violence may be viewed as corresponding to an [[iceberg]] floating in water (see diagram).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jewkes R, Abrahams N. The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview. Social Science and Medicine (in press).&lt;/ref&gt; The small visible tip represents cases reported to police. A larger section may be elucidated through survey research and the work of nongovernmental organizations.

== Culture ==
Sexual violence occurs in all cultures with varying definitions of what constitutes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rozée|first=Patricia|date=1993|title=Forbidden or forgiven? Rape in cross-cultural perspective|url=|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1993.tb00658|pmid=|access-date=|doi-broken-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that in cultures where man and his manly role are prized better, additional perceived or real power may encourage them to think of their "rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daley|first=Ellen|last2=Noland|first2=Virginia|date=2001|title=Intimate Partner Violence in College Students: A Cross-Cultural Comparison|url=http://js.sagamorepub.com/gjhep/article/viewFile/4034/3518|journal=The International Electronic Journal of Health Education|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a woman resists sexual intercourse, it may be perceived as a direct threat by men to their masculinity, triggering a crisis of male identity and contributing to sexual control and violence as it is seen as a way of resolving this crisis. It has been reported that victims who attempt resistance or escape from the situation are more likely to be brutalized by the offender,[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3777345/#ref32 32] thereby giving an inflated sense of power to the abuser as was seen in the New Delhi gang rape case of ''Nirbhaya'' in December 2012. It is likely that in patriarchal cultures, any resistance from the woman victim is perceived by the offender as an insult to his “manhood” further provoking him to resort to more violent means to control the victim.

There is a theory that explains sexual violence as socioculturally constructed which disproves the biological framework that suggests sexual violence is a result of a man's sexual urges. This theory looks to prove that sexual violence is a natural behavior that originates from the "biological propensity to reproduce have a net positive effect on the person's (resorting to sexual violence) reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalra|first=Gurvinder|last2=Bhugra|first2=Dinesh|date=2013-07-01|title=Sexual violence against women: Understanding cross-cultural intersections|url=http://www.indianjpsychiatry.org/text.asp?2013/55/3/244/117139|journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=55|issue=3|pages=244–9|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.117139|pmc=3777345|pmid=24082244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociocultural theory takes into account gender power equations, moral values, male dominance, and attitudes toward violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanday|first=Peggy Reeves|date=1981-10-01|title=The Socio-Cultural Context of Rape: A Cross-Cultural Study|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=5–27|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1981.tb01068.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminism and sexual violence ==

Feminist scholars and activists have made unique contributions to the discourse on sexual violence against women and men
. They have proposed that the root causes of sexual violence lie in the social structure characterized by severe inequality, in which the male is dominant and the female exploited. Feminists also hold that the weak institutional arrangements in place to address consequences of sexual violence, as well as unfair treatment of the victims (or survivors, an alternatively proposed terminology) are direct reflections of the ways in which society regards men, women and the sexual relations between them. Furthermore, feminist critique has led to a closer convergence between feminism and psychology in the study of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, C. A. (1995). Attitudes toward rape: Feminist and social psychological perspectives (Vol. 8). Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conveying a connection between gender-based sexual violence and concepts of power-seeking and subordination was pioneered in the 1970s and has proven to be very influential. Within this context, rape has been assessed as a foremost tool of intimidation used by men against women.&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, S. (1972.). Against our will: men, women and rape. Available at: http://www.susanbrownmiller.com/susanbrownmiller/html/against_our_will.html&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, domestic violence can be viewed as a particularly severe form of patriarchal domination and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Dobash, R. E., &amp; Dobash, R. (1979). Violence against wives: A case against the patriarchy (pp. 179-206). New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist views on pornography|Feminist interpretation of pornography]] also suggests a link between rape and pornography, by which pornography that degrades, humiliates and exercises violence upon the female body feeds a culture which a culture which validates this kinds of behavior;&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, S. (1972.). Let's put pornography back in the closet. Available at: http://www.susanbrownmiller.com/susanbrownmiller/html/antiporno.html.&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is little evidence to prove this.

An intersection of Marxist and feminist theories has been utilized to offer additional insight to the topic of sexual violence.  According to this argument, labor and sex are analogous in the roles they play in their respective overarching exploitative systems: both are produced by the exploited person and both are forcefully taken away from them.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, C. A. (1982). Feminism, Marxism, method, and the state: An agenda for theory. Signs, 7(3), 515-544.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminist scholars have illuminated the idea that all women cannot have uniformly similar experiences of sexual violence or its aftermath. For instance race and ethnicity are significant determinants of these experiences, which serves to show that approaches which are exclusively feminist or exclusively anti-racist in nature are misguided. Instead, a proposition has been made for use of inter-sectionality when studying these cases.&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, K. (1991). Mapping the margins: Intersectionality, identity politics, and violence against women of color. Stanford law review, 1241-1299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist ideas have served as catalysts for transnational movements to combat violence against women, including sexual violence. This agenda has also been adopted by feminist organizations, as illustrated by the current initiative titled the Rape Task Force of the [[National Organization for Women|National Organization for Women (NOW)]].

== International legal framework ==
{{Main|International framework of sexual violence}}
[[International humanitarian law]] (IHL) strongly prohibits sexual violence in all armed conflicts and [[international human rights law]] (IHRL) and [[international customary law]] strongly prohibit it at all times.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2001 57–61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icrc.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Physicians for Human Rights 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 2007"/&gt; IHL ensures women are protected through a two-tiered approach, being covered by general (equal protection as men) and specific protections. IHL mandates special protections to women, according to their additional needs when they are more vulnerable, such as widows, the sick and wounded, migrants, the internally displaced, or those held in detention.&lt;ref name="Customary IHL. Rule 134 on Women"&gt;{{cite web|title=Customary IHL.

Groundbreaking [[case law]] both by the ''ad hoc'' Tribunals of [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) and [[International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) established acts of [[war rape|rape]] and sexual violence as [[Genocide#As a crime|crimes of genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindsey|2001|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bassiouni|first=M.

An extensive amount of both [[Hard law|hard]] and [[soft law]] instruments set rules, standards and norms for the protection of victims of sexual offences.

==History==

===General===
Sexual violence can be traced back to the Greeks and Romans where women were seen as property without any rights over their bodies or sexual integrity. Rape of women during peace times was therefore considered as property crime only affecting their owners: the husbands, sons or brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herik|first=edited by Anne-Marie De Brouwer, Charlotte Ku, Renée Römkens, Larissa van den|title=Sexual violence as an international crime : interdisciplinary approaches|year=1120|publisher=Intersentia|location=Cambridge [etc.]|isbn=978-1-78068-002-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During armed conflict sexual violence, particularly rape, was perceived as a normal byproduct of war, as "a socially acceptable behavior well within the rules of warfare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brownmiller|first=Susan|title=Against our will : men, women, and rape|year=1993|publisher=Fawcett Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-449-90820-4|edition=1st Ballantine Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Greece, women were sometimes the reason for the attack of a city, conquering women as new wives or concubines, legitimate booty, as slaves or as trophies. The fact that sexual violence to women was commonplace during both war and peace times led to the negligence of any indications of what the methods, aims and magnitude of such violence was; it was face- and nameless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heineman|2011|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The [[Middle Ages]] strongly reflected the patriarchal sexual violence view. During times of peace, female spouses had no right to refuse sex with their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Cruze|first=Shani|title=Approaching the History of Rape and Sexual Violence: Notes towards Research|journal=[[Women's History Review]]|year=2011|volume=1|issue=3|page=382|doi=10.1080/09612029300200016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though laws punishing rapes existed, sexual violence was usually considered as justified or inconsequential. Usually, depending on the elite's views, which perceived sexual violence as a minor issue, sexual violence was not prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruggiero|first=Guido|title=Sexual Criminality in the Early Renaissance: Venice 1338-1358|journal=Journal of Social History|year=1975|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was also transferred to the colonies. In Alta California, for example, the Catholic clergy relied heavily on corporal punishment such as flogging, placing in the stocks or shackling of Amerinindian women within their programs of Christianization.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heineman|2011|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this context of trying to restore a certain social order, women were often the victims of sexual violence if politically active and posing a threat to the existing order.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heineman|2011|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to times of war, jurists, writers and scholars argued that as soon as war is just, no boundaries would be set towards methods used in order to achieve victory. However, with [[Alberico Gentili]] (1552–1608) discussions started that suffering of women should be reduced and rape prohibited during peace and war times. However, this view was not accepted for a long time, as women and children not participating in the fighting were still considered as being the enemy and the patriarchal view on women prevailed during peace and war times.

===Codification of laws of war on gender-related crimes===
Gradually, over the centuries laws and customs of war changed in direction of a wider understanding of sexual violence and the need to protect the victims. During the American civil war, the US started to codify the customary rules regulating land-based wars. With the [[Lieber Code]] of 1863, President Lincoln tried to regulate the conduct of Union soldiers and prohibited explicitly rape.&lt;ref name="Kuo 2002 306"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuo|first=Peggy|title=Prosecuting Crimes of Sexual Violence in an International Tribunal|journal=Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law|year=2002|volume=34|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[First Geneva Convention|first-ever Geneva Convention]] one year after and the Fourth [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] 1907 followed this line by advocating the protection of family rights and honor, implying specifically also the prohibition of rape. But the only enforcement mechanisms were the military commanders themselves, having the right to execute the soldiers immediately.&lt;ref name="Kuo 2002 306"/&gt;

After [[World War I]], a War Crimes Commission was established in order to bring war criminals before justice. Forced prostitution and rape was seen as grave violation of the customs and laws of war. Under the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg (IMT) and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East at Tokyo (IMTFE), the spectrum of sexual violence as war crime was widened even though rape was not explicitly mentioned. The transcripts of the trials contain evidence of rape, sexual slavery, sexual torture, forced prostitution, forced sterilization, forced abortion, pornography, sexual mutilation, forced nudity and [[Sexual sadism disorder|sexual sadism]]. But only after the Tokyo Tribunal, when Japanese commanders were prosecuted the first time based on the chain of command for not having prevented rape and sexual slavery of [[comfort women]] during the Second World War, was sexual violence gradually considered as a grave war crime in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campanaro|2002|p=2564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Argibay|first=Carmen M.|title=Sexual Slavery and the "Comfort Women" of World War II|journal=Berkeley Journal of International Law|year=2003|volume=21|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was the first time expressed after Nuremberg and Tokyo in the second series of trials for the prosecution of "lesser" war criminals where the Control Council Law No. 10 explicitly listed rape constituting a crime against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Control Council Law No. 10|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imt10.asp|publisher=Yale Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campanaro|2002|p=2565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14173">The '''temporal dynamics of music and language''' describes how the brain coordinates its different regions to process musical and vocal sounds. Both music and language feature rhythmic and melodic structure. Both employ a finite set of basic elements (such as tones or words) that are combined in ordered ways to create complete musical or lingual ideas.

==Neuroanotomy of language and music==

Key areas of the brain are used in both music processing and language processing, such as [[Brocas area]] that is devoted to language production and comprehension. Patients with lesions, or damage, in the Brocas area often exhibit poor grammar, slow speech production and poor sentence comprehension. The [[inferior frontal gyrus]], is a [[gyrus]] of the [[frontal lobe]] that is involved in timing events and reading comprehension, particularly for the comprehension of [[verb]]s. The [[Wernickes area]] is located on the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] and is important for understanding [[vocabulary]] and written language.

The [[primary auditory cortex]] is located on the [[temporal lobe]] of the [[cerebral cortex]]. This region is important in music processing and plays an important role in determining the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and volume of a sound.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ghazanfar | first1 = A. A. | last2 = Nicolelis | first2 = M.

The [[frontal cortex]] has been found to be involved in processing melodies and harmonies of music. For example, when a patient is asked to tap out a beat or try to reproduce a tone, this region is very active on [[fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scans.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Theunissen | first1 = F | last2 = David | first2 = SV | last3 = Singh | first3 = NC | last4 = Hsu | first4 = A | last5 = Vinje | first5 = WE | last6 = Gallant | first6 = JL | year = 2001 | title = Estimating spatio-temporal receptive fields of auditory and visual neurons from their responses to natural stimuli | url = | journal = Network: Computation in Neural Systems | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 289–316 | pmid = 11563531 | doi= 10.1080/net.12.3.289.316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cerebellum]] is the "mini" brain at the rear of the skull. Similar to the frontal cortex, brain imaging studies suggest that the cerebellum is involved in processing melodies and determining [[tempo]]s. The [[medial prefrontal cortex]] along with the primary auditory cortex has also been implicated in tonality, or determining pitch and volume.&lt;ref name="aa" /&gt;

In addition to the specific regions mentioned above many "information switch points" are active in language and music processing. These regions are believed to act as transmission routes that conduct information. These neural impulses allow the above regions to communicate and process information correctly. These structures include the [[thalamus]] and the [[basal ganglia]].&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt;

Some of the above-mentioned areas have been shown to be active in both music and language processing through PET and fMRI studies. These areas include the primary motor cortex, the Brocas area, the cerebellum, and the primary auditory cortices.&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt;

==Imaging the brain in action==

The imaging techniques best suited for studying temporal dynamics provide information in real time. The methods most utilized in this research are functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, and positron emission tomography known as PET scans.&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baird | first1 = A. | last2 = Samson | first2 = S. V. | doi = 10.1007/s11065-009-9085-2 | title = Memory for Music in Alzheimer's Disease: Unforgettable? | journal = Neuropsychology Review | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–101 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19214750| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positron emission tomography involves injecting a short-lived [[radioactive tracer]] [[isotope]] into the blood. When the radioisotope decays, it emits positrons which are detected by the machine sensor. The isotope is chemically incorporated into a biologically active molecule, such as [[glucose]], which powers metabolic activity. Whenever brain activity occurs in a given area these molecules are recruited to the area. Once the concentration of the biologically active molecule, and its radioactive "dye", rises enough, the scanner can detect it.&lt;ref name="cc" /&gt; About one second elapses from when brain activity begins to when the activity is detected by the PET device. This is because it takes a certain amount of time for the dye to reach the needed concentrations can be detected.&lt;ref name="dd"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 1852337982 | title = Positron Emission Tomography: Basic Sciences.

 [[File:PET-MIPS-anim.gif|thumb|left|alt=PET. |Example of a PET scan.]]
[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] or fMRI is a form of the traditional [[MRI]] imaging device that allows for brain activity to be observed in real time. An fMRI device works by detecting changes in neural blood flow that is associated with brain activity. fMRI devices use a strong, static magnetic field to align nuclei of atoms within the brain. An additional magnetic field, often called the [[gradient field]], is then applied to elevate the nuclei to a higher energy state.&lt;ref name="ee"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hauk | first1 = O | last2 = Wakeman | first2 = D | last3 = Henson | first3 = R | year = 2011 | title = Comparison of noise-normalized minimum norm estimates for MEG analysis using multiple resolution metrics | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 1966–74 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.053 | pmid = 20884360 | pmc=3018574}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the gradient field is removed, the nuclei revert to their original state and emit energy. The emitted energy is detected by the fMRI machine and is used to form an image. When neurons become active blood flow to those regions increases. This oxygen-rich blood displaces oxygen depleted blood in these areas. [[Hemoglobin]] molecules in the oxygen-carrying red blood cells have different magnetic properties depending on whether it is oxygenated.&lt;ref name="ee" /&gt; By focusing the detection on the magnetic disturbances created by hemoglobin, the activity of neurons can be mapped in near real time.&lt;ref name="ee" /&gt; Few other techniques allow for researchers to study temporal dynamics in real time.

[[File:NIMH MEG.jpg|thumb|right|alt=MEG.|Patient gets a "MEG".]]

Another important tool for analyzing temporal dynamics is [[magnetoencephalography]], known as MEG. It is used to map brain activity by detecting and recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents generated by neural activity. The device uses a large array of superconducting quantum interface devices, called [[SQUID]]S, to detect magnetic activity. Because the magnetic fields generated by the human brain are so small the entire device must be placed in a specially designed room that is built to shield the device from external magnetic fields.&lt;ref name="ee" /&gt;

==Other research methods==

Another common method for studying brain activity when processing language and music is [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] or TMS. TMS uses induction to create weak electromagnetic currents within the brain by using a rapidly changing magnetic field. The changes depolarize or hyper-polarize neurons. This can produce or inhibit activity in different regions. The effect of the disruptions on function can be used to assess brain interconnections.&lt;ref name="gg"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Recent research==

Many aspects of language and musical melodies are processed by the same brain areas. In 2006, Brown, Martinez and Parsons found that listening to a melody or a sentence resulted in activation of many of the same areas including the [[primary motor cortex]], the [[supplementary motor area]], the Brocas area, anterior insula, the primary audio cortex, the thalamus, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum.&lt;ref name="hh"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = S. | last2 = Martinez | first2 = M.

A 2008 study by Koelsch, Sallat and Friederici found that language impairment may also affect the ability to process music. Children with specific language impairments, or SLIs were not as proficient at matching tones to one another or at keeping tempo with a simple [[metronome]] as children with no language disabilities. This highlights the fact that neurological disorders that effect language may also affect musical processing ability.&lt;ref name="ii"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jentschke | first1 = S. | last2 = Koelsch | first2 = S. | last3 = Sallat | first3 = S. | last4 = Friederici | first4 = A.

Walsh, Stewart, and Frith in 2001 investigated which regions processed melodies and language by asking subjects to create a melody on a simple keyboard or write a poem. They applied TMS to the location where musical and lingual data. The research found that TMS applied to the left frontal lobe had affected the ability to write or produce language material, while TMS applied to the auditory and Brocas area of the brain most inhibited the research subject’s ability to play musical melodies. This suggests that some differences exist between music and language creation.&lt;ref name="jj"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = L. | last2 = Walsh | first2 = V. | last3 = Frith | first3 = U.

==Developmental aspects==

The basic elements of musical and lingual processing appear to be present at birth. For example, a French 2011 study that monitored fetal heartbeats found that past the age of 28 weeks, fetuses respond to changes in musical pitch and tempo. Baseline heart rates were determined by 2 hours of monitoring before any stimulus. Descending and ascending frequencies at different tempos were played near the [[womb]]. The study also investigated fetal response to lingual patterns, such as playing a sound clip of different syllables, but found no response to different lingual stimulus. Heart rates increased in response to high pitch loud sounds compared to low pitched soft sounds. This suggests that the basic elements of sound processing, such as discerning pitch, tempo and loudness are present at birth, while later-developed processes discern speech patterns after birth.&lt;ref name="kk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granier-Deferre | first1 = C | last2 = Ribeiro | first2 = A | last3 = Jacquet | first3 = A | last4 = Bassereau | first4 = S | year = 2011 | title = Near-term fetuses process temporal features of speech | url = | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 336–352 | pmid = 22213904 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.00978.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study researched the development of lingual skills in children with speech difficulties. It found that musical stimulation improved the outcome of traditional [[speech therapy]]. Children aged 3.5 to 6 years old were separated into two groups. One group heard lyric-free music at each speech therapy session while the other group was given traditional speech therapy. The study found that both phonological capacity and the children’s ability to understand speech increased faster in the group that was exposed to regular musical stimulation.&lt;ref name="tt"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = W | last2 = Linden | first2 = U | last3 = Ostermann | first3 = T | year = 2010 | title = Effects of music therapy in the treatment of children with delayed speech development -results of a pilot study | url = | journal = BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 1| page = 39 | pmid = 20663139 | doi=10.1186/1472-6882-10-39 | pmc=2921108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thanksgiving Day''' is a national [[holiday]] celebrated on various dates in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], some of the [[Caribbean|Caribbean islands]], and [[Liberia]]. It began as a day of giving thanks for the blessing of the [[harvest]] and of the preceding year. Similarly named festival holidays occur in [[Germany]] and [[Japan]]. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|second Monday of October]] in Canada and on the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|fourth Thursday of November]] in the United States, and around the same part of the year in other places.  Although Thanksgiving has historical roots in religious and cultural traditions, it has long been celebrated as a [[Secularity|secular]] holiday as well.

==History==
Prayers of thanks and special thanksgiving ceremonies are common among almost all religions after harvests and at other times.&lt;ref name="Hodg 1"/&gt;  The Thanksgiving holiday's history in North America is rooted in English traditions dating from the Protestant [[Reformation]].  It also has aspects of a [[harvest festival]], even though the harvest in [[New England]] occurs well before the late-November date on which the modern Thanksgiving holiday is celebrated.&lt;ref name="Hodg 1"&gt;Hodgson, pp. 156–59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Chapter 1, especially pp. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English tradition, days of thanksgiving and special thanksgiving religious services became important during the [[English Reformation]] in the reign of [[Henry VIII]] and in reaction to the large number of religious holidays on the Catholic calendar.  Before 1536 there were 95 Church holidays, plus 52 Sundays, when people were required to attend church and forego work and sometimes pay for expensive celebrations. The 1536 reforms reduced the number of Church holidays to 27, but some [[Puritan]]s wished to completely eliminate all Church holidays, including [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]].  The holidays were to be replaced by specially called [[Days of humiliation and thanksgiving|Days of Fasting or Days of Thanksgiving]], in response to events that the Puritans viewed as acts of [[Divine providence|special providence]].  Unexpected disasters or threats of judgement from on high called for Days of Fasting.  Special blessings, viewed as coming from God, called for Days of Thanksgiving.  For example, Days of Fasting were called on account of drought in 1611, floods in 1613, and plagues in 1604 and 1622. Days of Thanksgiving were called following the victory over the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 and following the deliverance of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1705.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; An unusual annual Day of Thanksgiving began in 1606 following the failure of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] in 1605 and developed into [[Guy Fawkes Day]] on November 5.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite book  | last =Baker | first =James W.  | title =Thanksgiving: the biography of an American holiday | publisher =UPNE | year =2009 |pages =1–14 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=yoMhqK9Z5HwC&amp;dq | isbn =9781584658016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Canada===
{{Main|Thanksgiving (Canada)}}

According to some historians, the first celebration of Thanksgiving in North America occurred during the 1578 voyage of Martin Frobisher from England in search of the Northwest Passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mills|first1=David|last2=Neilson Bonikowsky|first2=Laura|last3=McIntosh|first3=Andrew|title=Thanksgiving in Canada|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/thanksgiving-day/|website=Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers, however, state that "there is no compelling narrative of the origins of the Canadian Thanksgiving day."&lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaufman|first=Jason Andrew|title=The Origins of Canadian &amp; American Political Differences|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674031364|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC6piY4KaLQC&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of Canadian Thanksgiving are also sometimes traced to the French settlers who came to [[New France]] in the 17th century, who celebrated their successful harvests. The French settlers in the area typically had feasts at the end of the harvest season and continued throughout the winter season, even sharing food with the [[indigenous peoples]] of the area.&lt;ref name=Ruth&gt;Solski, Ruth "Canada's Traditions and Celebrations" McGill-Queen's Press,{{ISBN|1550356941}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

As settlers arrived in Nova Scotia from New England after 1700, late autumn Thanksgiving celebrations became commonplace. New immigrants into the country—such as the Irish, Scottish, and Germans—also added their own traditions to the harvest celebrations. Most of the US aspects of Thanksgiving (such as the turkey) were incorporated when [[United Empire Loyalist]]s began to flee from the United States during the [[American Revolution]] and settled in Canada.&lt;ref name=Ruth /&gt;

===In the United States===
{{Main|Thanksgiving (United States)}}
[[File:Thanksgiving-Brownscombe.jpg|left|thumb|[[Jennie Augusta Brownscombe]], ''The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth'', 1914, [[Pilgrim Hall Museum]], Plymouth, Massachusetts]]
[[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] and [[Puritans]] who emigrated from England in the 1620s and 1630s carried the tradition of Days of Fasting and Days of Thanksgiving with them to [[New England]]. The modern Thanksgiving holiday tradition is traced to a well-recorded 1619 event in Virginia and a sparsely documented 1621 celebration at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] in present-day [[Massachusetts]]. The 1619 arrival of 38 English settlers at [[Berkeley Hundred]] in Charles City County, Virginia, concluded with a religious celebration as dictated by the group's charter from the [[London Company]], which specifically required "that the day of our ships arrival at the place assigned ... in the land of Virginia shall be yearly and perpetually kept holy as a day of thanksgiving to [[Almighty God]]." The 1621 Plymouth feast and thanksgiving was prompted by a good harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vahistorical.org/read-watch-listen/video-and-audio/first-thanksgiving|title=The First Thanksgiving|publisher=The Virginia Historical Society|accessdate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Plantation|author=[[Clifford Dowdey|Dowdy, Clifford]]|publisher=Rinehart and Co.|year=1957|pages=29–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several days of Thanksgiving were held in early New England history that have been identified as the "First Thanksgiving", including Pilgrim holidays in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] in 1621 and 1623, and a Puritan holiday in [[Boston]] in 1631.&lt;ref name="Baker, Chapter 1"&gt;Baker, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=History2&gt;{{cite book|url =https://books.google.com/?id=qf9nq9lFwyQC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=thanksgiving+holiday+give+thanks+God+Noah#v=onepage&amp;q=thanksgiving%20holiday%20give%20thanks%20God%20Noah&amp;f=false|title = How Christianity Changed the World|quote=Their leader, Governor William Bradford, issued a formal proclamation commanding the people to give thanks to God for having received divine protection during a terrible winter and for having received their first harvest.

Thanksgiving proclamations were made mostly by church leaders in New England up until 1682, and then by both state and church leaders until after the [[American Revolution]]. During the revolutionary period, political influences affected the issuance of Thanksgiving proclamations. Various proclamations were made by royal governors, [[John Hancock]], General [[George Washington]], and the [[Continental Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klos|first=Stanley|title=Thanksgiving Day Proclamations|url=http://www.thanksgivingproclamations.com/|work=Presidential Thanksgiving Proclamations|publisher=Historic.us|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  each giving thanks to God for events favorable to their causes.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, pp. 159–66&lt;/ref&gt; As President of the United States, George Washington proclaimed the first nationwide thanksgiving celebration in America marking November 26, 1789, "as a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favours of Almighty God".&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

====Debate about the nation's first celebrations====
[[File:Berkeley Plantation, Shrine marking 1st Thanksgiving in America.jpg|thumb|right|Shrine of the first U.S. Thanksgiving in 1619 at Berkeley Hundred in Charles City County, Virginia]]
The question of where the first Thanksgiving was held in the United States has been a subject of debate, primarily between New England and Virginia, complicated by the concept of Thanksgiving as a holiday celebration versus a religious service. James Baker maintains, "The American holiday's true origin was the New England [[Calvinist]] Thanksgiving. Never coupled with a Sabbath meeting, the Puritan observances were special days set aside during the week for thanksgiving and praise in response to God's providence."&lt;ref name="Baker, Chapter 1"/&gt; Baker calls the debate a "tempest in a beanpot" and "marvelous nonsense" based on regional claims.&lt;ref name="Baker, Chapter 1"/&gt; However, the day for Thanksgiving services specifically codified in the founding [[charter]] of [[Berkeley Hundred]] in 1619 was instrumental in President John F. Kennedy's attempt to strike a compromise between the regional claims, by issuing Proclamation 3560 on November 5, 1963, stating, "Over three centuries ago, our forefathers in Virginia and in Massachusetts, far from home in a lonely wilderness, set aside a time of thanksgiving. On the appointed day, they gave reverent thanks for their safety, for the health of their children, for the fertility of their fields, for the love which bound them together, and for the faith which united them with their God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=9511|title=John F.

Other claims include an earlier religious service by Spanish explorers in Texas at [[San Elizario]] in 1598.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2011).

===Fixing date===
====Canada====
The earlier Thanksgiving celebrations in Canada has been attributed to the earlier onset of winter in the North, thus ending the harvest season earlier.&lt;ref name=Kauf&gt;Kaufman, Jason Andrew (2009). "The origins of Canadian and American political differences" Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|0674031369}} p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Thanksgiving in Canada did not have a fixed date until the late 19th century. Prior to [[Canadian Confederation]], many of the individual colonial governors of the Canadian provinces had declared their own days of Thanksgiving. The first official Canadian Thanksgiving occurred on April 15, 1872, when the nation was celebrating the [[George V of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]]' recovery from a serious illness.&lt;ref name=Kauf /&gt; By the end of the 19th century, Thanksgiving Day was normally celebrated on November 6. However, when [[World War I]] ended, the [[Remembrance Day|Armistice Day]] holiday was usually held during the same week. To prevent the two holidays from clashing with one another, in 1957 the [[Canadian Parliament]] proclaimed Thanksgiving to be observed on its present date on the second Monday of October.&lt;ref name=Ruth /&gt;

====United States====
Thanksgiving in the United States was observed on various dates throughout history. From the time of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] until the time of Lincoln, the date Thanksgiving was observed varied from state to state. The final Thursday in November had become the customary date in most U.S. states by the beginning of the 19th century, coinciding with and eventually superseding the existing holiday of [[Evacuation Day (New York)|Evacuation Day]] (a day commemorating the British exit from the United States following the Revolutionary War).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Modern Thanksgiving was first officially called for in all states in 1863 by a presidential proclamation of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Influenced by the campaigning of author [[Sarah Josepha Hale]], who wrote letters to politicians for around 40 years trying to make it an official holiday, Lincoln proclaimed a national Thanksgiving on the final Thursday in November, explicitly in celebration of the bounties that had continued to fall on the Union and for the military successes in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/thanks.htm|title=Thanksgiving Proclamation by Abraham Lincoln|website=www.abrahamlincolnonline.org|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the ongoing [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a nationwide Thanksgiving date was not realized until [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was completed in the 1870s.

On October 31, 1939, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed a [[Franksgiving|presidential proclamation]] changing the holiday to the next to last Thursday in November, for business reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/188846244/?terms=Thanksgiving%2Broosevelt "Declares Nov. 23 as Thanksgiving," Associated Press, ''Green Bay Press-Gazette,'' Wisconsin, October 31, 1939, p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 26, 1941, he signed a [[joint resolution]] of Congress changing the national Thanksgiving Day from the last Thursday in November to the fourth Thursday.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/thanksgiving "Congress Establishes Thanksgiving," Center for Legislative Analysis, National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1971, when the American [[Uniform Monday Holiday Act]] took effect, the American observance of [[Columbus Day]] has coincided with the Canadian observance of Thanksgiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=LBJ Signs Bill to Set Up Five 3-Day Holidays |agency=Associated Press |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |publisher=via Google News |date=June 29, 1968 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9eYhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5GUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6061,7091289&amp;dq=district+of+columbia&amp;hl=en |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}The bill in question became the [[Uniform Monday Holiday Act]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/winter/images/uniform-monday-holiday-law.jpg |title= Text of the 1968 Uniform Monday Holiday Act |publisher=US Government Archives (www.archives.gov)|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observance==
===Australia===
In the [[States and territories of Australia|Australian external territory]] of [[Norfolk Island]], Thanksgiving is celebrated on the last Wednesday of November, similar to the pre–[[World War II]] American observance on the last Thursday of the month. This means the Norfolk Island observance is the day before or six days after the [[United States|United States']] observance. The holiday was brought to the island by visiting American [[whaling]] ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/TerritoriesofAustralia_NorfolkIsland_NorfolkIslandInformationandServices#Public |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920094330/http://ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/TerritoriesofAustralia_NorfolkIsland_NorfolkIslandInformationandServices#Public |title=Norfolk Island Information and Services |archivedate=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanksgiving ({{lang-fr|l'Action de grâce}}), occurring on the second Monday in October, is an annual Canadian [[holiday]] to [[gratitude|give thanks]] at the close of the harvest season. Although the original act of Parliament references [[God]] and the holiday is celebrated in churches, the holiday is mostly celebrated in a [[Secularity|secular]] manner. Thanksgiving is a [[Public holidays in Canada|statutory holiday]] in all provinces in Canada, except for [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. While businesses may remain open in these provinces, the holiday is nonetheless recognized and celebrated regardless of its status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workrights.ca/content.php?sec=9 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218131207/http://www.workrights.ca/content.php?sec=9 |archivedate=December 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/lae/employmentrights/thanksgiving.asp |title=Thanksgiving – is it a Statutory Holiday? |publisher=Government of Nova Scotia |accessdate=October 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.pe.ca/law/statutes/pdf/e-06_2.pdf |title=Statutes, Chapter E-6.2 |publisher=Government of Prince Edward Island |format=PDF |accessdate=October 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assembly.nl.ca/Legislation/sr/statutes/l02.htm#14_ |title=RSNL1990 Chapter L-2 – Labour Standards Act |publisher=Assembly of Newfoundland |accessdate=October 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/lp/spila/clli/eslc/stat_hol.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229081421/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/lp/spila/clli/eslc/stat_hol.pdf |archivedate=February 29, 2008 |format=PDF |publisher=Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, Canada |title=Statutory Holidays}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grenada===
In the West Indian island of [[Grenada]], in the [[Caribbean]], there is a national holiday known as Thanksgiving Day which is celebrated on October 25. Even though it bears the same name, and is celebrated at roughly the same time as the American and Canadian versions of Thanksgiving, this holiday is unrelated to either of those celebrations. Instead the holiday marks the anniversary of the U.S.-led [[Invasion of Grenada|invasion of the island]] in 1983, in response to the [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] and execution of the socialist Grenadian Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gov.gd/holiday_events.html |title=Public Holidays &amp; Events 2017 |website=GOV.gd |date=2016-10-12 |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a military government from within his own party.

===Liberia===
In the West African country of Liberia, which began in 1820 with the colonization of freed [[Slavery in the United States|African Americans]]  ([[Americo-Liberian]]s) from the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the first Thursday of November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vice President Boakai Joins Catholic Community in Bomi to Celebrate Thanksgiving Day|url=http://www.emansion.gov.lr/2press.php?news_id=1709&amp;related=20&amp;pg=sp&amp;sub=41|work=The Executive Mansion|publisher=Republic of Liberia|accessdate=October 5, 2014|date=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
[[File:25446 Pieterskerk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Pieterskerk]]
Many of the Pilgrims who migrated to the [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth Plantation]] had resided in the city of [[Leiden]] from 1609–1620, and had recorded their births, marriages, and deaths at the [[Pieterskerk, Leiden|Pieterskerk]] (St. Peter's church). To commemorate this, a non-denominational Thanksgiving Day service is held each year on the morning of the American Thanksgiving Day in the Pieterskerk, a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church in Leiden, noting the hospitality the Pilgrims received in Leiden on their way to the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Dutch town|url=http://www.theworld.org/?q=node/22856&amp;answer=true |quote=The Pilgrims arrived in Leiden in 1609, after fleeing religious persecution in England. Leiden welcomed them because it needed immigrants to help rebuild its textile industry, which had been devastated by a long revolt against Spain. Here, the Pilgrims were allowed to worship as they wanted, and they even published their arguments calling for the separation of church and state. Jeremy Bangs directs the Leiden American Pilgrim Museum. He says the Pilgrims quickly adopted several Dutch customs, like civil marriage and Thanksgiving. |work=[[The World (radio program)]] |accessdate=November 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides this, Thanksgiving is observed by orthodox Protestant churches in The Netherlands on the first Wednesday in November ({{ill|Dankdag|nl|Biddag en Dankdag voor Gewas en Arbeid|vertical-align=sup}}). It is not a public holiday. Those who observe the day either only go to church in the evening or take the day off and go to church in the morning (and occasionally afternoon) too.

===Philippines===
The Philippines, while it was an American colony in the first half of the 20th century, celebrated Thanksgiving as a special public holiday on the same day as the Americans. During the Japanese occupation during [[World War II]], both the Americans and Filipinos celebrated Thanksgiving in secret. After Japanese withdrawal in 1945, the tradition continued until 1965. It was revived by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], but on every September 21, when martial law was imposed in the country. After [[People Power Revolution|Marcos' ouster]] in 1986, the tradition was no longer continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://malacanang.gov.ph/74644-thanksgiving-in-the-philippines/ |title=Thanksgiving in the Philippines |work=Philippine Presidential Museum and Library |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Thanksgiving (United States)}}
Thanksgiving, currently celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November by federal legislation in 1941, has been an annual tradition in the United States by presidential proclamation since 1863 and by state legislation since the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. Historically, Thanksgiving has traditionally been a celebration of the blessings of the year, including the harvest.&lt;ref name=EB-TD&gt;

===Germany===
[[File:Treherz Pfarrkirche Erntedankteppich 2007.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A food decoration for Erntedankfest, a Christian Thanksgiving harvest festival celebrated in Germany]]
The Harvest Thanksgiving Festival, {{ill|Erntedankfest|de|Erntedankfest|vertical-align=sup}}, is a popular German [[Christianity|Christian]] festival in early October. The festival has a significant religious component, and unlike its North American counterpart, it usually does not include large dinners. Many churches are decorated with autumn crops, beautifully arranged in front of the altar. In some places, there are religious processions or parades. Many Bavarian beer festivals, like the Munich [[Oktoberfest]], take place within the vicinity of ''Erntedankfest.''

The United States has observed [[German-American Day]] annually on October 6, within the vicinity of Erntedankfest, from 1883 until the early 1910s, then again from 1983 to the present day.

===Japan===
{{main|Labor Thanksgiving Day}}
{{nihongo|Labor Thanksgiving Day|勤労感謝の日|Kinrō Kansha no Hi}} is a [[Holidays of Japan|national holiday in Japan]]. It takes place annually on November 23. The law establishing the holiday, which was adopted during the [[American occupation of Japan|American occupation]] after World War II, cites it as an occasion for commemorating [[Manual labor|labor]] and production and giving one another thanks.  It has roots in an ancient [[Shinto]] harvest ceremony ({{nihongo|''[[Niiname-sai]]''|新嘗祭|}}).

===United Kingdom===

The [[Harvest Festival]] of Thanksgiving does not have an official date in the United Kingdom; however, it is traditionally held on or near the Sunday of the harvest moon that occurs closest to the autumnal equinox. Harvest Thanksgiving in Britain also has pre-Christian roots when the Saxons would offer the first sheaf of barley, oats, or wheat to fertility gods. When the harvest was finally collected, communities would come together for a harvest supper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crewsnest.vispa.com/thanksgivingUK.htm |title=Harvest Festival UK |website=Crewsnest.vispa.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Christianity arrived in Britain many traditions remained, and today the Harvest Festival is marked by churches and schools in late September/early October (same as Canada) with singing, praying and decorating with baskets of food and fruit to celebrate a successful harvest and to give thanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/harvest.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623163507/http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/Harvest.html |archivedate=June 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collections of food are usually held which are then given to local charities which help the homeless and those in need.

It was founded in 1857 as '''''The Atlantic Monthly''''' in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and began as a literary and cultural commentary magazine publishing leading writers' commentary on [[Antislavery Movement In America|abolition]], education, and other major issues in contemporary political affairs. Its founders included [[Francis H. Underwood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Encyclopaedia of the Essay|author=Chevalier, Tracy |date= 2012|title=The Atlantic Monthly American magazine, 1857}} "The Atlantic Monthly was founded in Boston in 1857 by Francis Underwood (an assistant to the publisher..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A History of the Atlantic Monthly, 1857-1909|author=Sedgwick, Ellery |date= 2009|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with prominent writers [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], and [[John Greenleaf Whittier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Letters of John Greenleaf Whittier|author=Whittier, John Greenleaf|volume= 2|date= 1975 |page=318}} "...however, was the founding of the Atlantic Monthly in 1857.

After financial hardship and ownership changes in the late 20th century, the magazine was purchased by businessman [[David G. Bradley]], who turned it into a general editorial magazine primarily aimed at a target audience of serious national readers and "[[thought leader]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ |journal=The Atlantic |title=Home page|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''The Atlantic'' posted its first profit in a decade.&lt;ref name="NYT20120326"&gt;{{cite news |author=Peters, Jeremy W. |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/business/media/13atlantic.html?pagewanted=all |title=Web Focus Helps Revitalize The Atlantic |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 12, 2010|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The periodical was named Magazine of the Year by the [[American Society of Magazine Editors]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwd.com/business-news/media/american-society-magazine-editors-asme-winners-2016-ellies-national-magazine-awards-atlantic10336083-10336083/|title=The American Society of Magazine Editors Crowns The Atlantic Magazine of the Year at Ellies|last=Steigrad|first=Alexandra|date=2016-02-02|work=WWD|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, Bradley sold a majority interest in the publication to [[Laurene Powell Jobs]]'s [[Emerson Collective]].&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Gillian B.|title=Emerson Collective Acquires Majority Stake in The Atlantic|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/07/emerson-collective-atlantic-coalition/535215/|accessdate=28 July 2017|work=The Atlantic|date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/7/28/16055162/laurene-powell-jobs-acquired-atlantic-magazine-publisher-steve-widow-philanthropist-nonprofit|title=Laurene Powell Jobs is buying the Atlantic magazine|work=Recode|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/interactives/2018/politico50/laurene-powell-jobs/|title=Laurene Powell Jobs - POLITICO 50 2018|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format, publication frequency, and name==
The magazine, subscribed to by over 450,000 readers, now publishes ten times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/07/business/07ATLA.html?ex=1224129600&amp;en=7a32bba6b6e6f7ff&amp;ei=5070 |title=Media Talk: This Summer, It's the Atlantic Not-Monthly |first=Alex |last=Kuczynski|date=May 7, 2001|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=October 7, 2010}} A change of name was not officially announced when the format first changed from a strict monthly (appearing 12 times a year) to a slightly lower frequency.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a monthly magazine for 144 years until 2001, when it published eleven issues; it published ten issues yearly from 2003 on, dropped "Monthly" from the cover starting with the January/February 2004 issue, and officially changed the name in 2007.

On January 22, 2008, TheAtlantic.com dropped its subscriber wall and allowed users to freely browse its site, including all past archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200801u/editors-note|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509191810/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200801u/editors-note|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 9, 2008|title=Editors' Note |work=The Atlantic|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011 ''The Atlantic''{{'}}s web properties included TheAtlanticWire.com, a news- and opinion-tracking site launched in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.observer.com/2011/01/exclusive-exgawker-guy-snyder-to-head-atlantic-wire-new-manhattan-staff |title=Exclusive: Ex-Gawker Guy Snyder to Head Atlantic Wire, New Manhattan Staff |date=January 31, 2011|author= Summers, Nick|work=The New York Observer|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and TheAtlanticCities.com, a stand-alone website started in 2011 that was devoted to global cities and trends.&lt;ref name="Folio"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.foliomag.com/2011/atlantic-debuts-atlanticcities-com |title=The Atlantic Debuts TheAtlanticCities.com |work=FOLIO Magazine |date=September 15, 2011|author=Welton, Caysey |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a ''[[Mashable]]'' profile in December 2011, "traffic to the three web properties recently surpassed 11 million uniques per month, up a staggering 2500% since ''The Atlantic'' brought down its paywall in early 2008."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://mashable.com/2011/12/19/the-atlantic-digital-first/ |title= Inside The Atlantic: How One Magazine Got Profitable by Going 'Digital First' |date= December 19, 2011 |work=Mashable |author=Indvik, Lauren |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, a new Health Channel launched on TheAtlantic.com, incorporating coverage of food, as well as topics related to the mind, body, sex, family, and public health; its launch was overseen by Nicholas Jackson, who had previously been overseeing the Life channel and initially joined TheAtlantic.com to cover technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/atlantic-continues-expansion-health-channel-137022 |title='The Atlantic' Continues Expansion With Health Channel |work=AdWeek |accessdate=March 26, 2012 |date=December 13, 2011 |author=Moses, Lucia}}&lt;/ref&gt; TheAtlantic.com has also expanded to visual storytelling with the addition of the In Focus photo blog, curated by Alan Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mediabistro.com/mediajobsdaily/alan-taylor-jumps-to-the-atlantic_b5432 |date=January 19, 2011 |author=Kaufman, Rachel |title=Alan Taylor Jumps to The Atlantic |work=Media Bistro's Media Jobs Daily |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 it created its Video Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://allthingsd.com/20110804/the-atlantic-launches-a-video-aggregator-with-a-twist/ |title=The Atlantic Launches a Video Aggregator With a Twist |work=All Things D. |author=Kafka, Peter |date=August 4, 2011 |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially created as an aggregator, ''The Atlantic''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Video component, Atlantic Studios, has since evolved in an in-house production studio that create custom video series and original documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/The-Atlantic-Adapts-A-Legendary-Magazine-Meets-Online-Video-105232.aspx|title=The Atlantic Adapts: A Legendary Magazine Meets Online Video - Streaming Media Magazine|last=Dreier|first=Troy|work=Streaming Media Magazine|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary history==
[[File:Battle Hymn of the Republic.jpg|right|thumb|First publication of "Battle Hymn of the Republic"]]
A leading literary magazine, ''The Atlantic'' has published many significant works and authors. It was the first to publish pieces by the abolitionists [[Julia Ward Howe]] ("[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" on February 1, 1862), and [[William Parker (abolitionist)|William Parker]], whose [[slave narrative]], "The Freedman's Story" was published in February and March 1866. It also published [[Charles W. Eliot]]'s "The New Education", a call for practical reform, that led to his appointment to presidency of [[Harvard University]] in 1869; works by [[Charles Chesnutt]] before he collected them in ''[[The Conjure Woman]]'' (1899); and poetry and short stories, helping launch many national literary careers.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} For example, [[Emily Dickinson]], after reading an article in ''The Atlantic'' by [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], asked him to become her mentor.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In 2005, the magazine won a National Magazine Award for fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Esquire Wins 2005 National Magazine Award|url = http://www.hearst.com/newsroom/esquire-wins-2005-national-magazine-award|date = April 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1873 AtlanticMonthly TremontSt Boston.png|thumb|left|''Atlantic Monthly'' office, Ticknor &amp; Fields, 124 Tremont Street, Boston, ca.1868&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Directory'', 1868.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The magazine also published many of the works of [[Mark Twain]], including one that was lost until 2001.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Editors have recognized major cultural changes and movements. For example, of the emerging writers of the 1920s [[Ernest Hemingway]] found his [[Fifty Grand]] published in the July 1927 edition. And further along, the magazine published [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s defense of [[civil disobedience]] in "[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]" in August 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/04/martin-luther-kings-letter-from-birmingham-jail/274668/|title=Martin Luther King's 'Letter From Birmingham Jail'|author=The Editors|date=April 16, 2013|work=The Atlantic|volume=212|number=2|pages=78–88|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202162541/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/04/martin-luther-kings-letter-from-birmingham-jail/274668/|archivedate=December 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine has also published speculative articles that inspired the development of new technologies. The classic example is [[Vannevar Bush]]'s essay "[[As We May Think]]" (July 1945), which inspired [[Douglas Engelbart]] and later [[Ted Nelson]] to develop the modern [[workstation]] and [[hypertext]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reingold|first1=Howard|title=Tools For Thought Chapter 9: The Loneliness of a Long-Distance Thinker|url=http://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/09.html#Chap09|website=Tools for Thought|accessdate=29 January 2018|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalakov|first1=Georgi|title=The MEMEX of Vannevar Bush|url=http://history-computer.com/Internet/Dreamers/Bush.html|website=The History of Computers|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Atlantic Monthly'' founded the Atlantic Monthly Press in 1917; for many years, it was operated in partnership with [[Little, Brown and Company]] and published books including ''[[Drums Along the Mohawk (novel)|Drums Along the Mohawk]]'' and ''[[Blue Highways]]''. The press was sold in 1986; today it is an imprint of [[Grove Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Cohen| first = Roger| title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Small House to Buy Atlantic Monthly Press| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-05-13| date = 1991-06-24| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/24/business/the-media-business-small-house-to-buy-atlantic-monthly-press.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to publishing notable fiction and poetry, ''The Atlantic'' has emerged in the 21st century as an influential platform for [[Long-form journalism|longform]] storytelling and newsmaker interviews. Influential cover stories have included Anne Marie Slaughter's "Why Women Still Can't Have It All" (2012) and [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]]'s "Case for Reparations" (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/05/23/315279271/the-atlantics-ta-nehisi-coates-builds-a-case-for-reparations|title='The Atlantic's' Ta-Nehisi Coates Builds 'A Case For Reparations'|website=NPR.org|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Jeffrey Goldberg's "Obama Doctrine" was a widely discussed by American media and prompted response by many world leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/world/middleeast/obama-criticizes-the-free-riders-among-americas-allies.html|title=Obama Criticizes the ‘Free Riders’ Among America’s Allies|last=Landler|first=Mark|date=2016-03-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-26|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, writers and frequent contributors to the print magazine include [[James Fallows]], [[Jeffrey Goldberg]], [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]], Molly Ball, [[Caitlin Flanagan]], [[James Hamblin (physician)|James Hamblin]], [[Julia Ioffe]], [[Jonathan Rauch]], [[McKay Coppins]], Rosie Gray, Gillian White, Adrienne LaFrance, Vann Newkirk, Derek Thompson, [[David Frum]], [[Peter Beinart]], and James Parker.

Until recent decades, ''The Atlantic'' was known as a distinctively [[New England]] literary magazine (as opposed to ''[[Harper's]]'' and later ''[[The New Yorker]]'', both published in New York City). It achieved a national reputation and was important to the careers of many American writers and poets.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} By its third year, it was published by the noted Boston publishing house [[Ticknor and Fields]] (later to become part of [[Houghton Mifflin]]{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}), based in the city known for literary culture. The magazine was purchased in 1908 by its then editor, [[Ellery Sedgwick]], but remained in Boston.

In 1980, the magazine was acquired by [[Mortimer Zuckerman]], property magnate and founder of [[Boston Properties]], who became its chairman. On September 27, 1999, Zuckerman transferred ownership of the magazine to [[David G. Bradley]], owner of the [[National Journal Group]], which focused on news of Washington, D.C., and government. Bradley had promised that the magazine would stay in Boston for the foreseeable future, as it did for the next five and a half years.

In April 2005, however, the publishers announced that the editorial offices would be moved from their longtime home at 77 North Washington Street in Boston to join the company's advertising and circulation divisions in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="leaving city"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/04/15/atlantic_148_year_institution_leaving_city/|title=Atlantic, 148-year institution, leaving city: Magazine of Twain, James, Howells heads to capital|date=April 15, 2005|last2=Mehegan|first2=David|first1=Mark|last1=Feeney|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in August, Bradley told the ''[[New York Observer]]'' that the move was not made to save money — near-term savings would be $200,000–$300,000, a relatively small amount that would be swallowed by severance-related spending — but instead would serve to create a hub in Washington where the top minds from all of Bradley's publications could collaborate under the [[Atlantic Media Company]] umbrella. Few of the Boston staff agreed to move, and Bradley embarked on an open search for a new editorial staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Atlantic owner scours country for cinder-editor |newspaper=[[New York Observer]] |date=August 29 – September 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Bradley hired [[James Bennet (journalist)|James Bennet]] as editor-in-chief; he had been the Jerusalem bureau chief for ''[[The New York Times]]''. He also hired writers, including [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] and [[Andrew Sullivan]].&lt;ref name=Kurtz&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/05/AR2007080501576.html | title = The Atlantic's Owner Ponies Up | first1= Howard |last1=Kurtz | authorlink=Howard Kurtz | date = August 6, 2007 |work=The Washington Post | accessdate =August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Lauf joined the organization as publisher and vice-president in 2008; as of 2017, he was publisher and president of [[Quartz (publication)|''Quartz'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/a/masthead.mhtml |title=Atlantic masthead |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennet and Bob Cohn became co-presidents of ''The Atlantic'' in early 2014, and Cohn became the publication's sole president in March 2016 when Bennet was tapped to lead the New York Times editorial page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/archive/2016/03/bob-cohn-named-sole-president-of-the-atlantic/473610/|title=Bob Cohn Named Sole President of The Atlantic; James Bennet to Leadership Post at New York Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/business/media/james-bennet-will-lead-editorial-page-at-new-york-times.html|title=James Bennet Will Lead Editorial Page at New York Times|date=2016-03-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Goldberg was named editor in chief in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/archive/2016/10/jeffrey-goldberg-named-editor-in-chief-of-the-atlantic/503576/|title=Jeffrey Goldberg Named Editor in Chief of The Atlantic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2017, ''The Atlantic'' announced that multi-billionaire investor and philanthropist [[Laurene Powell Jobs]] (the widow of former [[Apple Inc.]] chairman and CEO [[Steve Jobs]]) had acquired majority ownership through her [[Emerson collective|Emerson Collective]] organization, with a staff member of Emerson Collective, Peter Lattman, being immediately named as ''The Atlantic'''s vice chairman. [[David G. Bradley]] and Atlantic Media retained a minority share position in this sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/business/media/atlantic-media-emerson-collective-majority-stake.html|title=Laurene Powell Jobs’s Organization to Take Majority Stake in The Atlantic|first=Sydney|last=Ember|date=July 28, 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Throughout its 159-year history, ''The Atlantic'' has been reluctant to recommend candidates in elections. In 1860, three years into publication, ''The Atlantic'''s then-editor [[James Russell Lowell]] endorsed [[Abraham Lincoln]] for his first run for president and also endorsed the [[abolition of slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Russell Lowell|Lowell, James Russell]], [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1860/10/the-election-in-november/306549/ "The Election in November"], ''The Atlantic'', November 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, 104 years later, [[Edward Weeks]] wrote on behalf of the editorial board in endorsing [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and rebuking [[Barry Goldwater]]'s candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;Weeks,
 Edward, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1964/10/the-1964-election/303598/ "The 1964 Election"], ''The Atlantic'', November 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the editorial board endorsed a presidential candidate, for the third time since the magazine's founding: Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]], in a rebuke of [[Donald Trump]]'s candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-case-for-hillary-clinton-and-against-donald-trump/501161/ "Against Donald Trump"], ''The Atlantic'', November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Wire''==
''The Wire'' (previously known as ''The Atlantic Wire'') was a sister site of TheAtlantic.com that aggregated news and opinions from online, print, radio, and television outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/the-atlantic-wire/ |work=Media Decoder Blog (The New York Times) |title=Atlantic Hits the Wire With Lots of Opinions |date=September 16, 2009 |author= Carr, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://mashable.com/2012/02/02/atlantic-wire-gabriel-snyder-interview |work=Mashable |title= What's Next for The Atlantic Wire |author=Indvik, Lauren |date=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CJR20090916"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://archives.cjr.org/the_kicker/more_on_the_atlantic_wire_they.php |work=Columbia Journalism Review |date=September 16, 2009 |author=Garber, Megan | title=More on The Atlantic: Wire They Aggregating?}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''The Atlantic Wire'' first launched in 2009, it curated [[op-ed]]s from across the media spectrum and summarized significant positions in each debate.&lt;ref name="CJR20090916"/&gt; Expanded to encompass news and original reporting, regular features include "What I Read", showcasing the [[media diet]]s of individuals from the worlds of entertainment, journalism, and politics, and "Trimming the Times",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/04/trimming-the-times-the-atlantic-wire-has-a-new-way-for-you-to-make-the-most-of-your-20-clicks/|author=Garber, Megan|title='Trimming the Times': The Atlantic Wire's new feature wants you to make the most of your 20 clicks |publisher=Nieman Journalism Lab |date=April 1, 2011|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a summary of the feature editor's choices of the best content in ''The New York Times''.

==''CityLab''==
CityLab (formerly ''The Atlantic Cities'') is the latest expansion of ''The Atlantic''{{'}}s digital properties, launched in September 2011. The stand-alone site has been described as exploring and explaining "the most innovative ideas and pressing issues facing today's global cities and neighborhoods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com|title=The Atlantic Cities |publisher=TheAtlanticCities.com |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was co-founded as ''The Atlantic Cities'' by Richard Florida, urban theorist, professor. In 2014, it was rebranded as CityLab.com. Today, CityLab.com's coverage areas include design, politics, crime, and housing. Among its offerings are Navigator, "a guide to urban life," and CityFixer, which curates solutions-based stories around a dozen topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Introducing CityLab.com: All Things Urban, from The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2014/05/introducing-citylabcom-all-things-urban-from-the-atlantic/371038/|publisher=''The Atlantic''|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
In June 2006, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' named ''The Atlantic'' one of the top ten English-language magazines, describing it as "a gracefully aging ... 150-year-old granddaddy of periodicals" because "it keeps us smart and in the know" with cover stories on the then-forthcoming fight over ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. It also lauded regular features such as "Word Fugitives" and "Primary Sources" as "cultural barometers."&lt;ref&gt;"50 Best Magazines," ''Chicago Tribune,'' June 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2013, ''The Atlantic''{{'}}s website published "[[Native advertising|sponsor content]]" about [[David Miscavige]], the leader of the [[Church of Scientology]]. While the magazine had previously published advertising looking like articles, this one was widely criticized. The page comments were moderated by the marketing team, not by editorial staff; comments critical of the church were being removed while comments praising the church were being downvoted by readers. Later that day, ''The Atlantic'' removed the piece from its website and issued an apology.&lt;ref name="Apology"&gt;[https://www.magnetmail.net/actions/email_web_version.cfm?recipient_id=699462885&amp;message_id=2459857&amp;user_id=NJG_Atlan&amp;group_id=0&amp;jobid=12656579 Statement from The Atlantic], Natalie Raabe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;[[Erik Wemple|Wemple, Erik]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/01/15/the-atlantics-scientology-problem-start-to-finish/ "The Atlantic's Scientology problem, start to finish"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blog, January 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;[[Brian Stelter|Stelter, Brian]], and Christine Haughney, [http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/the-atlantic-apologizes-for-scientology-ad/?_r=0 "The Atlantic Apologizes for Scientology Ad"], January 15, 2013, ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Renart illumination.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An illumination of the tale from a mediaeval manuscript]]
"'''The Taill of Schir Chanticleir and the Foxe'''" is '''Fabill 3''' of [[Robert Henryson]]'s cycle of thirteen ''[[The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian#Fabill 3|Morall Fabillis]]'' composed in Scotland in the later fifteenth century. It is the first of the fabillis in the poem to be based on [[Reynard]]ian and [[beast epic]] sources rather than on any strictly [[Aesop]]ian original, although the closest match from Aesop might be ''The Dog, the Cock and the Fox''. 

One of its most direct known sources is [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Nun's Priest's Tale|Nun's Priest's Tale]]'' from the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' written perhaps around ninety years earlier. It might also be argued that Henryson was acquainted with the earlier extended telling of the story in the [[Reynard cycle]]. Chanticleir, for example, has three wives, as in the earlier French romance, where Chaucer gives seven to his Chauntecleer.

Henryson's version was probably composed sometime around the 1480s.

==Fabill==

Schir [[Lawrence (given name)|Lowrence]], a fox ''full sair hungrie,'' creeps one morning early into the farmyard which neighbours the ''thornie [[woodland|schaw]] of grit defence'' which is ''his residence.'' He stalks Chanticleir, a cockerel owned by a poor [[widow|wedow]] highly dependant on her small flock of hens. Pretending he has come to serve Chanticleir, Lowrence uses flattery to praise the bird's voice and trick him into singing on tiptoe with his eyes closed in the manner, supposedly, of his father who he claims also to have served. So close a ''freind'' (''[[sic]]'') he was to the bird's father that the tod was present at his death to ''hald his [[head|heid]] and gif him drinkis warme ... syne [say] the [[Office for the Dead|dirigie]] quhen that he wes deid.'' This complex web of flattery and highly ambiguous assurance persuades Chanticleir to perform the foolish act, allowing Lowrence swiftly to ''[[wikt:seize|hint]] him be the throte'' and ''[[running|hy]]'' with him to the wood. 

Hearing the resultant commotion of the flock, the widow discovers the theft and faints. There is then a brief excursus as the three hens in Chanticleir's [[harem]], Pertok, Sprutok and Toppok, deliver rhetorical responses on the loss of their husband. Pertok eulogises the cock and laments his death, but Sprutok counters this with a strong critical condemnation of the cock, advising Pertok simply to forget him now that he is gone; counsel which persuades Pertok to alter her memory of Chanticleir and resolve, before the week is out, to ''get ane berne'' (man) ''suld better [[Sexual reproduction|claw oure breik]]'' (line 529). Finally Toppok, ''lyke ane [[cleric|curate]],'' preaches a ''sermon full crous'' which pronounces the cockerel's destruction as no more than his just and inevitable reward due to his failure to [[repent]] his sexual venality. 

But Chanticleir is not dead yet. The widow, recovering from her swoon, calls on her troupe of dogs to ''reskew my nobill cok [[Wiktionary:ere|or]] he be slane.'' Chanticleir takes the opportunity of the pursuit of the widow's ''kennetis'' (hounds) and Lowrence's physical exhaustion to persuade the fox ''[[telepathy|in mynd]]'' (line 556) to turn briefly and assure the dogs that he and the cock are friends. Taken in by this, he opens his mouth to call back enabling Chanticleir to escape into a tree. Lowrence tries a second time to persuade Chanticleir to come to him, but the cock is not fooled twice. Thus Lowrence still goes hungry, while Chanticleir 

:''...over the feildis tuke his flicht''
:''And in at the wedowis [[louver|lewer]] couth he licht.'' (lines 584-5)

What Chanticleir's three wives make of his return is left to the reader's imagination.

==Moralitas==
[[File:Vulpes vulpes laying in snow.jpg|right|260px|thumb|''...creip on my [[stomach|wame]] in froist and [[snow|snaw]]...'' (lines 457-8)]]

The moralitas opens with an observation that the taill is ''overheillit wyth [[Type (metaphysics)|typis]] figurall'' (replete with symbolic meanings). It focusses, however, on one basic message, the sin of pride and the dangers of flattery, expressed in forceful [[alliterative]] verse: 

:''Fy, puft-up pryde ! Thow is full poysonabill !''
:''Quha favoris [[Wiktionary:thee|the]] on force [[Wiktionary:must|man]] haif ane fall:''
:''Thy strenth is nocht, thy stule standis unstabill;''
:''Tak witnes of the feyndis infernall,''
:''Quhilk [[War in Heaven#Fallen angels|houndit doun wes fra that hevinlie hall]]''
:''To hellis hole, and to that hiddeous hous,''
:''Because in pryde thay wer presumpteous...''
(lines 593-99)

while the foxe, we are told, ''may weill'' represent  flatterers 

:''With fals mening and mynd maist toxicate...''
(line 602).

Despite the forceful rhethoric, the simplicity of the message is qualified and undercut by the writer's admissions that the full range of readings is more complex. In contrast to the relatively plain statement of the moral to the previous fabill (''[[The Taill of the Uponlandis Mous and the Burges Mous#Moralitas|The Twa Mice]]'') Henryson is starting to complicate his inferences. We are not to take the narrator's moralitates as a complete picture.

==Structure and sources==

The poem makes a human and [[Existentialism|existential]] drama out of a simple act of animal predation and ultimately can only be comic or absurd. The first known example of this narrative idea, exploited for full ironic effect in the genre, is Chaucer's [[mock heroic]] ''Nun's Priest's Tale'' which Henryson almost certainly used as a source. Chaucer also featured in his poem a long and profoundly comic set of [[excursus]]es on dream prediction delivered by the (well-read) victim of the farmyard crime. Henryson's version, which is shorter and more concise, sticks chiefly to the main action but still maintains the complexity of effect which Chaucer demonstrated was possible. 

The ''Talking of the Tod'' opens with a short general prologue (two stanzas) which highlights the [[instinct|instinct-led]] nature of creatures in the animal kingdom while acknowledging their enormous [[biodiversity|diversity]].

A similar set of three [[Romulus (fabulist)|verse Romulus]] stories can be identified in the second half of the poem occupying a position that strongly mirrors the first trio in terms of organisation, though the latter three are not manifestly linked in terms of narrative.

==Numbers==
The fabill is 27 stanzas; the moralitas is 4 stanzas: 

* 27 + 4 = 31

The action of the fabill itself can be further broken down thus: 

* Part 1 (stalking Chanticleir) — 14 stanzas (of which Lowrence and Chanticleir's dialogue = 7 stanzas)
* Part 2 (disputation between the hens) — 7 stanzas
* Part 3 (denouement; Chanticleir's escape) — 6 stanzas

It is worshipped by Buddhists. The sacred fig is also venerated in Hinduism and Jainism.]]

'''Trees''' are significant in many of the world's [[mythology|mythologies]] and [[religion]]s, and have been given deep and sacred meanings throughout the ages. Human beings, observing the growth and death of [[tree]]s, and the annual death and revival of their foliage,&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Tree-Worship |volume=27 |page=235 |inline=1 |first=Stanley Arthur |last=Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Teutonic Peoples |volume=26 |page=685}}&lt;/ref&gt; have often seen them as powerful symbols of growth, death and rebirth. Evergreen trees, which largely stay green throughout these cycles, are sometimes considered symbols of the eternal, [[immortality]] or [[fertility]]. The image of the [[Tree of life]] or [[world tree]] occurs in many mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Norns |volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacred or symbolic trees include the [[banyan]] and the sacred fig (''[[Ficus religiosa]]'') in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. In [[folk religion]] and [[folklore]], trees are often said to be the homes of [[tree spirit]]s. [[Sacred trees and groves in Germanic paganism and mythology|Germanic mythology]] as well as [[Celtic polytheism]] both appear to have involved cultic practice in [[sacred grove]]s, especially grove of [[oak]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, John W. (1979). ''Tree Worship'', in Mankind Quarterly,  Sept., pp. 79-142. {{ISSN|0025-2344}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[druid]]'' itself possibly derives from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic word]] for oak. The [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]] mentions [[Ficus sycomorus|sycamores]] as part of the scenery where the soul of the deceased finds blissful repose.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer 1984:13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trees are an attribute of the archetypical ''[[locus amoenus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=locus amoenus|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100111979|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wishing trees==
{{Main|Wish Tree}}

In many parts of the world travelers have observed the custom of hanging objects upon trees in order to establish some sort of a relationship between themselves and the tree. Throughout [[Europe]], trees are known as sites of pilgrimages, ritual ambulation, and the recital of ([[Christian]]) prayers. Wreaths, ribbons or rags are suspended to win favor for sick humans or livestock, or merely for good luck. Popular belief associates the sites with healing, bewitching, or mere wishing.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

In [[South America]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] recorded a tree honored by numerous offerings (rags, meat, cigars, etc.); libations were made to it, and horses were sacrificed.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/29/4.html "The Voyage of the Beagle"], Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

==World tree==
{{Main|World tree}}
[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|[[Yggdrasil]], the [[world tree|World Ash]] of [[Norse mythology]]]]

The world tree, with its branches reaching up into the sky, and roots deep into the earth, can be seen to dwell in three worlds - a link between heaven, the earth, and the underworld, uniting above and below. This great tree acts as an [[Axis mundi]], supporting or holding up the cosmos, and providing a link between the heavens, earth, and underworld. In European mythology, the best-known example is the tree [[Yggdrasil]] from [[Norse mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Mountfort 2003:41, 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and folklore==

Numerous [[oral tradition|popular stories]] throughout the world reflect a firmly-rooted belief in an intimate connection between a [[human being]] and a [[tree]], [[plant]] or [[flower]]. Sometimes a man's life depends upon the tree and suffers when it withers or is injured, and we encounter the idea of the external soul, already found in the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian ''[[Tale of Two Brothers]]'' from at least 3000 years ago. Here one of the brothers leaves his heart on the top of the flower of the acacia and falls dead when it is cut down. Sometimes, however, the tree is a mysterious token which shows its sympathy with an absent hero by weakening or dying, as the man becomes ill or loses his life. These two features very easily combine, and they agree in representing to us mysterious sympathy between tree and human life.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Sometimes the new-born child is associated with a newly planted tree with which its life is supposed to be bound up; or, on ceremonial occasions (betrothal, marriage, ascent to the throne), a personal relationship of this kind is instituted by planting trees, upon the fortunes of which the career of the individual depends. Sometimes, boughs or plants are selected and the individual draws omens of life and death. Again, a person will put themselves into relationship with a tree by depositing upon it something which has been in close contact with them, such as hair or clothing.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Often a tree will be associated with [[oracles]]. The oak of [[Dodona]] was tended by priests who slept on the ground. Forms of the tall oaks of the old [[Prussia]]ns were inhabited by gods who gave responses, and so numerous are the examples that the old [[Hebrew]] [[terebinth]] of the teacher, and the terebinth of the diviners may reasonably be placed in this category. Important sacred trees are also the object of pilgrimage, one of the most noteworthy being the branch of the [[Bo tree]] at [[Sri Lanka]] brought thither before the Christian era. The tree spirits will hold sway over the surrounding forest or district, and the animals in the locality are often sacred and must not be harmed.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The custom of transferring disease or sickness from men to trees is well known. Sometimes the hair, nails, clothing, etc. of a sickly person are fixed to a tree, or they are forcibly inserted in a hole in the trunk, or the tree is split and the patient passes through the aperture. Where the tree has been thus injured, its recovery and that of the patient are often associated. Different explanations may be found of such customs which naturally take rather different forms among peoples in different grades.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

In Arab folklore, sacred trees are haunted by [[jinn]]; sacrifices are made, and the sick who sleep beneath them receive prescriptions in their dreams. Here, as frequently elsewhere, it is dangerous to pull a bough. This dread of damaging special trees is familiar: [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] instructed the woodman to sacrifice to the male or female deity before thinning a grove, while in the [[Homeric poems|Homeric poem]] to Aphrodite the tree nymph is wounded when the tree is injured, and dies when the trunk falls.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Early Buddhism held that trees had neither mind nor feeling and might lawfully be cut; but it recognized that certain spirits might reside in them, such as [[Nang Takian]] in [[Thailand]]. Propitiation is made before the axe is laid to the holy trees; loss of life or of wealth and the failure of rain are feared should they be wantonly cut; there are even trees which it is dangerous to climb. The Talein of [[Burma]] prays to the tree before he cuts it down, and the [[Africa]]n woodman will place a fresh sprig upon the tree.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Some [[Ancient India]]n [[tree deity|tree deities]], such as Puliyidaivalaiyamman, the [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] deity of the [[tamarind|tamarind tree]], or Kadambariyamman, associated with the [[kadamba tree]] were seen as manifestations of a goddess who offers her blessings by giving fruits in abundance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/nature_trees.htm Mythical Trees and Deities]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred trees==
[[File:Sefan and tree.jpg|thumb|upright|210px|[[Stephen of Perm]] takes an axe to a [[birch]] hung with pelts and cloths that is sacred to the [[Komi peoples|Komi]] of [[Great Perm]] in the years after 1383&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth 1992:5f.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Trees were often regarded as sacred in the ancient world, throughout Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Gorshunova. Olga V. (2008). ''Svjashennye derevja Khodzhi Barora…'', ('' Sacred Trees of Khodzhi Baror: Phytolatry and the Cult of Female Deity in Central Asia'') in Etnoragraficheskoe Obozrenie,  n° 1, pp. 71-82. {{ISSN|0869-5415}}. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity and [[Islam]] treated the worship of trees as idolatry and this led to their destruction in Europe and most of West Asia.

===Europe===

The [[Glastonbury Thorn]] in Glastonbury, England is a small ''[[Crataegus monogyna]]'' regarded as sacred by many Christians. It is said to have sprouted miraculously from the staff of the early Christian figure [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. Of further religious significance and indeed scientific interest, the tree displays a rare phenomenon for its species, blooming not once but twice per year. The second bloom occurs around the holiday of [[Christmas]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===South Asia===
[[File:Worship of a sacred tree, Kumbh Mela 2013, Allahabad.jpg|thumb|260px|Honoring a sacred tree during Paush Purnima, [[Kumbh Mela]], [[Allahabad]] (India)]]
Sacred trees remain common in India. They are found in villages, in the countryside and the heart of some temples (e.g. [[Jain temple]]s). Shripad Vaidya of [[Nagpur]], [[Maharashtra]] has been dubbed an "eco-worship center" (''Nakshatravan''). It is the first in the world and is known for worship of the environment through plants. The Indian [[shastra]]s and ''panchang''  mention several ways of doing so, one of them being to offer prayers to various trees. There is even a belief in [[yaksha|yakshas or yakshis]], or nature spirits, who may dwell in trees or other natural places. By worshipping trees in which yakshas may inhabit, people seek to placate the spirits and bring health and prosperity into their lives. This is often done by placing incense and candles at the root of the tree or performing "tree [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]". Sometimes the statues of deities and [[nāga]]s may be nestled in between the roots since the tree grants the deity's [[murti]] shade and protection.&lt;ref&gt;A green act of faith - ''Times Of India''

&lt;/ref&gt;

In both [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], Buddhists venerate the [[Bodhi Tree]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bo-Tree |volume=4 |page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Bodh Gaya]]. It is said to have protected [[Gautama Buddha]] when he was meditating to attain [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. The Bodhi Tree symbolizes enlightenment and wisdom and people may continue to meditate under it in order to obtain buddhahood.

Besides the sacred Bodhi trees of Buddhism the veneration of certain [[spirit]]s related to trees, known generically as ''[[Nang Mai]]'', is common in [[Thai folklore]]. The most well-known of these tree spirits is ''[[Nang Ta-khian]]'' which according to [[Thailand|Thai]] [[oral tradition]]&lt;ref name="Phi"&gt;[http://www.thaiworldview.com/bouddha/animism5.htm Spirits]&lt;/ref&gt; inhabits ''[[Hopea odorata]]'' trees and may appear as a beautiful woman wearing traditional Thai attire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tumnandd.com/wp-content/uploads/takien.jpg Nang Ta-khian image]&lt;/ref&gt; Trees, logs, beams or keels of wooden boats where the spirit is deemed to reside are an object of pilgrimage and have lengths of colored silk tied as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.tlcthai.com/news/41148.html 9-year old asked Lady Ta-khian for help (Thai)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409140344/http://news.tlcthai.com/news/41148.html |date=2014-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In present times ''Nang Ta-Khian'' is usually propitiated in order to be lucky in the [[lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.mthai.com/blog/32621.html 10 อันดับ สถานที่ขอหวย ที่ฮิตมากที่สุด ในประเทศไทย]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===

In the [[Avestan]] literature and [[Iranian mythology]], there is several sacred vegetal icons related to life, eternality and cure, like: [[Amesha Spenta]] [[Amordad]] (guardian of plants, goddess of trees and immortality), [[Gaokerena]] (or white [[Haoma]], a tree that its vivacity would certify continuance of life in universe), Bas tokhmak (a tree with remedial attribute, retentive of all herbal seeds, and destroyer of sorrow), [[Mashya and Mashyana|Mashyа and Mashyane]] (parents of the human race in Iranian myths), [[Barsom]] (copped offshoots of pomegranate, gaz or [[Haoma]] that Zoroastrians use in their rituals), [[Haoma]] (a plant, unknown today, that was source of sacred potable), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://jfava.ut.ac.ir/article_36319.html |title = Plant of life, in Ancient Iran, Mesopotamia &amp; Egypt |date = 2013|publisher = Tehran: Honarhay-e Ziba Journal, Vol. 18, No. 2, p. 15. |last = Taheri|first = Sadreddin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the world's ancient belief systems also include the belief of sacred groves, where trees are revered and respected and there are priests and priestesses attending to them who also serve as guardians, preventing those who wish to tear down the trees by means of ancient magic and elaborate protection rituals.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==In literature==
[[File:Thunchath Smarakam (13).jpg|thumbnail|A temple in India with the sacred [[banyan]] Tree]]
* In literature, a mythology was developed by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], his [[Two Trees of Valinor]] playing a central role in his [[mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] cosmogony. Tolkien's 1964 ''[[Tree and Leaf]]'' combines the allegorical tale ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]'' and his essay ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]''. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the [[White Tree of Gondor]] stands as a symbol of Gondor in the Court of the Fountain in [[Minas Tirith]].
* [[W. B. Yeats]] describes a "holy tree" in his poem "The Two Trees" (1893). 
* In George R.R. Martin's ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, one of the main religions, that of "the old gods" or "the gods of the North", involves sacred groves of trees ("godswoods") with a white tree with red leaves at the center known as the "heart tree".

== In film and TV ==
* In the sixth (third chronologically) ''[[Star Wars]]'' film, ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', the [[Ewok]]s worship trees on the [[forest moon of Endor]]{{fact|date=October 2017}}.
* In the [[Fictional universe of Avatar|fictional universe]] of the film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'',  the [[Pandoran biosphere#List of flora|Pandoran biosphere]] habitates trees, which are of fundamental importance for the [[Pandoran biosphere#Naʼvi|Na'vi]] people, like the Hometrees, the Tree of Souls and the Tree of Voices as well as Woodsprites.
* In the TV series ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]'', an element of the plot is the Nemeton, a sacred tree from which druids draw power through human sacrifices, and which later acts as a beacon, drawing supernatural entities to the nearby town of Beacon Hills.

'''w00tstock''' is a touring [[variety show]] billed as "3 Hours of Geeks &amp; Music". It was created in 2009 by [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Adam Savage]] and [[Paul and Storm]].&lt;ref&gt;Austin L. Ray. [http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2010/06/w00tstock-moments.html "Five Reasons Why You Should Go to w00tstock".] ''[[Paste Magazine]]'', 19 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denmead, Ken (October 20, 2009). [http://archive.wired.com/geekdad/2009/10/w00tstock-ftw/ "W00tstock FTW!".] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]: Geek Dad''.
&lt;/ref&gt; The first shows took place in 2009 in [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]], and as of July 2015, a total of 20 shows had been presented.

The name is a play on words combining [[Woodstock]], the notable 1969 [[counterculture]] music festival, and [[w00t]], a piece of internet slang that expresses excitement.

==The versions==
Though the headliners for the show are [[Adam Savage]], [[Wil Wheaton]], and [[Paul and Storm]], each evening’s performance includes a different group of special guests and is subtitled with a different version number.
