An '''affair''' is a [[sexual relationship]], [[romantic friendship]], or [[Passion (emotion)|passionate attachment]] between two people without the attached person's [[significant other]] knowing.

==Romantic affair==
[[File:Jean-Honoré Fragonard - The Stolen Kiss.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Stolen Kiss (Fragonard)|The Stolen Kiss]]'' by [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]]]
A romantic affair, also called an affair of the heart, may refer to sexual liaisons among unwed or wedded parties, or to various forms of [[forms of nonmonogamy|nonmonogamy]]. Unlike a [[casual relationship]], which is a physical and emotional relationship between two people who may [[having sex|have sex]] without expecting a more formal romantic relationship, an affair is by its nature romantic.
Affair may also describe part of an agreement within an [[open marriage|open marriage or open relationship]], such as [[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinging]], [[dating]], or [[polyamory]], in which some forms of [[extramarital sex|sex with one's non-primary partner(s)]] are permitted and other forms are not. Participants in open relationships, including unmarried couples and polyamorous families, may consider sanctioned affairs the norm, but when a non-sanctioned affair occurs, it is described as [[infidelity]] and may be experienced as [[adultery]], or a [[betrayal]] both of [[trust (sociology)|trust]] and [[integrity]], even though to most people it would not be considered "illicit".

When a romantic affair lacks both overt and covert sexual behavior and yet exhibits intense or enduring emotional intimacy it may be referred to as an emotional affair, platonic love, or a romantic friendship.

=={{anchor|extramarital affair}} Extramarital affair==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Tess]], from [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] and from [[Lives in the Shadow with J. Krishnamurti]]--&gt;
{{main|Infidelity|Legitimacy (family law)|Adultery|Extramarital sex}}
Extramarital affairs are relationships outside of [[marriage]] where an illicit [[romantic love|romantic]] or [[human sexuality|sexual]] relationship or a [[romantic friendship]] or [[passion (emotion)|passion]]ate attachment occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extramarital|title=Definition of EXTRAMARITAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Affair that continues in one form or another for years, even as one of the partners to that affair passes through marriage, divorce and remarriage, could be considered the primary relationship and the marriages secondary to it. Several people claim the reason of extra marital affair as their unsuccessful marriage and that both spouses failed to please each other. This may be serial polygamy or other [[forms of nonmonogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strean|first1=Herbert S.|title=The Extramarital Affair|date=1980|publisher=Free Press|accessdate=18 November 2015|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Extramarital_Affair.html?id=iDnWSAfBnnUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to pursue serial and clandestine extramarital affairs while safeguarding other secrets and [[conflict of interest]] inherent in the practice, requires skill in [[deception]] and duplicitous [[negotiation (process)|negotiation]]. Even to hide one affair requires a degree of skill or malicious [[gaslighting]]. All these behaviors are more usually called [[lie|lying]].{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

Deception can be defined as the "[[covert]] manipulation of perception to alter thoughts, feelings, or beliefs". The presence of deception may indicate the degree to which the deceiver has breached fundamental conditions of [[fidelity]], of reciprocal [[vulnerability]] and of [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]]. Sometimes these are explicit or assumed pre-conditions of a committed [[intimacy|intimate]] relationship.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

Individuals having affairs with married men or women can be prosecuted for adultery in some jurisdictions and can be sued by the jilted spouses in others,&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/hate-the-husband-sue-the_b_311419.html |title=Hate the Husband? Sue the Mistress! |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2009-10-07|accessdate=2010-03-01 |first=Jacob M. |last=Appel}}&lt;/ref&gt; or named as 'co-respondent' in divorce proceedings. As of 2009, eight U.S.&amp;nbsp;states permitted such [[alienation of affections]] lawsuits.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt;

==Online affair==
The appearance of [[computer-mediated communication]] introduces a new type of communication and consequently a new type of "affair". There are various kinds of computer-mediated communication that differ in some significant aspects: one-to-one or group communication formats, interrelating with anonymous or identified people, and communicating in synchronous or asynchronous formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ze'ev|title=Flirting On and Offline|journal=International Journal of Research in to New Media Technologies|year=2004|volume=10|issue=24|url=http://con.sagepub.com/content/10/1/24.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online affairs combine features of close and remote relationships. 

Ben Ze'ef argues that an online affair is a unique kind of affair—termed "detached attachment", or just "detachment"—that includes opposing features whose presence in a face-to-face affair would be paradoxical. Like direct, face-to-face affairs, online affairs can be spontaneous and casual and show intensive personal involvement. However, online affairs can also be more of a planned discourse than spontaneous talk; like written letters, online messages can be stored and thus have permanent presence, which is absent from face-to-face affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lea &amp; Spears|title=Love at first Byte|journal=Understudied Relationships|year=1995|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

People participating in online affairs may be strangers to each other in the sense that they have never actually met each other. However, they are also close to each other since they share intimate information. In online affairs, people try to enjoy the benefits of both close and remote affairs, while avoiding their flaws. People enjoy the highly valued products of close affairs while paying the low cost of remote affairs. As one woman wrote: 'He constantly told me that he can not provide me with what I would want and I would always respond with: "I'm not asking anything from you, but simply enjoy your company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cyberlove101.com, story 39|title=An Enchanting Belgian gentleman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6415">'''Ariadne's thread''', named for the legend of [[Ariadne]], is the solving of a problem with multiple apparent means of proceeding - such as a physical [[maze]], a [[logic puzzle]], or an [[ethical dilemma]] - through an exhaustive application of logic to all available routes.  It is the particular method used that is able to follow completely through to trace steps or take point by point a series of found truths in a contingent, ordered search that reaches an end position.  This process can take the form of a mental record, a physical marking, or even a philosophical debate; it is the process itself that assumes the name.

==Implementation==
The key element to applying Ariadne's thread to a problem is the creation and maintenance of a record - physical or otherwise - of the problem's available and exhausted options at all times.  This record is referred to as the "thread", regardless of its actual medium.  The purpose the record serves is to permit [[backtracking]] - that is, reversing earlier decisions and trying alternatives.  Given the record, applying the [[algorithm]] is straightforward:

* At any moment that there is a choice to be made, make one arbitrarily from those not already marked as failures, and follow it logically as far as possible.
* If a contradiction results, back up to the last decision made, mark it as a failure, and try another decision at the same point.  If no other options exist there, back up to the last place in the record that does, mark the failure at that level, and proceed onward.

This algorithm will terminate upon either finding a solution or marking all initial choices as failures; in the latter case, there is no solution.  If a thorough examination is desired even though a solution has been found, one can revert to the previous decision, mark the success, and continue on as if a solution were         never found; the algorithm will exhaust all decisions and find all solutions.

==Distinction from trial and error==
The terms "Ariadne's thread" and "[[trial and error]]" are often used interchangeably, which is not necessarily correct.  They have two distinctive differences:

* "Trial and error" implies that each "trial" yields some particular value to be studied and improved upon, removing "errors" from each iteration to enhance the quality of future trials.  Ariadne's thread has no such mechanism, and hence all decisions made are arbitrary.  For example, the [[scientific method]] is trial and error; puzzle-solving is Ariadne's thread.
* Trial-and-error approaches are rarely concerned with how ''many'' solutions may exist to a problem, and indeed often assume only one correct solution exists.  Ariadne's thread makes no such assumption, and is capable of locating all possible solutions to a purely logical problem.

In short, trial and error ''approaches'' a desired solution; Ariadne's thread blindly exhausts the search space completely, finding any and all solutions.  Each has its appropriate distinct uses.  They can be employed in tandem - for example, although the editing of a Wikipedia article is arguably a trial-and-error process (given how in theory it approaches an ideal state), article histories provide the record for which Ariadne's thread may be applied, reverting detrimental edits and restoring the article back to the most recent error-free version, from which other options may be attempted.

==Applications==
Obviously, Ariadne's thread may be applied to the solving of mazes in the same manner as the legend; an actual thread can be used as the record, or chalk or a similar marker can be applied to label passages.  If the maze is on paper, the thread may well be a pencil.

Logic problems of all natures may be resolved via Ariadne's thread, the maze being but an example.  At present, it is most prominently applied to ''[[Sudoku]]'' puzzles, used to attempt values for as-yet-unsolved cells.  The medium of the thread for puzzle-solving can vary widely, from a pencil to numbered chits to a computer program, but all accomplish the same task.  Note that as the compilation of Ariadne's thread is an [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] process, and due to its exhaustiveness leaves no room for actual study, it is largely frowned upon as a solving method, to be employed only as a last resort when [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] methods fail.

Artificial intelligence is heavily dependent upon Ariadne's thread when it comes to game-playing, most notably in programs which play [[chess]]; the possible moves are the decisions, game-winning states the solutions, and game-losing states failures.  Due to the massive depth of many games, most algorithms cannot afford to apply Ariadne's thread ''entirely'' on every move due to time constraints, and therefore work in tandem with a [[heuristic]] that evaluates game states and limits a [[breadth-first search]] only to those that are most likely to be beneficial, a trial-and-error process.

Even circumstances where the concept of "solution" is not so well defined have had Ariadne's thread applied to them, such as navigating the [[World Wide Web]], making sense of patent law, and in philosophy; "Ariadne's Thread" is a popular name for websites of many purposes, but primarily for those that feature philosophical or ethical debate.

'''Bonnie Myotai Treace''' is the founder and teacher of Hermitage Heart; she leads a program of training in Garrison, New York and Asheville, North Carolina. She is particularly known for her work in women's spirituality, poetry, and the nexus of mind and environment. Myotai was the first [[Dharma]] successor of [[John Daido Loori]], [[Rōshi|Roshi]], in the [[Mountains and Rivers Order]], having received shiho, dharma transmission, from him in 1996. Serving and training for over two decades eventually as  vice-abbot of [[Zen Mountain Monastery]], she was the establishing teacher and first abbess of the Zen Center of New York City. At the Monastery she was the first director of [[Dharma Communications]], editor of ''Mountain Record'', and in charge of the affiliates of the Mountains and Rivers Order. 

Treace holds an advanced degree in literature, was a lobbyist for women's issues, and an analyst with the Potomac Research Institute specializing in hydromechanics. 

In 2016 Myotai gave shiho or dharma transmission to Phil Sengetsu Kolman, Sensei, and named John Kyoman Weiczorek as Dharma Steward of Hermitage Heart.


Treace is the author of several books, among them: "Winter Moon: A Season of Zen," and "Empty Branches." She's also had chapters in  "Water: Its Spiritual Significance" (Vons Fitae Press),  ''The Art of Just Sitting: Essential Writings on the Zen Practice of Shikantaza'', and "Lotus Moon: The Poetry of Rengetsu", along with many other writings. Myotai's teachings have appeared in various Buddhist publications, including Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly, The Mountain Record and in several editions of The Best Buddhist Writing.  She is a member of the [[American Zen Teachers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loori&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seager, 257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prebish, 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcnr.com/news/2006/0913/General_Stories/017.html Zen Meditation And Dharma Talk on "Koans Of Water" to be Held at St. Mary's&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CruzzersChakana.jpg|thumb|right]]
The '''chakana''' (or '''Inca Cross''') is a stepped cross made up of an equal-armed cross indicating the cardinal points of the compass and a superimposed square. The square is suggested to represent the other two levels of existence. The three levels of existence are ''Hana Pacha'' (the upper world inhabited by the superior gods), ''Kay Pacha'', (the world of our everyday existence) and ''Ukhu'' or ''Urin Pacha'' (the underworld inhabited by spirits of the dead, the ancestors, their overlords and various deities having close contact to the Earth plane). The hole through the centre of the cross is the Axis by means of which the shaman transits the cosmic vault to the other levels.  It is also said to represent [[Cusco]], the center of the [[Incan Empire|Incan empire]], and the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] constellation.

==Composition==
The geometry of the symbol has a high degree of [[symmetry]]. The symbol can be drawn from a circle. A square is inscribed in the circle, with the corners tangent to the circle. This forms the "middle step" of the ladder. A smaller square (tilted 45 degrees) is made from the midpoints of the large square. Connecting the midpoints of the small square and extending the lines to the edge of the circle will form the arms of the cross, otherwise known as the "first" and "last" steps of the chakana. Lines are drawn from the points the lines exit the circle, to complete the cross. A small circle is made from the diameter of the cross lines. To proof the construction, a separate construction line is drawn from the point where the square corners with the cross rectangles to the same point on the opposite side. If the line is 27 degrees from the vertical, the chakana is properly drawn.

==Historical evidence==
The [[mestee]] historian [[Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler)|Garcilaso de la Vega, ''el Ynga'']], reports about a  holy cross of white and red marble or [[jasper]], which was venerated in 16th-century [[Cusco]]{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. The cross had been kept in a royal house, in a sacred place or ''[[huaca|wak'a]]'', but the Incas did not worship it. They simply admired it because of its beauty. The cross was square (''quadrada''), measuring about two by two feet, its branches three inch wide, the edges carefully squared and the surface brightly polished.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The Incas began to venerate the holy cross, after they heard how [[Pedro de Candia]] had miraculously defied a lion and a tiger holding a cross. When the Spaniards captured the city, they transferred the cross to sacristy of the newly built cathedral, where De la Vega saw it in 1560. He was surprised that the clergy had not decorated it with gold or gems.&lt;ref&gt;Garcillago de la Vega, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WcVoauZVaFEC&amp;pg=PA111 First part of the Royal Commentaries of the Yncas], 1869, repr. Cambridge 2010, vol. 1, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; As we know from Middle America, this may have been part of a deliberate strategy by [[Mendicant orders|mendicant friars]], trying to adapt to indigenous cultural codes. As a rule, the veneration of the holy cross was a carefully designed ecclesiastical enterprise, incorporating native symbols and reproducing them on sacral level. Most surviving Meso-American crosses do not predate the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mónica Domínguez Torres, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q_b3sg-tLvQC Military Ethos and Visual Culture in Post-Conquest Mexico], Burlington 2013, pp. 61-110&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing stories about indigenous crosses contributed to the idea of a [[Natural theology|'natural' religion]] that would have prepared the Indians for their inevitable conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Ditchfield, ‘What Did Natural History Have to Do with Salvation? José de Acosta SJ (1540-1600) in the America's', in: Peter Clarke and Tony Claydon, God's Bounty? The Churches and the Natural World, Woodbridge, Suffolk and Rochester, NY 2010, pp. 144-168&lt;/ref&gt;

Actually, this Andean "cross" has been documented in Tiwanaku architecture (Bolivia) dating back to 300 BC and AD 300. Other Andean cultures, Mapuche, whose presence in the Americas also predates Western presence and date back 600 t 500 BC.

==Controversy==

The "chakana" is an invented tradition. Although the Chakana as the 'Andean cross', presented as an Inca and pre-Inca symbol bearing cultural, spiritual, or mystical interpretations as expressed in this article, has wide popularity in contemporary Andean culture, its roots are no older than the late 20th century, and the popular version, than 2003. The current Chakana mythos as it impacts the New Age belief system and the Peruvian tourist-oriented economy initiates from the 2003 publication of the book Andean Awakening,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MaryAnn Male Jorge Luis Delgado (Author) |url=https://www.amazon.com/Andean-Awakening-Publisher-Council-Books/dp/B004OP45GC/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412193531&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=jorge+luis+delgado |title=Andean Awakening Publisher: Council Oak Books: MaryAnn Male Jorge Luis Delgado: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; authored by Jorge Luis Delgado, and Mary Anne Male. This is the source of the myth. They are followed by such authors as Mark Torra and Roger Calverley (CHAKANA: Secret Teachings of an Ancient Andean Mystery School).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/CHAKANA-Secret-Teachings-Ancient-Mystery-ebook/dp/B00FOXQZT8 |title=CHAKANA: Secret Teachings of an Ancient Andean Mystery School eBook: Roger Calverley: Kindle Store |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeoastronomer Carlos Milla Villena published his own, distinctly different speculative interpretations of the chacana as “andean, cross” in Génesis de la cultura andina,1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nVuAAAAMAAJ&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions |title=Génesis de la cultura andina - Carlos Milla Villena - Google Libros |publisher=Books.google.com.pe |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream scientific, scholastic, and archaeological sources do not refer to or support the word chakana as the cross-and-box design - rather, it is in [[Runasimi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clacsnyublog.com/2011/03/08/runa-simi-pantachiqkunamanta-about-the-forgers-of-runa-simi/ |title=Runa Simi pantachiqkunamanta – About the Forgers of Runa Simi &amp;#124; CLACS @ NYU |publisher=Clacsnyublog.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional language of the Inca peoples, (modern Quechua), derived from chaka, 'bridge', and means 'to cross over', or 'a crossing'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Crossroads-Earth-Sky-Cosmology-Monograph-ebook/dp/B00HEUJQ9U/ref=la_B001HCZIHA_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412197906&amp;sr=1-3 |title=At the Crossroads of the Earth and the Sky: An Andean Cosmology (Latin American Monographs: No. 55) - Kindle edition by Gary Urton. Politics &amp; Social Sciences Kindle eBooks @ |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among chroniclers such as the Jesuit missionary and naturalist José de Acosta, 1590,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Acosta, Historia natural y moral de las Indias, Sevilla 1590, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; it is applied to the group of stars commonly identified as the Belt of Orion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/andes/startable2.html |title=startab2 |publisher=Astronomy.pomona.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chroniclers do not refer to the chakana, or chacana, as the “andean cross,” or as reflecting a symbolical or semiotic tradition.

The twelve-cornered design itself occasionally appears in pre-contact artifacts such as textiles and ceramics from such cultures as the Wari, Ica, and Tiwanaku, but with no particular emphasis and no key or guide to a means of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tocapu.org/images/index.php |title=Images |publisher=tocapu.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Andeans and Andeanists regard the imposition of this modern “invented tradition"&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm &amp; Terence Ranger, ed. (1983). The Invention of Tradition. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521246458}}.&lt;/ref&gt;” as [[cultural appropriation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kareem |first=Nadra |url=http://racerelations.about.com/od/diversitymatters/fl/What-Is-Cultural-Appropriation-and-Why-Is-It-Wrong.htm |title=What Is Cultural Appropriation and Why Is It Wrong? |publisher=Racerelations.about.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Peruvian author Tupaq Katari writes: “When I hear you foreigners, with ease and lightness talking of the Andean themes, this surprises me, since we here in Peru continually try to find details about our own history, which is very complex and you argue so lightness without a historical or experiential support of what are the Andes and its diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shamanportal.org/article_details.php?id=891 |title=10th PACHAKUTI by Tupaq Katari / Shaman Portal |publisher=Shamanportal.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

'''Christian Gottlob Neefe''' ({{IPA-de|ˈneːfə|lang}}; 5 February 1748 &amp;ndash; 28 January 1798) was a German [[opera]] [[composer]] and [[Conducting|conductor]].

Neefe was born in [[Chemnitz]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]]. He received a musical education and started to compose at the age of 12. He studied law at [[Leipzig University]], but subsequently returned to music to become a pupil of the composer [[Johann Adam Hiller]] under whose guidance he wrote his first comic operas.

In 1776 Neefe joined the [[Seyler theatrical company]] of [[Abel Seyler]] (then) in Dresden, and inherited the position of musical director from his mentor, Hiller. He later became court organist in [[Bonn]] and was the principal piano teacher of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. He helped Beethoven produce some of his first works. His best known work was a [[Singspiel]] called ''[[Adelheit von Veltheim]]'' (1780). In Bonn, Neefe became prefect of the local chapter of the [[Illuminati]], the {{ill|Minervalkirche Stagira|de}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Freimaurer-Akten'', Bonn, group 5: "Die Brüder des Bonner Illuminatenordens betreffende Papiere", part 4: [http://s2w.hbz-nrw.de/ulbbn/urn/urn:nbn:de:hbz:5:1-62573 "Tabelle Tabelle (...) über die Insinuation des Amtskellers Uxfxbx zu Mainz"] ({{Abbr|1=[[i.e.]]|2=id est = that is}} Adam Umpfenbach), manuscript by Glaukus (i.e. Christian Gottlob Neefe), Stagira, 30 Dimeh 1152 (i.e. 30 October 1782), [[University of Bonn]] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2018|reason=Handwritten manuscript needs to be translated into English}} He died in [[Dessau]].

A '''disposition''' is a quality of character, a [[habit (psychology)|habit]], a preparation, a state of readiness, or a tendency to act in a specified way that may be learned.

The terms [[dispositional belief]] and [[occurrent belief]] refer, in the former case, to a [[belief]] that is held in the [[mind]] but not currently being considered, and in the latter case, to a belief that is currently being considered by the mind.

In [[Bourdieu]]'s theory of fields, dispositions are the natural tendencies of each individual to take on a specific position in any field. There is no strict determinism through one's dispositions. The ''habitus'' is the choice of positions according to one's dispositions. However, in retrospect a space of possibles can always be observed.

A disposition is not a process or event in some duration in time, but rather the state, preparation, or tendency of a structure "in waiting".  In the field of possibilities its actual triggering has a statistical value.

== In metaphysics ==
The debate about dispositions in [[metaphysics]] attempts to understand the fundamental nature of properties, including how they relate to [[Law of nature (science)|laws of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/952728282|title=Dispositions and causal powers|last=Bruno.|first=Kistler, Max. Gnassounou,|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315577616|oclc=952728282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial question asks if dispositions are real. [[Realism, Nominalism, Conceptualism|Realism]] about dispositions, or dispositionalism, argues that dispositions are causally efficacious properties inherent to objects that are sufficient to produce change. Consider fragility. If a glass is suitably struck, it will break. Fragility is a property of the glass that accounts for this breaking. Paradigmatic examples of dispositional properties include fragility, solubility, and flammability. Dispositionalism maintains that even paradigmatic examples of what appears to be qualitative such as squareness has causal powers (for instance - when combined with the property of hardness - to make a square impression in soft wax).&lt;ref&gt;[Shoemaker, S., 1980, ‘Causality and Properties’, in P. van Inwagen (ed.), Time and Cause: Essays Presented to Richard Taylor, Dordrecht: Reidel, 109–135.]&lt;/ref&gt; This view is historically argued for by [[Aristotle]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Contemporary proponents include [[Sydney Shoemaker]], [[Ullin Place|U.T Place]], [[Stephen Mumford]], Alexander Bird, [[George Molnar (philosopher)|George Molnar]], Brian Ellis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Dispositions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others answer that dispositions are not real properties. [[Anti-realism]] about dispositions, or categoricalism, argues that dispositions are ontologically derivative of the interaction categorical (or qualitative) properties and laws. Accordingly calling a glass fragile, is useful shorthand for describing the potential interactions of its microstructure (a categorical property) and the laws of nature; dispositions are not additional elements of being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Dispositions]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the microstructure and laws are enough to explain fragility, there is no causal role for a dispositional property, here fragility, to play. This view is historically argued for by [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], [[David Hume|Hume]] and the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]]. Contemporary proponents, including [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], [[David Malet Armstrong]], and [[Jonathan Schaffer]], continue in a neo-Humaen, empiricist tradition that argues for categoricalism on the assumption that there are no necessary connections between distinct existences.&lt;ref&gt;[Hume, D. (1748)An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Oxford: ClarendonPress 1975, ed. L.A. Selby-Bigge and P.H. Nidditch.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle ground views are possible. The most notable is the Limit (or Identity) View defended by [[Charles B. Martin]] and [[John Heil]]. According to this view, dispositional and categorical - or as Martin prefers: "qualitative," because categorical seems to be misleading - predicates are different ways of identifying one and the same property.[6] Additionally, the properties lies on a spectrum in which it could approach either limit; however, it can never reach either end because those concepts are unrealisable. Ontologically, however, there is no real difference between the two. Fragility, for example, is both a real disposition of glass to break upon being struck and an abstraction from the underlying molecular structure. Squareness, to take another example, is both a quality of having four sides of equal length that meet at equal angles and an abstraction from the fact this property interacts with its environment to leave square impressions on soft wax (when combined with the property ‘hardness’).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/33898477|title=Dispositions : a debate|last=1926-2014.|first=Armstrong, D. M. (David Malet),|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415144329|oclc=33898477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In law ==
In law, a [[Disposition (law)|disposition]] is a civil or criminal hearing where a case can be resolved.

== In educational research ==
In educational research, a learning disposition are characteristics or attitudes to learning. These may be learned. Some examples are taking responsibility, grit and persistence when faced with problems. 

== In religion ==

=== In the Catholic Church ===
In Catholic thought, "disposition" has two meanings. Firstly, it may refer to a deliberately practised [[habit]] of behaving in a certain way, for example, "a virtue is an habitual and firm disposition to do the good."&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a7.htm par. 1803]&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, it may refer to a state of a person that is required for reception of a [[sacrament]], for example, a disposition of genuine repentance is required for the forgiveness of sins in [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Dictionary'', [https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=36182 Sacramental dispositions].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Edward Douglas Fawcett was born in [[Hove]], [[Sussex]] on 11 April 1866.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary British Philosophy: Personal Statements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6mQj21I8z4C&amp;pg=PA83|year=1924|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-29555-0|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the elder son of [[Edward Fawcett]], an [[equerry]] to the [[Prince of Wales]], (King Edward VII)&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;"Mr. Douglas Fawcett."

He was educated at [[Newton Abbot College]] in Devon and was a Queen's Scholar at [[Westminster School]] from 1880.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

Fawcett converted to [[Buddhism]], having taken the pansil (the [[Laity|lay]] follower vow to the [[Five Precepts]]) while with [[Henry Steel Olcott]] in [[Ceylon]] (modern Sri Lanka) in January 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grann |first=David |year=2010 |title=The Lost City of Z |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=London |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucifer66"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= de Harlez |first=C. |title=The Buddhist Propaganda in Christian Countries |journal=The Dublin Review, Third Series |date=July 1890 |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBEJAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA56 |accessdate=10 July 2018 |publisher=Burns &amp; Oates Limited |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an associate of Russian occultist [[Helena Blavatsky]], leading theoretician of the esoteric religious movement  [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].

As a science fiction author, Fawcett published his first fantasy novel ''[[Hartmann the Anarchist]]'' in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Menville |first1=Douglas |title=Classics of Science Fiction and Fantasy |journal=Forgotten Fantasy |date=June 1971 |issue=5 |pages=7–10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYsiuGeM8DUC&amp;pg=PA7 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He published two adventure novels in the 1890's.  His 1894 novel ''Swallowed by an Earthquake'' drew favorable comparisons in London to the works of Jules Verne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Weekly Review of Literature, Science, and Art |journal=The Academy |date=12 January 1895 |volume=XLVI |page=491 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QQ9AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA491 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Bookseller |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPgiAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA53 |accessdate=5 July 2018 |issue=CCCCXLVI |date=9 January 1895 |location=London |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also authored multiple books on philosophy, including ''The Riddle of the Universe'' in 1893 on the [[metaphysical]] concept of [[Monadology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carus |first1=Paul |title=The Key to the Riddle of the Universe.

Fawcett married his cousin in M. B. V. Jackson in 1896.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and they lived principally in Switzerland for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rudolf Metz|title=A Hundred Years of British Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=erS3AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA433|date=2014-06-03|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-85322-0|page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fawcett devoted his life to mountaineering and philosophy.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; During this time, his philosophy centered around the idea that imagination was the fundamental reality of the universe.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Who Was Who&lt;/ref&gt;  Fawcett and his wife became the first people to ascend the [[Mer de Glace]] by automobile in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;"Montanvert Climbed by Auto for First Time." New York Herald [European Edition], 8 Aug. 1909, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fawcett returned to England and in 1947, he married his second wife, Vera Dick-Cunyngham, widow of George Dick-Cunyngham.  Fawcett died in London on 14 April 1960.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

'''Emilio Lledó Íñigo''' ([[Seville]], 5 November 1927) is a Spanish philosopher. He has been a professor at several universities and is a member of the [[Royal Spanish Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rae.es/rae/gestores/gespub000001.nsf/voTodosporId/E24678122D41E90EC125714100423C69?OpenDocument Royal Spanish Academy: Emilio Lledó] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228200325/http://www.rae.es/rae/gestores/gespub000001.nsf/voTodosporId/E24678122D41E90EC125714100423C69?OpenDocument |date=February 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He took his bachelor's degree at the Instituto de Bachillerato Cervantes and, in 1952, his degree in philosophy at the [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. He went to Germany to continue his studies in classical philosophy with [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], who helped him to finish his doctoral thesis by securing him a scholarship from the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]]. In 1955, he obtained a position at the Complutense University of Madrid, but returned to Germany after his marriage in 1958 because Gadamer, who was then a Dean of the faculty at the [[University of Heidelberg]], had offered him a position there.&lt;ref name="PF" /&gt;

In 1962, he again returned to Spain, taking a job as an instructor at the Instituto Núñez de Arce in [[Valladolid]]. After two years, he obtained a chair at the [[University of La Laguna]]. Shortly thereafter, in 1967, he moved to the [[University of Barcelona]], where he had been given the chair in Philosophy. In 1978, he moved again, to the [[Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia|National University of Distance Education]] (UNED), where he remained until his retirement.&lt;ref name="PF"&gt;[http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a106.htm Proyecto Filosofía: Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lledó was elected to Seat l of the [[Real Academia Española]] on 11 November 1993, he took up his seat on 27 November 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rae.es/academicos/emilio-lledo-inigo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001105504/http://www.rae.es/academicos/emilio-lledo-inigo |title=Emilio Lledó Íñigo |publisher=Real Academia Española |date= |archive-date=1 October 2015 |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical thought==
According to Lledó, the history of philosophy should be understood as a form of "collective memory", embracing mankind's total development, that can be structured through three main elements:
# [[Classical Greek philosophy]], with special attention to the [[Platonic dialogues]] and [[Aristotelian ethics]] as well as [[Epicureanism]].
# Attention to language as the principal object of philosophical analysis; which clearly converges in the development of the main currents of post-war European thought.
# Elaborating fully a consideration of [[temporality]] and writing that will lead to a "philosophy of memory" and a textual anthropology, from [[hermeneutic]] roots.
&lt;!-- It's modern philosophy...it's not supposed to make sense --&gt;

{{evolutionary biology}}
'''Fitness''' (often denoted '''&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;''' or '''ω''' in [[population genetics]] models) is the [[Numerical data|quantitative]] representation of [[natural selection|natural]] and [[sexual selection]] within [[evolution|evolutionary biology]]. It can be defined either with respect to a [[genotype]] or to a [[phenotype]] in a given environment. In either case, it describes individual [[reproductive success]] and is equal to the [[expected value|average contribution]] to the [[gene pool]] of the next generation that is made by individuals of the specified genotype or phenotype. The fitness of a genotype is manifested through its phenotype, which is also affected by the developmental environment. The fitness of a given phenotype can also be different in different selective environments.

With [[asexual reproduction]], it is sufficient to assign fitnesses to genotypes. With [[sexual reproduction]], genotypes are scrambled every generation. In this case, fitness values can be assigned to [[allele]]s by averaging over possible genetic backgrounds. Natural selection tends to make [[allele]]s with higher fitness more common over time, resulting in [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolution.

The term "Darwinian fitness" can be used to make clear the distinction with [[physical fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;Wassersug, J. D., and R. J. Wassersug, 1986. Fitness fallacies. Natural History 3:34-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Fitness does not include a measure of survival or life-span; [[Herbert Spencer]]'s  well-known phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" should be interpreted as: "Survival of the form (phenotypic or genotypic) that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations."

[[Inclusive fitness]] differs from individual fitness by including the ability of an allele in one individual to promote the survival and/or reproduction of other individuals that share that allele, in preference to individuals with a different allele. One mechanism of inclusive fitness is [[kin selection]].

==Fitness is a propensity==

Fitness is often defined as a [[propensity]] or probability, rather than the actual number of offspring. For example, according to [[Maynard Smith]], "Fitness is a property, not of an individual, but of a class of individuals — for example homozygous for allele A at a particular locus. Thus the phrase ’expected number of offspring’ means the average number, not the number produced by some one individual. If the first human infant with a gene for levitation were struck by lightning in its pram, this would not prove the new genotype to have low fitness, but only that the particular child was unlucky." &lt;ref&gt;Maynard-Smith, J. (1989) ''Evolutionary Genetics'' {{ISBN|0-19-854215-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, "the fitness of the individual - having an array x of [[phenotypes]] — is the probability, s(x), that the individual will be included among the group selected as parents of the next generation."&lt;ref&gt;Hartl, D. L. (1981) ''A Primer of Population Genetics'' {{ISBN|0-87893-271-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models of fitness: asexuals ==

To avoid the complications of sex and recombination, we initially restrict our attention to an asexual population without [[genetic recombination]]. Then fitnesses can be assigned directly to genotypes rather than having to worry about individual alleles. There are two commonly used measures of fitness; absolute fitness and relative fitness.

===Absolute fitness===

The absolute fitness (&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;) of a genotype is defined as the proportional change in the abundance of that genotype over one generation attributable to selection. For example, if &lt;math&gt; n(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the abundance of a genotype in generation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in an infinitely large population (so that there is no [[genetic drift]]), and neglecting the change in genotype abundances due to [[mutation]]s, then&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimura|first1=James F. Crow, Motoo|title=An introduction to population genetics theory|date=1970|publisher=Blackburn Press|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-1-932846-126|pages=5|edition=[Reprint]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n(t+1)=Wn(t)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/center&gt; 
An absolute fitness larger than 1 indicates growth in that genotype's abundance; an absolute fitness smaller than 1 indicates decline.

===Relative fitness===

Whereas absolute fitness determines changes in genotype abundance, relative fitness (&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;) determines changes in genotype [[Allele frequency|frequency]]. If &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the total population size in generation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and the relevant genotype's frequency is &lt;math&gt;p(t)=n(t)/N(t)&lt;/math&gt;, then 
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(t+1)=\frac{w}{\overline{w}}p(t)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\overline{w}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean relative fitness in the population (again setting aside changes in frequency due to drift and mutation). Relative fitnesses only indicate the change in prevalence of different genotypes relative to each other, and so only their values relative to each other are important; relative fitnesses can be any nonnegative number, including 0. It is often convenient to choose one genotype as a reference and set its relative fitness to 1. Relative fitness is used in the standard [[Genetic drift#Wright.E2.80.93Fisher model|Wright-Fisher]] and [[Moran process|Moran model]]s of population genetics.

Absolute fitnesses can be used to calculate relative fitness, since &lt;math&gt;p(t+1)=n(t+1)/N(t+1)=(W/\overline{W})p(t)&lt;/math&gt; (we have used the fact that &lt;math&gt;N(t+1)=\overline{W} N(t) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\overline{W}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean absolute fitness in the population). This implies that &lt;math&gt;w/\overline{w}=W/\overline{W}&lt;/math&gt;, or in other words, relative fitness is proportional to &lt;math&gt;W/\overline{W}&lt;/math&gt;. It is not possible to calculate absolute fitnesses from relative fitnesses alone, since relative fitnesses contain no information about changes in overall population abundance &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Change in genotype frequencies due to selection ===

[[File:Selective sweep, frequency vs time.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Increase in frequency over time of genotype &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, which has a 1% greater relative fitness than the other genotype present, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The change in genotype frequencies due to selection follows immediately from the definition of relative fitness,
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = p(t+1)-p(t)=\frac{w-\overline{w}}{\overline{w}}p(t) &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/center&gt;
Thus, a genotype's frequency will decline or increase depending on whether its fitness is lower or greater than the mean fitness, respectively.

In the particular case that there are only two genotypes of interest (e.g. representing the invasion of a new mutant allele), the change in genotype frequencies is often written in a different form. Suppose that two genotypes &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; have fitnesses &lt;math&gt;w_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_B&lt;/math&gt;, and frequencies &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;\overline{w}=w_A p + w_B (1-p)&lt;/math&gt;, and so
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \frac{w-\overline{w}}{\overline{w}}p = \frac{w_A-w_B}{\overline{w}}p(1-p) &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/center&gt;
Thus, the change in genotype &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'s frequency depends crucially on the difference between its fitness and the fitness of genotype &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Supposing that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is more fit than &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and defining the [[selection coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;w_A=(1+s)w_B&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \frac{w-\overline{w}}{\overline{w}}p = \frac{s}{1+sp}p(1-p)\approx sp(1-p) &lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;/center&gt;
where the last approximation hold for &lt;math&gt;s\ll 1&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the fitter genotype's frequency grows approximately [[Logistic function|logistically]].

== History ==
[[Image:Herbert Spencer.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Herbert Spencer]].]]
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[sociologist]] [[Herbert Spencer]] coined the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]"  in his 1864 work ''Principles of Biology'' to characterise what [[Charles Darwin]] had called [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=sotf&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-5140#back-mark-5140.f5 | title=Letter 5140 – Wallace, A. R. to Darwin, C. R., 2 July 1866 | publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project | accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-5145#mark-5145.f3 | title=Letter 5145 – Darwin, C. R. to Wallace, A. R., 5 July (1866) | publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project | accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;
^ "Herbert Spencer in his ''Principles of Biology'' of 1864, vol. 1, p. 444, wrote: 'This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called "natural selection", or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.'" {{Citation | url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=maurice_stucke | title=Better Competition Advocacy | accessdate=29 August 2007 | author=Maurice E. Stucke}}, citing HERBERT SPENCER, THE PRINCIPLES OF BIOLOGY 444 (Univ. Press of the Pac. 2002.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The British biologist [[J.B.S. Haldane]] was the first to quantify fitness, in terms of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] of Darwinism and [[Mendelian genetics]] starting with his 1924 paper ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection]]''. The next further advance was the introduction of the concept of [[inclusive fitness]] by the British biologist [[W.D. Hamilton]] in 1964 in his paper on ''[[The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour]]''.

[[Genetic load]] measures the average fitness of a population of individuals, relative either to a theoretical genotype of optimal fitness, or relative to the most fit genotype actually present in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ewens|first1=Warren J.|title=Mathematical population genetics.|date=2003|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0387201917|edition=2nd|pages=78–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider n genotypes &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} _1 \dots \mathbf{A} _n&lt;/math&gt;, which have the fitnesses &lt;math&gt;w_1 \dots w_n&lt;/math&gt; and the [[genotype frequency|genotype frequencies]] &lt;math&gt;p_1 \dots p_n&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Ignoring [[frequency-dependent selection]], then genetic load (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) may be calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt;L = {{w_\max - \bar w}\over w_\max}&lt;/math&gt;

Genetic load may increase when deleterious mutations, migration, [[inbreeding depression|inbreeding]], or [[outbreeding depression|outcrossing]] lower mean fitness. Genetic load may also increase when beneficial mutations increase the maximum fitness against which other mutations are compared; this is known as the [[Haldane's dilemma|substitutional load or cost of selection]].

[[File:Gregorio de Valencia.jpg|thumb|Gregory of Valencia]]
'''Gregory of Valencia''' ('''{{lang-es|Gregorio de Valencia}}''') (c. 1550 – April 25, 1603) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] humanist and scholar who was a professor at the [[University of Ingolstadt]].  

==Life==

Gregory of Valencia was born in [[Medina del Campo]] around 1549–50.
He received his Bachelor of Arts from the [[University of Salamanca]], where he undertook the Jesuit novitiate in 1565. In 1567, he went on to study theology at Salamanca, where through his instructor, Mancio, he became interested in the theological renewal movement initiated by Francisco de Vitoria. 
He studied theology at Valladolid (1568–1571).
In 1571, he was called by [[St. Francis Borgia]], superior general of the Jesuit order, to teach philosophy in [[Rome]].  There he was ordained a priest.  
He continued his studies at Salamanca (1572). 

Gregory of Valencia was appointed Professor at the University of Dillinguen (1573–1574), and at Ingolstadt (1575–1597) where he taught scholastic theology. 
He was a member of the [[Jesuit College of Ingolstadt]] while teaching at the [[University of Ingolstadt]].
He then became Professor and Director of the Jesuit College in Rome (1598) at the request of [[Pope Clement VIII]]. In 1600, he defended the doctrine of the Spanish theologian [[Luis de Molina]] on grace and predestination before the Roman [[Curia]].
He wrote a work in four volumes, covering the whole field of scholastic theology.  
He held the position of prefect of studies in the [[Collegio Romano]] until, broken in health through incessant work, he died at [[Naples]] on 25 March 1603.  [[Pope Clement VIII]] honored him with the title of ''Doctor doctorum''.

==Work==
[[Image:Valencia - Commentarii theologici, 1603 - 4412452.tif |thumb|''Commentarii theologici'', 1603]]

Gregory's work is characterized by a [[School of Salamanca|renewed]] [[Scholasticism]] in which natural reason is employed to delve deeper into preexisting theological sources. His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], the ''Theological Commentaries'', employs the method of [[Francisco de Vitoria]] to comment on the ''Summa'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]].

Apart from various works of controversy and several apologies and speeches, his main doctrinal treatises are:
* Analysis fidei Catholicae (1585).
* Libri quinque de Trinitate (1586).
* De reali Christi praesentia in eucharistia... libri tres (1587).
* De rebus fidei hoc tempore controversis libri (1591).
*Commentariorum theologicorum tomi quatuor. In quibus omnes materiae quae continetur in Summa Divi Thomae explicantur (1591–1597).

'''Henry Noble Day''' (August 4, 1808 – January 12, 1890) was an American philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Henry Noble Day - Oxford Reference|url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095703574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day, the second son of Col. Noble and Elizabeth (Jones) Day, and nephew of Yale President [[Jeremiah Day]], was born in the village of [[New Preston, Connecticut|New Preston]], in [[Washington, Connecticut]], August 4, 1808.

He graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1828.  After having taught for nearly two years in [[Burlington, New Jersey|Burlington, N. J.]], and having begun the study of law in [[Philadelphia]], he was appointed tutor in Yale in 1831. He continued in that office for three years, taking at the same time the full course in the [[Yale Divinity School]]. After fifteen months' travel in Europe he was ordained pastor of the First Congregational church in [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], Conn., on November 9, 1836.

He resigned this charge, October 1, 1840, to accept the chair of Sacred Rhetoric in [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]], at [[Hudson, Ohio]]. He remained in connection with that institution until 1858, the title of his professorship for the last fourteen years being Practical Theology. During his residence in Hudson he took a leading part in the endeavor to obtain a railroad connection with [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Cleveland]].  In 1858 his interest in the higher education of women induced him to accept the presidency of the [[Ohio Female College]], at [[College Hill, Cincinnati|College Hill]], in the suburbs of [[Cincinnati]].

After a successful administration of six years, he resigned and removed to [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] as the most attractive place for the literary work to which he proposed to devote himself. He had already published several volumes, beginning with ''The Art of Elocution'', in 1844. His ''Art of Rhetoric'', a much approved text-book, first appeared in 1850. During the quarter of a century after his return to New Haven his pen was continually busy, and his separate publications in book form (ending with a volume on ''The Science of Education'' in 1889) number about twenty. The degree of [[Doctor of law|Doctor of Laws]] was conferred on him by [[Iowa State University]] in 1877.

He died in New Haven, from an attack of [[influenza]], resulting in [[pleurisy]], on January 12, 1890, in the 82nd year of his age.

He married, April 27, 1836, Jane Louisa, daughter of Simeon Marble, of New Haven, who survived him with one son and two daughters.

In [[philosophy]], '''involution''' refers to a situation in which a process or object is [[ontology|ontologically]] "turned in" upon itself.

==Involuted values==
In [[meta-ethics]], involution of values is the extension of an otherwise convenient and decent system of values to its inevitable logical conclusion, with an indecent or inconvenient result.{{cn|date=April 2014}}

{{third-party|date=November 2015}}
'''Ishikism''', [pron: 'Ishik-ism] ({{lang-tr|Işıkçılık}}) or '''Ishik Alevism''' (''{{lang|tr|Işık Aleviliği}}''), also known as '''Chinarism''' (''{{lang|tr|Çınarcılık}}''), is a [[new religious movement|new]] [[syncretism|syncretic]] religious movement among [[Alevism|Alevis]] who have developed an alternative understanding of [[Alevism]] and its history. These alternative interpretations and beliefs were inspired by Turkish writer Erdoğan Çınar with the publication of his book ''Aleviliğin Gizli Tarihi'' (''The Secret History of Alevism'') in 2004.

==Işık faith==
While mainstream Alevis believe the term ''"Alevi"'' means  "follower of [[Ali]]", as in the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word [[‘Alawī]] (علوي), and consider themselves followers of the teachings and practices of 13th-century Alevi saint [[Haji Bektash Veli]], Ishik believe differently. The Ishik movement claim that the term "Alevi" is derived from the old [[Anatolia]]n [[Luvians]], claiming that the word "Luvi" means "People of light" in the [[Hittite language]]. Some [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] documents from the 16th century refer to the ancestors of today's Alevis as "Işık Taifesi", meaning "People of Light". This is, according to Ishikīs, a proof of the connection between the Luvians and Alevis.

The Ishik Alevis have been likened to the Kurdish [[Yezidi]]s, as part of a wider monotheistic tradition called [[Yazdanism]].  A shared cultural history of that nature relates to common folklore describing the invention of agriculture by plant domestication.  Wheat is assumed to have been first cultured in the northern part of the Middle East; and likewise, regional peoples shared a culinary tradition in the types of vegetables they consume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pieroni | first1 = Andrea | first2 = Hiwa M. | last2 = Ahmed | first3 = Hawre | last3 = Zahir| title = The spring has arrived: traditional wild vegetables gathered by Yarsanis (Ahl-e Haqq) and Sunni Muslims in Western Hawraman, SE Kurdistan, Iraq | journal = history | volume = 86| issue =1 | year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-image===
Ishikīs consider themselves to be [[Esotericism|esotericists]], claiming that Alevism is Esotericism itself, meaning that they identify themselves with every type of esotericism in history (e.g. [[Jewish]] esotericists, [[Christian]] esotericists, [[Islam]]ic and [[Pagan]] esotericism etc.)

They claim that [[Alevism]] is the oldest religion in the world, that has changed shapes throughout time. This "First and True Religion" of the world, is claimed to have been the main source for all other religions and beliefs in the world:

{{quote|It has now been brought into the open with all its truth, that Alevism, with its tens of thousands of years of history, has influenced all beliefs and has been the Original Source (the so-called "Serçeşme" - meaning "Beginning Spot of Fountain") of the celestial religions.| Erdoğan Çınar in: ''Aleviliğin Gizli Tarihi'', 2004.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|tr|Aleviliğin, on binlerce yıllık geçmişten gelen, bütün inanışları etkilemiş, semavi dinlere başlangıç oluşturmuş asıl kaynak, "Serçeşme", olduğunu bütün gerçekliğiyle ortaya çıkartıyor.}}" in: {{harvnb|Çınar|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Ishikīs also claim that the religious ceremonies practiced by [[Alevis]] were practiced as early as by the [[Hittites]] and even by the [[Sumer]]ians. According to Ishikīs, medieval [[Christian]] sects as [[Paulicianism]], [[Bogomilism]] etc. were also [[Alevis]]. A good example of this belief can be found in the translation of the book ''The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Sean Martin (writer and director)|Sean Martin]]|title=The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages |year=2005 |publisher=Pocket Essentials}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2005) by [[Sean Martin (writer and director)|Sean Martin]]. Even though the original [[English language|English]] version does not contain the word "Alevi", the Turkish translator has translated the title of the book as ''Ortaçağ'da Avrupa'da Alevi Hareketi - Katharlar'' (An Alevi Movement in The Middle Ages – The Cathars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sean Martin |title=Ortaçağ'da Avrupa'da Alevi Hareketi – Katharlar |trans-title=An Alevi Movement in The Middle Ages – The Cathars |year=2005 |publisher=Kalkedon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical beliefs===
Compared to traditional [[Alevism]], the most striking differences of the Ishik movement are their interpretation of history. The Ishik movement claims that [[Alevis]] have changed their apparent identity several times in history in order to survive. According to Ishikī belief, [[heretic]] sects like the Paulicians and Bogomils were actually [[Alevis]] compelled to appear as [[Christian]]s because of the [[Byzantine]] oppression. Likewise the modern [[Alevis]] have gained an Islamic appearance because of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] oppression.

Ishikī thought is convinced that most [[heterodox]] groups are inventions as a result of oppression, meaning that groups like the [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]], [[Bektashism and folk religion|Bektashism]], [[Ibn Nusayr|Nusayrī]] [[Alawism]], [[Ghulāt]] and [[Ahl-e Haqq]] are in reality separate from real [[Islam]].
 	
==Criticism==
The Ishikī versus Traditionalist split has caused a deep gap in [[Alevi]] society. This is the first time in centuries that [[Alevis]] have experienced such a great split in terms of beliefs.

*Traditionalist [[Alevis]] have strongly opposed the Ishikīs, who they consider as people who are creating a completely new religion, or sometimes as undercover agents, trying to disrupt [[Alevi]] unity. Ishikīs are also criticized for being extremely political and for abandoning fundamental [[Alevi]] sources, such as the [[Buyruks]], one of the most known written source among [[Alevis]].
*The Alevi historian, Hamza Aksüt, responded to the works of Erdoğan Çınar in several articles, criticizing him for being intentionally manipulative and highly conspirational. were officially given as a reply to the interview with Erdoğan Çınar: ''Çınar'dan uyarı: 'Her flörtün sonu evlilikle bitmez''' (Notice from Çınar: 'Not all flirts end with marriage').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hamza Aksüt |title=Çınar'dan uyarı: 'Her flörtün sonu evlilikle bitmez' |publisher=renkhaber |date=9 March 2009 |url=http://www.renkhaber.com/haberler/Roportaj.56/Cinar_dan_uyari___Her_flortun_sonu_evlilikle_bitmez_/8270.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319080118/http://www.renkhaber.com/haberler/Roportaj.56/Cinar_dan_uyari___Her_flortun_sonu_evlilikle_bitmez_/8270.html |archivedate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer, Ünsal Öztürk has also criticized Erdoğan Çınar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ünsal Öztürk |title=Yazın hayatının tanımadığı bir facia: Erdoğan Çınar |publisher=renkhaber |date=10 March 2009 |url=http://www.renkhaber.com/haberler/Yorum_Analiz.39/Yazin_hayatinin_tanimadigi_bir_facia__Erdogan_Cinar/8316.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121042710/http://www.renkhaber.com/haberler/Yorum_Analiz.39/Yazin_hayatinin_tanimadigi_bir_facia__Erdogan_Cinar/8316.html |archivedate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Hamza Aksüt, Hasan Harmancı and Ünsal Öztürk went together in publishing the book ''Alevi Tarih Yazımında Skandal – Erdoğan Çınar Örneği'' (A Scandal in Alevi History Writing – The Erdoğan Çınar Example), which is an analysis and explaining of the claimed manipulation and "tampering"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harmancı |first=Hamza |title=Alevi Tarih Yazımında Skandal |publisher=Yurt Kitap Yayın |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; made by Erdoğan Çınar.
*''Erdoğan Çınar'' received lots of criticism from [[Alevi]]s and Alevi [[Dede (religious figure)|Dedes]] (for example Baki Güngör dede&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|3G5xw_AD8WM}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who claim that Çınar's book is full of misconceptions and contradictions and consider it as yet another attempt of ''"Yol-Yezidiler" (enemies of the path of their tariqa)'' to assimilate the [[Alevi]]s and to separate them from the mystic teachings of [[Haji Bektash Veli]], [[Pir Sultan Abdal]], [[Yunus Emre]] and [[The Twelve Imams]].
*Some traditionalists have even gone so far as to demand that Ishikī dedes like ''Hasan Kılavuz'' should get the penalty of social exclusion which in reality does not correspond with the actual welcoming nature of Alevisim.

==Ishikī Dedes==
Even though most [[dedes]] are still traditionalists, some of them have eventually adopted Ishikī thought. The first dedes who openly declared their non-traditionalist beliefs were Ali Haydar Cilasun, with the publication of his book ''Alevilik Bir Sır Değildir'' (Alevism is Not a Secret) in 1995, and Hasan Kılavuz in 2003. The latter is now one of the prominent figures in the Alevi Confederation of Europe (AABK) and its television channel YOL TV.

==Ishikī organizations==
The Ishik movement have succeeded in becoming very influential in important and powerful [[Alevi]] organizations.{{dubious|date=November 2015}} The Alevi Confederation of Europe (AABK) for instance, has abandoned its traditional Alevi beliefs in 2006, which it replaced with a marginal Ishikī type{{Original research inline|date=November 2015}} of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AABF ve AABK yeni proğram değişikliği ile Aleviliği kuşa çevirmeye devam ediyor! |publisher=Alevi Yolu |date=15 January 2007 |url=http://www.aleviyolu.net/15-01-2007/aabf-ve-aabk-yeni-program-degisikligi-ile-aleviligi-kusa-cevirmeye-devam-ediyor.html

[[File:Retrato de Juan de Mal Lara.jpg|thumb|Juan de Mal Lara.]]
'''Juan de Mal Lara''' ([[Sevilla]], 1524 – Sevilla, 1571) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[humanism|humanist]], [[poet]], [[playwright]] and [[Paremiology|paremiologue]] at the [[University of Seville]] during the period of the [[Spanish Renaissance]] in the reign of [[Philip II of Spain]].

==Biography==
Mal Lara studied [[Latin Language|Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] grammar at the College of San Miguel in [[Sevilla]]. His teacher was Pedro Fernandez de Castilleja and later Mal Lara taught humanities to Mateo Alemán. It was a decade later, after studying at the [[University of Salamanca]], where he was student of Hernán Núñez one of classmates was Francisco Sánchez de las Brozas, known as the "Brocense"; later he went to [[Valencia]] and [[Barcelona]], where he completed his studies with Francisco Escobar before returning again to Salamanca. In 1548 he returned to Seville to study Arts. By 1550 he taught at [[humanities]] and [[literature]] in a [[grammar school]] in Sevilla.

In 1565, the Count of Gelves in Seville, established his "[[Merlin]]'s Garden" in the fields near Tablada, and this became a regular  gathering of an academic circle which also included  Baltasar del Alcázar, Francisco Pacheco, Juan de la Cueva Christopher Mosquera de Figueroa, Cristóbal de Mesa, Francisco Medina and Fernando de Herrera, which group later were known as the Sevillian Poetry School.

Mal Lara was investigated by the Spanish Inquisition in 1561, but was cleared of all charges in 1566, the year he moved to Madrid to join the royal court of king Philip II of Spain. Philip of Spain  also claimed to be king of England and Ireland following his marriage to [[Mary I of England]] was known as 'the prudent' since despite several financial crisis  was an intelligent ruler and dedicated philosophical scholar who particularly studied the work of the Roman orator [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] which is why in modern Spanish a serious but informal discussion is called ''"una tertulia"''

Within this intensive royal court Mal Laura composed verses to accompany or embellish certain paintings by [[Titian]] and was commissioned to create allegorical motif for the [[Real (galley)|flagship]] of [[John of Austria|Don Juan de Austria]], which included writing an elaborate description of ''"the royal galley of Serene Don Juan de Austria, Captain of all the Seas"''.

He married to Maria de Ojeda with whom he had two daughters, Gila and Silvestra. He also worked with scholars and historians as important as [[Gonzalo Argote de Molina]]. He is credited, although this is widely disputed, with the invention of the structure of the ten-line stanza known as a [[Décima]] popularized [[Vicente Espinel]], in whose honor the décima is also known as a "Spinel".

An unpublished biography of Mal Lara is preserved  in the Municipal Archives of Seville.

==Works==
In his lifetime he was mostly known for two works: ''Philosophia vulgar'' (Seville,  1568), the first part of which contains ''one thousand and one [[refrain]]s'': pithy sayings or [[proverb]]s to be [[Rote learning|learned by heart]], in which preliminary discourse extols the wisdom embedded in ancient sayings, although  this work sometimes follows the [[Adagia]] of  [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and other similar classical writers.

The other major work was a tribute that Mal Lara wrote with Alonso Escribano for  ''Rey Phelipe de Seuilla'' (Philip II Spain and thus also of Seville), to deliver in 1570 extolling the virtues of ''the very noble and loyal city of Seuilla''  in gratitude for the warm welcome received by Philip.

Mal Lara also described the lavish decoration of the walls of Seville with figures and allegorical verses representing the various divisions within the Seville jurisdiction. The book was published after the victory of the monarch against the [[Morisco rebellions in Granada#The second rebellion, 1568-71|Moorish rebellion of Alpujarras]].

''Psyche'', a mythological poem in [[Hendecasyllable]] style was not well received at the time. It was inspired ''Psyche and Cupid''  included in ''The Golden Ass'' a novel of [[Apuleius]]. His fifth book was published by Mario Gasparini at the  Trilingual University College of Salamanca in 1947. He also composed  [[eclogue]]s  ''Narciso and Laurea'', ''Annotations to the syntax of Erasmus'', a philosophical dissertation ''Pilgrimage of life'', as well as ''Principles of Grammar'', guidance ''Notes on Emblems of [[Andrea Alciato]]'', the ''[[Scholia]] of [[Rhetoric]] on the introductions of [[Aphthonius of Antioch]]'', ''Chronicle of the Holy Apostles'', a poem in octaves ''The Death of Orpheus'' and a Latin poem ''The Martyrdom of Saints Justa and Rufina, patron of Seville'' .

Some of his dramatic works are noteworthy, including  the [[tragedy]] ''Absalom'' and the [[comedy]] ''Locusta'', first performed at the University of Salamanca in 1548 both in [[Latin]] and [[Castilian language]]s; he continued this dramatic activity in Seville, where he composed the comedy ''In praise of Our Lady of Consolation'' performed by his students in [[Utrera]] in 1561. A probable work entitled ''Tragedy of San Hermenegildo'' is lost. [[Juan de la Cueva]], in his ''Poetic Exemplar'' places Mal Lara him among the classical playwrights in the [[Aristotelian tradition]], although with some reservations.

''The Spirited Hercules'' is an [[erudition|erudite]] poetic work formerly believed lost but subsequently rediscovered via a copy within the [[Ajuda National Palace]] in Portugal.  It was highly praised by his contemporaries and contains details about the Seville group and [[Chansonnier]] lyrics that deserve careful study. It is written in stanzas and divided into twelve books, each with four songs. It is dedicated to Prince Carlos with the intention to  glorify twelve victories of his grandfather, alluded to allegorically within the main theme  of the poem, by singing the praises of the [[mythological]] feats of the twelve [[labors of Hercules]]. Thus, the [[Nemean lion]] symbolizes the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]], the [[Erymanthian Boar]] is [[Francis I of France]], etc.

The poem ends with the vision of king Philip II as [[Theseus]],essentially a new [[Hercules]] to relieve [[Atlas]]. Mal Lara started this work in 1549, but he died suddenly and so was unable to deliver the manuscript to the printer.

The surviving poems of Mal Lara may be found in Volume XLII of the Biblioteca de Autores Españoles; his complete works were published in three volumes by Manuel Bernal Rodríguez in 1996, within the Castro Library.

'''Kenneth Grant''' (23 May 1924&amp;nbsp;– 15 January 2011) was an English [[ceremonial magic]]ian and prominent advocate of the [[Thelema|Thelemic]] religion. A poet, novelist, and writer, he founded his own Thelemic organisation, the [[Typhonian Order|Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis]]—later renamed the Typhonian Order—with his wife Steffi Grant.

Born in [[Ilford]], [[Essex]], Grant developed an interest in [[occultism]] and Asian religion during his teenage years. After several months serving in India with the [[British Army]] during the [[Second World War]], he returned to Britain and became the personal secretary of [[Aleister Crowley]], the ceremonial magician who had founded Thelema in 1904. Crowley instructed Grant in his [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] practices and initiated him into his own occult order, the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.). When Crowley died in 1947, Grant was seen as his heir apparent in Britain, and was appointed as such by the American head of the O.T.O., [[Karl Germer]]. In 1949, Grant befriended the occult artist [[Austin Osman Spare]], and in ensuing years helped to publicise Spare's artwork through a series of publications. 

In 1954 Grant founded the [[London]]-based New Isis Lodge, through which he added to many of Crowley's Thelemic teachings, bringing in [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] themes and influences from the work of fantasy writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. This was anathema to Germer, who expelled Grant from the O.T.O. in 1955, although the latter continued to operate his Lodge regardless until 1962. During the 1950s he also came to be increasingly interested in [[Hinduism]], exploring the teachings of the Hindu guru [[Ramana Maharshi]] and publishing a range of articles on the topic. He was particularly interested in the Hindu [[tantra]], incorporating ideas from it into the Thelemic practices of [[sex magic]]. On Germer's death in 1969, Grant proclaimed himself Outer Head of the O.T.O. This title was disputed by the American [[Grady Louis McMurtry|Grady McMurtry]], who took control of the O.T.O. Grant's Order became known as the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis, operating from his home in [[Golders Green]], north London. In 1959 he began publishing on occultism and wrote the Typhonian Trilogies as well as various novels and books of poetry, much of which propagated the work of Crowley and Spare.

Grant's writings and teachings have proved a significant influence over other currents of occultism, including [[chaos magic]], the [[Temple of Set]] and the [[Dragon Rouge]]. They also attracted academic interest within the study of Western esotericism, particularly from Henrik Bogdan and Dave Evans.

==Biography==

===Early life and Aleister Crowley: 1924&amp;ndash;1947===
Grant was born on 23 May 1924 in [[Ilford]], [[Essex]], the son of a Welsh clergyman.{{sfnm|1a1=Anon|1y=2011|2a1=O'Neill|2y=2011}} By his early teenage years, Grant had read widely on the subject of [[Western esotericism]] and Asian religions,{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2004|1p=226|2a1=Evans|2y=2007|2p=285}} including the work of prominent occultist [[Helena Blavatsky]].{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=2}} He had made use of a personal magical symbol ever since being inspired to do so in a visionary dream he experienced in 1939; he spelled its name variously as A'ashik, Oshik, or Aossic.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2004|1p=226|2a1=Evans|2y=2007|2p=286|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=533}} Aged 18, in the midst of the [[Second World War]], Grant volunteered to join the [[British Army]], later commenting that he hoped to be posted to [[British India]], where he could find a spiritual [[guru]] to study under.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2004|1p=226|2a1=Evans|2y=2007|2p=285}} He was never posted abroad, and was ejected from the army aged 20 due to an unspecified medical condition.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2004|1p=226|2a1=Evans|2y=2007|2p=285|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=533}}

[[File:Aleister Crowley.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Crowley, who became Grant's guru.]]
Grant was fascinated by the work of the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], having read a number of his books. Eager to meet Crowley, Grant unsuccessfully wrote to Crowley's publishers, asking them to give him his address; however, the publisher had moved address themselves, meaning that they never received his letter.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=286|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=533}} He also requested that Michael Houghton, proprietor of Central London's esoteric bookstore [[Atlantis Bookshop]], introduce him to Crowley. Houghton refused, privately remarking that Grant was "mentally unstable."{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=286|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=533}} Grant later stated his opinion that Houghton had refused because he didn't wish to "incur evil ''[[karma]]''" from introducing the young man to Crowley,{{sfnm|1a1=Grant|1y=1980|1p=87|2a1=Evans|2y=2004|2p=227}} but later suggested that it was because Houghton desired him for his own organisation, The Order of Hidden Masters, and thereby didn't want him to become Crowley's disciple.{{sfnm|1a1=Grant|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Evans|2y=2004|2p=227|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=533}} Persisting, Grant wrote letters to the new address of Crowley's publishers, asking that they pass his letters on to Crowley himself.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=286}} These resulted in the first meeting between the two, in autumn 1944,{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=286}} at the Bell Inn in [[Buckinghamshire]].{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=2}}

After several further meetings and an exchange of letters, Grant agreed to work for Crowley as his secretary and personal assistant. Now living in relative poverty, Crowley was unable to pay Grant for his services in money, instead paying him in magical instruction.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=286|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=533&amp;ndash;534|3a1=Bogdan|3y=2015|3p=2}} In March 1945, Grant moved into a lodge cottage in the grounds of Netherwood, a [[Sussex]] boarding house where Crowley was living.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2004|1p=227|2a1=Evans|2y=2007|2p=286|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=534}} He continued living there with Crowley for several months, dealing with the old man's correspondences and needs. In turn, he was allowed to read from Crowley's extensive library on occult subjects, and performed ceremonial magic workings with him, becoming a high initiate of Crowley's magical group, the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.).{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=287}} Crowley saw Grant as a potential leader of O.T.O. in the UK, writing in his diary, "value of Grant. If I die or go to the USA, there must be a trained man to take care of the English O.T.O."{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2004|1p=227|2a1=Evans|2y=2007|2p=287}} However, they also argued, with Grant trying to convince Crowley to relocate to London.{{sfn|Kaczynski|2010|p=534}} On one occasion Crowley shouted at him: "You are the most consummate BORE that the world has yet known. And this at 20!"{{sfn|Kaczynski|2010|p=534}}

Grant's family disliked that he was working for no wage, and pressured him to resign, which he did in June 1945, leaving Netherwood.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2004|1p=227|2a1=Evans|2y=2007|2p=287}} Crowley wrote to Grant's father, stating that he was "very sorry to part with Kenneth" and that he felt that Grant was "giving up his real future."{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=287}} To David Curwen, an O.T.O. member who was another of his correspondents, Crowley related his opinion that "I may have treated him too severely."{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=288}} Crowley put Curwen in contact with Grant, with Grant later claiming that he learned much from Curwen, particularly regarding the [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] school of [[Tantra]]; in his later writings he made reference to Curwen using his Order name of Frater Ani Abthilal.{{sfn|Bogdan|2013|pp=188&amp;ndash;189}} Although they continued to correspond with one another, Crowley and Grant never met again, for the former died in December 1947.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=289}} Grant attended Crowley's funeral at a Brighton crematorium, while accompanied by his new wife, Steffi.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=289|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=549}}

===The New Isis Lodge and Austin Osman Spare: 1947&amp;ndash;1969===

[[File:Austin Osman Spare.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grant befriended the occult artist Austin Osman Spare (pictured in 1904).]]

Steffi Grant introduced herself to the occult artist [[Austin Osman Spare]] in 1949, having learned about him while she was modelling for [[Herbert Budd]], a tutor at [[St. Martin's School of Art]] who had studied alongside Spare.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=293|2a1=Baker|2y=2011|2p=209}} Steffi purchased two of Spare's artworks, which she gave to Kenneth as a present for his twenty-fifth birthday.{{sfn|Baker|2011|p=210}} She subsequently introduced her husband to Spare.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=293|2a1=Baker|2y=2011|2p=211}}
At the time, Spare had fallen into poverty, living in obscurity in a South London flat. Although making some money as an artist and art tutor, he was largely financially supported by his friend Frank Letchford, whom he affectionately referred to as his "son".{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=293}} There was some animosity between Letchford and Grant, although it is apparent that Spare preferred the former, having known him for 12 years longer, and placing him first in his will.{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=293&amp;ndash;294}} Grant desired a closer relationship, and in 1954 began signing his letters to Spare "thy son."{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=293&amp;ndash;294}} Letchford claimed that Spare often told the Grants "white lies&amp;nbsp;... to boost a flagging ego."{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=297}} Grant's first published work represented a brief "appreciation" of Spare's work that was included in a catalogue for the artist's exhibition held at Temple Bar in London in 1949.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=10}}

Grant had continued studying Crowley's work, and a year after Crowley's death was acknowledged as a Ninth Degree member of the O.T.O. by [[Karl Germer]], Crowley's successor as Head of the O.T.O.{{sfnm|1a1=Bogdan|1y=2013|1p=196|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2015|2p=2}} Grant then successfully applied to Germer for a charter to operate the first three O.T.O. degrees and run his own lodge, which was granted in March 1951.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=324|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=555|3a1=Bogdan|3y=2013|3p=196|4a1=Bogdan|4y=2015|4p=2}} As this would mean that his lodge would be the only chartered O.T.O. body in England at the time, Grant believed that it meant that he was now head of the O.T.O. in Britain.{{sfnm|1a1=Bogdan|1y=2013|1p=196|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2015|2p=3}} Germer put Grant in contact with [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]], an English Thelemite based in [[California]] who had founded the Agape Lodge, knowing that Smith was the only man who had practical knowledge of the O.T.O. degree work. Smith was eager to help, and wrote at length on his experiences in founding a lodge, although he was made uneasy by Grant's magical seal of "Aossic" for reasons that have never been ascertained, and their correspondence soon petered out.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=324}}

Grant began restructuring the system of the O.T.O. by augmenting its grading structure with that of Crowley's other occult order, the [[A∴A∴]].{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|pp=2&amp;ndash;3}} This attempt failed, as Grant's attentions were increasingly drawn into his founding and running of the New Isis Lodge.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=3}} The lodge became operational in April 1955 when Grant issued a manifesto announcing his discovery of an extraterrestrial "Sirius/Set current" upon which the lodge was to be based.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=324|2a1=O'Neill|2y=2011}} In this manifesto, Grant claimed that a new [[Energy (esotericism)|energy]] was emanating down from Earth from another planet which he identified with [[Nuit]], a goddess who appears in the first chapter of Crowley's Thelemic holy text, ''[[The Book of the Law]]''.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=3}} Germer however deemed it "blasphemy" that Grant had identified a single planet with Nuit; on 20 July 1955, Germer issued a "Note of Expulsion" expelling Grant from the O.T.O.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=324&amp;ndash;325|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=556|3a1=Bogdan|3y=2013|3p=196|4a1=Bogdan|4y=2015|4p=3}}

[[File:Sri Ramana Maharshi - Portrait - G. G Welling - 1948.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Grant became a follower of Indian guru Ramana Maharshi]]

Grant however ignored Germer's letter of expulsion, continuing to operate the New Isis Lodge under the claim that he had powers from the "Inner Plane".{{sfnm|1a1=Bogdan|1y=2013|1p=196|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2015|2p=3}} Upon learning of Grant's expulsion, Smith feared that the O.T.O. would split up into warring factions much as the [[Theosophical Society]] had done following the death of Blavatsky.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=325}} Grant's Lodge continued to operate until 1962.{{sfnm|1a1=Bogdan|1y=2010|1p=xxxix|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2013|2p=197|3a1=Bogdan|3y=2015|3p=3}} According to Grant, the group consisted of about thirty members, and met every seventh Friday at the lodge's premises, which for a while were in the basement of Curwen's furrier's store at Melcombe Street, near to [[Baker Street]] in central London.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}} During the period in which he worked with the lodge he claimed to have received two important texts from preternatural sources, the ''Wisdom of S'lba'' and ''OKBISh'' or ''The Book of the Spider''.{{sfn|Bogdan|2010|p=xxxix}}

From 1953 to 1961 Grant immersed himself in the study of [[Hinduism]],{{sfn|Bogdan|2013|pp=196&amp;ndash;197}} becoming a follower of the Hindu guru [[Ramana Maharshi]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bogdan|1y=2010|1p=xxxix|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2013|2p=196|3a1=Bogdan|3y=2015|3p=5}} He was also interested in the work of another Hindu teacher, [[Lord Kusuma Haranath]], and was credited with encouraging and helping to create the three-volume ''Lord Haranath: A Biography'' by [[Akella Ramakrishna Sastri]].{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=5}} He also authored articles on [[Advaita Vedanta]] and other Hindu topics for Indian journals like the [[Bombay]]-based ''The Call Divine'',{{sfnm|1a1=Bogdan|1y=2010|1p=xxxix|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2013|2pp=196&amp;ndash;197|3a1=Bogdan|3y=2015|3p=5}} as well as for [[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Richard Cavendish]]'s ''[[Man, Myth &amp; Magic (encyclopedia)|Man, Myth &amp; Magic]]''.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=5}} Many of these articles would be collected into a single anthology and published as ''At the Feet of the Guru'' in 2005.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=5}} Grant believed that the O.T.O.'s [[sex magic]] teachings needed to be refashioned along [[Tantra|tantric]] principles from Indian religion,{{sfnm|1a1=Bogdan|1y=2010|1pp=xxxviii&amp;ndash;xxxix|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2013|2pp=196&amp;ndash;197}} in doing so relying heavily on Curwen's ideas about tantra.{{sfn|Bogdan|2010|pp=xxxviii&amp;ndash;xxxix}}

After Spare's death, Grant began to focus more on his own writing career.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=306}} From 1959 to 1963, Grant privately published the ''Carfax Monographs'', a series of short articles on magic published in ten installments, each at a limited print run of 100.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=306|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2015|2pp=5&amp;ndash;6}} Nine of these volumes included original artworks produced by Steffi, reflecting the increasing collaboration between husband and wife which would be reflected in many of Grant's subsequent publications.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=6}} The ''Carfax Monographs'' would eventually be assembled together and re-released as ''Hidden Lore'' in 1989.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=306|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2015|2p=6}} In 1966 he also privately published a small book of his poems, ''Black to Black and Other Poems''.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=5}} During the 1950s and 1960s Grant also authored a number of novellas, although these would only be published by Starfire Publishing between 1997 and 2012.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=6}}

===Typhonian O.T.O. and growing fame: 1970&amp;ndash;2011===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="Of all OHO contenders, [Grant] made the greatest effort to expand and build upon Crowley's work rather than confine himself to the letter of the law. During the 1970s, he was only one of a handful of people editing material by Crowley and Austin Spare, and he was practically alone in offering new contributions to the literature of magick. While his system differs considerably from Crowley's, he gets high marks for originality."|source=&amp;ndash; Crowley biographer [[Richard Kaczynski]], 2010.{{sfn|Kaczynski|2010|p=557}}}}

In 1969, Grant co-edited ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'' for publication with Crowley's literary executor [[John Symonds]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kaczynski|1y=2010|1p=557|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2015|2p=6}} Over the coming years he edited &amp;ndash; often with Symonds &amp;ndash; a range of Crowley writings for republication, resulting in the release of ''The Magical Record of the Beast 666'' (1972), ''[[Diary of a Drug Fiend]]'' (1972), ''[[Moonchild (novel)|Moonchild]]'' (1972), ''Magick'' (1973), ''Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on The Book of the Law'' (1974) and ''The Complete Astrological Writings'' (1974).{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=6}} The release of these publications has been described as being "instrumental in the revival of interest in Crowley".{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=6}}

At this point, Grant began describing himself as the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of the O.T.O., claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because he displayed the inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked.{{sfn|Kaczynski|2010|p=557}} A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member.{{sfn|Staley|2008|p=121}} In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|pp=6&amp;ndash;7}} Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the rituals of initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=7}}

In 1972, Frederick Muller Limited published the first book in Grant's "Typhonian Trilogies" series, ''[[The Magical Revival]]'', in which he discussed various events within the history of Western esotericism while also encouraging future interest in the subject.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1pp=306&amp;ndash;307|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2015|2p=7}} He followed this with a sequel published in 1973, ''Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God'', in which he examined Crowley's sex magical practices and the Tantra.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=307}} This was followed in 1975 by ''Cults of the Shadow'', which brought the first Typhonian Trilogy to an end with a discussion of the [[Left Hand Path]] in magic, making reference to both Crowley and Spare's work, as well as to [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]] and Tantra.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=307}} That same year, Grant also published ''Images and Oracles of Austin Osman Spare'', a collection of his late friend's images based on 20 years of research. The volume did not sell well, with much of the stock being remaindered, although became a rare collector's item in later years.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=307}} Grant had begun work on the book many years before, and had agreed for 500 copies to be published by Trigram Press Ltd in 1967, although at the last minute the project was cancelled.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=4}} He had also authored new introductions for re-releases of two of Spare's works, a 1973 publication of ''[[The Anathema of Zos]]'' and a 1975 release of ''[[The Book of Pleasure]]''.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=6}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="The works of Kenneth Grant are fashioned out of the stuff of dreams. The neat and orderly appearance on the shelves of the Typhonian Trilogies gives no hint of the eldritch worlds they contain. One opens each volume with a sense of wonder, and one finishes them with the material for nightmares and visions of worlds yet unborn."|source=&amp;ndash; Martin P. Starr, 2003.{{sfn|Starr|2015|p=xi}}}}

In 1977, Grant began the second Typhonian Trilogy with ''Nightside of Eden'', in which he discussed some of his own personal magical ideas, outlining magical formulae with which to explore a dark, dense realm that he variously called 'Universe B' and 'the Tunnels of Set', conceived as a 'dark side' of the Qabalistic [[Tree of Life]]. Grant made connections between this realm and the extramundane deities of [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s horror fiction. The book proved controversial among occultists and Thelemites, and starkly divided opinion.{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=307&amp;ndash;308}} The sequel appeared in 1980 as ''Outside the Circles of Time'', and introduced Grant's thoughts on the relevance of [[Ufology]] and insectoid symbolism for occultism.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=308}} This would prove to be the final Grant volume published by Muller, who would merge with [[Blond and Briggs]] in 1984,{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=7|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2015|2p=7}} while the publishing rights to his works reverted to him the following year.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=7}} His next book would not appear for another eleven years after ''Outside the Circles of Time''.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=308}}

In 1989, Grant began his relationship with Skoob Books Limited, a publisher linked to the Skoob Books bookstore in [[Bloomsbury]], central London which had begun to develop a line of esoteric titles under the leadership of Caroline Wise and Chris Johnson.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=8}} In 1991, Skoob Books published Grant's ''Remembering Aleister Crowley'', a volume containing his memoirs of Crowley alongside reproductions of diary entries, photographs, and letters.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=308}} From 1989 to 1994, Skoob reissued a number of Grant's earlier books,{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=308|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2015|2p=8}} and in 1992 published the sixth volume in the Typhonian Trilogies, ''Hecate's Fountain'', in which Grant provided many anecdotes about working in the New Isis Lodge and focused on describing accidents and fatalities that he believed were caused by magic.{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=308&amp;ndash;309}} The seventh volume of the Typhonian Trilogies, ''Outer Gateways'', followed in 1994, discussing Grant's ideas of older Typhonian traditions from across the world, with reference to the work of Crowley, Spare, and Lovecraft. It ends with the text of ''The Wisdom of S'lba'', a work that Grant claimed he had received [[clairvoyance|clairvoyantly]] from a supernatural source.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=309}}

After Skoob Books closed its esoteric publishing division, in 1996 Grant transferred the publishing rights of his books to two companies, Starfire Publishing &amp;ndash; which decided to bring out his trilogies and novellas &amp;ndash; and [[Fulgur Limited]], which published his work on Spare.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|pp=8&amp;ndash;9}}
In 1997 Starfire published Grant's first novel, ''Against the Light: A Nightside Narrative'', which involved a character also named "Kenneth Grant". He asserted that the work was "quasi-autobiographical", but never specified which parts were based on his life and which were fictional.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=309}} In 1998, Starfire published a book co-written by Grant and his wife Steffi, titled ''Zos Speaks! Encounters with Austin Osman Spare'', in which they included 7 years' worth of diary entries, letters, and photographs pertaining to their relationship with the artist.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1pp=309&amp;ndash;310|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2015|2p=9}} The following year, the next volume in the Typhonian Trilogies, ''Beyond the Mauve Zone'' was published, explaining Grant's ideas on a realm known as the Mauve Zone that he claimed to have explored.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=310}} A book containing two novellas, ''Snakewand and the Darker Strain'', was published in 2000, while the final volume of the Typhonian Trilogies, ''The Ninth Arch'', was published in 2003. It offered further Qabalistic interpretations of the work of Crowley, Spare, and Lovecraft, and the text of another work that Grant claimed had been given to him from a supernatural source, ''Book of the Spider''.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=310}} That same year, Grant also published two further volumes of fictional stories, ''Gamaliel and Dance, Doll, Dance!'', which told the story of a vampire and a Tantric sex group, and ''The Other Child, and Other Tales'', which contained six short stories.{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=310&amp;ndash;311}}

Grant died on 15 January 2011 after a period of illness.{{sfnm|1a1=Anon|1y=2011|2a1=O'Neill|2y=2011}} He was survived by his wife.{{sfn|Anon|2011}}

==Beliefs and teachings==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="In his body of work, Grant has created an unlikely mélange {{sic|comprised|hide=y| of}} thematic threads that include both Eastern and Western esoteric traditions, in addition to consistent references to artistic and literary works infused with the aroma of the mysterious, fantastic, and uncanny, with a dominant place assigned to the fictional output of H. P. Lovecraft and the visionary creations of Austin O. Spare."|source=&amp;ndash; The religious studies scholar Gordan Djurdjevic.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=91}}}}

Although based in Thelema, Grant's Typhonian tradition has been described as "a ''bricolage'' of occultism, Neo-Vedanta, Hindu tantra, Western sexual magic, Surrealism, ufology and Lovecraftian gnosis".{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=1}}

Grant promoted what he termed the Typhonian or Draconian tradition of magic,{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=95}} and claimed that Thelema was only a recent manifestation of this wider tradition.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=106}} In his books, he portrayed the Typhonian tradition as the world's oldest spiritual tradition, claiming that it had ancient roots in Africa.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=96}} According to Grant, Typhonianism was typified by its worship of female deities and its use of sex as a method of spiritual achievement.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=96}} He claimed that this tradition spread throughout the world, forming the basis of forms of ancient Egyptian religion as well as Indian Tantra and forms of Western esotericism.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=96}} He added that for millennia, the Typhonian tradition has been opposed by the "Osirians" or "Solarites", practitioners of patriarchal and solar religions, who have portrayed the Typhonians as evil, corrupt, and debauched.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=96}} The religious studies scholar Gordan Djurdjevic noted that Grant's historical claims regarding Typhonian history were "at best highly speculative" and lacked any supporting evidence, however he suggested that Grant may never have intended these claims to be taken literally.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=109}}

Grant's claims that Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga correlate to Western esoteric traditions, and that both stem from a core, ancient source, has parallels in the [[perennial philosophy]] promoted by the [[Traditionalist School]] of esotericists.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|pp=92–93}} However, Grant differed from Traditionalists like [[René Guénon]] and [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] in his positive assessment of Western occultism.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=93}} Moreover, Grant's appreciation of Asian spiritual traditions has much in common with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], although Grant differed from the Theosophical movement with his valorisation of the 'left hand path'.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=95}}

Influenced by Maharshi, Grant adopted the [[Advaitan]] world-view that only "the Self", or ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]'', really exists, with the wider universe being an illusory projection.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|pp=96–97}} He believed that by mastering magick, one master's this illusory universe, gaining personal liberation and recognising that only the Self really exists.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=98}} Doing so, according to Grant, leads to the discovery of one's True Will, the central focus of Thelema.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=109}} Grant further claimed that the realm of the Self was known as "the Mauve Zone", and that it could be reached while in a state of deep sleep, where it has the symbolic appearance of a swamp.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=99}} He also believed that the reality of consciousness, which he deemed the only true reality, was formless and thus presented as a void, although he also taught that it was symbolised by the Hindu goddess [[Kali]] and the Thelemic goddess [[Nuit]].{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=100}}

Grant taught that the true secret of sex magic were bodily secretions, the most important of which was a woman's menstrual blood.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=96}} He referred to female sexual secretions as ''kalas'', a term adopted from [[Sanskrit]].{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=107}}

==Legacy==

Janine Chapman, an esotericist who met Grant during the 1970s, described him as "an attractive, well-mannered, well-dressed man in his forties, intelligent, cultivated, and friendly."{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=144}} While highlighting Grant's reclusive character,{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=285}} the historian Dave Evans noted that Grant was "certainly unique" in the history of British esotericism because of his "close dealings" with Crowley, Spare, and Gardner, the "three most influential Western occultists of the 20th century."{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=284}} The occultist and comic book author [[Alan Moore]] thought it "hard to name" any other living individual who "has done more to shape contemporary western thinking with regard to Magic" than Grant,{{sfn|Moore|2002|p=162}} thinking him "a schoolboy gone berserk on brimstone aftershave."{{sfn|Moore|2002|p=156}}

In 2003, the historian of Western esotericism Henrik Bogdan expressed the view that Grant was "perhaps (the) most original and prolific English author of the post-modern occultist genre."{{sfn|Bogdan|2003|p=viii}} Djurdjevic stated that Grant's engagement with Indian spiritual traditions was "both substantial and innovative" as well as controversial,{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=108}} while adding that Grant's emphasis on the importance of female sexual fluids helped contribute to the "transformation of the hegemonic masculinity" in Western occultism.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=110}}
Although membership of Grant's own occult groups remained small, his Typhonian Thelema represented a significant influence over various other occult groups and currents.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=1}} They included [[chaos magic]],{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=285}} as well as the [[Temple of Set]],{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=1}} the [[Dragon Rouge]],{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=1}} and [[Andrew D. Chumbley]]'s Cultus Sabbati.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=1}} The anthropologist Justin Woodman noted that Grant was "one of the key figures" for bringing Lovecraft's work into magical theory and practice,{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=18}} adding that his writings were a "formative influence" on Lovecraftian groups like the [[Esoteric Order of Dagon]], founded in North America during the late 1980s.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=19}}

The occultist [[Peter Levenda]] discussed Grant's work in his 2013 book, ''The Dark Lord''. Here, he asserted that Grant's importance was in attempting to create "a more global character for Thelema" by introducing ideas from Indian Tantra, [[Yezidism]], and Afro-Caribbean syncretic religions.{{sfn|Levenda|2013|p=60}}

==Bibliography==
Grant published his work over a period of five decades, providing both a synthesis of Crowley and Spare's work and new, often idiosyncratic interpretations of them.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=284}} Evans described Grant as having "an often confusing, oblique, and sanity-challenging writing style" that blends fictional stories with accounts of real-life people.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=285}}

In 2003, Bogdan's first edition of a Grant bibliography was published by Academia Esoterica Press.{{sfn|Bogdan|2015|p=10}} This was followed by a second, updated edition in 2015, which contained a full biography of Grant's work:{{sfn|Bogdan|2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8895">'''Knowledge translation''' ('''KT''') is the umbrella term for all of the activities involved in moving research from the [[laboratory]], the [[Academic journal|research journal]], and the [[academic conference]] into the hands of people and organizations who can put it to practical use. The term is most often used relative to the [[Outline of health sciences|health professions]], including [[medicine]], [[nursing]], pharmaceuticals, [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]], and [[public health]].

Depending on the type of research being translated, the "practical user" might be a medical doctor, a nurse, a teacher, a school administrator, an occupational or [[Physical therapy|physical therapist]], a legislator, an [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]], a community health worker, or a parent.

KT is not an action, but a spectrum of activities which will change according to the [[Types of research methods and disciplines|type of research]], the [[Time|time frame]], and the audience being targeted.

==Definitions==
The most widely used definition of knowledge translation was published in 2000 by the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (CIHR): "Knowledge translation (KT) is defined as a dynamic and iterative process that includes synthesis, dissemination, exchange and ethically-sound application of knowledge to improve the health of Canadians, provide more effective health services and products and strengthen the health care system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Government of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Knowledge Translation |url=http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/29418.html |title=About Knowledge Translation - CIHR |publisher=Cihr-irsc.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the CIHR definition as a basis, the [[National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research|National Center for the Dissemination of Disability Research]] (NCDDR) published this definition of KT in 2005: "The collaborative and systematic review, assessment, identification, aggregation, and practical application of high-quality disability and rehabilitation research by key stakeholders (i.e., consumers, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers) for the purpose of improving the lives of individuals with disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Center for the Dissemination of Disability Research |url=http://www.ncddr.org/knowledge_trans_over.html |title=NCDDR Knowledge Translation |publisher=Ncddr.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Graham, et al., acknowledged the proliferation of related terms for the activity of knowledge translation, documenting 29 different terms used by 33 different health research funding agencies in their publications, including knowledge transfer, [[knowledge mobilization]], knowledge exchange, implementation, and translational research.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, et al. (2006). The Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Professions, Volume 26, pp. 13–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, NCDDR re-published an overview written by Pimjai Sudsawad, then with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, now with the U.S. Department of Education, entitled: "Knowledge Translation: Introduction to Models, Strategies, and Measures".&lt;ref&gt;Sudsawad, P. (2007). Knowledge translation: Introduction to models, strategies, and measures. Austin, TX: Southwest Educational Development Laboratory, National Center for the Dissemination of Disability Research.&lt;/ref&gt; The overview correlates a variety of KT models which have been in development since at least 1976, including the Stetler Model of Research Utilization, the Coordinated Implementation Model, the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework, the Ottawa Model of Research Utilization (OMRU), and the Knowledge to Action (KTA) process framework.

==History==
The activity of knowledge translation is observable as far back as [[agricultural extension]] services established by the [[Smith-Lever Act of 1914]]. The Smith-Lever Act formalized the relationship between United States [[land-grant universities]] and the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) for the performance of agricultural extension. Agricultural extension agents based at the land-grant universities disseminated information to farmers and ranchers on seed development, land management and animal husbandry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Research Into Action - A Knowledge Translation Initiative| url=https://ktexchange.sph.uth.tmc.edu/knowledge_translation_history.aspx |title=History of Knowledge Translation |publisher=Ktexchange.org |year= 2005 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their Technical Brief #10 2005, NCDDR points out: "KT is a relatively new term that is used to describe a relatively old problem - the underutilization of evidence-based research in systems of care. Underutilization of evidence-based research is often described as a gap between 'what is known' and 'what is currently done' in practice settings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Center for the Dissemination of Disability Research|url=http://www.ncddr.org/kt/products/focus/focus10/Focus10.pdf |title=Focus10Final.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milbank Mem Fund Q Health Soc 1966; 44:166–206.&lt;/ref&gt; institutional interest in this long-standing issue has accelerated in the last 25 years. In 1989, the U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] established the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]]. In 1997, the Canadian government endowed the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (CHSRF) - now called the [[Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement]], or CFHI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfhi-fcass.ca/AboutUs/History.aspx  "History",  Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement.  On line.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Canadian government consolidated several existing agencies into the [[Canadian Institutes for Health Research]]. In 2006, the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] created the [[Clinical and Translational Science Awards]], currently funding about 60 academic medical institutions across the country. The role of health research funders is increasingly playing a role in how evidence is being moved to practice, reducing the time between research and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, B, Schellenberg, M, Schell, K, Scarrow, G.

More recently, the challenges of filtering information for knowledge translation is being increasingly addressed with Moloney, Taylor &amp; Ralph proposing a "[http://www.ajan.com.au/Vol34/Issue1/3Moloney.pdf spillway model]" to better control information flow and improve the implementation of research in healthcare. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajan.com.au/Vol34/Issue1/3Moloney.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other recent studies look at the role of design artefacts such as sketches, visual representations and prototypes to support knowledge translation in research and development projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simeone|first=Luca|last2=Secundo|first2=Giustina|last3=Schiuma|first3=Giovanni|date=2017|title=Knowledge translation mechanisms in open innovation: the role of design in R&amp;D projects|url=|journal=Journal of Knowledge Management|volume=21|issue=6|pages=1406-1429|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Equity (law)}}
'''Maxims of equity''' are [[legal maxim]]s that serve as a set of general [[principles of law|principles]] or rules which are said to govern the way in which [[Equity (law)|equity]] operates. They tend to illustrate the qualities of [[Equity (law)|equity]], in contrast to the [[common law]], as a more flexible, responsive approach to the needs of the individual, inclined to take into account the [[Party (law)|parties’]] conduct and worthiness. They were developed by the English [[Court of Chancery]] and other courts that administer [[Equity (law)|equity]] jurisdiction, including the [[English trusts law|law of trusts]]. Although the most fundamental and time honored of the maxims, listed on this page, are often referred to on their own as the 'maxims of equity' or 'the equitable maxims', it cannot be said that there is a definitive list of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trusts and Equity|first1=Richard|last1= Edwards|first2= Nigel|last2= Stockwell|year= 2005|publisher=Pearson Education|edition=7|pages=34|isbn=1-4058-1227-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/assets/hip/gb/uploads/M02_EDWA3458_10_SE_C02.pdf. - The maxims of equity&lt;/ref&gt; Like other kinds of [[legal maxim]]s or [[principles of law|principles]], they were originally, and sometimes still are, expressed in Latin.

==Role of maxims==
Maxims of equity are not a rigid set of rules, but are, rather, general principles which can be deviated from in specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;See J Martin, ''Hanbury and Martin's Modern Equity'' (19th edn Sweet and Maxwell 2012) 1-024&lt;/ref&gt; Snell's ''Equity'', an English treatise, takes the view that the "Maxims do not cover the whole ground, and moreover they overlap, one maxim contains by implication what belongs to another. Indeed it would not be difficult to reduce all under two: '[[#Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy|Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy]]' and '[[#Equity acts in personam   or persons|Equity acts on the person]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Snell's Principles of Equity|edition  =  25 |last1=Snell|first1=Edmund Henry Turner|last2= Megarry|first2=R.E.|last3=Baker|first3= P.V. |year= 1960|publisher= Sweet &amp; Maxwell|location= London|ol=21567635M |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of maxims==
===Equity sees that as done what ought to be done===
Sometimes phrased as "equity regards as done what should have been done", this maxim means that when individuals are required, by their agreements or by law, to perform some act of legal significance, equity will regard that act as having been done as it ought to have been done, even before it has actually happened. This makes possible the legal phenomenon of [[equitable conversion]].

The consequences of this maxim, and of equitable conversion, are significant in their bearing on the [[risk of loss]] in transactions. When parties enter a contract for a sale of [[Realty|real property]], the buyer is deemed to have obtained an equitable right that becomes a legal right only after the deal is completed.

Due to his [[equitable interest]] in the outcome of the transaction, the buyer who suffers a breach may be entitled to the [[equitable remedy]] of [[specific performance]] (although not always, see below).  If he is successful in seeking a remedy at law, he is entitled to the value of the property at the time of breach regardless of whether it has appreciated or depreciated.

The fact that the buyer may be forced to suffer a depreciation in the value of the property means that he bears the risk of loss if, for example, the improvements on the property he bought burn down while he is still in [[escrow]].

Problems may sometimes arise because, through some lapse or omission, insurance coverage is not in force at the time a claim is made. If the policyholder has clearly been at fault in this connection, because, for example, he has not paid premiums when he should have, then it will normally be quite reasonable for an insurer to decline to meet the claim. However, it gets more difficult if the policyholder is no more at fault than the insurer. The fair solution in the circumstances may be arrived at by applying the principle that equity regards that as done that ought to be done. In other words, what would the position have been if what should have been done had been done?

Thus, we know in one case, premiums on a [[life insurance]] policy were overdue. The insurer's letter to the policyholder warning him of this fact was never received by the policyholder, who died shortly after the policy consequently lapsed. It was clear that if the notice had been received by the policyholder, he or his wife would have taken steps to ensure the policy continued in force, because the policyholder was terminally ill at the time and the coverage provided by the policy was something his wife was plainly going to require in the foreseeable future. Since the policyholder would have been fully entitled to pay the outstanding premium at that stage, regardless of his physical condition, the insurer (with some persuasion from the Bureau) agreed that the matter should be dealt with as if the policyholder had done so. In other words, his widow was entitled to the sum assured less the outstanding premium. In other similar cases, however, it has not been possible to follow the same principle because there has not been sufficiently clear evidence that the policy would have been renewed.

Another illustration of the application of this equitable principle was in connection with [[motor vehicle insurance]]. A policyholder was provided with coverage on the basis that she was entitled to a "no claims" discount from her previous insurer. Confirmation to this effect from the previous insurer was required. When that was not forthcoming, her coverage was cancelled by the brokers who had issued the initial coverage note. This was done without reference to the insurer concerned whose normal practice in such circumstances would have been to maintain coverage and to require payment of the full premium until proof of the no claims discount was forthcoming. Such proof was eventually obtained by the policyholder, but only after she had been involved in an accident after the cancellation by the brokers of the policy. Here again, the fair outcome was to look at what would have happened if the insurer's normal practice had been followed. In such circumstances, the policyholder would plainly have still had a policy at the time of the accident. The insurer itself had not acted incorrectly at any stage. However, in the circumstances, it was equitable for it to meet the claim.

===Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy===
When seeking an equitable relief, the one that has been wronged has the stronger hand. The stronger hand is the one that has the capacity to ask for a [[legal remedy]] (judicial relief). In equity, this form of remedy is usually one of [[specific performance]] or an [[injunction]] (injunctive relief). These are superior remedies to those administered at common law such as [[damages]]. The [[Latin]] [[legal maxim]] is ''ubi jus ibi remedium'' ("where there is a wrong, there must be a remedy"), sometimes cited as '''''ubi jus ibi remediam'''''.

The maxim is necessarily subordinate to positive principles and cannot be applied either to subvert established rules of law or to give the courts a [[jurisdiction]] hitherto unknown, and it is only in a general not in a literal sense that the maxim has force.

[[Case law]] dealing with the principle of this maxim at law include ''[[Ashby v White]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ashby v White]]'' (1703) 92 ER 126&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents]]'', {{ussc|403|388|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of this principle at law was key in the decision of ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein it was necessary to establish that [[William Marbury|Marbury]] had a right to his commission in the first place in order for [[John Marshall|Chief Justice Marshall]] to make his more wide-ranging decision.

===Equity delights in equality/Equality is equity (''Aequalitus est quasi equitas'')===


Where two persons have an equal right, the property will be divided equally. 

This maxim flows from the fundamental notion of equality or impartiality due to the conception of Equity and is the source of many equitable doctrines. The maxim is of very wide application. The rule of ordinary law may give one party an advantage over the other. But, the court of equity where it can, put the litigating parties on a footing of equality. Equity proceeds in the principle that a right or liability should as far as possible, be equalized among all interested.
In the Simple Word's then Two parties have equal Rights in any of property so the same was distributed equal as per their concerned Law.

===One who seeks equity must do equity===
To receive [[equitable relief]], the petitioning party must be willing to complete all of its own obligations as well. The applicant to a court of equity is just as much subject to the power of that court as the defendant. This maxim may also overlap with the [[#One who comes into equity must come with clean hands|clean hands maxim]] (see below).

===Equity aids the vigilant not the indolent===
''Vigilantibus non dormientibus aequitas subvenit''.

A person who has been wronged must act relatively swiftly to preserve their rights. Otherwise, they are guilty of [[Laches (equity)|laches]], an untoward delay in litigation with the presumed intent of denying claims.  This differs from a [[statute of limitations]], in that a delay is particularized to individual situations, rather than a general prescribed legal amount of time.  In addition, even where a limitation period has not yet run, laches may still occur.  The equitable rule of laches and acquiescence was first introduced in ''[[Chief Young Dede v. African Association Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chief Young Dede v. African Association Ltd]]'' (1910) 1 N.L.R 130 at 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives:
*Delay defeats equity
*Equity aids the vigilant, not those who sleep on their rights

===Equity imputes an intent to fulfill an obligation===
Generally speaking, near performance of a general [[obligation]] will be treated as sufficient unless the law requires perfect performance, such as in the exercise of an option. Text writers give an example of a [[debtor]] leaving a [[legacy (property law)|legacy]] to his [[creditor]] equal to or greater than his obligation. Equity regards such a [[gift]] as performance of the obligation so the creditor cannot claim both the legacy and payment of the [[debt]].
  
Where a claimant is under an obligation to do one thing but does another, his action may be treated as close enough approximation of the required act. A claimant who has undertaken an obligation, will, through his later conduct be interpreted as fulfilment of that obligation.

===Equity acts ''in personam'' (i.e. on persons rather than on objects)===
In England, there was a distinction drawn between the jurisdiction of the law courts and that of the chancery court. Courts of law had jurisdiction over [[in rem|property]] as well as [[in personam|persons]] and their coercive power arose out of their ability to adjust ownership rights. Courts of equity had power over [[in personam|persons]]. Their coercive power arose from the ability, on authority of the crown, to hold a violator in [[Contempt of court|contempt]], and take away his or her freedom (or money) until he or she purged himself or herself of his or her contumacious behavior. This distinction helped preserve a separation of powers between the two courts.

Nevertheless, courts of equity also developed a doctrine that an applicant must assert a "property interest". This was a limitation on their own power to issue relief. This does not mean that the courts of equity had taken jurisdiction over property. Rather, it means that they came to require that the applicant assert a right of some significant substance as opposed to a claim for relief based on an injury to mere emotional or dignitary interests.

===Equity abhors a forfeiture===
Today, a mortgagor refers to his interest in the property as his "equity". The origin of the concept, however, was actually a mirror-image of the current practice.

At [[common law]], a [[mortgage]] was a [[conveyancing|conveyance]] of the [[property]], with a [[condition subsequent]], that if the grantor paid the secured indebtedness to the grantee on or before a date certain (the "law" day) then the conveyance would be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect. As was inevitable, debtors would be unable to pay on the law day, and if they tendered the debt after the time had passed, the creditor owed no duty to give the land back. So then the debtor would run to the court of equity, plead that there was an unconscionable forfeiture about to occur, and beg the court to grant an equitable decree requiring the lender to surrender the property upon payment of the [[secured debt]] with interest to date. And the equity courts granted these petitions quite regularly and often without regard for the amount of time that had lapsed since the law day had passed. The lender could interpose a defense of [[laches (equity)|laches]], saying that so much time had gone by (and so much improvement and betterment had taken place) that it would be inequitable to require undoing the finality of the mortgage conveyance. Other defenses, including [[equitable estoppel]], were used to bar redemption as well.

This unsettling system had a negative impact on the willingness of lenders to accept real estate as collateral security for loans. Since a lender could not re-sell the property until it had been in uncontested possession for years, or unless it could show changed circumstances, the value of real estate collateral was significantly impaired. Impaired, that is, until lawyers concocted the bill of foreclosure, whereby a mortgagee could request a decree that unless the mortgagor paid the debt by a date certain (and after the law date set in the mortgage), the mortgagor would thereafter be barred and foreclosed of all right, [[Title (property)|title]] and [[equity of redemption]] in and to the mortgaged premises.

To complete the circle, one needs to understand that when a mortgagor fails to pay an installment when due, and the mortgagee accelerates the mortgage, requiring immediate repayment of the entire mortgage indebtedness, the mortgagor does not have a right to pay the past-due installment(s) and have the mortgage reinstated. In ''[[Graf v. Hope Building Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Graf v. Hope Building Corp.]]'', 254 NY 1 (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[New York Court of Appeals]] observed that in such a case, there was no forfeiture, only the operation of a clause fair on its face, to which the mortgagor had freely assented. In the latter 20th Century, New York's lower courts eroded the ''Graf'' doctrine to such a degree that it appears that it is no longer the law, and that a court of conscience has the power to mandate that a default be excused if it is equitable to do so. Of course, now that the pendulum is swinging in the opposite direction, we can expect courts to explain where the limits on the newly expanded equity of redemption lie...and it is probably not a coincidence that the cases that have eroded ''[[Graf v. Hope Building Corp.]]'' have been accompanied by the rise of [[arbitration]] as a means for enforcing mortgages.&lt;ref&gt;See Osborne, ''Real Estate Finance Law'' (West, 1979), Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equity does not require an idle gesture===
Also: Equity will not compel a court to do a vain and useless thing. It would be an idle gesture for the court to grant [[reformation of a contract]] and then to deny to the prevailing party an opportunity to perform it as modified.

===He who comes into equity must come with clean hands===
It is often stated that one who comes into equity must come with [[Unclean hands|clean hands]] (or alternatively, equity will not permit a party to profit by his own wrong). In other words, if you ask for help about the actions of someone else but have acted wrongly, then you do not have clean hands and you may not receive the help you seek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII| |court=UKHL |year=1993 |num=3 |litigants=Tinsley v Milligan |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if you desire your tenant to vacate, you must have not violated the tenant's rights.

However, the requirement of clean hands does not mean that a "bad person" cannot obtain the aid of equity. "Equity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless lives."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Loughran v. Loughran]]'', {{ussc|292|216|1934|pin=229}}, ([[Louis Brandeis|Brandeis, J.]])&lt;/ref&gt; The defense of unclean hands only applies if there is a nexus between the applicant's wrongful act and the rights he wishes to enforce.

In ''[[D &amp; C Builders Ltd v Rees]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[D &amp; C Builders Ltd v Rees]] |year=1965 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=3 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a small building firm did some work on the house of a couple named Rees. The bill came to £732, of which the Rees had already paid £250. When the builders asked for the balance of £482, the Rees announced that the work was defective, and they were only prepared to pay £300.&lt;ref&gt; Mrs Rees: "My husband will pay you £300. It is all you'll get. It is to be in satisfaction".&lt;/ref&gt;  As the builders were in serious financial difficulties (as the Rees knew), they reluctantly accepted the £300 "in completion of the account". The decision to accept the money would not normally be binding in contract law, and afterwards the builders sued the Rees for the outstanding amount. The Rees claimed that the court should apply the doctrine of [[equitable estoppel|promissory estoppel]],&lt;ref&gt;Promissory estoppel was established by Denning J in ''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]]'' [1947] [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 130.&lt;/ref&gt; which can make promises binding even when unsupported by consideration. However, [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] refused to apply the doctrine, on the grounds that the Rees had taken unfair advantage of the builders' financial difficulties, and therefore had not come "with clean hands".

===Equity delights to do justice and not by halves===
When a court of equity is presented with a good claim to equitable relief, and it is clear that the plaintiff ''also'' sustained monetary damages, the court of equity has jurisdiction to render legal relief, e.g., monetary damages. Hence equity does not stop at granting equitable relief, but goes on to render a full and complete collection of remedies.

===Equity will take jurisdiction to avoid a multiplicity of suits===
Thus, "where a court of equity has all the parties before it, it will adjudicate upon all of the rights of the parties connected with the subject matter of the action, so as to avoid a multiplicity of suits."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burnworth v. Hughes]]'', {{West|P|670|2|917|Kan.|1983|922}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the basis for the procedures of [[interpleader]], [[class action]], and the more rarely used [[Bill of Peace]].

===Equity follows the law===
This maxim, also expressed as ''Aequitas sequitur legem'', means more fully that "equity will not allow a remedy that is contrary to law."

The [[Court of Chancery]] never claimed to override the courts of common law. [[Joseph Story|Story]] states "where a rule, either of the common or the statute law is direct, and governs the case with all its circumstances, or the particular point, a court of equity is as much bound by it as a court of law, and can as little justify a departure from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Story|first1=Joseph|last2=Randell|first2=Alfred Edward
|title=Story on Equity''|edition= third English|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|year= 1920 |page= 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edmund Henry Turner Snell]],  “It is only when there is some important circumstance disregarded by the common law rules that equity interferes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Snell's Principles of Equity|edition  =  20 |last1=Snell|first1=Edmund Henry Turner|last2= |first2= |last3=|first3=|year=1929 |publisher= Sweet &amp; Maxwell|location= London
|ol= |page=24}} quoted in Williams, James (1932). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Yc6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA166 ''The Statute of Frauds''], p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Cardozo|Cardozo]] wrote in his dissent in ''[[Graf v. Hope Building Corporation]]'', 254 N.Y 1 at 9 (1930), "Equity works as a supplement for law and does not supersede the prevailing law."

[[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]] says, “We ought not to think of common law and equity as of two rival systems."&lt;ref&gt;Maitland, Frederic William (1932). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CTk9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA19 ''Equity; Also the Forms of Action at Common Law: Two Courses of Lectures''], p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; "Equity [[Matthew 5:17|had come not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it]]. [[Matthew 5:18|Every jot and every title]] of law was to be obeyed, but when all this had been done yet something might be needful, something that equity would require."&lt;ref&gt;Maitland (1932), p. 17. {{full|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of law and equity was the same but due to historical reasons they chose a different path.  Equity respected every word of law and every right at law but where the law was defective, in those cases, equity provides equitable right and remedies.

In the Province of Ontario, Canada, instead of equity following the law, the law follows equity – as per the Ontario Courts of Justice Act:

(2) ''Where a rule of equity conflicts with a rule of the common law, the rule of equity prevails.'' R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, s. 96 (2); 1993, c. 27, Sched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c43#BK132|title=Law Document English View|date=2014-07-24|newspaper=Ontario.ca|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equity will not assist a volunteer ===
A volunteer is defined in equity as one who has not offered [[consideration]] for a benefit they have received or expect to receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Australian Law Dictionary 2nd ed|last=Mann|first=Trischa|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780195518511|location=Australia|pages=756}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a person A expects from past conversations and friendship to receive property under any will of person B, but person B dies before writing this into their will, person A, having not made any contribution to person B, will not be able to seek equity's aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1990|litigants=Corin v Patton |parallelcite=(1990) 169 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 540 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This maxim is very important in restitution. [[Restitution]] developed as a series of writs called special [[assumpsit]], which were later additions in the courts of law, and were more flexible tools of recovery, based on equity. Restitution could provide means of recovery when people bestowed benefits on one another (such as giving money or providing services) according to contracts that would have been legally unenforceable.

However, pursuant to the equitable maxim, restitution does not allow a volunteer or "officious intermeddler" to recover. 

Those successfully pleading benefit from an [[estoppel]] (promise relied on to their detriment) will not be considered volunteers for the purpose of this maxim.

===Where equities are equal, the law will prevail===
Equity will provide no specific remedies where the parties' causes are to be seen to be equal, or where neither has been wronged.

The significance of this maxim is that applicants to the [[chancellor]]s often did so because of the formal [[pleading]] of the law courts, and the lack of flexibility they offered to litigants. Law courts and legislature, as lawmakers, through the limits of the substantive law they had created, thus inculcated a certain status quo that affected private conduct, and private ordering of disputes. Equity could alter that status quo, ignoring the clearly imposed limits of legal relief, or legal defences. But courts applying equity are reluctant to do so. This maxim reflects this. If the law firmly denied a [[cause of action]] or suggested equities between the parties were as a matter of policy equal, equity would provide no relief; if the law did provide relief, then the applicant would be obligated to bring a legal, rather than equitable action. This maxim overlaps with the previously mentioned "[[#Equity follows the law|equity follows the law]]."

===Between equal equities the first in order of time shall prevail===
This maxim operates where there are two or more competing equitable interests; when two equities are equal the original interest (i.e., the first in time) will succeed.

===Equity will not complete an imperfect gift===
If a donor has made an imperfect [[gift]], i.e. lacking the formalities required at [[common law]], equity will not assist the intended [[donee]]. This maxim is a subset of [[#Equity will not aid a volunteer|equity will not assist a volunteer]] .

Note the exception in ''[[Strong v Bird]]'' (1874) LR 18 Eq 315. If the donor appoints the intended donee as executor of his/her will, and the donor subsequently dies, equity will perfect the imperfect gift.

===Equity will not allow a statute to be used as a cloak for fraud===
Equity prevents a party from relying upon an absence of a [[statutory]] formality if to do so would be [[unconscionable]] and unfair. This can occur in [[secret trust]]s, [[constructive trust]]s etc.

===Equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee===
If there is no [[trustee]], whoever has legal [[title (property)|title]] to the [[trust (law)|trust]] [[property]] will be considered the trustee. Otherwise, a court may appoint a trustee.  In Ireland, the trustee may be any administrator of a [[charitable organization|charity]] to which the trust is related.

===Equity regards the beneficiary as the true owner===
Due to limits in old [[Common Law]], no remedy was had for beneficiaries if, for example, a [[trustee]] ran off with the trust [[property]]. To remedy this and protect intended recipients of trust property, Equity regarded the beneficiary as the true (eventual) owners of the [[trust (law)|trust]] property.

{{Educational assignment}}
In [[psychology]], '''mentalism''' refers to those branches of study that concentrate on perception and thought processes: for example, [[mental imagery]], [[consciousness]] and [[cognition]], as in [[cognitive psychology]]. The term ''mentalism'' has been used primarily by [[behaviorist]]s who believe that scientific psychology should focus on the structure of causal relationships to [[Classical conditioning|conditioned]] responses,&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Terry L. |date=1994 |title=Behavior and its causes: philosophical foundations of operant psychology |series=Studies in cognitive systems |volume=16 |location=Dordrecht; Boston |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |isbn=0792328159 |oclc=30158598 |doi=10.1007/978-94-015-8102-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on the functions of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carr |first=Edward G. |authorlink=Edward Gary Carr |date=Spring 1993 |title=Behavior analysis is not ultimately about behavior |journal=The Behavior Analyst |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=47–49 |pmc=2733570 |pmid=22478131 |quote=The stimulus-response (S-R) psychology of Watson (1913) is ultimately about behavior and is definitely mechanistic. The behavior-analytic approach of Skinner (1938, 1953) is not ultimately about behavior, and it is definitely not mechanistic. As operant psychologists, we are not concerned with identifying stimuli and responses that bear some fixed relationship to one another and that can be used as building blocks to explain complex behavior patterns. As operant psychologists, we are concerned, first and foremost, with the functions of behavior or, in lay terms, with purpose (Lee, 1988; Morris, 1993; Skinner, 1974), even though we do not analyze and use the term purpose as a lay person would. [...] Functionalism would have been a better term for what we are about but, unfortunately, that term has already been used to describe a school of psychology quite different from ours.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither mentalism nor behaviorism are mutually exclusive fields; elements of one can be seen in the other, perhaps more so in modern times compared to the advent of psychology over a century ago.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;{{rp|11–12, 184}}&lt;ref name="Neomentalism"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Neomentalism |last=Paivio |first=Allan |authorlink=Allan Paivio |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology |volume=29| issue=4 |year=1975 |pages=263–291 |doi=10.1037/h0082031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical mentalism==
Psychologist [[Allan Paivio]] used the term ''classical mentalism'' to refer to the [[Introspection|introspective]] psychologies of [[Edward Titchener]] and [[William James]].&lt;ref name="Neomentalism" /&gt;{{rp|263}} Despite Titchener being concerned with [[Structuralism (psychology)|structure]] and James with [[Functional psychology|function]], both agreed that consciousness was the subject matter of psychology, making psychology an inherently subjective field.&lt;ref name="Neomentalism" /&gt;{{rp|263}}

==The rise of behaviorism==
Concurrently thriving alongside mentalism since the inception of psychology was the functional perspective of behaviorism. However, it was not until 1913, when psychologist [[John B. Watson]] published his article "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It" that behaviorism began to have a dominant influence.&lt;ref name="Neomentalism" /&gt;{{rp|267}} Watson's ideas sparked what some have called a [[paradigm shift]] in American psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leahey |first=Thomas H. |date=February 1992 |title=The mythical revolutions of American psychology |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=308–318 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.2.308}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the objective and experimental study of human behavior, rather than subjective, introspective study of human consciousness. Behaviorists considered that the study of consciousness was impossible to do, and that the focus on it to that point had only been a hindrance to the field reaching its full potential. For a time, behaviorism would go on to be the dominant force driving psychological thought, advanced by the work of other luminaries such as [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[Edward Thorndike]], and [[B.F. Skinner]].

==The new mentalism==
A scathing review of B.F. Skinner's book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' by [[Noam Chomsky]] in 1959 heralded a shift back to a focus on the mental in psychology with the beginning of the [[cognitive revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trask |first=Robert Lawrence |authorlink=Larry Trask |date=2007 |chapter=Behaviorism |title=Language and linguistics: the key concepts |edition=2nd |series=Routledge key guides |location=Abingdon; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |pages=30–31 |isbn=9780415413596 |oclc=75087994 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHt-gNzagikC&amp;pg=PA30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical to the successful revival of the mind or consciousness as a primary focus of study in psychology (and in related fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience]]) were technological and methodological advances, which eventually allowed for [[brain mapping]], among other new techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dehaene |first=Stanislas |authorlink=Stanislas Dehaene |date=2014 |title=Consciousness and the brain: deciphering how the brain codes our thoughts |location=New York |publisher=Viking |isbn=9780670025435 |oclc=849719164 |page=43 |quote=In that sense, the behaviorists were right: as a method, introspection provides a shaky ground for a science of psychology, because no amount of introspection will tell us how the mind works. However, as a measure, introspection still constitutes the perfect, indeed the only, platform on which to build a science of consciousness, because it supplies a crucial half of the equation—namely, how subjects feel about some experience (however wrong they are about the ground truth). To attain a scientific understanding of consciousness, we cognitive neuroscientists "just" have to determine the other half of the equation: Which objective neurobiological events systematically underlie a person's subjective experience?}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advances provided an objectively experimental way to begin to study perception and consciousness, effectively nullifying the main criticism of mentalism half a century earlier.

However, the cognitive revolution did not kill behaviorism as a research program; in fact, research on [[operant conditioning]] actually grew at a rapid pace during the cognitive revolution.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; In 1994, scholar Terry L. Smith surveyed the history of [[radical behaviorism]] and concluded that "even though radical behaviorism may have been a failure, the operant program of research has been a success. Furthermore, operant psychology and cognitive psychology complement one another, each having its own domain within which it contributes something valuable to, but beyond the reach of, the other."&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;{{rp|xii}}

'''Mifos X''' represents the next generation of [[Mifos]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/04/18/mifos-microfinance/ |title=Microfinance: Why Open Source Means Bigger Impact | publisher=Mashable.}}&lt;/ref&gt; - it is a [[free and open source]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ohloh.net/p/mifosx |title=MifosX product | publisher=ohloh.net.}}&lt;/ref&gt; technology platform for financial inclusion of the poor.

==History==
Development of the software began as an initiative of the Grameen Foundation in 2004. At the Grameen Foundation, James Dailey and Tapan Parikh realized that the software being used by most microfinance institutions (MFIs) was outdated, expensive or otherwise fell short.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2012/04/18/mifos-microfinance Microfinance: Why Open Source Means Bigger Impact]&lt;/ref&gt; James and Tapan brainstormed something new: an open-source software that launched as Mifos in 2006. The name "Mifos" originally came from an acronym "MIcro Finance Open Source", but is now used as the brand, rather than an acronym.  Mifos existed within Grameen Foundation until 2011, when it was decided that Mifos would split off to be an independent, open-source entity.

As part of its stewardship, Mifos Initiative has developed a completely new architecture for the Mifos platform, entitled Mifos X. According to release notes for the Mifos system published on April 30, 2013, Mifos Initiative is focusing its development efforts on the new platform, and that they would not release any further official versions of the suite beyond 2.6.x.&lt;ref name="MIfos2.6.1 release notes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mifos.org/product/download-mifos|title= Mifos 2.6.1 is the first hotfix on the Esha K release }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="914">A {{nihongo||問答|'''mondō'''|Chinese: ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|wèndá}}''}} is a recorded collection of dialogues between a pupil and a ''[[rōshi]]'' (a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] teacher). Zen tradition values direct experience and communication over [[scripture]]s. (Some teachers go so far as to instruct their pupils to tear up their scriptures.) However, sometimes the ''mondō'' acts as a guide on the method of instruction.

One example of a non-Buddhist ''mondō'' is the ''Sokuratesu-no-mondō'', the Japanese translation of the "[[Socratic method]]", whereby [[Socrates]] asked his students questions in order to elicit the innate truth from assumed facts.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to critical theory:

'''[[Critical theory]]''' &amp;ndash; the examination and critique of society and culture, drawing from knowledge across the [[social science]]s and [[humanities]]. The term has two different meanings with different origins and histories: one originating in sociology and the other in literary criticism. This has led to the very literal use of 'critical theory' as an umbrella term to describe any theory founded upon critique.

Since 2010 Vardy has campaigned against the introduction of the [[English Baccalaureate]], which he argues has led to a decline in numbers taking religion studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmeduc/writev/851/ebac214.htm|title=English Baccalaureate|website=publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He views philosophy of religion as an exercise in exploring the terms left undefined by theology (such as "God" and "soul") and encouraging humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Philosophers Think|last1=Baggini|first1=Julian|last2=Stangroom|first2=Jeremy|publisher=Continuum|year=2003|location=London|pages=(114–122), 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education is a way to help young people become fully human, in his view, or good in the [[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotelian]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionreport/dr-peter-vardy-on-religion-and-values-in-education/3423284|title=Dr Peter Vardy on religion and values in education|date=8 August 2004|publisher=Radio National}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the approach in his books "What is Truth?"

A '''philosophical movement''' is either the appearance or increased popularity of a specific school of [[philosophy]], or a fairly broad but identifiable sea-change in philosophical thought on a particular subject.  Major philosophical movements are often characterized with reference to the [[nation]], [[language]], or [[historical era]] in which they arose.

Talk of a philosophical movement can often function as a shorthand for talk of the views of a great number of different [[philosopher]]s (and others associated with philosophy, such as historians, artists, scientists and political figures).  On the other hand, most philosophical movements in history consisted in a great number of individual thinkers who disagreed in various ways; it is often inaccurate and something of a caricature to treat any movement as consisting in followers of uniform opinion.  More often the defining ideas of any philosophical movement are templates on which individual thinkers develop their own particular ideas.

In contrast to the idea of a philosophical movement, the [[Renaissance]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and [[Romanticism]] are broader cultural "movements" that happened to be characterized by fairly distinctive philosophical concerns: although they are movements with philosophical cores, they extend beyond the field of philosophy into art and culture more broadly, hence are not specific enough to philosophy to be considered movements within it.

Like specific doctrines and theories, movements are often given names with "ism" suffixes.  What makes a movement identifiable and interesting as distinct from a specific theory is simply that a movement consists in a large flourishing of intellectual work on one or more ideas, in a fairly specifiable time and place. Following is short list of major philosophical movements, in rough chronological order:

{{refimprove|date=September 2011}}
The '''philosophy of biology''' is a subfield of [[philosophy of science]], which deals with [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[ethics|ethical]] issues in the biological and biomedical sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., [[Aristotle]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s. Philosophers of science then began paying increasing attention to [[biology]], from the rise of [[Neodarwinism]] in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]] in 1953 to more recent advances in [[genetic engineering]].
Other key ideas include the [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] of all life processes to [[biochemical]] reactions, and the incorporation of [[psychology]] into a broader [[neuroscience]].

==Overview==
The philosophy of biology can be seen as following an [[empiricism|empirical]] tradition, favoring [[Philosophical naturalism|naturalism]].
Many contemporary philosophers of biology have largely avoided traditional questions about the distinction between [[life]] and non-life.  Instead, they have examined the practices, [[Scientific theory|theories]], and concepts of biologists with a view toward better understanding biology as a scientific discipline (or group of scientific fields).
[[Scientific]] ideas are philosophically analyzed and their consequences are explored.  It is sometimes difficult to delineate philosophy of biology as separate from [[theoretical biology]].  A few of the questions philosophers of biology have attempted to answer, for example, include:

*"What is a biological [[species]]?"
*"How is rationality possible, given our biological origins?"
*"How do organisms coordinate their common behavior?"
*"Are there genome editing agents?"
*"How might our biological understandings of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], sexuality, and [[gender]] reflect social values?"
*"What is [[natural selection]], and how does it operate in nature?"
*"How do medical doctors explain [[disease]]?"
*"From where do [[language]] and [[logic]] stem?"
*"How is [[ecology]] related to [[medicine]]?"
&lt;!--*"What is the material basis of [[consciousness]]?"--&gt;

A subset of philosophers of biology with a more explicitly naturalistic orientation hope that biology will provide [[natural sciences|scientific]] answers to such fundamental problems of [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[anthropology]] and even [[metaphysics]].
Furthermore, progress in biology urges modern societies to rethink traditional values concerning all aspects of [[human]] [[life]]. The possibility of [[genetics|genetic]] modification of human [[stem cells]], for example, has led to an ongoing controversy on how certain biological techniques could infringe upon ethical consensus (see [[bioethics]]).
Some of the questions addressed by these philosophers of biology include:
*"What is life?"&lt;ref name="Maturana 1980"&gt;{{cite book | last=Maturana | first=Humberto | title=Autopoiesis and cognition : the realization of the living | publisher=D. Reidel | year=1980 | isbn=978-90-277-1016-1 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"What makes humans uniquely human?"
*"What is the basis of moral thinking?"
*"What are the factors we use for [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] judgments?"
*"Is evolution compatible with [[Christianity]] or other [[Religion|religious]] systems?"

Increasingly, ideas drawn from philosophical [[ontology]] and logic are being used by biologists in the domain of [[bioinformatics]]. Ontologies such as the Gene Ontology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneontology.org/|title=Gene Ontology Consortium|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are being used to annotate the results of biological experiments in a variety of model organisms in order to create logically tractable bodies of data available for reasoning and search. The Gene Ontology itself is a species-neutral graph-theoretical representation of biological types joined together by formally defined relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1186/gb-2005-6-5-r46 | pmid=15892874 | pmc=1175958 | volume=6 | issue=5 | year=2005 | journal=Genome Biology | title=Relations in biomedical ontologies | page=R46 | last1=Smith | first1=Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy of biology today has become a very visible, well-organized discipline - with its own journals, conferences, and professional organizations.  The largest of the latter is the ''International Society for the History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Biology'' (ISHPSSB);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ishpssb.org/|title=Society for the History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Biology (ISHPSSB)|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name of the Society reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the field.

==Reductionism, holism, and vitalism==
One subject within philosophy of biology deals with the relationship between reductionism and holism, contending views with [[epistemology|epistemological]] and methodological significance, but also with ethical and metaphysical connotations.

*[[Scientific reductionism]] is the view that higher-level biological processes reduce to physical and chemical processes. For example, the biological process of respiration is explained as a biochemical process involving oxygen and carbon dioxide.
*[[Holism]] is the view that emphasizes higher-level processes, also called [[emergent properties]]: phenomena at a larger level that occur due to the pattern of interactions between the elements of a system over time.  For example, to explain why one species of finch survives a drought while others die out, the holistic method looks at the entire ecosystem. Reducing an ecosystem to its parts in this case would be less effective at explaining overall behavior (in this case, the decrease in biodiversity). As individual organisms must be understood in the context of their ecosystems, holists argue, so must lower-level biological processes be understood in the broader context of the living organism in which they take part. Proponents of this view cite our growing understanding of the multidirectional and multilayered nature of [[gene modulation]] (including [[epigenetic]] changes) as an area where a reductionist view is inadequate for full explanatory power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Talbott |first=Stephen L. |title=Getting Over the Code Delusion |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/getting-over-the-code-delusion |publisher=The New Atlantis}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Holism in science]].
*[[Vitalism]] is the view, rejected by mainstream biologists since the 19th century, that there is a [[Odic force|life-force]] (called the "vis viva") that has thus far been unmeasurable scientifically that gives living organisms their "life." Vitalists often claimed that the vis viva acts with purposes according to its pre-established "form" (see [[teleology]]). Examples of vitalist philosophy are found in many [[religions]]. Mainstream biologists reject vitalism on the grounds that it opposes the [[scientific method]]. The scientific method was designed as a methodology to [[model (abstract)|build]] an extremely reliable understanding of the world, that is, a supportable, [[evidence]]d understanding.  Following this epistemological view, mainstream scientists reject phenomena that have not been scientifically measured or verified, and thus reject vitalism.

Some philosophers of biology have attempted to explain the rise and fall of reductionism, vitalism, and holism throughout the history of biology. For example, these philosophers claim that the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]] ended the last remainders of [[teleology in biology]], though the matter continues to be debated.  Debates in these areas of philosophy of biology turn on how one views reductionism.

==An autonomous philosophy of biology==
All processes in organisms obey physical laws, the difference from inanimate processes lying in their organisation and their being subject to control by coded information. This has led some biologists and philosophers (for example, [[Ernst Mayr]] and [[David Hull]]) to return to the strictly philosophical reflections of [[Charles Darwin]] to resolve some of the problems which confronted them when they tried to employ a philosophy of science derived from [[classical physics]]. This latter, [[positivist]] approach, exemplified by [[Joseph Henry Woodger]], emphasised a strict [[determinism]] (as opposed to high probability) and to the discovery of universally applicable laws, testable in the course of experiment. It was difficult for biology, beyond a basic microbiological level, to live up to these structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smocovitis |first=Vassiliki Betty |year=1996 |title=Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03343-3 |pp=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard philosophy of science seemed to leave out a lot of what characterised living organisms - namely, a historical component in the form of an inherited genotype.

Biologists with philosophic interests responded, emphasising the dual nature of the living organism. On the one hand there was the genetic programme (represented in nucleic acids) - the ''[[genotype]]''. On the other there was its extended body or ''soma'' - the ''[[phenotype]]''. In accommodating the more probabilistic and non-universal nature of biological generalisations, it was a help that standard philosophy of science was in the process of accommodating similar aspects of 20th century [[physics]].

This led to a distinction between ''proximate'' causes and explanations - "how" questions dealing with the phenotype; and ''ultimate causes'' - "why" questions, including evolutionary causes, focused on the genotype. This clarification was part of the great reconciliation, by [[Ernst Mayr]], among others, in the 1940s, between [[Darwinian evolution]] by [[natural selection]] and the [[genetics|genetic]] model of inheritance. A commitment to conceptual clarification has characterised many of these philosophers since. Trivially, this has reminded us of the scientific basis of all biology, while noting its diversity - from microbiology to ecology. A complete philosophy of biology would need to accommodate all these activities.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Less trivially, it has unpacked the notion of "[[teleology]]". Since 1859, scientists have had no need for a notion of cosmic teleology - a programme or a law that can explain and predict evolution. Darwin provided that. But teleological explanations (relating to purpose or function) have [[teleology in biology|remained stubbornly useful in biology]] - from the structural configuration of [[macromolecules]] to the study of co-operation in social systems. By clarifying and restricting the use of the term to describe and explain systems controlled strictly scientifically by genetic programmes, or other physical systems, teleological questions can be framed and investigated while remaining committed to the physical nature of all underlying organic processes.&lt;ref name=Ayala1977&gt;{{cite book |author=Ayala, Francisco J. |authorlink=Francisco J. Ayala |date=1977 |title=Teleological explanations |editor=Dobzhansky, T. |editorlink=Theodosius Dobzhansky |work=Evolution |publisher=W.H. Freeman |pages=497–504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayala 1998"&gt;[[Francisco J. Ayala|Ayala, Francisco]] (1998). "Teleological explanations in evolutionary biology."

Similar attention has been given to the concepts of ''[[natural selection]]'' (what is the target of natural selection? - the individual? the environment? the genome? the species?); ''[[adaptation]]; diversity and [[Taxonomic classification|classification]]; [[species]] and [[speciation]]''; and ''[[macroevolution]]''.

Just as [[biology]] has developed as an autonomous discipline in full conversation with the other sciences, there is a great deal of work now being carried on by biologists and philosophers to develop a dedicated philosophy of biological science which, while in full conversation with all other philosophic disciplines, attempts to give answers to the real questions raised by scientific investigations in biology.

==Other perspectives==
While the overwhelming majority of English-speaking scholars operating under the banner of "''philosophy of biology''" work within the [[English American|Anglo-American]] tradition of [[analytical philosophy]], there is a stream of philosophic work in [[continental philosophy]] which seeks to deal with issues deriving from biological science. The communication difficulties involved between these two traditions are well known, not helped by differences in language. [[Gerhard Vollmer]] is often thought of as a bridge but, despite his education and residence in Germany, he largely works in the Anglo-American tradition, particularly [[pragmatism]], and is famous for his development of [[Konrad Lorenz]]'s and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s idea of [[evolutionary epistemology]]. On the other hand, one scholar who has attempted to give a more continental account of the philosophy of biology is [[Hans Jonas]]. His "''The Phenomenon of Life''" (New York, 1966) sets out boldly to offer an "''[[existentialism|existential interpretation]] of biological facts''", starting with the organism's response to stimulus and ending with man confronting the Universe, and drawing upon a detailed reading of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. This is unlikely to have much influence on mainstream philosophy of biology, but indicates, as does Vollmer's work, the current powerful influence of biological thought on philosophy. Another account is given by the late [[Virginia Tech]] philosopher [[Marjorie Grene]].

Philosophy of biology was historically associated very closely with theoretical evolutionary biology, however more recently there have been more diverse movements within philosophy of biology including movements to examine for instance molecular biology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/biology-philosophy/ Philosophy of Biology.]  [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific discovery process==
Research in biology continues to be less guided by theory than it is in other sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=102 Vienna series in theoretical biology]&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case where the availability of [[high throughput screening]] techniques for the different "-[[omics]]" fields such as [[genomics]], whose complexity makes them predominantly data-driven. Such data-intensive scientific discovery is by some considered to be the fourth paradigm, after empiricism, theory and computer simulation.&lt;ref name="fourth_paradigm"&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/fourthparadigm/ Hey, T. (ed) 2009 The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery]&lt;/ref&gt; Others reject the idea that data driven research is about to replace theory.&lt;ref name="no_displacement_theory"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848611000835 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2011.10.007 | pmid=22326074 | volume=43 | issue=1 | title=Scientific perspectivism: A philosopher of science's response to the challenge of big data biology | year=2012 | journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences | pages=69–80 | last1=Callebaut | first1=Werner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dougherty_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dougherty | first1=E.R. | year=2008 | title=On the Epistemological Crisis in Genomics | journal=Current Genomics | volume=9 | issue=2| pages=69–79 | pmc=2674806 | pmid=19440447 | doi=10.2174/138920208784139546}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Krakauer et al. put it: "machine learning is a powerful means of preprocessing data in preparation for mechanistic theory building, but should not be considered the final goal of a scientific inquiry."&lt;ref name=krakauer_2011&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Krakauer | display-authors=1 | last2=et al | year=2011 | title=The challenges and scope of theoretical biology | url=http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~krakauer/Site/Publications_files/YJTBI6363.pdf | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume=276 | issue=1| pages=269–276 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.01.051| pmid= 21315730}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to cancer biology, Raspe et al. state: "A better understanding of tumor biology is fundamental for extracting the relevant information from any high throughput data." &lt;ref name="raspe_2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X12000478 | doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2012.02.011 | pmid=22459768 | volume=22 | issue=3 | title=Gene expression profiling to dissect the complexity of cancer biology: Pitfalls and promise | year=2012 | journal=Seminars in Cancer Biology | pages=250–260 | last1=Raspe | first1=Eric | last2=Decraene | first2=Charles | last3=Berx | first3=Geert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal Science chose cancer immunotherapy as the breakthrough of 2013. According to their explanation a lesson to be learned from the successes of cancer immunotherapy is that they emerged from decoding of basic biology.&lt;ref name="couzin_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Couzin-Frankel | first1=J. | year=2013 | title=Cancer Immunotherapy | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6165/1432.full | journal=Science | volume=342 | issue=6165| pages=1432–1433 | doi=10.1126/science.342.6165.1432| pmid=24357284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theory in biology is to some extent less strictly formalized than in physics. Besides 1) classic mathematical-analytical theory, as in physics, there is 2) statistics-based, 3) computer simulation and 4) conceptual/verbal analysis.&lt;ref name="less_formalized"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/kp233873p70724q0/ Pigliucci, M. (2012) "On the Different Ways of 'Doing Theory' in Biology". Biological Theory. Springer.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Dougherty and Bittner argue that for biology to progress as a science, it has to move to more rigorous mathematical modeling, or otherwise risk to be "empty talk".&lt;ref name="dougherty_2012"&gt;Dougherty, E.R. &amp; Bittner, M.L. (2012) Epistemology of the Cell: A Systems Perspective on Biological Knowledge. Wiley-IEEE Press, p. 149 {{ISBN|978-1-1180-2779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In tumor biology research, the characterization of cellular signaling processes has largely focused on identifying the function of individual genes and proteins. Janes &lt;ref name="Janes_2005"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/310/5754/1646 Janes (2005). "A Systems Model of Signaling Identifies a Molecular Basis Set for Cytokine-Induced Apoptosis". Science.]&lt;/ref&gt; showed however the context-dependent nature of signaling driving cell decisions demonstrating the need for a more system based approach.&lt;ref name="Creixell_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v30/n9/abs/nbt.2345.html | volume=30| issue=9|doi=10.1038/nbt.2345 | pmid=22965061| title=Navigating cancer network attractors for tumor-specific therapy | year=2012 | journal=Nature Biotechnology | pages=842–848 | last1=Creixell | first1=Pau | last2=Schoof | first2=Erwin M. | last3=Erler | first3=Janine T. | last4=Linding | first4=Rune}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of attention for context dependency in preclinical research is also illustrated by the observation that preclinical testing rarely includes predictive biomarkers that, when advanced to clinical trials, will help to distinguish those patients who are likely to benefit from a drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Begley | first1=C. | year=2012 | title=Drug development: Raise standards for preclinical cancer research | doi=10.1038/483531a | pmid=22460880 | journal=Nature | volume= 483| issue=7391| pages= 531–533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Biblical [[eschatology]] a '''Prophetic Year''' or '''Prophetical Year''' is sometimes regarded as being different from an ordinary year&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fbinstitute.com/Anderson/Chapter6.html#6-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/949.104&lt;/ref&gt;, namely
* A 360-day period of "time"
* A 360-year period of "time", or
* A 360-year period of "time" composed of 360-day "years".

The names '''Apocalyptic Year''' and '''Apocalyptical Year''' have also been used in some literature, in obvious reference to Revelation, also known as "The Apocalypse of St. John".

The fact that the prophets understood a year as 360 days is well attested, and can be seen in the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishroots.net/library/prophecy/daniel/daniel-9-24-27/360-day-prophetic-year.html&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in the use of "time, times and half a time" (i.e. 1+2+0.5=3.5), "1,260 days" and "42 months". These references represent a period of 1260 years (based on the 360 day [[Jewish calendar|Jewish year]] multiplied by 3.5).&lt;ref name="SDA1260"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Seventh-day Adventists Believe (2nd ed)
|publisher=Ministerial Association, [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]]
|year=2005
|isbn=1-57847-041-2
|pages=184–185
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Divide 1,260 days by 42 months and you will get a 30-day month, as 12 months of 30 days equals 360-days in a year

These time periods occur eight times in scripture:

*{{bibleverse||Daniel|7:25|NIV}}, "time, times and a half".
*{{bibleverse||Daniel|9:27|NIV}}, "half one set of seven".
*{{bibleverse||Daniel|12:7|NIV}}, "time, times and a half".
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|11:2|NIV}}, "42 months".
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|11:3|NIV}}, "1260 days".
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|12:6|NIV}}, "1260 days".
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|12:14|NIV}}, "time, times and a half".
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|13:5|NIV}}, "42 months".
 


== Origins ==
The origin appears to be in connection mainly with the following [[Bible]] verses referring to the period translated, "[[time]]".

''And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.''  '''Daniel 7:25'''

''And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.''  '''Daniel 12:7'''

''And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. '' '''Revelation 12:14'''

==History==
In ancient times, twelve thirty-day months were used making a total of 360 days for the year. Abraham, used the 360-day year, which was known in Ur.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fbinstitute.com/Anderson/Chapter6.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Genesis account of the flood in the days of Noah illustrated this 360-day year by recording the 150-day interval till the waters abated from the earth.  In other words, it indicates a 5-month period as being exactly 150 days in length, or five 30-day months. 

We see it here in the account of the Flood:

''In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.'' '''Genesis 7:11'''

''And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.'' '''Genesis 7:24'''  

''And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.'' '''Genesis 8:4''' 

The 150 days began on the seventeenth day of the second month, and ended on the seventeenth day of the seventh month. This of course had issues in keeping the seasons correctly in context. The Hebrews added an extra month to compensate.

== Examples in literature ==
Examples of use of the first definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now this seventieth week is admittedly a period of seven years, and half of this period is three times described as "a time, times, and half a time," or "the dividing of times'"* twice as forty-two months;† and twice as 1,260 days.‡  But 1,260 days are exactly equal to forty-two months of thirty days, or three and a half years of 360 days, whereas three and a half [[Julian year (calendar)|Julian year]]s contain 1,278 days.  It follows therefore that the prophetic year is not the [[Julian year (calendar)|Julian year]], but the ancient year of 360 days.§&lt;ref name='anderson'&gt;Anderson, Robert "[https://books.google.com/books?id=mXM_YwLEl3oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Coming Prince]".  Pages 74–75 of the 10th Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(*) Dan. vii. 25; xii. 7; Rev. xii. 14.&lt;br /&gt;
† Rev. xi. 2' xiii. 5.&lt;br /&gt;
‡ Rev. xi. 3' xii. 6.&lt;br /&gt;
§ It is noteworthy that the [[prophecy]] was given at [[Babylon]], and the [[Babylonian year]] consisted of twelve months of thirty days.  That the prophetic year is not the ordinary year is no new discovery.  It was noticed sixteen centuries ago by [[Julias Africanus]] in his ''Chronography'', wherein he explains the seventy weeks to be weeks of ''[[Jewish]]'' (lunar) years, beginning with the twentieth of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]], the fourth year of the 83rd Olympiad, and ending in the second year of the 202nd Olympiad; 475 Julian years being equal to 490 lunar years.&lt;ref name='anderson'/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second and third definition can be said to follow from application of the [[Year-day principle|day for a year principle]].

Examples of the third definition:&lt;ref name='fleming'&gt;Fleming, Robert Jr. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4CUEAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=robert+fleming+papacy&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=3-_pq4mrbF&amp;sig=NL08a9bZ2Jykrge3i1q9FSQhg_Q#PPA93,M1 The Rise and Fall of Papacy] (1801). 1848 edition, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...we will find that the twelve hundred and sixty days in the [[Revelation]], being reduced to years, are eighteen years short of Julian years in the prophetical reckoning, by reason of the additional days turned into years in the ordinary accounts now, above the Apocalyptical reckoning.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To demonstrate which, I present you with the following scheme:---
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Prophetical Year.&lt;br /&gt;
One    360 + One 360 = Two 720&lt;br /&gt;
Three 1080 + Half 180 = Three Years and a half - 1260
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Julian Year.&lt;br /&gt;
One    365 + One 365 = Two 730&lt;br /&gt;
Three 1095 + Half 183 = Three Years and a half - 1278
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now if, according to this computation, we subtract twelve hundred and sixty Apocalyptical years from twelve hundred and seventy-eight Julian or Gregorian ones ( I call them so ''ore rotundo'', overlooking the smaller measures of time), there remain eighteen years to be cut off.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Discussion ==

In scripture, Prophetic Years of 360 days instead of normal years of 365 days has been interpreted as being equal to prophetic months of 30 days or years which has been interpreted as being equal to one "time" to be able to fit the interpretation that Jesus was the messiah as per Daniel 9. To arrive at that theory, they use "times, time, and half a time" mentioned in one verse and subsequently 42 months and [[1260 day prophecy|1260 days]] have been mentioned in other verses as found in Daniel and Revelation, these periods have been taken by many as talking about equal periods of time.

'''Prophetic Months'''
Other interpretations, (reference 4) have taken instead, prophetic months as equal to an average of 30.44 years based on 365.2422 divided by 12.

'''Reiki share''', also known as Reiki circle or exchange, is a gathering of [[Reiki]] believers who participate in group Reiki treatments on each other. The main purpose for the Reiki share is to give and receive Reiki in a casual atmosphere of friendship, honor, positive energy and devotion.&lt;ref

[[File:ReikiShareHands.jpg|thumb|Multiple healers giving Reiki to a recipient at a Reiki share.]]

==Purpose==
Practitioners claim Reiki share offers recipients the combined wisdom and skill from multiple practitioners with different levels of experience.&lt;ref name="What is Reiki Share"/&gt; Time spent on the table(s) is shorter than a private Reiki session, but recipients receive attention from several pairs of hands simultaneously.&lt;ref name="What is Reiki Share"/&gt; Practitioners also claim that they benefit from giving Reiki as well as receiving it.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Rowland|first1=Amy Z.|title=Complete Book of Traditional Reiki - Practical Methods for Personal and Planetary Healing|date=2010|publisher=Healing Arts Press|isbn=978-1-59477--911-4|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zs-El-CxKPEC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=reiki+%22the+practitioner+benefits%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TPeNVeSFH4-2ogTPmIugAg&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=reiki%20%22the%20practitioner%20benefits%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to giving and receiving Reiki, Reiki shares offer participants the opportunity to: 
* Socialize and make new friends in their Reiki community
* Learn about Reiki through [[peer support]]
* Find a Reiki client, practitioner, or trainer&lt;ref name="Dummies p195-220"/&gt;

==Meeting agendas==
Each Reiki event is different, but they usually include one of more of the following activities:&lt;ref name="Dummies p195-220"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rivard"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rivard|first1=Richard|title=Reiki Share / Exchange / Circle Ideas|url=http://www.threshold.ca/reiki/Reiki_Share_Ideas.html|website=The Reiki Threshold|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* self introductions
* talks
* presentations
* prayers (often silent)
* meditation 
* [[singing bowls]] 
* [[reflexology]]
* [[chakra]] healing
* [[chanting]]
* [[smudging]]
* [[aromatherapy]]
* [[gemstones]] 
Others include a variety of different [[rituals]].&lt;ref name="What is Reiki Share"/&gt;

During a Reiki share, the recipients ultimately break into small groups and take turns lying down on massage tables. Multiple practitioners gather around each recipient and place their hands on or over them, rotating to make sure all attendees receive a similar amount of attention.

===Exchanges===
Reiki exchange implies that both people in the exchange are practitioners.&lt;ref name="Dummies p195-220"/&gt;  Exchanges are generally restricted to Reiki practitioners.

===Circles===
Circle implies that at some point, the group sits or stands in a circle, sometimes called healing circles.&lt;ref

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1950">'''René Château''' (27 June 1906 – 5 April 1970) was a French philosopher, poet and politician.

Château was born in [[Mouthiers-sur-Boëme]].  He represented the [[Radical-Socialist Party Camille Pelletan]] in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] from 1936 to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1940 he voted in favour of granting the Cabinet presided by Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] authority to draw up a new constitution, thereby effectively ending the [[French Third Republic]] and establishing [[Vichy France]].

As a journalist, he worked with [[Marcel Déat]] and became editor of ''La France socialiste'', which he used to denounce the three international institutions of "capitalism, bolshevism and Jewishness".&lt;ref&gt;''La France socialiste'', 19–30 August 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he joined the [[National Popular Rally]] (RNP), from which he was expelled in 1943.  In 1944 he was arrested and imprisoned as a Nazi collaborator, first by the "[[francs-tireurs]]" and later by the forces of liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Epstein, ''Un paradoxe français|Un paradoxe français : Antiracistes dans la collaboration, antisémites dans la Résistance'', éd. Albin Michel, 2008, p.211.&lt;/ref&gt;  He later wrote an account of his captivity called ''L'Âge de Caïn'' (1947), published under the pseudonym of Jean-Pierre Abel.

'''Richard Price''' (23 February 1723 – 19 April 1791) was a British [[moral philosopher]], [[nonconformist]] preacher and mathematician. He was also a political [[pamphleteer]], active in radical, republican, and liberal causes such as the [[American Revolution]]. He was well-connected and fostered communication between a large number of people, including several of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].

Price spent most of his adult life as minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]], on the outskirts of London. He also wrote on issues of [[demography]] and [[finance]], and was a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].

==Early life==
[[File:Newington green terrace 1.jpg|thumb|left|52–55 Newington Green, including the houses of Price and Rogers. This is the oldest brick terrace in London.]]
Richard Price was the son of Rhys Price, a [[English Dissenters|dissenting]] minister. His mother was Catherine Richards, his father's second wife. Richard was born at Tyn Ton, a farmhouse in the village of [[Llangeinor]], [[Glamorgan]], [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-22225104|title=Dr Richard Price: The Welshman who influenced US founders|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garwheritage.co.uk/wordpress/?p=641|title=Richard Price of Llangeinor|publisher=Gerald Jarvis, Garw Valley Heritage Society, 16 March 2011|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated privately, then at [[Neath]] and [[Pentwyn, Cardiff|Pen-twyn]]. He studied under Vavasor Griffiths at Chancefield, [[Talgarth]].&lt;ref name="ODNB 22761"&gt;{{cite ODNB |title= Price, Richard (1723–1791) |year=2004 |id=22761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then [[Cultural relationship between the Welsh and the English|left Wales for England]], where he spent the rest of his life. He studied with [[John Eames]] and the [[dissenting academy]] in [[Moorfields]], [[London]].&lt;ref name="ODNB 22761"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Price, Richard (1723-1791)|display=Price, Richard (1723–1791)|volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the academy in 1744, Price became [[chaplain]] and companion to George Streatfield at [[Stoke Newington]], then a village just north of London. He also held the lectureship at [[Old Jewry Meeting-house|Old Jewry]], where [[Samuel Chandler]] was minister.&lt;ref name="ODNB 22761"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thornbury |first=Walter |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45055 |title=Old Jewry |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1878 |work=Old and New London: Volume 1 |accessdate=16 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Streatfield's death and that of an uncle in 1757 improved his circumstances, and on 16 June 1757 he married Sarah Blundell, originally of [[Belgrave, Leicester|Belgrave]] in [[Leicestershire]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|1911|p=314}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newington Green congregation==
In 1758 Price moved to [[Newington Green]], and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace even then a hundred years old. (The building still survives as London's oldest brick terrace, dated 1658.) Price became minister to the [[Newington Green Unitarian Church|Newington Green meeting-house]], a church that continues today as Newington Green Unitarian Church. Among the congregation were [[Samuel Vaughan]] and his family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead/Mss.B.V462-ead.xml amphilsoc.org, ''John Vaughan papers, 1768 – Circa 1936''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Price had [[Thomas Amory (tutor)|Thomas Amory]] as preaching colleague from 1770.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Amory, Thomas (1701-1774)|display=Amory, Thomas (1701–1774)|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When, in 1770, Price became morning preacher at the [[Gravel Pit Chapel]] in [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], he continued his afternoon sermons at Newington Green. He also accepted duties at the meeting house in Old Jewry.

==Friends and associates==
===Newington Green neighbours===
A close friend of Price was Thomas Rogers, father of [[Samuel Rogers]], a merchant turned banker who had married into a long-established Dissenting family and lived at No. 56 the Green. More than once, Price and the elder Rogers rode on horseback to Wales.&lt;ref name="Thorncroft, p. 15"/&gt; Another was the Rev. [[James Burgh]], author of ''The Dignity of Human Nature'' and ''Thoughts on Education'', who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to Price's sermons.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Price, Rogers, and Burgh formed a dining club, eating at each other's houses in rotation.&lt;ref&gt;Allardyce, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Price and Rogers joined the [[Society for Constitutional Information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Dissent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ydw8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=16 June 2013|publisher=CUP Archive|pages=41–42|id=GGKEY:UGD38TZ8G4J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bowood circle===
The "Bowood circle" was a group of liberal intellectuals around [[Lord Shelburne]], and named after [[Bowood House]], his seat in [[Wiltshire]]. Price met Shelburne in or shortly after 1767,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fruchtman |first=Jack |title=The Apocalyptic Politics of Richard Price and Joseph Priestley: A Study in Late Eighteenth Century English Republican Millennialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MD4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=16 June 2013|date=1 January 1983|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-734-9|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or was introduced by his wife [[Elizabeth Montagu]], a leader of the [[Blue Stockings Society|Blue Stocking]] intellectual women, after the publication of his ''Four Dissertations'' in that year.&lt;ref name="Holland48"&gt;Holland, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1771 Price had Shelburne employ [[Thomas Jervis (minister)|Thomas Jervis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Jervis, Thomas|display=Jervis, Thomas|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of the circle was [[Benjamin Vaughan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=98253|title=Clavière, Étienne|first=Richard|last=Whatmore}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772 Price recruited [[Joseph Priestley]], who came to work for Shelburne as librarian from 1773.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers and Wykes, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blakemore |first=Steven |title=Intertextual War: Edmund Burke and the French revolution in the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, Thomas Paine, and James Mackintosh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEbY1xeU4S4C&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=16 June 2013|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3751-7|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Seed |title=Gentlemen Dissenters: The Social and Political Meanings of Rational Dissent in the 1770s and 1780s |journal=Historical Journal |volume=28 |year=1985 |pages=299–325 (320) |jstor=2639100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Club of Honest Whigs"===
The group that [[Benjamin Franklin]] christened the "Club of Honest Whigs" was an informal dining group around [[John Canton]]. It met originally in [[St Paul's Churchyard]], at the [[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|London Coffee House]]; in 1771 it moved to [[Ludgate Hill]]. Price and [[John Pringle (physician)|Sir John Pringle]] were members, as were Priestley and Benjamin Vaughan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Paul |title=Science and Dissent in England, 1688–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPWTn9DNBMEC&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=16 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3718-9|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visitors===
At home, or at his church itself, Price was visited by Franklin, [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Thomas Paine]];&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; other American politicians such as Ambassador [[John Adams]], who later became the second [[president of the United States]], and his wife [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]]; and British politicians such as [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|Lord Lyttleton]], [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Earl Stanhope]] (known as "Citizen Stanhope"), and [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]]. He knew also the philosophers [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]]. Among activists, the prison reformer [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] counted Price as a close friend;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Throness |first=Laurie |title=A Protestant Purgatory: Theological Origins of the Penitentiary Act, 1779|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jI-Iqtv-kU8C&amp;pg=PA131|accessdate=18 June 2013|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6392-8|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt; also there were [[John Horne Tooke]], and [[John Jebb (1736–1786)|John]] and [[Ann Jebb]].&lt;ref name="Thorncroft, p. 15"&gt;Thorncroft, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theologians===
[[File:Repeal of the Test Act Sayers.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Priestley, Richard Price and Theophilus Lindsay in the pulpit, in a 1790 engraving satirising the campaign to have the [[Test Act]] repealed]]
Others acknowledged their debt to Price, such as the Unitarian theologians [[William Ellery Channing]] and [[Theophilus Lindsey]]. When Lindsey resigned his living and moved to London to create an avowedly Unitarian congregation Price played a role in finding and securing the premises for what became [[Essex Street Chapel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitarian.org.uk/support/doc-EssexHall2.shtml chapter 2 ''The History of Essex Hall'' by Mortimer Rowe B.A., D.D. Lindsey Press, 1959.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307014023/http://www.unitarian.org.uk/support/doc-EssexHall2.shtml |date=7 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1770s Price and Lindsey were concerned about the contraction of dissent, at least in the London area.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers and Wykes, p. 159 and p. 160 note 41.&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Andrew Kippis]] and others, they established the [[Society for Promoting Knowledge of the Scriptures]] in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Page |first=Anthony |title=John Jebb and the Enlightenment Origins of British Radicalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-oGRl4KxJMC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=17 June 2013|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97775-7|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price and Priestley took diverging views on morals and [[metaphysics]]. In 1778 appeared a published correspondence, ''A Free Discussion on the Doctrines of Materialism and Philosophical Necessity''. Price maintained, in opposition to Priestley, the free agency of man and the unity and immateriality of the human soul. Price's opinions were [[Arianism|Arian]], Priestley's were [[socinianism|Socinian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Botting |first=Eileen Hunt |title=Family Feuds: Wollstonecraft, Burke, and Rousseau on the Transformation of the Family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIirNHqjUqwC&amp;pg=PA158|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=May 2007|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-6706-0|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mary Wollstonecraft===
[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797).jpg|right|thumb|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (c. 1797)]]
[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] moved her fledgling school for girls from [[Islington]] to Newington Green in 1784,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; with patron Mrs Burgh, widow of Price's friend James Burgh.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft, originally an [[Anglican]], attended Price's services, where believers of all kinds were welcomed.&lt;ref name="Tomalin, p. 60"&gt;Tomalin, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rational Dissenters]] appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women,&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; and proved kinder to her than her own family.&lt;ref name="Tomalin, p. 60"/&gt; Price is believed to have helped her with money to go to [[Lisbon]] to see her close friend Fanny Blood.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft was then unpublished: through Price she met the radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]]. The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at Newington Green pushed her towards a political awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 51 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; She later published ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' (1790), a response to [[Edmund Burke|Burke]]'s denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price; and ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), extending Price's arguments about equality to women: [[Claire Tomalin|Tomalin]] argues that just as the Dissenters were "excluded as a class from education and civil rights by a lazy-minded majority", so too were women, and the "character defects of both groups" could be attributed to this discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Price appears 14 times in the diary of [[William Godwin]], Wollstonecraft's later husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://godwindiary.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/people/PRI02.html|title=Person record for Price,    Richard|author=|date=|website=godwindiary.bodleian.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The American Revolution ==
The support Price gave to the colonies of [[British North America]] in the [[American War of Independence]] made him famous. In early 1776 he published ''Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty, the Principles of Government, and the Justice and Policy of the War with America''.

Price's name became identified with the cause of American independence. [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]] was a close friend; Price corresponded with [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]]; and in the winter of 1778 he was invited by the [[Continental Congress]] to go to America and assist in the financial administration of the states, an offer he turned down. In 1781 he, solely with [[George Washington]], received the degree of [[Doctor of Laws]] from [[Yale University|Yale College]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He preached to crowded congregations, and, when Lord Shelburne became Prime Minister in 1782, he was offered the post of his private secretary.

Price wrote also ''Observations on the importance of the [[American Revolution]] and the means of rendering it a benefit to the World'' (1784). Well received by Americans, it suggested that the greatest problem facing Congress was its lack of central powers.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Revolution controversy==
[[File:Smelling out a rat.jpg|thumb|left|''Smelling out a Rat'', a caricature of Price with [[Edmund Burke]]'s vision looking over his shoulder, by [[James Gillray]], 1790.]]
Both Price and Priestley, who were [[millennialists]], saw the [[French Revolution]]  of 1789 as fulfilment of prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Landes |first=Richard |title=Heaven on Earth:The Varieties of the Millennial Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ly08wDNPVcC&amp;pg=PA250|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=7 July 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-983181-4|pages=250–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 101st anniversary of the [[Glorious Revolution]], 4 November 1789, Price preached a [[sermon]] entitled ''[[A Discourse on the Love of Our Country]]'', and ignited the pamphlet war known as the [[Revolution Controversy]], on the political issues raised by the French Revolution. Price drew a bold parallel between the Glorious Revolution of 1688 (the one celebrated by the London Revolution Society dinner) and the French Revolution of 1789, arguing that the former had spread enlightened ideas and paved the way for the second one. Price exhorted the public to divest themselves of national prejudices and embrace "universal benevolence", a concept of cosmopolitanism that entailed support for the French Revolution and the progress of "enlightened" ideas.&lt;ref&gt;On Price's ''Discourse on the Love of Our Country'', see: Rémy Duthille, [http://www.english.qmul.ac.uk/drwilliams/journal/issues/28%282012%29.pdf#page=33 “Richard Price on Patriotism and Universal Benevolence”, ''Enlightenment and Dissent'', 28 (2012), pp. 24–41.]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called "one of the great political debates in British history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crowe |first=Ian |title=An Imaginative Whig: Reassessing the Life and Thought of Edmund Burke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3-oIBwZvFcC&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=17 June 2013|year=2005|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-6419-0|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the dinner of the London Revolution Society that followed, Price also suggested that the Society should send an address to the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the start of a correspondence with many Jacobin clubs in Paris and elsewhere in France. Though the London Revolution Society and the Jacobin clubs agreed on basic tenets, their correspondence displayed a sense of growing misunderstanding as the French Jacobins grew more radical and their British correspondents, including Price, were not prepared to condone political violence.&lt;ref&gt;On the French reception of Price's ''Discourse'' and the Revolution Society, see {{cite book |first=Rémy |last=Duthille |chapter=1688–1789.

Burke's rebuttal in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790) attacked Price, whose friends Paine and Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor; [[William Coxe (historian)|William Coxe]] was another opponent, disagreeing with Price on interpretation of "our country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=J.

==Later life==
[[File:Newington Green Unitarian Church (interior) 09.JPG|thumb|Memorial to Price in Newington Green Unitarian Church]]
[[File:Richard Price monument.JPG|thumb|Tomb of Price and his wife Sarah in [[Bunhill Fields]] burial ground]]
In 1767 Price received the honorary degree of [[D.D.]] from the [[University of Aberdeen]], and in 1769 another from the [[University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref name="ODNB 22761"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In 1786 Sarah Price died: there were no children by the marriage.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the same year Price with other Dissenters founded [[Hackney New College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor-last=Baker |editor-first=T.F.T. |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22714 |title=Hackney: Protestant Nonconformity |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1995 |work=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 10: Hackney |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 1791 Price died.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; His funeral was conducted at [[Bunhill Fields]] and his funeral sermon was preached by Joseph Priestley.

His extended family included [[William Morgan (actuary)|William Morgan]], the actuary, and his brother [[George Cadogan Morgan]] (1754–1798), dissenting minister and scientist, both sons of Richard Price's sister Sarah by William Morgan, a surgeon of [[Bridgend]], [[Glamorganshire]].

==Publications==
In 1744 Price published a volume of sermons.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; It was, however, as a writer on financial and political questions that Price became widely known. Price rejected traditional [[Christian]] notions of [[original sin]] and moral punishment, preaching the perfectibility of human nature,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote on theological questions. He also wrote on [[finance]], [[economics]], [[probability]], and [[life insurance]].

===Thomas Bayes===
Price was asked to become [[literary executor]] of [[Thomas Bayes]] the mathematician.&lt;ref name="Holland46"&gt;Holland, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; He edited Bayes's major work ''[[An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances]]'' (1763), which appeared in ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'', and contains [[Bayes' Theorem]], one of the fundamental results of [[probability theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Richard |title=David Hartley on Human Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCu6HhGlAB8C&amp;pg=PA243|accessdate=16 June 2013|year=1999|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-9451-6|pages=243–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price wrote an introduction to the paper which provides some of the philosophical basis of [[Bayesian statistics]]. In 1765 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his work on the legacy of Bayes.&lt;ref name="Holland46"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Price |first=Richard |title=Price: Political Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdH-gjy2vzUC&amp;pg=PR23|accessdate=16 June 2013|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-40969-8|page=xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographer===
[[File:Price - Observations on reversionary payments, 1772 - 328.tif|thumb|''Observations on reversionary payments'', 1772.]]
From about 1766 Price worked with the [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society|Society for Equitable Assurances]].&lt;ref name="ODNB 22761"/&gt; In 1769, in a letter to [[Benjamin Franklin]], he made some observations on [[life expectancy]], and the population of London, which were published in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' of that year.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Price's views included the detrimental effects of large cities, and the need for some constraints on commerce and movement of population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Claeys |first=Gregory |title=Citizens and Saints: Politics and Anti-Politics in Early British Socialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-nWgJFb-CgC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=17 June 2013|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-36490-4|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular Price took an interest in the figures of Franklin and [[Ezra Stiles]] on the colonial population in America, thought in some places to be doubling every 22 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lemay |first=Joseph A. Leo |title=The Life of Benjamin Franklin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NL5bcRP5aRAC&amp;pg=PA606|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=1 October 2008|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4121-1|page=606}}&lt;/ref&gt; A debate on the British population had begun in the 1750s ([[William Brakenridge]], Richard Forster, [[Robert Wallace (minister)|Robert Wallace]] who pointed to manufacturing and [[smallpox]] as factors reducing population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rusnock |first=Andrea A. |title=Vital Accounts: Quantifying Health and Population in Eighteenth-Century England and France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHQ8j0gqLuwC&amp;pg=PA181|accessdate=18 June 2013|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-10123-3|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Bell (benefactor)|William Bell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=2033|title=Bell, William|first=B.

It was disputed numerically by [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]] in his ''Political Arithmetic'' (1774), which took in also criticism of the [[physiocrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rusnock |first=Andrea A. |title=Vital Accounts: Quantifying Health and Population in Eighteenth-Century England and France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHQ8j0gqLuwC&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-10123-3|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Koen Stapelbroek|author2=Jani Marjanen|title=The Rise of Economic Societies in the Eighteenth Century: Patriotic Reform in Europe and North America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6R_lIA_AWYC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=30 August 2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-26525-8|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1770 Price presented to the Royal Society a paper on the proper method of calculating the values of contingent reversions. His book ''Observations on Reversionary Payments'' (1771) became a classic, in use for about a century, and providing the basis for financial calculations of insurance and benefit societies, of which many had recently been formed.&lt;ref name="Holland46"/&gt; The "Northampton table", a [[life table]] compiled by Price with data from [[Northampton]], became standard for about a century in actuarial work. It, too, overestimated mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hacking |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Hacking |title=The Taming of Chance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7EzIBwQBwC&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=31 August 1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-38884-9|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, it was good for the insurance business, and adverse for those funding annuities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zelizer |first=Viviana A.

Price wrote a further ''Essay on the Population of England'' (2nd ed., 1780) which influenced [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]. His continuing claim in it on British depopulation was challenged by [[John Howlett (political economist)|John Howlett]] in 1781.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=14002|title=Howlett, John|first=R. D.|last=Sheldon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation of actual causes of ill-health began at this period, in a group of radical physicians around Priestley, including Price but centred on the Midlands and north-west: with [[John Aikin]], [[Matthew Dobson (physician)|Matthew Dobson]], [[John Haygarth]] and [[Thomas Percival]].&lt;ref name="Lucas1980"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=Bryan Keith |title=The Unreformed Local Government System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9MNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=18 June 2013|year=1980|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-85664-877-9|pages=116–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these Haygarth and Percival supplied Price with figures, to supplement those he had collected himself in Northampton parishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rusnock |first=Andrea A. |title=Vital Accounts: Quantifying Health and Population in Eighteenth-Century England and France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHQ8j0gqLuwC&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=18 June 2013|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-10123-3|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public finance===
In 1771 Price published his ''Appeal to the Public on the Subject of the National Debt'' (ed. 1772 and 1774). This pamphlet excited considerable controversy, and is supposed to have influenced [[William Pitt the Younger]] in re-establishing the [[sinking fund]] for the extinction of the [[national debt]], created by [[Robert Walpole]] in 1716 and abolished in 1733. The means proposed for the extinction of the debt are described by [[Lord Overstone]] as "a sort of hocus-pocus machinery," supposed to work "without loss to any one," and consequently unsound.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Price's views were attacked by [[John Brand (political writer)|John Brand]] in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Brand, John (d.1808)|display=Brand, John (d.1808)|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Brand returned to finance and fiscal matters, ''Alteration of the Constitution of the House of Commons and the Inequality of the Land Tax'' (1793), he used work of Price, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=3255|title=Brand, John|first=R. D.|last=Sheldon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral philosophy===
The ''Review of the Principal Questions in Morals'' (1758, 3rd ed. revised 1787) contains Price's theory of [[ethics]]. The work is supposedly a refutation of [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Price represented a different tradition, [[deontological ethics]] rather than the [[virtue ethics]] of Hutcheson, going back to [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[John Balguy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Terence Cuneo |editor2=René van Woudenberg |title=The Cambridge Companion to Thomas Reid |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-01208-2 |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided into ten chapters, the first of which gives his main ethical theory, allied to that of [[Ralph Cudworth]]. Other chapters show his relation to [[Joseph Butler]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Philosophically and politically Price had something in common with [[Thomas Reid]].&lt;ref name="Haakonssen2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haakonssen |first=Knud |title=Enlightenment and Religion: Rational Dissent in Eighteenth-Century Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOY56Aqh77YC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=2 November 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02987-2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a moralist Price is now regarded as a precursor to the [[rational intuitionism]] of the 20th century. He drew, among other sources, on [[Cicero]] and [[Panaetius]], and has been labelled a "British Platonist".&lt;ref&gt;Martha K. Zebrowski, ''Richard Price: British Platonist of the Eighteenth Century'', Journal of the History of Ideas
Vol. 55, No. 1 (Jan. 1994), pp. 17–35, at pp. 18–19. Published by: University of Pennsylvania Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709951&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. G. A. Pocock]] comments that Price was a moralist first, putting morality well ahead of democratic attachments. He was widely criticised for that and an absence of interest in [[civil society]]. As well as Burke, [[John Adams]], [[Adam Ferguson]] and [[Josiah Tucker]] wrote against him.&lt;ref name="PocockSchochet1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. G. A. Pocock|author2=Gordon J. Schochet|author3=[[Lois G.

For Price, right and wrong belong to actions in themselves, and he rejects [[consequentialism]]. This ethical value is perceived by [[reason]] or understanding, which intuitively recognizes fitness or congruity between actions, agents and total circumstances. Arguing that ethical judgment is an act of discrimination, he endeavours to invalidate [[moral sense theory]]. He admits that right actions must be "grateful" to us; that, in fact, moral approbation includes both an act of the understanding and an emotion of the heart. Still it remains true that reason alone, in its highest development, would be a sufficient guide. In this conclusion he is in close agreement with Kant; reason is the arbiter, and right is

# not a matter of the emotions and
# no relative to imperfect human nature.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Price's main point of difference with Cudworth is that while Cudworth regards the moral criterion as a νόημα or modification of the mind, existing in germ and developed by circumstances, Price regards it as acquired from the contemplation of actions, but acquired necessarily, immediately intuitively. In his view of disinterested action (ch. iii.) he follows Butler. Happiness he regards as the only end, conceivable by us, of [[divine Providence]], but it is a happiness wholly dependent on rectitude. Virtue tends always to happiness, and in the end must produce it in its perfect form.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Other works===
Price also wrote ''Fast-day Sermons'', published respectively in 1779 and 1781. Throughout the American War, Price preached sermons on fast-days and took the opportunity to attack Britain's coercive policies toward the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-s-p.org/flyers/978-1-4438-0546-9-sample.pdf Rémy Duthille, “Dissent against the American War : The Politics of Richard Price’s Sermons”, in ''War Sermons'', Gilles Teulié and Laurence Lux-Sterritt, Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009, pp. 149–72.]&lt;/ref&gt; A complete list of his works was given as an appendix to Priestley's ''Funeral Sermon''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Seddiqin Argument''' ({{lang-fa|برهان صدیقین}}) or the '''argument of the righteous''' is an argument for the [[existence of God]] in [[Islamic philosophy]]. This argument was explained by [[Islamic philosopher]]s such as [[Avicenna]], [[Mulla Sadra]] and [[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mullasadra.org/new_site/english/Paper%20Bank/Knowledge%20of%20GOD/Ayatullahi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==The name of Seddiqin==
Seddiqin means the argument of the sincere men or truthful ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ayatollahi|2005|p.94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seddiqin refers to Those who are just only argue for the God's existence through God. In other words, in this argument, the existence of God argued through only the existence. According to Legenhausen the Seddiqin is synonym with sincere, sincere is antonym with 
hypocritical.The word "Seddiqin" is a ''sighah mubalighah'' in Arabic grammar which shows extra attribution.Consequently, Seddiqin means those who are extremist in faith and belief.&lt;ref&gt;The Proof of the Sincere,Hajj Muhammad Legenhausen,p.2,2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical views==
The Seddiqin counted as one of the lasting and permanent argument in  [[Islamic philosophy]] for the existence of God.This argument also posed by most of Islamic philosophers in different explanation to justify the [[Necessity Being]].It seems that one who first presented the argument is [[Avicenna]]. after him, many of Islamic philosophers try to show other explanation of the Seddiqin argument.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/46372/1/12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avicenna's Argument===
{{main|Proof of the Truthful}}
[[Avicenna]] detailed the argument for the existence of God in three books namely Al-Shifa[[The Book of Healing]] and Al-Nejat and [[Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ayatollahi|2005|p.96}}&lt;/ref&gt; it seems that for the first time applied the argument of Seddiqin. According to Muhammad Legenhausen little pay attention to Avicenna's proof of sincere.&lt;ref&gt;The Proof of the Sincere, Muhammad Legenhausen,vol:1.issue number 1,The Journal of Islamic Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;[[Avicenna]] described the argument as seddiqin( Borhane seddiqin) because this argumentation applies by those who are truthful. According to [[Avicenna]], those who are truthful persons, their argument is pure truth while there is no symbols of untruthfulness in their argumentation. In other words, Seddiqin witness to existence of God and truth just only by one argument which is the essence of Truth and God. [[Avicenna]] refers to the argument as follows:

{{quote |text=Consider how our statements in proving the First-almighty and His unity and his acquittance from all deficiencies did not anything other than existence itself; and there is no need to consider his creatures and acts. Also they are, also, some reasons for His existence, but this kind of demonstration is a stronger one and a higher position. This means when we survey the mode of existence we consider that existence in so far as it is existence, witness to the existence of God, then it witness to other beings.|author=Avicenna|source= Ayatollahi Hamidreza, the existence of God}}
Also [[Avicenna]] quotes the Quran to support the argumentation:" Is it not sufficient as regards your Lord that he is witness over all things"(surah 41, verse 53).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ayatollahi| 2005|p.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna focuses on the view that God is a necessary being in itself.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=c2G8J_N6W8AC&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=Avicenna%E2%80%99s+Proof+of+the+Existence+of+God+as+a+Necessarily+Existent+Being&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAWoVChMIhI3yzMXJxwIVBZtyCh1RKAW_#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is based on contingency. The claim of Avicenna is that we can establish the existence of God directly by consideration of his existence itself. In other words in the proof of sincere, Avicenna tries to reach the existence of God just through an analysis of existence itself along with the supposition that God is the necessary existent. According to him, if we reflect on any things generally and consider only to its existence, then the existence is either necessary or not. If the existence is necessary then it is God-Avicenna call it (al-Wajib al-wujud)  and if the existent is not necessary then it is impossible or contingent. It is not impossible because we assume that it is something therefore it must be contingent. In fact, if we consider the existence of existent alone then it is either the necessary or contingent. The contingent, in respect to its existence, needed ab alio or something which brings it into existence. The preponderant itself is necessary or contingent. If it is necessary, then it is God. If it is contingent, then it is in need of a transcendent cause. The series of these transcendent causes themselves are finite or infinite. The finite series finally arrives to God since that the last member doesn't need to any cause and therefore itself is by definition the Necessary Existent. If the series would be infinite then series as a whole needed to its components in its existence and therefore is contingent.&lt;ref&gt;The Proof of the Sincere, Muhammad Legenhausen,vol:1.issue number 1,p.2-3The Journal of Islamic Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shihab al-Din Yahya Suhrawardi’s Argumant===
Suhrawardi, founder of illuminatinism, also referred to the seddiqin. its version is important for two reasons. first that he introduce mystical ideas into the argument. secondly mulla Sadra Shirazi known himself closer to Suhrawardi rather than Avicenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hajj Muhammad Legenhausen|2004|p.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suhrawardi has its terminology for the argument. For instance he used word the lights of light in place of God or necessary being. He used rich for necessary being and poor for contingent being. His argument in his collected works are as follows:

{{quote |text=If immaterial light were poor in its essence, then its need would not be for a dusky dead substance, for it would not be proper that the more noble and complete should be founded on that which is not in that direction [toward nobility], and how could the dusky benefit the light? So, if the immaterial light is needy in its occurrence, then there should be for it a supporting light. Then the ordered supporting lights will not go on to an infinite regress, as you know from the proof for the necessity of an end for things ordered into collections. So, there must be an end to the supporting lights, and their accidents and barzakh [mediation] and shapes are [directed] to a light beyond which is no further light, and that is the Light of Lights, the Comprehensive Light, the Self-Subsistent Light, the Sacred Light, the most Magnificent and Lofty of Lights, and this is the Almighty Light, and this is the absolutely needless, for no other thing is beyond it|author=Shihab al-Din Yahya Suhrawardi, " Majmu’ah musannifat shaykh ishraq " (1957-1960) |source= Henty Corbin,the collected works of Sheykh Eshraq.1977, Vol. 2, p. 121}}

Of course the above argument depends upon the impossibility of an infinite regress but in other books he presents as argument in which there is no need to the supposition of infinite regress. This argument is as follows:
{{quote |text=And also by another route: A thing does not require its own nonexistence, otherwise it would not occur. The Light of Lights is a unity; in itself it has no conditions. All else is subject to it. Since it has no condition and no opposite, there is nothing which can void it, so it is self-sufficient and everlasting. And the Light of Lights is not attached to any sort of shape, whether luminous or dark, and attributes are not possible for it in any aspect|author=Shihab al-Din Yahya Suhrawardi, " Majmu’ah musannifat shaykh ishraq " (1957-1960) |source= Henty Corbin,the collected works of Sheykh Eshraq.1977, Vol. 2, 122-123}}

This argument has closed relation with metaphor of light. According to surawardi, if we suppose that existence is contingent then if the regress of infinite be impossible, consequently there is to be a first.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hajj Muhammad Legenhausen|2004|p.p.7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mulla Sadra' Argument===
Mulla Sadra explained the proof of sincere in a way that his explanation has some differentiation not only with Avicenna's version but also with Suhrevardi's .This differentiation with Avicenna differs in the argument of the existence as an existent. In other words, he begins his argument with an existent in the world until he reached to the necessary existent. Mulla Sadra also rejects Suhrawardi’s statement of the argument from contingency.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Legenhausen|2004|p.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text= And it is stated that existence, as was mentioned before, is a single, simple, objective reality (haqiqah ‘ayniyah). There is no difference in the essences (dhat) of its individuals, but only in perfection and imperfection and in intensity and weakness, or in other matters [not related to existence itself], for example, that between the whatnesses (mahiyyah) of the same species. The ultimate perfection for which there is nothing greater is that which does not depend on anything else, and nothing greater than it can be imagined, for all imperfect things are dependent on others, and are in need of the more complete. It has become clear that the complete is prior to the imperfect, and activity is prior to potentiality. Existence is prior to nothingness. It has also been made clear that the completion of a thing is that very thing with an addition. Therefore, existence is either independent of others or essentially (li dhat) in need of others.

The First is the Necessary Existent, which is Pure Existence than which nothing is more complete, and It is unmixed with non-existence and imperfection. The second is other than this, but is Its actions and effects, which rest upon nothing but It. And, as was mentioned, the reality (haqiqah) of existence has no deficiency, and if any imperfection occurs in it, it is only due to its being an effect, and this is because the effect cannot be of an equal degree to the existence of its cause. So, if existence were not something made (maj‘ul), dominated by that which brings it into existence and brings it about (as according to what it requires), it would not be imaginable that it should have any sort of imperfections. For the reality of existence, as you know, is simple. It is unlimited, not determinate, except for pure activity and occurrence, otherwise there would be mixture in it or it would have some essence other than existence in it.
We have also mentioned that if existence is an effect, then it is in itself something which is made by a making which is simple, and its essence (dhat) in itself is in need (muftaqra) of a maker (ja‘il), and it relies in its substance and essence (dhat) on its maker. Thus, it has been proven and made clear that existence is either complete reality (haqiqah) necessary in its ipseity (huwiyah), or it is essentially (dhatan) in need of it [i.e. that which is necessary in itself], substantially (jawhariyah) relying on it. According to each of these alternatives it has been proven and demonstrated that the existence of the Necessary Existent is in its ipseity needless of any other. This is what we intended. And know that this argument is extremely firm and strong, and its source is near to the way of the Illuminationists, which is based on the principle of light. |author= Sadr al-Din Muhammad Shirazi, " al-Hikmat al-muta’allihiyah fi al-asfar al-’arbah " (Qom: Mustafavi, 1386/1966) |source= Legenhausen, 2004, p. 10}}

{{refimprove|date=October 2011}}
The '''semantic gap''' characterizes the difference between two descriptions of an object by different linguistic representations, for instance languages or symbols. According to Hein, the semantic gap can be defined as "the difference in meaning between constructs formed within different representation systems".&lt;ref name="Hein"&gt;Hein, A.M., Identification and Bridging of Semantic Gaps in the Context of Multi-Domain Engineering, Abstracts of the 2010 Forum on Philosophy, Engineering &amp; Technology. Colorado. [http://philengtech.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/fPET2010-abstracts-5-1-2010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[computer science]], the concept is relevant whenever ordinary human activities, observations, and tasks are transferred into a computational representation.&lt;ref name="IRdef"&gt;Smeulders AWM, Worring M, Santini S, Gupta A, Jain R. Content-Based Image Retrieval at the End of the Early Years. IEEE Trans  Pattern Anal Mach Intell 2000;22(12):1349-80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Multimediadef"&gt;Dorai C, Venkatesh S. Bridging the Semantic Gap with Computational Media Aesthetics. IEEE MultiMedia 2003;10(2):15-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hein"/&gt;

More precisely the gap means the difference between ambiguous formulation of contextual knowledge in a powerful language (e.g. [[natural language]]) and its sound, reproducible and computational representation in a [[formal language]] (e.g. [[programming language]]). [[Semantics]] of an object depends on the context it is regarded within. For practical application this means any formal representation of real world tasks requires the translation of the contextual expert knowledge of an application (high-level) into the elementary and reproducible operations of a computing machine (low-level). Since natural language allows the expression of tasks which are impossible to compute in a formal language there are no means to automatize this translation in a general way. Moreover, the examination of languages within the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] indicates that there is no formal and consequently automated way of translating from one language into another above a certain level of expressional power.

==Theoretical background==
The yet unproven but commonly accepted [[Church-Turing thesis]] states that a [[Turing machine]] and all equivalent formal languages such as the [[lambda calculus]] perform and represent all formal operations respectively as applied by a computing human. However the selection of adequate operations for the correct computation itself is not formally deducible, moreover it depends on the computability of the underlying problem. Tasks, such as the [[halting problem]], may be formulated comprehensively in natural language, but the computational representation will not terminate or does not provide a usable result, which is proven by [[Rice's theorem]]. The general expression of limitations for rule based deduction by Gödel's [[incompleteness theorem]] indicates that the semantic gap is never to be fully closed. These are general statements, considering the generalized limits of computation on the highest level of abstraction where the '''semantic gap''' manifests itself. There are however lots of subsets of problems which may be translated automatically, especially in the higher numbered levels of the Chomsky hierarchy.

==Formal languages==
Real world tasks are formalized by programming languages, which are executed on computers based on the [[von Neumann architecture]]. Since programming languages are only comfortable representations of the Turing machine any program on a von Neumann computer has the same properties and limitations as the Turing machine or its equivalent representation. Consequently, every programming language such as CPU level machine code, assembler, or any high level programming language has the same expressional power as the underlying Turing machine is able to compute. There is no '''semantic gap''' between them since a program is transferred from the high level language to the machine code by a program, e.g. a [[compiler]] which itself runs on a Turing machine without any user interaction. The semantic gap actually opens between the selection of the rules and the representation of the task.

==Practical consequences==
Selection of rules for formal representations of real world applications, corresponds to writing a program. Writing programs is independent from the actual programming language and basically requires the translation of the domain specific knowledge of the user into the formal rules operating a turing machine. It is this transfer from contextual knowledge into formal representation which cannot be automatized with respect to the theoretical limitations of computation. Consequently, any mapping from real world applications into computer applications requires a certain amount of technical background knowledge by the user, where the '''semantic gap''' manifests itself.

It is a fundamental task of [[software engineering]] to close the gap between application specific knowledge and technically doable formalization. For this purpose domain specific (high-level) knowledge must be transferred into an algorithm and its parameters (low-level). This requires the dialogue between user and developer. Aim is always a software which allows the user to represent his knowledge as parameters of an algorithm without knowing the details of the implementation, and to interpret the outcome of the algorithm without the aid of the developer. For this purpose [[user interface]]s play the key role in software design, while developers are supported by [[Software framework|frameworks]] which help organizing the integration of contextual information.

==Examples==

===Document retrieval===
A simple example can be formulated as a series of increasingly difficult [[Natural language processing|natural language]] queries to locate a ''target document'' that may or may not exist locally on a known computer system.

'''Example queries''':
* 1) Locate any file in the known directory "/usr/local/funny".
* 2) Locate any file where the word "funny" appears in the filename.
* 3) Locate any [[text file]] where the word "funny" or the substring "humor" appears in the text.
* 4) Locate any [[mp3]] file where either "funny", "comic" or "humor" appears in the metadata.
* 5) Locate any file of any type related to humor.
* 6) Locate any image that is likely to make my grandmother laugh.

The progressive difficulty of these queries is represented by the increasing degree of abstraction from the types and semantics defined the system architecture (directories and files on a known computer) to the types and semantics that occupy the realm of ordinary human discourse (subjects such as "humor" and entities such as "my grandmother"). Moreover, this disparity of realms is further complicated by [[leaky abstraction]]s, such as is common in the case of query 4), where the ''target document'' may exist, but may not encapsulate the "metadata" in a manner expected by the user, nor the designer of the query processing system.

===Image analysis===
Image analysis is a typical domain for which a high degree of abstraction from low-level methods is required, and where the '''semantic gap''' immediately affects the user. If image content is to be identified to understand the meaning of an image, the only available independent information is the low-level pixel data. Textual annotations always depend on the knowledge, capability of expression and specific language of the annotator and therefore is unreliable. To recognize the displayed scenes from the raw data of an image the algorithms for selection and manipulation of pixels must be combined and parameterized in an adequate manner and finally linked with the natural description. Even the simple linguistic representation of shape or color such as round or yellow requires entirely different mathematical formalization methods, which are neither intuitive nor unique and sound.
[[File:Semantic Gap.svg|thumb|Semantic gap in the context of image analysis|400x400px]]

===Layered systems===
In many [[layered system]]s, some conflicts arise when concepts at a high level of abstraction need to be translated into lower, more concrete [[Artifact (information theory)|artifact]]s. This mismatch is often called '''semantic gap'''.

===Databases===
[[OODBMS]]s (object-oriented database management system) advocates sometimes claim that these databases help to reduce the semantic gap between the application domain ([[miniworld]]) and the traditional RDBMS systems. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0ISJ/is_n2_v33/ai_15519487/pg_4]. However Relational proponents would posit the exact opposite, because by definition object databases fix the data being recorded into a single binding abstraction.

There are also [[situated]] theories of [[economics]], e.g. most [[green economics]], and of [[knowledge]], usually based on some situated ethics.  All emphasize the actual physical, geographical, ecological and infrastructural state the actor is in, which determines that actor's actions or range of actions - all deny that there is any one [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]] from which to apply [[moral standard|standard]]s of or by [[authority]].  This makes such theories unpopular with authority, and popular with those who advocate political [[decentralisation]].

==Embodiment==

Humans pass through Kohlberg/Gilligan's stages of moral development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Kohlberg | first = L. | authorlink =  | title = The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages in Essays on Moral Development, Volume 2 | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | series =  | volume =  | edition =  | date = 1984 | location =  | pages =  | language =  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to stage 3 (Conventional morality:Good Interpersonal Relationships), these stages are compatible with [[Embodied cognition|embodiment]].  Most [[philosophy of law]] emphasizes that the fact that bodies take risk to enforce laws, make laws embodied at least to the degree they are enforced.

However, the stages become problematic when [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] posits a [[universal ethic]]s - that is, a disembodied ethic. All ethical decisions are necessarily situated in a [[world]]. [[Carol Gilligan]]'s view is closer to an [[embodied view]] and emphasizes [[ethical relationship]]s - necessarily between bodies - over universal ethical principles that require a "God's Eye view".  Some ethicists emphasize the role of the [[ethicist]] to sort out '''right versus right''' in a given context.  This is stage 4 but assumes that the ethicist is hesitant to damage relationships or violate principles, e.g. that survival or [[human rights]] take precedence over [[property rights]].

'''Tamar Ross''' is a professor of [[Jewish Philosophy]] at [[Bar-Ilan University]] and considered one of the world's greatest experts on religious feminist philosophy.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Her areas of scholarly expertise include the thought of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], the modern [[Mussar movement|Musar]] movement and the ideology of Mitnaggedism, and Judaism and gender. She is the author of books and articles on Jewish [[Jewish ethics|ethics]] and [[Jewish theology|theology]], contemporary issues in traditional [[Jewish]] thought, [[philosophy]] of [[halakha]], and [[Orthodox Jewish]] [[feminism]].

Prof. Ross makes a vital contribution to philosophical questions around gender in Judaism by arguing that feminism is not external to Torah but rather integral to it. She argues for the concept of evolving revelation, that is, that people learn more as history evolves and societies develop and mature, and  argues against the concept of [[Yeridat ha-dorot]], the idea that knowledge of Torah diminishes with time. She also argues against approaches of more liberal movements which address perceived flaws by challenging the divinity and religious validity of sacred texts and traditions, arguing that such an approach only undermined the foundations faith. She develops the metaphor of "Expanding the Palace of Torah", originally an idea of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], for an approach seeking to address contemporary concerns by expanding rather than undermining religious tradition.

Dr. Ross is on [[Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance]]'s (JOFA)  Advisory Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jofa.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_documents/jofa_scroll_of_honor_final.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905151357/http://www.jofa.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_documents/jofa_scroll_of_honor_final.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-09-05|title=JOFA|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Ross has published widely on many topics relating to Jewish thought and the philosophy of halakha and was selected by the Israeli government as torchbearer in the Independence Day ceremony of 2013 for her contribution to women's learning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jofa.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/site/Community/jofa_program_2013_final.pdf|title=jofa 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shri Timli Sanskrit Pathshala''' (श्री तिमली संस्कृत पाठशाला), established in 1882, is the first [[Sanskrit]] school in [[Garhwal Himalaya]] that was recognized and funded by [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] from 1911 to 1915 and offered high school completion programs in Sanskrit ([[Karmkand|Karmakanda]], [[Tantra]] and [[Vedas|Vedic philosophy]]) to hundreds of students. In 1952 Shri Timli Sanskrit Pathshala introduced an [[English as a Second Language]] program to meet the needs of the students.

From January 2014, Shri Timli Sanskrit Pathshala introduced [[information technology]] and modern science to its curriculum and launched a twelve-month integrated program in Sanskrit and information communication technology.

==History==

===Founders===

Shri Timli Sanskrit Pathshala was founded by Badri Datt Dabral, Damodar Dabral, in association with [[Rao Bahadur]] Kulanand Barthwal, Bhim Singh Bisht and Madho Singh Thokdar in 1882.

The management committee was upgraded in 1950 with [[Rai Saheb]] Radhakrishna Dabral and Umanand Barthwal. OMSOHAM Human Welfare Charitable Trust was registered under Indian Trust Act 1882 in 2009, to revive Shri Timli Sanskrit Pathshala under new name - The Universal Gurukul. Modern science and technologies were included into the curriculum.

===The Universal Gurukul===

Shri Timli Sanskrit Pathshala (श्री तिमली संस्कृत पाठशाला) has been revived in January 2014 where [[Computer]], [[Sanskrit]] and English have been given equal importance. The Universal Gurukul is an alias to Shri Timli Sanskrit Pathshala re-registered under OMSOHAM Human Welfare Charitable Trust.
Shri Timli Sanskrit Pathshala was known for its [[Sanskrit]] education and referred as [[Kashi Vidyapeeth|Kashi]] of [[Garhwal Himalaya]]. [http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/digitalbook/i/inventory%20of%20sanskrit%20scholars.pdf Pandit Sadanand Dabral] - 1877-1950 and Pandit Lalita Prasad Dabral has significantly contributed to Sanskrit literature and [[Tantra]].

===Sanskrit and Computer Science===

The Universal Gurukul (श्री तिमली संस्कृत पाठशाला) has introduced a unique program in which students are trained with holistic development approach. Gurukul is providing Sanskrit education with Computer Science and also conducts seminars on various topics on regular basis.

===Sanskrit Research===
The Universal Gurukul has a Sanskrit Research Center.There have been [http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewArticle/466 suggestions] to use Sanskrit as a [[metalanguage]] for [[knowledge representation]] in e.g. [[machine translation]], and other areas of [[natural language]] processing because of its relatively high regular structure. This is due to [[Classical Sanskrit]] being a regularised, prescriptivist form abstracted from the much more complex and richer [[Vedic Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/digitalbook/i/inventory%20of%20sanskrit%20scholars.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton's use of the term 'hyperobjects' was inspired by [[Björk]]'s 1996 single '[[Hyperballad]]' although the term 'Hyper-objects' (denoting ''n''-dimensional non-local entities) has also been used in computer science since 1967. Morton uses the term to explain objects so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend localization, such as climate change and styrofoam.&lt;ref name="Morton_2010_130"&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; His recent book ''Humankind: Solidarity with Non-Human People'' explores the separation between humans and non-humans and from an object-oriented ontological perspective, arguing that humans need to radically rethink the way in which we conceive of, and relate to, non-human animals and nature as a whole, going on to explore the political implications of such a change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/20/being-ecological-timothy-morton-review|title=Being Ecological by Timothy Morton review – a playfully serious look at the environment|last=Smith|first=P. D.|date=2018-01-20|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morton has also written extensively about the literature of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[Mary Shelley]], [[Romanticism]], diet studies, and ecotheory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UC-Davis Faculty Page|url=http://english.ucdavis.edu/people/directory/tbmorton|accessdate=23 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123005246/http://english.ucdavis.edu/people/directory/tbmorton |archive-date=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==

Morton received a B.A. and D.Phil. in English from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite web|title=UC-Davis Faculty Page|url=http://english.ucdavis.edu/people/directory/tbmorton|accessdate=28 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123005246/http://english.ucdavis.edu/people/directory/tbmorton|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His doctoral dissertation, "Re-Imagining the Body: Shelley and the Languages of Diet," studied the representation of diet, temperance, and consumption in the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley.   According to Morton, the decision to study English literature, as opposed to more academically fashionable classics, stemmed from a desire to engage with modes of thought evolving internationally "including all kinds of continental philosophy that just wasn't happening much in England at the time, what with the war against 'theory' and all."&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

Before obtaining a professorship at Rice University, in 2012, Morton previously taught at the [[University of California, Davis]], [[New York University]] and the [[University of Colorado, Boulder]].&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

==Theoretical works==

Morton's theoretical writings espouse an eclectic approach to scholarship. His subjects include the poetry and literature of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley, the cultural significance and context of food, ecology and environmentalism, and object-oriented ontology [[Object-oriented ontology|OOO]].

===Shelley scholarship===

In 1995, Morton published ''Shelley and the Revolution in Taste: The Body and the Natural World'', an extension of the ideas presented in his doctoral dissertation. Investigating how food came to signify ideological outlook in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Morton's book is an attempt at 'green' cultural criticism, whereby bodies and the social or environmental conditions in which they appear are shown to be interrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|1994|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employing a 'prescriptive' analysis of various Romantic texts, especially Percy Bysshe Shelley's ''A Vindication of Natural Diet'' (1813), Morton argues that the figurative rhetorical elements of these texts should be read not simply as clever language play, but as commands to establish consumptive practices that challenge ideological configurations of how the body relates to normativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|1994|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Morton, authoritarian power dynamics, commodity flows, industrial logic, and the distinction between the domains of nature and culture are inhered in the 'discourses of diet' articulated by the Shelleys. In turn, Shelleyan prose regarding forms of consumption, particularly vegetarianism, is read as a call for social reform and figurative discussions of intemperance and intoxication as warnings against tyranny.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|1994|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Morton has edited two critical volumes on the Shelleyan corpus. In 2002, he published a compilation of critical and historical reflections on Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' entitled ''Mary Shelley's Frankenstein: A Routledge Study Guide and Sourcebook''. Then, in 2006, Morton edited ''The Cambridge Companion to Shelley'', an interdisciplinary overview of Percy Bysshe Shelley's themes, language, narrative structure, literary philosophy, and political views.

===Diet studies===

From 2000 to 2004, Morton published three works dealing with the intersection of food and cultural studies. In the first of these to be published, ''The Poetics of Spice: Romantic Consumerism and the Exotic'' (2000), Morton unpacked the evolution of European consumer culture through an analysis of the figurative use of spice in Romantic literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2000|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Viewing spice as a cultural artifact that functioned "as discourse, not object, naively transparent to itself"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2000|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  during the Romantic period, he elucidates two general characteristics of the poetics of spice: materiality and transumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 'materiality' of spice connects its symbolic and social roles with its capacity for desire production. Morton cites the "trade winds topos" (perfumed breeze believed to waft from exotic lands in which spices are domestic) in Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' as an example, concluding that Milton prefigures the symbolic use of spice in later works by presenting Satan's journey from Hell to Chaos as a parallel to the travels of spice traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2000|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, 'transumption', following Harold Bloom's deployment of the rhetorical concept, entails the use of a metasignifier that "serves as a figure for poetic language itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Morton, the works of John Dryden exemplify transumption, revealing "a novel kind of capitalist poetics, relying on the representation of the spice trade...Spice is not a balm, but an object of trade, a trope to be carried across boundaries, standing in for money: a metaphor about metaphor."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2000|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carrying this idea forward to the Romantic era, Morton critiques the manner in which spice became a metaphor for exotic desire that, subsequently, encapsulated the self-reflexivity of modern processes of commodification.

Later, Morton edited ''Radical Food: The Culture and Politics of Eating and Drinking, 1790-1820'' (2000), a three-volume compendium of eighteenth century texts examining the literary, sociocultural, and political history of food, including works on intoxication, cannibalism, and slavery. He also edited ''Cultures of Taste/Theories of Appetite: Eating Romanticism'' (2004), a collection of essays that problematizes the use of taste and appetite as Romantic metaphors for bounded territories and subjectivities, while empirically interrogating the organization of Romantic cultural and economic structures around competing logics of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2004|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological theory===

Since 2009, Morton has engaged in a sustained project of ecological critique, primarily enunciated in two works, ''Ecology Without Nature'' (2007) and ''The Ecological Thought'' (2010), through which he problematizes environmental theory from the standpoint of ecological entanglement. In ''Ecology Without Nature'', Morton proposes that an ecological criticism must be divested of the bifurcation of nature and civilization, or the idea that nature exists as something that sustains civilization, but exists outside of society's walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Morton states:

{{quote| Ecological writing keeps insisting that we are "embedded" in nature. Nature is a surrounding medium that sustains our being. Due to the properties of the rhetoric that evokes the idea of a surrounding medium, ecological writing can never properly establish that this is nature and thus provide a compelling and consistent aesthetic basis for the new worldview that is meant to change society. It is a small operation, like tipping over a domino...Putting something called Nature on a pedestal and admiring it from afar does for the environment what patriarchy does for the figure of Woman. It is a paradoxical act of sadistic admiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2007|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   }}

Viewing "nature," in the putative sense, as an arbitrary textual signifier, Morton theorizes artistic representations of the environment as sites for opening ideas of nature to new possibilities. Seeking an aesthetic mode that can account for the differential, paradoxical, and nonidentificational character of the environment, he proposes a materialist method of textual analysis called 'ambient poetics', in which artistic texts of all kinds are considered in terms of how they manage the space in which they appear, thereby attuning the sensibilities of their audience to forms of natural representation that contravene the ideological coding of nature as a transcendent principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historicizing this form of poetics permits the politicization of environmental art and its 'ecomimesis', or authenticating evocation of the author's environment, such that the experience of its phenomena becomes present for and shared with the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2007|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art is also an important theme in ''The Ecological Thought'', a "prequel" to ''Ecology Without Nature'', in which Morton proposes the concept of 'dark ecology' as a means of expressing the "irony, ugliness, and horror" of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the vantage point of dark ecology, there exists no neutral theoretical ground on which to articulate ecological claims. Instead, all beings are always already implicated within the ecological, necessitating an acknowledgement of coexistential difference for coping with ecological catastrophe that, according to Morton, "has already occurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related to dark ecology is Morton's concept of the 'mesh'. Defining the ecological thought as "the thinking of interconnectedness," Morton thus uses 'mesh' to refer to the interconnectedness of all living and non-living things, consisting of "infinite connections and infinitesimal differences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He explains:

{{quote| The ecological thought does, indeed, consist in the ramifications of the "truly wonderful fact" of the mesh. All life forms are the mesh, and so are all the dead ones, as are their habitats, which are also made up of living and nonliving beings. We know even more now about how life forms have shaped Earth (think of oil, of oxygen&amp;mdash;the first climate change cataclysm). We drive around using crushed dinosaur parts. Iron is mostly a by-product of bacterial metabolism. So is oxygen. Mountains can be made of shells and fossilized bacteria. Death and the mesh go together in another sense, too, because natural selection implies extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The mesh has no central position that privileges any one form of being over others, and thereby erases definitive interior and exterior boundaries of beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emphasizing the interdependence of beings, the ecological thought "permits no distance," such that all beings are said to relate to each other in a totalizing open system, negatively and differentially, rendering ambiguous those entities with which we presume familiarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morton calls these ambiguously inscribed beings 'strange strangers', or beings unable to be completely comprehended and labeled.&lt;ref name="Morton_2010_41"&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the mesh, even the strangeness of strange strangers relating coexistentially is strange, meaning that the more we know about an entity, the stranger it becomes. Intimacy, then, becomes threatening because it veils the mesh beneath the illusion of familiarity.&lt;ref name="Morton_2010_41"/&gt;

===Object-oriented ontology===

Morton became involved with object-oriented ontology after his ecological writings were favorably compared with the movement's ideas. One way that his work can be distinguished from other variants of object-oriented thought is by its focus on the causal dimension of object relations. Against traditional causal philosophies, Morton argues that causality is an aesthetic dimension of relations between objects, wherein sensory experience does not indicate direct access to reality, but rather an uncanny interruption of the false ontic equilibrium of an interobjective system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morton|first=Timothy|title=Shoplifting Advice|url=http://ecologywithoutnature.blogspot.com/2011/04/shoplifting-advice.html|work=Ecology Without Nature|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Causation, in this view, is held to be illusion-like or "magical," forming the core of what Morton terms "realist magic."

====Hyperobjects====

In ''The Ecological Thought'', Morton employed the term ''hyperobjects'' to describe objects that are so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend spatiotemporal specificity, such as global warming, styrofoam, and radioactive plutonium.&lt;ref name="Morton_2010_130"/&gt;  He has subsequently enumerated five characteristics of hyperobjects:

# '''Viscous:''' Hyperobjects adhere to any other object they touch, no matter how hard an object tries to resist. In this way, hyperobjects overrule ironic distance, meaning that the more an object tries to resist a hyperobject, the more glued to the hyperobject it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morton|first=Timothy|title=Hyperobjects are Viscous|url=http://ecologywithoutnature.blogspot.com/2010/10/hyperobjects-are-viscous.html|work=Ecology Without Nature|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Molten:''' Hyperobjects are so massive that they refute the idea that spacetime is fixed, concrete, and consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffield|first=Kris|title=Interview: Timothy Morton|url=http://fracturedpolitics.com/2011/07/05/interview-timothy-morton.aspx|work=Fractured Politics|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Nonlocal:''' Hyperobjects are massively distributed in time and space to the extent that their totality cannot be realized in any particular local manifestation. For example, global warming is a hyperobject that impacts meteorological conditions, such as tornado formation. According to Morton, though, objects don't feel global warming, but instead experience tornadoes as they cause damage in specific places. Thus, nonlocality describes the manner in which a hyperobject becomes more substantial than the local manifestations they produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morton|first=Timothy|title=Hyperobjects are Nonlocal|url=http://ecologywithoutnature.blogspot.com/2010/11/hyperobjects-are-nonlocal.html|work=Ecology Without Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Phased:''' Hyperobjects occupy a higher-dimensional space than other entities can normally perceive. Thus, hyperobjects appear to come and go in three-dimensional space, but would appear differently if an observer could have a higher multidimensional view.&lt;ref name="Coffield"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffield|first=Kris|title=Interview: Timothy Morton|url=http://fracturedpolitics.com/2011/07/05/interview-timothy-morton.aspx|work=Fractured Politics|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Interobjective:''' Hyperobjects are formed by relations between more than one object. Consequently, objects are only able to perceive to the imprint, or "footprint," of a hyperobject upon other objects, revealed as information. For example, global warming is formed by interactions between the Sun, fossil fuels, and carbon dioxide, among other objects. Yet, global warming is made apparent through emissions levels, temperature changes, and ocean levels, making it seem as if global warming is a product of scientific models, rather than an object that predated its own measurement.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;

According to Morton, hyperobjects not only become visible during an age of ecological crisis, but alert humans to the ecological dilemmas defining the age in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=Timothy|title=Sublime Objects|journal=Speculations|year=2011|volume=II|pages=207–227|url=http://www.publicpraxis.com/speculations/?page_id=326|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the existential capacity of hyperobjects to outlast a turn toward less materialistic cultural values, coupled with the threat many such objects pose toward organic matter (what Morton calls a "demonic inversion of the sacred substances of religion"), gives them a potential spiritual quality, in which their treatment by future societies may become indistinguishable from reverential care.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[biosemiotics|semiotic theories]] of [[Jakob von Uexküll]] and [[Thomas Sebeok|Thomas A. Sebeok]], '''''umwelt''''' (plural: umwelten; from the German ''[[wikt:Umwelt|Umwelt]]'' meaning "environment" or "surroundings") is the "biological foundations that lie at the very epicenter of the study of both [[communication]] and [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] in the human [and non-human] animal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas A. |last=Sebeok |title=Contributions to the Doctrine of Signs |location=Lisse, Netherlands |publisher=Peter de Ridder Press |year=1976 |chapter=Foreword |page=x |isbn=0-87750-194-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The following reference seems to be incorrect, the phrase quoted comes up with a reference to Deely 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jakob von Uexküll|Uexküll, Jakob von]] 1920, 1934/1957; cf. Lorenz, Konrad 1971 (Studies in animal behaviour, Vol 2. Cambridge MA: Harvard Univ. Press)&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The term is usually translated as "self-centered world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Kalevi Kull |last=Kull |first=Kalevi |year=2010 |chapter=Umwelt |editor-last=Cobley |editor-first=Paul |title=The Routledge Companion to Semiotics |location=London |publisher=Routledge |pages=348–349 |isbn=978-0-415-44072-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Uexküll theorised that organisms can have different ''umwelten'', even though they share the same environment. The subject of ''umwelt'' and Uexküll's work is described by [[Dorion Sagan]] in an introduction to a collection of translations.&lt;ref name=Sagan&gt;{{cite book |title=A Foray Into the Worlds of Animals and Humans: With a Theory of Meaning |author=Dorion Sagan |editor1=Jakob von Uexküll |editor2=Marina von Uexküll |editor3=Joseph D.

==Discussion==

Each functional component of an ''umwelt'' has a [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] and so represents the organism's [[model (abstract)|model]] of the world. These functional components correspond approximately to perceptual features,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treisman|first1=Anne M.|last2=Gelade|first2=Garry|title=A feature-integration theory of attention|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=1980|volume=12|issue=1|pages=97–136|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(80)90005-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as described by [[Anne Treisman]]. It is also the [[semiotic]] world of the organism, including all the meaningful aspects of the world for any particular organism, i.e. it can be water, food, shelter, potential threats, or points of reference for navigation. An organism creates and reshapes its own ''umwelt'' when it interacts with the world. This is termed a 'functional circle'. The ''umwelt'' theory states that the mind and the world are inseparable, because it is the mind that interprets the world for the organism. Consequently, the ''umwelten'' of different organisms differ, which follows from the individuality and uniqueness of the history of every single organism. When two ''umwelten'' interact, this creates a [[semiosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thure von |last=Uexküll |year=1987 |chapter=The sign theory of Jakob von Uexküll |editor-last=Krampen |title=Classics of Semiotics |location=New York |publisher=Plenum |pages=147–179 |isbn=0-306-42321-9 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jakob von |last=Uexküll |chapter=A Stroll Through the Worlds of Animals and Men: A Picture Book of Invisible Worlds |title=Instinctive Behavior: The Development of a Modern Concept |editor-first=Claire H. |editor-last=Schiller |location=New York |publisher=International Universities Press |year=1957 |pages=5– }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, ''umwelt'' also unites all the semiotic processes of an organism into a whole. Internally, an organism is the sum of its parts operating in functional circles and, to survive, all the parts must work cooperatively. This is termed the "collective ''umwelt''" which models the organism as a centralised system from the cellular level upward. This requires the [[semiosis]] of any one part to be continuously connected to any other semiosis operating within the same organism. If anything disrupts this process, the organism will not operate efficiently.

Uexküll's writings show a specific interest in the various worlds that he believed to exist ('conceptually') from the point of view of the ''umwelt'' of different creatures such as [[tick]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[amoebae]], [[jellyfish]] and [[sea worms]].

The [[biosemiotic]] turn in Jakob von Uexküll's analysis occurs in his discussion of the animal's relationship with its environment. The ''umwelt'' is for him an environment-world which is, according to [[Agamben]], ''"constituted by a more or less broad series of elements [called] 'carriers of significance' or 'marks' which are the only things that interest the animal"''. Agamben goes on to paraphrase Uexküll's example of the tick, saying,
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"...this eyeless animal finds the way to her watchpoint [at the top of a tall blade of grass] with the help of only its skin’s general sensitivity to light. The approach of her prey becomes apparent to this blind and deaf bandit only through her sense of smell. The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, works on the tick as a signal that causes her to abandon her post (on top of the blade of grass/bush) and fall blindly downward toward her prey. If she is fortunate enough to fall on something warm (which she perceives by means of an organ sensible to a precise temperature) then she has attained her prey, the warm-blooded animal, and thereafter needs only the help of her sense of touch to find the least hairy spot possible and embed herself up to her head in the cutaneous tissue of her prey. She can now slowly suck up a stream of warm blood."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, for the tick, the ''umwelt'' is reduced to only three (biosemiotic) carriers of significance: (1) The [[odor]] of [[butyric acid]], which emanates from the [[sebaceous]] follicles of all mammals, (2) The [[temperature]] of 37°C (corresponding to the [[blood]] of all mammals), (3) The hairy topography of mammals.

==Critics==
Uexküll's application of the notion of "umwelt" to the human person has been contested. In "Welt und Umwelt" and "Die Wahrheit der Dinge", the philosopher and sociologist [[Josef Pieper]] argued that reason allows the human person to live in "Welt" (world) while plants and animals do indeed live in an Umwelt—a notion he traces back far beyond Uexküll to [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]].

'''Will Kymlicka''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|m|l|ɪ|k|ə}}; born 1962) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] best known for his work on [[multiculturalism]] and [[animal ethics]]. He is currently [[Professor]] of Philosophy and [[Canada Research Chair]] in Political Philosophy at [[Queen's University at Kingston]], and Recurrent Visiting Professor in the Nationalism Studies program at the [[Central European University]] in [[Budapest]], Hungary. For over 20 years, he has lived a [[Veganism|vegan]] lifestyle, and he is married to the Canadian author and [[animal rights]] activist [[Sue Donaldson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Will Kymlicka from June 2015|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/philosoph-will-kymlicka-tiere-sind-nicht-unsere-sklaven-1.2466112|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
Kymlicka received his [[Bachelor's degree|B.A.]] (Honours) in [[philosophy]] and [[political science|political studies]] from [[Queen's University]] in 1984, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] in philosophy from [[Oxford University]] in 1987, under the direction of [[G. A. Cohen]]. He has written extensively on multiculturalism and political philosophy, and several of his books have been translated into other languages. Kymlicka has held professorships at a variety of different universities in Canada and abroad, and has also worked as an advisor to the [[Government of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://post.queensu.ca/~kymlicka/biography.php "Biography"], Will Kymlicka's Homepage.

==Thought==
One of his main concerns throughout his work is providing a [[Liberalism|liberal]] framework for the just treatment of minority groups, which he divides into two basic categories: polyethnic or immigrant groups, and national minorities (such as the Canadian [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]], or the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]]). He lists criteria for national minorities or "minority nations":
# present at founding;
# prior history of self-government;
# common culture;
# common language;
# governing selves through institutions.
By these criteria, the two "minority nations" in Canada are the [[First Nations]] population and the Québécois.  Kymlicka argues that such minority groups deserve unique rights from the state by the nature of their unique role and history within the national population. ("Group rights" are also a recent innovation in Western democracy, which, from the [[Glorious Revolution]] up to the enfranchisement of women, emphasized individual rights as fundamental, and avoided assigning rights to particular groups, geographic, religious, linguistic or ethnic.)

Polyethnic groups are less deserving of such rights since they come to the state voluntarily and thus have some degree of responsibility to [[social integration|integrate]] to the norms of their new nation. This does not mean that they are not entitled to any rights as Kymlicka argues that all cultural minorities have a right to choose their own lives, but it does mean that they are not entitled to the same level of group rights which minority nations would be entitled to. Kymlicka makes various exceptions such as the problems faced by refugees, whether from conflict or poverty, and by such minority groups such as African-Americans (whose heritage in America clearly did not begin voluntarily) and argues that their needs with regards to cultural group-specific rights should be considered on a special basis.

In ''Multicultural Citizenship'' (1995), Kymlicka argues that group-specific rights are consistent with liberalism, and are particularly appropriate, if not outright demanded, in certain situations. He defines three such group-specific rights: special group representation rights (such as affirmative action policies in politics); self-government rights; and polyethnic rights (such as the policy exempting [[Sikh]]s from having to wear motorcycle helmets).

A distinction that Kymlicka draws, which is crucial to his liberal defence of group-specific rights for minorities, is between external protection and internal restrictions. Kymlicka argues that external protections between groups may be justified in order to promote equality (but they must not allow for oppression or exploitation, as in [[apartheid]] in South Africa). Internal restrictions, however, cannot be justified from a liberal perspective, insofar as they restrict a person's autonomy, though they may be granted in certain cases to national minorities.

==Thoughts on human rights==
The standard liberal criticism which states that group rights are problematic because they often treat individuals as mere carriers of group identities rather than autonomous social agents is overstated or oversimplified. The actual problem of minorities and how they should be viewed in liberal democracies is much more complex. There is a distinction between good group rights, bad group rights, and intolerable group rights.
# Bad Group Rights (internal restrictions) are rules imposed by the group upon intra-group relations. Most often take the form of the group restricting the liberty of individual members in the name of group solidarity. Indigenous groups try to protect themselves from women's movements on the basis that they threaten the social and traditional role of indigenous populations. He contends this raises the danger of individual oppression. Internal restrictions can be used to uphold violent, dominant, absolutist systems. Legally imposed internal restrictions are thus bad and almost always unjust. Not to mention they go against liberal ideals.
# Good Group Rights (external protections) involve inter-group relations. Indigenous groups need protection in terms of their nationals identities by limiting the vulnerability of that group to the decisions of external groups or society. Therefore, they should have the right to their own taxation, health care, education, and governance.

==Thoughts on animal rights==
The book ''Zoopolis'', by [[Sue Donaldson]] and co-authored with Kymlicka, explores the state of animal rights.

Donaldson and Kymlicka believe that [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionism]] is an inadequate response to both the ethical and practical challenges of living fairly and constructively with other animals.

Donaldson and Kymlicka suggest that animals should be characterized through three categories, serving to determine the nature of the laws that should protect those animals. [[Domestic animal]]s should be given a kind of adjusted co-citizenship in which their best interest and preferences would be taken into account. Wild animals should be granted sovereignty on their land enough so that they can sustain their way of living and prosper. "Liminal" animals (such as mice, pigeons and insects) should be treated as denizens of cities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Zoopolis-Political-Theory-Animal-Rights/dp/0199599661 Zoopolis: A Political Theory of Animal Rights, Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://post.queensu.ca/~kymlicka/ Will Kymlicka's home page, where he discloses that he is married to co-author Sue Donaldson.]&lt;/ref&gt;
