==History==
[[Image:Ayer Mill View.jpg|thumb|Ayer Mill, Lawrence, Massachusetts]]

===1899-1950===
The American Woolen Company was established in 1899 under the leadership of [[William Madison Wood|William M. Wood]] and his father-in-law [[Frederick Ayer]] through the consolidation of eight financially troubled [[New England]] [[wool]]en mills. At the company's height in the 1920s, it owned and operated 60 woolen mills across New England. It is most known for its role in the [[Lawrence Textile Strike]] of 1912.

The American Woolen Company was the product of the era of [[trust (19th century)|trusts]]. [[Overproduction]], competition and poor management had brought the [[New England]] textile industry to its knees by the 1890s. In particular, family trusts, the main shareholders of many of the mills, insisted on receiving high [[dividend]]s instead of making necessary capital improvements. Frederick Ayer, successful [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] merchant, purchased the Washington Mills in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], and hired his son-in-law, William M. Wood to run it. Wood had already successfully turned around a bankrupt mill in [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]]. With Ayer's financial backing, Wood brought together various under-performing mills in the aim of reducing competition and increasing prices. He convinced investors to permit profits to be reinvested into new plants and machinery.

[[Image:Wood Mill Lawrence.jpg|thumb|left|Wood Mill, Lawrence]]
In 1901, the company purchased the failing [[Burlington Mills]] in [[Winooski, Vermont]], and restored their profitability. These mills closed in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mills-Winooski-Falls-Burlington-Vermont/dp/B000JPXEPE|title=The Mills at Winooski Falls: Winooski and Burlington, Vermont|date=2000|publisher=Onion River Press|isbn=9780965714440|editor-last=Krawitt|editor-first=Laura|edition=First|location=Winooski, Vt.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the American Woolen Company built the largest mill in the world, the Wood Mill in Lawrence, followed by the neighboring Ayer Mill in 1909. The Ayer mill's 22 foot diameter 4-sided clocktower is only a foot smaller than [[Big Ben]] and purportedly only second to it in size in the world (among chiming 4-sided clocktowers).

Following the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike]], the AWC was forced to increase wages. The company reached its apogee in the 1920s, when it controlled 20% of the country's woolen production. Most of these mill operations had started as 100% water-powered, but added coal-fueled steampower in the late 1800s as demand exceeded what could be provided by water alone. However, even though technology was continually updated, these unionized New England mills were unable to compete with non-unionized Southern mills able to produce staple woolen products, such as blankets, more cheaply. Additionally, fashions changed with the introduction of polyester and rayon, and demand for worsted wool plummeted by the mid-1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Zappalla, "A Financial History of the American Woolen Company". (MBA Thesis, University of Pennsylvania, 1947)&lt;/ref&gt;  The two world wars were a boon to the AWC, keeping the company prosperous into 1945. American Woolen Company ranked 51st among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] military production contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] &amp; [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workers housing===
In 1902 the Company built [[Presidential Village, Maynard, Massachusetts|New Village]], a neighborhood of rental units for workers at its mill [[Maynard, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="ParkBorders"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Park|first1=Edwin|title=Maynard's Fate Hangs on Tariff: Largest Woolen Mill in World Within Its Borders|url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/501250227/fulltextPDF/3BD48FE96B44181PQ/8?accountid=10226|accessdate=27 October 2017|publisher=Boston Globe|date=13 May 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shawsheen Village Historic District|Shawsheen Village]] which was Built in Andover Massachusetts in the former Frye Village, was built to house the middle to upper management of the American Woolen Company which was headquartered in Shawsheen Village in Andover Massachusetts.  The village was divided into two distinct groups.  One being red brick house built for upper management and one being white colonial style houses built for middle management.

===1950-present===
Following the end of the [[Korean War]], government contracts ended. Virtually [[bankruptcy in the United States|bankrupt]], the American Woolen Co. was purchased by [[Textron]] and incorporated into its [[Amerotron]] division in 1955.

In 1966 an Uxbridge, Massachusetts-based, wool blanket contractor purchased the American Woolen Company trademark in order to better support its business activity of the manufacturing and distribution of woolen blankets for the American domestic market. In 1987, American Woolen sold its Uxbridge blanket manufacturing facility, relocated to Miami, Florida, and focused its activity on the importing and wholesaling of woolen blankets targeting relief organizations, municipalities, aid agencies and the general hospitality sector.

In 2013 an investment group led by Jacob Harrison Long completed the purchase, carve out and realignment of American Woolen Company’s business activity with the intent to focus the company on the design and manufacture of fine American-made [[worsted]] and [[woolen]] apparel fabrics.

[[File:DRA 4721 web.jpg|thumb|DRA 4721 web]]In June 2014, American Woolen purchased the Warren Mills complex from Italian luxury apparel group Loro Piana SpA,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wtnh.com/2014/06/20/connecticut-wool-mill-to-reopen-under-new-owner/|title=Connecticut wool mill to reopen under new owner|date=2014-06-20|work=WTNH Connecticut News|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had owned and operated the mill for 26 years. Recognized as being "on par with the best mills in Europe,”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stafford Springs, Connecticut based Warren Mills is American Woolen Company's headquarters where the company produces worsted wool for men's suits and cashmere and camel hair for coats. The acquisition was made with the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, which provided American Woolen Company with a loan and a grant to help cover the building acquisition costs. The acquisition was made with the intent to "reintroduce luxury worsted and woolen textile manufacturing to the United States.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Ammianus Marcellinus''' (born {{circa|330}},&lt;ref&gt;[https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&amp;cqlMode=true&amp;query=nid%3D118502581 Ammianus, Marcellinus] Deutsche National Bibliothek&lt;/ref&gt; died {{circa|lk=no|391}}{{snd}}400) was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] soldier and historian who wrote the penultimate major historical account surviving from antiquity (preceding [[Procopius]]). His work, known as the '''''Res Gestae''''', chronicled in Latin the history of Rome from the accession of the Emperor [[Nerva]] in 96 to the death of [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, although only the sections covering the period 353–378 survive.&lt;ref name = "Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007199/Ammianus-Marcellinus Encyclopædia Britannica Online – Ammianus Marcellinus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Ramsay | first = William | authorlink = William Ramsay (classical scholar) | title = Ammmianus Marcellinus | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 142–144 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0151.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Bust of Constantius II (Mary Harrsch).jpg|thumb|200 px|A bust of Emperor [[Constantius II]] from Syria.]]
Ammianus was born in the [[Koine Greek|Greek]]-speaking East,&lt;ref name="Greek"&gt;''Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Classical World,'' Israel Shatzman, Michael Avi-Yonah, 1975 Harper and Row, p.37, {{ISBN|0-06-010178-4}} &lt;br&gt;''East and West Through Fifteen Centuries: Being a General History from B.C. 44 to A.D. 1453,'' George Frederick Young, 1916 Longmans, Green and Co, p. 336 &lt;br&gt;University of California Publications in Linguistics, University of California, Berkeley, 1943 University of California Press, p. 3 &lt;br&gt;Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes, Cambridge University Press, p. lxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Britannica"/&gt; possibly in [[Syria Palaestina|Syria]] or [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenicia]].&lt;ref&gt;Following earlier scholars, Matthews (1989: 8) suggested a hometown of [[Antioch|Antioch on the Orontes]] based on the assumption that Ammianus was the recipient of a letter from a pagan contemporary, Libanius, to a certain Marcellinus; however Formara in 1992 argued that this letter must have referred in fact to a younger man and an orator newly arrived in Rome, rather than Ammianus, who had long been a resident in the City, and Barnes (1998: 57–58) solidified this stance in modern scholarship. However, many scholars remain convinced that Ammianus was a native of Antioch.&lt;/ref&gt; His native language was most likely [[Koine Greek|Greek]];&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Norden, ''Antika Kunstprosa'' (Leipzig 1909), 648.&lt;/ref&gt; he learned [[Latin]] as a second language, and was probably familiar with [[Syriac language|Syriac]] as well. The surviving books of his history cover the years 353 to 378.&lt;ref&gt;The Eye of Command, Kimberly Kagan, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ammianus served as a soldier in the army of [[Constantius II]] and [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] in Gaul and [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]]. He professes to have been "a former soldier and a [[Greek people|Greek]]" (''miles quondam et graecus''),&lt;ref&gt;Amm. 31.16.9&lt;/ref&gt; and his enrollment among the elite ''protectores domestici'' (household guards) shows that he was of middle class or higher birth. Consensus is that Ammianus probably came from a curial family, but it is also possible that he was the son of a ''comes Orientis'' of the same family name. He entered the army at an early age, when [[Constantius II]] was emperor of the East, and was sent to serve under [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], governor of [[Nisibis]] in [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]], and ''magister militum''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[File:Diyarbakirwalls2.jpg|thumb|The walls of Amida, built by [[Constantius II]] before the [[Siege of Amida]] of 359. Ammianus himself was present in the city until a day before its fall.]]
He returned with Ursicinus to Italy when Ursicinus was recalled by Constantius to begin an expedition against [[Claudius Silvanus]]. Silvanus had been forced by the allegedly false accusations of his enemies into proclaiming himself emperor in [[Gaul]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Ammianus campaigned in the East twice under Ursicinus. On one occasion, he became separated from the officer's entourage and took refuge in [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]] during the [[Siege of Amida|siege of the city]] by the Sassanids under King [[Shapur II]]; he reportedly barely escaped with his life.&lt;ref&gt;The Eye of Command, Kimberly Kagan pp29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ursicinus was dismissed from his military post by Constantius, Ammianus too seems to have retired from the military; however, reevaluation of his participation in [[Julian (emperor)|Julian's]] Persian campaigns has led modern scholarship to suggest that he continued his service but did not for some reason include the period in his history.
He accompanied Julian, for whom he expresses enthusiastic admiration, in his campaigns against the [[Alamanni]] and the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
After Julian's death, Ammianus accompanied the retreat of the new emperor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], as far as Antioch. 
He was residing in Antioch in 372 when a certain [[Theodorus (usurper)|Theodorus]] was thought to have been identified the successor to the emperor [[Valens]] by divination. 
Speaking as an alleged eyewitness, Marcellinus recounts how Theodorus and several others were made to confess their deceit through the use of torture, and cruelly punished.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[File:IVLIANVS.png|thumb|200 px|Portrait of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] on a bronze coin of [[Antioch]]]] 
He eventually settled in Rome and began the ''Res Gestae''. The precise year of his death is unknown, but scholarly consensus places it somewhere between 392 and 400 at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Gavin, ''Ammianus Marcellinus: The Allusive Historian'' s.104ff, Cambridge 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Timothy D., Ammianus Marcellinus and the Representation of Historical Reality, Ithaca, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship generally describes Ammianus as a pagan who was tolerant of Christianity.&lt;ref name="Treadgold1997"&gt;For example, {{cite book|author=Warren T. Treadgold|title=A history of the Byzantine state and society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYbnr5XVbzUC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=22 August 2010|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2630-6|pages=133–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcellinus writes of Christianity as being a pure and simple religion that demands only what is just and mild, and when he condemns the actions of Christians, he does not do so on the basis of their Christianity as such.&lt;ref&gt;E.D. Hunt "Christians and Christianity in Ammianus Marcellinus", ''Classical Quarterly'', new series, '''35''' (1985), pp. 193, 195 https://www.jstor.org/stable/638815&lt;/ref&gt; His lifetime was marked by lengthy outbreaks of sectarian and dogmatic strife within the new state-backed faith, often with violent consequences (especially the [[Arian controversy]]) and these conflicts sometimes appeared unworthy to him, though it was territory where he could not risk going very far in criticism, due to the growing and volatile political connections between the church and imperial power.

He was not blind to the faults of Christians or of pagans; he observed in his ''Res Gestae'' that "no wild beasts are so deadly to humans as most Christians are to each other."&lt;ref&gt;Marcellinus, 22.5.4. E.D. Hunt considers this observation to be original to Marcellinus: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/638815 E.D. Hunt "Christians and Christianity in Ammianus Marcellinus"], ''Classical Quarterly'', new series, '''35''' (1985), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; and he condemns his hero Julian for excessive attachment to (pagan) sacrifice, and for his edict effectively barring Christians from teaching posts.&lt;ref&gt;E.D. Hunt "Christians and Christianity in Ammianus Marcellinus", ''Classical Quarterly'', new series, '''35''' (1985), p. 198 https://www.jstor.org/stable/638815&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
While living in Rome in the 380s, Ammianus wrote a Latin history of the Roman empire from the accession of [[Nerva]] (96) to the death of Valens at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] (378),&lt;ref&gt;The Eye of Command, Kimberly Kagan, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; in effect writing a continuation of the history of [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He presumably completed the work before 391, as at 22.16.12 he praises the [[Serapeum]] in Egypt as the glory of the empire; it was in that same year the Emperor granted the temple grounds to a Christian bishop, provoking pagans into barricading themselves in the temple, plundering its contents, and torturing Christians, ultimately destroying the temple. The ''Res Gestae'' (''Rerum gestarum Libri XXXI'') was originally composed of thirty-one books, but the first thirteen have been lost (historian T.D. Barnes argues that the original was actually thirty-six books, which if correct would mean that eighteen books have been lost{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}). The surviving eighteen books cover the period from 353 to 378.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fisher, H. A. L.|authorlink=H. A. L. Fisher|title=The Last Latin Historian|journal=The Quarterly Review|volume=230|date=July 1918|pages=39|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092529544;view=1up;seq=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; It constitutes the foundation of modern understanding of the history of the fourth century Roman Empire. It is lauded as a clear, comprehensive, and generally impartial account of events by a contemporary;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} like many ancient historians, however, Ammianus was in fact not impartial, although he expresses an intention to be so, and had strong moral and religious prejudices. Although criticised as lacking literary merit by his early biographers, he was in fact quite skilled in rhetoric, which significantly has brought the veracity of some of the ''Res Gestae'' into question.

His work has suffered substantially from manuscript transmission. Aside from the loss of the first thirteen books, the remaining eighteen are in many places corrupt and [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunose]]. The sole surviving manuscript from which almost every other is derived is a ninth-century [[Charlemagne|Carolingian]] text, Vatican lat. 1873 (''V''), produced in [[Fulda]] from an insular exemplar. The only independent textual source for Ammianus lies in Fragmenta Marbugensia (''M''), another ninth-century [[Franks|Frankish]] [[codex]] which was taken apart to provide covers for account-books during the fifteenth century. Only six leaves of ''M'' survive; however, before this manuscript was dismantled the Abbot of Hersfeld lent the manuscript to [[Sigismund Gelenius]], who used it in preparing the text of the second Froben edition (''G''). The dates and relationship of V and M were long disputed until 1936 when R. P. Robinson demonstrated persuasively that V was copied from M. As L.D. Reynolds summarizes, "M is thus a fragment of the archetype; symptoms of an insular pre-archetype are evident."&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;L.D. Reynolds (ed.), ''Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), pp. 6ff&lt;/ref&gt;

His handling from his earliest printers was little better. The ''[[editio princeps]]'' was printed in 1474 in Rome by Georg Sachsel and Bartholomaeus Golsch, which broke off at the end of Book 26. The next edition (Bologna, 1517) suffered from its editor's  conjectures upon the poor text of the 1474 edition; the 1474 edition was pirated for the first Froben edition (Basle, 1518). It was not until 1533 that the last five books of Ammianus' history were put into print by Silvanus Otmar and edited by Mariangelus Accursius. The first modern edition was produced by C.U. Clark (Berlin, 1910–1913).&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; The first English translations were by [[Philemon Holland]] in 1609, and later by [[Charles Duke Yonge|C.D. Yonge]] in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Rolfe's bibliographical note to his Loeb Classical Library translation, p. xlviii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Ammianus Marcellinus 1533.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A copy of the ''Res Gestae'' from 1533]]
[[Edward Gibbon]] judged Ammianus "an accurate and faithful guide, who composed the history of his own times without indulging the prejudices and passions which usually affect the mind of a contemporary."&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter 26.5&lt;/ref&gt; But he also condemned Ammianus for lack of literary flair: "The coarse and undistinguishing pencil of Ammianus has delineated his bloody figures with tedious and disgusting accuracy."&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Chapter 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian historian [[:de:Ernst Stein (Historiker)|Ernst Stein]] praised Ammianus as "the greatest literary genius that the world produced between Tacitus and Dante".&lt;ref&gt;E. Stein, ''Geschichte des spätrömischen Reiches,'' Vienna 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Kimberly Kagan]], his accounts of battles emphasize the experience of the soldiers but at the cost of ignoring the bigger picture.  As a result, it is difficult for the reader to understand why the battles he describes had the outcome they did.&lt;ref&gt;The Eye of Command, Kimberly Kagan, pp. 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammianus' work contains a detailed description of the [[365 Crete earthquake|tsunami]] in Alexandria which devastated the metropolis and the shores of the eastern Mediterranean on 21 July 365. His report describes accurately the characteristic sequence of earthquake, retreat of the sea and sudden giant wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=4135013 |pages=141–167 |last1=Kelly |first1=G. |title=Ammianus and the Great Tsunami |volume=94 |journal=The Journal of Roman Studies |year=2004 |doi=10.2307/4135013}} Note that in the fifth century BC the Greek historian [[Thucydides]] had already connected these seismic events in his ''Peloponnesian War''(see Book I, 22).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], "[i]t is a striking fact that Ammianus, though a professional soldier, gives excellent pictures of social and economic problems, and in his attitude to the non-Roman peoples of the empire he is far more broad-minded than writers like Livy and Tacitus; his digressions on the various countries he had visited are peculiarly interesting. In his description of the empire—the exhaustion produced by excessive taxation, the financial ruin of the middle classes, the progressive decline in the morale of the army—we find the explanation of its [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]] before the Goths twenty years after his death."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{Clear}}

'''Ani Pachen''' (1933–2002) was a Tibetan freedom fighter and activist. 

==Early life==
Pachen Dolma was born around 1933 in [[Gonjo]], Kham, eastern [[Tibet]]. She was the only child of [[Chieftain]] elder son Pomda Gonor of the [[Lemdha]] clan, of the Phomda Tsang line.&lt;ref name="Pachen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pachen|last2=Donnelley|first2=Adelaide|title=Sorrow Mountain: The Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun|date=2000|publisher=Kodansha International|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pachen took [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge in the Dharma]] when she was 8 years old and was subsequently initiated into the deity practice of [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Vajrakilaya Dorje Phurba], a [[Nyingma]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Cleland |first=Elizabeth Christine |date=2001 |title=The Vajrakilaya Sadhana: An Euro-American experience of a Nyingma ritual |type=M.A. |publisher=Carleton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was 17, she discovered her father's plans to marry her off and attempted to run away to Gyalsay Rinpoche's monastery at Tromkhog. However, she returned after a few days of traveling with her father's promise to annul the engagement.

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] and the [[PRC]] officially signed the [[Seventeen Point Agreement]] in 1951. Increasing tensions led her father to train her in the use of firearms and begin organizing militant resistance.&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt;

For the next few years, Pachen sat in on her father's administrative meetings with local chieftains. In 1954, Pachen and her mother spent 6 months in Gyalsay Rinpoche's monastery, during which she completed [[Ngondro]], or preliminary religious training. She returned at the request of her father, who wanted to officially teach her the duties involved with being the heir to a chieftain.&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt;

==Rebellion==
By the end of 1956, tens of thousands of armed Khampas had taken to the surrounding hills in armed resistance. When her father died in 1958, she assumed her role as chieftainess of the Lemdha clan. In 1959, she rode at the head of their 600 resistance fighters into the nearby hills. Her clan joined with others from [[Derge]] and Lingkha Shipa.&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt;

After news of eminent Chinese attack, Pachen returned to Lemdha to warn her family and gather their valuables. Their group grew to thousands as families from the towns of [[Derge]], Lingkha Shipa and [[Markam County|Markham]] fled with the ultimate plan of joining [[Chushi Gangdruk]], the principal resistance group centered in [[Lhasa]] at the time. After rejoining the earlier Lemdha resistance fighters, Pachen aided in dividing the refugees into smaller, less visible groups, organized and dispatched defensive patrols, and actively engaged in armed warfare.&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt; During this migration, her group was aided by [[CIA Tibetan program|CIA paramilitary support]].

Their camp was attacked by overwhelming Chinese forces in the area around the Pelbar village in [[Tingri County]] in late 1959, shortly after they heard of [[Chushi Gangdruk]]'s defeat. Pachen, her mother, aunt, and grandmother took refuge in a nearby forest. They successfully traveled towards India for the next 25 days, until they were captured by Chinese forces along with around 300 other refugees.&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt;

==Imprisonment==
Immediately after being captured, Pachen and her family were held in nearby abandoned houses that served as temporary prisons. Over the course of a week, Pachen was interrogated and beaten. Soon after, many of the women, children and elderly people were released (including her mother, aunt, and grandmother), and Pachen was transferred to a 'collection center' in Lhodzong, where she was held for a month. She reported being the only woman held there.&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt;

After that, Pachen was transferred to a monastery in [[Chamdo]] that was being used as a Chinese prison. For the next 10 months, she was regularly questioned, until she was transferred to another part of the monastery known as Deyong Nang, where she was further questioned and was forced to wear [[leg irons]] for over a year. She was held there from 1961 to 1963.&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt;

In 1963, she was moved to Silthog Thang, a prison 'where those...considered guilty of the most serious crimes were sent,'&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt; located between the [[Mekong]] (known as the Zachu river in Tibet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=Thomas M.|title=Encyclopedia of the Developing World|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|page=1548}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Ngomchu river (a tributary of the Mekong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chellaney|first1=Brahma|title=Water: Asia's New Battleground|date=25 July 2013|publisher=Georgetown University Press|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;). At Silthog Thang, she was sectioned according to gender and level of devotion. She was also held in isolation for 9 months after refusing to denounce her religion and rebuking an officer.&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt;

After hearing that her mother was living and working in [[Kongpo]] and that a number of prisoners were being sent there, Pachen convinced the prison officers to transfer her as well. She spent a year there and was transferred to [[Drapchi prison]], one of the most notorious Chinese prisons, in 1965. She was held there for 11 years. At Drapchi, she reported that prisoners were forced to wear a Chinese uniform and were forbidden to speak Tibetan, pray, or practice Tibetan customs.&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt;

After [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, Pachen was transferred to the 5th division of Tramo Dzong in Kongpo [[Nyingtri]]. She was released in 1981, after being imprisoned for 21 years. She was 48 years old.&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt;

==Release==
After her release from [[prison]] in January 1981, Pachen went on a pilgrimage. She visited the monasteries of [[Sera Monastery|Sera]], [[Drepung Monastery|Drepung]], and [[Ganden Monastery|Ganden]], which had all been destroyed in the [[Cultural Revolution]], during her imprisonment. Over the course of the next year, she visited monasteries in [[Lhokha]], Shedra, [[Nyetang|Drolma Lhakhang]], Dhalakhampo, and stayed for eight months in the [[Samye monastery]]. There, she learned the Buddhist practice Chud len, or Essence Extraction, and the [[Chöd]] practice, before deciding to return to Lhasa to continue support for the cause of Tibetan independence.&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt;

She advertised and participated in three [[1987-89 Tibetan unrest|notable demonstrations]] before fleeing to India; the September 27 and October 1 demonstrations of 1987 and the March 5 demonstration of 1988. In 1989, she discovered that she was to be arrested again and made plans to escape to [[Nepal]] over [[Mount Kailash]]. After 25 days, she was airlifted to [[Dharamshala]]. Her dream to meet the [[Dalai Lama]] came true when she was granted a personal audience soon after her arrival. She settled in the [[Gaden Choeling Nunnery]] in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala, India]].&lt;ref name="Pachen"/&gt;

==Autobiography==
Ani Pachen's autobiography, ''Sorrow Mountain: the Journey of a Tibetan Warrior Nun'',  was [[published]] in 2000, and she toured the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. In 2001, she visited the [[United Kingdom]] at the invitation of the [[Tibet Society]], and led the annual march through central [[London]] to commemorate the [[1959 Tibetan uprising|Lhasa Uprising]].

==Death==
Ani Pachen died in Dharamsala on February 2, 2002 of heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Douglas|title=Ani Pachen, Warrior Nun in Tibet 21 Years, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/18/world/ani-pachen-warrior-nun-in-tibet-jail-21-years-dies.html|publisher=New York Times|date=18 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8300">[[File:Arch Sculpt - CA 09.jpg|thumb|350px|right|sculpted [[pediment]]]]'''Architectural sculpture''' is the use of [[sculpture|sculptural]] techniques by an [[architect]] and/or [[sculptor]] in the design of a building, [[bridge]], [[mausoleum]] or other such project. The sculpture is usually integrated with the structure, but freestanding works that are part of the original design are also considered to be architectural sculpture.

It has also been defined as, ''an integral part of a building or sculpture created especially to decorate or embellish an architectural structure.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selectartusa.com/gloss.htm|title=Select Art Sculpture: Glossary|work=selectartusa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural sculpture has been employed by builders throughout history, and in virtually every continent on earth save pre-colonial Australia.

==Egyptian==
{{main article|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}
[[File:LuxTempleObelisk.JPG|left|200px|thumb|[[Luxor Obelisk]]]]
Modern understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on the religious monuments that have survived since antiquity, which are carved stone with post-and-lintel construction. These religious monuments dedicated to the gods or [[pharaoh]]s were designed with a great deal of architectural sculpture inside and out:  engaged statues, carved columns and pillars, and wall surfaces carved with bas-reliefs. The classic examples of Egyptian colossal monuments (the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], the [[Abu Simbel temples]], the [[Karnak]] Temple Complex, etc.) represent thoroughly integrated combinations of architecture and sculpture.

Obelisks, elaborately carved from a single block of stone, were usually placed in pairs to flank the entrances to temples and pyramids. Reliefs are also common in Egyptian building, depicting scenes of everyday life and often accompanied by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]].

==Assyro-Babylonian==
[[File:Ashurnasipal with official.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Ashurnasipal with officials]]
The [[Fertile Crescent]] architectural sculptural tradition began when [[Ashurnasirpal II]] moved his capitol to the city of [[Nimrud]] around 879 BCE.  This site was located near a major deposit of gypsum ([[alabaster]]).  This fairly easy to cut stone could be quarried in large blocks that allowed them to be easily carved for the palaces that were built there.  The early style developed out of an already flourishing mural tradition by creating drawings that were then carved in low relief.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Julian, ''Assyrian Sculpture'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts,  1983 pp. 17-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Another contributing factor in the development of architectural sculpture were the small carved seals that had been made in the area for centuries.

Classical Greek architecture, like the prototypical [[Parthenon]], incorporate architectural sculpture in a fairly narrow set of standard, formal building elements.  The names of these elements still comprise the usual vocabulary for discussion:  the [[pediment]], the [[Metope (architecture)|metope]], the [[frieze]], the [[caryatid]], the [[quadriga]], [[acroteria]], etc.

Greek examples of architectural sculpture are distinguished not only by their age but their very high quality and skillful technique, with rhythmic and dynamic modeling, figural compositions in friezes that continue seamlessly over vertical joints from one block of stone to the next, and mastery of depth and legibility.

The known Greek and Roman examples have been exhaustively studied, and frequently copied or adapted into subsequent neo-classical styles:  [[Greek Revival architecture]], usually the most strict; [[Neoclassical architecture]]; [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] with its exaggerated and romantic free interpretations of the vocabulary, and even Stalinist neo-classical architecture like the [[Central Moscow Hippodrome]] adapted to a totalitarian aesthetic.  These re-interpretations are sometimes dubious, for instance, there are many modern copies of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], like the [[National Diet Building]] in Tokyo, despite the fact that all classical descriptions of the Mausoleum are vague.

[[File:Pediment, Philly Art Museum (3).jpg|right|250px|thumb|pediment sculpture detail, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], sculptor [[C. Paul Jennewein]], 1933]]

Not until about 1870 did the U.S. develop the talent, the economic power, and the taste for buildings grand enough to need architectural sculpture.  The [[Philadelphia City Hall]], constructed 1871 through 1901, is recognized as the turning point,&lt;ref&gt;Gurney, George, Sculpture of a City—Philadelphia's Treasures in Bronze and Stone, Fairmount Park Association, Walker Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; because of the approximately 250 sculptures planned for the building, the large [[finial]] of [[William Penn]], and the practical effect of [[Alexander Milne Calder]] training many assistants there.

In the same years, [[H.H. Richardson]] began to develop his influential signature genre, which included romantic, medieval, and Romanesque stone carving.  [[Richard Morris Hunt]] became the first to bring the Parisian neo-classical [[École des Beaux-Arts]] style back to the United States, a style that depended on integrated figural sculpture and a highly ornamented building fabric for its aesthetic effect.  The Beaux-Arts style dominated for major public buildings between the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, through about 1912, the year of the [[San Francisco City Hall]].  The need for sculptors saw the emergence of a small industry of carvers and modelers, and a professional organization, the [[National Sculpture Society]].

The advent of steel frames and reinforced concrete encouraged, at first, more diverse building styles into the 1910s and 1920s.  The diversity of skyscraper Gothic, exotic "revivals" of Mayan and Egyptian, [[Stripped Classicism]], [[Art Deco]], etc. called for a similar diversity of sculptural approaches.  The use of sculpture was still expected, particularly for public buildings such as war memorials and museums.  In 1926 the pre-eminent American architectural sculptor, [[Lee Lawrie]], with his longtime friend and collaborator architect [[Bertram Goodhue]], developed perhaps the most sophisticated American examples at the [[Nebraska State Capitol]] and the [[Los Angeles Public Library]].

Goodhue's premature death ended that collaboration.  The [[Great Depression|Depression]], and the onset of World War II, decimated building activity.  The old building trades disbanded.  By the postwar years the aesthetic of architectural modernism had taken hold.  Except for a few diehards and regional sculptors, the profession was not only dead but discredited.  As of 2010 there are isolated signs of a revival of interest, for instance in the career of [[Raymond Kaskey]].

}}

'''Atâ-Malek Juvayni''' (1226&amp;ndash;1283) ({{lang-fa|عطاملک جوینی}}), in full, Ala al-Din Ata-ullah ({{lang-fa|علاءالدین عطاءالله}}),  was a [[Persian people|Persian]] historian who wrote an account of the [[Mongol Empire]] entitled ''[[Tarikh-i Jahangushay-i Juvaini|Tarīkh-i Jahān-gushā]]'' (''History of the World Conqueror'').

He was born in Juvayn, a city in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in eastern [[Persia]]. Both his grandfather and his father, Baha al-Din, had held the post of ''sahib-divan'' or Minister of Finance for [[Mingburnu|Muhammad Jalal al-Din]] and [[Ögedei Khan]] respectively. Baha al-Din also acted as deputy c. 1246 for his immediate superior, the emir Arghun&lt;!-- This is not Arghun Khan but someone else. --&gt;, in which role he oversaw a large area including [[Kingdom of Georgia]].

Juvayni too became an important official of the empire. He visited the Mongol capital of [[Karakorum]] twice, beginning his history of the Mongols conquests on one such visit (c. 1252-53). He was with [[Hulagu Khan|Ilkhan Hulagu]] in 1256 at the taking of [[Alamut]] and was responsible for saving part of its celebrated library. He had also accompanied Hulagu during the [[sack of Baghdad]]  in 1258, and the next year was appointed governor of [[Baghdad]], Lower [[Mesopotamia]], and [[Khuzistan]]. Around 1282, Juvayni attended a Mongol ''[[Kurultai|quriltai]],'' or assembly, held in the Ala-Taq pastures northeast of [[Lake Van]]. He died the following year in [[Mughan]] or [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]] in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]].

Juvayni's brother was the powerful [[Shams al-Din Juvayni|Shams al-Din Mohammad Sahib-Divan]], who had served as Minister of Finance under Hulagu and [[Abaqa Khan]]. A skillful leader in his own right, Shams al-Din also had influential in-laws: his wife Khoshak was the daughter of [[Avag Mkhargrdzeli]], [[Amirspasalar|Lord High Constable]] of Georgia, and [[Gvantsa Kakhaberidze|Gvantsa]], a noblewoman who went on to become [[List of monarchs of Georgia|queen of Georgia]].

Juvayni's own position at court and his family connections made him privy to information unavailable to other historians. For unknown reasons Juvayni's history terminates in 1260, more than twenty years before his death.

The standard edition of Juvayni's history is published under the title ''Tarīkh-i Jahān-gushā'', ed. [[Mohammad Ghazvini|Mirza Muhammad Qazwini]], 3 vol, Gibb Memorial Series 16 (Leiden and London, 1912–37). An English translation by John Andrew Boyle ''The History of the World-Conqueror'' was republished in 1997.

'''Babylon''' was a key [[Realm|kingdom]] in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] from the 18th to 6th centuries BC. The city was built on the [[Euphrates]] river and divided in equal parts along its left and right banks, with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods. Babylon was originally a small Akkadian town dating from the period of the [[Akkadian Empire]] {{circa|2300 BC}}.

The town became part of a small independent [[city-state]] with the rise of the [[First Babylonian dynasty]] in the 19th century BC. After the Amorite king [[Hammurabi]] created a short-lived empire in the 18th century BC, he built Babylon up into a major city and declared himself its king, and southern Mesopotamia became known as [[Babylonia]] and Babylon eclipsed [[Nippur]] as its holy city. The empire waned under Hammurabi's son [[Samsu-iluna]] and Babylon spent long periods under [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Kassites|Kassite]] and [[Elam]]ite domination. After being destroyed and then rebuilt by the Assyrians, Babylon became the capital of the short lived [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] from 609 to 539&amp;nbsp;BC. The [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], although a number of scholars believe these were actually in the Assyrian capital of [[Nineveh]]. After the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the city came under the rule of the [[Achaemenid]], [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] empires.

It has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world {{circa|1770|1670&amp;nbsp;BC}}, and again {{circa|612|320&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=no}}. It was perhaps the first city to reach a population above 200,000.&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;Tertius Chandler.

The remains of the city are in present-day [[Hillah]], [[Babil Governorate]], [[Iraq]], about {{convert|85|km}} south of [[Baghdad]], comprising a large [[tell (archaeology)|tell]] of broken mud-brick buildings and debris.

The main sources of information about Babylon—excavation of the site itself, references in [[cuneiform]] texts found elsewhere in Mesopotamia, references in the [[Bible]], descriptions in classical writing (especially by [[Herodotus]]), and second-hand descriptions (citing the work of [[Ctesias]] and [[Berossus]])—present an incomplete and sometimes contradictory picture of the ancient city even at its peak in the sixth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour (2006), pp. 140–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Etymology}}

==Name==
The English ''Babylon'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''Babylṓn'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|Βαβυλών}}}}), a transliteration of the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''{{transl|akk|Bābilim}}'' ([[cuneiform]]: {{cuneiform|{{lang|akk|{{linktext|𒆍𒀭𒊏𒆠}}}}}} KA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.DIG̃IR.RA&lt;sup&gt;KI&lt;/sup&gt;).{{sfn|Sayce|1878|p=182}}{{failed verification|date=February 2018}}

[[Archibald Sayce]], writing in the 1870s, considered ''Bab-ilu'' or ''Bab-ili'' to be the translation of an earlier [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] (formerly thought to be in the obsolete "[[Turanian languages|Turanian]]" language-family) name ''Ca-dimirra'', meaning "gate of god",&lt;ref&gt;[[Archibald Henry Sayce]], "The Origin of Semitic Civilisation, Chiefly Upon Philological Evidence", ''Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology'' Vol. 1, p. [https://archive.org/stream/transactionssoc07nashgoog#page/n324/mode/2up 298]; read 2 April 1872.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayce1878p182&gt;{{cite EB9 |last=Sayce |first=Archibald Henry |authorlink=Archibald Henry Sayce |year=1878b |wstitle=Babylon–Babylonia |volume=III |pages=182–|short=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the characters KAN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; DIĜIR.RA&lt;sup&gt;KI&lt;/sup&gt; (corresponding to the Sumerian phrase ''kan diĝirak'' "god's gate") or perhaps based on other characters.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. A. Wallis Budge|Ernest A. Budge]], ''The history of Esarhaddon (son of Sennacherib) king of Assyria, B.C. 681–688''; London: Trübner &amp; Co., 1880; pp. [https://archive.org/stream/historyofesarhad00esarrich#page/134/mode/2up 135]–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor [[Dietz-Otto Edzard]], the city was originally called ''{{transl|akk|Babilla}}'', but by the time of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], through a process of etymological speculation, had become  ''{{transl|akk|Bāb-ili(m)}}'' meaning "gate of god" or "god's gate"&lt;ref&gt;Dietz Otto Edzard: ''Geschichte Mesopotamiens. Von den Sumerern bis zu Alexander dem Großen'', Beck, München 2004, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Bab-[[El (deity)|Il]]''). The "gate of god" translation is increasingly viewed as a [[folk etymology]] to explain an unknown original non-Semitic placename.&lt;ref&gt;Liane Jakob-Rost, Joachim Marzahn: ''Babylon'', ed. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. Vorderasiatisches Museum, (Kleine Schriften&amp;nbsp;4), 2.&amp;nbsp;Auflage, Putbus 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Ignace Gelb|I.J. Gelb]] suggested in 1955 that ''Babil/Babilla'' is the basis of the city name, of unknown meaning and origin, as there were other similarly-named places in [[Sumer]], and there are no other examples of Sumerian place-names being replaced with Akkadian translations. He deduced that it later transformed into Akkadian ''{{transl|akk|Bāb-ili(m)}}'', and that the Sumerian ''Ka-dig̃irra'' was a later translation of that, rather than vice versa.&lt;ref name="Gelb 1955"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31239619 |title=I studied inscriptions from before the flood : ancient Near Eastern, literary, and linguistic approaches to Genesis 1-11 |last=Gelb |first=I.

In the [[Bible]], the name appears as ''Babel'' ({{lang-he|[[:wikt:בבל|בָּבֶל]]}} ''Bavel'', &lt;small&gt;[[Tiberian vocalization|Tib.]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|he|בָּבֶל}} ''Bāḇel''; {{lang-syc|ܒܒܠ}} ''Bāwēl'', {{lang-arc|בבל}} ''Babel''; in {{lang-ar|بَابِل}} ''Bābil''), interpreted in the [[Hebrew Scriptures]]' [[Book of Genesis]] to mean "[[confusion of tongues|confusion]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Gen.|11:9|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the verb ''bilbél'' ({{lang|he|[[:wikt:בלבל|בלבל]]}}, "to confuse").&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Magnusson, ''BC: The Archaeology of the Bible Lands''. BBC Publications 1977, pp. 198–199.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern English verb, ''{{lang|en|to babble}}'' ("to speak meaningless words"), is popularly thought to derive from this name, but there is no direct connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=babble|title=Online Etymology Dictionary – ''babble''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient records in some situations use "Babylon" as a name for other cities, including cities like [[Borsippa]] within Babylon's sphere of influence, and [[Nineveh]] for a short period after the Assyrian sack of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley]], "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4200384 Nineveh, Babylon and the Hanging Gardens: Cuneiform and Classical Sources Reconciled]"; ''Iraq'' 56, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalley2005 /&gt;

[[File:Babylon, 1932.jpg|thumb|right|Babylon in 1932]]
[[File:Ancient Remains in Babylon.jpg|thumb|Brick structures in Babylon, photographed in 2016]]
The remains of the city are in present-day Hillah,&lt;ref name="Sayce1878p182"/&gt; Babil Governorate, Iraq, about {{convert|85|km|sp=us}} south of Baghdad, comprising a large [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] of broken mud-brick buildings and debris. The site at Babylon consists of a number of mounds covering an area of about {{convert|2|x|1|km|sp=us}}, oriented north to south,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} along the [[Euphrates]] to the west. Originally, the river roughly bisected the city, but the course of the river has since shifted so that most of the remains of the former western part of the city are now inundated. Some portions of the city wall to the west of the river also remain.

Only a small portion of the ancient city (3% of the area within the inner walls; 1.5% of the area within the outer walls; 0.1% at the depth of Middle and Old Babylon) has been excavated.&lt;ref name=OP2011 /&gt; Known remains include:
* Kasr&amp;nbsp;– also called Palace or Castle, it is the location of the [[Neo-Babylonian]] ziggurat [[Etemenanki]] and lies in the center of the site.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* Amran Ibn Ali&amp;nbsp;– the highest of the mounds at 25&amp;nbsp;meters, to the south. It is the site of [[Esagila]], a temple of [[Marduk]] which also contained shrines to [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]] and [[Nabu]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* Homera&amp;nbsp;– a reddish-colored mound on the west side. Most of the [[Hellenistic]] remains are here.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* Babil&amp;nbsp;– a mound about 22&amp;nbsp;meters high at the northern end of the site. Its bricks have been subject to looting since ancient times. It held a palace built by Nebuchadnezzar.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Archaeologists have recovered few artifacts predating the Neo-Babylonian period. The water table in the region has risen greatly over the centuries, and artifacts from the time before the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] are unavailable to current standard archaeological methods. Additionally, the Neo-Babylonians conducted significant rebuilding projects in the city, which destroyed or obscured much of the earlier record. Babylon was pillaged numerous times after revolting against foreign rule, most notably by the [[Hittites]] and [[Elamites]] in the 2nd millennium, then by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 1st millennium. Much of the western half of the city is now beneath the river, and other parts of the site have been mined for commercial building materials.

Only the Koldewey expedition recovered artifacts from the Old Babylonian period. These included 967 clay tablets, stored in private houses, with Sumerian literature and lexical documents.&lt;ref name=OP2011 /&gt;

Nearby ancient settlements are [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Borsippa]], [[Dilbat]], and [[Kutha]]. [[Marad]] and [[Sippar]] were 60&amp;nbsp;km in either direction along the Euphrates.&lt;ref name=OP2011 /&gt;

Historical knowledge of early Babylon must be pieced together from epigraphic remains found elsewhere, such as at [[Uruk]], [[Nippur]], and [[Haradum]].

Information on the Neo-Babylonian city is available from archaeological excavations and from classical sources. Babylon was described, perhaps even visited, by a number of classical historians including [[Ctesias]], [[Herodotus]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]], [[Strabo]], and [[Cleitarchus]]. These reports are of variable accuracy and some of the content was politically motivated, but these still provide useful information.&lt;ref name=MacGinnis&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacGinnis |first=John |last2= |first2= |date=1986 |title=Herodotus' Description of Babylon |url=https://www.academia.edu/10243265/Herodotus_Description_of_Babylon |journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies |publisher= |volume=33 |issue= |pages=67–86 |doi= |access-date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early references ===

References to the city of Babylon can be found in Akkadian and Sumerian literature from the late third millennium BC. One of the earliest is a tablet describing the Akkadian king Šar-kali-šarri laying the foundations in Babylon of new temples for Annūnı̄tum and Ilaba. Babylon also appears in the administrative records of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], which collected in-kind tax payments and appointed an ''[[Ensí|ensi]]'' as local governor.&lt;ref name=Lambert2011&gt;Wilfred G. Lambert, "Babylon: Origins"; in Cancik-Kirschbaum et al. (2011), pp. 71–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vedeler (2006), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called [[Babylonian Chronicles#Provenanced Chronicles|Weidner Chronicle]] (also known as ''ABC 19'') states that [[Sargon of Akkad]] ({{circa|23d century BC}} in the [[short chronology]]) had built Babylon "in front of Akkad" (ABC 19:51). A later chronicle states that Sargon "dug up the dirt of the pit of Babylon, and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Akkad". (ABC 20:18–19). Van de Mieroop has suggested that those sources may refer to the much later Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] rather than Sargon of Akkad.&lt;ref name=Dalley2005&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley]], Babylon as a Name for other Cities Including Nineveh, in [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc62.pdf Proceedings of the 51st Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale], Oriental Institute SAOC 62, pp. 25–33, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical dating===

[[Ctesias]], quoted by [[Diodorus Siculus]] and in [[George Syncellus]]'s ''Chronographia'', claimed to have access to manuscripts from Babylonian archives, which date the founding of Babylon to 2286&amp;nbsp;BC, under the reign of its first king, [[Belus (Babylonian)|Belus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Records of the Past'', [[Archibald Sayce]], 2nd series, Vol. 1, 1888, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar figure is found in the writings of [[Berossus]], who according to Pliny,&lt;ref&gt;N.H. vii. 57&lt;/ref&gt; stated that astronomical observations commenced at Babylon 490&amp;nbsp;years before the Greek era of [[Phoroneus]], indicating 2243&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] wrote that Babylon was built 1002&amp;nbsp;years before the date given by [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]] for the siege of Troy (1229&amp;nbsp;BC), which would date Babylon's foundation to 2231&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;''The Seven Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World'', [[George Rawlinson]], Vol. 4, p. 526–527.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these dates place Babylon's foundation in the [[23rd century BC]]; however, cuneiform records have not been found to correspond with these classical (post-cuneiform) accounts.

==History==
[[File:Queen of the Night (Babylon).jpg|thumb|The [[Burney Relief|Queen of the Night]] relief. The figure could be an aspect of the goddess [[Ishtar]], Babylonian goddess of sex and love.]]

By around the [[19th century BC]], much of southern Mesopotamia was occupied by [[Amorites]], nomadic tribes from the northern [[Levant]] who were [[Northwest Semitic]] speakers, unlike the native [[Akkadians]] of southern Mesopotamia and [[Assyria]], who spoke [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]]. The Amorites at first did not practice agriculture like more advanced Mesopotamians, preferring a semi-nomadic lifestyle, herding sheep. Over time, Amorite grain merchants rose to prominence and established their own independent dynasties in several south Mesopotamian city-states, most notably [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Eshnunna]], [[Lagash]], and later, founding Babylon as a state.

===Old Babylonian period===

According to a Babylonian date list, [[Amorite]]{{efn|The Amorites were not native to Mesopotamia, but were semi-nomadic [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] [[Northwest Semitic]] invaders from the northern [[Levant]]. They (together with the [[Elamites]] to the east) had originally been prevented from taking control of the Akkadian states of southern Mesopotamia by the intervention of powerful [[Assyria]]n kings of the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] during the 21st and 20th centuries BC, intervening from northern Mesopotamia. However, when the Assyrians turned their attention to expanding their colonies in [[Asia Minor]], the Amorites eventually began to supplant native rulers across the region.}} rule in Babylon began ({{circa|19th or 18th century BC}}) with a chieftain named [[Sumu-abum]], who declared independence from the neighboring city-state of [[Kazallu]]. [[Sumu-la-El]], whose dates may be concurrent with those of Sumu-abum, is usually given as the progenitor of the [[First Babylonian Dynasty]]. Both are credited with building the walls of Babylon. In any case, the records describe Sumu-la-El's military successes establishing a regional sphere of influence for Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;Vedeler (2006), pp. 8–15. "However, this later tradition is almost certainly a simplification or even a reworking of the actual events surrounding Sumu-abum, who was never regarded as an actual ancestor to the other kings of the Babylon I dynasty (Edzard 1957:122); in reality the relationship of Sumu-abum to Babylon was much more complex. It was long been noted that many of Sumu-abum's year names are identical or virtually identical to the year names of Sumu-la-el, whom we know for certain was king of Babylon. Goddeeris (2002:319–320) sums these parallels up as follows: Sa 1 and 2 / Sl 5 and 6: building the wall of Babylon. Sa 9 / Sl 'b': building the wall of Dilbat. Sa 13/14 / Sl 20/21: the destruction and seizure of Kazallu."&lt;/ref&gt;

Babylon was initially a minor city-state, and controlled little surrounding territory; its first four Amorite rulers did not assume the title of king. The older and more powerful states of [[Assyria]], [[Elam]], [[Isin]], and [[Larsa]] overshadowed Babylon until it became the capital of [[Hammurabi]]'s short lived empire about a century later. Hammurabi (r. 1792–1750&amp;nbsp;BC) is famous for codifying the laws of Babylonia into the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]''. He conquered all of the cities and city states of southern Mesopotamia, including [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Ur]], [[Uruk]], [[Nippur]], [[Lagash]], [[Eridu]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]], [[Eshnunna]], [[Akshak]], [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], [[Shuruppak]], [[Bad-tibira]], [[Sippar]], and [[Girsu]], coalescing them into one kingdom, ruled from Babylon. Hammurabi also invaded and conquered [[Elam]] to the east, and the kingdoms of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and [[Ebla]] to the northwest. After a protracted struggle with the powerful Assyrian king [[Ishme-Dagan]] of the [[Old Assyrian Empire]], he forced his successor to pay tribute late in his reign, spreading Babylonian power to Assyria's [[Hattians|Hattian]] and [[Hurrian]] colonies in [[Asia Minor]].

After the reign of Hammurabi, the whole of southern Mesopotamia came to be known as [[Babylonia]], whereas the north had already coalesced centuries before into [[Assyria]]. From this time, Babylon supplanted [[Nippur]] and [[Eridu]] as the major religious centers of southern Mesopotamia. Hammurabi's empire destabilized after his death. Assyrians defeated and drove out the Babylonians and Amorites. The far south of Mesopotamia broke away, forming the native [[Sealand Dynasty]], and the Elamites appropriated territory in eastern Mesopotamia. The Amorite dynasty remained in power in Babylon, which again became a small city state.

Texts from Old Babylon often include references to [[Shamash]], the sun-god of Sippar, treated as a supreme deity, and [[Marduk]], considered as his son. Marduk was later elevated to a higher status and Shamash lowered, perhaps reflecting Babylon's rising political power&lt;ref name=Lambert2011 /&gt;

=== Middle Babylon ===

In 1595&amp;nbsp;BC{{efn|Please see [[Chronology of the ancient Near East]] for more discussion on dating events in the [[2nd millennium BC]], including the Sack of Babylon.}} the city was overthrown by the [[Hittite Empire]] from [[Asia Minor]]. Thereafter, [[Kassites]] from the [[Zagros Mountains]] of north western [[Ancient Iran]] captured Babylon, ushering in a dynasty that lasted for 435&amp;nbsp;years, until 1160&amp;nbsp;BC. The city was renamed Karanduniash during this period. Kassite Babylon eventually became subject to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1053 BC) to the north, and [[Elam]] to the east, with both powers vying for control of the city. The Assyrian king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] took the throne of Babylon in 1235&amp;nbsp;BC.

By 1155&amp;nbsp;BC, after continued attacks and annexing of territory by the Assyrians and Elamites, the Kassites were deposed in Babylon. An Akkadian south Mesopotamian dynasty then ruled for the first time. However, Babylon remained weak and subject to domination by Assyria. Its ineffectual native kings were unable to prevent new waves of foreign West Semitic settlers from the deserts of the Levant, including the [[Arameans]] and [[Suteans]] in the 11th century BC, and finally the [[Chaldea]]ns in the 9th century BC, entering and appropriating areas of Babylonia for themselves. The Arameans briefly ruled in Babylon during the late 11th century BC.

===Assyrian period===
[[File:Sennacherib.jpg|thumb|Sennacherib of Assyria during his [[Battle of Halule|Babylonian war]], relief from his palace in Nineveh]]
During the rule of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–609&amp;nbsp;BC), Babylonia was under constant [[Assyria]]n domination or direct control.
During the reign of [[Sennacherib]] of Assyria, Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt, led by a chieftain  named [[Marduk-apla-iddina II|Merodach-Baladan]], in alliance with the [[Elamites]], and suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon. In 689&amp;nbsp;BC, its walls, temples and palaces were razed, and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu, the sea bordering the earlier Babylon on the south. Destruction of the religious center shocked many, and the subsequent murder of Sennacherib by two of his own sons while praying to the god [[Nisroch]] was considered an act of atonement. Consequently, his successor [[Esarhaddon]] hastened to rebuild the old city and make it his residence during part of the year. After his death, Babylonia was governed by his elder son, the [[Assyria]]n prince [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], who eventually started a civil war in 652&amp;nbsp;BC against his own brother, [[Ashurbanipal]], who ruled in [[Nineveh]]. Shamash-shum-ukin enlisted the help of other peoples subject to Assyria, including [[Elam]], [[Persia]], [[Chaldea]]ns, and [[Suteans]] of southern Mesopotamia, and the [[Canaanites]] and [[Arabs]] dwelling in the deserts south of [[Mesopotamia]].

Once again, Babylon was besieged by the Assyrians, starved into surrender and its allies were defeated. Ashurbanipal celebrated a "service of reconciliation", but did not venture to "take the hands" of [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]]. An Assyrian governor named [[Kandalanu]] was appointed as ruler of the city. Ashurbanipal did collect texts from Babylon for inclusion in his extensive [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library]] at Ninevah.&lt;ref name=OP2011 /&gt;

After the death of Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian empire destabilized due to a series of internal civil wars throughout the reigns of Assyrian kings [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] and [[Sinsharishkun]]. Eventually Babylon, like many other parts of the near east, took advantage of the anarchy within Assyria to free itself from Assyrian rule. In the subsequent overthrow of the Assyrian Empire by an alliance of peoples, the Babylonians saw another example of divine vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Houtum-Schindler]], "Babylon," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Nabopolassar]], a previously unknown Chaldean chieftain, Babylon escaped Assyrian rule, and in an alliance with [[Cyaxares]], king of the [[Medes]] and [[Persian people|Persians]] together with the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], finally destroyed the Assyrian Empire between 612 BC and 605 BC. Babylon thus became the capital of the Neo-Babylonian (sometimes and possibly erroneously called the [[Chaldea]]n) Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Alfred S. (2001).

With the recovery of Babylonian independence, a new era of architectural activity ensued, particularly during the reign of his son [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] (604–561&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Saggs, H.W.F. (2000). ''Babylonians'', p. 165. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-20222-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nebuchadnezzar ordered the complete reconstruction of the imperial grounds, including the [[Etemenanki]] [[ziggurat]], and the construction of the [[Ishtar Gate]]—the most prominent of eight gates around Babylon. A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate is located in the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]].

Nebuchadnezzar is also credited with the construction of the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]]—one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]—said to have been built for his homesick wife [[Amyitis]]. Whether the gardens actually existed is a matter of dispute. German archaeologist [[Robert Koldewey]] speculated that he had discovered its foundations, but many historians disagree about the location. [[Stephanie Dalley]] has argued that the hanging gardens were actually located in the Assyrian capital, [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley]], (2013) ''The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive World Wonder traced,'' OUP {{ISBN|978-0-19-966226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nebuchandnezzar is also notoriously associated with the [[Babylonian exile]] of the Jews, the result of an imperial technique of pacification, used also by the Assyrians, in which ethnic groups in conquered areas were [[Resettlement policy of the Neo-Assyrian Empire|deported en masse]] to the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour (2006), pp. 88–89. "Preventing uprisings on the fringes of the empire was a major concern for Assyrian kings, and a number of policies developed to meet this need, among them mass deportations. When new territory was conquered or a rebellious vassal crushed, an increased imperial presence in the trouble spot was often complemented by the removal of large numbers of the indigenous population to the imperial core, effectively breaking up the rebellious population and reducing the potential for future resistance. This practice was effective, and continued throughout the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires until 539 BC and Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The majority of the immigrant population were not slaves (Yamauchi 2002: 365), and some did rise to high status positions at the core of the empire (a possibility reflected in the career of the biblical Daniel, who rises to the status of trusted royal confidant)."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian conquest===
In 539&amp;nbsp;BC, the Neo-Babylonian Empire fell to [[Cyrus the Great]], king of [[Persia]], with a military engagement known as the [[Battle of Opis]]. Babylon's walls were considered impenetrable. The only way into the city was through one of its many gates or through the Euphrates River. Metal grates were installed underwater, allowing the river to flow through the city walls while preventing intrusion. The Persians devised a plan to enter the city via the river. During a Babylonian national feast, Cyrus' troops diverted the Euphrates River upstream, allowing Cyrus' soldiers to enter the city through the lowered water. The Persian army conquered the outlying areas of the city while the majority of Babylonians at the city center were unaware of the breach. The account was elaborated upon by [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref name=Herodotus&gt;Herodotus, Book 1, ch. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D178%3Asection%3D1 178]–200; or see "[http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Herobab.html Herodotus' Description of Babylon and the Babylonians]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacGinnis /&gt; and is also mentioned in parts of the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 44:27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; (Herodotus also described a moat, an enormously tall and broad wall cemented with [[bitumen]] and with buildings on top, and a hundred gates to the city. He also writes that the Babylonians wear turbans and perfume and bury their dead in honey, that they practice ritual prostitution, and that three tribes among them [[Piscivore|eat nothing but fish]]. The hundred gates can be considered a reference to [[Homer]], and following the pronouncement of [[Archibald Henry Sayce]] in 1883, Herodotus's account of Babylon has largely been considered to represent Greek folklore rather than an authentic voyage to Babylon. However, recently, Dalley and others have suggested taking Herodotus's account seriously.)&lt;ref name=Herodotus /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seymour (2006), pp. 107–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Xerxes I tomb Babylonian soldier circa 470 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Babylonian soldier in the Achaemenid army, circa 470 BCE, [[Xerxes I]] tomb.]]
According to [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 36 of the [[Hebrew Bible]], Cyrus later issued a decree permitting captive people, including the [[Jews]], to return to their own lands. Text found on the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of this policy, although the interpretation is disputed because the text only identifies Mesopotamian sanctuaries but makes no mention of Jews, Jerusalem, or Judea.

Under Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king [[Darius I]], Babylon became the capital city of the 9th [[Satrapy]] (Babylonia in the south and Athura in the north), as well as a center of learning and scientific advancement. In [[Achaemenid]] Persia, the ancient Babylonian arts of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]] were revitalized, and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations. The city became the administrative capital of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] and remained prominent for over two centuries. Many important archaeological discoveries have been made that can provide a better understanding of that era.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press/statements/cyrus_cylinder.aspx Cyrus Cylinder] ''The British Museum''.

The early Persian kings had attempted to maintain the religious ceremonies of [[Marduk]], but by the reign of [[Darius III]], over-taxation and the strain of numerous wars led to a deterioration of Babylon's main shrines and canals, and the destabilization of the surrounding region. There were numerous attempts at rebellion and in 522&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Nebuchadnezzar III]]), 521&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Nebuchadnezzar IV]]) and 482&amp;nbsp;BC (Bel-shimani and Shamash-eriba) native Babylonian kings briefly regained independence. However these revolts were quickly repressed and Babylon remained under Persian rule for two centuries, until [[Alexander the Great]]'s entry in 331&amp;nbsp;BC.

===Hellenistic period===
[[File:Charles Le Brun - Entry of Alexander into Babylon.JPG|thumb|upright=1.9|"Entry of Alexander into Babylon", a 1665 painting by [[Charles LeBrun]], depicts Alexander the Great's uncontested entry into the city of Babylon, envisioned with pre-existing [[Ancient Greek architecture|Hellenistic architecture]].]]
In October of 331&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Darius III]], the last [[Achaemenid]] king of the Persian Empire, was defeated by the forces of the [[Ancient Macedonians|Ancient Macedonian]] [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ruler [[Alexander the Great]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. A native account of this invasion notes a ruling by Alexander not to enter the homes of its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. |author2=Linda Black |author3=Larry S.

Under Alexander, Babylon again flourished as a center of learning and commerce. However, following Alexander's death in 323&amp;nbsp;BC in the palace of [[Nebuchadnezzar]], his empire was divided amongst his generals, the [[Diadochi]], and [[Wars of the Diadochi|decades of fighting]] soon began. The constant turmoil virtually emptied the city of Babylon. A tablet dated 275&amp;nbsp;BC states that the inhabitants of Babylon were transported to [[Seleucia on the Tigris|Seleucia]], where a palace and a temple ([[Esagila]]) were built. With this deportation, Babylon became insignificant as a city, although more than a century later, sacrifices were still performed in its old sanctuary.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{harvnb|Sayce|1911|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewed Persian rule===
{{Main|Babylonia#Persian_Babylonia}}
Under the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid Empire]]s, Babylon (like Assyria) became a province of these [[Persian Empire]]s for nine centuries, until after AD&amp;nbsp;650. It maintained its own culture and people, who spoke varieties of [[Aramaic]], and who continued to refer to their homeland as Babylon. Examples of their culture are found in the [[Babylonian Talmud]], the [[Gnostic]] [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]] religion, [[East Syrian Rite|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]] and [[Manichaeism|the religion]] of the prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]]. Christianity was introduced to Mesopotamia in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, and Babylon was the seat of a Bishop of the [[Church of the East]] until well after the [[Early Muslim conquests|Arab/Islamic conquest]].

===Muslim conquest===
{{Main|Muslim conquest of Persia}}
In the mid-7th century, Mesopotamia was invaded and settled by the expanding [[Muslim]] Empire, and a period of [[Islamization]] followed. Babylon was dissolved as a province and [[Aramaic]] and [[Church of the East]] Christianity eventually became marginalized. Ibn Hauqal mentions a small village called Babel in the tenth century; subsequent travelers describe only ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour (2006), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babylon is mentioned in medieval Arabic writings as a source of bricks,&lt;ref name=OP2011&gt;Olof Pedersén, "[https://www.degruyter.com/view/books/9783110222128/9783110222128.47/9783110222128.47.xml Excavated and Unexcavated Libraries in Babylon]", in Cancik-Kirschbaum et al. (2011), pp. 47–67.&lt;/ref&gt; said to have been used in cities from Baghdad to Basra.&lt;ref name=Reade2009&gt;Julian E. Reade, "Disappearance and rediscovery"; in Finkel &amp; Seymour, eds., ''Babylon'' (2009); pp. 13–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

European travelers in many cases could not discover the city's location, or mistook [[Fallujah]] for it. Twelfth-century traveler [[Benjamin of Tudela]] mentions Babylon but it is not clear if he really went there. Others referred to [[Baghdad]] as Babylon or New Babylon and described various structures encountered in the region as the Tower of Babel.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour (2006), p. 148–151.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pietro della Valle]] found the ancient site in the seventeenth century and noted the existence of both baked and dried [[mudbrick]]s cemented with [[bitumen]].&lt;ref name=Reade2009 /&gt;

==Modern era==
{{Quote box|From the accounts of modern travellers, I had expected to have found on the site of Babylon more, and less, than I actually did. Less, because I could have formed no conception of the prodigious extent of the whole ruins, or of the size, solidity, and perfect state, of some of the parts of them; and more, because I thought that I should have distinguished some traces, however imperfect, of many of the principle structures of Babylon. I imagined, I should have said: "Here were the walls, and such must have been the extent of the area. There stood the palace, and this most assuredly was the tower of Belus." – I was completely deceived: instead of a few insulated mounds, I found the whole face of the country covered with vestiges of building, in some places consisting of brick walls surprisingly fresh, in others merely of a vast succession of mounds of rubbish of such indeterminate figures, variety and extent, as to involve the person who should have formed any theory in inextricable confusion.|[[Claudius Rich|Claudius J.

The eighteenth century saw an increasing flow of travelers to Babylon, including [[Carsten Niebuhr]] and [[Pierre-Joseph de Beauchamp]], as well as measurements of its latitude. Beauchamp's memoir, published in English translation in 1792, provoked the [[British East India Company]] to direct its agents in Baghdad and Basra to acquire Mesopotamian relics for shipment to London.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour (2006), pp. 169–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet]] and [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]] worked there briefly in 1854. The next excavation was conducted by [[Hormuzd Rassam]] on behalf of the [[British Museum]]. Work began in 1879, continuing until 1882, and was prompted by widespread looting of the site. Using industrial scale digging in search of artifacts, Rassam recovered a large quantity of cuneiform tablets and other finds. The zealous excavation methods, common at the time, caused significant damage to the archaeological context.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hormuzd Rassam]], ''[https://archive.org/download/asshurlandofnimr00rass/asshurlandofnimr00rass.pdf Asshur and the Land of Nimrod: Being an Account of the Discoveries Made in the Ancient Ruins of Nineveh, Asshur, Sepharvaim, Calah, &amp;#91;...&amp;#93;]'', Curts &amp; Jennings, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Reade, Hormuzd Rassam and his discoveries, ''Iraq'', vol. 55, pp. 39–62, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Many tablets had appeared on the market in 1876 before Rassam's excavation began.&lt;ref name=OP2011 /&gt;

A team from the [[Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]] led by [[Robert Koldewey]] conducted the first scientific [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]] at Babylon. The work was conducted daily from 1899 until 1917. Primary efforts of the dig involved the temple of [[Marduk]] and the processional way leading up to it, as well as the city wall.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Koldewey]], ''Das wieder erstehende Babylon, die bisherigen Ergebnisse der deutschen Ausgrabungen, J.C.

Further work by the [[German Archaeological Institute]] was conducted by Heinrich J. Lenzen in 1956 and Hansjörg Schmid in 1962. Lenzen's work dealt primarily with the [[Hellenistic]] theatre, and Schmid focused on the temple ziggurat [[Etemenanki]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansjörg Schmid, Der Tempelturm Etemenanki in Babylon, Zabern, 1995, {{ISBN|3-8053-1610-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional work in 1987–1989 concentrated on the area surrounding the Ishara and [[Ninurta]] temples in the Shu-Anna city-quarter of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;G.

===Iraq government===
The site of Babylon has been a cultural asset to Iraq since the creation of the modern Iraqi government in 1920. Babylonian images periodically appear on Iraqi postcards and stamps. In the 1960s a replica of the Ishtar gate and a reconstruction of Ninmakh temple were built on site.&lt;ref name=Curtis2011 /&gt;

On 14 February 1978, the [[Baathist]] government of Iraq under [[Saddam Hussein]] began the "Archaeological Restoration of Babylon Project": reconstructing features of the ancient city atop its ruins. These features included the Southern Palace of Nebuchandnezzar, with 250 rooms, five courtyards, and a 30-meter entrance arch. The project also reinforced the Processional Way, the [[Lion of Babylon (statue)|Lion of Babylon]], and an amphitheater constructed in the city's Hellenistic era. In 1982 the government minted a set of seven coins displaying iconic features of Babylon.  A [[Babylon International Festival]] was held in September 1987, and annually thereafter until 2002 (excepting 1990 and 1991), to showcase this work. Proposed reconstruction of the Hanging Gardens and the great ziggurat never took place.&lt;ref name=Curtis2009&gt;John Curtis, "The Site of Babylon Today"; in Finkel &amp; Seymour, eds., ''Babylon'' (2009); pp. 213–220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtis2011&gt;John Curtis, "The Present Condition of Babylon"; in Cancik-Kirschbaum et al.

Hussein installed a portrait of himself and Nebuchadnezzar at the entrance to the ruins and inscribed his name on many of the bricks, in imitation of Nebuchadnezzar. One frequent inscription reads: "This was built by Saddam Hussein, son of Nebuchadnezzar, to glorify Iraq". These bricks became sought after as collectors' items after Hussein's downfall.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-04-21/saddam-removed-from-ancient-babylon-brick-by-brick/1840416 Saddam removed from ancient Babylon 'brick by brick']", ''ABC News'' 20 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar projects were conducted at [[Nineveh]], [[Nimrud]], [[Assur]] and [[Hatra]], to demonstrate the magnificence of Arab achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia: Behind the Looting of the Iraq Museum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qfb2_dZSx3MC|author=Lawrence Rothfield|date=1 Aug 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226729435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the 1991 [[Gulf War]] ended, Hussein wanted to build a modern palace called Saddam Hill over some of the old ruins, in the pyramidal style of a [[ziggurat]]. In 2003, he intended the construction of a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] line over Babylon, but plans were halted by the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

Conway]] of the [[I Marine Expeditionary Force]] were criticized for building the military base "Camp Alpha", with a [[helipad]] and other facilities on ancient Babylonian ruins during the [[Iraq War]]. US forces have occupied the site for some time and have caused irreparable damage to the archaeological record. In a report of the [[British Museum]]'s Near East department, Dr. John Curtis described how parts of the archaeological site were levelled to create a landing area for helicopters, and parking lots for heavy vehicles. Curtis wrote of the occupation forces:

{{blockquote|They caused substantial damage to the Ishtar Gate, one of the most famous monuments from antiquity [...] US military vehicles crushed 2,600-year-old brick pavements, archaeological fragments were scattered across the site, more than 12 trenches were driven into ancient deposits and military earth-moving projects contaminated the site for future generations of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4461755.stm | title=History lost in dust of war-torn Iraq | work=BBC News | date=2005-04-25 | accessdate=2013-06-07 | author=Bajjaly, Joanne Farchakh}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Cultural importance==
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 65r 3.png|thumb|Woodcut in 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' depicting the fall of Babylon.]]
[[File:The walls of Babylon and the temple of Bel.png|thumb|"The Walls of Babylon and the Temple of Bel (Or Babel)", by 19th-century illustrator [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]]&amp;nbsp;– influenced by early archaeological investigations.]]

Before modern archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia, the appearance of Babylon was largely a mystery, and typically envisioned by Western artists as a hybrid between ancient Egyptian, classical Greek, and contemporary Ottoman culture.&lt;ref&gt;Liverani 2016, pp. 21–22. "In practice, the solution adopted to visualize cities which were in fact unknown was a mixture of classical (Greek) and Egyptian elements, with long colonnades, even built on more than one level—which will then prove totally foreign to the unfired brick architecture of Mesopotamian cities—and with plenty of obelisks and the odd sphinx. To this mixture is added, often and willingly, something of Ottoman architecture, showing cupolas and minarets, clearly useful in picturing an unchangeable Near East which therefore needed to retain elements of remote antiquity in a modern age."&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Babylon's historical significance as well as references to it in the [[Bible]], the word "Babylon" in various languages has acquired a generic meaning of a large, bustling diverse city. Examples include:
* ''Babylon'' is used in [[reggae]] music as a concept in the [[Rastafari movement#Zion vs. Babylon|Rastafari]] belief system, denoting the materialistic [[capitalist]] world.
* [[Freemasonry]], which has its own versions of biblical legends, classically considered Babylon as its birthplace and a haven for science and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Mackey]], ''History of Freemasonry'' (Vol. 1); New York and London: Masonic History Company, 1898/1906; p. [https://archive.org/stream/MackeyAGTheHistoryOfFreemasonryVol.I1906/Mackey%20A%20G%20-%20The%20History%20of%20Freemasonry%20Vol.%20I%201906#page/n85/mode/2up/search/babylon 61].&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Babylon 5]]''&amp;nbsp;– a [[science fiction]] series about a multi-racial futuristic [[space station]].
* ''[[Babylon A.D.]]'' takes place in New York City, decades in the future.
* [[Babilonas]] ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] name for "Babylon")&amp;nbsp;– a real estate development in [[Lithuania]].

===Biblical narrative===
In {{Bibleref|Genesis|10:10}}, Babel (Babylon) is described as founded by [[Nimrod]] along with [[Uruk]], [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]] and perhaps [[Calneh]]—all of them in [[Shinar]] ("Calneh" is now sometimes translated not as a proper name but as the phrase "all of them"). Another story is given in Genesis 11, which describes a united human race, speaking one language, migrating to Shinar to establish a city and tower—the [[Tower of Babel]]. God halts construction of the tower by scattering humanity across the earth and confusing their communication so they are unable to understand each other in the same language.

Babylon appears throughout the [[Hebrew Bible]], including several prophecies and in descriptions of the destruction of Jerusalem and subsequent [[Babylonian captivity]]. Consequently, in [[Jewish]] tradition, Babylon symbolizes an oppressor against which righteous believers must struggle{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. In [[Christianity]], Babylon symbolizes worldliness and evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gotquestions.org/Babylonian-empire.html|title=What is the significance of the Babylonian Empire in biblical history?|work=GotQuestions.org|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prophecies sometimes symbolically link the kings of Babylon with [[Lucifer]]. Nebuchadnezzar, sometimes conflated with Nabonidus, appears as the foremost ruler in this narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour (2006), pp. 91–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Revelation]] in the [[Christian Bible]] refers to Babylon many centuries after it ceased to be a major political center. The city is personified by the "[[Whore of Babylon]]", riding on a scarlet beast with seven heads and ten horns, and drunk on the blood of the righteous. Some scholars of [[apocalyptic literature]] believe this [[Babylon (New Testament)|New Testament "Babylon"]] to be a [[dysphemism]] for the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Tenney: New Testament Survey, Inter-varsity Press, 1985, pp383&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Badagry''' (traditionally '''Gbagle''') is a coastal town and [[Local Government Areas of Nigeria|local government area]] (LGA) in [[Lagos State]], Nigeria. It is between the city of [[Lagos]] and the border with [[Benin]] at [[Seme Border|Seme]]. As of the preliminary 2006 census results, the municipality had a population of 241,093.&lt;ref&gt;The area is led by a traditional chief, Akran De Wheno Aholu Menu - Toyi 1, who is also the permanent vice-chairman of obas and chiefs in Lagos State. [http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/Connections/Pop2006.pdf Federal Republic of Nigeria Official Gazette], published 15 May 2007, accessed 8 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Badagry is situated on the south-west coast of Nigeria, bordered by the [[Gulf of Guinea]] to the south, it is 43 miles southeast of Lagos and 32 miles west of [[Seme Border|Seme]], a border town in [[Benin Republic]].&lt;ref name="lynn"/&gt; Like Lagos Island, it is on the bank of inland lagoons, a system of creeks, waterways that are navigable to Lagos and [[Porto Novo]]. The distance between the lagoon and the ocean varies along the coast, in Badagry, the distance is about a mile.&lt;ref name="lynn"/&gt; The depth of the lagoon varies according to the season, from highs of 3 meters to lows of a meter. The lagoons have a diverse fish population that includes [[Ethmalosa fimbriata|bonga]], [[Pseudotolithus|croaker]], longfin [[pompano]], tilapia and [[Chrysichthys|catfish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolarinwa|first1=Bamidele|last2=Okeowo|first2=Timothy|title=The Species Composition and Diversity of the Coastal Waters of Badagry, Lagos State, Nigeria - EA Journals|journal=Global Journal of Agricultural Research|date=July 2017|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://www.eajournals.org/journals/global-journal-of-agricultural-research-gjar/vol-5-issue-2-july-2017/species-composition-diversity-coastal-waters-badagry-lagos-state-nigeria/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lagoon consists of [[brackish]] and [[freshwater]] with seasonal variability, west of Badagry, [[Yewa River]] provides water inflow to the lagoon.

==History==

There is a traditional [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] narrative that the first settlement within the area was an [[Awori tribe|Awori]] group originally from [[Ile-Ife]] who lived at a nearby settlement. Robin Law, a scholar on [[History of West Africa|West African history]], notes an origin that sprouted out of a resettlement for displaced peoples of varied ethnic groups mostly [[Ogu people]] and [[Oyo empire|Oyo Yorubas]]. Another source links the people living at a settlement called Gberefu, an island along the coast.&lt;ref name="lynn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Lynn|title=Sea ports and sea power: African maritime cultural landscapes|date=2017|location=Cham|isbn=9783319469850|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the recorded notable events in the history of the town was the acquisition of land by a European trader who was locally known as Yovo Huntokonu. Many sources identify the European to be a Dutch trader called Hendrik Hertogh.&lt;ref name="caro"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Sorensen-Gilmour |first=Caroline|date=1995 |title=Badagry 1784-1863. The Political and Commercial History of a Pre-Colonial Lagoonside Community in South West Nigeria |publisher=University of Stirling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huntokonu, who came from the west, settled in the town because he was fleeing the wrath of an African chief. He reached the settlement called Apa under the [[Oba (ruler)|Obaship]] of Alapa and he was given a farmland to use for trading.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

===1736–1840===
Around 1736, Huntokonu set up a trading post which began the growth of Badagri main town as a center of trade. Eastward migration into Badagry contributed to the growth of the town. Badagry provided waterways to Lagos and to the interior which enhanced its commercial location. However, the rise of Badagry led to hostilities with Ouidah, which sacked the town in 1784.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

Commercial activities of slave traders were less in Badagri than in [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], Angola, Ouidah, and [[Akwa Akpa|Calabar]]; in 1865, slaves transported out of Badagri were 800, while at Porto Novo, the figure was 1,200, and at Ouidah, up to 5,000 slaves were transported.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt; The peak period of the slave trade in the city state was between 1736 and 1789, but the trade continued to the early nineteenth century. The trade was dominated by Portuguese and Brazilian traders. After the British abolished the slave trade, notable trader [[Francisco Félix de Sousa]] migrated to Badagri around 1807.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

===1840–1900===
The [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1884–1885, led to the displacement of the Gbe ethnolinguistic groups in the area, with especially the Badagry-Ogu ethnic group falling under the British rule, and marginalized through being removed from the rest of the ethnoliguistic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kunnuji |first1=Jospeh |title=Guided syncretism: repackaging Badagry-Ogu music in the context of Lagos' postcolonial modernity |journal=Africn Music |date=2017 |volume=10 |issue=3 |page=79 |doi=10.21504/amj.v10i3.2197 |url=http://journal.ru.ac.za/index.php/africanmusic/article/view/2197 |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barry Selwyn Gustafson''' (born 1938) is a New Zealand [[political scientist]] and [[historian]], and a leading political biographer.  He served for nearly four decades as Professor of [[Political Studies]] at the [[University of Auckland]], and as Acting Director of the [[New Zealand Asia Institute]] from 2004 to 2006. He has contested various [[Elections in New Zealand|general election]]s, first for the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] and later for the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], coming second each time.

==Early life==
Barry Selwyn Gustafson was born in Auckland in 1938.  He was educated at Auckland, [[Massey University|Massey]] and [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]] Universities (BA 1960, MA 1962, PhD 1974).{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|loc=dust-jacket}}

==Politics and academia==
He was a member of the Labour Party from 1954 to 1981, and stood in two general elections as a candidate; in {{NZ election link year|1960}} and in {{NZ election link year|1966}}. In 1960, he contested the "blue-ribbon" {{NZ electorate link|Remuera}} electorate and lost by 6109 votes to National's [[Ronald Algie]]. In 1966, he contested the {{NZ electorate link|Taupo}} electorate and narrowly lost by 258 votes by National's [[Rona Stevenson]]. He wrote that National was afraid of losing the seat so poured ''thousands of dollars'' into the campaign. A hundred Waikato women canvassed every house in Tokoroa and Putaruru over two days, using the ''street lists and blue dot system''.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|pp=91,280}}

In 1968 he joined the staff at Auckland University, and during his long tenure at Auckland he has authored several leading books on the topic of New Zealand politics.  He wrote ''Social Change and Party Reorganisation'' (1976) and ''Labour’s Path to Political Independence'' (1980) while still a Labour Party member, but after completing ''The First 50 Years: A History of the New Zealand National Party'' (1986) changed allegiance to National. In 1986 he also published ''From the Cradle to the Grave: A Biography of [[Michael Joseph Savage]]''.

In [[New Zealand general election, 1987|1987]] he stood as a National candidate for the [[Birkenhead (New Zealand electorate)|Birkenhead electorate]] to replace the retiring [[Jim McLay]], but was defeated by the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] candidate, [[Jenny Kirk (politician)|Jenny Kirk]].

During the 1990s Gustafson was given a number of international academic appointments, including visiting researcher at Stanford University and the European Union in 1990, and research at a number of [[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] Universities in 1994.  In 1997 Gustafson was [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Visiting Professor]] at [[Georgetown University]].  From 1998 to 2002 Gustafson was appointed Head of the Political Studies Department, and he was also Pro [[Vice-Chancellor]] (International) of the University from 2001 to 2002.  In 2000 he published ''His Way: A Biography of [[Robert Muldoon]]''.

Gustafson's teaching interests are predominantly the [[European Union]], [[civil society]], the development of New Zealand’s political culture and parties, political leadership and power, and [[interdisciplinary studies]]. For 25 years he also taught [[Soviet Studies|Soviet]] and [[East European Studies]].

In 2004 Gustafson retired as Professor of Political Studies, and was appointed Acting Director of the New Zealand Asia Institute, a position he held until 2006.  In this time he helped to establish a [[New Zealand Studies]] Centre at [[Peking University]].  In 2007 he published ''Kiwi Keith: A Biography of [[Keith Holyoake]]''.

'''Carolyn Merchant''' (born July 12, 1936 in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) is an [[Americans|American]] [[Ecofeminism|ecofeminist]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and historian of science&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7oojAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Carolyn+Merchant%22++1936&amp;dq=%22Carolyn+Merchant%22++1936&amp;cd=4 American political thought] Kenneth M. Dolbeare  - 1998 - Page 523&lt;/ref&gt; most famous for her theory (and book of the same title) on 'The Death of Nature', whereby she identifies the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as the period when [[science]] began to atomize, objectify and dissect nature, foretelling its eventual conception as inert. Her works were important in the development of [[environmental history]] and the [[history of science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecnr.berkeley.edu/facPage/dispFP.php?I=617 Carolyn Merchant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621170436/http://ecnr.berkeley.edu/facPage/dispFP.php?I=617 |date=June 21, 2007 }} Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindfully.org/Sustainability/Carolyn-Merchant-ConversationJun02.htm A conversation with Carolyn Merchant (2002)] RUSSELL SCHOCH / California Monthly* v.112, n.6, Jun02&lt;/ref&gt;  She is Professor of Environmental History, Philosophy, and Ethics at [[UC Berkeley]].

== Ideology ==
She writes, "The female [[earth]] was central to organic [[cosmology]] that was undermined by the [[Scientific Revolution]] and the rise of a [[market (economics)|market]]-oriented culture...for sixteenth-century [[Europe]]ans the root metaphor binding together the self, [[society]] and the  [[cosmos]] was that of an [[organism]]...[[organismic theory]] emphasized interdependence among the parts of the human body, subordination of individual to communal purposes in [[family]], community, and [[State (polity)|state]], and vital life permeate the cosmos to the lowliest stone." (Merchant, ''The Death of Nature'', 1980: 278)

Merchant tells us that prior to the Enlightenment, Nature was conceived of as the benevolent mother of all things, albeit sometimes wild.  This metaphor was to gradually be replaced by the 'dominion' model as the Scientific Revolution rationalized and dissected nature to show all her secrets. As nature revealed her secrets, so too she was able to be controlled.  Both this intention and the metaphor of 'nature unveiled' is still prevalent in scientific language.  Conceptions of the Earth as nurturing bringer of life began slowly to change to one of a resource to be exploited as science became more and more confident that human minds could know all there was about the natural world and thereby effect changes on it at will.  Merchant cites [[Francis Bacon]]'s use of female metaphors to describe the exploitation of nature at this time was telling:  "she is either free,...or driven out of her ordinary course by the perverseness, insolence and forwardness of matter and violence of impediments...or she is put in constraint, molded and made as it were new by art and the hand of man; as in things artificial...nature takes orders from man and works under his authority" (Bacon in Merchant 1990: 282).  Nature must be "bound into service" and made a slave to the human ends of regaining our dominion over nature lost in the 'fall from grace' in Eden.

In combination with increasing [[industrialization]] and the rise of [[capitalism]] that simultaneously replaced women's work like [[weaving]] with machinery, and subsumed their roles as subsistence agriculturists also drove people to live in cities, further removing them from nature and the effects of industrialised production on it.  The combined effects of industrialization, scientific exploration of nature and the ascendancy of the dominion/domination metaphor over the nurturing Mother Earth one, according to Merchant,  can still be felt in social and political thought, as much as it was evident in the art, philosophy and science of the 16th century.

== Education, Accolades, Employment and Involvement ==
Carolyn Merchant received her A.B. in Chemistry from [[Vassar College]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vq.vassar.edu/issues/2008/02/beyond-vassar/mixed-media.html|title=Mixed Media - Vassar, the Alumnae/i Quarterly|website=vq.vassar.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then went to the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] to earn an M.A. and Ph.D. in the History of Science and later received an honorary doctorate from [[Umeå University|Umea University]] in Umea, Sweden, where she was teaching as a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Senior Fellow]]. Currently, she is a professor of environmental history, philosophy, and ethics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="CV.html"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nature.berkeley.edu/departments/espm/env-hist/cv.html|title=CV.html|website=nature.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, as a high school senior, Merchant was a Top Ten Finalist for the [[Westinghouse Science Talent Search]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://student.societyforscience.org/science-talent-search-1954|title=Science Talent Search 1954|date=2016-06-28|work=Student Science|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the first to be awarded the E. B. Fred Fellowship, a program established at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to demonstrate that women could make significant contributions to professional fields. In 1963, Merchant, along with 13 other women out of a pool of 114 applicants, was awarded a three-year grant to fund field non-specific graduate research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.wisc.edu/home/archives/gopher/education93/00000052.html|title=Graduate: Fellowships|website=pubs.wisc.edu|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 she was a Fulbright Senior Scholar at the [[Umeå University|University of Umea]] in Umea, Sweden, where she taught in the Department of History of Ideas.&lt;ref name="CV.html"/&gt;

Prior to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she started in 1986 and still teaches, she was a lecturer in the History of Science,  Department of Physics and Natural Sciences Interdisciplinary Program at the [[University of San Francisco]] from 1969 to 1977. She was a visiting professor at [[Oregon State University]] in the History of Science Department and General Science Department in 1969.&lt;ref name="CV.html"/&gt;

Merchant has been a member of the [[History of Science Society]] since 1962. She was chair of the Committee on Women of Science from 1973-1974 and co-chair from 1992-1994.  From 1971-1972 she was co-president of the West Coast History of Science Society. She has been a member ef the [[American Society for Environmental History]] since 1980 and has held positions such as vice-president and president in addition to serving as associate Editor of the ''Environmental Review'' and as a member of the Rachel Carson Prize Committee for best dissertation.&lt;ref name="CV.html"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Carolyn Merchant’s ''The Death of Nature:  Women, Ecology, and the Scientific Revolution'' leaves a scholarly legacy in the fields of environmental history, philosophy, and feminism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warren|first=K. J.|title=''The Legacy of Carolyn Merchant's the Death of Nature''|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0921810698112005|journal=Organization &amp; Environment|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=186–188|doi=10.1177/0921810698112005|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is considered groundbreaking due her connection between the feminization of nature and the naturalization of women. Along with this connection, she backs up her claim with historical evidence during the time of enlightenment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Merchant was not the first to present on ecofeminist ideals and theories. [[Françoise d'Eaubonne]] coined the term [[ecofeminism]]e to portray the influence of women and their ability to generate an ecological revolution in her book ''Le Feminisme ou la Morte''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Féminisme ou la mort|last=d'Eaubonne|first=Françoise|publisher=|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Griffin's book, ''Women and Nature:  The Roaring Inside Her'', also talks about women ecology was written in 1978 before the ''Death of Nature'' was written.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Nature:  The Roaring Inside her|last=Griffin|first=Susan|publisher=|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Death of Nature'' is influential despite these earlier works because it is the first interpretation of an ecofeminist perspective on history ecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Publications ==
Carolyn Merchant has published numerous literary works focusing on interaction between humans and their natural habitat. Merchant examined the trends and behaviors individuals develop through time. Additionally, she started concentrating on ecology and women's movements and their development in society. Merchant's passion for environmental history, philosophy and ethics is demonstrated in her publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/American_environmental_leaders.html?id=bgFhR7Az9_kC|title=American environmental leaders: from Colonial times to the present|first=Anne|last=Becher|date=20 July 2017|publisher=ABC-Clio|isbn=9781576071625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Death of Nature ====
The Death of Nature is Merchant's most well received book. In this book she emphasizes on the importance of gender in the historiography of modern science. Additionally, she focuses her book on "the sexist assumptions that informed sixteenth-and seventeenth-century conceptions of the universe and human physiology." Merchant expresses the importance of gender in early modern writing on nature too, and its use of environmental, social, and literary history to have a context for the history of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Katharine|date=2006-01-01|title=Women, Gender, and Utopia: The Death of Nature and the Historiography of Early Modern Science|jstor=508078|journal=Isis|volume=97|issue=3|pages=487–495|doi=10.1086/508078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cornelis Dirk (Cees) Andriesse''' ([[Leeuwarden (city)|Leeuwarden]], 21 December 1939) is a Dutch [[physicist]], writer and [[historian of science]]. Internationally he is best known for his scientific biography of [[Christiaan Huygens]].

== Education ==
Andriesse studied [[applied physics]] at [[Delft University of Technology]], where he specialized in [[radiation]] physics. In 1969 he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree from the same university with a thesis on the [[scattering]] of [[neutron]]s in gaseous [[argon-36]]. After that, he initiated a research project on the force between noble gas atoms.

== Research ==
He then worked at the [[Kapteyn Observatory]] in [[Roden (Drenthe)|Roden]], part of the [[University of Groningen]]. In 1978 he was the first to calculate the radiation of [[interstellar dust]] with a fluctuating temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978A%26A....66..169A Platt Particles in M17?]&lt;/ref&gt; Only after the turn of the century Infrared observations from space showed the calculated [[spectrum]] to be characteristic of all [[galaxy|galaxies]]. In 1979 Andriesse came up with a theory for the [[stellar wind|mass loss]] of [[star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979Ap%26SS..61..205A Fluctuation Theory of the Mass Flux from the Stars] – summarized in [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ARA%26A..24..329C C. Chiosi &amp; A. Maeder, "The Evolution of Massive Stars", ''Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics'', '''24''' (1986), 329-375]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluctuation Theory===
There are two classic explanations for the mass loss of stars by [[stellar wind]]s. For stars of high luminosity [[radiation pressure]] is the driving force; for fainter stars like the [[Sun]] the stellar wind is driven by mechanical effects such as [[shock wave]]s or [[magnetic field]]s. To what level a stellar wind swells, depends on accidental features of the mechanism. The strength of the wind is not easily related to the basic properties of the star ([[mass]], [[radius]], and [[luminosity]]).

Andriesse's fluctuation theory is a [[metatheory]] for the two mechanisms mentioned. It does not matter much which mechanism occurs in a certain star, as long as that mechanism meets certain requirements: the stellar wind must take the form of puffs that are so pronounced that they affect the [[Types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] between gravitational and thermal forces of the star as a whole. Only after the equilibrium is regained, a subsequent puff may take place.

The fluctuation theory establishes a clear link between the strength of the stellar wind and the basic properties of the star, which, as mentioned above, the mechanisms by themselves cannot establish. Metatheories are not very common in [[astrophysics]]. Also fluctuations are usually ignored rather than taken as a starting point. When the fluctuation theory, which Andriesse still sees as his best work,&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Köbben &amp; H. Tromp, De onwelkome boodschap, Mets, Amsterdam (1999) p. 73: In Groningen he [Andriesse] develops theoretical ideas that give him great satisfaction – years later he is still lyrical about this theory … ‘the best of my achievements.’&lt;/ref&gt; did not gain much acceptance, Andriesse left astrophysics in disappointment in 1980.

===Nuclear Energy===
He joined the research institute [[KEMA]] of the Dutch electricity companies in [[Arnhem]] and started a ‘source-term’ program, with the aim to determine which and how many radioactive substances would be released by [[nuclear reactors]], when they become overheated. Tiny amounts of [[uranium oxide]], irradiated by [[neutrons]], and thus containing [[fission products]], were heated above 2,000 degrees. When these experiments were under way, the nuclear reactor in [[Chernobyl]] exploded. There happened outdoors what Andriesse with his student Richard Tanke were doing inside a safe laboratory &lt;ref&gt;R.H.J. Tanke, Mass– and gamma spectrometric measurements of fission products released from overheated, fresh irradiated, uranium dioxide, Journal of Nuclear Materials 188 (1992) 262-272.&lt;/ref&gt; His results, presented to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], showed that even at very high temperatures most fission products will stay in the reactor core &lt;ref&gt;C.D. Andriesse, [http://cdandriesse.byethost6.com/source/source.pdf Interpretation of fission product release from overheated fuel], [Invited paper for an international symposium in Columbus, Ohio], pp 65-76 in: Source term evaluation for [nuclear] accident conditions, IAEA-SM-281/6, Vienna (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; He later cautioned for an explosion of the [[Petten nuclear reactor]] caused by a sudden break of the cooling circuit.

== Professor ==
In 1989 Andriesse was appointed professor of electricity supply at the [[University of Utrecht]]. This position was paid by KEMA. Commotion arose, when he expressed opinions about the safety of nuclear power plants, which were too negative in the eyes of KEMA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ru.nl/vawo/postdocs/artikelen/groeneamsterdammer-de_etalageprofessor.htm The showcase professor] {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually the conflict was resolved by Andriesse moving to a position financed by the University of Utrecht. As professor of energy physics, he investigated why [[photovoltaic cell]]s are more [[efficiency|efficient]] in using [[solar energy]] than [[plant]]s. [[Molecular]] transport in [[plant cell]]s turned out to be the [[limiting factor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdandriesse.byethost6.com/publicaties/photosynthesis.pdf Minimum entropy production in photosynthesis (pdf)] [http://cdandriesse.byethost6.com/nabla.html additional note]&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands]] he studied the [[Pebble Bed Reactor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ravagedigitaal.org/1997/227/Het_einde_van_d227.htm The end of the Pebble Bed Reactor?] {{nl icon}}; [http://www.ecn.nl/docs/library/report/1996/c96050.pdf Technology Assessment HTR – Summary and Conclusions] {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Andriesse formally retired. He remained active at the Institute for the History and Foundations of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (IGG) of the University of Utrecht for several more years.

== Books ==
After age forty Andriesse started to write [[fiction]] for a general audience. In his novels, he steps back from exact science and sketches poetic, often erratic images of a disordered world. His first historical novel "Titan kan niet slapen" ({{en icon}} "[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] cannot sleep") got a place on the longlist of the [[AKO Literatuurprijs]] in 1994. It is about the life and works of Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695), and it has been translated in French and English. “De opstand” and “Alsnog een portret voor Heinsius” are historical novels about the physician Gadso Coopmans (1746–1810) and the politician Anthonie Heinsius (1641–1720). He also wrote books about the history of physics, nuclear energy and science publishing.

'''Florence O'Donoghue''' (1895&amp;ndash;18 December 1967) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[historian]] and head of [[intelligence]] of the Cork No. 1 [[Brigade]] of the [[Irish Republican Army]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]].

He was born in [[Rathmore, County Kerry|Rathmore]], [[County Kerry]], [[Ireland]] in 1895. He moved to [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in 1910, where he worked as an [[apprentice]] in the [[drapery]] trade.

== Military life ==

The 1916 [[Easter Rising]] was a watershed in O'Donoghue's life.&lt;ref&gt;John Borgonovo, ''Florence and Josephine O'Donoghue's War of Independence: A Destiny That Shapes Our Ends'', Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1916, Florence joined the Cork branch of the [[Irish Volunteers]]. In early 1917, he was elected unanimously [[1st Lieutenant]] of the [[Company (military unit)|Cyclist Company]] and as result devoted all his spare time to Volunteer work. He began writing weekly for two years for the ''Irish World'' [[newspaper]]. By May 1917, he was sworn into the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] and in October, [[Tomás Mac Curtain]] appointed O'Donoghue as [[communication]]s of the Cork Brigade. He replaced Pat Higgins as Brigade Adjutant in February 1917. O'Donoghue was a key organiser in the sensational jail-break of Captain [[Donnchadh Mac Niallghuis]] on Armistice Day 1918 and took personal responsibility for his protection. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] was the last officer from Volunteers General Headquarters to visit Cork shortly after Christmas 1919, until the [[Irish War of Independence#The Truce— an uneasy peace|truce]] in 1921.

O'Donoghue built up an [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] network and agents which included his future wife, Josephine Marchment. She was head female clerk at the 6th Division Headquarters at Victoria Barracks, Cork and passed on secret [[British Armed Forces|British Army]] correspondence to him. Florence recruited people to open letters, tap phone lines and intercept telegrams. The [[Irish Republican Army]] had 2,000 active members in Cork which were also used for intelligence gathering. By March 1920, after killing a [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Inspector, Florence was on the run and serving full-time in the [[Irish Republican Army]]. In November that year, the Cork Brigade killed six British Army Officers and executed five Cork civilians on suspicion of spying.

After two and a half years of fighting, a truce was agreed on 11 July 1921. When the [[Dáil]] approved the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], in January 1922, the army split into pro- and anti-treaty camps. Over the coming months and after being elected onto the army’s executive as [[Adjutant-General]], O'Donoghue warned of the dangers of an [[Irish Civil War]]. In June 1922, he resigned from the army's national executive and a month later, on 3 July 1922, from the army. Civil war did break out on June 28, 1922 between pro and anti treaty factions, much to O'Donoghue's dismay.

During the civil war, he remained neutral and tried to organise a truce to end the fighting. In December 1922, he formed a group called the "[[Neutral IRA]]", along with [[Sean O'Hegarty]], composed of pro-truce IRA men. O'Donoghue claimed he had 20,000 members in this group. He campaigned for a month's truce between the two sides, so that a political compromise could be reached. However, his efforts came to nothing and in March 1923, he wound up the "Neutral IRA", judging that its objectives could not be achieved. The civil war ended in late April 1923.

He served as [[Major]] in the [[Irish Defence Forces|Irish Army]] from 1939-1946. He formed a Supplementary Intelligence Service that would remain behind enemy lines in the event of an invasion. He also taught [[guerrilla war]] tactics to new army recruits.

== Home life ==

Florence married Josephine Marchment in April 1921 and had four children. The couple also adopted two children from Josephine’s first marriage, including Reggie Brown, whom Florence kidnapped from his grandparents in Wales in 1920. Florence became a rate collector and remained outside politics.

In later years he became a respected [[historian]]. While in the army he edited ''[[An Cosantóir]]'', the Irish Army’s magazine. He convinced [[Éamon de Valera]] to establish the [[Bureau of Military History]] which would record personal accounts from the Irish War of Independence. O'Donoghue was a recording officer until 1948. His most famous work is his biography on [[Liam Lynch (general)|Liam Lynch]], entitled ''No Other Law''.

O'Donoghue died on 18 December 1967 and [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] gave the graveside [[oration]].

Born in [[Shanghai]] where his father, a [[Dundalk]] man, captained a ship on the [[Yellow River]], Byrne was evacuated with his mother to [[Australia]] on the outbreak of [[World War II]]. After the war, his mother returned to Ireland, where his father, who had survived internment in [[Japan]]ese hands, returned to take up work as a harbour master.

Byrne attended [[Blackrock College]] in [[County Dublin]] where he learned [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]], to add to the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] he had learned in his Shanghai childhood. He studied Early Irish History at [[University College Dublin]] where he excelled, graduating with first class honours. He studied [[Paleography]] and [[Medieval Latin]] in Germany, and then lectured on [[Celtic languages]] in [[Sweden]], before returning to University College in 1964 to take up a professorship.

Byrne's best known work is his ''Irish Kings and High-Kings'' (1973). He was joint editor of the [[Royal Irish Academy]]'s ''New History of Ireland'' (9 volumes). A [[festschrift]] in his honour was published in 1999 under the editorship of his former student Alfred P. Smyth. 

He retired in 2000.

'''Gandhāra''' was an ancient state, a ''[[mahajanapada]]'', in the [[Valley of Peshawar|Peshawar basin]] in the northwest portion of the [[Indian subcontinent]], present-day [[Pakistan]]. The center of the region was at the confluence of the [[Kabul River|Kabul]] and [[Swat River|Swat]] rivers, bounded by the [[Sulaiman Mountains]] on the west and the [[Indus River]] on the east. The [[Safed Koh]] mountains separated it from the [[Kohat District|Kohat]] region to the south. This being the core area of Gandhara, the cultural influence of "Greater Gandhara" extended across the Indus river to the [[Taxila]] region and westwards into the [[Kabul River|Kabul]] and  [[Bamiyan]] valleys in Afghanistan, and northwards up to the [[Karakoram]] range.{{sfn|Neelis, Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Eggermont, Alexander's Campaigns in Sind and Baluchistan|1975|pp=175–177}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Ernst |last=Badian |title=Alexander at Peucelaotis |journal=The Classical Quarterly |volume=37 |number=1 |year=1987 |pp=117-128 |JSTOR=639350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhara was one of sixteen ''mahajanapadas'' (large conglomerations of urban and rural areas) of [[ancient India]] mentioned in Buddhist sources such as [[Anguttara Nikaya]].&lt;ref name="Higham2014"&gt;{{citation|last=Higham|first=Charles|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1c1UIEVH9gC&amp;pg=PA209|year=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0996-1|pages=209–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Devi2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Khoinaijam Rita Devi|title=History of ancient India: on the basis of Buddhist literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R0UwAQAAIAAJ|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Akansha Publishing House|isbn=978-81-8370-086-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid period]] and [[Hellenistic period]], its capital city was [[Pushkalavati]] (Greek: Peucelaotis), modern [[Charsadda]].{{efn|group=note|[[Pushkalavati|Puṣkalavati]] meaning "Lotus City" in Sanskrit}}  Later the capital city was moved to Peshawar{{efn|group=note|[[Sanskrit]] Puruṣapura, literally meaning "city of men", from ''puruṣa'', "(primordial) man" and ''pura'', "city".}} by the [[Kushan]] emperor [[Kanishka the Great]] in about AD 127.

Gandhara existed since the time of the [[Rigveda]] (c. 1500–1200 BC),&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv01126.htm | title= Rigveda 1.126:7, English translation by Ralph TH Griffith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macdonell1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|title=A History of Sanskrit Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wM-dNOa7fMC&amp;pg=PA130|year=1997|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishe|isbn=978-81-208-0095-3|pages=130–}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Zoroastrian [[Avesta]], which mentions it as ''Vaēkərəta'', the sixth most beautiful place on earth, created by [[Ahura Mazda]]. Gandhara was [[Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley|conquered by the Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BC. Conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] in 327 BC, it subsequently became part of the [[Maurya Empire]] and then the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. The region was a major center for [[Greco-Buddhism]] under the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greeks]] and [[Gandharan Buddhism]] under later dynasties. It was also a central location for the spread of Buddhism to Central Asia and East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/SALANC.html "UW Press: Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from Gandhara"].

The two regions shared cultural and political connections and trade relations and this facilitated the adoption and exchange of religious ideas.

The Persian term ''[[Shahi]]'' is used by historian [[Al-Biruni]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Kalhana]] Rajatarangini referred to them as simply ''Shahi'' and inscriptions refer to them as ''sahi''.(Wink, pg 125)&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the ruling dynasty&lt;ref&gt;Al Biruni refers to the subsequent rulers as "Brahman kings"; however, most other references such as [[Kalahan]] refer to them as [[kshatriya]]s. (Wink, pg 125)&lt;/ref&gt; that took over from the ''Kabul Shahi''&lt;ref&gt;[[Kabul Shahi]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ruled the region during the period prior to Muslim conquests of the 10th and 11th centuries. After it was conquered by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in 1001&amp;nbsp;AD, the name Gandhara disappeared. During the Muslim period, the area was administered from [[Lahore]] or from [[Kabul]]. During [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] times, it was an independent district which included the Kabul province.

The boundaries of Gandhara varied throughout history. Sometimes the ''[[Peshawar]]'' Valley and ''[[Taxila]]'' were collectively referred to as Gandhara; sometimes the [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat Valley]] (Sanskrit: ''Suvāstu'') was also included. The heart of Gandhara, however, was always the [[Peshawar Valley]]. The kingdom was ruled from capitals at ''Kapisa'' (''[[Bagram]]''),&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/catalogueofcoins01lahoiala&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pushkalavati'' (''[[Charsadda]]''), ''Taxila'', ''Puruṣapura'' (''Peshawar'') and in its final days from ''Udabhandapura'' (''[[Hund, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Hund'']]) on the [[River Indus]].

===Stone age===
Evidence of the Stone Age human inhabitants of Gandhara, including stone tools and burnt bones, was discovered at Sanghao near [[Mardan]] in area caves. The artifacts are approximately 15,000 years old. More recent excavations point to 30,000 years before the present.

===Vedic Gandhara===
{{main|Gandhara Kingdom|Indo-Aryan migration|Vedic civilization}}
Gandhara was an ancient kingdom of the [[Peshawar]] Valley, extending between the [[Swat River|Swat]] valley and [[Potohar plateau]] regions of [[Pakistan]] as well as the [[Jalalabad]] district of northeastern [[Afghanistan]]. In an archaeological context, the [[Vedic period]] in Gandhara corresponds to the [[Gandhara grave culture]].

The name of the [[Gandhari people|Gandhāris]] is attested in the Rigveda ([[Mandala 1|RV 1]].126.7&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"/&gt;). The ''Gandhāris'', along with the ''Balhikas'' (Bactrians), Mūjavants, [[Anga]]s, and the [[Magadha]]s, are also mentioned in the [[Atharvaveda]] (AV 5.22.14), as distant people. Gandharas are included in the [[Uttarapatha]] division of Puranic and Buddhistic traditions. The [[Aitareya Brahmana]] refers to King Nagnajit of Gandhara who was a contemporary of [[Janaka]], king of [[Videha]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H. C. Raychaudhuri]], ''Political History of Ancient India'' (1996), p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahajanapada===

Gandhara was one of sixteen ''[[mahajanapada]]s'' of [[ancient India]].&lt;ref name="Higham2014"&gt;{{citation|last=Higham|first=Charles|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1c1UIEVH9gC&amp;pg=PA209|year=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0996-1|pages=209–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Devi2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Khoinaijam Rita Devi|title=History of ancient India: on the basis of Buddhist literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R0UwAQAAIAAJ|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Akansha Publishing House|isbn=978-81-8370-086-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary cities of Gandhara were Puruṣapura ([[Peshawar]]), Takṣaśilā ([[Taxila]]), and [[Pushkalavati]] ([[Charsadda]]). The latter remained the capital of Gandhara down to the 2nd century AD, when the capital was moved to Peshawar. An important Buddhist shrine helped to make the city a centre of pilgrimage until the 7th century. Pushkalavati, in the Peshawar Valley, is situated at the [[confluence]] of the [[Swat River|Swat]] and [[Kabul River|Kabul]] rivers, where three different branches of the River Kabul meet. That specific place is still called Prang (from Prayāga) and considered sacred; local people still bring their dead there for burial. Similar geographical characteristics are found at site of Prang in Kashmir and at the confluence of the [[Ganges River|Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]], where the sacred city of [[Prayag]] is situated, west of [[Varanasi|Benares]]. There are some legends{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} in which the two rivers are said to be joined here by the underground [[Sarasvati River]], forming a triveṇī, a confluence of three rivers. However, [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] texts, and modern research, suggest that the path of the Sarasvati River was very different. It ended in the ocean at Kachchh in modern Gujrat and not at Prayag. The Gandharan city of Taxila was an important Buddhist and Hindu centre of learning from the 5th century BC&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/139 UNESCO World Heritage Centre: Taxila]&lt;/ref&gt; to the 2nd century.

Gandhara is mentioned in the Hindu epics, the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Ramayana]], as a western kingdom. In Treta Yuga, before Lord Rama, during the reigns of [[Muchukunda]], the kingdom of Gandhara was founded by the Druhyu prince Gandhara who was the son of King Angara of Druhyu Dynasty. During [[Ramayana]] time King Nagnajit(1) who was a contemporary of Lord [[Rama]] was defeated and killed by Rama's brother Bharata and Bharata's 1st son Taksha established Takshasila ([[Taxila]]) in [[Gandhara Kingdom]] on the banks of river Sindhu and Pushkara established Pushkaravati or Purushapura ([[Pushkar]]) in Gandharva tribe on the banks of river Saraswati after defeating and killing its king Sailusha who was the father-in-law of [[Vibhishana]]. In Dvapara Yuga, Gandhara prince [[Shakuni]] was the root of all the conspiracies of [[Duryodhana]] against the [[Pandavas]], which finally resulted in the [[Kurukshetra War]]. Shakuni's sister was the wife of the [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] king [[Dhritarashtra]] and was known as [[Gandhari (character)|Gandhari]]. Gandhara was in modern Pakistan. [[Puskalavati]], ''Takshasila'' ([[Taxila]]) and ''Purushapura'' ([[Peshawar]]) were cities in this Gandhara kingdom. Takshasila was founded by [[Raghava Rama]]'s brother [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]]. Bharata's descendants ruled this kingdom afterwards. During epic period it was ruled by Shakuni's father ''Suvala'', Shakuni and Shakuni's son. [[Arjuna]] defeated Shakuni's son during his post-war military campaign for [[Yudhishthira]]'s [[Aswamedha]] Yagna.

The main Vedic tribes remaining in the [[Indus Valley]] by 550 BC were the ''Kamboja'', ''Sindhu'', ''Taksas'' of Gandhara, the ''Madras'' and ''Kathas'' of the [[River Chenab]], ''Mallas'' of the [[River Ravi]] and ''Tugras'' of the [[River Sutlej]]. These several tribes and principalities fought against one another to such an extent that the Indus Valley no longer had one powerful Vedic tribal kingdom to defend against outsiders and to wield the warring tribes into one organized kingdom. The area was wealthy and fertile, yet infighting led misery and despair. King Pushkarasakti of Gandhara was engaged in power struggles against his local rivals and as such the [[Khyber Pass]] remained poorly defended. [[King Darius I]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] took advantage of the opportunity and planned for an invasion. The Indus Valley was fabled in Persia for its gold and fertile soil and conquering it had been a major objective of his predecessor [[Cyrus The Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Histories, epigraphy and authority: Achaemenid and indigenous control in Pakistan in the 1st millennium BC [http://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/bannu-archaeological-project/petrie2007_02.pd]{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 542 BC, Cyrus had led his army and conquered the Makran coast in southern [[Balochistan]]. However, he is known to have campaigned beyond Makran (in the regions of [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]], [[Khuzdar]], [[Panjgur]]) and lost most of his army in the ''Gedrosian Desert'' (speculated today as the [[Kharan Desert]]).

In 518 BC, Darius led his army through the Khyber Pass and southwards in stages, eventually reaching the [[Arabian Sea]] coast in Sindh by 516 BC. Under Persian rule, a system of centralized administration, with a bureaucratic system, was introduced into the Indus Valley for the first time. Provinces or "satrapy" were established with provincial capitals:

[[Gandhara#Part of Achaemenid Empire|Gandhara]] satrapy, established 518 BC with its capital at [[Pushkalavati]] ([[Charsadda]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rafi U. Samad, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pNUwBYGYgxsC&amp;pg=PA33 ''The Grandeur of Gandhara: The Ancient Buddhist Civilization of the Swat, Peshawar, Kabul and Indus Valleys.''] Algora Publishing, 2011, p. 32 {{ISBN|0875868592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhara Satrapy was established in the general region of the old Gandhara grave culture, in what is today [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. During Achaemenid rule, the [[Kharosthi]] alphabet, derived from the one used for Aramaic (the official language of Achaemenids), developed here and remained the national script of Gandhara until 200 AD.

King Pushkarasakti was engaged in power struggles against his local rivals. The Achaemenids under [[Darius I|Darius]] penetrated to the region in 516 BC and annexed other parts of modern-day [[Punjab, Pakistan]] west to the [[Indus river]] and [[Sindh]].

The inscription on Darius' (521–486 BC) tomb at [[Naqsh-e Rustam|Naqsh-i-Rustam]] near Persepolis records Gadāra (Gandāra) along with [[Hindush]] (Hənduš, Sindh) in the list of ''satrapies''. By about 380 BC the Persian hold on the region had weakened. Many small kingdoms sprang up in Gandhara. In 327 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Gandhara as well as the Indian ''satrapies'' of the Persian Empire. The expeditions of Alexander were recorded by his court historians and by [[Arrian]] (around AD 175) in his ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' and by other chroniclers many centuries after the event.

Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]] conducted some excavations there in 1962, and identified various [[Achaemenid]] remains.

In the winter of 327 BC, Alexander invited all the chieftains in the remaining five Achaemenid satraps to submit to his authority. [[Ambhi]], then ruler of Taxila in the former [[Hindush]] satrapy complied, but the remaining tribes and clans in the former satraps of Gandhara, Arachosia, Sattagydia and Gedrosia rejected Alexander's offer.

The first tribe they encountered were the [[Aspasioi]] tribe of the [[Kunar Valley]], who initiated a fierce battle against Alexander, in which he himself was wounded in the shoulder by a dart. However, the Aspasioi eventually lost and 40,000 people were enslaved. Alexander then continued in a southwestern direction where he encountered the [[Assakenoi]] tribe of the [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]] &amp; [[Buner]] valleys in April 326 BC. The Assakenoi fought bravely and offered stubborn resistance to Alexander and his army in the cities of Ora, Bazira ([[Barikot]]) and Massaga. So enraged was Alexander about the resistance put up by the Assakenoi that he killed the entire population of Massaga and reduced its buildings to rubble. A similar slaughter then followed at Ora&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History and Culture of Indian People, The Age of Imperial Unity, Foreign Invasion|author=Mukerjee, R. K.|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;, another stronghold of the Assakenoi. The stories of these slaughters reached numerous Assakenians, who began fleeing to Aornos, a hill-fort located between [[Shangla]] and [[Kohistan District, Pakistan|Kohistan]]. Alexander followed close behind their heels and besieged the strategic hill-fort, eventually capturing and destroying the fort and killing everyone inside. The remaining smaller tribes either surrendered or like the [[Astanenoi]] tribe of [[Pushkalavati ]]([[Charsadda]]) were quickly neutralized where 38,000 soldiers and 230,000 oxen were captured by Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;Curtius in McCrindle, p. 192, J.

Joshi; ''Kambojas Through the Ages'', 2005, p. 134, Kirpal Singh.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Alexander's smaller force would meet with the larger force which had come through the Khyber Pass met at [[Attock]]. With the conquest of Gandhara complete, Alexander switched to strengthening his military supply line, which by now stretched dangerously vulnerable over the [[Hindu Kush]] back to [[Balkh]] in Bactria.

After conquering Gandhara and solidifying his supply line back to Bactria, Alexander combined his forces with the King Ambhi of Taxila and crossed the River Indus in July 326 BC to begin the Archosia (Punjab) campaign. Alexander founded several new settlements in Gandhara, [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancientpakistan.info/pakistan-history-timeline/alexanders-empire/|title=Alexanders Empire – History of Ancient Pakistan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nominated officers as Satraps of the new provinces:

In Gandhara, [[Oxyartes]] was nominated to the position of Satrap by Alexander in 326 BC.

===Maurya arrival to Gandhara===

[[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya]]n dynasty, is said to have lived in Taxila when Alexander captured the city. According to tradition, he trained under [[Kautilya]], who remained his chief adviser throughout his reign. Supposedly using Gandhara and Vahika as his base, Chandragupta led a rebellion against the [[Magadha]] Empire and ascended the throne at [[Pataliputra]] in 321 BC. However, there are no contemporary Indian records of Chandragupta Maurya and almost all that is known is based on the diaries of [[Megasthenes]], the ambassador of Seleucus at Pataliputra, as recorded by [[Arrian]] in his ''[[Indica (Arrian)|Indika]]''. [[Ambhi]] hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all of his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title, and the gifts, but he also presented him with a wardrobe of: "Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted [[Hephaestion]] and [[Perdiccas]] in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.

On the subsequent advance of the [[Macedon]]ian king, [[Taxiles]] accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the [[battle of the Hydaspes River]]. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of [[Porus]], to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of [[Philip (son of Machatas)]]; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at [[Treaty of Triparadisus|Triparadisus]], 321 BC. Later Ambhi was deposed and killed by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], emperor of the [[Mauryan Empire]].
Gandhara was acquired from the [[Hellenistic period|Greeks]] by [[Chandragupta Maurya]].

After a battle with [[Seleucus Nicator]] (Alexander's successor in Asia) in 305 BC, the [[Mauryan]] Emperor extended his domain up to and including present Southern [[Afghanistan]]. With the completion of the Empire's Grand Trunk Road, the region prospered as a center of trade. Gandhara remained a part of the Mauryan Empire for about a century and a half.

[[Ashoka]], the grandson of Chandragupta, was one of the greatest Indian rulers. Like his grandfather, Ashoka also started his career in Gandhara as a governor. Later he supposedly became a [[Buddhist]] and promoted this religion in his empire. He built many ''stupas'' in Gandhara. Mauryan control over the northwestern frontier, including the [[Yona]]s, [[Kambojas]], and the Gandharas, is attested from the [[Rock Edicts]] left by Ashoka. According to one school of scholars, the Gandharas and Kambojas were [[Cognatic kinship|cognate]] people.&lt;ref&gt;Revue des etudes grecques 1973, p 131, Ch-Em Ruelle, Association pour l'encouragement des etudes grecques en France.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Early Indian Economic History, 1973, pp 237, 324, Rajaram Narayan Saletore.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myths of the Dog-man, 199, p 119, David Gordon White; Journal of the Oriental Institute, 1919, p 200; Journal of Indian Museums, 1973, p 2, Museums Association of India; The Pāradas: A Study in Their Coinage and History, 1972, p 52, Dr B.

===Graeco-Bactrians, Sakas, and Indo-Parthians===
[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] statue of standing Buddha, Gandhara (1st–2nd century), [[Tokyo National Museum]]]]

The decline of the Empire left the [[Indian subcontinent]] open to [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] invasions. Present-day southern Afghanistan was absorbed by [[Demetrius I of Bactria]] in 180 BC. Around about 185 BC, Demetrius invaded and conquered Gandhara and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Later, wars between different groups of Bactrian Greeks resulted in the independence of Gandhara from Bactria and the formation of the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]]. [[Menander I]] was its most famous king. He ruled from Taxila and later from [[Sagala]] (Sialkot). He rebuilt Taxila ([[Sirkap]]) and Pushkalavati. He became a Buddhist and is remembered in Buddhist records for his discussions with the great Buddhist philosopher, [[Nāgasena]], in the book ''[[Milinda Panha]]''.

[[File:Marine deities Gandhara.jpg|thumb|left|Marine deities, Gandhara.]]
Around the time of Menander's death in 140 BC, the Central Asian [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] overran Bactria and ended Greek rule there. Around 80 BC, the [[Saka]]s, diverted by their [[Parthia]]n cousins from Iran, moved into Gandhara and other parts of Pakistan and Western India. The most famous king of the Sakas, [[Maues]], established himself in Gandhara.

By 90 BC the [[Parthia]]ns had taken control of eastern Iran and, around 50 BC, they put an end to the last remnants of Greek rule in today's Afghanistan. Eventually an [[Indo-Parthian]] dynasty succeeded in taking control of Gandhara. The Parthians continued to support Greek artistic traditions. The start of the Gandharan [[Greco-Buddhist art]] is dated to about 75–50 BC. Links between Rome and the Indo-Parthian kingdoms existed.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland, Benjamin 1945 'Ganhdara and Early Christian Art: Buddha Palliatus', ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 49.4, 445–8 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/499859]&lt;/ref&gt; There is archaeological evidence that building techniques were transmitted between the two realms. Christian records claim that around AD 40 [[Thomas the Apostle]] visited the Indian subcontinent and encountered the Indo-Parthian king [[Gondophares]].&lt;ref&gt;Bracey, R 'Pilgrims Progress' [http://www.kushan.org/sources/thomasandapollonius.htm Brief Guide to Kushan History]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kushan Gandhara===
[[File:KanishkaCasket.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Casket of [[Kanishka the Great]], with Buddhist motifs]]
The Parthian dynasty fell about 75 to another group from Central Asia. The [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], known as [[Yuezhi]] in China (argued by some{{Who|date=July 2017}} to be ethnically [[Asii]]) moved from Central Asia to [[Bactria]], where they stayed for a century. Around 75, one of their tribes, the Kushan (Kuṣāṇa), under the leadership of Kujula Kadphises gained control of Gandhara and other parts of what is now Pakistan.

The Kushan period is considered the Golden Period of Gandhara. Peshawar Valley and Taxila are littered with ruins of ''stupas'' and monasteries of this period. Gandharan art flourished and produced some of the best pieces of sculpture from the Indian subcontinent. Many monuments were created to commemorate the [[Jataka]]s.

[[File:Gandharan sculpture - head of a bodhisattva.jpg|thumb|upright|Head of a bodhisattva, c.{{nbsp}}4th century]]
[[File:SFAAMBuddha.jpg|thumb|upright|The Seated Buddha, dating from 300 to 500 CE, was found near Jamal Garhi, and is now on display at the [[Asian Art Museum (San Francisco)|Asian Art Museum]] in [[San Francisco]].]]
Gandhara's culture peaked during the reign of the great Kushan king [[Kanishka the Great]] (128–151). The cities of Taxila (Takṣaśilā) at Sirsukh and Peshawar were built. Peshawar became the capital of a great empire stretching from Gandhara to Central Asia. Kanishka was a great patron of the Buddhist faith; Buddhism spread to Central Asia and the Far East across Bactria and [[Sogdia]], where his empire met the [[Han dynasty|Han Empire]] of China. Buddhist art spread from Gandhara to other parts of Asia. Under Kanishka, Gandhara became a holy land of Buddhism and attracted Chinese pilgrims eager to view the monuments associated with many [[Jataka tales|Jatakas]].

In Gandhara, [[Mahayana Buddhism]] flourished and Buddha was represented in human form. Under the Kushans new Buddhists ''stupas'' were built and old ones were enlarged. Huge statues of the Buddha were erected in monasteries and carved into the hillsides. Kanishka also built a great 400-foot tower at Peshawar. This tower was reported by Chinese monks [[Faxian]], [[Song Yun]], and [[Xuanzang]] who visited the country. This structure was destroyed and rebuilt many times until it was finally destroyed by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in the 11th century.

===Hepthalite Invasion===
[[File:Gandhara fortified city.jpg|thumb|upright|Gandhara fortified city depicted in a Buddhist relief]]
The [[Hephthalite|Hephthalite Huns]] captured Gandhara around 451, and did not adopt Buddhism, but in fact "perpetrated frightful massacres." [[Mihirakula]] became a "terrible persecutor" of the religion.&lt;ref name=Rene&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During their rule, [[Hinduism]] revived itself and the Buddhist Gandharan civilization declined.

The travel records of many Chinese Buddhist pilgrims record that Gandhara was going through a transformation during these centuries. Buddhism was declining, and Hinduism was rising. [[Faxian]] traveled around 400, when [[Prakrit]] was the language of the people, and Buddhism was flourishing. 100 years later, when [[Song Yun]] visited in 520, a different situation was described: the area had been destroyed by the [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]] and was ruled by [[Lae-Lih]], who did not practice the laws of the Buddha. [[Xuanzang]] visited India around 644 and found Buddhism on the wane in Gandhara and Hinduism in the ascendant. Gandhara was ruled by a king from Kabul, who respected Buddha's law, but Taxila was in ruins, and Buddhist monasteries were deserted.

===Kabul Shahi===
[[File:Sharing of relics and Gandhara fortified city.jpg|thumb|Sharing of the [[Buddha]]'s relics, above a Gandhara fortified city.]]
After the fall of the Sassanid Empire to the Arabs in 644, today's Afghanistan region and Gandhara came under pressure from Muslims. But they failed to extend their empire to Gandhara. Gandhara was first ruled by local kings who later expanded their kingdom onto an empire.

Gandhara was ruled from Kabul by [[Shahi|Kabulshahi]] for next 200 years. Sometime in the 9th century the [[Kabul Shahi]] replaced the Shahi. Based on various Muslim records it is estimated this occurred in 870. According to [[Al-Biruni]] (973–1048), Kallar, a Brahmin minister of the Kabulshahi, founded the [[Shahi]] dynasty in 843. The dynasty ruled from Kabul, later moved their capital to Udabhandapura. They built great temples all over their kingdoms. Some of these buildings are still in good condition in the [[Salt Range]] of the Punjab.

===Decline===
[[Jayapala]] was the last great king of this dynasty. His empire extended from west of Kabul to the river [[Sutlej]]. However, this expansion of Gandhara kingdom coincided with the rise of the powerful [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]] under [[Sabuktigin]]. Defeated twice by Sabuktigin and then by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in the Kabul valley, Jayapala gave his life on a [[funeral pyre]]. [[Anandapala]], a son of Jayapala, moved his capital near [[Nandana]] in the Salt Range. In 1021 the last king of this dynasty, [[Trilochanapala]], was assassinated by his own troops which spelled the end of Gandhara. Subsequently, some Shahi princes moved to Kashmir and became active in local politics.

The city of [[Kandahar]] in Afghanistan is said to have been named after Gandhara. According to H.W. Bellow, an emigrant from Gandhara in the 5th century brought this name to modern Kandahar. Faxian reported that the Buddha's alms-bowl existed in Peshawar Valley when he visited around 400 (chapter XII). In 1872 Bellow saw this huge begging bowl (seven feet in diameter) preserved in the shrine of Sultan Wais outside Kandahar. When [[Olaf Caroe]] wrote his book in 1958 (Caroe, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–171), this relic was reported to be at Kabul Museum. The present status of this bowl is unknown.

Writing c. 1030, [[Al Biruni]] reported on the devastation caused during the conquest of Gandhara and much of northwest India by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] following his defeat of Jayapala in the [[Battle of Peshawar (1001)|Battle of Peshawar]] at Peshawar in 1001:

{{quote|text=Now in the following times no Muslim conqueror passed beyond the frontier of Kâbul and the river Sindh until the days of the Turks, when they seized the power in Ghazna under the Sâmânî dynasty, and the supreme power fell to the lot of Nâṣir-addaula Sabuktagin. This prince chose the holy war as his calling, and therefore called himself ''al-Ghâzî'' ("the warrior/invader"). In the interest of his successors he constructed, in order to weaken the Indian frontier, those roads on which afterwards his son Yamin-addaula Maḥmûd marched into India during a period of thirty years and more. God be merciful to both father and son ! Maḥmûd utterly ruined the prosperity of the country, and performed there wonderful exploits, by which the Hindus became like atoms of dust scattered in all directions, and like a tale of old in the mouth of the people. Their scattered remains cherish, of course, the most inveterate aversion towards all Muslims. This is the reason, too, why Hindu sciences have retired far away from those parts of the country conquered by us, and have fled to places which our hand cannot yet reach, to Kashmir, Benares, and other places. And there the antagonism between them and all foreigners receives more and more nourishment both from political and religious sources.&lt;ref&gt;''Alberuni's India''. (c. 1030 AD).

Its numerous stone built cities, monasteries, and topes with their valuable and revered monuments and sculptures, were sacked, fired, razed to the ground, and utterly destroyed as habitations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;}}

==Rediscovery==
[[File:Shingerdar Stupa1.jpg|thumb|Many stupas, such as the Shingerdar stupa in [[Ghalegay]], are scattered throughout the region near [[Peshawar]].]]
By the time Gandhara had been absorbed into the empire of Mahmud of Ghazni, Buddhist buildings were already in ruins and Gandhara art had been forgotten. After Al-Biruni, the Kashmiri writer Kalhaṇa wrote his book ''Rajatarangini'' in 1151. He recorded some events that took place in Gandhara, and provided details about its last royal dynasty and capital [[Hund, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Udabhandapura]].

In the 19th century, British soldiers and administrators started taking an interest in the ancient history of the Indian Subcontinent. In the 1830s coins of the post-Ashoka period were discovered, and in the same period Chinese travelogues were translated. [[Charles Masson]], [[James Prinsep]], and [[Alexander Cunningham]] deciphered the [[Kharosthi]] script in 1838. Chinese records provided locations and site plans for Buddhist shrines. Along with the discovery of coins, these records provided clues necessary to piece together the history of Gandhara. In 1848 Cunningham found Gandhara sculptures north of Peshawar. He also identified the site of Taxila in the 1860s. From then on a large number of Buddhist statues were discovered in the Peshawar valley.

[[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Archaeologist John Marshall]] excavated at Taxila between 1912 and 1934. He discovered separate Greek, Parthian, and Kushan cities and a large number of ''stupas'' and monasteries. These discoveries helped to piece together much more of the chronology of the history of Gandhara and its art.

After 1947 [[Ahmed Hassan Dani]] and the Archaeology Department at the [[University of Peshawar]] made a number of discoveries in the Peshawar and Swat Valley. Excavation of many of the sites of Gandhara Civilization are being done by researchers from Peshawar and several universities around the world.

==Language==
The [[Gandharan Buddhist texts]] are both the earliest [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist]] as well as Asian manuscripts discovered so far. Most are written on birch bark and were found in labelled clay pots. [[Pāṇini|Panini]] has mentioned both the [[Vedas|Vedic]] form of Sanskrit as well as what seems to be [[Gandhari language|Gandhari]], a later form of Sanskrit, in his [[Ashtadhyayi]].

Gandhara's language was a [[Prakrit]] or "Middle Indo-Aryan" dialect, usually called Gāndhārī. The language used the Kharosthi script, which died out about the 4th century. However, [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Hindko]], and [[Kohistani language|Kohistani]], are derived from the Indo-Aryan [[Prakrit]]s that were spoken in Gandhara and surrounding areas. However, a language shift occurred as the ancient Gandharan culture gave way to Iranian invaders from Central Asia.&lt;ref name="Khaljies are Afghan"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Khaljies_are_Afghan.htm |title=Khaljies are Afghan |work=[[Abdul Hai Habibi]]|publisher=alamahabibi.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahāyāna Buddhism===
Mahāyāna [[Buddhist sutras#Pure Land Sutras|Pure Land sūtras]] were brought from the Gandhāra region to China as early as AD 147, when the [[Kushan]] monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]] began translating some of the first Buddhist sūtras into Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalog (T. 361)|url=http://www.acmuller.net/descriptive_catalogue/files/k0024.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest of these translations show evidence of having been translated from the Gāndhārī language.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee, Bratindra Nath. ''India in Early Central Asia.'' 1996. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Lokakṣema translated important [[Mahayana sutras|Mahāyāna sūtras]] such as the ''[[Prajñāpāramitā|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]'', as well as rare, early Mahāyāna sūtras on topics such as [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]], and meditation on the buddha [[Akshobhya|Akṣobhya]]. Lokaksema's translations continue to provide insight into the early period of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This corpus of texts often includes and emphasizes ascetic practices and forest dwelling, and absorption in states of meditative concentration:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' 2008. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Paul Harrison has worked on some of the texts that are arguably the earliest versions we have of the Mahāyāna sūtras, those translated into Chinese in the last half of the second century CE by the Indo-Scythian translator Lokakṣema. Harrison points to the enthusiasm in the Lokakṣema sūtra corpus for the extra ascetic practices, for dwelling in the forest, and above all for states of meditative absorption (''samādhi''). Meditation and meditative states seem to have occupied a central place in early Mahāyāna, certainly because of their spiritual efficacy but also because they may have given access to fresh revelations and inspiration.}}

Some scholars believe that the Mahāyāna ''[[Infinite Life Sutra|Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra]]'' was compiled in the age of the Kushan Empire in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, by an order of [[Mahisasaka|Mahīśāsaka]] [[bhikkhu|bhikṣus]] which flourished in the Gandhāra region.&lt;ref name="Nakamura, Hajime 1999. p. 205"&gt;Nakamura, Hajime. ''Indian Buddhism: A Survey With Biographical Notes.'' 1999. p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' 2008. p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is likely that the longer ''Sukhāvatīvyūha'' owes greatly to the [[Mahāsāṃghika]]-[[Lokottaravāda]] sect as well for its compilation, and in this sūtra there are many elements in common with the Lokottaravādin ''[[Mahavastu|Mahāvastu]]''.&lt;ref name="Nakamura, Hajime 1999. p. 205"/&gt; There are also images of [[Amitābha]] Buddha with the [[bodhisattva]]s [[Avalokiteśvara]] and [[Mahāsthāmaprāpta]] which were made in Gandhāra during the Kushan era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huntingtonarchive.osu.edu/studypages/internal/dl/SouthAsia/Buddhist/pgs/u5/DL0230m.htm|title=Gandharan Sculptural Style: The Buddha Image|access-date=7 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218045231/http://huntingtonarchive.osu.edu/studypages/internal/dl/SouthAsia/Buddhist/pgs/u5/DL0230m.htm|archive-date=18 December 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa'' records that Kaniṣka of the Kushan Empire presided over the establishment of the Mahāyāna [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]] teachings in the northwest.&lt;ref name="Ray, Reginald 1999. p. 410"&gt;Ray, Reginald. ''Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations.'' 1999. p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taranatha|Tāranātha]] wrote that in this region, 500 [[bodhisattva]]s attended the council at Jālandhra monastery during the time of Kaniṣka, suggesting some institutional strength for Mahāyāna in the northwest during this period.&lt;ref name="Ray, Reginald 1999. p. 410"/&gt; [[Edward Conze]] goes further to say that Prajñāpāramitā had great success in the northwest during the Kushan period, and may have been the "fortress and hearth" of early Mahāyāna, but not its origin, which he associates with the Mahāsāṃghika branch of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald. ''Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations.'' 1999. p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist translators===
Gandharan Buddhist missionaries were active, with other monks from Central Asia, from the 2nd century AD in the [[Han Dynasty|Han-dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD) at China's capital of [[Luoyang]], and particularly distinguished themselves by their translation work. They promoted scriptures from [[Early Buddhist schools]] as well as those from the Mahāyāna. These translators included:
* [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]], a [[Kushan]] and the first to translate Mahāyāna scriptures into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (167–186)
* [[Zhi Yao (monk)|Zhi Yao]] (c. 185), a Kushan monk, second generation of translators after Lokakṣema
* [[Zhi Qian]] (220–252), a Kushan monk whose grandfather had settled in China during 168–190
* [[Zhi Yue]] (c. 230), a Kushan monk who worked at [[Nanjing]]
* [[Dharmaraksa|Dharmarakṣa]] (265–313), a Kushan whose family had lived for generations at Dunhuang
* [[Jnanagupta|Jñānagupta]] (561–592), a monk and translator from Gandhāra
* [[Śikṣānanda]] (652–710), a monk and translator from [[Oddiyana|Oḍḍiyāna]], Gandhāra
* [[Prajna (Buddhist Monk)|Prajñā]] (c. 810), a monk and translator from [[Kabul]], who educated the Japanese [[Kūkai]] in Sanskrit texts

===Textual finds===
The Chinese Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] visited a Lokottaravāda monastery in the 7th century, at [[Bamiyan]], Afghanistan. The site of this monastery has since been rediscovered by archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Schøyen Collection: Buddhism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoyencollection.com/buddhism.html|title=Schøyen Collection: Buddhism|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birchbark]] and [[palm leaf manuscript]]s of texts in this monastery's collection, including Mahāyāna sūtras, have been discovered at the site, and these are now located in the [[Schoyen Collection|Schøyen Collection]]. Some manuscripts are in the Gāndhārī language and Kharoṣṭhī script, while others are in Sanskrit and written in forms of the [[Gupta script]]. Manuscripts and fragments that have survived from this monastery's collection include the following source texts:&lt;ref name="Schøyen Collection: Buddhism"/&gt;
* ''[[Pratimoksa|Pratimokṣa]] Vibhaṅga'' of the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda (MS 2382/269)
* ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta|Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'', a sūtra from the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]] (MS 2179/44)
* ''Caṃgī Sūtra'', a sūtra from the Āgamas (MS 2376)
* ''[[Diamond Sutra|Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]'', a Mahāyāna sūtra (MS 2385)
* ''[[Bhaisajyaguru|Bhaiṣajyaguru Sūtra]]'', a Mahāyāna sūtra (MS 2385)
* ''[[Śrīmālādevī Sūtra|Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]]'', a Mahāyāna sūtra (MS 2378)
* ''Pravāraṇa Sūtra'', a Mahāyāna sūtra (MS 2378)
* ''Sarvadharmapravṛttinirdeśa Sūtra'', a Mahāyāna sūtra (MS 2378)
* ''Ajātaśatrukaukṛtyavinodana Sūtra'', a Mahāyāna sūtra (MS 2378)
* ''Śāriputra Abhidharma Śāstra'' (MS 2375/08)

A Sanskrit manuscript of the ''Bhaiṣajyaguruvaiḍūryaprabhārāja Sūtra'' was among the textual finds at [[Gilgit]], Pakistan, attesting to the popularity of the [[Medicine Buddha]] in Gandhāra.&lt;ref name="Bakshi, S.R. 1998. p. 194"&gt;Bakshi, S.R. ''Kashmir: History and People.'' 1998. p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts in this find are dated before the 7th century, and are written in the upright Gupta script.&lt;ref name="Bakshi, S.R. 1998. p. 194"/&gt;

==Art==
[[File:HaddaTypes.JPG|thumb|Greco-Buddhist Portraits from the site of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], Gandhara, 3rd century, [[Guimet Museum]]]]

Gandhāra is noted for the distinctive '''Gandhāra style''' of [[Buddhist art]], which developed from a merger of Greek, Syrian, Persian, and local artistic influences. This development began during the Parthian Period (50 BC – AD 75). The Gandhāran style flourished and achieved its peak during the [[Kushan]] period, from the 1st to the 5th centuries. It declined and was destroyed after the invasion of the [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]] in the 5th century.

[[Stucco]] as well as stone was widely used by sculptors in Gandhara for the decoration of monastic and cult buildings. Stucco provided the artist with a medium of great plasticity, enabling a high degree of expressiveness to be given to the sculpture. Sculpting in stucco was popular wherever Buddhism spread from Gandhara – Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Central Asia, and China.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7979">'''Geoffrey Gaimar''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1130s),&lt;ref&gt;Ian Short, "Gaimar, Geffrei", [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10281 ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''], Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; also written Geffrei or Geoffroy Gaimar, was an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[chronicle]]r. His lasting contribution to medieval literature and history was as a translator from [[Old English language|Old English]] to [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. His [[Estoire des Engleis|''L'Estoire des Engleis'']], or ''History of the English People'', written between 1136 and 1140,&lt;ref name=keller/&gt; was a chronicle in eight-syllable rhyming couplets, running to 6,526 lines.&lt;ref name=keller/&gt;

==Overview of his work==
The [[Estoire des Engleis|''L'Estoire des Engleis'']] opens with a brief mention of [[King Arthur]], whose actions affect the plot of the interpolated tale of [[Havelok the Dane]]. That aside, most of the first 3,500 lines are translations out of a variant text of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and subsequent portions from other (Latin and French) sources that remain unidentified.&lt;ref name="keller"&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval France: An Encyclopedia |last=Keller |first=Hans-Erich |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1995 |isbn=0824044444 |editor-last=Kibler |editor-first=William W. |place=Manchester |page=388 |pages= |chapter=Geffrei Gaimar |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQoKeohhNkMC&amp;pg=PA741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaimar claims to have also written a version of the ''[[Brutus of Troy|Brut]]'' story, a translation of the chronicle of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] verse, which was commissioned about 1136 by Constance, wife of Ralph FitzGilbert, a [[Lincolnshire]] landowner.&lt;ref name=keller/&gt; Constance appears to have been implicated in the writing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berat|first1=Emma|title=The Patron and her Clerk: Multilingualism and Cultural Transition|journal=New Medieval literatures|date=2010|volume=12|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaimar's translation, if it existed, antedated [[Wace]]'s [[Normans|Norman]] ''Roman de Brut'' (c. 1155), but no copy of Gaimar's ''Brut'' (also known as ''L'Estoire des Bretuns'') has survived, being superseded by the latecomer.&lt;ref name=keller/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ritson |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Ritson |title=Ancient Engleish Metrical Romanceës |volume=1 |publisher=Nicol |year=1802 |page=lxxxviii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pg5MAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Ritson notes: "poet anterior to Wace, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Short argues that Gaimar's ''Estoire des Bretuns'' was no more than a short [[epitome]] of the pre-Arthurian section of Geoffrey of Monmouth's ''Historia Regum Britanniae'', which might explain why Wace's later, full translation of the text became more popular and ultimately superseded Gaimer's.&lt;ref&gt;Short, Ian R. "What was Gaimar's ''Estoire des Bretuns''?", in: Cultura Neolatina 71, 2011, pp. 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaimar did not create two separate and distinct chronicles, and the two ''estoires'' were merely the former and latter sections of a long-running history starting from the [[Argonauts]]' quest for the [[Golden Fleece]] to the reign of [[William II of England|William II "Rufus"]] (died 1100) that Gaimar set out to write.&lt;ref name=keller/&gt; Gaimar's scheme was greatly expanded in scope from the translation work on Geoffrey of Monmouth, the former part, which the patron had requested.&lt;ref name=keller/&gt; Ironically, it was solely the latter part covering the Anglo-Saxon period that was transmitted by later copyists, as a continuation to Wace. The scribe of one such copy, in a late 13th-century manuscript ([[British Library|B.L.]] Royal 13 A xx i), dubbed the portion with the title ''Estoire des Engles''.&lt;ref name=keller/&gt; The so-called "lost ''L'Estoire des Bretuns''" (History of the Britons) was an expedient term coined by 19th-century commentators.&lt;ref name=gollancz&gt;"Lestorie des Bretons" as spelt in: {{cite book |last=Israel |authorlink=Israel Gollancz |title=Hamlet in Iceland |place=London |publisher=David Nutt |year=1898 |page=lx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of [[Havelok the Dane]] occurs at the beginning of ''L'Estoire des Engles'', which must have originally been interpolated in between the history of the Britons and the history of the English,&lt;ref name=gollancz/&gt; serving as a bridge. Unlike the Middle English version of the legend, Gaimar's version connects Havelok to [[King Arthur]] (making Arthur responsible for destroying the Danish kingdom that Havelok was to inherit.&lt;ref&gt;vv.409-422, {{Harvnb|Hardy|Martin|1888-89|p.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;There is also an Anglo-Norman [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]] version, but that is considered to be later and derived from Gaimar.Cf. {{cite book |last=Fahnestock |authorlink=Edith |title=A study of the sources and composition of the old French Lai d'Haveloc |place=Jamaica, New York |publisher=The Marion Press |year=1915 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbBcAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Added to this is a mention of the sword Calibur&lt;ref&gt;v.46, {{Harvnb |Hardy |Martin |1888–89 |p.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Excalibur]]), demonstrating Gaimar's knowledge of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth|Galfridian]] legendary history that predated the advent of Wace's ''Brut''.

'''Gerald W. Wolff''' (born 1939) is [[professor emeritus]] at the [[University of South Dakota]], known for his specialization in the [[history]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], the [[American West]], and national politics.

==Background==

In 1969, Wolff received his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], [[Iowa]], and thereafter joined the USD faculty in [[Vermillion, South Dakota|Vermillion]] in southeastern [[South Dakota]]. He remained there until his retirement in the middle 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.usd.edu/content.php?catoid=3&amp;navoid=31|title=Catalog: Faculty|publisher=catalog.usd.edu|accessdate=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Wolff's doctoral [[dissertation]] is a study of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] of 1854, pushed to passage in the [[United States Senate]] by [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of [[Illinois]]. The act gave birth to the modern [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], formed to halt the spread of [[slavery]] in to the territories of the United States. In 1972, Wolf used his dissertation as the basis for his article, "Party and Section: The Senate and the Kansas-Nebraska Bill," published in ''Civil War History.''&lt;ref&gt;Gerald W. Wolff, "Party and Section: The Senate and the Kansas-Nebraska Bil;," ''Civil War History 18 (December 1972), pp. 293-311&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he turned his dissertation into the book entitled ''The Kansas-Nebraska Bill: Party, Section, and the Coming of the Civil War.''&lt;ref&gt;Gerald W. Wolff, "The Kansas-Nebraska Bill: Party, Section, and the Coming of the Civil War,'' [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]: Revisionist Press, 1977, 385 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly pursuits==

In 1970, Wolff's "Mark Hanna's Goal: American Harmony," a glimpse of [[Mark Hanna]], the U.S. Senator and campaign manager for presidential candidate [[William McKinley]] of [[Ohio]], was published by ''[[Ohio History]].''&lt;ref&gt;Gerald W. Wolff, "Mark Hanna's Goal: American Harmony," ''Ohio History,'' Vol. 79 (Summer-Autumn 1970), pp. 138-151&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Wolff joined colleague Joseph H. Cash in the publication of an ethno-historical work entitled ''Three Affiliated Tribes,'' a study of the cultural relationships among the [[Arikaras]], [[Hidatsa]]s, and [[Mandans]]. The book was the first ever published by the Institute of American Indian Studies at USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usd.edu/institute-of-american-indian-studies/overview.cfm |title=Institute of American Indian Studies, Overview: Our Future |publisher=usd.edu |accessdate=November 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110041919/http://www.usd.edu/institute-of-american-indian-studies/overview.cfm |archivedate=November 10, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two also collaborated on books published by the Indian Tribal Series of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]], including a study of the [[Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma|Ponca]], a tribe always at peace with the United States but forced against its wishes to inhabit [[Indian Territory]] when its lands were given to the [[Sioux Indians|Sioux]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cash and Gerald W. Wolff, ''The Ponca People'' ([[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]]: Indian Tribal Series, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The pair also completed a study of the [[Ottawa Indians|Ottawa]] of [[Oklahoma]]&lt;ref&gt;Joseph H. Cash and Gerald W. Wolff, ''The Ottawa People'' (Phoenix, Arizona: Indian Tribal Series), 1976&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Comanche]] of [[Texas]], the southwest and the southern [[Great Plains]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph H. Cash and Gerald W. Wolff, ''The Comanche People'' (Phoenix: Indian Tribal Series, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Wolff and Cash collaborated again on an article entitled "South Dakotans Remember the [[Great Depression]]."&lt;ref&gt;"South Dakotans Remember the Great Depression," ''South Dakota History'' (Vol 19, Summer 1989), pp. 30-36&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1975, Wolff edited ''The Civil War Diary of Arthur Calvin Mellette'' for the South Dakota State Historical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.paperbackswap.com/Civil-War-Diary-Gerald-W-Wolff/book/9994081926/|title=The Civil War Diary of Arthur Calvin Mellette|publisher=South Dakota State Historical Society, {{ISBN|99940-819-2-6}}
|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Mellette|Arthur Calvin Mellette]] fought with Company H of the Ninth [[Indiana]] Volunteers from 1864-1865. He was elected in 1885 as the last territorial governor, when the capital was placed in [[Huron, South Dakota|Huron]], South Dakota. He3 was elected as a Republican in 1889 as the first governor at statehood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sd.gov/archives/Data/military/civilwar.aspx|title=Civil War Collections|publisher=history.sd.gov|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolff also edited ''The Korean War Journal of Lloyd R. Moses.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usd.edu/library/upload/MosesLR.pdf |title=The Korean War Journal of Lloyd R. Moses |publisher=usd.edu |deadurl=yes |accessdate=September 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019212158/https://www.usd.edu/library/upload/MosesLR.pdf |archivedate=October 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former educator Lloyd Roosevelt Moses (1904–2000), a native of [[Fairfax, South Dakota|Fairfax]], South Dakota, served in both [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]] and attained the rank of major general in the [[United States Army]]. He was residing in Vermillion, South Dakota, when Wolff edited Moses's wartime diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/lrmoses.htm|title=Lloyd Roosevelt Moses|publisher=arlingtoncemetery.net|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Wolff published the article entitled "Father Sylvester Eisenman and Marty Mission" in ''South Dakota History.'' Eisenman (1891–1948), a [[Jesuit]] priest originally from [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]], Indiana, established in 1922 a [[boarding school]] among the [[Yankton Sioux]] tribe. This "Marty School" was located in [[Marty, South Dakota|Marty]] in [[Charles Mix County, South Dakota|Charles Mix County]] in southern South Dakota, and financed with assistance from the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Eisenman worked to expand and promote the school through publication of ''The Little Bronzed Angel,'' which informed donors of the progress of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usd.edu/library/upload/EisenmanS.pdf |title=Father Sylvester Eisenman Collection |publisher=[[Pierre, South Dakota]]: ''South Dakota History,'' Vol. 5, No. 4 (1975), pp. 360--389 |accessdate=December 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812123132/https://www.usd.edu/library/upload/EisenmanS.pdf |archivedate=August 12, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1981-2002, Wolff was the book review editor of ''South Dakota History'', the quarterly publication founded in 1970 by the South Dakota State Historical Society Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdshspress.com/index.php?view=1&amp;publication_id=11&amp;hxterala=hxterala&amp;action=910|title=South Dakota History|publisher=sdshspress.com|accessdate=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Wolff received the Robinson Award, the highest honor bestowed by the historical society for his effectivenss in assigning and editing the book reviews. The prize is named for two past directors of the society.&lt;ref&gt;"Announcements", ''South Dakota History,'' Vol. 32, No. 2 (Summer 2002), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

After Wolff retired from USD, he was from 1996-1999 an adjunct professor of history at the [[South Dakota School of Mines and Technology]] in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] in southwestern South Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;"Book Reviews," ''South Dakota History,'' Vol. 26, No. 1 (Spring 1996), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; For several years after 1999, he was a professor of history at [[Western Iowa Tech Community College]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]], Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;"Book Reviews," ''South Dakota History,'' Vol. 29, No. 2 (Summer 1999), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; He later moved to his current residence in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;Internet: People Search and Background Check&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GhostNet''' ({{zh|t=幽靈網|s=幽灵网|p=YōuLíngWǎng}}) is the name given by researchers at the [[Information Warfare Monitor]] to a large-scale [[cyber spying]]&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glaister|first=Dan|title=China Accused of Global Cyberspying|work=[[The Guardian Weekly]]|volume=180|issue=16|page=5|date=March 30, 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/30/china-dalai-lama-spying-computers|accessdate=April 7, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- correct print title --&gt; operation discovered in March 2009. The operation is likely associated with an [[Advanced Persistent Threat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Reverse Deception: Organized Cyber Threat Counter-Exploitation]] |author=Sean Bodmer |author2=Dr. Max Kilger |author3=Gregory Carpenter |author4=Jade Jones |year=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Osborne Media |isbn=978-0071772495}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its command and control infrastructure is based mainly in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and has infiltrated high-value political, economic and media locations&lt;ref name="nato"/&gt; in 103 countries. Computer systems belonging to [[embassy|embassies]], foreign ministries and other government offices, and the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]'s [[Tibet]]an exile centers in India, London and New York City were compromised.

==Discovery==
GhostNet was discovered and named following a 10-month investigation by the [[Infowar Monitor]] (IWM), carried out after IWM researchers approached the Dalai Lama's representative in Geneva&lt;ref name="Tracking_Ghostnet"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13731776/Tracking-GhostNet-Investigating-a-Cyber-Espionage-Network |title=Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; suspecting that their computer network had been infiltrated.&lt;ref name="BBC_3003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7972702.stm|title=China denies spying allegations|work=[[BBC News]]|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=March 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWM is composed of researchers from [[The SecDev Group]] and Canadian consultancy and the [[Citizen Lab]], [[Munk Centre for International Studies]] at the [[University of Toronto]]; the research findings were published in the ''Infowar Monitor'', an affiliated publication.&lt;ref name="NY-TIMES"&gt;{{cite news| title=Vast Spy System Loots Computers in 103 Countries | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/technology/29spy.html | work = [[New York Times]] | date=March 28, 2009 | accessdate=March 29, 2009 | first=John | last=Markoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory|Computer Laboratory]], supported by the [[Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection]],&lt;ref name="Cambridge_p2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-746.pdf|title=The snooping dragon: social-malware surveillance of the Tibetan movement|author=Shishir Nagaraja, Ross Anderson|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|date=March 2009|page=2|accessdate=March 31, 2009|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; also contributed to the investigation at one of the three locations in [[Dharamshala]], where the Tibetan government-in-exile is located.  The discovery of the 'GhostNet', and details of its operations, were reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' on March 29, 2009.&lt;ref name="NY-TIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Researchers: Cyber spies break into govt computers | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQLLlzAwWMnd6PID1d_id1LYOwfwD977GQ0G0 | work=[[Associated Press]] | date=March 29, 2009 | accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators focused initially on allegations of Chinese cyber-espionage against the [[Tibetan exile]] community, such as instances where email correspondence and other data were extracted.&lt;ref name=bp&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/138995/china-based-spies-target-us China-based spies target Thailand]. [[Bangkok Post]], March 30, 2009. Retrieved on March 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compromised systems were discovered in the [[Embassy|embassies]] of India, [[South Korea]], [[Indonesia]], [[Romania]], [[Cyprus]], [[Malta]], [[Thailand]], [[Taiwan]], [[Portugal]], Germany and Pakistan and the office of the Prime Minister of [[Laos]]. The [[Foreign ministry|foreign ministries]] of [[Iran]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Latvia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Philippines]], [[Brunei]], [[Barbados]] and [[Bhutan]] were also targeted.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news| title=Major cyber spy network uncovered | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7970471.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | date=March 29, 2009 | accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news| title=Canadians find vast computer spy network: report | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE52R2HQ20090328 | work=[[Reuters]] | date=March 28, 2009 | accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence was found that U.S. or UK government offices were infiltrated, although a [[NATO]] computer was monitored for half a day and the computers of the [[Embassy of India in Washington, D.C.|Indian embassy]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], were infiltrated.&lt;ref name="nato"&gt;{{cite news| title=Chinese hackers ‘using ghost network to control embassy computers’ | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5996253.ece | work=[[The Times]] | date=March 29, 2009 | accessdate=March 29, 2009 | location=London | first=Mike | last=Harvey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Spying operation by China infiltrated computers: Report | url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blnus/10291335.htm | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=March 29, 2009 | accessdate=March 29, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401191213/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blnus/10291335.htm | archivedate=April 1, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its discovery, GhostNet has attacked other government networks, for example Canadian official financial departments in early 2011, forcing them off-line. Governments commonly do not admit such attacks, which must be verified by official but anonymous sources.&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news| title=Foreign hackers attack Canadian government | url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2011/02/16/pol-weston-hacking.html | work=[[CBC News]] | date=February 17, 2011 | accessdate= February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical functionality==
Emails are sent to target organizations that contain contextually relevant information. These emails contain malicious attachments, that when opened, drop a Trojan horse on to the system. This Trojan connects back to a control server, usually located in China, to receive commands. The infected computer will then execute the command specified by the control server. Occasionally, the command specified by the control server will cause the infected computer to download and install a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] known as [[Gh0st Rat]] that allows attackers to gain complete, real-time control of computers running [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref name="nato"/&gt; Such a computer can be controlled or inspected by attackers, and the software even has the ability to turn on camera and audio-recording functions of infected computers, enabling monitors to perform surveillance.&lt;ref name="NY-TIMES"/&gt;

==Origin==
The researchers from the IWM stated they could not conclude that the Chinese government was responsible for the spy network.&lt;ref name=uoft/&gt; However, a report from researchers at the [[University of Cambridge]] says they believe that the Chinese government is behind the intrusions they analyzed at the Office of the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name=snoop&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-746.pdf | title = The snooping dragon: social-malware surveillance of the Tibetan movement | first = Shishir | last = Nagaraja |author2=Anderson, Ross| publisher = Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge | date = March 2009 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also noted the possibility that GhostNet was an operation run by private citizens in China for profit or for patriotic reasons, or created by intelligence agencies from other countries such as Russia or the United States.&lt;ref name="NY-TIMES"/&gt; The Chinese government has stated that China "strictly forbids any cyber crime."&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=bp/&gt;

The "Ghostnet Report" documents several unrelated infections at Tibetan-related organizations in addition to the Ghostnet infections. By using the email addresses provided by the IWM report, [[Scott J. Henderson]] had managed to trace one of the operators of one of the infections (non-Ghostnet) to [[Chengdu]]. He identifies the hacker as a 27-year-old man who had attended the [[University of Electronic Science and Technology of China]], and currently connected with the Chinese hacker [[Subculture|underground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Henderson|first=Scott|publication-date=April 2, 2009|title=Hunting the GhostNet Hacker|url=http://www.thedarkvisitor.com/2009/04/hunting-the-ghostnet-hacker/|publisher = The Dark Visitor|accessdate=April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of evidence to pinpoint the Chinese government as responsible for intrusions against Tibetan-related targets, researchers at Cambridge have found actions taken by Chinese government officials that corresponded with the information obtained via computer instrusions. One such incident involved a diplomat who was pressured by Beijing after receiving an email invitation to a visit with the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] from his representatives.&lt;ref name="snoop"/&gt;

Another incident involved a Tibetan woman who was interrogated by Chinese intelligence officers and was shown transcripts of her online conversations.&lt;ref name=uoft&gt;[http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/ghostnet.pdf Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network]. [[Munk Centre for International Studies]]. March 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/article/610071 U of T team tracks China-based cyber spies] [[Toronto Star]] March 29, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331165041/http://www.thestar.com/article/610071 |date=March 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are other possible explanations for this event. Drelwa uses QQ and other instant messengers to communicate with Chinese Internet users. In 2008, IWM found that TOM-Skype, the Chinese version of Skype, was logging and storing text messages exchanged between users. It is possible that the Chinese authorities acquired the chat transcripts through these means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nartv.org/mirror/breachingtrust.pdf BREACHING TRUST: An analysis of surveillance and security practices on China’s TOM-Skype platform]&lt;/ref&gt;

IWM researchers have also found that when detected, GhostNet is consistently controlled from IP addresses located on the island of [[Hainan]], China, and have pointed out that Hainan is home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People’s Liberation Army.&lt;ref name="nato"/&gt; Furthermore, one of GhostNet's four control servers has been revealed to be a government server.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/meet-the-canadians-who-busted-ghostnet/article732409/ Meet the Canadians who busted Ghostnet] ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''March 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Hakuhō period'''|白鳳時代|Hakuhō jidai|"white phoenix period"}} was an unofficial {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号|''nengō''|"year name"}} of [[Emperor Tenmu]]&lt;ref name="nussbaum280"&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Hakuhō''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 280|page=280}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt; after ''[[Hakuchi (era)|Hakuchi]]''&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, "''Hakuchi''" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 280.|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; and before ''[[Suchō]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, "''Shuchō''" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 889.|page=889}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The duration of this discrete non-''nengō'' timespan lasted from 673 through 686.&lt;ref name="nussbaum280"/&gt;

The Hakuhō period is more often used as a general term which describes a wider range of years.

==History of art==
Hakuhō is conventionally used to identify a broad historical and artistic period of the late seventh century and early eighth century.&lt;ref name="nussbaum280"/&gt;  The term is primarily used in art history and is thought to have been introduced at the 1910 [[Japan–British Exhibition]].&lt;ref name="janaas2001"&gt;[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/h/hakuhoujidai.htm  ''Hakuhou jidai'' 白鳳時代], [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/  JAANUS (Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System)]; retrieved 24 Jan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general historical contexts, the [[Asuka period]] is understood as overlapping the Hakuhō period; and the Hakuhō can be construed as having been followed by a Tempyō period in art history.&lt;ref name="nussbaum280"/&gt;  The Hakuhō period was marked by the rapid expansion of [[Buddhism]] and its dissemination throughout Japan. Artistically the period was influenced directly by the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties,&lt;ref name="janaas2001"/&gt; and influenced indirectly by [[Gupta Empire#Legacy of the Gupta Empire|Gupta art]] from India.&lt;ref name="nussbaum280"/&gt;

Beginning with the Taika Reforms, the period saw a shift towards more structured, more bureaucratic forms of government, based largely on Chinese models. The first "permanent" Imperial capital was established at [[Fujiwara-kyō]] in 694. Though the capital was moved again only sixteen years later, this represented an important step in the development of the Yamato state, the seat of power of which had been quite transitory and nomadic up until this point.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Penelope. (1993). ''History of Japanese Art,'' p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The decades of the Hakuhō period also saw many other major developments in political structure and in culture, including the introduction of writing and development of calligraphy in Japan. Chinese characters had been seen and used in Japan for centuries prior, but it was during the 7th century that, as one scholar describes it, "writing and the art of its production—or calligraphy—has a sudden and spectacular flowering".&lt;ref&gt;Mason, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and architecture===
The term "Hakuhō period" is chiefly applied in discussions of architecture, sculpture, and painting.

Hundreds of [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]] were built in the Hakuhō period, including [[Kawara-dera]], [[Daikandai-ji]] and [[Yakushi-ji]] in Fujiwara-kyō, in [[Sangharama|styles]] showing considerable [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty China]] influence. Wakakusa-dera, which had burnt down in 670, was also rebuilt at this time as [[Hōryū-ji]], showing the same stylistic influences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hanshin Electric Railway]] - Area Guide [http://www.hanshin.co.jp/global/en/guide/nara.html#kouen] "With the Tang Dynasty-style and Chinese western region-style designs seen in the platform for the image of Buddha in the Main Hall, Yakushi-ji Temple is regarded as the terminal point of the Silk Road."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mason. pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; When Baekje was ruined in 660, The refugee was naturalized in Japan. And they played a major role in designing and constructing these temples, and taught and trained their Japanese counterparts.

At the time, stone and bronze were the chief media used for Buddhist statues in Japan, and would remain so on the continent for quite some time to come;&lt;ref&gt;Morse, Anne Nishimura. "Art of the Temple". in ''mfa Highlights: Arts of Japan''. Boston: [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], 2008. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; however, in Japan, the wood carved statues which would come to dominate in later centuries began to appear as early as the Hakuhō period.

===Hōryū-ji===
The statues in Hōryū-ji serve as good examples of Hakuhō period sculpture; nearly all date to that period.&lt;ref name=Mason7780&gt;Mason, pp. 77-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Most are made of wood, with a single block used for the bodies, and separate blocks for secondary elements, such as demons upon which the deity treads, halos, and parts of the deities' skirts. All were originally painted and gilded, and bear rounder forms with a stronger impact of three-dimensionality than the Asuka period statues of earlier decades. In these aspects and others, they reflect strong stylistic influences from [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] China, and from the stylistic heritage of the [[Northern Qi]] and [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] Dynasties which came before.&lt;ref name=Mason7780/&gt; Another group of statues from the same temple show another important development, namely, the first use of lacquer not solely as a protective or decorative coating for statues, but as a material from which accessories, such as a [[bodhisattva]]'s jewellery, hair ornaments, and hair, might be made, to be attached onto the wooden sculpture.&lt;ref name=Mason7780/&gt;

A series of mural paintings on the walls of the ''kondō'' ("Golden Hall"; Main Hall) of Hōryū-ji, depicting various Buddhist figures, represent some of the best extant examples of Hakuhō period painting. Though a 1949 fire left most of the paintings blackened to the point of illegibility, the process can still be determined. Plaster was applied to the walls layer by layer, each layer increasingly fine. Once the plaster was dry, holes were punched in the preliminary sketches for the painting (known as a [[Cartoon#Fine art|cartoon]]), and colored sand or powder was applied, passing through the holes and sticking to the surface of the wall, providing an outline or rough guideline for the painter to then follow. These Hōryū-ji murals represent two painting elements distinctive of this period: the use of red rather than black to outline the figures and, on other sections, a consistent line lacking calligraphic flourish and known as "iron wire" line.&lt;ref name=Mason8283&gt;Mason, pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yakushi-ji===
Yakushi-ji was founded in the Hakuhō period&lt;ref name="janaas2001"/&gt; in 680.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, "''Yakushi-ji''" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 1035.|page=1035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
A number of Buddhist statues at Yakushi-ji temple are counted among the finest extant examples of Hakuhō period sculpture, reflecting the influence of Tang Chinese styles more strongly than their counterparts in Hōryū-ji.

A noteworthy {{nihongo|Yakushi Triad|薬師三尊|Yakushi sanzon}} consists of three sculptures representing the [[Yakushi]] Buddha and two bodhisattvas [[Suryaprabha|Nikkō]] and [[Candraprabha|Gakkō]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/n/nikkougakkou.htm  ''Nikkou Gakkou''　日光･月光], JAANUS; retrieved 24 Jan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  which are described as "full, fleshy figures conceived in the round and treated as completely natural forms".&lt;ref name=Mason8283/&gt;  These three figures were cast in bronze; and they were replaced in the [[Edo period]] after their destruction in earthquake or fire. The bodhisattvas are posed in the "hip-slung" ([[Sanskrit]]: ''[[tribhanga]]'') pose and other Chinese motifs including grape leaves and the [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Symbols of the Four Directions]] are prevalent.&lt;ref name=Mason8283/&gt;

Basque has borrowed during its [[history]] [[Loanword|loanwords]] and structures from neighbouring [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Latin]]/[[Romance languages]] ([[Stratum (linguistics)|adstratum]]), holding a dynamic interaction with them. Basque shows a receding geographical trend overall at least since the [[Early Middle Ages]]. During the last 400 years its geographical extent has been largely confined to seven districts, the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country (''Euskal Herria'')]]. 

Basque venturers [[History of the Basques#Masters of the ocean|took their language overseas]] since the 16th century, especially into the Americas, while it came to be diluted in the larger, prevailing colonial languages, like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], or [[English language|English]]. Basque remained until late-20th century a language steeped in oral tradition and little use in writing, with its first written book attested in 1545, the ''[[Bernard Etxepare#Linguæ Vasconum Primitiæ|Linguae Vasconum Primitiae]]''. Basque was never used for official documents, and came to be gradually excluded as an oral communication language from governing, educative, administrative bodies, and finally also from Church. During 20th century, scholars, writers and activists endevoured to develop a long-discussed aspiration to create an unified, formal standard, which finally crystallized in [[Standard Basque|standard Basque (''euskara batua'')]] as of 1968.

[[File:Lazio Roma Gesu2 tango7174.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Triumph of the Name of Jesus'', by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]], on the ceiling of the [[Church of the Gesu]]. The decorations of the vault over the nave date back to the 17th century. The fresco is the work of Giovanni Battista Gaulli, known as Baciccia. The stucco reliefs were executed by Ercole Antonio Raggi and Leonardo Reti, following the drawings of Baciccia who wanted to effect a real continuity between painting and sculpture.]]

'''Illusionism''' in [[art history]] means either the artistic tradition in which artists create a work of art that appears to share the physical space with the viewer&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;"Illusionism," ''Grove Art Online''. [[Oxford University Press]], [accessed 17 March 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; or more broadly the attempt to represent physical appearances precisely – also called [[mimesis]].  The term [[realism (art)|realist]] may be used in this sense, but that also has rather different meanings in art, as it is also used to cover the choice of ordinary everyday subject-matter, and avoiding idealizing subjects. Illusionism encompasses a long history, from the deceptions of [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]] to the works of [[mural]]ist [[Richard Haas]] in the twentieth century, that includes [[trompe-l'oeil]], [[anamorphosis]], [[Op art]], [[Abstract Illusionism]], and [[Illusionistic ceiling painting]] techniques such as ''di sotto in sù'' and ''quadratura''.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; [[sculpture|Sculptural]] illusionism includes works, often painted, that appear real from a distance.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; Other forms, such as the [[illusionistic tradition]] in the theatre, and [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]]'s "peepshow"-boxes from the seventeenth century, combine illusionistic techniques and media. 

==Illusionistic realism==

[[File:Frederic Leighton - Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|left|340px|[[Lord Leighton]]'s ''Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession'' of 1853-55 is at the end of a long tradition of illusionism in painting, but is not Realist in the sense of Courbet's work of the same period.]]
The development of increasingly accurate representation of the visual appearances of things has a long history in art. It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and beasts, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of beasts, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.

[[File:Camera picta, ceiling 3.jpg|alt=Illusionistic ceiling fresco by Andrea Mantegna in the Camera degli Sposi, Ducal Palace, Mantua|left|thumb|[[Andrea Mantegna]]'s late-[[Quattrocento]] ceiling fresco in the ''[[Camera degli Sposi]]''  (commissioned by [[Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua|Ludovico III Gonzaga]] for Mantua's Ducal Palace) is an early example of [[illusionistic ceiling painting]].]]
The art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] or [[Early Renaissance]] period, and were helped by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, idealism remained the norm.

The accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish and Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked "realism", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquet]]s in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].

==Donald Judd==


In his writings and art criticisms during the mid-1960s [[art critic]]/artist [[Donald Judd]] claimed that illusionism in painting undermined the artform itself. Judd implied that painting was dead, claiming painting was a ''lie'' because it depicted the ''illusion'' of three-dimensionality on a flat surface. Judd claimed that painting needed to recognize its objecthood in real space and reject illusion. Donald Judd wrote in “Specific Objects” in 1965:
{{quote|Three dimensions are real space. That gets rid of the problem of illusionism and of literal space, space in and around marks of color… Actual space is intrinsically more powerful and specific than paint on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2011/07/artseen/donald-judd Greg Lindquist, The Brooklyn Rail, ''Donald Judd'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Modern Illusion==
In the Webster Texas Holiday Inn, close to the Houston Space Center, there is a double illusion ceiling by muralist Frank Wilson, commissioned in honor of US astronauts. Other double illusion murals exist in rooms for officials as well as the dining room, depicting a night sky under darkness and illuminated by glowing minerals.  Under normal light, clouds and birds are observed.

The '''International Council on Monuments and Sites''' ('''ICOMOS'''; {{lang-fr|links=no|Conseil international des monuments et des sites}}) is a professional association that works for the conservation and protection of cultural heritage places around the world. Now headquartered in Paris, ICOMOS was founded in 1965 in [[Warsaw]] as a result of the [[Venice Charter]] of 1964, and offers advice to [[UNESCO]] on [[World Heritage Site]]s.

The idea behind ICOMOS dates to the Athens Conference on the restoration of historic buildings in 1931, organized by the International Museums Office. The [[Athens Charter (Preservation)|Athens Charter]] of 1931 introduced the concept of international heritage. In 1964, the Second Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings, meeting in [[Venice]], adopted 13 resolutions. The first created the International Charter on the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites, better known as [[Venice Charter]]; the second, put forward by [[UNESCO]], created ICOMOS to carry out this charter.

ICOMOS currently has over 9,500 individual members in 144 countries, 110 national committees and 28 international scientific committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Introducing ICOMOS – International Council on Monuments and Sites|url = http://www.icomos.org/index.php/en/about-icomos/mission-and-vision/mission-and-vision|website = www.icomos.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With rare exceptions, each member must be qualified in the field of conservation and a practicing landscape architect, architect, archaeologist, anthropologist, town planner, engineer, administrator of heritage, historian, art historian, [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] or [[archive|archivist]].

ICOMOS is a partner in the [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]] (ICBS), which works to protect the world's cultural heritage threatened by wars and natural disasters.

==ICOMOS structure==
ICOMOS is composed of its national committees (NCs), to which individuals and institutions apply for membership. In addition to the national committees, ICOMOS has a series of international scientific committees (ISCs), in which experts in a certain field of activity within the context of heritage conservation exchange views and debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/publications/EN_Statuts_1978_20110301.pdf |title=ICOMOS Statutes, adopted by the Vth General Assembly on 22 May 1978 in Moscow |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is headed by a president, five vice-presidents, a secretary-general and a treasurer all directly elected by the general assembly of the organization. 12 additional members are also elected by the [http://www.international.icomos.org/en/about-icomos/governance/general-information-about-the-general-assembly General Assembly] into the [http://www.international.icomos.org/en/about-icomos/governance/general-information-about-the-executive-committee Executive Committee] and five further members are co-opted into the executive board in order to represent regions of the world or areas of expertise that were not part of the executive committee following the elections. ''Ex officio'' members of the executive committee are the president of the [http://www.international.icomos.org/en/about-icomos/governance/general-information-on-the-advisory-committee advisory committee] and the previous presidents of ICOMOS, who attend in advisory capacity. The executive committee is the executive body of ICOMOS.

The [http://www.international.icomos.org/en/about-icomos/governance/general-information-on-the-advisory-committee advisory committee] is composed of the chairpersons of the national committees, the chairpersons of the international scientific committees and the president of ICOMOS as an ''ex officio'' member.&lt;ref&gt;Article 12, ICOMOS Statutes, adopted by the Vth General Assembly on 22 May 1978 in Moscow&lt;/ref&gt; The advisory committee was given the task to advise and make recommendations to the General Assembly and the Executive Committee on matters which concern policy and programme priorities.

===National committees===
National committees are subsidiary organizations created in the countries which are members of UNESCO. They bring together individual and institutional members and offer them a framework for discussion and an exchange of information. ICOMOS has national committees in 108 countries as of August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icomos.org/images/DOCUMENTS/Secretariat/Adresses/adresses-cn.pdf |title=Members of the Advisory Committee |publisher=International.icomos.org |accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each national committee adopts its own rules of procedure and elaborates its own program according to the goals and aims of ICOMOS.

===International committees===
&lt;ref&gt;Article 14, ICOMOS Statutes, adopted by the Vth General Assembly on 22 May 1978 in Moscow&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually known as "international scientific committees" (ISCs), these entities focus on specialised areas of heritage conservation and are made up of members of the organisation drawn from those specialist areas.  The scientific programmes of the organisation are coordinated by the 'scientific council" made up of the presidents of the ISCs. The following ISCs operate within ICOMOS:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of International Scientific Committees|url=http://icomos.org/en/network/international-scientific-committees/list-of-international-scientific-committees|publisher=ICOMOS|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICOMOS charters and doctrinal texts==
In the tradition of the Athens and Venice Charters, ICOMOS has in the years since its formation developed and adopted a number of other charters and doctrinal texts which provide guidance to heritage conservation professionals in their work.  Most such documents are created by the international committees of the organisation and thereafter adopted by the triennial General Assembly. The texts each address a specific area of professional practice in the heritage conservation professions. Following the 17th ICOMOS General Assembly held in Paris in November 2011, the list of charters is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icomos.org/en/what-we-do/involvement-in-international-conventions/standards ICOMOS Charters and Other Doctrinal Texts].

Many of the national committees of ICOMOS have adopted their own charters which set standards for heritage conservation practice at national level.&lt;ref name=icmos&gt;{{cite web|title=CHARTERS ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF ICOMOS|url=http://icomos.org/en/charters-and-texts|publisher=ICOMOS|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICOMOS and the World Heritage Convention==
In 1972, ICOMOS was named by the UNESCO [[World Heritage Convention]] as one of the three formal advisory bodies to the World Heritage Committee, along with the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM). As the professional and scientific adviser to the committee on all aspects of the cultural heritage, ICOMOS is responsible for the evaluation of all nominations of cultural properties made to the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] with the criteria laid down by the [[World Heritage Committee]]. In addition to the basic criterion of “outstanding universal value,” ICOMOS evaluates nominations for aspects related to authenticity, management, and conservation as specified in the World Heritage Convention.

The evaluation of nominations involves consultation between the wide-ranging expertise represented by the organization’s membership and its national and scientific committees. Members are also sent on expert missions to carry out on-site evaluations of nominated properties. This extensive consultation results in the preparation of detailed recommendations that are submitted to the World Heritage Committee at its annual meetings.

ICOMOS is also involved, through its International Secretariat and its national and scientific committees, in the preparation of reports on the state of conservation of properties inscribed on the World Heritage List. It advises the [http://whc.unesco.org/ UNESCO World Heritage Centre] on requests for technical assistance received from states that are party to (i.e. have ratified) the World Heritage Convention. ICOMOS maintains a full archive of nominations and reports at the documentation centre at its Paris headquarters.

===Nara Document on Authenticity===
In November 1994, at the [[Nara, Japan|Nara]] Conference on Authenticity, ICOMOS published the [[Nara Document on Authenticity]], which addresses the need for a broader understanding of cultural diversity and cultural heritage in [[conservation and restoration|conservation]] efforts involving cultural heritage sites.&lt;ref&gt;

== Piero Gazzola award ==
In 1979, ICOMOS instituted its highest award, named after its first president, Piero Gazzola, to laud the life-time achievements of one of its members. The prize is awarded every three years, and comprises a commemorative medal, a diploma and 10,000 US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Awards, honors &amp; prizes: International and foreign|page=312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbiKlgGo4NEC|volume=2|year=2001|publisher=Gale Group|isbn=978-0-7876-3405-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Architecture of Italy}}
'''Italian Baroque architecture''' refers to [[baroque architecture]] in [[Italy]].

==Central Italy==
===Rome===
[[File:Palazzo Barberini at night.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Palazzo Barberini]] at night.]]
The sacred architecture of the Baroque period had its beginnings in the Italian [[paradigm]] of the [[basilica]] with [[crossed dome]] and [[nave]]. One of the first Roman structures to break with the [[Mannerist]] conventions exemplified in [[Church of the Gesu|the Gesù]], was the church of [[Santa Susanna]], designed by [[Carlo Maderno]] in 1596. The dynamic rhythm of columns and pilasters, central massing, and the protrusion and condensed central decoration add complexity to the structure. There is an incipient playfulness with the rules of classic design, still maintaining rigor. They had domed roofs.

The same emphasis on plasticity, continuity and dramatic effects is evident in the work of [[Pietro da Cortona]], illustrated by [[San Luca e Santa Martina]] (1635) and [[Santa Maria della Pace]] (1656). The latter building, with concave wings devised to simulate a theatrical set, presses forward to fill a tiny piazza in front of it. Other Roman ensembles of the period are likewise suffused with theatricality, dominating the surrounding cityscape as a sort of theatrical environment.

Probably the best known example of such an approach is trapezoidal [[Saint Peter's Square]], which has been praised as a masterstroke of Baroque theatre. The square is shaped by two colonnades, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] on an unprecedented colossal scale to suit the space and provide emotions of awe. Bernini's own favourite design was the polychromatic oval church of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]] (1658), which, with its lofty altar and soaring dome, provides a concentrated sampling of the new architecture. His idea of the Baroque townhouse is typified by the [[Palazzo Barberini]] (1629) and [[Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi]] (1664), both in Rome.

[[File:RomaSIvoSapienzaCupola.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]]: [[Francesco Borromini]]]]

Bernini's chief rival in the papal capital was [[Francesco Borromini]], whose designs deviate from the regular compositions of the ancient world and Renaissance even more dramatically. Acclaimed by later generations as a revolutionary in architecture, Borromini condemned the anthropomorphic approach of the 16th century, choosing to base his designs on complicated geometric figures (modules). Borromini's architectural space seems to expand and contract when needed, showing some affinity with the late style of [[Michelangelo]]. His iconic masterpiece is the diminutive church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]], distinguished by a corrugated oval plan and complex convex-concave rhythms. A later work, [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]], displays the same antipathy to the flat surface and playful inventiveness, epitomized by a corkscrew lantern dome.

Following the death of Bernini in 1680, [[Carlo Fontana]] emerged as the most influential architect working in [[Rome]]. His early style is exemplified by the slightly concave façade of [[San Marcello al Corso]]). Fontana's academic approach, though lacking in the dazzling inventiveness of his Roman predecessors, exerted substantial influence on Baroque architecture both through his prolific writings and through a number of architects whom he trained and who would disseminate the Baroque idioms throughout 18th-century Europe.

The 18th century saw the capital of Europe's architectural world transferred from Rome to [[Paris]]. The Italian [[Rococo]], which flourished in Rome from the 1720s onward, was profoundly influenced by the ideas of Borromini. The most talented architects active in Rome — [[Francesco de Sanctis (architect)|Francesco de Sanctis]] ([[Spanish Steps]], 1723) and [[Filippo Raguzzini]] ([[Piazza Sant'Ignazio]], 1727) — had little influence outside their native country, as did numerous practitioners of the [[Sicilian Baroque]], including [[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]], [[Andrea Palma]], and [[Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia]].

==Southern Italy==

===Naples===
[[File:Reggia di Caserta.png|right|200px|thumb|The Baroque [[Palace of Caserta]] in [[Caserta]], near Naples.]]
The last phase of Baroque architecture in Italy is exemplified by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]]'s [[Caserta Palace]], reputedly the largest building erected in Europe in the 18th century. Indebted to contemporary French and Spanish models, the palace is skillfully related to the landscape. At Naples and Caserta, Vanvitelli practiced a sober classicizing academic style, with equal attention to [[aesthetics]] and engineering, a style that would make an easy transition to [[Neoclassicism]].

===Sicily===
{{main|Sicilian Baroque}}
[[File:Duomo San Giorgio.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The baroque Duomo of San Giorgio in [[Ragusa, Italy]], on the island of Sicily.]]
[[Sicilian Baroque]] is the distinctive form of [[Baroque architecture]] that took hold on the island of [[Sicily]], off the southern coast of Italy, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The style is recognizable not only by its typical Baroque curves and flourishes, but also by its grinning [[mask]]s and [[putto|putti]] and a particular flamboyance that has given Sicily a unique architectural identity.

The Sicilian Baroque style came to fruition during a major surge of rebuilding following a massive [[1693 Sicily earthquake|earthquake in 1693]]. Previously, the Baroque style had been used on the island in a naïve and [[parochialism|parochial]] manner, having evolved from [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural [[engraving]]s that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence in their use of the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly-fashionable [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]].

The highly decorative Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, and perfectly reflected the [[social order]] of the island at a time when, nominally ruled by Spain, it was in fact governed by a wealthy and often extravagant [[aristocracy]] into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural character that has lasted into the 21st century.

==North Italy==

===Turin===
[[File:Mg-k Basilica Superga1.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Basilica di Superga near [[Turin]]: [[Filippo Juvarra]]]]
In the north of Italy, notably [[Turin]], the monarchs from the [[House of Savoy]] were particularly receptive to the new style. They employed a brilliant triad of architects—[[Guarino Guarini]], [[Filippo Juvarra]] and [[Bernardo Vittone]]—to illustrate the grandiose political ambitions and the newly acquired royal status of their dynasty.

Guarini was a peripatetic monk who combined many traditions (including that of [[Gothic architecture]]) to create irregular structures remarkable for their oval columns and unconventional façades. Building upon the findings of contemporary geometry and [[stereotomy (architecture)|stereotomy]], Guarini elaborated the concept of ''architectura obliqua'', which approximated Borromini's style in both theoretical and structural audacity. Guarini's [[Palazzo Carignano]] (1679) may have been the most flamboyant application of the Baroque style to the design of a private house in the 17th century.

Fluid forms, weightless details and airy prospects of Juvarra's architecture anticipated the art of [[Rococo]]. Although his practice ranged well beyond [[Turin]], Juvarra's most arresting designs were created for [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia]]. The visual impact of his [[Basilica di Superga]] (1717) derives from its soaring roofline and masterful placement on a hill above Turin. Rustic ambience encouraged a freer articulation of architectural form at the royal hunting lodge of the [[Palazzina di Stupinigi]] (1729). Juvarra finished his short but eventful career in Madrid, where he worked on the royal palaces at [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]] and [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Aranjuez]].

Among the many who were profoundly influenced by the brilliance and diversity of Juvarra and Guarini none was more important than [[Bernardo Vittone]]. This Piedmontese architect is remembered for an outcrop of flamboyant [[Rococo]] churches, quatrefoil in plan and delicate in detailing. His sophisticated designs often feature multiple vaults, structures within structures and domes within domes.

===Milan===
[[File:IMG 4512 - Milano - Palazzo Litta - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 20-jan 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The baroque [[Palazzo Litta]] in Milan.]]
[[Francesco Maria Richini]] (1584-1658) was the most important [[Milan]]ese architect.&lt;ref name="Diz"&gt;N. Pevsner, J. Fleming, H. Honour, ''Dizionario di architettura'', cit., voce ''Richini, Francesco Maria''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1607 and 1630 he built the Church of [[San Giuseppe (Milan)|San Giuseppe]], which, like [[Chiesa del Gesù]] in Rome, was meant to practice the excess over the Mannerist academic vogue until then.&lt;ref name="Diz"/&gt;
Richini introduced a combined plan, consisting of two central areas derived from Chiesa di [[Sant'Alessandro in Zebedia|Sant' Alessandro]], also in Milan; the plastic effect is also noticeable in the façade, decorated by a series of overlapping niches.

Subsequently, in 1627 he devoted himself to the façade of the [[Palazzo del Senato (Milan)|Collegio Elvetico]] (now the seat of ''Archivio di Stato''), where he aimed at an integration between the interior and exterior through a concave prospectus. This interesting solution, possibly the first curved façade of the Baroque period, predates certain themes later expressed by Borromini, and confirms Richini as one of the greatest architects of the early Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;C. Norberg - Schulz, ''Architettura Barocca'', cit., p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venice===
[[Image:Venedig s maria della salut.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute]], [[Venice]]]]

The Venetian Baroque, according to local practice,&lt;ref&gt;C. Norberg - Schulz, ''Architettura Barocca'', cit., p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; saw Baldassarre Longhena (1598–1682) as its principal exponent.&lt;ref&gt;N. Pevsner, J. Fleming, H. Honour, ''Dizionario di architettura'', cit., voce ''Longhena, Baldassarre''.&lt;/ref&gt; After the pestilence of 1630, he began the construction of the Church of Santa Maria della Salute, using a central plan. In the octagonal body of the basilica, Longhena added a sanctuary bordered on either side by two apses, similar to that adopted by [[Andrea Palladio]] in the Basilica del Santissimo Redentore; this solution strengthens the longitudinal axis of the temple, which in fact became the central body in the proper nave. The baroque style of the temple is evident in the conformation of the external mass, located along the Grand Canal: the octagonal body, covered by a large dome, is flanked by the crown of the shrine and two bell towers.

Longhena also worked within civic architecture: its [[Ca' Pesaro]] presents a seemingly conventional plan, but the play of light and shadows that are set on the richly ornate façade leads to a typically Baroque style.

In any case, the exasperation of Loghena's [[plastic arts|plastic art details]] peaked in the façade of Chiesa dell'Ospedaletto (completed in the 1670s), decorated with a fancifully and richly with atlantes, giant heads and lion masks.

===Genoa===
In Genoa, Baroque architecture, since the end of the 16th century, saw the construction of a series of large buildings that critics have deemed among the most important of the Italian landscape.&lt;ref&gt;N. Pevsner, J. Fleming, H. Honour, ''Dizionario di architettura'', cit., voce ''Italia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was the [[Palazzo Doria Tursi]], where the planimetric configuration of the vestibule, combined with the highest indoor garden through a wide staircase, declares the presence of a movement in depth.

This solution was taken up by [[Bartolomeo Bianco]] (1590 - 1657) in what may be considered his masterpiece:&lt;ref&gt;C. Norberg - Schulz, ''Architettura Barocca'', cit., p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; the college of the Jesuits, which later became the headquarters of the [[University of Genoa]] (1634, approximately). The building has a U-shaped plan, but compared to previous one shows greater permeability between the inside and the yard; in fact, using the conformation of the very steep terrain, Bianco created a unique urban scenery, with a porch as wide as the yard and a series of overlapping arches and stairways.

'''Italian ballet''' is the training methods{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and aesthetic qualities seen in [[classical ballet]] in Italy. Ballet has a long history in Italy, and it is widely believed that the earliest predecessor of modern-day ballet originated in the Italian courts of the Renaissance. Two predominant training systems are used to teach Italian ballet today: the [[Cecchetti method]], devised by [[Enrico Cecchetti]], and that of the [[La Scala Theatre Ballet School]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== History (origins of ''il ballo'', or ballet) ==
Ballet began during the [[Italian Renaissance]] court as an outgrowth of court pageantry,&lt;ref&gt;Kirstein (1952), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/balt/hd_balt.htm|title=The Ballet|work=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; where aristocratic weddings were lavish celebrations. Court musicians and dancers collaborated to provide elaborate entertainment for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelminn.net/andros/index.php?de_medici_catherine|title=Andros on Ballet - Catherine Medici De|work=michaelminn.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209205503/http://www.michaelminn.net/andros/index.php?de_medici_catherine|archivedate=2008-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ballet was further shaped by the French ''ballet de cour'', which consisted of social dances performed by the nobility in tandem with music, speech, verse, song, pageant, decor and costume.&lt;ref&gt;Bland (1976), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Catherine de' Medici]], an Italian aristocrat with an interest in the arts, married the French crown heir Henry II, she brought her enthusiasm for dance to France and provided financial support. These glittering entertainments supported the aims of court politics and usually were organized around mythological themes.&lt;ref&gt;Frances A. Yates, _The French Academies of the Sixteenth Century_, 2nd ed. (London: Routledge, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

A ballet of the Renaissance was a far cry from the form of theatrical entertainment known to audiences today. [[Tutu (ballet)|Tutus]], ballet slippers and pointe work were not yet used. The choreography was adapted from court dance steps.&lt;ref&gt;Thoinot Arbeau, _Orchesography_, trans. by Mary Steware Evans, with notes by Julia Sutton (New York: Dover, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Performers dressed in fashions of the times. For women that meant formal gowns that covered their legs to the ankle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story/content/chronicle/ae/books/9798/05/03/greskovicch1.html |title=BALLET 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving the Ballet by Robert Greskovic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early ballet was participatory, with the audience joining the dance towards the end.

[[Domenico da Piacenza]] was one of the first dancing masters. Along with his students, [[Antonio Cornazzano]] and [[Guglielmo Ebreo]], he was trained in dance and responsible for teaching nobles the art. Da Piacenza left one work: '' De arte saltandi et choreus ducendi'' (On the art of dancing and conducting dances), which was put together by his students.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2002), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballet, if not the first, produced and shown was Baldassare de Belgiojoso's balletto comico, also known as [[Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx]]'s [[Ballet Comique de la Reine]] (1581) and was a [[ballet comique]] (ballet drama).&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1992), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the publication of [[Fabritio Caroso]]'s ''Il Ballarino'', a technical manual on court dancing, both performance and social, helped to establish [[Italy]] as a centre of technical ballet development.

At first, ballets were woven in to the midst of an opera to allow the audience a moment of relief from the dramatic intensity. By the mid-seventeenth century, Italian ballets in their entirety were performed in between the acts of an opera.&lt;ref&gt;Homans (2010), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Italian ballets became a more beloved and important part of theatrical life: ballet companies in Italy's major opera houses employed an average of four to twelve dancers; in 1815 many companies employed anywhere from eighty to one hundred dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Hansell (1980), Opera and Ballet, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Corona Núñez''' (July 4, 1906 – January 6, 2002) was a Mexican author, anthropologist, and history professor who discovered several important archeological sites throughout [[Mexico|México]].  His main body of work revolved around his native state of [[Michoacán]], and in particular the Tarascan or [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] culture.

== Early life ==
José Corona Núñez was born in [[Cuitzeo|Cuitzeo del Porvenir]] on July 4, 1906.  His father was Marcelino Corona García and his mother was María del Pilar Núñez Berrospe.  From an early age he attended the Agustino Convent of [[Cuitzeo]] and helped with the various common rituals.  
 
== Education and religious studies ==
Through his involvement with the convent Corona Núñez decided to pursuit priesthood.  He would later clarify that his primary motivation was to continue to learn and given his family's limited resources private schooling was not an option.  In January 1920 he began his seminary studies in the San Pablo Convent of [[Yuriria]], Guanajuato.  There he studied Latin, Greek, French, Grammar, Religion, and Mexican history, amongst other topics.  He then moved to another convent in [[San Luis Potosí]] to continue his studies as a [[Hermit]] and continue his studies.  On October 2, 1923, at the age of 17, he became Friar Angel in the [[Order of Saint Augustine]].  However, the following year he resigned by mailing a letter to the Prior General in Rome asking for his removal.  The last religious ceremony in which he participated took place in his native convent of [[Cuitzeo]] in which he was disrobed and he removed all emblems (belt, cross, etc.) and signed a document addressed to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] declaring the acknowledgement of his request, on April 5, 1926.

== Career ==
Corona Núñez received a scholarship to attend the [[National School of Anthropology and History]] ("Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia").  As a student he worked with [https://www.britannica.com/contributor/Donald-Dilworth-Brand/355 Donald D. Brand] in his work "Quiroga, A Mexican Municipio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://amzn.com/125862589X |title=Quiroga: A Mexican Municipio |author=Donald Dilworth Brand |isbn=9781258625894 |website=Amzn.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his studies he became a rural teacher and eventually director of various primary schools throughout [[Michoacan]].  He later became Director of the Anthropology Department of the State of [[Nayarit]], founded the Anthropology Museums of Tepic and Colima, and was in charge of the Anthropology Department of the [[Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo|University of Michoacan]].

As an anthropologist José Corona Núnez discovered the circular pyramid of the [[Ixtlán del Rio (archaeological site)|Ixtlán del Rio]] archeological site.

== Bibliography ==
José Corona Núnez created more than 100 articles and published more than a dozen books &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Jos%C3%A9+Corona+N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez%22] {{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3014">[[Image:Salmon - Boaz - Obed.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''Salmon-Boaz-Obed''.  Boaz is generally seen as the old man on the right with Ruth on the left and the infant Obed on her knee.]]
'''Matthew 1:5''' is the fifth verse of the [[Matthew 1]] of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]]. The verse is part of the section where the [[genealogy]] of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], the legal father of [[Jesus]], is listed.

==Description==
In the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]] the text reads:
:And [[Salmon (biblical figure)|Salmon]] begat [[Boaz|Booz]] of [[Rahab|Rachab]];
:and Booz begat [[Obed (biblical figure)|Obed]] of [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]];
:and Obed begat [[Jesse]];

The [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab.
:Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth.
:Obed became the father of Jesse.

==Analysis==
This genealogy matches that given in several other places in the Bible, including [[Luke 3:32]]. It covers the period after the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] to around the founding of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]]. The passage carries the genealogy through [[Salmon (Bible)|Salmon]], Boaz, Obed, and Jesse of which only Boaz is notable. It also mentions two women, Rahab and Ruth, both of whom are prominent [[Old Testament]] figures. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} ''For a full discussion of the women mentioned in Matthew's genealogy see [[Matthew 1:3]]''.

[[William F. Albright]] and C.S. Mann note that the author of Matthew spells Rahab's name as ''Rachab'', a departure from the [[Septuagint]] spelling Matthew usually uses. The ''Rachab'' form also appears in the works of [[Josephus]]. They speculate that this indicates a change in pronunciation during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Albright|Albright, W.F.]] and C.S. Mann. "Matthew." ''[[The Anchor Bible Series]].'' New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem, pointed out by [[Raymond E. Brown]], is that Rahab's position in this verse does not meet other traditions. No other source has her marrying Salmon and giving birth to Boaz. Jewish tradition has her as the wife of [[Joshua]], and thus, also in a different time period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond E. Brown|Brown, Raymond E.]] ''The Birth of the Messiah: A Commentary on the Infancy Narratives in Matthew and Luke''. London: G. Chapman, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26664">'''Mesoamerican architecture''' is the set of [[architecture|architectural]] traditions produced by [[pre-Columbian]] cultures and civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], traditions which are best known in the form of public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures. The distinctive features of Mesoamerican architecture encompass a number of different regional and historical styles, which however are significantly interrelated. These styles developed throughout the different phases of [[Mesoamerican chronology|Mesoamerican history]] as a result of the intensive cultural exchange between the different cultures of the Mesoamerican culture area through thousands of years. Mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for its [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] which are the largest such structures (outside of [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Chola Empire]]).

One interesting and widely researched topic is the relation between [[Cosmology|cosmovision]], [[religion]], [[geography]], and [[architecture]] in Mesoamerica. Much seems to suggest that many traits of Mesoamerican architecture were governed by religious and mythological ideas. For example, the layout of most Mesoamerican cities seem to be influenced by the [[cardinal directions]] and their [[Mythology|mythological]] and [[symbol]]ic meanings in Mesoamerican culture.

Another part of Mesoamerican architecture is its [[iconography]]. The monumental architecture of Mesoamerica was decorated with images of religious and cultural significance, and also in many cases with writing in some of the [[Mesoamerican writing systems]]. Iconographic decorations and texts on buildings are important contributors to the overall current knowledge of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican society, history and religion.

==Urban planning and cosmovision==

===Cosmos and its replication===

====Symbolism====
[[Image:Teotihuacancityplan.png|300px|left|thumb|The layout of the city of Teotihuacan. The central part of the city is laid out following a north/south axis aligned about 15.5 degrees off, and which is marked by the "Street of the dead" The pyramid of the sun is in the center, built on an artificial cave. The southern part is skewed about 16.5 degrees east of north, following the orientation of the Ciudadela, mostly surrounded by residential quarters, while the northern part is the ceremonial center used for among other things human sacrifice.]]
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Proskouriakoff Structure I at Xpuhil.jpg|thumb|Model of structure I of the Maya site of [[Xpuhil]].]] --&gt;
An important part of the [[Mesoamerican religion|Mesoamerican religious]] system was replicating their beliefs in concrete tangible forms, in effect making the world an embodiment of their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Miller and Karl Taube, introduction to "The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya" p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the Mesoamerican city was constructed to be a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], manifesting the same division that existed in the religious, mythical geography—a division between the underworld and the human world. The underworld was represented by the direction north and many structures and buildings related to the underworld, such as tombs, are often found in the city's northern half. The southern part represented life, sustenance and rebirth and often contained structures related to the continuity and daily function of the city state, such as monuments depicting the noble lineages, or residential quarters, markets etc. Between the two halves of the north/south axis was the plaza, often containing stelae resembling the [[world tree]] the Mesoamerican [[axis mundi]], and a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] which served as a crossing point between the two worlds. 

Some Mesoamericanists argue that in religious symbolism the Mesoamerican monumental architecture pyramids were mountains, stelae were trees, and wells, ballcourts and [[cenote|cenotes]] were caves that provided access to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Miller and Karl Taube write about this in their introduction to "The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya" pp. 31, they attribute this interpretation to Epigrapher David Stuart. American archeologist James E. Brady have done extensive research on importance of Caves in Mesoamerican culture. The title of the famous book "Forest of Kings" by Mayanist [[Linda Schele]] also alludes to the Maya belief that stelae represent trees, especially the world tree, axis mundi of the mayan cosmos.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orientation====
Mesoamerican architecture is often designed to align to specific celestial events. Some pyramids, temples, and other structures were designed to achieve special lighting effects on particular days important in the Mesoamerican cosmovision. A famous example is the "[[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]]" pyramid at [[Chichen Itza]], where a light-and-shadow effect can be observed during several weeks around the equinoxes. Contrary to a common opinion, however, there is no evidence that this phenomenon was the result of a purposeful design intended to commemorate the equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=El Sol en Chichén Itzá y Dzibilchaltún: la supuesta importancia de los equinoccios en Mesoamérica |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=25 |issue=149 |pages=26–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Much Mesoamerican architecture is also aligned to roughly 15° east of north.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni and Gibbs.  Other researchers give other estimates or averages, but there is a remarkable consistency across time and space to this general orientation.&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent H Malmstrom has argued&lt;ref&gt;In Chapter 22 of Archaeoastronomy in the Americas, edited by Ray A. Williamson, Ballena Press/Center for Archaeoastronomy, 1981, pp. 249–61, which can also be found at [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~izapa/M-15.pdf his website]. See also [http://www.jqjacobs.net/mesoamerica/meso_astro.html John Q Jacobs] article for more information on the alignments of Mesoamerican Cities&lt;/ref&gt; that this is because of a general wish to align the pyramids to face the sunset on August 13, which was the beginning date of the Maya [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count]] calendar. However, recent research has shown that the earliest orientations marking sunsets on August 13 (and April 30) occur outside of the Maya area. Their purpose must have been to record the dates separated by a period of 260 days (from August 13 to April 30), equivalent to the length of the sacred Mesoamerican calendrical count. In general, the orientations in Mesoamerican architecture tend to mark the dates separated by multiples of 13 and 20 days, i.e. of basic periods of the calendrical system. The distribution of these dates in the year suggests that the orientations allowed the use of observational calendars that facilitated the prediction of agriculturally significant dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=Anthony F. |title=Skywatchers: A Revised and Updated Version of Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |isbn=978-0-292-70504-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica |journal=Journal of Archaeological Research |date=2018 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=197–251 |doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; These conclusions are supported by the results of systematic research accomplished in various Mesoamerican regions, including central Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura prehispánica del centro de México |date=2001 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-970-18-4180-8 |url=https://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/sites/default/files/Sprajc_OrientacionesCentroMexico.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Maya Lowlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=A. |last2=Hartung |first2=H. |title=Maya City Planning and the Calendar |date=1986 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sánchez Nava |first1=Pedro Francisco |last2=Šprajc |first2=Ivan |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas |date=2015 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-607-484-727-7 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297155454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oaxaca, the Gulf Coast lowlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura de Mesoamérica: Oaxaca y el Golfo de México |date=2015 |publisher=Založba ZRC |location=Ljubljana |isbn=978-961-254-816-2 |url=http://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/sites/default/files/pkc08_sprajc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and western and northern Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |last3=Cañas Ortiz |first3=Alejandro |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura de Mesoamérica: Occidente y Norte |date=2016 |publisher=Založba ZRC |location=Ljubljana |isbn=978-961-254-892-6 |url=https://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/sites/default/files/sprajc_orientaciones-astronomicas-en-la-arquitectura.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; While solar orientations prevail, some prominent buildings were aligned to Venus extremes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=The Venus-Rain-Maize Complex in the Mesoamerican World View: Part I |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |date=1993 |volume=24 |pages=17–70 |url=https://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/sites/default/files/Sprajc_Venus-rain-maize_part1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notable example being the Governor's Palace at Uxmal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |editor1-last=Ruggles |editor1-first=Clive L.

===The Plaza===
At the heart of the Mesoamerican city were large plazas surrounded by the most important governmental and religious buildings, such as the royal [[acropolis]], great pyramid temples and occasionally [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballcourts]].

===The Main Pyramids===
Often the most important religious temples sat atop the towering pyramids, presumably as the closest place to the heavens.  While recent discoveries point toward the extensive use of pyramids as tombs, the temples themselves seem to rarely, if ever, contain burials.  Residing atop the pyramids, some of over two-hundred feet, such as that at [[El Mirador]], the temples were impressive and decorated structures themselves.  Commonly topped with a [[roof comb]], or superficial grandiose wall, these temples might have served as a type of propaganda.

===The Ball court===
[[File:MesoBallcourtTeotenango.JPG|thumb|left|Mesoamerican ball court at Teotenango]]
[[File:Pok ta pok ballgame maya indians mexico 3.JPG|thumb|Replica Mesoamerican ball court.]]
[[File:Mesoamerican Ballcourt terminology schema.svg|thumb|left|Layout chart of a typical Mesoamerican ball court.]]

{{main|Mesoamerican ball court}}
The [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] ritual was a symbolic journey between the underworld and the world of the living, and many ball courts are found in the mid-part of the city functioning as a connection between the northern and southern halves of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel Porter Weaver describes this on pp. 226–28 of the third edition of "The Aztecs, Maya and their Predecessors".&lt;/ref&gt;  All but the earliest ball courts are masonry structures.  Over 1300 ball courts have been identified, and although there is a tremendous variation in size, they all have the same general shape: a long narrow alley flanked by two walls with horizontal, sloping, and sometimes vertical faces. The later vertical faces, such as those at Chichen Itza and [[El Tajin]], are often covered with complex iconography and scenes of human sacrifice (see photo [[:Image:El Tajin Ballcourt Mural (Tom Aleto).jpg|here]]).

Although the alleys in early ball courts were open-ended, later ball courts had enclosed end-zones, giving the structure an [[Image:I, heavily serifed.png|7px]]-shape when viewed from above.  The playing alley may be at ground level, or the ball court may be "sunken".

Ball courts were no mean feats of engineering.  One of the [[sandstone]] stones on El Tajin's South Ball court is 11 m long and weighs more than 10 [[Tonne|tons]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkerson, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residential Quarters and Palaces===
[[File:Uxmal - Quadrangulo de las Monjas - Nördlicher Palast 2.jpg|thumb|left|Limestone carvings on the ruined Uxmal palace.]]
Large and often highly decorated, the palaces usually sat close to the center of a city and housed the population's elite.  Any exceedingly large royal palace, or one consisting of many chambers on different levels might be referred to as an acropolis.  However, often these were one-story and consisted of many small chambers and typically at least one interior courtyard; these structures appear to take into account the needed functionality required of a residence, as well as the decoration required for their inhabitants stature.  Archaeologists seem to agree that many palaces are home to various tombs.  At [[Copán]], beneath over four-hundred years of later remodeling, a tomb for one of the ancient rulers has been discovered and the [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]] at [[Tikal]] appears to have been the site of numerous burials during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Pre-classic]] and [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]] periods.

===Building materials===
[[File:Facade of the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (Teotihuacán).jpg|thumb|Teotihuacan style architecture displaying decorative ornamentation made of obsidian and shell inlaid into a painted [[Cantera (stone)|cantera]] surface set upon a [[tezontle]] interior.]]
The most  surprising aspect of the great Mesoamerican structures is their lack of many advanced technologies that would seem to be necessary for such constructions. Lacking metal tools, Mesoamerican architecture required one thing in abundance: manpower.  Yet, beyond this enormous requirement, the remaining materials seem to have been readily available. They most often utilized [[limestone]], which remained pliable enough to be worked with stone tools while being quarried, and only hardened once when removed from its bed.  In addition to the structural use of limestone, much of their mortar consisted of crushed, burnt, and mixed limestone that mimicked the properties of cement and was used just as widely for [[stucco]] finishing as it was for mortar. However, later improvements in quarrying techniques reduced the necessity for this limestone-stucco as their stones began to fit quite perfectly, yet it remained a crucial element in some [[post and lintel]] roofs. A common building material in central Mexico was [[tezontle]] (a light, volcanic rock). It was common for palaces and monumental structures to be made of this rough stone and then covered with stucco or with a [[Cantera (stone)|cantera]] [[Stone veneer|veneer]]. Very large and ornate architectural ornaments were fashioned from a very enduring stucco (kalk), especially in the Mayan region, where a type of hydraulic limestone cement or concrete was also used.&lt;ref&gt;James A O'Kon, The Lost Secrets of Maya Technology Pompton Plaines: Career Press 2012, pp. 114–23&lt;/ref&gt;In the case of the common houses, wooden framing, [[adobe]], and thatch were used to build homes over stone foundations. However, instances of what appear to be common houses of limestone have been discovered as well. Buildings were typically finished with high slanted roofs usually built of wood or thatch although stone roofs in these high slant fashions are also used rarely.

==Styles==

===Megalithic===
[[Image:Taludtablero.png|right|thumb|150px|The talud-tablero style used in many Mesoamerican pyramids and a prominent stylistic feature of Teotihuacano architecture]]
An architectural construction technique that employs large dry-laid limestone blocks (ca. 1 m x 50&amp;nbsp;cm x 30&amp;nbsp;cm) covered with a thick layer of [[stucco]].  This style was common in the northern Maya lowlands from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic]] until the early parts of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]].

===Talud-tablero===
{{Main|Talud-tablero}}
Pyramids in Mesoamerican were platformed pyramids and many used a style called ''talud-tablero'', which first became common in Teotihuacan. This style consists of a platform structure, or the "tablero," on top of a sloped "talud". Many different variants on the talud-tablero style arose throughout Mesoamerica, developing and manifesting itself differently among the various cultures.

===Classic Period Maya styles===

===Puuc===
{{Main|Puuc}}
So named after the Puuc hills in which this style developed and flourished during the latter portion of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] and throughout the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Classic]] in the northern Maya lowlands, [[Puuc|Puuc architecture]] consists of veneer facing stones applied to a concrete core.  Two [[façade]]s were typically built, partitioned by a ridge of stone.  The blank lower façade is formed by flat cut stones and punctuated by doorways.  The upper partition is richly decorated with repeating geometric patterns and iconographic elements, especially the distinctive curved-nosed [[Chaac]] masks.  Carved columnettes are also common.

[[Image:Corbelledarch.png|thumb|left|100px|the principle of the "false" or corbelled arch is to build it without a keystone, but just with overlapping tiers of blocks]][[Image:Arco maya.jpg|right|thumb|100px|A fine example of a [[Corbel arch|corbelled arch]] from the mayan site of [[Uxmal]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]]]

===Corbelled Arch===
Mesoamerican cultures never invented the [[keystone (architecture)|keystone]], and so were unable to build true [[arch]]es, but instead all of their architecture made use of the "false" or [[Corbel arch|Corbelled arch]]. These arches are built without centering and can be built without support, by corbelling regularly the horizontal courses of the wall masonry. This type of arch supports much less weight than a true arch. 

However, recent work by engineer James O'Kon suggests the Mesoamerican "arch" is technically not a corbelled arch at all but a trapezium truss system. Moreover, unlike a corbelled arch, it does not rely on overlapping layers of blocks but cast-in-place concrete often supported by timber thrust beams. Computer analysis reveals this to be structurally superior to a curved arch&lt;ref&gt;James A O'Kon, The Secrets of Maya Technology, Pompton PLains: New Page, 2012, pp. 149–50&lt;/ref&gt; {{dubious|James O'Kon and arch 'superiority'|date=June 2015}}

=== True Arch ===
Scholars such as David Eccott and Gordon Ekholm argue that true arches were known in pre-Columbian times in Mesoamerica; they point to various examples of true arches at a Maya site in La Muneca, the facade of Temple A at Nukum, two low domes at Tajin in Veracruz, a sweat bath at Chichen Itza, and an arch at Oztuma &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwerin|first=Karl|title=The Arch in Mesoamerica|url=https://www.academia.edu/16405208|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nC5ACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT273&amp;lpg=PT273&amp;dq=mesoamerica+true+arch#v=onepage&amp;q=mesoamerica%20true%20arch&amp;f=false|title=The Land of Prehistory: A Critical History of American Archaeology|last=Kehoe|first=Alice Beck|date=2015-12-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134720651|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.migration-diffusion.info/pdfdownload.php?id=72&amp;file=1|title=THE TRUE ARCH: AN ABSENT TRAIT IN PRECOLUMBIAN AMERICA?|last=Eccot|first=David J.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Michael the Syrian''' ({{lang-syc|ܡܝܟܐܝܠ ܣܘܪܝܝܐ}}; died 1199 AD), also known as '''Michael the Great''' ({{lang|syc|ܡܝܟܐܝܠ ܪܒܐ)}} or '''Michael Syrus''' or Michael the Elder, to distinguish him from his nephew,&lt;ref name="William Wright p.250"&gt;William Wright, ''A short history of Syriac literature'', p.250, n.3.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[List of Syriac Patriarchs of Antioch from 512 to 1783|patriarch]] of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] from 1166 to 1199. He is best known today as the author of the largest medieval ''Chronicle'', which he composed in [[Syriac language|Syriac]].  Various other materials written in his own hand have survived.

==Life==
The life of Michael is recorded by [[Bar Hebraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Syriac Literature'', p.250 f., referencing Bar Hebraeus, ''Chron. Eccl.'' vol. 1, p.575 f.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was born ca. 1126 in [[Melitene]] (today Malatya), the son of the Priest Eliya (Elias), of the Qindasi family.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''A short history of Syriac literature'', p.250, n.4, referencing [[Bar Hebraeus]], ''Chron. Eccles.'', vol. 1, 537.&lt;/ref&gt;  His uncle, the monk Athanasius, became bishop of [[Anazarbus]] in [[Cilicia]] in 1136.

At that period Melitene was part of the kingdom of the Turcoman [[Danishmends|Danishmend dynasty]], and, when that realm was divided in two in 1142, it became the capital of one principality.  In 1178 it became part of the [[Sultanate of Rûm]].  The Jacobite monastery of Mar Bar Sauma was close to the town, and had been the patriarchal seat since the 11th century.

As a child, Michael entered the service of the monastery, and became archimandrite before the age of thirty.  He made various improvements to the abbey fabric, including improving the water supply and the defences against raiders.  On 18 October 1166 he was elected Patriarch of the Jacobite church, and consecrated in the presence of twenty-eight bishops.

In 1168 he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and then stayed for a year at Antioch.  Both towns were at the time part of the Latin crusader states, and Michael established excellent relations with the crusader lords, especially with [[Patriarch Amalric of Jerusalem|Amaury de Nesle, Latin patriarch of Jerusalem]].  Returning to the monastery of Mar Bar Sauma in the summer of 1169, he held a synod and attempted to reform the church, then tainted with [[simony]].

The Byzantine emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manual I Comnenos]] made approaches to him to negotiate a reunion of the churches.  But Michael did not trust the Greeks.  He refused to go to Constantinople when invited by the emperor, and even refused twice, in 1170 and 1172, to meet his envoy Theorianus, instead sending as his own representative bishop John of Kaishoum and then his disciple Theodore bar Wahbon.  In three successive letters to the emperor, he replied with a simple statement of the [[miaphysite]] creed of the Jacobites.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Syriac Literature'', p.252, n.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1174 Michael had to contend with a revolt by a party of bishops.  He himself was twice arrested at the instigation of the dissident bishops, so he says; once by the servants of the prefect of Mardin and the second time by those of the emir of Mosul.  Also the monks of Bar Sauma rebelled against him in 1171 and 1176.

Between 1178 and 1180 he resided again in the crusader states, at Antioch and Jerusalem.  He was invited by Pope Alexander III to attend the [[Third Council of the Lateran]], but declined.  However he did participate by letter, writing a long treatise on the [[Albigensians]], based on the information he had been given.

In 1180 his former pupil Theodore Bar Wahbon had himself elected patriarch at Amida under the name of John by certain malcontent bishops, beginning a schism which lasted for thirteen years.  Michael took energetic action, got hold of the anti-patriarch and locked him up at Bar Sauma and formally deposed him.  Some of monks allowed Ibn Wahbon to escape, who fled to Damascus and tried in vain to appeal to [[Saladin]].  He then went to Jerusalem, and, after the fall of the city in 1187, went to [[Rumkale]] with the Armenian catholicos Gregory IV, who allowed him to obtain official recognition from Prince Leo II of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian Minor]].  Theodore had many supporters, and the schism did not end until the death of Theodore in the summer of 1193.  According to Bar Hebraeus Theodore could write and speak in Syriac, Greek, Armenian and Arabic, and composed a statement of his case against Michael in Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''A short history'' p.254.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1182, Michael received the sultan [[Kilij Arslan II]] at Melitene, and held cordial talks with him.

He died at the monastery of Bar Sauma on 7 November 1199 at the age of sixty-three, having been patriarch for thirty-three years.  His nephew, Michael the Younger, known as Yeshti' Sephethana [Syriac ܝܸܫܬ݂' ܣܸܦܗܸܬܗܲܢܲ] or "Big-lips",&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/shorthistoryofsy00wrig/shorthistoryofsy00wrig_djvu.txt Short History of Syriac Literature] at Digitized by the Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; became anti-patriarch at Melitene from 1199-1215, in opposition to Athanasius IX and then John XIV.&lt;ref name="William Wright p.250"/&gt;

==Works==
Michael was a profuse author.  He wrote works on the liturgy, on the doctrine of the Jacobite church, and on canon law.  Numerous sermons have also survived, mostly unpublished.  But he is best known for the World Chronicle that he composed, the longest and richest surviving chronicle in the Syriac language.

===The Chronicle===
[[File:Armenian translation of Michael the Syrian Chronicle.jpg|thumb|right|220px|13th century [[Armenian language|Armenian]] translation of Michael the Syrian Chronicle, manuscript of 1432]]
This Chronicle runs from Creation up to Michael's own times.  It uses earlier Ecclesiastical Histories now lost; for instance, its coverage of the Late Antique period relies mainly upon Dionysius of Tel Mahre.  It includes a version of the [[Josephus on Jesus|Testimonium Flavianum]].

The work is extant in a single manuscript written in 1598 in Syriac in a [[Serto]] hand.  This was copied from an earlier manuscript, itself copied from Michael's autograph.  The manuscript is today held in a locked box in a church in [[Aleppo]] and not accessible to scholarship. However the French scholar [[Jean-Baptiste Chabot]] arranged for a copy to be made by hand in 1888 and published a photographic reproduction in four volumes (1899–1910), with a French translation. In 2009, the facsimile of Edessan-Aleppo codex was published by [[Gorgias Press]] in the first volume (edited by Mor Gregorios Yuhanna Ibrahim) of a series on the Chronicle of Michael the Great.

An abbreviated Armenian translation also exists, from which Victor Langlois published a French translation in 1868.  This alone preserves the preface of the work.  A shorter Armenian version also exists which has not been published.

A [[Garshuni]] version is also extant in British Library ms. Orient. 4402, and an Arabic version beginning with book 5 exists in a Vatican manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;J.B.Chabot, ''Chronique...'' vol. 1, p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

As secondary witnesses: [[Bar Hebraeus]], pseudo-Jacob, and Maribas the Chaldean all rely upon Michael's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Hoyland

===Points of interest===
His work has been used by NASA scientists because of his record of climatic changes, now known to be linked to volcano eruptions.  He records that in 536 AD:
{{quote|The sun became dark and its darkness lasted for 18 months. Each day it shone for about 4 hours, and still this light was only a feeble shadow. Everyone declared that the sun would never recover its full light. The fruits did not ripen and the wine tasted like sour grapes.}}

And in 626 AD:
{{quote|In the year A.D. 626, the light of half the sphere of the sun disappeared, and there was darkness from October to June. As a result people said that the sphere of the sun would never be restored to its original state.}}

He is a contemporary source for the Latin [[crusader states]], and records the tolerance and liberalism of the Catholic Franks towards the [[miaphysites]]:&lt;ref name=templizer&gt;http://www.templiers.net/saladin/pdf/fpdf_2.php&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The pontiffs of our Jacobite church lived in the middle of them without being persecuted or molested.  In Palestine, as in Syria, they never raised any difficulty on account of their faith, nor insisted on a single formula for all the peoples and all the languages of the Christians.  But they considered as Christian everyone who venerated the cross without enquiry or cross-examination.}}

He also praises the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and [[Hospitallers]] to his own people:&lt;ref name=templizer/&gt;
{{quote|When the Templars or Hospitallers have to occupy a military post, and hold it to the death, they die doing so.  When a brother dies, they feed the poor on his behalf for forty days, and give lodgings to forty people.  They consider those who die in combat as martyrs.  They distribute to the poor a tenth part of their food and drink.  Every time they bake bread in one of their houses, they reserve a tenth part for the poor.  In spite of their great riches, they are charitable to all who venerate the cross.  They founded everywhere hospitals, serving and helping strangers who had fallen sick.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9864">The [[Austromarxism|Austromarxist]] principle of '''national personal autonomy''' ("personal principle"), developed by [[Otto Bauer]] in his 1907 book ''Die Nationalitätenfrage und die Sozialdemokratie'' (The Nationalities Question and Social Democracy) was seen by him a way of gathering the geographically divided members of the same nation to "organize nations not in territorial bodies but in simple association of persons", thus radically disjoining the nation from the [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] and making of the nation a non-territorial [[Voluntary association|association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer|first=Otto|others=Joseph O'Donnell (Translator)|title=The question of nationalities and social democracy|editor=Ephraim J.

==Medem==
In his 1904 text, Medem exposed his version of the concept:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Let us consider the case of a country composed of several national groups, e.g. Poles, Lithuanians and Jews. Each national group would create a separate movement. All citizens belonging to a given national group would join a special organisation that would hold cultural assemblies in each region and a general cultural assembly for the whole country. The assemblies would be given financial powers of their own: either each national group would be entitled to raise taxes on its members, or the state would allocate a proportion of its overall budget to each of them. Every citizen of the state would belong to one of the national groups, but the question of which national movement to join would be a matter of personal choice and no authority would have any control over his decision. The national movements would be subject to the general legislation of the state, but in their own areas of responsibility they would be autonomous and none of them would have the right to interfere in the affairs of the others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plassereaud|first=Yves|date=May 2000|title=Choose Your Own Nationality  or The Forgotten History of Cultural Autonomy|journal=[[Le Monde diplomatique]]|language=English|url=http://www.panarchy.org/plasseraud/choice.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Supporters==
This principle was later adopted by various parties, among them the [[Jewish Socialist Workers Party]] from its foundation in 1906, the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Labour Bund]] at its August 1912 Conference (when the motion "On National Cultural Autonomy" became part of the Bund's program), the [[Dashnak|Armenian social democrats]], the Russian [[Constitutional Democratic Party]] (''Kadets'') at its June 1917's Ninth Congress,&lt;ref name=bowring&gt;Bill Bowring, "Burial and resurrection, Karl Renner's controversial influence on the "national question" in Russia", in{{cite book|title=National cultural autonomy and its contemporary critics|editor=Ephraim Nimni|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|pages=260|isbn=978-0-415-24964-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zP_9TccTwnYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first Ottoman then Greek [[Socialist Workers' Federation]] of [[Thessaloniki]], the left-wing [[Zionist]]s ([[Hashomer Hatzair]]) in favour of a [[one-state solution|binational solution]] in [[History of Palestine|Palestine]], the Jewish [[Folkspartei]] (inspired by [[Simon Dubnov]], who had developed a concept of Jewish autonomy close to Bauer's), and the [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania]] (DAHR) after 1989.

==Opponents==
The whole concept was strongly opposed by the [[Bolshevik]]s. [[Stalin]]'s pamphlet ''[[Marxism and the National Question]]'' (1913) was their ideological reference on the matter, along with [[Lenin]]'s ''Critical Remarks on the National Question'' (December 1913), in particular in the chapter "Cultural-National Autonomy".&lt;ref name=bowring/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stalin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stalin|first=Joseph|title=Marxism and the National Question|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]|date=Prosveshcheniye, Nos. 3-5, March–May 1913|url=http://www.marx.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03.htm|accessdate=2009-11-12|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lenin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenin|first=Vladimir|title=Critical Remarks on the National Question|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]|date=Prosveshcheniye Nos. 10, 11 and 12, October–December 1913|url=http://www.marx.org/archive/lenin/works//1913/crnq/index.htm|accessdate=2009-11-12|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Stalin was later People's Commissar of Nationalities from 1917 - 1923.) Lenin's and Stalin's critics of the national personal autonomy concept were later joined by the Catalan [[Andreu Nin]] in his article ''The Austrian School, National Emancipation Movements'' (1935).&lt;ref name="nin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/nin/1935/xx/austromarx.htm|title=Austro-Marxism and the National Question (chapter in National Emancipation Movements)|last=Nin|first=Andrés|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]|year=1935|language=English|accessdate=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
It was adopted as an official policy in the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (1917–1920) and in the interwar [[History of Estonia (1920-1939)|Estonian Republic]] (1925  Law on Personal Autonomy), and it was included in the Declaration Concerning the Protection of Minorities in Lithuania by the [[League of Nations]] in 1925.&lt;ref name="bowring"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.einst.ee/factsheets/cult_auton/|title=Law on Cultural Autonomy for National Minorities|year=1925|publisher=The [[Estonian Institute]]|accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forost.ungarisches-institut.de/pdf/19220512-1.pdf|title=Declaration concerning the protection of minorities in Lithuania|year=1922|publisher=[[League of Nations]]|accessdate=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autonomous representative structure of the [[Yishuv|Palestinian Jews]] between 1920 and 1949, the [[Assembly of Representatives (Mandate Palestine)|Asefat ha-Nivharim]], can also be considered as an implementation of the national personal autonomy principle.

Since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and its satellites regimes, the national personal autonomy is the principle on which legislation applying to ethnic minorities has been enacted {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} such as [[Estonia]]'s (1993 National Minorities Cultural Autonomy Act),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/XX00038.htm|title=National Minorities Cultural Autonomy Act|year=1993|publisher=The [[Estonian Ministry of Justice]]|accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hungary]]'s Act LXXVII of 1993 on the Rights of National and Ethnic Minorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b4e90.html |title=Act LXXVII of 1993 on the Rights of National and Ethnic Minorities|year=1993|publisher=[[Minority Electronic Resources]]|accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvia]]'s 1991 Law on Unrestricted Development and Right to Cultural Autonomy of Latvia's Nationalities and Ethnic Groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b4e90.html|title=Law on Unrestricted Development and Right to Cultural Autonomy of Latvia's Nationalities and Ethnic Groups (last amended 1994)|year=1991|publisher=[[UNHCR]]|accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lithuania]]'s 1989 Law on Ethnic Minorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minelres.lv/NationalLegislation/Lithuania/Lithuania_Minorities_English.htm

 [[File:Nićifor Dučić, Nova iskra (1899).jpg|thumb|Nićifor Dučić (1899).]]
[[Archimandrite]] '''Nićifor Dučić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Нићифор Дучић}}; 1832–1900), was a [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinian]] [[Serbs|Serb]] [[theologian]], [[historian]], [[philologist]] and writer, educated in [[Belgrade]] and [[Paris]]. He was an Orthodox [[monk]] who refused the title of a [[bishop]], devoted lover of enlightenment and staunch patriot.

In 1848 in [[Zitomislic|Žitomislić]] Monastery was founded the first school for education of [[Serbia]]n children and school for education of Orthodox [[priest]]s, which were established by [[monk]]s of Žitomislić – Nićifor Dučić and Sirafin Perović. [[Archimandrite]] of [[Herzegovina]] Nićifor Dučić founded the Orthodox [[Seminary|Seminarium]] in [[Cetinje]] in 1863. In 1880 Dučić was appointed as Museum Keeper of Serbian National Museum in Belgrade, and since 1883 as a Director of [[National Library of Serbia]].

Dučić's monographs about monasteries ([[Tvrdos|Tvrdoš]], [[Zitomislic|Žitomislić]], [[Moraca Monastery|Morača]], [[Ostrog Monastery|Ostrog]]) have not lost the cultural-historical value since science must further take some studies into consideration: ''[[Christmas]] in [[Montenegro]]'' (1867); ''[[Boka Kotorska|Boka]] and [[Zeta plain|Zeta]]'' (1875); ''Slav Manuscripts in the National Library in Paris'' (1889).

Between 1891-99 Dučić himself published his collected works and managed to the ninth book. The study ''The Old Times of Hilandar and the Monograph of [[Hilandar]]'' was published in 1884 and then it was included into the fourth book of collected works in 1895.

==Biography==
Nićifor Dučić was born in the village of Lug, near [[Trebinje]] in southeastern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], in 1832. He received an excellent education in [[Serbia]],  [[Serbian Vojvodina]], and later in [[Paris]]. During the [[1848 Revolution]] he joined the Austrians as a young volunteer, and after he returned to his native Herzegovina  where at the Duži Monastery he took holy orders under the guidance of his uncle, the abbot (archimandrite). In 1858 he founded with Serafim Perović a school in Duži, and taught religion and history in Mostar. From late 1858 until 1860he oversaw the [[Žitomislić Monastery]], situated near the River [[Neretva]]. There he wrote several series of monographs, literary histories, archaeological questions, including the history of Metox Monastery Duži and Tvrdoš, Žitomislić Monastery, [[Hilandar Monastery]], and about the Serbian community and the Serbian Orthodox Church of Saint Spiridon in downtown [[Trieste]]. Dučić himself served in his youth in the Herzegovinian Uprising of 1852-1862, led by Luka Vukalović. Dučić's strength, daring and activity fitted him to shine in operations largely composed of night marches, surprises, escalades, and hand-to-hand combat. The main scene of his achievement was in Bosnia and Herzegovina and when those hostilities died down, and there was no amnesty forthcoming from the [[Ottoman Porte]] and [[Constantinople]] as promised, Dučić left for Montenegro. He had a relation in Cetinje where he settled in 1864. There he was elevated to the rank of archimandrite, and he also helped Serafim Perović, his old friend from Duži, start a school of higher learning. When Perović opened the first seminary at [[Cetinje]], Dučić was named rector. He wrote and published the rules of the school. Conditions for the pupils were favourable, with particular considerations for the poorest among them. He also entered into Montenegrin service, and was immediately nominated to head a diplomatic mission as an intermediary between Cetinje and Belgrade.

Returning with Serb General Milojko Lešjanin, Nićifor Dučić, now [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]]'s envoy, exchanged copies of a treaty with [[Mihailo Obrenović III, Prince of Serbia]] and Prime Minister [[Ilija Garašanin]] signed October 14, 1867. Its stated purpose was to ''"prepare an insurrection in Turkey and unite the entire Serbian people in a single state."'' His pamphlets and revolutionary doctrines (that came to Austrian and Turkish attention) compelled him to leave Montenegro for Italy.
Travelling about the Serbian communities in diaspora, Dučić had an opportunity to become personally acquainted with the strong patriotic feelings of these scattered Serbs, which would eventually give his observations all the more weight. In the meantime, Garašanin was preparing a general rising of all Serb lands against Turkish rule, and in 1868 Dučić was  back in Belgrade. But the execution of Garašanin's plans was frustrated by the assassination of Prince Mihailo (Obrenović) on the 10th of June 1868 (or the 28th of May 1868 O.S.). Dučić was long a warm advocate of the political union of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbian Vojvodina, Kosovo Metohija, and Serbia.
 [[File:Nićifor Dučić, 1874.jpg|thumb|left|1874 portrait by [[Stevan Todorović]].]]
With the accession of Prince [[Milan I of Serbia]] and the new prime minister, [[Jovan Ristić]], who knew Dučić's value, employed him and trusted him; and he took part in secret missions for them, negotiating with the Turks. During September 1873, as Ristić's envoy, Dučić held consultations with two Croatian politicians Matija Mrazović and [[Franjo Rački]] about the unification of all Serbian people with Serbia.
 [[File:Volunteer squad of the Serbo-Turkish War, led by Nićifor Dučić.jpg|thumb|250px|Nićifor Dučić with Montenegrin nobles, 1876.]]
Nicifor Dučić and count Petar Vukotić had become enthusiastic partisans of friendship and alliance with Serbia and even favoured their complete unification. They and Prince Nicholas now believed  Montenegro's policy must be subject to Serbia's and that Serbdom's salvation lay in complete unification with the rest of Serb lands. Furthermore, [[Filip Hristić]] arrived in Cetinje from Belgrade to assure Prince Nicholas that Serbia will  back Montenegro in case of war with Turkey. Soon the war was declared in 1876 by Serbia in alliance with Montenegro in order to profit by the new insurrection in the Herzegovina which had begun in the summer of 1875 at [[Nevesinje]]. Dučić's love of adventure led him, during the First Serbo-Turkish War (1876–1878), to take the command of a brigade and enter into the fray. In this capacity he performed splendid service at [[Aleksinac]], where he was wounded, by delaying Turkish advance on Belgrade before a conclusion of peace could be drawn up. The final result of the war which intensified the Balkan crisis culminated in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)]]. By the settlement of the conflict Serbia and Montenegro acquired their respective and total independence from the Ottoman Empire. But Bosnia-Herzegovina was not as fortunate. It was sold to the Habsburgs  by the Turks, leaving a powder keg open for ignition. His achievements, however, as archimandrite, member of parliament, historiographer, academic, soldier, negotiator, polemic and translator, showed him to be also a daring, resourceful and skilful commander, worthy to be ranked among the illustrious names of Serbian heroes. With his quill and his cross and his sword he pleaded for the welfare and development of the Serbian nation, leaving us his voluminous monographs, articles, pamphlets and books. He died at Belgrade in 1900.

==His works==
Though one of the most remarkable of Serbian writers, historians and diplomatists, Nićifor Dučić laboured for many years in comparative obscurity. Dučić began to write early, and had, according to his own account, composed several articles when he was sixteen. As a contributor to newspapers and magazines, he came under the notice of [[Ilarion Ruvarac]], who encouraged him to continue to produce well-researched historical monographs for learned societies and their periodicals and journals. He wrote a treatise about Serbs living in the port city of Trieste, entitled ''"The Serbian Parish in Trieste"''.

[[Njegoš]]'s poetic works remained practically unrecognized and unnoticed by our littérateurs for more than two decades, until Nićifor Dučić wrote: ''Primjetbe na "Komentar Gorskog vijenca"'' (Belgrade, Državna Štamparija, 1870).

Dučić once complained: ''The Greek metropolitans ordain as clergy even such people as can hardly read the church books.'' (''Istorija srpske pravoslavne crkve od prvijeh desetina VII viejeka to nasih dana,'' Beograd, 1892).

In 1869 Dučić became a member of the a Serbian Learned Society, and for a time held the post of director (librarian) of the Serbian National Library, from 1880 to 1886.

His research has also focused on 17th-century history of philosophy and science, on [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[René Descartes]] in particular, and on values and science.

== Mechanisms and explanation ==
Machamer's work has been influential in developing an account of [[scientific explanation]] understood as the search for and filling in of mechanisms. His co-authored 2000 article (with [[Lindley Darden]] and Carl Craver) “Thinking about Mechanisms”, published in ''[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]]'', has been cited over 1,000 times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=thinking+about+mechanisms&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C39&amp;as_sdtp= Google Scholar Citation Data]&lt;/ref&gt; His current work explores further consequences of this view in "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02698590412331289242#.U20fTPldWSo Activities and Causation: The Metaphysics and Epistemology of Mechanisms]," ''International Studies in the Philosophy of Science'' 187.1 (2004): 27–39, and in work in progress "Explaining Mechanisms"&lt;ref&gt;Machamer, Peter.

The '''Royal Ballet School''' is one of the world's greatest centres of [[classical ballet]] training.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ellies-Chance-Ballet-School-Diaries/dp/0439963702 Book review from [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], citing the Royal Ballet School as being world famous&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6336595.stm|author=Taggart, Maggie|title=Ballet star dances his way back home|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 February 2007|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Thomas, Liz|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/13735/royal-ballet-to-welcome-in-bbc-cameras|title=Royal Ballet to welcome in BBC cameras|work=The Stage|date=15 August 2006|accessdate=4 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612042818/http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/13735/royal-ballet-to-welcome-in-bbc-cameras|archivedate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by the Anglo-Irish ballerina and choreographer [[Ninette de Valois]], the school's aim is to train and educate outstanding classical ballet dancers for [[the Royal Ballet]] (based at the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[London]]) and [[Birmingham Royal Ballet]].

Admission to the School is based purely on talent and potential, regardless of academic ability or personal circumstances, and 90% of current students rely on financial support to attend the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.royalballetschool.org.uk/information/fees/|title=Fees|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is based over two sites, [[White Lodge, Richmond Park]] (for students aged 11–16) and [[Covent Garden]] (for students from 16–19 years old) based in purpose-built studios on [[Floral Street]], adjacent to the [[Royal Opera House]].

The Royal Ballet School has, since 1926, produced dancers and choreographers of international renown, including [[Margot Fonteyn|Dame Margot Fonteyn]], [[Beryl Grey|Dame Beryl Grey]], [[Kenneth MacMillan|Sir Kenneth MacMillan]], [[Darcey Bussell|Dame Darcey Bussell]], [[Alessandra Ferri]] and [[Viviana Durante]], as well as current Director of [[The Royal Ballet]] [[Kevin O'Hare]]. Graduates of the school have also achieved employment in [[musical theatre]], [[contemporary dance|contemporary]] and [[jazz dance]], television and film.

==History==
In 1926, the [[Ireland|Irish]]-born dancer [[Ninette de Valois]] founded the ''Academy of Choreographic Art'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalballetschool.org.uk/discover/history/|title=The Royal Ballet School - History|accessdate=28 January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206191440/http://www.royal-ballet-school.org.uk/Information/history.htm |archivedate=6 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a dance school for girls and the predecessor of today's Royal Ballet School. Her intention was to form a repertory ballet company and school, leading her to collaborate with the Inglisch [[theatrical producer]] and theatre owner [[Lilian Baylis]].

Baylis owned [[the Old Vic]] theatre and acquired [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]] theatre in 1925. In 1928, she engaged de Valois to stage dance performances at both theatres and she re-opened Sadler's Wells theatre in 1931, with de Valois' school moving into studios on the site as the Sadler's Wells Ballet School, teaching both boys and girls. At the same time, the Vic-Wells Ballet Company was formed using students of the school and other notable dancers of the era. Both the school and the ballet company developed quickly and after ballet performances ceased at the Old Vic, the ballet company was renamed the Sadler's Wells Ballet.

In 1946, the company moved to become the resident ballet company at the newly re-opened [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]] and as a result, in 1947 the school moved from Sadler's Wells to premises in Barons Court, with academic education being introduced for younger students.

Following rapid expansion, in 1955 the school secured the premises at White Lodge in Richmond Park, London. This was established at the time as the Royal Ballet 'Lower School', a residential [[boarding school]] for children aged 11–16, combining general education and vocational ballet training. The Royal Ballet School 'Upper School' was established at the school's existing premises in Barons Court with students studying ballet on a full-time basis between the ages of 16–19.

In October 1956, a Royal Charter was granted officially linking the ballet company and school and they became The Royal Ballet School and Royal Ballet Company. A second smaller company still performed at Sadler's Wells and toured around the UK and this became the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet. de Valois retired as Director in 1970.

In 1990, the Sadler's Wells company moved to become the resident ballet company at the [[Birmingham Hippodrome]], in [[Birmingham]], where it was renamed [[Birmingham Royal Ballet]], forming a new association with the [[Elmhurst Ballet School|Elmhurst School for Dance]] in 2002.

In January 2003, The Royal Ballet School's older students (aged 16–19) moved to a newly constructed studio complex in Floral Street, adjacent to the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, where The Royal Ballet remains the resident ballet company. A bridge was constructed between the school and the Opera House, linking the school with the theatre and The Royal Ballet Company's own studios. The designer of the bridge received an architectural award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-worldfamous-architect-the-cancer-victim-and-the-dream-that-turned-into-a-glittering-prize-731786.html|title=The world-famous architect, the cancer victim and the dream that turned into a glittering prize|work=[[The Independent]]|date=10 June 2004|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is known as the ''Bridge of Aspiration''.

==White Lodge==
The Royal Ballet School's younger students moved to [[White Lodge, Richmond Park]] in [[Richmond, London]] in 1955 when the school was split for the first time. The [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] building is a former royal residence and hunting lodge built during the reign of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. It is the School's permanent premises and there has been extensive redevelopment of the site to provide dance and academic facilities and accommodation for students.

Children attend the school between the ages of 11-16 and entry to the school is by audition only. The school receives over twenty thousand applications every year and holds auditions in major UK cities. Having an international reputation, the school also receives applications from other countries. As a [[boarding school]], the majority of students live on site, although there are a small number of day-students.

In dance, students study classical ballet, character dance, contemporary, gymnastics, Irish, Morris and Scottish dancing.  Later in their training, students study ballet repertoire, solos and pas de deux and boys undertake upper body conditioning. The school offers academic study at the level of a typical secondary school, both at Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4, with all students sitting [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] examinations.

==Covent Garden==
[[File:Skybridge1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Bridge of Aspiration'' linking the Royal Ballet Upper School on the left with the [[Royal Opera House]], designed by [[Flint &amp; Neill]] and [[Buro Happold]] with [[WilkinsonEyre]]]]
The Royal Ballet School's Covent Garden base was established in 1955, when the younger students were moved to White Lodge. The school remained at existing studios in Barons Court, London, with academic studies introduced for the first time. Later in 2003, the school relocated to new premises, and the former Baron's Court site now houses the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]].

The school relocated to new, purpose-built premises in [[Covent Garden]] in January 2003.  The complex is a four-storey building with six dance studios, including a studio theatre with retractable raked seating for an audience of 200. The building also houses changing rooms and showers for male and female students, a gym and fitness room, a pilates studio, physiotherapy suite and students common room. Facilities for academic education include four classrooms, a library with computer equipment, an art studio and audiovisual suite. All the dance studios are linked to the audiovisual suite so that classes and rehearsals can be filmed as a training tool, enabling the dancers to analyse themselves.

Alongside a timetable of intensive ballet training, students also study pas de deux, solos, repertoire, character, contemporary dance, stagecraft, make-up, and body conditioning. 3rd year students get many opportunities throughout the year to train with The Royal Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet.

==Performances==
Each year The Royal Ballet School presents its Summer Performances, featuring students from all age groups in a wide variety of classical and contemporary works. The highlight of the school's dance year is the annual matinée at the Royal Opera House, which showcases graduate students before they embark on their professional careers as well as featuring students from all years of the school. The programme includes new works and heritage pieces from the Royal Ballet repertory and culminates in a grand défilé, in which every student of the school appears on stage in a choreographed curtain call.

==Prima Ballerina Assoluta==
The Royal Ballet School is unique in having trained four of only a small number of dancers in history to have been recognised as [[Prima Ballerina Assoluta]], the ultimate honorary title for a ballerina. Exclusively trained at The Royal Ballet School and dancing her entire professional career with The Royal Ballet, [[Margot Fonteyn]] was appointed Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the company by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1979. Having trained at The Royal Ballet School from 1959 to 1966, [[Eva Evdokimova]] would go on to become an international guest ballerina, being recognised as a Prima Ballerina Assoluta following her performances with the Kirov Ballet in the late 1970s. The title was later recognised officially by the German Senate. [[Phyllis Spira]] began training at the Royal Ballet School in 1959, joining the Royal Ballet touring company in 1960. Choosing to shun an international ballet career, she returned to her native South Africa, where she danced the majority of her career with CAPAB ballet, today's [[Cape Town City Ballet]]. She was appointed Prima Ballerina Assoluta by the [[State President of South Africa]] in 1984. Most recently, Royal Ballet School graduate [[Alessandra Ferri]] was appointed Prima Ballerina Assoluta of [[La Scala Theatre Ballet]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teatroallascala.org/en/teatropiermarini/complessi_artistici/corpo_di_ballo/corpo_di_ballo_page_3.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=10 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710073521/http://www.teatroallascala.org/en/teatropiermarini/complessi_artistici/corpo_di_ballo/corpo_di_ballo_page_3.html|archivedate=10 July 2010|df=dmy-all}} Citing Alessandra Ferri as Prima Ballerina Assoluta of La Scala&lt;/ref&gt; Another British ballerina, [[Alicia Markova]], was also tutored by Royal Ballet School founder Ninette de Valois, and would go on to be a leading ballerina with the [[Ballets Russes]], the first Prima Ballerina of The [[Royal Ballet]], a founder ballerina with [[American Ballet Theatre]], and co-founder of [[English National Ballet]] who now recognise her as the company's Prima Ballerina Assoluta. Although not trained at The Royal Ballet School, this direct connection with school founder Ninette de Valois brings the total up to five.

==Plot ==
In the present day, 78-year-old Elle-Marja (who calls herself Christina, these days) returns with her son, Olle, and granddaughter Sanna, to Lapland, and her childhood society, to attend her younger sister's funeral. Elle-Marja doesn't want to be there. She does not like the Sami people, calls them thieves and liars, and even though her first language is [[Southern Sami language|Southern Sami]], refuses to speak it and pretends to not understand it. She even refuses to spend the night at her late sister's family home and would rather check into a hotel. (This part of ''Sami Blood'' is taken directly from ''[[Stoerre Vaerie]].'')

In the 1930s, 14-year-old Elle-Marja is sent  with her younger sister Njenna to the nomad school. It is a [[boarding school]] for Sami children where a blonde teacher from [[Småland]] teaches them [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and to know their place. Speaking [[Sami languages|Sami]], even just among themselves outside of the classroom, results in beatings. Her feeling of alienation is only intensified when scientists from ''[[Statens institut för rasbiologi|the State Institute for Racial Biology]]'' in [[Uppsala]] came to the school to measure and photograph the class naked in the presence of each other, teachers and neighbourhood boys.

After threatening a group of boys with her father's old knife because they called her racist names and slurs, they nick the edge of her ear like the Sami people do with reindeer.  She changes out of her [[gaeptie]]&lt;ref name="gt"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://baakoeh.oahpa.no/detail/nob/sma/kofte.html |title= kofte |website= Nedtedigibaakoeh (Norwegian-Southern Sámi dictionary) |publisher= [[University of Tromsø|The Centre for Saami Language Technology]] |access-date= 31 October 2017 | language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ss"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://saemiensijte.no/om-sorsamer/|title= Om sørsamer |publisher= The National Museum of Southern Sámi History and Culture |access-date= 31 October 2017 | language=no |trans-title= About the Southern Sámi }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also called gapta,&lt;ref name="gt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ss"/&gt; gåptoe&lt;ref name="gt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ss"/&gt; depending on the Southern Sámi dialect) and takes one of her teacher's dresses from a clothes line.

A group of young soldiers pass her on their way to a dance and asks her to come along—it is the first time anyone who is not Sami has treated her like a human being. Elle-Marja sneaks off to the dance, and for a couple of hours she gets to experience how it feels to have the respect others and be treated with decency by them without question. That is when she decides that she will leave Lapland, go to Uppsala, and study at the [[Uppsala University|university]].

School staff remove her from the dance and she is given a spanking with a switch. The school refuse her request to advance her studies in Uppsala, because the curriculum for the Sami is different from that in other Swedish schools and they feel that the Sami could not cope with urban society. She runs away to town, steals some clothes and burns her gaeptie, and invites herself to stay with Niklas, whom she met at the dance. His parents ask her to leave and he will not lend her the money she needs for her school fees, forcing her to go home. Eventually, her mother gives her the money to continue her schooling.

At the end of the film, she apologises to her dead sister for leaving her culture and people.

'''United We Stand: What More Can I Give''' was a [[benefit concert]] led by [[Michael Jackson]]&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2001/10/22/jackson_benefit/|work=Salon|title=The worst benefit concert ever!|date=October 22, 2001 |accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; held on October 21, 2001 at [[RFK Stadium]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=mtv&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe D'Angelo |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1450229/20011022/story.jhtml |title='NSYNC, Michael Jackson, P. Diddy, Mariah Stand United At D.C. Concert - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=October 22, 2001 |accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concert was the third major concert held in tribute to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]]. The other two were held in [[New York City]].

== Background ==
After he completed his [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration|30th-anniversary special concert tour]] with [[The Jacksons|his brothers]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], Jackson was originally supposed to attend a meeting at the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] on September 11, 2001, but overslept and did not attend. He organized the benefit concert as a response.

==Performances==
The concert was a half-day-long spectacle beginning in the early afternoon and lasting well into the night. Performers ranged from music icons including [[Mariah Carey]], [[James Brown]], [[Al Green]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Carole King]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Bette Midler]], [[America (band)|America]], and [[Huey Lewis]] to starting stars of that time including [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]], the [[Goo Goo Dolls]], [[Train (band)|Train]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Usher (singer)|Usher]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], and [[NSYNC]].&lt;ref name=mtv /&gt; Each performer did a brief set usually amounting to about five songs apiece.

In order, the performances were: [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Krystal Harris]], [[Huey Lewis and the News]], [[James Brown]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Billy Gilman]], [[O-Town]], [[Usher (singer)|Usher]], [[Christina Milian]], [[Carole King]], [[Al Green]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Bette Midler]], [[CeCe Peniston]], [[Aerosmith]], [[America (band)|America]], [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]] (with [[Faith Evans]] singing backup in the choir), [[NSYNC]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Goo Goo Dolls]], [[Train (band)|Train]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Mary J. Blige]] and [[Michael Jackson]], who performed "[[Man in the Mirror]]". Then everyone joined together, including [[Toni Braxton]], [[MC Hammer]] and [[Mýa]], for closing the show by performing "[[What More Can I Give]]".

Notable appearances were given by [[Aerosmith]], who performed at the festival as well as a scheduled concert in [[Indianapolis]] on the same night, while both [[Destiny's Child]] and the [[Goo Goo Dolls]] had performed the previous night at [[The Concert for New York City]].&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rockontour.net/rfk21.htmll|title=A Capitol Concert Honoring the Pentagon Heroes|date=October 21, 2001 |accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==
The event was plagued with problems, such as guests that did not show up (including [[Mick Jagger]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Ricky Martin]], [[Aaron Carter]] and [[MC Hammer]]), faulty sound equipment, and concessionaires running out of food and beverages.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;

== Television broadcast ==
The event was televised, in an edited format, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] several days after the concert. During the telecast, there was no mention of Jackson's name and he was always filmed with the rest of the singers in the background; this was because Jackson signed a contract with [[CBS]] (the former owner of [[Epic Records|his record label]]) over the 30th Anniversary Special to not appear under his name in any other program; the airing of "Man in the Mirror" at an awards ceremony was also canceled.

== Host and special appearances ==
[[John Stamos]] hosted the event, and appearances were also made by celebrities including [[Kevin Spacey]] along with political figures such as the mayor of [[Washington, D.C.]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4761">{{Genocide of Indigenous peoples}}

'''Utilitarian genocide''' is one of five forms of [[genocide]] categorized and defined in 1975 by genocide scholar [[Vahakn Dadrian]].{{efn|"The pioneer genocide scholar Vahakn Dadrian introduced the concept of "utilitarian genocide" in a landmark 1975 article, "A Typology of Genocide." He identified five "ideal types" of genocide, based mainly on the primary objective of the perpetrator:
*cultural genocide, aiming at assimilation;
*latent genocide, a by-product of war;
*retributive genocide, localized punishment;
*utilitarian genocide, to obtain wealth;
*optimal genocide, aiming at total obliteration".{{sfn|Markusen}}}}
[[Utilitarian]] genocide is distinctly different from [[ideological]]ly-motivated genocides like [[the Holocaust]] and the [[Cambodian genocide]]. This form of genocide has as its aim some form of material gain, such as the seizure of territory in order to gain control of economic resources for commercial exploitation.{{sfn|Kakar|1997|p=214}}{{sfn|Mertens|2005}} Two given examples of this form are the [[genocide of indigenous peoples in Brazil]] and the [[genocide of indigenous peoples in Paraguay]].{{sfn|Hitchcock|2008|p=547}}

This form of genocide was highly prominent during the [[European colonialism|European colonial expansions]] into the Americas, Oceania, and Africa. The colonial expansion into the Americas was markedly different in its approaches to the accumulation of wealth. The [[French colonization of the Americas]] through exploitation and the [[fur trade]] had a minor impact on the indigenous peoples. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] however was devastating to the indigenous population, as was the [[British colonization of the Americas]].{{sfn|Grenke|2005|pp=223&amp;ndash;224}} Dadrian has also given as further examples of utilitarian genocide the murders of [[Moors]] and Jews during the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and the killing of [[Cherokee Indians]] during the colonial expansion of the United States.{{sfn|Smeulers|2011|p=170}}

This type of genocide has continued into the twentieth century, with the ongoing genocide of indigenous tribes in the rain forests of South America primarily due to progress and the development of resources within their territories; these regions are exploited for economic gain the indigenous peoples are considered a "hindrance" and are forcibly relocated or killed.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=25}}{{sfn|Alvarez|2001|p=50}}

'''W. C. Firebaugh''' was the author of two works on the history of [[inns]] and [[taverns]], and also of a fine English translation of [[Petronius]]'s ''[[Satyricon]]'', the fragmentary realistic novel of low life under the [[Roman Empire]].

The translation was published in 1922 in New York, in a very expensive ($30) limited edition, by [[Horace Liveright]], founder of the [[Modern Library]]. Like earlier English translations, but more completely, Firebaugh's ''Satyricon'' includes the spurious [[Supplements to the Satyricon|supplements]] devised by various early scholars and forgers in an attempt to round out the fragmentary story. Firebaugh was however careful to distinguish all these supplements from the real translated text. His is still the only English translation of the supplement by [[José Marchena]], which, because of its obscenity, had previously been printed only in the original Latin.

The 1923 publication includes a sequence of 100 etchings by the Australian artist [[Norman Lindsay]], originally used in the even rarer 1910 ''Satyricon'' edited by [[Stephen Gaselee (diplomat)|Stephen Gaselee]].

The original text, the etchings, and the Marchena supplement were all arguably pornographic by the strict standards of English-language publishing in the 1920s. [[John S. Sumner]], secretary of the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]], obtained a copy before publication and accused Liveright of selling obscene material directed to the public. After a celebrated trial the case was dismissed by the New York court.

Four years after the initial publication of Firebaugh's ''Satyricon'', a version adapted for a general market was published by Liveright in 1927. It was edited by [[Charles Whibley]].

''' Sir William Fraser''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCB}} (18 February 1816 – 13 March 1898) was a solicitor and notable expert in ancient Scottish history, [[palaeography]], and [[genealogy]].

==Life==
Fraser's family came of the stock of farmers and craftsmen in [[The Mearns]]. He was born the eldest of two sons and a daughter of James Fraser (1786 - 1834), a mason, and his spouse Ann (died 1821), daughter of James Walker, tenant of the farm of Elfhill of [[Fetteresso]], about 5 miles from [[Stonehaven]]. The couple were settled and were feuholders at Links of Arduthie.

William Fraser was initially educated at a private school in Stonehaven kept by the Reverend Charles Michie, a M.A. graduate of Aberdeen's [[Marischal College]] in 1810, who spent his life teaching.

On 23 August 1830, Fraser began a five-year apprenticeship with Messrs., Brand and Burnett, solicitors in Stonehaven. He went to [[Edinburgh]] in December 1835, where he joined the firm of Hill and Tod, [[Writers to the Signet|Writers to Her Majesty's Signet]]. He continued his education at [[Edinburgh University]] in Scots Law and [[conveyancing]]. In 1838 he was taking classes in French.

It was his good fortune to be subsequently concerned in various cases requiring [[antiquary|antiquarian]] and, in particular, genealogical research, and he was thus early introduced to those studies in which he became such an expert, and steadily built up a remarkable body of knowledge which made possible his great series of fifty or so volumes on the histories of between twenty and thirty of the leading noble and landed families of Scotland.

Fraser was frequently summoned to London to give evidence before the Committee for Privileges of the [[House of Lords]]. In 1882 the [[University of Edinburgh]] conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D. In 1885 he was created a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] and in 1887 he was made a Civil [[Knight Commander of the Bath]], being invested by [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Osborne House]] on 2 August that year. The knighthood was a unique distinction for a Scottish historian at that time.

An article in the ''Dundee Advertiser'' on 1 June 1896, stated: "There is no Scotsman living who has so much experience in deciphering ancient documents, nor one who can so skillfully extract information from faded and time-worn parchments" as Sir William Fraser.

Sir William Fraser died three months after his sister Ann, who had kept house for him since 1846. They share a highly unusual and ornate grave, designed by the architect [[Arthur Forman Balfour Paul]],&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Balfour Paul&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dean Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]] just south of the northmost path in the north section of the original cemetery.

==Legacy==

The '''Sir William Fraser Chair of Scottish History and Palaeography''' at the [[University of Edinburgh]], founded in 1901, is the oldest chair of [[History of Scotland|Scottish History]]. The professorship was named after and endowed by Sir William Fraser, who gave the university £25,000 for it.{{sfn|Henderson|1901}} The chair has been held by a number of distinguished historians.

In his will he also endowed the Fraser Homes at [[Colinton]] (Edinburgh) for "authors or artists in necessitous circumstances."

He also left money for "printing works which would tend to elucidate the history and antiquities of Scotland." The nine-volume book series, ''[[The Scots Peerage]]'' (1904–1914), by Sir [[James Balfour Paul]], was used for that purpose and is dedicated to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balfour Paul|first1=James|title=The Scots Peerage|date=1904|location=Edinburgh|url=https://archive.org/details/scotspeeragefoun01paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women Who Rock''' was created in 2011 to establish an open dialogue about the portrayal of women and popular music by looking at the effects of society, culture and social justice. This community is brought together in the local Seattle area by [[University of Washington]] and [[Seattle University]] faculty members, students, community members, activists and academics in music history, gender, race and cultural/ social justice movements.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Habell-Pallán, Michelle, Sonnet Retman, Monica De La Torre, and Angelica Macklin. "WOMEN WHO ROCK." Women Who Rock Oral History Archive. University of Washington Digital Initiatives, Apr. 2013. Web. 08 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The wide variety of individuals from this community are able to introduce and collaborate with artists, musicians, media channels, activists, scholars and students in order to research, discuss and understand the role of women and popular music throughout social scenes and movements.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

This forum serves as a way to connect the music community and give light to artists who have been lost to time. This community discusses the underlying social constraints that pave the way for some artists while limiting others. They also try to outline the roots of each sound in popular music and try to give its source recognition.
The University of Washington Libraries Digital Initiatives has hosted the Women Who Rock Digital Oral History Archive since April 2013. The University of Washington works with the Women Who Rock collective by supporting their digital archive and instituting classes on the Seattle campus that represent their ideals. They continue to grow their digital network and data through documentation of scenes collected at their events.
The Women Who Rock collective hosts concerts, interviews, and conferences. They hold an annual unConference &amp; Film Festival that includes music, dance, art and media. They have had notable performers such as [[Alice Bag]], Medusa, Star Evelyn Harris and Christa Bell were featured at their events.&lt;ref&gt;Habell-Pallán, Michelle, Sonnet Retman, Monica De La Torre, and Angelica Macklin.

== Building communities ==
The Women Who Rock Archive is based on community outreach and involvement. Over the years the program has partnered with local Seattle communities, including students within and outside the University of Washington. The first collaborating students who helped co-found the project included graduate students from the GWSS Department of the University of Washington who were  mentored by Michelle Habell-Pallan and Sonnet Retman, such as: Nicole Robert, Martha González, Rebecca Clark Mane, and Kim Carter Muñoz. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.washington.edu/news/2010/12/08/these-women-rock-in-research-and-in-life&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/poczineproject/docs/women_who_rock_zine_2013&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://womenwhorockcommunity.org/who-we-are&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://simpsoncenter.org/news/2013/02/rock-archive-women-who-rock%E2%80%99s-2013-unconference-film-festival-launches-digital-oral&lt;/ref&gt;. Lulu (Luzviminda) Carpenter, an experienced Seattle organizer and head of [http://2014northwestfolklifefestival.sched.org/event/1nS1SZ9/uzuri-productions-luzviminda-lulu-carpenter Urzuri Productions],  is a main organizer of the Women Who Rock annual unConference.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.lib.washington.edu/wwrweb/building-communities/bioCarpenter_Lulu.html&lt;/ref&gt; As a faculty member at Seattle University Mako Fitts Ward ensured that the unConference bridged with women musician, performers and activists in Seattle's hip scene. Michelle Habell-Pallan and Sonnet Retman co-teach the class known as Rock the Archive: Hip Hop, Indie Rock &amp; New Media, which allows students to study women and African-American involvement in popular music culture.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Michelle Habell-Pallán, Angelica Macklin and Sonnet Retman, “Notes on Women Who Rock: Making Scenes, Building Communities: Participatory Research, Community Engagement, and Archival Practice.” NANO (New American Notes Online) special issue, "Digital Humanities, Public Humanities." July 2014. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Assignments include blog posts, video critiques, and musical analysis. Each assignment is aimed at a key theme of the project: write to rock, reel rebels, making scenes and building communities. For example, students were able to gain admission to the Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI) and learn about the legacy of Seattle hip-hop.&lt;ref&gt;"MOHAI Presents The Legacy of Seattle Hip-Hop." Museum of History and Industry. MOHAI, 25 June 2015. Web. 04 Dec. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; The project has successfully built communities both at the undergraduate and graduate level. Graduate Mentor Workshops are also provided  to allow graduate students to present their work in front of a distinguished audience within their respective field and gain critique and feedback.

== Write To Rock ==
Write to Rock is a subunit of the Women Who Rock organization, focusing on the written histories of popular music. It features many music writers ranging from scholars and critics to journalists and bloggers. With music analysis also ranging across a wide spectrum of genres and music cultures, the group’s focuses are to question and criticize previous music histories through a feminist lens, and to re-write these stories in order to include the erased contributions of women and women of color.&lt;ref&gt;Habell-Pallán, Michelle, Sonnet Retman, Monica De La Torre, and Angelica Macklin. "WOMEN WHO ROCK :: Write to Rock." Women Who Rock Oral History Archive. University of Washington Digital Initiatives, Apr. 2013. Web. 08 Dec. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; The Write to Rock archive, which also contributes to the Women Who Rock’s Digital Oral Archive, features biographies and interviews with a number of the individuals who participate with the organization as critical writers.&lt;ref&gt;Habell-Pallán, Michelle, Sonnet Retman, Monica De La Torre, and Angelica Macklin. "Women Who Rock Oral History Collection." Women Who Rock Oral History Collection. University of Washington Digital Initiatives, Apr. 2013. Web. 08 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals include: [[Daphne Brooks]], [[Sherrie Tucker]], Maylei Blackwell, María Elena Gaitán, and [[Deborah Wong]].

== Reel Rebels ==
The Women Who Rock Archive also features a number of filmmakers and producers who contribute to the archival and recognition of female artists.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The archive has worked with numerous filmmakers including Barni Qaasim, Sheila Jackson, and Karen Whitehead. Recently, they featured a screening of Her Aim Is True, a film biography of [[Jini Dellaccio]], a famous rock photographer.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Karen. "Her Aim Is True." Her Aim Is True. Word Press, n.d. Web. 08 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; By highlighting media featuring women, the group attempts to promote greater documentation of the achievements made by female artists. In this, they hope to avoid the systemic under-representation of women in music that is historically pervasive. Videos, in the form of oral histories, are one of several methods the Women Who Rock Archive uses to digitally chronicles the stories of female performers, activists, and community leaders. As of 2015 the Women Who Rock Archive  has eleven oral histories, documenting stories by [[Martha Gonzalez (musician)]], Medusa, Onion Carillo and several others.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;Two Women Who Rock media-makers and UW Gender, Women, &amp; Sexuality Studies Phd students, Angelica Macklin and Monica De La Torre worked with UW faculty Michelle Habell-Pallan and Sonnet Retman to design, curate, and produce the digital version of the Women Who Rock Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women Who Rock Oral History Archive :: Search the Archive|url = http://content.lib.washington.edu/wwrweb/search.html#credits|website = content.lib.washington.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They partnered with UW Libraries Digital Initiative Team Ann Lally, Anne Graham, Angela Rosette-Tavares, and Rinna Rem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women Who Rock Oral History Archive :: Search the Archive|url = http://content.lib.washington.edu/wwrweb/search.html#credits|website = content.lib.washington.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Making Scenes ==
The Making Scenes aspect represents the Women Who Rock organization’s outreach into the local community through events. This allows for community collaboration and dialogue about specific performers and bands. One of the main events this organization holds is an annual conference called the Women Who Rock unConference. Since 2011, this conference has been devoted to women, music, and community building. It has featured various performers including Cholo en Cello, Alice Bag, Medusa, [[Nobuko Miyamoto]], and Quetzal Flores. The conference has been digitally documented every year. Women Who Rock has received support from many organizations such as Washington Hall, Hidmo, De Cajón Project, Seattle Fandango Project, Sistah Sinema, Open Hand Reel, 4Culture, Asian Pacific Islander Women &amp; Family Safety Center, B-Girl Media, Central District Forum for Arts and Ideas, Green Bodies, Feest.org, Seattle Girls’ School Latina Affinity Group, Social HeARTistry Educators (S.H.E), Storygarden Seattle, Uzuri Productions, and Zenyu. The organization has also received extensive support from the University of Washington (UW) through the UW Diversity Research Institute, the UW Graduate School, Gender, Women, &amp; Sexuality Studies (GWSS), and American Ethnic Studies.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In an article by [[The Stranger (newspaper)|the Stranger]], a weekly alternative arts and culture newspaper, the Women Who Rock unConference in 2012 was compared to the Northwest Women’s Show held in the Centurylink's Events Center near Centurylink Field. The two events were so widely distinct in that the “unConference” promoted conversation about the politics of gender, race, class, and sexuality generated by popular music while the Northwest Women’s Show focused on dieting, Fitness, Fashion, Wine Tasting, and other aspects.&lt;ref&gt;O, Kelly. "Women Who Rock Project vs. Northwest Women's Show." The Stranger. The Stranger, 5 Mar. 2012. Web. 8 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The author pointed out the disparity between the two events and talked about how fulfilling the unConference was and the triviality of the Northwest Women’s Show.
