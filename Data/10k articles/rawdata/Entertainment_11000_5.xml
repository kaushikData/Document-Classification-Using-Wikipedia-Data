'''48Hours''' is a New Zealand film-making competition. It involves teams of various sizes competing to write, shoot, edit and score a short film, which must be between 1 and 7 minutes long (5 minutes in 2016), over a single 48-hour period. Developed from the US-based [[48 Hour Film Project]], which was run in Auckland in 2003, ''48Hours'' has been running as a New Zealand-only event since 2004. with regional competitions organised in 8 cities around [[New Zealand]]: [[Auckland]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], [[Rotorua]], [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]], [[Wellington]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]]. The 2018 competition will take place from 11–13 May 2018.

The event is organised by [[Ant Timpson|Anthony "Ant" Timpson]]. Teams attend a launch ceremony on a Friday night where each team is given a randomly selected genre within which to base their film's theme. They are also given three compulsory features which are common to all teams. These are a line of dialogue, a prop, a character, and since 2010, a "technical" element.

All creative work required to produce the film must be undertaken and completed within the 48 hours of the competition. This includes storylining, scriptwriting, filming, editing and audio mixing. Teams must deliver their finished film to the competition organisers by the Sunday evening to be eligible for prizes, although late deliveries will still be screened in the heats.

By 2011 the competition had grown to include more than 800 teams nationwide with at least 10,000 people believed to be involved.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Compulsory elements ==

Every year teams are given a number of compulsory elements to help ensure that film has been wholly created on the shoot weekend. The elements include a character with a gender-neutral name, a character trait, a line of dialogue, a prop, and as of 2010, a technical shot. As well as these, teams are randomly allocated a genre for their film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=48Hours: The top 14 go to battle|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10894609|publisher=NZ Herald|accessdate=21 November 2013|date=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2017 saw the introduction of themes, different elements, and the ULTRA48 Challenge for teams that elect to do it for added difficulty.

'''''Chilango''''' is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] monthly humour and entertainment [[magazine]] published by [[Grupo Expansión]] since November 2003 in [[Mexico City]].

==About the term ''Chilango''==
{{main|Chilango}}
In the early 21st century''[[Chilango]]'' became by an accepted [[demonym]] for people from [[Mexico City]]. The self-acceptance of the term lead to the publication of the magazine as a way to [[subvert]] [[prejudice]]s people from the inner states of Mexico had about ''chilangos'', originally created and intended by them as an offensive name.

==The magazine==
Notable sections of the magazine include:
===DFnitivo===
Word play with the Spanish pronuntiation of DF, the [[Mexican Federal District]] or ''Distrito Federal''.
A ''how-to'' style section intended as a [[parody]] of weird things that happen in the city, such as the unfinished (called [[surrealism|surreal]]) [[Distribuidor Vial]] freeway over Río Becerra or the bottles filled with water to keep away dogs and other animals from invading gardens. Most of it is real but the logic of the situation is the questioned by the article.

===Chilangoñol===
A [[Real Academia Española|RAE]] parody in which the [[Mexican Spanish]] (focused in Mexico City [[slang]]) is explained, such as the words "onda", "equis" (''[[fresa]]'' slang), "chingar" (considered offensive by some).

===Aka el DF===
Social and news sections parody ("aka" comes from "acá", but it's spelled with "k" by some). However, it's all factual.
===El pinche gringo===
Translated as ''The fucking [[gringo]]'', and disappeared by 2007, it was an unusual article completely in [[English language|English]] supposedly written by an [[United States|American]] criticising Mexico City and its way of life.
===DFondo===
The collection of cover full-length articles.
==Motto==
During its first years, the magazine's slogan was a spoof of the racist "haz patria y mata un chilango" (''perform patriotism and kill a chilango''), marked as "haz patria y ama a un chilango" (''perform [[patriotism]] and love a chilango''). Later issues included new phrases such as "la ciudad que vale la pena vivir" (''the worthy city to live'') or "haz patria y levantamiento de tarro olímpico" (''perform patriotism and olympic beer mug lifting'').

{{Culture of Moldova}}
The '''cinema of Moldova''' developed in the early 1960s during the [[USSR|Soviet]] period, experiencing a flowering of about a decade and a half. Stagnation followed, and after the [[Moldavian SSR]] became independent in 1991, the industry almost completely disappeared.

==History==

'''1897-1939'''

The beginnings of Moldovan cinema are difficult to trace, owing largely to the divergent cinematic histories of the left- and right-bank regions, a division which continues today. From 1897 to 1927, film production in Moldova was sparse and remains mostly undocumented. After Bessarabia, now part of Moldova’s current territorial boundaries, was absorbed into Romania in 1918, the USSR created the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (MASSR) on the left bank of the Dniester River in 1924. This newly created Soviet republic included land taken from Ukraine as well as modern-day Transnistria, a breakaway region that remains unrecognized by any UN-member nations. At that time, the USSR attempted to modernize and Sovietize the MASSR, which included cryrillicizing the Romanian language, industrializing the region, and educating many of the MASSR’s film professionals at the Odessa State College of Cinematography in neighboring Ukraine.

Most of the films produced by these early Moldovan film professions were documentary works, most of which were propaganda films, such as ''Protest Rally: Remember Bessarabia'' (1928), ''The Bessarabian Agricultural Community'' (1928), and ''Five Years of the MASSR'' (1928). However, the 1928 documentary ''Everything is Quiet'' is the most noteworthy film from this period and included an entirely Moldovan film crew.

Despite these efforts, the region never had its own national film studio. Throughout the MASSR’s existence, the Moldovan film industry and Ukrainian film industry were almost one and the same: in 1930, the USSR created the Moldovan cinematography department at UkraFilm, which change its title in 1934 and, again, in 1936. Additionally, many film workers involved with these early MASSR productions were Ukrainian.

'''1939-1952'''

In the right-bank region, filmmaking in Bessarabia was virtually nonexistent since its cinematic identity was bound up with that of Romania’s, which, due to devastation occasioned by World War I, was progressing at a modest pace. After the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, which effectively ceded Bessarabia to the USSR, the Soviet army invaded Bessarabia and took control of the region. From 1940 to 1944, Bessarabia experienced its biggest in the field of cinema since 1918. Several Russian-language films were subtitled in the Romanian language, and Soviet filmmakers began producing documentaries and newsreels about the region, such as ''On the Danube''.

This cinematic growth came to an end, though, when Nazi Germany and Romania, which had recently aligned itself with the Axis Powers, moved into Bessarabia and crossed the Dniester River into modern day Transnistria. Afterwards, all soviet republics’ film industries were enlisted into the war effort and, like the film industries of the Allied Powers, produced documentaries and newsreels about the USSR’s military activities.

After the USSR recaptured Bessarabia and Transnistria, both regions were devastated by the war. Chişinău, the capital city of Moldova, was almost entirely destroyed from the bombing campaigns. But the Bessarabian region also faced additional hurdles, as noted by Leonid Brezhnev: Because it was not part of the USSR during the 1920s, Bassarabia remained undeveloped in comparison with its Soviet counterparts. Hence, rapid collectivization and sovietization followed the Second World War. Although there were efforts to cultivate a Moldovan film culture in this period—Russian-language films continued to be subtitled in Romanian, the government published soviet newsreels focusing on Moldova, etc.—the cinematic situation remained stagnant until the 1950s.

'''1952-1970'''

On April 26, 1952, after much planning, the USSR Ministry of Cinematography created the Documentary Film Studio in [[Chişinău]]. During the first year two documentaries, ''Kodry'' and ''Moldovan Cannery'' appeared. However, these films, like those of the MASSR, lacked a distinctly Moldovan identity. The directors working in Moldova at this point were from Moscow and Odessa, in part because there were no trained Moldovan film professionals. Between 1952 and 1957, six documentaries were screened.

Afterwards, more Moldovan filmmakers began to participate in local productions, which caused the MSSR to take an increased interest in the state's role in developing a national film culture. To that end, on January 24, 1957, the MSSR Council of Ministers renamed the national film studio the "Studio for Fiction Movies and Chronicle Documentaries from Chişinău," also known as "[[Moldova-Film]]". Moldova-Film was far more productive than its predecessor. Funded by the State, Moldova-Film turned out 160 feature films, 1,500 documentaries and educational shorts, and over 100 animated films between 1957 and 1992. A few years later, in 1967, the MSSR founded Telefilm Chișinău, which, like Moldova-Film, received state funding and was similarly productive, producing over 300 documentaries, music videos, and telefilms during its existence.

It was during this period that many notable Moldovan filmmakers began receiving training at [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|VGIK]] in Moscow and returning to Moldova to shoot films in their home country. This allowed Moldovan cinema to develop a distinct identity. During Khruschev's thaw, which ushered increased liberties in artistic expression, Moldovan filmmakers such as Emil Loteanu and Valeriu Gagiu produced films which comprised the “Moldovan Poetic Film,” a genre which fused realism with romance and enjoyed wide appeal in the USSR.

However, as in the rest of the Soviet republics, the state exercised a considerable influence in the content of these films, and with the rise of Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary came a resurgence of official censorship. Socialist Realism, once ''de rigueur'' under Stalin’s leadership, became, again, the artistic model for film professions; and critiques of Soviet history were vehemently disfavored by party leaders. For instance, Valeriu Gagiu’s A Taste of Bread (1966), about Moldovan resistance during Stalin’s tight-fisted agricultural collectivization policies after the Second World War, elicited outrage from party leaders, despite the film’s enthusiastic reception at film festivals. Hence, in keeping with the state’s systematic suppression of Moldovan cinema and culture, the Central Committee of the Moldovan Communist Party banned the film in 1970. Other Moldovan films suffered similar fates.

'''1970-1990'''

During the post-Thaw era of the 1970s, characterized by stagnation, studios continued to curtail artistic freedoms, though there were a few artistic successes at this time, such as Emil Loteanu’s ''Lăutarii'' (1972) and ''Gypsies Are Found near Heaven'' (1976). But by the 1980s, ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' occasioned a resurgence of artistic freedom and impressive Moldovan films, like Valeriu Jereghi’s ''Iona'' (1987), Gheorghe Urschi’s ''Whoever Swears, He Pays'' (1989), and Victor Bucătaru’s ''Crucifix'' (1990).

===Filmography===
In 1957, the first fiction comedy film was called ''Cînd omul nu-i la locul lui'' (''When the man is not himself'') after a script written by Ion Druta.

In 1968, the first cartoon film, ''The Goat with Three Kids'', was released, a film inspired by Ion Creanga's fairy-tale with the same title. In 1972, the satirical series ''Usturici'' appeared.

Between 1952 and 1982, 120 fiction movies, 800 documentaries, 750 editions of the cinema magazine ''Soviet Moldova'', 40 editions of ''Usturici'' and 40 cartoons were filmed at the Moldova-Film studio. It also dubbed 12 fiction movies and 70 short stories annually by the end of the 1980s.

A cinema was built in the beginning of the 1950s in the center of Chişinău, which is now part of the Moldovan "Patria" chain.

==International recognition==
The first internationally acclaimed success was the film of Moldovan producer Mihail Kalik - ''[[Lullaby]]'' ({{lang-ru|Колыбельная}}), released in 1960 at [[Moldova-Film]] studios. The movie was awarded the "Prize for Participation" at the international cinema competition at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]], bringing attention to the emergent Moldovan film industry.

Another international success was ''Man Is Walking After the Sun'' (''Man Is Following the Sun'' {{lang-ru|Человек идет за солнцем}}), written by Valeriu Gagiu and Mihail Kalik. The world press compared this movie to the [[Albert Lamorisse]] movie ''[[Le Ballon Rouge]]'', where, just as in the Moldovan movie, the main hero was a little boy. Vadim Derbenev, the [[cameraman]], was awarded the special jury diploma at the International Cinema Festival in [[Helsinki]] for his work.

Another one of the first Moldovan films was the ''Ataman of Codru'' ({{lang-ru|Атаман кодр}}), which enjoyed success in Asia and Latin America. The viewers called the movie ''Ataman Kadyr''.

The Moldovan breakthrough in the world's cinema industry was a film written by [[Ion Druţă]] and producer and cameraman Vadim Derbenev - ''Last Month of Autumn'' ({{lang-ru|Последний месяц осени}}). The film received prizes at the [[Mar del Plata Film Festival]], including the "Sympathy Prize of Viewers". Evgueniy Lebedev was awarded the main prize of the festival - the "Big Southern Cross" - in the best male role nomination. ''[[La Nación (Buenos Aires)|La Nación]]'' described the film as a "remarkably beautiful work". ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]'' wrote "This film, amongst all the mess that flooded the cinema world invites us to the sources of the true reachess of life". Besides appraisal in [[Argentina]], the movie was awarded the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1966. At the International Film Festival Kino Pavasaris in [[Vilnius]], the director Vadim Derbenev won "Best Production". However, in Vilnius, the film was awarded only the second main film prize, the first place being taken by [[Vytautas Žalakevičius]]'s film ''[[Nobody Wanted to Die]]'' ({{lang-ru|Никто не хотел умирать}}).

''[[Lăutarii]]'' by [[Emil Loteanu]] (producer Vitaliy Kalashnikov, composer [[Eugen Doga]]) was a success, particularly in Italy. The movie received four prizes, including the "Prize of Viewers' Sympathy" and the second main prize "Silver Shell". [[Norway|Norwegian]] newspaper ''Arbeiterbladet'' compared the Moldovan movie to the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. Czech weekly ''Film a Divadlo'' wrote "Every nation expresses to the best its deepest feelings, but the Moldovan one did it the best". In 1975, the movie won in the category of "Best Foreign Film", leaving behind traditional Hollywood productions. During the week of Soviet Cinema in Naples, the film was awarded the "Silver Nymph".

''Red Meadows'' by [[Emil Loteanu]] was also another major Moldovan success at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]]. [[România Liberă]] highlighted the symbolism of this art work, which made it an unforgettable sight".

Very few films have been made in Moldova since independence: the government has failed to protect its domestic industry and funding is rare (save for occasional co-productions). The country also has the world's second-lowest cinema attendance rate.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Kokker and Cathryn Kemp. ''Romania &amp; Moldova'', p.35. Lonely Planet (2004), {{ISBN|1-74104-149-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartoons==
The animation movies produced at [[Moldova-Studios]] reach an international audience. The cartoon ''Haiduc'', produced by Leonid Gorokhov and Yuriy Katsap, with scenario written by Vlad Druc, was awarded the Grand-Prix of the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in the cartoon category.

==Personalities==
The top Soviet pop star [[Sofia Rotaru]] starred in the musical movie filmed at [[Moldova-Film]] studios called ''[[Dnestrovskiye melodiy]]''.

A '''cinematographer''' or '''director of photography''' (sometimes shortened to '''DP''' or '''DOP''') is the chief over the camera and light [[film crew|crew]]s working on a [[film]], television production or other live action piece and is responsible for making artistic and technical decisions related to the image. The study and practice of this field is referred to as [[cinematography]].

The cinematographer selects the camera, [[film stock]], [[photographic lens|lens]]es, [[filter (photography)|filter]]s, etc., to realize the scene in accordance with the intentions of the [[film director|director]]. Relations between the cinematographer and director vary; in some instances the director will allow the cinematographer complete independence; in others, the director allows little to none, even going so far as to specify exact camera placement and lens selection. Such a level of involvement is not common once the director and cinematographer have become comfortable with each other; the director will typically convey to the cinematographer what is wanted from a scene visually, and allow the cinematographer latitude in achieving that effect.

Several American cinematographers have become directors, including [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], originally the [[Coen brothers]]' DP; [[Jan de Bont]], cinematographer on films as ''[[Die Hard]]'' and ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', directed ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' and ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. In 2014, [[Wally Pfister]], cinematographer on [[Christopher Nolan]]'s [[Batman in film#Christopher Nolan|three ''Batman'' films]], made his directorial debut with ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]''; whilst British cinematographers [[Jack Cardiff]] and [[Freddie Francis]] regularly moved between the two positions.

==History==
[[File:Alex Ferrari.jpg|thumb|A cinematographer on set]]
In the infancy of motion pictures, the cinematographer was usually also the [[Film director|director]] and the person physically handling the camera. As the art form and technology evolved, a separation between director and [[camera operator]] emerged. With the advent of artificial lighting and faster (more light sensitive) [[film stock]]s, in addition to technological advancements in optics, the technical aspects of cinematography necessitated a specialist in that area.

Cinematography was key during the [[silent movie]] era; with no sound apart from [[background music]] and no dialogue, the films depended on lighting, acting, and set.

In 1919 Hollywood, the then-new motion picture capital of the world, one of the first (and still existing) trade societies was formed: the [[American Society of Cinematographers]] (ASC), which stood to recognize the cinematographer's contribution to the art and science of motion picture making. Similar trade associations have been established in other countries too.

==Societies and trade organizations==
There are a number of national associations of cinematographers which represent members (irrespective of their official titles) and which are dedicated to the advancement of cinematography. These include:

*the [[American Society of Cinematographers]] (A.S.C.)
*the [[Canadian Society of Cinematographers]] (C.S.C.)
*the [[British Society of Cinematographers]] (B.S.C.)
*the [[Australian Cinematographers Society]] (A.C.S.)
*the [[Cinematographers Guild of Korea]] (C.G.K.)
*the [[Filipino Society of Cinematographers]] (F.S.C.) 
*the [[French Society of Cinematographers]] (A.F.C.)
*the [[Italian Society of Cinematographers]] (A.I.C.) 
*the [[Indian cinematographers|Indian Society of Cinematographers]] (I.S.C.)
*the [[German Society of Cinematographers]] (BVK)
*the [[Netherlands Society of Cinematographers]] (NSC) 
*the [[Spanish Society of Cinematography Works]] (A.E.C)
*the European Federation of Cinematographers / IMAGO
*the Uruguayan Society of Cinematographers (S.C.U)

The A.S.C. defines cinematography as:
:A creative and interpretive process that culminates in the authorship of an original work of art rather than the simple recording of a physical event. Cinematography is not a subcategory of photography. Rather, photography is but one craft that the cinematographer uses in addition to other physical, organizational, managerial, interpretive and image-manipulating techniques to effect one coherent process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Comedy hip hop''' or '''comedy rap''', is a subgenre of [[hip hop music]] that is comedic in nature, often incorporating satirical lyrics. While many examples of comedy hip hop could be considered a [[parody]] of the hip hop genre, in the case of artists who merely incorporate humor into their more serious, [[wikt:purist|purist]] hip hop styles, such as [[Eminem]] and [[Ludacris]], this is not necessarily the case.

[[Run DMC]]'s "[[Christmas in Hollis]]" from 1987 is comedy rap, and [[DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince]] were solidly in the comedy rap genre with the 1988 song "[[Parents Just Don't Understand]]." [[N.W.A]] and [[Ice Cube]]'s early albums were not as comedic and lighthearted as The Fresh Prince but did incorporate humor.

Before the darker themes that are characteristic of the [[Gangsta rap]] of the 1990s, comedy hip hop, with its lighter and more humorous style, came to prominence in the 1980s,&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|last=allmusic|title=about comedy rap|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/comedy-rap-ma0000012206|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried by popular acts such as the [[Beastie Boys]]. Various influential comedy hip hop groups began in the late 1980s, such as [[DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince]], [[Kid 'n Play]], [[Das EFX]] and [[Fu-Schnickens]] and throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, rappers including [[Eminem]], [[Ludacris]] and [[Afroman]] gained popularity, as did rappers such as [[Hopsin]]. [[Rucka Rucka Ali]] is an artist who experiments with comedy hip hop filled with racism, such as his song, "What The Black Says". [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] has made entries to this music genre, along with [[Nerdcore]]. "[[Thrift Shop]]" by [[Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis]] is also a well-known song of comedy hip hop. While few rappers make comedy hip hop their focus with the exception of a few, mainly [[Lil Dicky]] and [[Ugly God]], the genre maintains a substantial loyal following.

Outside the English-speaking world, the genre spread in the 1990s, with bands and artists such as the German group [[Fettes Brot]], the [[Sweden Finns|Swedish-Finnish]] artist [[Markoolio]] and the French group Svinkels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://musicamscire.blogspot.fr/2011/10/le-comedy-rap.html |title=Le Comedy Rap |last1=Cardenas |first1=Fabricio |date=13 October 2011 |website=Musicam scire |language=fr |access-date=3 June 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comédie larmoyante''' ({{Lang-fr|tearful comedy}}) was a genre of [[France|French]] [[drama]] of the 18th century.  In this type of [[sentimental comedy]], the impending tragedy was resolved at the end, amid reconciliations and floods of tears.  Plays of this genre that ended unhappily nevertheless allowed the audience to see that a "moral triumph" had been earned for the suffering heroes and heroines.    

[[Thomas Heywood|Thomas Heywood's]] masterpiece, ''A Woman kilde with kindnesse'' (acted 1603; printed 1607), can be considered a forerunner of this genre.   

In [[Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chaussée|Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chaussée's]] ''Mélanide'', the genre is fully developed.  Comedy was no longer to provoke laughter, but tears. The innovation consisted in destroying the sharp distinction then existing between tragedy and comedy in [[French literature]]. Indications of this change had been already offered in the work of [[Pierre Carlet de Chamblain de Marivaux|Marivaux]], and La Chaussée's plays led naturally to the domestic drama of [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and of [[Michel-Jean Sedaine|Sedaine]]. 

[[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]] considered himself a supporter of this genre.

By blurring the distinctions between comedy and tragedy, the ''comédie larmoyante'' formed the basis for the subsequent genre known as ''[[Drame Bourgeois]]'', the form of realistic comedy heralded by [[Denis Diderot|Denis Diderot's]] ''Le Fils naturel'' (published 1757, performed 1771).

There are many examples of 'comédie larmoyante' in both French and Italian opera where it gave birth to the genre of [[opera semiseria]]: [[André Grétry]]'s ''[[Lucile (opera)|Lucile]]'', [[Nicolas Dalayrac]]'s [[Nina (Dalayrac)|Nina, ou La folle par amour]], [[Pasquale Anfossi]]'s ''[[La vera costanza (Anfossi)|La vera costanza]]'' (1776) and [[Joseph Haydn]]'s [[La vera costanza|work of the same name]] (1779).

'''Cue cards''', also known as '''note cards''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bognár |first=Desi K. |date=2000 |title=The International Dictionary of Broadcasting and Film |location=Boston |publisher=Focal Press |isbn=978-0-585-37622-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; are cards with words written on them that help actors and speakers remember what they have to say. They are typically used in [[television production]]s where they can be held off-camera and are unseen by the audience. Cue cards are still currently being used on many late night talk shows including ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'', ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'' and ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' as well as variety and sketch comedy shows like ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' due to the practice of last minute script changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Team Coco Podcast #25: Cue Card Master Steve Burm!|url=http://teamcoco.com/content/team-coco-podcast-25-cue-card-master-steve-burm|newspaper=Conan (talk show)|date=May 2, 2011|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other TV shows, including game and reality shows, still use cue cards due to their mobility, as a [[teleprompter]] only allows the actor or broadcaster to look directly into the camera.

== History ==

Cue cards were originally used to aid ageing actors. One early use was by [[John Barrymore]] in the late 1930s.

Cue cards however did not become widespread until 1949 when Barney McNulty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Orith |date=December 20, 2000 |title=Barney Mcnulty, 77, Cue Card Creator, Dies |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BARNEY+MCNULTY,+77,+CUE+CARD+CREATOR,+DIES-a083412398 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News|Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[CBS]] page and former military pilot, was asked to write ailing actor [[Ed Wynn]]'s script lines on large sheets of paper to help him remember his script. McNulty volunteered for this duty because his training as a pilot taught him to write very quickly and clearly. McNulty soon saw the necessity of this concept and formed the company "Ad Libs."{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} McNulty continued to be [[Bob Hope]]'s personal Cue Card man until he stopped performing. McNulty who died in 2000 at the age of 77 was known in Hollywood as the "Cue-Card King".

[[Marlon Brando]] was also a frequent user of cue cards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brando |first1=Marlon |author-link1=Marlon Brando |last2=Lindsey |first2=Robert |author-link2=Robert Lindsey (journalist) |date=1994 |title=Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me |publisher=Random House |pages=414–416 |isbn=978-0-679-41013-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; feeling that this helped bring realism and spontaneity to his performances, instead of giving the impression that he was merely reciting a writer's speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Powell |first1=Larry |first2=Tom |last2=Garrett |date=2013 |title=The Films of John G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7546">'''Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association''' is a trade association representing [[online gambling]] businesses with remote gambling licences issued in [[Gibraltar]].
&lt;!--- Write your article below this line ---&gt;

== Members ==

The GBGA is funded by its members, and the majority of remote gambling licence holders holding licences issued by the [[Gibraltar Regulatory Authority|Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner]] are members. Members include household names in the gambling industry such as [[Bet365]], [[Betfair]], [[Ladbrokes]] and [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gbga.gi/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

The GBGA's purpose is to speak on behalf of the Gibraltar remote gambling licensees on matters of legal and regulatory importance to the gambling industry, when engaging in dialogue with relevant authorities around the world. It also aims to provide governments, legislators and policy makers with a better understanding of the gambling industry and its importance to Gibraltar.&lt;ref name="GBGA Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Info|url=http://www.gbga.gi|work=GBGA|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GBGA has operated since January 2005, however in April 2013 it was incorporated into corporate form.

Peter Howitt, was appointed Chief Executive of the GBGA in May 2013.&lt;ref name="GBGA Website" /&gt; Peter is the founder of Ramparts, a law firm in Gibraltar.&lt;ref name="Legal Week" /&gt;  The GBGA also receives consultancy advice from Sir [[Peter Caruana]], the ex [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name="The Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Dominic|title=Gambling tax 'would hit Gibraltar hard'|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/leisure/article3924527.ece|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Times|date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activity ==

The GBGA stated in 2013 that it may seek a judicial review of what became the [[Gambling Act 2005|Gambling (Licensing &amp; Advertising) Act 2014]] on the basis that it breaches [[EU law]].&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|last=Hickman|first=Martin|title=Gambling firms start legal fund to fight government tax crackdown|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/gambling-firms-start-legal-fund-to-fight-government-tax-crackdown-8481422.html|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Independent|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Ramparts article on POC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=Jessica|title=The proposed UK remote gambling point of consumption regime - a solution looking for a problem?|url=http://www.ramparts.eu/publications/the-proposed-uk-remote-gambling-point-of-consumption-regime-%E2%80%93-a-solution-looking-for-a-problem|work=Ramparts|publisher=Ramparts|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act includes the introduction of a UK licensing regime and a tax on gambling of 15% in the UK (point of consumption tax). The changes to tax legislation are anticipated to raise over £300 million in UK tax revenues.&lt;ref name="Legal Week"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Lucy|title=Between a rock and a hard place - Gibraltar fights back over UK gaming restrictions|url=http://www.legalweek.com/legal-week/analysis/2298841/between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place-gibraltar-fights-back-over-uk-gaming-restrictions|work=Legal Week|publisher=Incisive Media|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Peter Howitt attended a session at [[UK Parliament]] to give oral evidence regarding the proposal, heard by MPs including [[Helen Grant (politician)|Helen Grant]] the Minister for the [[Department for Culture Media and Sport]].&lt;ref name=EGR&gt;{{cite web|last=Starkey|first=Gerard|title=Gambling Bill "terrible" and "damaging" says GBGA chief|url=http://www.egrmagazine.com/news/gambling_bill_terrible_and_damaging_says_gbga_chief|work=EGaming Review|publisher=Pageant Gaming Media Limited|accessdate=3 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110170425/http://www.egrmagazine.com/news/gambling_bill_terrible_and_damaging_says_gbga_chief|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013 the GBGA set out its proposals for an alternative passporting regime whereby gambling companies holding remote gambling licences from reputable jurisdictions could rely on their existing licence to operate in the UK without having to obtain a separate UK [[Gambling Commission]] Licence.&lt;ref name="GBGA Website" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Out-law&gt;{{cite web|last=Susan Biddle and Audrey Ferrie|title=What the gambling industry can expect in 2014|url=http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2013/december/what-the-gambling-industry-can-expect-in-2014/|work=Out-law.com|publisher=Pinsent Masons|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals can be found at [//www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmpublic/gambling/memo/gb14.htm UK Parliament Publications]

On 18 June 2014 the GBGA wrote to both the UK Government and UK Gambling Commission putting them on notice of a claim for judicial review of the Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act 2014 on the basis that the Act is 'unlawful' and 'unworkable'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Starkey|first1=Gerard|title=GBGA gives UK Government 14 day notice of legal action|url=http://www.egrmagazine.com/news/gbga_gives_uk_government_14-day_notice_of_legal_action|website=EGaming Review|publisher=Pageant Gaming Media Limited|accessdate=23 June 2014|ref=EGR letter before action|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625113053/http://www.egrmagazine.com/news/gbga_gives_uk_government_14-day_notice_of_legal_action|archivedate=25 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Nathalie|title=New gambling laws to be challenged through the courts|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/leisure/10912780/New-gambling-laws-to-be-challenged-through-the-courts.html|accessdate=23 June 2014|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=19 June 2014|ref=Telegraph LBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GBGA has an affiliate partnership with the European Betting and Gaming Association (EGBA), and is the first national member of the EGBA. This partnership is intended to enable both associations to more effectively consult at EU level on matters of importance to the gambling industry, such as anti-money laundering legislation.&lt;ref name=EGBA&gt;{{cite web|title=Online gambling: Gibraltar industry body becomes the first national member of the European Betting and Gaming Association|url=http://www.egba.eu/en/press/632/online-gambling-gibraltar-industry-body-becomes-the-first-national-member-of-the-european-online-gaming-and-betting-association%20/|work=European Betting and Gaming Association|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2705">In [[game theory]], the common ways to describe a game are the [[normal-form game|normal form]] and the [[extensive-form game|extensive form]]. The graphical form is an alternate compact representation of a game using the interaction among participants.

Consider a game with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; players with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; strategies each. We will represent the players as nodes in a graph in which each player has a [[utility function]] that depends only on him and his neighbors. As the utility function depends on fewer other players, the graphical representation would be smaller.

==Formal definition==
A graphical game is represented by a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, in which each player is represented by a node, and there is an edge between two nodes &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;  iff their utility functions are depended on the strategy which the other player will choose. Each node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has a function &lt;math&gt;u_{i}:\{1\ldots m\}^{d_{i}+1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is the degree of vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;u_{i}&lt;/math&gt; specifies the utility of player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; as a function of his strategy as well as those of his neighbors.

==The size of the game's representation==
For a general &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; players game, in which each player has &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; possible strategies, the size of a normal form representation would be &lt;math&gt;O(m^{n})&lt;/math&gt;. The size of the graphical representation for this game is &lt;math&gt;O(m^{d})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the maximal node degree in the graph. If &lt;math&gt;d\ll n&lt;/math&gt;, then the graphical game representation is much smaller.

==An example==
In case where each player's utility function depends only on one other player:
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:GraphicalGameExample.png|The graphical form of the described game
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The maximal degree of the graph is 1, and the game can be described as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; functions (tables) of size &lt;math&gt;m^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. So, the total size of the input will be &lt;math&gt;nm^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Nash equilibrium==
Finding Nash equilibrium in a game takes exponential time in the size of the representation. If the graphical representation of the game is a tree, we can find the equilibrium in polynomial time. In the general case, where the maximal degree of a node is 3 or more, the problem is [[NP-complete]].

The '''Happy Pet''' is a handheld [[digital pet]] released in Japan in 2003 by [[Bandai]].

==Gameplay==
The Happy Pet is similar to Bandai's previous release, the [[Tamagotchi]]. Like the Tamagotchi, the Happy Pet is a pixelised creature housed in a [[wearable computer|computer worn around the wrist]]. Unlike [[Tamagotchi]], which involves raising imaginary creatures, the Happy Pet involves raising a real-life animal. It operates on a touch screen. The touch screen enables the user to stroke the pet to either praise, discipline or cure the pet. The pet has intelligence and friendliness levels, depending on how well the user looks after it. However, the Happy Pet does not evolve. The three buttons can be used to feed the pet or play games with it. The buttons can also be used to see what the pet is currently thinking or feeling.

==Variations==
The first release of the Happy Pet was a [[chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]]. Later editions included [[cat]]s and [[dolphin]]s.

{{nihongo|'''''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi'''''|ハイ！ハイ！パフィー・アミユミ|Hai! Hai! Pafī AmiYumi}} is an American animated ([[anime-influenced animation|anime-influenced]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/cartoon-network-turning-japanese-with-hi-hi-puffy-amiyumi/ |title=Cartoon Network Turning Japanese with Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi |date=October 7, 2017 |accessdate=November 19, 2004 |publisher=[[Animation Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; television series created by [[Sam Register]] for [[Cartoon Network]]. Produced by [[Renegade Animation]] and [[Cartoon Network Studios]], the series stars fictionalized versions of the [[Music of Japan|Japanese]] [[pop rock]] group [[Puffy AmiYumi]]. The show premiered on November 19, 2004 and ended on June 27, 2006 with a total of three seasons and 34 episodes, leaving a total of five episodes unaired in America.

==Premise==
[[File:Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi Characters.png|220px|thumb|left|The main cast of the show. From left to right: Ami, Kaz, Yumi, Jang-Keng, and Tekirai.]]
''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi'' follows the adventures of two [[pop stars]] and best friends: [[Yumi Yoshimura]] ([[Grey DeLisle]]), a cynical, sarcastic, rough and tough [[punk rock]]er; and [[Ami Onuki]] ([[Janice Kawaye]]), a peppy, optimistic and cute schoolgirl. Both are based off the real Japanese [[Pop music|pop]] duo [[Puffy AmiYumi]], but with different appearances and exaggerated personalities. They travel around the world on their customized tour bus along with their well-intentioned yet greedy manager [[Kazuo Harada|Kaz Harada]] ([[Keone Young]]). From rocking out at a concert to hanging out in their hometown of [[Tokyo, Japan|Tokyo]], the duo take the world by storm with their musical talent, trend-setting style, and humor, dishing out lessons in J-pop justice and establishing the international language of "cool" along the way.

Secondary characters include: Jang-Keng (Grey DeLisle) and Tekirai (Janice Kawaye), the duo's pet cats who enjoy tormenting Kaz; Harmony ([[Sandy Fox]]), a six-year-old girl who is the self-proclaimed "Number One Fan" of Puffy AmiYumi and (later) Kaz and constantly stalks them; Eldwin Blair (Nathan Carlson), a sinister land developer who tries to tear down beloved places for his own selfish needs; King Chad ([[Katie Leigh]]), a selfish "bad boy" who is a master of the card game ''Stu-Pi-Doh!'' (a parody of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]''); the evil Talent Suckers (Nathan Carlson; [[Corey Burton]]), a [[vampire]] rock trio from [[Transylvania]]; and Atchan ([[Rob Paulsen]]), a caricature of Vo Atsushi (lead singer of the [[Pop music|pop]] band New Rote'ka) who speaks in third-person and thinks he is a superhero.

The animated Puffy AmiYumi travel all over the world in their tour bus. While appearing the same size as a regular bus on the outside, it appears to have enough internal space to house the girls' rooms (including full-sized beds), Kaz's room, their equipment, televisions, and computers, among other things. In the episode "Domo", Kaz refers to an upstairs area. It also seems capable of running on autopilot, as Kaz, Ami, and Yumi are sometimes sitting in the rear cabin of the bus while traveling. Occasionally, the rear door has been opened to receive packages delivered by a boy on a scooter.

During the first season, the show included [[live-action]] clips of the real Ami and Yumi making childish commentary (in English and non-subtitled Japanese) at the beginning and end of each episode. They only performed short clips at the beginning of the show during the second and third seasons. Starting with the second season, the duo was sometimes shown holding title cards introducing the cartoon segments. At the end of the episode "Sitcomi Yumi", Ami and Yumi watched television and saw the animated Kaz with the real Ami and Yumi. All of the live-action clips were produced by Freegate, Ltd.

The real PUFFY performs the cartoon's theme song (which is also in Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese in the respective regions), and many episodes feature one or more of the duo's songs playing in the background, along with music by their Puerto Rican muse [[Andy Sturmer]].

Though the characters speak English, the script intersperses their [[vernacular]] with [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speech, especially when the characters react to events that they find to be surprising. Calling out "Tasukete!" instead of "Help!" is commonly used.

==Production==
===Development===
According to Register, the target audience of the show is boys and girls from 6 to 11 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=76&amp;document=6 |title=Interview with Sam Register: Page 6 |accessdate=June 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615124038/http://animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=76&amp;document=6 |archivedate=June 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it also has a [[cult following]] of teen and adult fans of the real-life [[Ami Onuki]] and [[Yumi Yoshimura]] who make up the Japanese [[Pop music|pop]] duo [[Puffy AmiYumi]]. Register, who was a fan of the band, wished to spread its fame to other parts of the world and thus created the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=76&amp;document=4 |title=Interview with Sam Register: Page 4 |accessdate=June 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615124004/http://animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=76&amp;document=4 |archivedate=June 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series features the adventures of animated versions of the duo, who have been immensely popular in Japan since making their debut in 1996. The group now has its own U.S. albums, including a 2004 companion album to this program, and was known to viewers of Cartoon Network in the USA for performing the theme to the [[Teen Titans (TV series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]]. During production of the series, DeLisle learned some Japanese from Kawaye and Young, both of whom speak the language fluently.

The cartoon was the only one at the time produced entirely in the United States (thus making their choice of characters quite ironic), with characters designed by famed Canadian artist [[Lynne Naylor]] which got the show nominated for the coveted Annie Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HiHiPuffyAmiYumi&lt;/ref&gt; It used a combination of [[Macromedia Flash]] and traditional [[cel animation]].&lt;ref&gt;See boards drawings on [http://puffycrew.blogspot.com Puffy Crew Blog].&lt;/ref&gt; Each program was 30 minutes long (with commercials) and featured three seven-minute segments that borrow inspiration from [[Japanese animation]] (such as ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]'', the [[Sunbow Entertainment|Sunbow Productions]] animated series based on [[Hasbro]] properties, and ''[[ThunderCats (1985 TV series)|ThunderCats]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/archives/cool/05-03/puffy.html|title=Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi - What's Cool in Japan|publisher=Web Japan|date=March 2005|accessdate=June 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sam Register]] originally pitched the idea of [[Puffy AmiYumi]] having their own television series on [[Cartoon Network]] and afterwards [[Renegade Animation]] developed a test short on April 22, 2003 in hopes of making the channel greenlight the show's production. Renegade Animation originally, at first, created other Cartoon Network pilots before ''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi''; two of which feature ''Captain Sturdy''; one in 2001, entitled "Back in Action", and the other in 2003, entitled "The Originals", but they were ultimately rejected, and Renegade Animation then started working on ''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi'' starting with its pilot on April 22, 2003. The pilot was not broadcast, but was initially successful, and got the green-light from Cartoon Network. Finally, it was shown in non-full version as a preview on Cartoon Network DVDs and VHS tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6f-12EfUcA |title=Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi Pilot Promo - YouTube |publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was officially announced at Cartoon Network's upfront on February 26, 2004. It was originally planned to premiere in December 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animatedviews.com/2004/cartoon-network-unveils-new-shows/|title=Cartoon Network Unveils New Shows|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later pushed back to November 19.&lt;ref name="cnusa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/5781.html|title=Cartoon Network Offers J-Pop Hybrid|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancellation===
On October 2, 2006, the show's crew announced on their blog (puffycrew.blogspot.com) that Cartoon Network had cancelled ''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi'' after three seasons and 39 episodes due to Sam Register leaving the channel. Afterwards, the network removed all mention of the show from its website.

Cartoon Network did not acknowledge the show again until 2012, when Ami and Yumi appeared on Cartoon Network's 20th anniversary poster.

Yumi appeared in a cameo in Cartoon Network's [[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes]] special, Crossover Nexus.

A dubbed version began airing on [[TV Tokyo]]'s [[Oha Suta]] block on October 6, 2005, and started to air on January 8, 2006, on [[Cartoon Network (Japan)|Cartoon Network Japan]].

In Germany, the show aired on [[Cartoon Network (Germany)|Cartoon Network Germany]] with all episodes. It premiered in 2005 on the Cartoon Network's block of [[Kabel eins]]. The show stopped airing there after two seasons in 2006. The reason was that [[Cartoon Network Germany]] launched and most of the shows moved there.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In Australia, the show premiered on the 3 April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20050403235646/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com.au/asp/tv/default.asp&lt;/ref&gt; It stopped airing on [[Cartoon Network Australia]] in November 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5557">{{about||the real Anglo-Irish playwright of the 1760s|Isaac Bickerstaff (playwright)|Swift's friend who also used the name see|Richard Steele}}
'''Isaac Bickerstaff Esq''' was a pseudonym used by [[Jonathan Swift]] as part of a hoax to predict the death of then famous [[Almanac]]–maker and [[astrologer]] [[John Partridge (astrologer)|John Partridge]].

“All Fools' Day” (now known as [[April Fools' Day]] which falls on 1 April) was Swift’s favourite of holidays and he often used this day to aim his biting satirical wit at non-believers in an attempt to “make sin and folly bleed.”  Disgruntled by Partridge’s sarcastic attack about the “''infallible'' Church” written in his 1708 issue of Merlinus Almanac, Swift projected carefully 3 letters and one Eulogy as an elaborate plan to “predict” Partridge’s “''infallible'' death” to be revealed on April 1, All Fools' Day.

The first of the three letters, '''Predictions for the Year 1708''', published in January 1708, predicts, among other things, the death of Partridge by a “raging fever.”  The second letter, '''The Accomplishment of the First of Mr. Bickerstaff’s Predictions''', published in March 1708, Swift writes not as Bickerstaff but as a “man employed in the [[Inland Revenue|Revenue]]” where he “confirms” the imaginary Bickerstaff’s prediction. To accompany '''The Accomplishments''' Swift also publishes an [[Elegy]] for Partridge in which, typical of Swift’s satire, he blames not only Partridge, but those who purchase the Almanacs as well:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Here, five Foot deep, lies on his Back,
:A Cobler, Starmonger, and Quack;
:Who to the Stars in pure Good–will,
:Does to his best look upward still.
:Weep all you Customers that use
:His Pills, his Almanacks, or Shoes;
:And you that did your Fortunes seek,
:Step to his Grave but once a Week:
:This Earth which bears his Body’s Print,
:You’ll find has so much Vertue in’t,
:That I durst pawn my Ears ’twill tell
:Whate’er concerns you full as well,
:In Physick, Stolen Goods, or Love,
:As he himself could, when above.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The hoax, gaining immense popularity, plagued Partridge till the ''real'' end of his life. Mourners, who believed him to be dead, often kept him awake at night crying outside his window. Accounts of an undertaker arriving at his house to arrange drapes for the mourning, an elegy being printed and even a gravestone being carved, all culminate to Partridge publishing a letter in hopes to have a last word on the matter and proclaim (and reclaim) himself as living.  In 1709 Swift, writing as Bickerstaff for the last time, publishes '''A Vindication of Isaac Bickerstaff''' in which he abandons any real attempt to maintain the hoax.  Bickerstaff counter-argues Partridge's letter of proclamation disputing, “'' They were sure no man alive ever to writ such damned stuff as this''.”   He goes on to sarcastically reason that “death is defined by all Philosophers [as a] separation of the soul and body. [Partridge’s wife] has gone about for some time to every Alley in the neighborhood…''that her husband had neither life nor soul in him''.”

==Later influence==
Later in 1709, [[Richard Steele]] bolstered the release of his new paper ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' by naming the fictitious Isaac Bickerstaff Esq. as editor. ''The Tatler'' had occasional contributions from Swift, although largely written by Steele and [[Joseph Addison]].

[[Benjamin Franklin]] based the persona of "Poor Richard", the author of ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'', on Swift's Bickerstaff character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Character of Poor Richard: Its Source and Alteration|first=John F.|last=Ross|journal=PMLA|volume=55|issue=3|date=September 1940|pages=785–794|doi=10.2307/458740|jstor=458740|publisher=Modern Language Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. P. Lovecraft]] used the pseudonym "Isaac Bickerstaffe [sic], Jr." in 1914 for a series of letters to the editor of ''The Providence Evening News'', refuting the predictions of an astrologer the paper published.&lt;ref&gt;''H. P. Lovecraft Collected Essays, Volume 3: Science'', edited by [[S. T. Joshi]]. New York: [[Hippocampus Press]], 2005, pp. 11, 260-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian caricaturist Don Evans (born Toronto, 1936) published in 1975-85 three volumes of cartoons under the pseudonym Isaac Bickerstaff.  He lives in Orillia, Ontario, where he is active in local politics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orilliapacket.com/2014/07/18/evans-looking-for-return-to-council
&lt;/ref&gt; Personal archives including 300 drawings are at the University of Calgary.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucalgary.ca/lib-old/SpecColl/bickers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel ''[[The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society]]'' (2008) and its [[The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (film)|eponymous 2018 film adaptation]], the lead character, author Juliet Ashton, writes under the pen name Izzy Bickerstaff.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6261">A '''Japanese variety show''' is an [[entertainment]] [[television program]] made up of a variety of original [[stunt]]s, [[music]]al performances, [[comedy]] skits, [[quiz]] contests, and other acts. Japanese variety shows are predominately made to be weird and extremely fast-paced as for entertainment purposes and are primarily scheduled during prime television time. They usually feature a variety of hosts that include, but are not limited to celebrities, comedians, J-pop Idols, and so on. The typical Variety show will typically involve eating weird or disgusting things, playing games, odd questions, and more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/japanese-variety-shows]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Japanese variety shows have been around since the 1950s and there are many of them. There are Variety shows that deal with eating weird foods to playing weird games. Japanese Variety shows see a lot of interest in the United States and a lot of Japan is classified and stereotyped because of these variety shows. There are a variety of memes that are circulating around the world that try to show how "weird" Japan is. People were drawn to these quiz like shows with their bizarre questions and impossible scenarios. Watching people make fools of themselves was extremely entertaining and to think it all started with a basic game show that was similar to charades called "Gesture". The second longest-running Japanese television show, which is a comedy, is "Shoten" which began running in 1966 on Nippon TV. Television in Japan made a big impact in the 1930s but then was put to a halt because of WWII.&lt;ref&gt;[[Television in Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}} After WWII NHK and Nippon television were able to start up again around 1953. One of the first shows to have started on Nippon TV was "Downtown no Gaki Tsukai ya Arahende", which started in 1989 and is still running to this day with 1378 episodes as of Oct 29, 2017. Takeshi's Castle is yet another older show that had aired between 1986 and 1990 with 133 episodes total.&lt;ref&gt;[[Takeshi's Castle]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}}

==Current situation==
Japanese television programs such as [[Music Station]] and [[Utaban]] continue in an almost pristine format from the same [[variety shows]] of years before. The only major changes have been the increasing disappearance of live backup music since the 1980s.

A once-popular host [[Kyosen Ōhashi]] said, "Weird shows that are called Variety only exists in Japan."&lt;ref&gt;Nikkei Business (January 30, 1995 Edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more well-circulated clips &lt;!-- I have found no evidence of anyone calling the clip controversial, and have therefore removed the 'controversial' comment until a citation can be provided with a link to a RELIABLE source that holds weight. --&gt;is a segment in [[Gaki no Tsukai]], hosted by the comedy duo [[Downtown (owarai)|Downtown]]. In one part, if the male contestants fail to say a tongue-twister correctly, they get hit in the [[Groin|crotch]] by a spring-loaded pole (The Chinko Machine, or, literally, the Penis Machine), causing great pain. [[Hitoshi Matsumoto]] attempted to withdraw but the host - his comedy partner and co-host [[Masatoshi Hamada]], cajoled him back on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJbqZoZv_Ws]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLz6guCuWWw&amp;feature=related]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences overseas==
Japanese [[game show]]s have gained popularity around the world in recent years. ''Hole in the Wall'' or ''[[Brain Wall]]'' have sold rights to countries like Russia, China, Argentina and Australia. America has even caught on to adapting some of these quirky style game shows. Both FOX and ABC have purchased rights to different versions of some popular Japanese Games Shows set to air in the Summer and Fall of 2008. One of the popular names that premiered on ABC was "I survived a Japanese Game Show". Another one that was an adaptation of "I survived a Japanese Game Show." is "Japanizi" which wasn't premiered on the typical FOX or ABC, but was premiered on Disney XD and YTV in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/the-misunderstood-history-of-the-wacky-japanese-game-show/281825/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080331abc03 Breaking News - Abc Announces Its Summer Schedule With The Premiere Of Eight Original Series | Thefutoncritic.Com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] has been sued by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System)]] for their ''[[Wipeout (2008 U.S. game show)|Wipeout]]'' program allegedly copying ''[[Sasuke (TV series)|Sasuke]]'' and ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/081007/gnj0810071200020-n1.htm |title=「風雲！たけし城」酷似！TBSが米ABCを提訴 |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2008-10-07 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007220815/http://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/081007/gnj0810071200020-n1.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] also has its own version of ''[[Hole in the Wall (UK game show)|Hole in the Wall]]'' in the United Kingdom, while [[Cartoon Network]] has the American version of [[Hole in the Wall (U.S. game show)#Cartoon Network version|''Hole in the Wall'']] with [[Teck Holmes]].

Sweden also had a version of their own Japanese game show that was titled "Hjälp! Jag är med i en japansk tv-show", which literally translates to "Help! I am in a Japanese T.V. Show." They did take most of the idea from the American "I survived a Japanese Game Show" and made it their own.&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Hjälp! Jag är med i en japansk tv-show]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5395">'''Jest book'''s (or '''Jestbooks''') are collections of [[jokes]] and humorous anecdotes in book form - a literary genre which reached its greatest importance in the [[early modern period]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol 1 p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The oldest surviving collection of jokes is the Byzantine ''[[Philogelos]]'' from the first millennium.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol 1 p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Europe, the medieval [[fabliau]]&lt;ref&gt;B. Ford ed., ''The Age of Shakespeare'' (1973) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; and the Arab/Italian [[novella]]&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol 1 p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;
built up a large body of humorous tales; but it was only with the ''[[Facetiae]]'' of [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini|Poggio]] (1451) that the anecdote first appears rendered down into joke form (with prominent punchline) in an early modern collection.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol 1 p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his immediate successors [[Heinrich Bebel]] and [[Girolamo Morlini]], Poggio translated his folk material from their original language into Latin, the universal European language of the time.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol 1 p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; From such universal collections, developed the particular vernacular jestbooks of the various European countries in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/213/0509.html Jest books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elizabethan jestbooks==

===Characteristics===
Tudor and Stuart jest books were typically anonymous collections of individual jests in English,&lt;ref&gt;Linda Woodbridge, ''Vagrancy, Homelessness and English Renaissance Literature'' (2001) p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; a mix of verse and prose perhaps more comparable to the latter-day magazine than to a normal book.&lt;ref&gt;B. Ford ed., ''The Age of Shakespeare'' (1973) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Some, however (following a German model), did attempt to link their jokes into a [[picaresque]] sort of narrative around one, often [[Rogue (vagrant)|roguish]] hero, as with [[Richard Tarlton]].&lt;ref&gt;Linda Woodbridge, ''Vagrancy, Homelessness and English Renaissance Literature'' (2001) p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

Jest books took a generally mocking tone,&lt;ref&gt;B. Ford ed., ''The Age of Shakespeare'' (1973) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  with civility, and social superiors like the 'stupid scholar' as favourite targets.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol 1 p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
The low-life, realistic tone of the jest book, akin to [[coney-catching]] pamphlets, fed into the early English novels (or at least prose fiction) of writers like [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Thomas Deloney]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Ford ed., ''The Age of Shakespeare'' (1973) p. 73 and p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Jestbooks also contributed to popular stage entertainment, through such dramatists as [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] and [[Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Ford ed., ''The Age of Shakespeare'' (1973) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Playbooks and jestbooks were treated as forms of light entertainment, with jokes from the one being recycled in the other, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;M. Straznicky, ''The Book of the Play'' (2006) p. 39 and p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
Advances in printing meant that quantitatively jestbooks reached their greatest circulation in the 17th and 18th centuries; but qualitatively their contents was increasingly either a repetition of earlier publications or an artificial imitation of what had in the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] jest book been a genuine folk content.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol 1 p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bowdlerisation]] in the 19th century completed the fall of the English-language jest book from Elizabethan vitality to subsequent triviality.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol 1 p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel traditions==
*French jestbooks were widely drawn on in the work of [[Rabelais]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/213/0509.html Jest books]&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably at least, the French jestbook tradition survived unbowdlerised into the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol 1 p. 28 and p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;
*Germany had a rich tradition of jestbooks, with [[Till Eulenspiegel]] as a prominent character.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n_M8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=jestbooks+germany&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZzbARyuo4Y&amp;sig=F8DuGW36q1nMokOSGESYodwJhoE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cMA-UsD2KPTu0gX37IHoAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=jestbooks%20germany&amp;f=false Jest books]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first American jest book was published in 1787, and thereafter the genre flourished for some half a century, before giving way to the twin influence of censorship and the rise of the comic almanac.&lt;ref&gt;F. Shuffleton, ''A Mixed Race'' (1993) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jesus and Mo''''' is a British [[webcomic]] created by an artist using the [[pseudonym]] Mohammed Jones. Launched in November 2005, the comic is published on its [[eponym]]ous website once a week now.

==Set-up==
The comic is simply drawn, typically using a single image for each face, each of which is duplicated for each panel in the strip.  It features two present-day religious [[prophet]]s, Jesus and Mo.  While '''Jesus''' is portrayed as the bona fide [[Christian]] [[Jesus]], '''Mo''' claims to be a [[body double]],&lt;ref&gt;Jesus and Mo [http://www.jesusandmo.net/comic/body/ 24 November 2005: body]&lt;/ref&gt; using [[casuistry]] to circumvent the [[Islamic]] restriction against [[Depictions of Muhammad|pictorial depictions of]] [[Muhammad]].

Jesus and Mo share a flat&lt;ref&gt;Jesus and Mo [http://www.jesusandmo.net/comic/mess/ 23 March 2006: mess]&lt;/ref&gt; (and a bed), and occasionally venture outside, principally to a [[public house]], ''The Cock and Bull'', where they drink [[Guinness]] and engage in conversation and debate with an [[Atheism|atheist]] female [[bartender]] known simply as Barmaid, who is [[Unseen character|never drawn]]&lt;ref&gt;Jesus and Mo [http://www.jesusandmo.net/comic/baby/ 8 February 2006: baby]&lt;/ref&gt; but is characterised only as an out-of-frame [[Speech balloon|speech bubble]]. The barmaid functions as the voice of reason when criticising the [[Abrahamic religions]] or religion in general. Other times, Jesus or Mo may act as the voice of reason depending on which religion a particular comic aims to criticise. Jesus will act as the author's mouthpiece if the comic aims to criticise Islam while the character Mo will be used to criticise Christianity. They also converse with each other on a park bench.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus and Mo [http://www.jesusandmo.net/comic/slow/ 14 July 2006: slow]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abrahamic prophet [[Moses]] appears in some cartoons. The [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity [[Ganesha|Ganesh]] made a one-time appearance; both Jesus and Mo mocked his depicted weight and four arms.  [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of Mormonism, has also appeared: his face hidden by a hat, a reference to Smith supposedly reading seeing stones by putting them inside a stovepipe hat and sticking his face inside.

In the comic for 24 September 2008, the author used animation (blinking eyes) in the final panel.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus and Mo [http://www.jesusandmo.net/comic/cult/ 24 September 2008: cult]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the strip released on 10 November 2009, both of the principal figures were redrawn in a somewhat cleaner style.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus and Mo [http://www.jesusandmo.net/comic/role/ 10 November 2009: role]; see in particular the author's comment [http://www.jesusandmo.net/comic/role/#comment-158114 on the change in style].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
The comic consists mainly of [[religious satire]], often criticising arguments for religion,&lt;ref&gt;Jesus and Mo [http://www.jesusandmo.net/comic/sense/ 10 August 2007: sense]&lt;/ref&gt; [[religious text]]s&lt;ref&gt;Jesus and Mo [http://www.jesusandmo.net/comic/wait/ 16 May 2006: wait]&lt;/ref&gt; and decrees&lt;ref&gt;Jesus and Mo [http://www.jesusandmo.net/comic/grief/ 17 July 2007: grief]&lt;/ref&gt; and the actions of believers.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus and Mo [http://www.jesusandmo.net/comic/press/ 21 August 2007: press]&lt;/ref&gt; As the comic centres on Christian and Muslim figures, the satire is generally directed at the two religions, though some critiques apply to many forms of [[theism]].

==In print==
Episodes from ''Jesus and Mo'' have been published in paperback. Strips 1–50 are published in ''Vol 1 "Where's the soap?"'' and strips 51–100 in ''Vol 2 "Transubstantiated"''. ''Vol 3 "Things Not Seen"'' contains strips 101–140, as well as 10 previously unreleased strips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jesusandmo.net/the-shop Jesus and Mo's Bookshop]&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth [[compendium]] of 140 strips '"Big Al"' was published in 2008. All print copies are published by [[lulu.com|Lulu]].

The strip is published sporadically in the British magazine ''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]''.  Three strips were printed in the Danish newspaper ''[[Dagbladet Information|Information]]''&lt;ref name="comixtalk"&gt;comixtalk{{full|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in their online version on 2007-03-22.&lt;ref name="comixtalk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nielsen{{full|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
Members of the [[London School of Economics]] [[National Federation of Atheist, Humanist and Secular Student Societies|Atheist, Secularist and Humanist  Society]] were ordered to cover-up their Jesus and Mo T-shirts at the [[LSE Students' Union]] [[Freshers' Fair]] in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/oct/08/censoring-atheists-lse-oppression-religion Censoring atheists at LSE is a victory for oppression | Ally Fogg | Opinion | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/05/lse-student-t-shirts_n_4048881.html LSE Students Outrage After They Are Told To Cover Up 'Offensive' Jesus And Mohammed T-Shirts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/jackrivlin/100010962/jesus-and-mohammed-t-shirts-banned-victory-for-the-sanctimonious-little-prigs-of-lses-student-union/ | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Jesus and Mohammed T-shirts banned: victory for the 'sanctimonious little prigs' of LSE's student union | date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new comic was published in response.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus and Mo [http://www.jesusandmo.net/comic/anti/ 4 October 2013: anti]&lt;/ref&gt;
In December, the University apologised for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2013/12/victory-for-free-expression-as-lse-issue-public-apology-over-jesus-and-mo-controversy National Secular Society - NSS welcomes LSE apology over Jesus &amp; Mo debacle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] politician [[Maajid Nawaz]] tweeted a picture of one of the ''Jesus and Mo'' T-shirts, after the cartoon came up in a discussion on a BBC programme ''[[The Big Questions]]''. On the programme, the production team stopped participants from being shown wearing T-shirts with the cartoon, which depicted Jesus saying "Hey" and "Mo" saying "How ya doing?".&lt;ref name="Cohen25"&gt;Nick Cohen [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/25/liberal-democrats-t-shirt-jesus-muhammad-religion?CMP=twt_gu "The Liberal Democrats face a true test of liberty"], ''The Observer'', 25 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC had feared a hostile response from some Muslims.&lt;ref name="Cohen25"/&gt; On [[Twitter]], Nawaz later wrote that he did not find the T-shirts offensive and claimed he received death threats for this stance.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Perry [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/10588267/Lib-Dem-candidate-receives-death-threats-for-tweeting-Prophet-Mohammed-cartoon.html "Lib Dem candidate receives death threats for tweeting Prophet Mohammed cartoon"] ''Daily Telegraph'' 21 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Sept''''' is a 1989 [[Promotional recording|promotional album]] of music for [[La Sept]] written by [[Michael Nyman]] and performed by the [[Michael Nyman Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/550324 |title=Michael Nyman - La Sept, Suite (CD) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is Nyman's fourteenth release.  [[Gabrielle Lester]] makes her debut with the band on this album.  After a 13-year hiatus (at least from recording) with the band, she would replace the departing [[Alexander Balanescu]] as [[concertmaster]] for The Michael Nyman Band during the recording of ''[[Facing Goya]]'', and, as of 2008, remains in that position.  Musical passages created for La Sept were later re-used for the piece ''The Final Score'' which is featured in the album [[After Extra Time (album)|After Extra Time]].

{{nihongo|'''Mari Kotani'''|小谷 真理|Kotani Mari|extra=born in [[Toyama Prefecture]] on July 11, 1958&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kanazawa21.jp/designgallery/en/kaidayuji.html 21st Century Museum Of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa: Design Gallery Exhibition "Monster and the Dream of 20th Century:  Yuji Kaida Exhibition - Genealogy of Fantasy and Romance to the 21st Century" Profile: Mari Kotani]&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[science fiction]] critic, best known as the author of ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise|Evangelion]] as the Immaculate Virgin'' (Tokyo: Magazine House, 1997) and of *''Joseijou muishiki: techno-gynesis josei SF-ron josetsu''. Tokyo: Keiso shobo, 1994. ''(Techno-Gynesis: The Political Unconscious of Feminist Science Fiction)'', which won the 15th [[Nihon SF Taisho Award]].

Kotani is one of the founders of the [[Sense of Gender Award]] and The [[Japanese Association of Feminist Science Fiction and Fantasy]]. She is now the chair of the Japan [[International PEN|PEN]] Women Writers Committee and a member of the [[Science Fiction Writers of Japan]].

== "Textual harassment" lawsuit ==
On 1997, the publisher [[MediaWorks (publisher)|Media Works]] published a [[reference]] book, ''Alternative Culture'', which contained an article describing Kotani's book ''Evangelion as the Immaculate Virgin'' describing her name as a pseudonym for her husband [[Takayuki Tatsumi]] a professor of English at [[Keio University]]. When her complaints were ignored, she sued the author of the entry (Hiroo Yamagata), the publisher and [[Shufu-no-Tomo-sha]], the distributor of the book, for what she termed "[[textual harassment]]." The lawsuit was broadly supported by Japanese writers. The Japan [[PEN Club]] established a Women Writer's Committee, with feminist critic [[Kazuko Saegusa]] as chair, and Kotani as sub-chair. During this period, Kotani and Maki Honda's translation of [[Joanna Russ]]' ''[[How to Suppress Women's Writing]]'' received by major feminist critics in Japan including [[Chizuko Ueno]], [[Fukuko Kobayashi]], [[Yuko Matsumoto]], and [[Kazuko Takemura]]. In 2001 the defendants were ordered to pay Kotani 3,300,000 yen (roughly [[United States dollar|$]]27,500), and to publish an apology on the top page of  their respective website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enjoy.pial.jp/~fdi/Eng.index.html Report by Kotani on lawsuit results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005023343/http://enjoy.pial.jp/~fdi/Eng.index.html |date=2008-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosplay ==
Kotani was not the first cosplayer in Japan but she is the earliest documented instance of [[cosplay]] at a fan event in that country.  She attended a costume party at the [[Nihon SF Taikai|17th Nihon SF Taikai]] (also known as "Ashinocon") [[science fiction convention]] in 1978 wearing a costume based on the cover art for [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' novel ''[[A Fighting Man of Mars]]''.&lt;ref name="Ohwada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Mari Kotani, Pioneer of Japanese Cosplay - Origins|work=An Introduction to Japanese Subcultures|first=Toshiyuki|last=Ohwada|first2=Mari|last2=Kotani|url=https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/intro-to-japanese-subculture/0/steps/23609|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502163635/https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/intro-to-japanese-subculture/0/steps/23609|archivedate=2017-05-02|accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2004|first=Matthew|last=Thorn|chapter=Girls and Women Getting Out of Hand|title=Fanning the Flames: Fans and Consumer Culture in Contemporary Japan|editor-first=William W.|editor-last=Kelly|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|isbn=9780791460320|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This costume has sometimes been misreported as a Triton costume (from the manga ''[[Triton of the Sea]]'') due to its visual similarity and because Kotani was known at the time as a member of the TRITON fan club.&lt;ref name="Ohwada" /&gt;  She was one of about the twenty people at the event wearing a costume; the others were either members of the same ''Triton of the Sea'' fan club or of {{Nihongo|Kansai Entertainers|西芸人人|Kansai Geinin}}, the antecedent of the [[Gainax]] anime studio.&lt;ref name="Ohwada" /&gt;  Despite being a costume party, most attendees wore ordinary clothing.&lt;ref name="Ohwada" /&gt;

The Museo Teatrale alla Scala is a theatrical museum and library attached to the [[Teatro alla Scala]] in [[Milan]], [[Italy]]. Although it has a particular focus on the history of opera and of that opera house, its scope extends to Italian theatrical history in general, and includes displays relating, for example, to the commedia dell'arte and to the famous stage actress [[Eleonora Duse]].

The museum, which is adjacent to the opera house in the [[Piazza della Scala]], was opened on 8 March 1913 and was based on a large private collection which had been purchased at auction two years earlier, with funds raised both from government and private sources. The displays include costumes, [[set design]]s, autograph scores, and musical instruments of historical interest as well as paintings of musicians and actors, and a range of related paraphernalia including precious ceramic figures portraying characters from the commedia dell'arte, and [[board game]]s which used to be played in the theatre's foyer.

The '''Biblioteca Livia Simoni''', the museum's library, is situated at the II floor of the Museum. It was formed in 1952 with 40,000 volumes donated by author and ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' critic [[Renato Simoni]]; it is named in honour of his mother. Today it holds some 140,000 works related to theatre history, opera and ballet including [[libretto]]s, periodicals and the correspondence of musicians, actors and dancers, as well as books.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18496">'''Music''' plays an important role on the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] [[television drama]] '''''[[The Shield]]'''''.
Stylistically, the music ranged from [[hip hop]] ([[Master P]]) to  mainstream [[pop music|pop]] ([[Duran Duran]]) to [[Rock music|rock]] ([[Kid Rock]]) to [[country music]] ([[Johnny Cash]]), often within a single episode.

==Opening and end credits==
The [[opening credits]] for each episode displays each starring cast member's name on a black screen interspersed with scenes from the episode. Usually at a poignant moment, an excerpt of the show's theme is played, leading into the show's logo and the listing of series creator [[Shawn Ryan]].  The theme is played in full during the [[closing credits]]. The tune is "Just Another Day", by Vivian Ann Romero, Ernesto J. Bautista &amp; Rodney Alejandro.

==Music throughout the episodes==
Most episodes use a unique piece of music during the opening or closing [[montage sequence]]. Often the song signals the characters' emotional mood or the episode's themes.  The show's characters visibly listen to music. The show makes little other use of background music.

A '''nightclub act''' is a production, usually of '''nightclub music''' or '''comedy''', designed for performance at a [[nightclub]], a type of drinking establishment, by a '''nightclub performer''' such as a '''nightclub singer''' or '''nightclub dancer''', whose performance may also be referred to as a ''nightclub act''. A scheduled performance, such as a wedding gig, is a '''club date'''.&lt;ref name="Church"&gt;Church , Joseph (2015). ''Music Direction for the Stage: A View from the Podium'', p.57-8. Oxford University. {{ISBN|9780199993413}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Acts may resemble [[revue]]s and, "a good part of the music heard in nightclubs is [[standard (music)|standard]] [[traditional pop music|popular]] song ([[jazz standard]]s and the so-called [[Great American Songbook]]) and [[theatre music|theater music]] repertoire...comedy songs, [[novelty song]]s, and the occasional [[torch song]]."&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt; "[[Cabaret]], literally, is a subset of nightclub performance...In actual modern usage the terms 'nightclub' and 'cabaret' are virtually interchangeable."&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt;{{efn|''Cabaret'' is derived from ''[[tavern]]'' probably from [[Middle Dutch]] ''cambret''. The word cabaret came to mean "a restaurant or night club" by 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=c&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title= Cabaret|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|What distinguishes stage performance in a nightclub or club date setting is the breaking down of the "[[fourth wall]]," the invisible barrier between audience and performer that separates their realities. The audience's disbelief doesn't have to be suspended for more than the length of a song.&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt;}}

The [[role (fiction)|role]] of the female nightclub singer occurs frequently in fiction: books, movies, television, and even songs; she may serve as [[temptress]], [[kidnapping]] or abuse victim, [[femme fatale]], [[gun moll|gangster moll]], [[prostitute]], or as a [[double agent]]. Due to censorship, nightclub singer was and is often used to replace a prostitute's character in adaptations of books to movies.

Nightclub acts were more common in the past, as modern nightclubs have moved towards [[dance music]], [[DJ]]s, and [[rave]] like environments.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} However, musicians such as [[David Bowie]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have played nightclub singers in [[music video]]s and live performances.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In New York City, since 1985, successful, enduring, or innovative cabaret acts have been honored by the annual [[Bistro Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Kevin Scott.

'''''Pink Panther and Sons''''' is an American [[animated television series]] produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]]&lt;ref name="broadcasting19840416"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1984-04-16|title=Saturday morning switching at NBC|journal=Broadcasting|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Mirisch Company|Mirisch-Geoffrey]]-[[DePatie–Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]]. The series was originally broadcast on [[NBC]] from 1984 to 1985 and moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1986. [[Friz Freleng]] (a close friend of [[Joseph Barbera|Joe Barbera]]) served as creative producer for the series as his and [[David H. DePatie]]'s production company, DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, existed as an in-name-only enterprise by this time, as its operations were absorbed by [[Marvel Productions]] in 1981.

==Plot==
The series centers on [[Pink Panther (character)|The Pink Panther]]'s two sons: pre-teen Pinky, his brother, toddler Panky and their friends in the Rainbow Panthers crew (the pretty Chatta, fighting Rocko, gibbersh-talking Murfel, overalls-wearing Anney, and mixed-up-talking Punkin). Each episode shows the Rainbow Panthers coming together for friendship and fun as they learn all about growing up and caring for each other as they take on a group of lions called the Howl Angels.

Featured in each episode would be short three to five minutes cartoons featuring The Pink Panther bookending the main cartoons with Pinky and Panky.

==Characters==

===Rainbow Panthers===
* Pinky (voiced by Billy Bowles) - Pinky is a very polite young panther. Pinky generally ends up getting in the most danger in situations, such as turning six inches tall in one episode, and is the one who comes up with most of the ideas. He is in love with Chatta, a purple panther in the group.
* Panky (voiced by [[Betty Jean Ward|B.J. Ward]]) – Panky is Pinky's little brother. His diaper is never tied correctly so he just holds it wherever he goes. Since he is still a toddler, he is considered very impressionable.
* Chatta (voiced by [[Sherry Lynn]]) – Chatta is a purple panther. She is in love with Pinky and often tries to impress him to win his affection. She also has an enormous vocabulary.
* Murfel (voiced by Shane McCob) – Murfel is a green panther who wears an oversized knit cap. He muffles or mixes up everything that he says.
* Rocko (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) – Rocko is a yellow panther who is very athletic. He is always seen sporting boxing gloves.
* Anney O'Gizmo (voiced by [[Jeannie Elias]]) – Anney is a red panther wearing overalls and is the most scientific of the group.
* Punkin (voiced by B.J. Ward) – Punkin is a blue panther who wears a baseball cap and a wooly jumper. He is rather dense.
* The Pink Panther – He is the mute father of Pinky and Panky.

===Howl Angels===
* Finko (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) – Finko is the leader of the Howl Angels. He is a rival to Pinky and one time was babysitter to Panky at the time when Pinky and Chatta go on a date to the movies.
* Howl (voiced by [[Marshall Efron]]) – Howl is a right-hand man to Finko.
* Liona (voiced by [[Jeannie Elias]]) – Liona is a lioness, she is tough but pretty, she has a crush on Rainbow Panthers club leader Pinky. She and Chatta fight for his affection.

==Other Media==
A children's book based on the series called ''Pink Panther: Fun at the Picnic'' was based on the series. Unlike the cartoon series, the Pink Panther is shown speaking. The story was where the Pink Panther had been hired as a magician for a party and asked Pinky to assist him, upsetting Panky who left out. The Pink Panther decides to start his act creating "two Pink Panthers!" displaying Pinky and Panky onstage.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sheinberg.jpg|thumb|250px|Sid Sheinberg]] --&gt;
'''Sidney Jay "Sid" Sheinberg''' (born January 14, 1935) is an [[United States|American]] lawyer and entertainment executive. He served as President and COO of [[MCA Inc.]] and [[Universal Studios]] for over 40 years.

==Early life and education==
Sheinberg, the son of [[Judaism|Jewish]] immigrants, a Ukrainian mother and a Polish father, grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas where he was born on January 14, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard F. Dick|title=City of dreams: the making and remaking of Universal Pictures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5gzKoozo6sC&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=173|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=1997|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/11/business/now-lawyers-are-hollywood-superstars.html?pagewanted=all New York Times: "NOW LAWYERS ARE HOLLYWOOD SUPERSTARS" by Aljean Harmetz"] January 11, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Sheinberg graduated from [[Columbia University]] and subsequently attended [[Columbia Law School]], as both a Harlan Fiske Stone and James Kent Scholar, where he obtained his JD.&lt;ref name="City of Dreams, page 173"&gt;City of Dreams, page 173&lt;/ref&gt; Sheinberg is a recipient of [[Columbia Law School]]'s highest honors awarded to alumni: the Medal of Excellence and the [[John Jay Award]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Career==
In the summer of 1958, he arrived in California where he accepted a teaching position at [[UCLA School of Law]]. In 1959 while awaiting the results of his California Bar Examination, Sid joined the legal department of [[Revue Productions]], the former television subsidiary of [[MCA Inc.]], and began his career in the entertainment industry.&lt;ref name="City of Dreams, page 173"/&gt; In the late 1960s, Sheinberg had seen [[Steven Spielberg]]'s first short film, [[Amblin'|Amblin]], and signed the director, then 20, to a contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/schindler-ar1.html|title=The New York Times: Best Pictures|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheinberg gave [[Steven Spielberg]] his first job in 1968.&lt;ref name="reporterstevensidney"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Bill|title=Steven Spielberg and Sidney Sheinberg|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steven-spielberg-sidney-sheinberg-59773|accessdate=August 16, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having the benefit of being guided by [[Lew Wasserman]], Sheinberg acknowledged that an essential part of being a mentor is having confidence in the people you're guiding and mentoring. Together they transformed Universal from a second-string studio, dependent on its TV productions, into a major player.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In June 1973, Sheinberg was elected President and Chief Operating Officer of MCA, Inc. and Universal Studios, serving alongside [[Lew Wasserman]].  Sheinberg is credited with discovering director [[Steven Spielberg]] and signing him to the MCA/Universal Television division under a 7-year contract.  Sheinberg told him, "a lot of people will stick with you in success; I'll stick with you in failure."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steven-spielberg-sidney-sheinberg-59773&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Sheinberg's leadership, Universal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-03-26/business/fi-570_1_million-mca-president|title=MCA paid its president about $4.5 million in 1985|work=LA Times|date=March 26, 1986|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; released the highest-grossing films of the last three decades of the twentieth century. Those films being Universal/Spielberg projects, beginning with 1975's ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', 1982's ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and concluding with 1993's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.

During pre-production, "[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]" was always on thin ice. Sheinberg attached Spielberg to the project and despite many headwinds, pushed for the picture to be released. When 1975's Jaws ran over budget, Sheinberg had Spielberg's back — what skeptics dismissed as an overpriced B-movie became a horror classic that defined the new summer-blockbuster genre. (The $471 million it collected worldwide would be more than $1.9 billion today.)&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Steven Spielberg and Sidney Sheinberg|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steven-spielberg-sidney-sheinberg-59773|website=Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other high-performing films credited to him are ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993) and ''[[Back to the Future (film)|Back to the Future]]'' (1985). Sheinberg famously wanted to change the name from "Back to the Future" to "Space Man From Pluto" despite the film having nothing to do with outer space, spacemen, or the dwarf planet Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yywEtdz5pIsC&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Steven Spielberg: Groundbreaking Director|author=Sue Vander Hook|publisher=ABDO Group|year=2010|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[Thomas Keneally]] published his historical novel ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'', which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980. Sheinberg sent director Spielberg a copy of the book along with a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review. Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg made ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' first. Spielberg later said, "He knew that once I had directed ''Schindler'' I wouldn't be able to do ''Jurassic Park''." The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable. Spielberg forewent a salary for the film, calling it "[[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]]", and believed the film would flop. The film was a box office success, bringing in over $320 million and is considered a historic motion picture that poignantly captured the holocaust.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"/&gt;

Sheinberg saw significant opportunity in the music industry and led MCA Music Entertainment's (later renamed [[Universal Music Group]]) acquisition of [[Motown]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-29/business/fi-4916_1_motown-records|title=Berry Gordy Sells Motown Records for $61 Million|last=BATES|first=JAMES|date=June 29, 1988|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=April 7, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1988 for $61 million and [[Geffen Records]] in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-15/business/fi-389_1_geffen-records-products|title=MCA Buys Out Last Major Independent Record Label :  Entertainment: In a much anticipated deal, the giant conglomerate will get Geffen Records for stock worth $545 million.|last=Jr|first=JUBE SHIVER|date=March 15, 1990|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=April 7, 2017|last2=CIEPLY|first2=MICHAEL|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $550 million.

In 1982, Sheinberg was quoted saying, "You'd better start saving money to pay your attorney's fees, I view litigation as a profit center" during a meeting to get [[Nintendo]] to pay Universal to pay royalties for Nintendo's ''[[Donkey Kong franchise|Donkey Kong]]'' franchise. Later when Universal sued Nintendo, this quote was brought up in court. Nintendo was found non-infringing, and it was also revealed that Universal knew ''[[King Kong]]'' was in the public domain all along.&lt;ref&gt;http://thegaminghistorian.com/universal-vs-nintendo-case/{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also, ''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]''

His battle with [[Terry Gilliam]] over the final cut of the movie ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' was the subject of a book and documentary entitled ''The Battle of Brazil''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Matthews |first=Jack |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QhTu2cmUcqUC&amp;dq=battle+of+brazil&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=The Battle of Brazil |year=1987 |ISBN=0-517-56538-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Sheinberg and [[Lew Wasserman]] negotiated a $6.59 billion sale of MCA and Universal to Japan's [[Matsushita Electric]] in cash and securities.

Sheinberg departed Universal in July 1995, following the takeover of the studio by the [[Seagram]] Company.&lt;ref name="reporterbernardweinraub"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinraub|first1=Bernard|title=For MCA and Hollywood, a Generational Shift|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/12/business/for-mca-and-hollywood-a-generational-shift.html|accessdate=October 30, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=July 12, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced several feature films through his production company [[The Bubble Factory]] over the decade that followed.

==Boards and Honors==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2011}}

He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of [[Pitzer College]] (one of the [[Claremont Colleges|Claremont]] group of colleges), the Board of The American Jewish Committee, the Board of Research To Prevent Blindness and the Board of Trustees of the [[Simon Wiesenthal]] Center, is Vice Chairman of [[Human Rights Watch]]&lt;ref name = "Media Decoder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/it-came-out-of-the-viral-media-swamp/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|first=Michael|last=Cieply|title=It Came Out of the Viral Media Swamp|work=Media Decoder|publisher= The NY Times|date=April 10, 2011|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is co-founder of the Children's Action Network.

'''''Space Mutiny''''' (also known as '''''Mutiny in Space''''') is a 1988 South African [[space opera]] [[action film]] about a [[mutiny]] aboard the [[generation ship]] known as the ''Southern Sun''. The film has since developed a cult following after being featured in a popular episode of the television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

== Plot ==
The ''Southern Sun'' is a [[generation ship]], or a spacefaring vessel that contains a large number of people, whose mission is to colonize a new world. Its voyage from its original homeworld (implied to be [[Earth]]) has lasted thirteen generations, so many of its inhabitants have been born and will die without ever setting foot on solid ground. This does not please the antagonist, Elijah Kalgan ([[John Phillip Law]]), who conspires with the pirates infesting the nearby [[Corona Borealis]] system and the ship’s Chief Engineer MacPhearson ([[James Ryan (actor)|James Ryan]]). Kalgan hatches a plot to disrupt the Southern Sun’s navigation systems and use the Enforcers, the ship’s [[police]] force, to [[Aircraft hijacking|hijack]] the ship and direct it towards this system. At this point, the inhabitants of the ''Southern Sun'' will have no choice but to accept his "generosity".

Kalgan sabotages a key part of the ship just as an important professor's shuttle is on a landing trajectory. The loss of guidance control causes the ship to explode. The shuttle's pilot, Dave Ryder ([[Reb Brown]]), is able to escape, but the professor dies in the explosion. This sabotage seals off the flight deck for a number of weeks, which gives Kalgan the opportunity to attempt to wrest control. With the Enforcers in his hand, and with the flight deck out of commission, he holds the entire population of the ''Southern Sun'' hostage. Commander Jansen ([[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]]) and Captain Devers enlist Ryder’s assistance, aided begrudgingly by Jansen’s daughter Dr. Lea Jansen ([[Cisse Cameron]]), to regain control of the ship.

==Cast==
* [[Reb Brown]] as Dave Ryder
* [[John Phillip Law]] as Flight Commander Elijah Kalgan
* [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] as Commander Alex Jansen
* [[Cisse Cameron]] as Dr. Lea Jansen
* [[James Ryan (actor)|James Ryan]] as Chief Engineer MacPhearson
* Graham Clark as Captain Scott Devers
* Billy Second as Lieutenant Lemont
* Gary D. Sweeney as Ranger

== Production ==
''Space Mutiny'' stars [[Reb Brown]], [[Cisse Cameron]], [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] and [[John Phillip Law]]. The spaceship effects were lifted wholly from the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' TV series.&lt;ref name="imdb-trivia"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The director of ''Space Mutiny'' has stated on his website that he was called away from set due to a death in the family before filming began, and delegated directing duties to the assistant director. Contractually he was apparently unable to get an [[Alan Smithee]] credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some commentators began to compile rather large lists of continuity errors.
The engineering areas of the ship were filmed in an industrial building with un-futuristic brick walls, windows and concrete floors, while the bridge looks remarkably like a vintage-1980s corporate office (non-shag, neutral carpeting; white particleboard desks; computers with 16-color [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] displays, including one with a 5¼ inch [[floppy disk]] drive as an [[identity document|ID card]] reader). Kalgan’s "torture chamber" set features contemporary computer keyboards inexplicably mounted on the walls. The characters tend to wear the silver or white [[lamé (fabric)|lamé]] outfits that were common to science fiction/futurist productions of the time, while many of the female characters wear [[spandex]] [[leotard]]s.

The film's notable flaws provided substantial material for later spoofing on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', and Eccentric Cinema described it as "quite possibly the worst science fiction/space adventure film made in English".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
One chase scene involves slow-moving Enforcer vehicles, strongly resembling bowling-alley floor polishers, and the collision of two of these vehicles produces an extraordinary explosion for such small craft. The scene is further undermined by the intense sunlight streaming into the corridor.

John Phillip Law, who appeared in this movie as the villain Elijah Kalgan, also starred in the 1968 Italian film ''[[Danger: Diabolik|Diabolik]]'' (coincidentally, ''Diabolik'' was also featured as the series finale on ''Mystery Science Theater 3000''). [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] played Commander Jansen, along with his daughter Camille Mitchell, who provided the voice for Jennara, the lead Bellarian; and his son Chip Mitchell played Blake, a mustachioed member of Kalgan’s crew.

The song that plays over the end credits, "Edge of a Dream", is performed by [[Steven McClintock]].

== ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' ==
Nine years after its initial release, ''Space Mutiny'' was lampooned in a November 1997 episode of movie-mocking television comedy series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' (MST3K). The movie’s editing flaws, stilted dialog, and poor production lent itself well to the ''MST3K'' treatment, and it has repeatedly proved to be one of the most popular episodes, released as part of the ''MST3K DVD Collection, Vol. 4'' from [[Rhino Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="sn-dvds"&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also chosen by fans to appear in the MST3K 2016 Turkey Day Marathon.

Many of the scenes involving characters being thrown to their deaths over guardrails in the interior were coined as "railing kills" by Mike and the Bots, and inspired Tom Servo to install railings all over the Satellite of Love. Mike and the Bots also mock the fact that a character killed on screen shows up prominently as an extra in later scenes. Throughout the film, the appearances of the characters were sources of ridicule: Dave Ryder, the muscular protagonist, is referred to by many ridiculous names, including, but not limited to, "Slab Bulkhead", "Bolt Vanderhuge", "Hack Blowfist", "Fridge Largemeat", "Big McLarge Huge", "Buff Drinklots", "Stomp Beefknob", and "Punt Speedchunk".  Ryder is also compared to Swedish actor [[Dolph Lundgren]].  Ryder's love interest, Lea Jansen, who in the movie appears to be much older than him despite being six years younger, is referred to as Lea's father (Commander Jansen)'s "grandmadaughter"; Commander Jansen is compared to Santa Claus and to God, due to his white hair and beard, while Captain Devers is compared to [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and Kalgan is noted for his resemblance to [[Pat Riley]]. Kalgan receives additional mockery for the similarity of his name to the [[Calgon]] home maintenance brand.

Some ten minutes of footage were cut from ''Space Mutiny'' for its use on ''MST3K''. Much of the edited footage featured space battle scenes taken from the original television series of ''Battlestar Galactica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= An Analytical Guide to Television's Battlestar Galactica: An Episode Guide and Analysis of the 1978 Science Fiction Television Series and Its Short Lived Sequel, "Galactica: 1980"|first= John Kenneth |last= Muir|publisher= McFarland|isbn= 0-7864-0441-8|pages= 146|chapter= In 1997, Mike, Crow and Servo watched Space Mutiny|year= 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The version of the film featured in the episode was, in essence, consistent with the full version; the discontinuities apparent in the episode were all present in the 1988 film.  [[Mike Nelson (character)|Mike Nelson]] and the robots did not comment on the reused ''Battlestar Galactica'' footage. Series writer Paul Chaplin acknowledged this omission, but did not provide an explanation.&lt;ref name="aceg"&gt;{{cite web

On June 14, 2018, The film was treated to an all-new riffing by Nelson, Corbett and Murphy in one of their "[[Rifftrax]] - Live!" shows, broadcast to theatres via satellite, this time for the entire film.  A rebroadcast was presented on June 19th.

[[File:Edward VII .jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]] is regarded as a "sporting man"]]
The '''sporting man culture''' involves men leading hedonistic lifestyles that included keeping mistresses as well excessive eating, drinking, smoking, gambling, and [[big game hunting]]. It is applied to a large group of middle- and upper-class men in the mid-19th century, most often in [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]]. The definition has little to do with actually playing sports.  [[Edward VII]] and his companion [[Joseph Aylesford|"Sporting Joe" Aylesford]] are regarded{{according to whom|date=November 2013}} as practitioners of the sporting man culture.

'''''Star Wreck''''' is a series of [[Finland|Finnish]] ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[parody]] movies started by [[Samuli Torssonen]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1994659/ |title=Samuli Torssonen |publisher=Internet Movie Database  |accessdate=2009-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first movie, simply named ''Star Wreck'', was a simple ''[[Star Control]]''-like animation with three ships shooting at each other, but later movies featured 3D [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], animated characters and, in the latest films, live actors. Often ''Star Wreck'' is used to refer to the latest and most popular film ''[[Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning]]''.

''Star Wreck'' relates the adventures of James B. Pirk (named after the ''Star Trek'' character [[James T. Kirk]]), Captain of the starship C.P.P. ''Potkustartti'' (English C.P.P. ''Kickstart''). Other characters include Mr. Fukov, Mr. Spook ''(Finnish: Mr. Spökö)'', Mr. Dwarf ''(Wuf)'', Ensign Shitty and Mr. Info (loosely based, respectively, on Star Trek's [[Pavel Chekov]], [[Mr. Spock]], [[Worf]], [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]], and [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]]). The characters speak [[Finnish language|Finnish]], but [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] in  various languages, including Klingon, are available.

==Films==
All ''Star Wreck'' films are available for free download and viewing online.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They are offered under a [[Creative Commons]] [[CC BY-NC-ND]] [[Creative Commons license|licence]].

* ''[[Star Wreck II: The Old Shit]]'' (1994)
* ''[[Star Wreck III: The Wrath of the Romuclans]]'' (1995)
* ''[[Star Wreck IV: The Kilpailu]]'' (1996)

* ''[[Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning]]'' (2005)
* ''[[Star Wreck 2π: Full Twist, now!]]'' (2012)

The first five ''Star Wreck'' films were re-released on ''[[Star Wreck: Legacy]]'' DVD in 2006, with original score replacing the ''Star Trek'' score, and other changes. ''Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning'' was re-released on an ''Imperial Edition'' DVD in 2006, with updated models and effects.

==Popularity==
''Star Wreck'' has enjoyed a relatively large niche following among sci-fi fans, but it was only the 2005 movie that really pushed it into the limelight. ''[[Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning]]'' was downloaded over 700,000 times during the first week after its release &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/star-trek-spoof-gaining-internet-fame/d/d-id/1036707?print=yes 'Star Trek' Spoof Gaining Internet Fame] on informationweek.com (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and the current estimates by the hosting service, Magenta sites, are between 3.5 and 4 million downloads, including mirror sites. This has been claimed to make ''In the Pirkinning'' the most popular Finnish film of all time, topping the movie theatre viewings for ''[[The Unknown Soldier (1955 film)|The Unknown Soldier]]'' (approx. 2.8 million viewers); the comparison, however, may not be particularly meaningful. Numerous TV and magazine interviews of the film's authors have been published, both in Finland and abroad.

''Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning'' has also been shown on Finnish national television, [[YLE TV2]], on the Belgian national television channel Canvas, and Italian TV-channel Jimmy.

A new Imperial Edition DVD has also been released by [[Universal Pictures]] in Scandinavia. With the Imperial Edition release, all the space scenes with ''Star Trek'' or ''Babylon 5'' ship models were removed and completely remade.

In September 2007, a 1-DVD version of ''Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning – Imperial Edition'' was released also in Japan by AMG &amp; Medallion Media. The version includes a professional dub for Japanese, as well as new sleeve design and a poster/cue card inside the DVD case.

In 2012, a spin-off called ''Star Wreck 2π: Full Twist, now!'' was released. It is made by Swiss film makers, but Samuli Torssonen and Timo Vuorensola have a guest appearance in their respective roles.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Wreck 2π'' on [[IMBD]]: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2367670/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a spin-off animated ''Star Wreck'', created by a different author who has no relation to Torssonen's team, called ''[[Star Wreck Asskicker]]'' which tells the story of the ''[[C.P.P. Asskicker]]''.

'''''Stella''''' ({{lang-el|Στέλλα}}) is a 1955 Greek film is a retelling of ''[[Carmen]]'' featuring [[Melina Mercouri]]. The film was directed by the [[Greek Cypriot]] [[Michael Cacoyannis]] and written by Cacoyannis and [[Iakovos Kambanelis]].  The music was composed by [[Manos Hadjidakis]] and [[Vassilis Tsitsanis]].

''Stella'' was originally intended to be a stage play with the title ''Stella with the Red Gloves'', but it was never staged. It has been claimed that this story was the perfect vehicle for the thirty-five-year-old Mercouri's film debut. Indeed, it was the hit that Melina Mercouri needed. The film sparked great controversy, and although it was initially rejected by Greek critics, it is now considered{{by whom|date=September 2015}} one of the five greatest Greek films.

At the [[1955 Cannes Film Festival]], where the film was screened,&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3733/year/1955.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Stella |accessdate=2009-02-01|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melina met [[Jules Dassin]], her future husband, [[mentor]], and [[film director|director]]. He helped her to secure major roles in such films as ''[[Topkapi (film)|Topkapi]]'', ''[[Never on Sunday]]'', ''[[Phaedra (film)|Phaedra]]'', and ''[[10:30 P.M. Summer]]'', which have become major international successes.

==Plot==
The story of a fiercely independent and uncompromising young woman. Stella, a [[rembetiko]] singer at Paradise nightclub, lives a guiltless, turbulent life. Her innate independence and assertive nature lead her to numerous passionate love affairs. While with Aleko, son of a wealthy family, she decides, as is her habit, to break up before the relationship wears off. Once she meets Miltos, a young [[soccer]] player, she seems to change. At first, she avoids his advances, but, later, gives in to him. However, she can only be with him on her own terms. No matter how much she loves him, she mostly values her freedom. Things turn complicated when she is called to choose. She repeatedly rejects Miltos marriage proposals. When Miltos finally forces her to accept the idea of marriage, Stella does not appear in church, despite Miltos repeatedly warning her that he will kill her if she doesn't marry him.  Miltos kills her with a dagger at end of the film.

It has been said that the story of Stella's forced marriage symbolises the forces that are constantly trying to impose their will on Greece.

== Plot ==
The series revolves around Mike Fukanaga and his friends, Owen and Amanda. After the death of his grandfather, Mike is given a mysterious letter which leads him to discover that he comes from a long line of vigilante ninjas. With Owen, and later Amanda, they are ushered into the world of crime-fighting, forming the team "Supah Ninjas." They are trained with a hologram of Mike's grandfather, whom Owen refers to as "Hologramps" in Empire City.

== Cast ==

=== Main cast ===
*[[Ryan Potter (actor)|Ryan Potter]] as Mike Fukanaga. He is [[Japanese American|Japanese-American]]. Mike is quiet, shy, socially-awkward and a little nerdy (in the pilot, it is said that he is part of a Star Wars fan club). He and his rowdy friend Owen discover a secret underground dojo under his bed, where a hologram of his late grandfather awaits to train him in the ways of the ninja. Mike discovers he is the latest in a long family line of ninjas (besides his slightly inept father), and ultimately learns about leadership, friendship, discipline, deception, and romance while saving Empire City from villains. As said by Hologramps, his reflexes make him incredibly versatile and adaptive. His weapon of choice is a pair of [[nunchucks]] and his necklace (or Mon in Japanese) is a disguised shuriken. Mike's friend/co-ninja Amanda is his love interest. In the finale, "The Floating Sword", Mike uses the force palm ability, similar to Kagema Fukanaga's. In the end, the ninjas get the floating sword back with the help of Mike's cousin, Connor. The episode (and the series) ends with Kagema stunning and kidnapping Mike at his school and then escaping through a window.
*[[Carlos Knight]] as Owen Reynolds. Mike's best friend and fellow-Supah Ninja. He is of [[African American]] descent. Owen is a bit eccentric, he has a tendency to overreact, tends to show little discipline, he has smart mouth, but his instincts make him a powerful and fearless warrior nonetheless. Owen loves food and often eats or thinks about eating while the team has big problems to deal with. Owen is known to be lazy at times. He is the only character to call Grandpa Fukunaga "Hologramps". As said by Hologramps, his instincts make him fearless. His signature weapon is a [[Bō]] staff. He's always trying to impress girls, especially Kelly and later Paloma Peru, sometimes using Amanda or Mike as a "wing-man" of sorts.
*[[Gracie Dzienny]] as Amanda McKay. She is a smart, stylish, socially apt, pretty, talented, and popular cheerleader, ninja, and scholar which, as proclaimed by Mike in the first episode makes her "like a self contained high school" but better looking. In episode one she is [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] by The Rhymer and though the ninjas (Mike and Owen) are still in basic training they perform an equally daring and erratic rescue based on her using hand signals Mike translated her using to signal where she had been taken. When she discovers who her rescuers are (because they make it easy by calling each other by name and Amanda recognizes Mike's Mon), she pressures them into letting her in on the action by threatening to tell everyone about the "Supah Ninjas" (coined by Owen) ultimately leading to her inclusion in the group. Her family is wealthy as they own the chain of McKay Casinos (this is why she is kidnapped). Later in the series she seems to develop romantic feelings for Mike that become glaringly obvious in the last handful of episodes. As said by Hologramps, she is distinctive from the rest of the group due to her methodical nature. Her choice weapons are a pair of [[tonfa]].
*[[imdbname:3695951|Travis Wong]] and [[imdbname:3357793|Jake Huang]] alternate as actors within the Yamato suit and [[imdbname:0455058|Matthew Yang King]] (as Matt Yang King) voices Yamato, the X-39-P Fighting Robot trainer. The Ninjas sometimes call him Yama as a nickname. He helps the ninjas become better as a practice opponent at the dojo. Yamato usually defeats the ninjas intheir sparring matches. He is sarcastic and wise-cracking almost all of the time. He was severely damaged by the fighting robot Kagema Fukanaga created, Hakaisha (meaning the one who destroys or destroyer) in "The Ishina Strike Back". He was later repaired by Kid Q in "Enter the Dojo" and tells the ninjas that the floating sword was never in the dojo. Yamato and Quentin have begun to have a close friendship.
*[[George Takei]] as Hattori "Hologramps" Fukanaga. The sensei of the Supah Ninjas and Mike's deceased grandfather. A hologram carrying the family ninja legacy, he guides and the Supah Ninjas in an underground high-tech dojo under The Fukanaga home and uses Yamato (mentioned above) guide them in combat as well as using other tactics (like meditation) to round out their skill sets. At the end of "Subsiders" he is seen watching the ninjas play in Mike's room and talking to Yamato where it becomes apparent he is hiding something huge from the ninjas. It is unknown whether the secret he's hiding is about the Ishina or the Floating Sword. Grandpa was later disabled by his twin brother Kagema Fukanaga in "The Ishina Strike Back". Grandfather is finally brought back by Quentin/Kid Q in "The Floating Sword" and tells the Supah Ninjas it is time to start the next phase of their training with the sword.

=== Recurring cast ===
*[[Randall Park]] as Martin Fukanaga, Mike's single father (his mother died of some unknown cause) and police officer. Unlike Hologramps and Mike, the "ninja trait" skipped his generation. In the episode "Katara", Martin dates Katara, a knife-wielding cat burglar pursued by the Supah Ninjas. He is very gullible and somewhat clueless but always has the best of intentions at heart for his son. He appeared in all episodes except "Kickbutt", "The Magnificent", "Detention" (mentioned), "The Con Man", "Flint Forster", "Shadow Fly", "Kid Q", "Cheer Fever", and "Finding Forster". He sees the ninjas as heroes when others in law enforcement do not seem to.
*Jordan Nichols as Cameron Vanhauser, the son of the owner of Empire Condominiums. He's been in the episodes "Komodo", "The Magnificent", "Morningstar Academy", "Detention" and was mentioned in "Dollhouse". Amanda broke up with him after he told her he felt she was too boring and straight-laced. In "Detention" he had let himself go (not exercising, not bathing, etc.). In the end of the episode, Amanda tells him that he will meet the perfect girl, but she's not the one.
*[[Giselle Bonilla]] as Kelly, Amanda's friend and fellow cheerleader. Despite her blatant dislike of Owen and Mike she rains the object of Owen's unwarranted flirting and advances. However, it is revealed in "Detention" that she has a soft and considerate side. Kelly has not appeared in the second season leaving her whereabouts unknown.
*[[Victory Van Tuyl]] as Julie, a kind, smart, and attractive girl who shares a lot in common with Mike, such as a love of comic books. She became Mike's love interest and girlfriend. She has a definite affection for Mike, as revealed in "Frostbite" where she kisses him on the lips after their first real date. In "Flint Forster", she breaks up with Mike through a text because she had moved away 2 weeks prior. She appears in "Dollhouse", "X", "Quake", "Frostbite" and "Cousin Connor".
*Marissa Cuevas as Paloma Peru, a school reporter who is introduced in "Shadow Fly". Owen seems to have a crush on her. She is actively pursuing the ninjas.
*[[Matthew Gumley]] as Quentin, a science nerd, and Owen's friend. Owen's christens him "Kid Q". In "Enter the Dojo" he is given the knowledge of the ninjas secret identity and swears to secrecy. He is the one to help fix the dojo, repair Yamato and help re-enable Hologramps at the dojo.

===Main villains===
Any villain who made a second appearance, escaped/were not arrested, or vowed revenge include:

*Ishina: A rival ninja clan who were against the Fukunaga clan and are after a weapon known as the Floating Sword. They "kidnapped" Connor but it was later revealed to be a set-up, revealing Connor as their leader, serving a more powerful master: Grandpa Fukanaga's evil twin brother Kagema. He finds out Mike, Owen, and Amanda are ninjas in "Quake". They appear again in "Cousin Connnor" where Connor tries to get the ninjas to turn on themselves but Mike finds out that Connor is one of the Ishina and that they all have been tricked by him. This eventually leads to a battle between him and Connor but Kagema takes all the ninjas out and he and Connor escape. Connor manages to get hold of Mike's medallion and uses it to get into the dojo where he intends to relieve Mike of the Floating Sword.
*[[Brandon Soo Hoo]] as Mike's cousin Connor, the grandson of Mike's grandfather's sister (great-aunt). He's seen in the episodes "Mr. Bradford", "Jellyface", "DJ Elephant Head", "Ishina", "Quake", "Cousin Connor" and "The Con Man". He loves to work with technology (filming Conn'd) and gaming (looking at a game controller at the beginning of "Cousin Connor"). He is also the scheming co-leader of the Ishina (the rival clan of the Fukanaga's). Their goal is to steal the "Floating Sword" back from the Fukanaga family to create a powerful weapon to attempt world domination (or at least enacting revenge on the members of the Fukanaga family). At the end of the first season, and then end of the episode "Cousin Connor," he stole Mike's [[Mon (emblem)|mon]], which he used to open the secret entrance to the dojo. After his infiltration attempt is thwarted, he tricks the ninjas into thinking that the Ishina were holding his parents hostage to try and take out the trio but is foiled again. After the fight he was sent to [[Madagascar]] in a shipping crate.
*Kagema Fukanaga: Hologramps' evil twin brother and Mike's great uncle. He was entrusted to protect the Floating Sword but betrayed his family attempting to steal it but was thwarted by his brother. He currently is the leader of the Ishina clan. He manages to take out the ninjas and escapes with Connor. In "Grounded Ninja" it's been revealed why he needs the floating sword, to complete his ultimate weapon, a robotic ninja named "Hakaisha - The One Who Destroys". In the episode "The Floating Sword", he was defeated by Mike and Connor, but at the end of the episode Kagema takes Mike at his school and escapes through the window. He is portrayed by George Takei.
*The Rhymer: A villain who rhymes when speaking, he was pursued by the Supah Ninjas in the pilot episode. All the places he robbed rhymed with each other. His minions were defeated by Mike and Owen and were arrested, but the Rhymer himself managed to escape, storming off in a fit of rage after saying, "Nothing rhymes with 'oranges!'" He is portrayed by [[Christopher Reid (entertainer)|Christopher Reid]].
*Katara: &lt;!-- iTunes says Katara Sharp --&gt; Katherine Sharp was a knife-throwing cat burglar who stole priceless antiquities. She started dating Mike's father in order to break into a museum he was guarding. She managed to escape before the ninjas could capture her. She is portrayed by [[Sydney Tamiia Poitier]].
*Two-Ton Harley: Harland Mauzer is an overweight biker who ate a lot of food to gain weight and reunite with his old gang, the Wrecking Crew. He was taken out by the Ninjas and was recaptured at the end of the episode. He was the first villain that was actually captured by the ninjas. He returns in "Enter the Dojo" when Quentin releases him from prison thinking the ninjas want to face off against their biggest enemy. He breaks into the Food Rodeo and tells the ninjas that when he's finished with his food he'll reunite his crew and break down the city. He was defeated by the ninjas yet again, with the aid of Mike's dad, Martin. He is portrayed by WWE wrestler The [[Big Show]].
*Checkmate: An "undefeated" chess prodigy, Nicholias Spaski who cheats and uses elaborate traps to gain the advantage and win. He returns in "Eternum" where he was being held captive, where he quoted, "My queen has returned," hinting that he is Amanda's archenemy. He revealed he told Eternum about her, Mike, and Owen. He tells her how to shut the power which will release all the inmates, including him, but will also save Mike. This leads to Checkmate's escape, leaving "Game On, Ninjas!" written on his cell window, hinting a return. He is portrayed by [[Rick D. Wasserman]].
*Red-Eye: A former biology teacher at Benjamin Rush High School, Benjamin Arneson/Bradford became a bug-like monster (nicknamed "Red-Eye" by owen) when he experimented on himself to try to find a universal cure for disease. He used his newly acquired abilities to break into his old workplace to get the necessary items to create a cure. He managed to find the formula, but he used it to cure Amanda's own infection. He still at large and is still trying to find a way to cure himself, as seen at the end of the episode. He is portrayed by [[Scott Lowell]] and seems to be based on [[Dr. Curtis Connors]]/the Lizard from the [[Spider-Man]] franchise.
*Jellyface: Frankie Fellows used Plasma 17 to disguise himself as the people who got him arrested and have them suffer as much as he did. He was taken down by Mike. He returns in "Detention" where he kidnapped Mike at the beginning, posed as him, and smashed the trophy case so he can get into the school on Saturday, where Martin was going to be during Homecoming, and plant a bomb and a tank of poison gas in order to get revenge on both Mike and Martin. His plan was foiled when Owen took him out during a battle with Mike and Amanda defusing the bomb. He apparently knows the ninjas identities.
*Malleni the Magnificent: A skilled magician who faked his own kidnapping to frame both his assistant Veronica, and his rival, Dominic the Magnificent. He was stopped when he was kicked into a magic box by Owen. When it split into 3 pieces, so did he, vowing vengeance on the Supah Ninjas. He is portrayed by [[Vince Corazza]].

Amanda helped him take off his gloves and gave him a music box. He then leaves peacefully. He is portrayed by Esteban Cueto.

'''''The Great Gabbo''''' (1929) is an American [[Pre-Code]] early [[sound film|sound]] musical drama film directed by [[James Cruze]], based on a story ("The Rival Dummy") by [[Ben Hecht]] and starring [[Erich von Stroheim]] and [[Betty Compson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=9486 The AFI Catalog of Feature Films: ''The Great Gabbo'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As originally released by [[Sono Art-World Wide Pictures]], the film featured sequences in [[Multicolor]]. The current prints, restored by the [[Library of Congress]] and released by [[Kino International (company)|Kino International]] on DVD, now exist only in black and white.

Footage from the film was used on ''[[Fractured Flickers]]'' in the segment "Hymie und Me" (Episode 14), in which the dummy is presented as a real living comedian with von Stroheim as his straight man.

==Plot==
The movie follows brilliant [[ventriloquist]] "The Great Gabbo" (Stroheim), who increasingly uses his dummy "Otto" as his only means of self-expression—an artist driven insane by his work.

Gabbo's gimmick is his astonishing ability to make Otto talk—and even sing—while Gabbo himself smokes, drinks and eats. Gabbo's girlfriend and assistant Mary (Betty Compson) loves him, but is driven to leave him by his megalomania, superstitions, irritability, and inability to express any human emotion without using Otto as an intermediary. In Otto's voice Gabbo accepts the blame for Mary's leaving and recounts all the things she did for him, but as Gabbo he denies his feelings and tells the dummy to shut up.

Two years later, Gabbo has become a nationally renowned ventriloquist. He is revered for his talent even as he is ridiculed for his eccentricity: he takes Otto with him everywhere he goes, even dining out with him, providing much entertainment to the restaurant patrons. Despite his success he continues to pine for Mary, who is now romantically involved with another singer/dancer, Frank (Donald Douglas). With both Mary and Frank performing in a show in which Gabbo is the headliner, he attempts to win her back. Mary is charmed by Gabbo's new romantic behavior, driving Frank to angry fits of jealousy. As his courtship meets with continued success, Gabbo increasingly expresses his emotions to Mary directly, without using Otto.

One day Gabbo finds that in his absence, Mary has straightened up his dressing room the way she always used to. Convinced that she wants to come back to him, he confronts her with his feelings, admitting his loneliness without her and in the process revealing that he has grown past many of his old failings, such as his superstitions and obsession with his personal success. However, Mary tells him that she loves Frank, and has been married to him since before Gabbo came back into her life. She says that she missed Otto but not Gabbo, and in a last farewell she says "I love you" to Otto.

In profound frustration at this, after Mary is gone Gabbo punches Otto in the face, but immediately apologizes and embraces the dummy, weeping. He then storms onto the stage during the finale and loudly rants at the performers. He is forced off the stage and fired from the show. Mary tries to confront Gabbo afterwards, but he only looks at her sadly and walks away. The film ends with workers taking down the letters of "The Great Gabbo" from the [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]] as Gabbo looks on.

==Cast==
*[[Erich von Stroheim]] as The Great Gabbo
*[[Betty Compson]] as Mary
*[[Don Douglas|Donald Douglas]] as Frank
*[[Marjorie Kane]] as Babe
*George Grandee as Otto (voice) (uncredited)
*[[John F. Hamilton]] as Neighbour (uncredited)
*Harry Ross as Performer (uncredited)
*Marbeth Wright as Dancer (uncredited)

==Production==
Touted in advertising as an "all-dialog singing, dancing and dramatic spectacle", this early [[sound film]] oddly interleaves stark drama with gratuitous full-length, large-scale, on-stage musical [[Number (music)|production numbers]] such as "Every Now and Then", "I'm in Love with You", "The New Step", "The Web of Love", and the now-missing "The Ga Ga Bird", which was filmed in color. The "Web of Love" number, in which the performers wear stylized spider and fly costumes, is occasionally shown on [[Classic Arts Showcase]]. Footage from the dance sequences was re-used with different music in ''[[The Girl from Calgary]]'' (1932).

The [[public domain]] version available on [[Internet Archive]] runs 68 minutes, while the original film ran 96 minutes, including the exit music. The [[opening credits]] mention "Color sequences by Multicolor", but those sequences are now either [[lost film|lost]] or have survived only in [[black-and-white]] form. Multicolor, based on the earlier [[Prizma]] color process, went out of business in 1932; its assets were bought by [[Cinecolor]].

The quality and clarity of the film sound is notable.

A 94 minute public domain version is now available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Great Gabbo |url=http://www.publicdomaintorrents.info/nshowmovie.html?movieid=215 |website=Public Domain Torrents |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
''The Great Gabbo'' opened to lukewarm reviews. Stroheim received good notices, but the film did nothing to further his career.&lt;ref&gt;Lennig, Arthur. ''Stroheim'' ([[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]]: [[University Press of Kentucky]]) p 295. {{ISBN|0-8131-2138-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Photoplay]]'' called the film "a bitter disappointment... Cruze seems to have lost his sense of humor, and the lighting and scenario are terrible."&lt;ref&gt;Kreuger, Miles ed. ''The Movie Musical from Vitaphone to 42nd Street as Reported in a Great Fan Magazine'' (New York: [[Dover Publications]]) p 111. {{ISBN|0-486-23154-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' review commented unfavorably on the technical quality of the color sequences.&lt;!-- Sorry, proper cit data not at hand, source is the NYT film reviews book set --&gt; Historian [[Arthur Lennig]] wrote that ''The Great Gabbo'' "betrays little inventiveness and shows few of its actors to advantage." He notes that, due to obvious budget constraints, several line-flubs by cast members made it into the final cut.&lt;ref&gt;Lennig, p 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

It opened on  January 12, 1921, and seats approximately 1,500 people.

In the 1930s, the first public-affairs media programming originated here with the ''[[America's Town Meeting of the Air]]'' radio programs. In recognition of this the [[National Park Service]] placed the building on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2012,&lt;ref name="NHL designation announcement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Weekly list of actions taken on properties 3/12/12 through 3/16/12|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20120323.htm|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|date=March 23, 2012|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designated it a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/29/new-york-town-hall-spotlight-celebration_n_2981191.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Curtis | last=Wong | title=Broadway, 'Smash' Stars Hit NYC's Town Hall For Historic Celebration | date=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Town Hall was built by the [[League for Political Education]], whose fight for passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (women's suffrage) led them to commission the building of a meeting space where people of every rank and station could be educated on the important issues of the day. The space, which became The Town Hall, was designed by the renowned architectural firm of [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]], to reflect the democratic principles of the League. To this end, box seats were not included in the theater's design, and every effort was made to ensure that there were no seats with an obstructed view. This design principle gave birth to The Town Hall's long-standing mantra: "Not a bad seat in the house."

It has not only become a meeting place for educational programs, gatherings of activists, and host for controversial speakers (such as the American advocate of [[birth control]], [[Margaret Sanger]], who was arrested and carried off The Town Hall stage on November 13, 1921, for attempting to speak to a mixed-sex audience about [[contraception]]), but as one of New York City's premiere performance spaces for music, dance, and other performing arts. While the lecture series and courses on political and non-political subjects sponsored by the League continued to be held there, The Town Hall quickly established a reputation as an arts center during the first fifteen years of its existence.

It has also had a long association with the promotion of poetry in the United States, which predates [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]]'s public poetry reading debut at the Hall in 1928.  The Hall has retained a close association with poets and poetry that continues to this day.

=== ''America's Town Meeting of the Air'' ===
''[[America's Town Meeting of the Air]]'' was a radio program produced at the Hall for over twenty years, from 1935 to 1956. ''Town Meeting'' was the brain-child of [[George V. Denny, Jr.]], then the associate director of the Hall.  Envisioned as a means of expanding the audience &amp;mdash; first nationally, then internationally &amp;mdash; for the programs held at the Hall which promoted the free exchange of ideas, the format of ''Town Meeting'' was a conversation among four speakers on a predetermined question. The series was launched on the [[NBC Blue Network]] on [[Memorial Day]] 1935. Although it began broadcasting on a single station with approximately 500,000 listeners, within three years, ''Town Meeting'' was carried by 78 stations and boasted 2.5 million listeners.  ''Town Meeting'' also toured the United States and twelve cities on three continents. It won numerous awards.

Recordings of ''America's Town Meeting of the Air'', from 1935 to 1952, are preserved at the United States' [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]' Donated Historical Materials collection, the catalog number of which is "DM.13".

The organizational records (archives) of Town Hall, Inc. and ''America's Town Meeting of the Air'', 1895–1955, are held by the Manuscripts and Archives Division of [[The New York Public Library]].

The Town Hall was owned by [[New York University]] for twenty years beginning in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TROUQlCmP8kC&amp;pg=PA88 |title=Landmarks Preservation &amp; the Property Tax |first=David |last=Listokin |page=88 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2012 |accessdate=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical performances==
The outstanding acoustic properties of Town Hall for musical performance &amp;mdash; which some performers claim rival those of [[Carnegie Hall]] &amp;mdash; were discovered during the first musical event held at the venue: a recital by Spanish violinist [[Juan Manén]] on February 12, 1921. Later in 1921, German composer [[Richard Strauss]] gave a series of concerts that cemented the Hall's reputation as an ideal space for musical performances. Aside from the acoustics, the sight lines and remarkable intimacy of the auditorium has made it a popular venue for both new and experienced artists, whatever the instrument, repertoire, or style of the performer. During the 1920s and 1930s, The Town Hall quickly gained a reputation amongst performers and audiences as "the place" for a performer to make a New York debut.

In 1928, The Hall began producing regular musical concert series, and over the next few seasons, ''The Town Hall Endowment Series'' featured artists including [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], [[Lily Pons]], [[Feodor Chaliapin]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], and many more legends of the classical Western repertoire.

[[Marian Anderson]], considered one of the greatest [[contralto]]s ever born in the United States, made her New York debut at the Hall on December 30, 1935, after she had been denied an opportunity at an operatic career elsewhere due to [[discrimination]] against [[African-American]]s.

A notable world premiere in chamber music took place at the Town Hall on January 20, 1941, when the [[Kolisch Quartet]] gave the first performance of [[Béla Bartók]]'s [[String Quartet No. 6 (Bartók)|String Quartet No. 6]].&lt;ref name="NY Times review"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bartok Quartet heard in premiere|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F1FF9355F167B93C3AB178AD85F458485F9|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 21, 1941|accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eddie Condon]] led a series of nationally broadcast radio shows from New York's Town Hall during 1944–45.

Other important [[jazz]] concert appearances at The Town Hall include the June 22, 1945 concert &amp;mdash; featuring [[Dizzy Gillespie]], on trumpet; [[Charlie Parker]], on alto saxophone; [[Don Byas]], on tenor saxophone; [[Al Haig]], on piano; [[Curley Russell]], on bass, and [[Max Roach]], on drums (with [[Sid Catlett]] substituting for Roach on a few titles) &amp;mdash; which provided the public with its first mainstream exposure to the quickly evolving style of jazz that came to be popularly known as [[bebop]].  This concert illustrates how progressive The Town Hall's jazz programming has been since the venue's inception; prior to appearing in concert at the Hall, Gillespie and Parker had released only one 78-RPM release, and only Gillespie &amp;mdash; due to his high-profile associations with [[Cab Calloway]], [[Earl Hines]], and [[Billy Eckstine]] &amp;mdash; enjoyed mainstream name-recognition. (In June 2005, the [[Uptown Jazz]] label released a [[CD]] containing seven sonically restored performances transcribed from [[acetates]] made at the concert.) The Town Hall also hosted the 1947 concert that led to the re-invigoration of Louis Armstrong's career, and which led to the formation of [[Louis Armstrong#The All Stars|Louis Armstrong and His All Stars]], the small traditional jazz combo that he led for the last quarter-century of his life.

The Hall's tradition of jazz programming continues with the ''Not Just Jazz'' series of concerts, which also features poetry, film and dance. Past participants in the series include: [[Art Ensemble of Chicago|The Art Ensemble of Chicago]], the [[Lounge Lizards]], [[Cassandra Wilson]], [[Meredith Monk]], and [[Allen Ginsberg]].

On May 15, 1958, Town Hall hosted the 25th Year Retrospective Concert of the music of [[John Cage]].  This performance was recorded by Columbia Records producer [[George Avakian]], and the resulting 3-LP set was instrumental in making Cage's music known to many listeners.

Jazz composer and bandleader [[Charles Mingus]] also held two concerts here, resulting in his live albums from [[The Complete Town Hall Concert|October 1962]] and [[Town Hall Concert|April 1964]].

The Hall offers ''Morning Performances'', offered free of charge to public school students in grades 3 to 8, during the day.  It also features programming in alliance with [[Theatreworks USA]] as part of its ''Arts in Education'' program.

When on tour, the radio show ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' is often broadcast live from Town Hall in its New York appearances.

In September 2009, singer [[Whitney Houston]] chose the Town Hall for her first interview in seven years, appearing on [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s season premiere. When asked by Winfrey why she chose the Town Hall, Whitney said it holds a special place in her heart because it's where she performed for the first time at the age of 14.

==Reception==
The game has received mixed to negative reviews. It was praised for its graphics but criticised for its gameplay. It was also praised for its vocal work and further look to the universe of Thor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thor: Son of Asgard|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/thor-son-of-asgard|website=Metacritic|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most of reviews criticised the game for being repetitive. This objection is linked to a lack of upgrades that some reviewers noted. Controls were also criticised for being frustrating and combat system lacking of depth, being only about button mashing. The animation was also criticised by some critics for being poor.&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt;&lt;ref name=appleNapps&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheridan|first1=Trevor|title=Thor: Son of Asgard|url=http://applenapps.com/review/thor-son-of-asgard#.U_uCyvl_tqU|website=Apple N Apps|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40548">This is a timeline of [[cable television]] in the United Kingdom.

The first part of the timeline covers the development of cable across the country, including details of the cable-exclusive channels which launched in the 1990s as part of cable television's attempt to compete with [[BSkyB]]'s [[satellite television]].

The merger of [[NTL Incorporated|NTL]] and [[Telewest]] effectively resulted in a single national network, covering just over half the country. The second part of the timeline covers [[Virgin Media]].

* '''1928'''
** The foundations for cable television were laid in [[Swindon]] when a company called Radio Relay transmitted two audio channels on a wire that ran around the town to a relatively small number of homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Writer Russ J Graham |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/tvh/history/history.php |title=A short history of Rediffusion by Russ J Graham |publisher=Transdiffusion.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1950'''
**A cable network was launched in [[Gloucester]], to provide better television reception than was possible at the time via a roof-top aerial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aldricharchive.com/cable_systems.html |title=The Michael Aldrich Archive - Cable Systems |publisher=Aldricharchive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further such systems were built in other cities over the next three decades and by the late 1970s, 2.5 million British homes received their television service via cable.&lt;ref&gt;1982 Aldrich MJ co-author ''Cable Systems'' p18 HMSO London {{ISBN|0-11-630821-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1961'''
**A new cable network launches in [[Swindon]] to transmit television signals. As reception was poor, take-up was high and by the end of the decade around 15,000 homes were paying to receive their pictures via cable television. However, only those channels available in the area are allowed to be carried on the system.
* '''1972'''
** The UK's Minister for Posts and Telecommunications authorises five experimental community cable television channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Technology and In/equality: Questioning the Information Society |first1=Flis |last1=Henwood |first2=Nod |last2=Miller |first3=Peter |last3=Senker |first4=Sally |last4=Wyatt |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=9780203134504 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iDW94RKbHcoC |pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26729">'''Todd Joseph Miles Holden''' (also known as T.J.M. Holden and Todd Holden) is an [[United States|American]]-born [[social scientist]], [[essayist]], [[philosopher]], and [[novelist]]. He was the first [[tenured]] foreign professor at [[Tohoku University]], one of [[Asia]]’s elite universities, where he taught for 26 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tjmholden.com/tjmholden.com/TJMH_Academic/CV.html http://www.tjmholden.com/tjmholden.com/TJMH_Academic/TJMHolden_CV_9_2014.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarship has been multi- and [[transdisciplinarity|trans-disciplinary]], embracing [[globalization]], [[media studies]], [[cultural studies]], [[semiotics]], [[advertising]], [[television]], [[Japanese popular culture]], [[sociology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[political communication]], [[gender]], [[identity (social science)|identity]], and digital youth. Between 2000 and 2009 he was a contributor to the international webzine [[PopMatters]], writing a regular column on Japanese popular culture called ''ReDotPop'', and creating ''PM''’s first blog, ''Peripatetic Postcards''.  In 2011 he published a book by the same name, bearing the subtitle "the journey of life through 25 of the world's cities". Recent work has included literary treatments of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], [[dystopia]], philosophical detection, [[comedy]] and [[Caper story|caper]].

==Academic Background==
Holden received his BA in [[Social ecology (academic field)|Social Ecology]] from the [[University of California, Irvine]], and his PhD in Interdisciplinary Social Science from the [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]] at [[Syracuse University]].

At UCI, he was strongly influenced by Ralph (Ray) Catalano and worked with [[Larry Agran]], who went on to become Mayor of Irvine and, later, candidate for President of the United States. At Syracuse he was mentored by [[John A. Agnew]], who oversaw his dissertation, along with Ralph Ketcham and Thomas E. Patterson. Other important influences were [[Barry Glassner]], then-chair of the sociology department, and [http://disabilitystudies.syr.edu/who/rbogdan.aspx Robert Bogdan], whose approach to ethnography and qualitative content analysis have been apparent in Holden’s scholarship.

==Administrative career==
Upon obtaining his PhD, in 1988, Holden was recruited by Tohoku University, the third oldest of Japan’s so-called “[[National Seven Universities|Imperial Universities]]", and one of Asia's top-ranked universities. His initial post was lecturer in the Department of English in the (now-defunct) College of General Education. Thereafter, he taught in the Department of Social Structure and Change in the Graduate School of Information Sciences and was an associate professor of society and culture at the (now-defunct) School of Language and Culture. In 2001 he was appointed professor of mediated sociology in the Graduate School of International Cultural Studies (GSICS), becoming the first foreigner to secure tenure at Tohoku University since its establishment in 1907. Twice Chair of the Department of Multi-Cultural Societies, he helped build a small, but dynamic graduate program on media, culture and society. He retired in 2014 after nearly 27 years of service.
 
In 2000 Holden served on the planning committee of Tohoku University's "International Symposium on Research and Education in the 21st Century," (ISRE 2000), an assembly that led to exchange agreements with 29 universities and 114 university departments from 31 nations. In 2005 he was part of the working group that designed the so-called Internet School (ISTU), the university's first step toward establishing a distance education program.&lt;ref&gt;As detailed in [http://www.highedu.kyoto-u.ac.jp/edunet/DB/013.html the following account] from Kyoto University's Center for the Promotion of Excellence in Higher Education (in Japanese).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he was a Visiting Lecturer in Geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, teaching a course on sports globalization; in 2013, he was a Visiting Scholar at Harvard University's Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, working on "''Ukiyo''-ad", a book on Japanese advertising, cultural communication and media theory.

During his career, Holden held executive positions in various international professional associations, including two terms (8 years) as Chair of the Gender and Communication section of the International Association for Media and Communication Research (IAMCR), 4 years as Vice-President of the Asia-Pacific Sociology Association (APSA), and 4 years as Executive Committee Member of Anthropology of Japan in Japan (AJJ). He also served as webmaster and Communications Director for all three of these associations.

==Academic career==
In the main, Holden’s research has attended to the multiple, cross-cutting relationships between societal structures and processes, cultural values and practices, and media. Funded and published research has explored: [[cell phone]]s, the [[Internet]], television, advertising, [[novels]], children’s [[picture books]], and [[film]]. The work has generally, but not exclusively, centered on Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Early work, in particular, explored American political philosophy and political history, as well as American media such as novels and television advertisements. Some work, including a study in [http://mcs.sagepub.com/search/results?fulltext=Todd+Holden&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;submit=yes&amp;journal_set=spmcs&amp;src=selected&amp;andorexactfulltext=and Media, Culture &amp; Society] has also looked at Malaysian advertising, both in isolation and comparative context. And, both his ''medi@sia'' book and the earlier [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1876843888 ''Globalization, Culture and Inequality in Asia''] treat multiple countries and contexts in the Asian region.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting his familiarity with various communication platforms, his scholarship has appeared in the ''Sage Handbook of Media Studies '' (a global survey of advertising), ''The Encyclopedia of Television'' (a historical overview of Japanese TV), the first book ever on ''Japanese Cybercultures'' (a chapter on Internet dating), and ''Global Youth'' (a study of adolescent cell phone use in Japan). His Internet dating study, co-authored with Takako Tsuruki,&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in Nanette Gottlieb and Mark McLelland (eds.), ''Japanese Cybercultures''. London: Routledge (2003), pp.34-49; Subsequently reprinted in David Bell and Barbara M. Kennedy (eds.), ''The Cybercultures Reader'' (2nd Ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; has been extensively cited,&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Manuel Castells, Mireia Fernandez-Ardevol, Jock Linchuan Qiu, and Araba Sey, “[http://arnic.info/workshop04/MCS.pdf The Mobile Communication Society] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026010858/http://arnic.info/workshop04/MCS.pdf |date=2005-10-26 }}: A cross-cultural analysis of available evidence on the social uses of wireless communication technology,”; see also: Joel Matthews, “[http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/discussionpapers/2008/Matthews.html Suicide and the Japanese Media]: On the hunt for blame,” ''electronic journal of contemporary Japanese studies'', July 20, 2008; and the weblog [http://futuresoflearning.org/index.php/Firda_08/tag/japan Futures of Learning: Japan]. In her [http://rccs.usfca.edu/bookinfo.asp?ReviewID=286&amp;BookID=239 review of the work], Leslie M. Tkach-Kawasaki opined:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

In this chapter, the use of technology not only as a tool for forging personal relationships but also as a means of mediating one's relationship with society as a whole is especially intriguing. These illustrations of how new technologies are being used to renegotiate one's self on a personal basis as well as in relation to society as a whole are especially germane to a Japan that seeks balance within itself and the world around it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as has his grounded theorization of media-reproduced "surveillance" in Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;"Surveillance: Japan's sustaining principle," ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Vol. 28, Issue 1 (Summer 1994):93-102. This article served as the theoretical core of Dorota Krysinska's “[http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-10272006-180946/unrestricted/Krysinska_Dorota_October_2006.pdf Hikikomori (Social Withdrawal) in Japan]: Discourses of Media and Scholars; Multicausal Explanations of the Phenomenon”. Holden's pithy turn of phrase ("Discreet statements of difference for those wishing to be considered as discrete statements") -- which aptly captures the expression of individual identity through material culture under conditions of extensive social control -- was reprised by [[Brian J. McVeigh]] in his ''Japanese Higher Education as Myth'' (2002:120).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the core attention to media/tion, Holden’s overriding concern has been the interaction between indigenous and exogenous values and practices – what is generally referred to as "[[globalization]]". This intellectual thread is directly traceable back to Agnew’s "landmark" study of place,&lt;ref&gt;This characterization belongs to Fred M. Shelley, in his "[http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/27/5/605.pdf Commentary, Classics in human geography revisited]", published in ''Progress in Human Geography'' 27,5 (2003) p.605.&lt;/ref&gt; completed during Holden's final year at SU.&lt;ref&gt;See Agnew, J.A. (1987), ''Place and politics: the geographical mediation of state and society''. Boston and London: Allen and Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt; For Holden, it is the mediation between people, media technologies and communication content in specific contexts that best accounts for political, cultural, and social phenomena, (and thereby reveals the contours and extent of globalization). This focus is most evident and best captured in the title of his 2006 book ''medi@sia: Global media/tion in and out of context'' (co-edited with Timothy J. Scrase). Even so, this geo-symbolic mediation can be discerned a decade earlier, in his comparative content analysis of 3,059 Japanese and American television ads,&lt;ref&gt;Todd Joseph Miles Holden, "[http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/iis/1/1/93/_pdf Standardizing Information Society]?: A Comparative Study of Commercial Culture," ''Interdisciplinary Information Sciences'', Vol. 1 (1994), No.1, pp.93-102.&lt;/ref&gt; and his study of differential presentations of the body in national advertisements&lt;ref&gt;Todd Joseph Miles Holden, "The Commercialized Body: A comparative study of culture and values," ''Interdisciplinary Information Sciences'', (November 1996), Vol.2, No.2:199-215&lt;/ref&gt; – a research topic that also bears some echoes of Glassner’s body study, launched during the latter's time at SU.

The question of place also arises in Holden’s widely circulated&lt;ref&gt;The paper is often posted as a resource for/representative work on gender advertising on compilation sites; see, for instance this site on [http://newton.uor.edu/Departments&amp;Programs/AsianStudiesDept/japan-women.html Japan: Women &amp; Family Issues], sponsored by the University of Redlands, and this site on [http://www.uiowa.edu/~commstud/resources/GenderMedia/advertising.html Gender, Race and Ethnicity in Media (Advertising)], sponsored by the University of Iowa Department of Communication Studies. The article has also been frequently cited by other authors; see, for instance: Michael Prieler, (2007) "[http://www.dijtokyo.org/doc/JS19_Prieler.pdf The Japanese Advertising Family]," in P. Backhaus (Ed.), ''Japanstudien 19: Familienangelegenheiten'' (pp. 207-220). Munich: iudicium; and Mark McLelland, (2003) ''[http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/717220_751306748_902955256.pdf Western Intersections, Eastern Approximations]: Living more like 'oneself': transgender identities and sexualities in Japan''.&lt;/ref&gt; updating, to Japan, of [[Goffman]]'s classic “gender advertisements”. This Japanese study, Medcalf noted, demonstrates that discrepancies in the hetero-normative narrative are “not a result of post-modern, globalizing transformations, but, rather, of long standing internal cultural and historical processes and contradictions.”&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie Medcalf, “[http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue3/introduction.html Cultural Representations, Translations, Appropriations]: Spaces, Media and Performance: Introduction,” ''Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context'' (Issue 3, January 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Such complex relationships between gender, media and local distinctiveness were further explored in a much-sampled 2005 article on masculinities in Japanese cooking shows.&lt;ref&gt;The original article, "The Overcooked and Underdone: Masculinities in Japanese food programming", appeared in ''Food and Foodways Explorations in the History and Culture of Human Nourishment'', Volume 13, Issue 1 &amp; 2 (2005), pp.39-65, then was re-issued in Carole Counihan and Penny Van Esterik (eds.), ''Food and Culture: A Reader'' (2nd Ed.), (2007), pp.202-220. It then was picked up for use in classes at the University of Georgia ("[http://uga.edu/anthro/syllabi/3541_velasquezrunk_fa08.pdf Anthropology of Eating]: Environment, History, Culture, and Politics") and Saint Michael’s College ("[http://academics.smcvt.edu/mbosia/PDFFolder/FS%20138%20A%20Spring%2007%20Syllabus.pdf The Politics of Food]").&lt;/ref&gt;

Holden has also employed other approaches to expose the distinctiveness of place-based ideas and practices. For instance, qualitative, semiotic-attuned content analysis demonstrated the integral role color plays in generating cultural meaning in American and Japanese advertising.&lt;ref&gt;See: "The Color of Meaning: The significance of black and white in television commercials," ''Interdisciplinary Information Sciences'' (1997), Vol.3, No.2:125-146; "The Color of Difference: Critiquing cultural convergence via television advertising," ''Interdisciplinary Information Sciences'', Vol.5, No.1 (May 1999):15-36).&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of such research, Patrick Hunout has observed, is that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Holden points to numerous localized practices, which do not transcend national/cultural borders. Context-specific meanings serve to underscore the limits on globalization; they indicate the large degree to which cultures communicate in distinct, unique ways. Coloration becomes more than a semiological tool; it provides insight into societal ontology. It can be used to explain how cultures have been organized, how they “think” and even suggest, at times, why they act.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hunout, "The New Leviathan, Tolkien, and 'Empire'," ''The International Scope Review'', Volume 4 (2002), Issue 8 (Winter), Editorial.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That said, not all of his studies of mediation in context have found clear-cut divergence. His ethnographic study of the advent of [[political consultant]]s and [[TV spot|spot]]-centered campaigns in the 1996 Japanese national elections&lt;ref&gt;See: "'How Can We Say it in 15 Seconds?': Assessing Japan's first mass media election," ''Japanese Society'', Vol.2 (1997):77-97; "Commercialized Politics: Japan's new mass mediated reality," ''Japanese Studies'', Vol.19, No.1 (May 1999):33-47).&lt;/ref&gt; were highly supportive of creeping convergence, as was his content analysis of what he has labeled “adentity”. In the latter case, messages of self-identification in Japan, while becoming more locally profuse and variegated, have also become exogenously-homogeneous—insofar as their self-orientation appears more similar to ad messages from the West. Appraising the implications of Holden's grounded theorization, Kenji Kosaka observed that such adentifications reflect a departure from the past, where identity was often mediated by the group. To Kosaka, Holden's study was further evidence that Japanese society had evolved from its original collectivistic values to more individualistic values.&lt;ref&gt;See Kenji Kosaka, “Where Does Asia Go? Transitions in Asia-Pacific Societies,” ''The International Scope Review'', Volume 2 (2000), Issue 4 (Winter), Editorial.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Academic Involvements==
Between 1989 and 1994 Holden served as Head Coach of the men’s basketball team at Tohoku University.&lt;ref&gt;This according to a commissioned feature ''My Tohoku Epoch, This Japanese Life'', [http://www.popmatters.com/features/tttp/7holden1.shtml published by PopMatters], as well as data listed on [http://www.intcul.tohoku.ac.jp/~holden/CV.html Holden's on-line CV].&lt;/ref&gt; A perennial Division 2 bottom-dweller, the team ascended to Division 1 in Holden’s second season at the helm. It also won the prestigious [[:ja:全国七大学総合体育大会|Seven Universities' Competition]]&lt;ref&gt;Note: page in Japanese; see also: [http://7-u.jp/index.htm the official home page] of the Seven Universities Competition&lt;/ref&gt; the same year,&lt;ref&gt;Final 1990 results for all schools in all sports, [http://7-u.jp/rekidai/result/30.html here] (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; Tohoku University’s first basketball championship in 32 years.&lt;ref&gt;1968 final results for all schools in all sports [http://7-u.jp/rekidai/result/06.html here] (in Japanese). Data for all years of the competition accessible [http://7-u.jp/rekidai.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming a fixture at youth basketball camps in the [[Tohoku region]], Holden was offered the head coaching job with a professional women’s basketball team sponsored by [[Yamagata Bank]]. In his first year, 1994–95, the team qualified for the play-in round for promotion to the First Division—the first time a team from Tohoku had earned this chance. His year coaching a women's professional team was briefly described in his ''PM'' feature on Tohoku and is the basis for the unpublished manuscript, ''Red Dot, Orange Rock, Blues''.

==Literary career==
After writing a column about Japanese popular culture for nearly a decade for the ezine ''PopMatters'' and penning over 600 entries in an online travelblog, Holden published the memoir, ''Peripatetic Postcards: The journey of life, through 25 of the world's cities'', in 2010. Holden characterizes the work as a literary memoir of being and becoming; a set of lessons about life and musings on the human condition by a writer searching to find his way. The book opens by outlining a philosophy for undertaking the journey of life—what Holden calls “peripatacity”—and then enumerates a set of rules for conducting the journey. Subsequent chapters focus on the processes, people, places, predicaments, and philosophies encountered along life’s road. A final chapter personifies the journey by following the progress of the author, his wife and bi-cultural children on road trips through their native America and Japan—trips that prompt reflections on childhood, death, love, fate, God, happiness, family, home, place, personal growth, and the meaning of life. Throughout, ''Peripatetic Postcards'' operates at two levels: seeking to convey the panoply of human experience for those looking to broaden their understanding of the human condition in an increasingly globalized world, while also providing a model for discovery, personified in the author's experience.

In 2013 Holden published a novel, ''Mr. Big Maus'', a caper centering on contemporary corporate culture run amok and one iconoclast's mission to rebalance an unjust world. ''Mr. Big Maus'' is a blend of late-modern, contemporary, and post-modern sensibilities, with a plot that is linear and integrated, which eschews mysticism, and provides action that is sudden, direct and rational.{{citation needed|reason=Needs reliable, third-party sources|date=September 2014}} This is countered by a narrative that is ironic, characters who are self-reflexive yet irrational, and spiced with the nuance of metafiction.{{citation needed|reason=Needs reliable, third-party sources|date=September 2014}} Its protagonist is flawed, disempowered, contending with alienation, and questing to discover identity. The plot presents universal themes within the context of everyday life and features evolution in its character’s lives. It offers the audience a moral resolution.{{citation needed|reason=Needs reliable, third-party sources|date=September 2014}} Substantively, the book spotlights history and memory, celebrates intellect and speech, and is optimistic and ultimately uplifting.{{citation needed|reason=Needs reliable, third-party sources|date=September 2014}} Among its key themes is discourse about: time, consciousness and human practices. This is seen, above all, through the constant presence, use, and dependence on technology (i.e. the emerging present and looming future), in contrast to the protagonist's constant nostalgia for a reliance on products of cinema, music, television and literature (i.e. the recent and distant past). A second theme is the changing America landscape—reflected in its ubiquitous immigrants—as well as the clash of generational and institutional values. A final theme, built from strands of the previous two, is the ways that innovation, invention, commercialization and business influence and are influenced by the poles of technological determinism and independent creative expression.

Holden's current projects include two novels about the events surrounding Japan's triple disaster of March 11, 2011: ''Tsunami'' and ''Escape from Sonoyo''. The former, covers the disaster in sixteen self-contained, interconnected stories; the latter centers on the ordeals of one family divided, in search of themselves and one another. Combined, the books present a portrait of loss, heroism, survival, and perseverance through the eyes of victims, witnesses, rescuers, refugees, reporters, civil authorities, soldiers and criminals. The result can be read as more than a record of one period in a particular nation’s history, but a universal story of sacrifice, heartbreak, faith, redemption and transcendence during crisis.{{citation needed|reason=Needs reliable, third-party sources|date=September 2014}}

Other projects in various stages of development include: ''Red Dot, Orange Rock, Blues'', an autobiographical meditation on being and becoming, based on Holden's six years coaching men’s collegiate and women’s professional basketball in Japan; ''The Seekers of Wisdom'', a novel blending the prodigal return, philosophical detection, high school sports, the literary canon, hard-boiled mystery and police procedural; and ''Orphan 7Y-05-O'', a dystopian tale centering on a training school for terrorists and, possibly, capitalist democracy's inescapable future.

==Personal==
Holden was born in [[Pasadena, California]] in 1958. He is the son of Joseph T. Holden, PhD, a [[biochemist]], [[Emeritus]] Senior Scientist, and Director Emeritus of the [[Beckman Research Institute]] at the [[City of Hope National Medical Center]]. His mother, Nancy Holden, attended the original [[Little Red School House (New York, New York)|Little Red School House]] in [[New York City]], and later earned an MS. A career educator, she founded a program for special needs children in Los Angeles and has been active as board member and president of various Jewish genealogy societies. Holden attended The Chandler School and was one of only four students to graduate from its short-lived high school. During that time he played on the same football team as [[Drew Pinsky]] (also known as “Dr. Drew”). Holden's wife, Takako, and his children, Maya and Alex, play prominent roles in the concluding chapter of ''Peripatetic Postcards''. ''Mr. Big Maus'' is dedicated to Maya and Alex, as well as Holden's father.

{{Nihongo|'''Valkyrie'''|ヴァルキリー|Varukirī}}, sometimes styled '''VALKYRIE''' in capitals, was a  [[women's mixed martial arts]] (MMA) promotion. It was the sister of Japanese MMA promotion [[Cage Force]], both operated by Greatest Common Multiple (GCM) Communication. Contrary to other Japanese women MMA promotions at the time, it featured a cage instead of a ring and used the same venues as Cage Force.

==History==
Around {{start date|df=yes|2004}}, GCM Communication, the parent company of Japanese promotion Cage Force, had already hosted some all-women MMA events named ''Cross Section''&lt;ref name="start"&gt;{{Cite web

After several months with no news from the promotion, on {{start date|df=yes|2011|04|13}}, in a notable development for female MMA promotions in Japan, Yasuko Mogi, matchmaker of Valkyrie, in an effort to keep Valkyrie alive, given that GCM Communication was apparently out of business with no other event planned, was present during the press conference of Jewels and announced along with Shigeru Saeki, Jewels matchmaker, that some of the MMA bouts of the {{Start date|df=yes||05|14}} Jewels event would have the theme ''Jewels vs Valkyrie'', where fighters representing their respective promotions would face each other, starting with Misaki Takimoto vs. [[Naho Sugiyama]] and Miyoko Kusaka vs. Sachiko Yamamoto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After the Jewels vs. Valkyrie theme in ''[[Jewels 13th Ring &amp; 14th Ring]]'', followed also in ''[[Jewels 15th Ring]]'', and due to the lack of Valkyrie events, fighters from the Valkyrie promotion started joining rival Japanese promotion Jewels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A few weeks later, at ''[[Jewels 17th Ring]]'' on {{Start date|df=yes|2013|12|17}} Yasuko Mogi became the matchmaker of Jewels and this effectively meant the end for the Valkyrie promotion.

==Rules==
Generally speaking, the rules were based on Cage Force rules, which in turn were similar to the [[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]], minus elbow strikes to the head and no [[Mixed martial arts#Ground-and-pound|ground-and-pound]] in amateur bouts.&lt;ref name="start 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite web

'''WeeWorld''' was an online game and messaging website, originally created in 2002 with a company that was based in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], with a few offices in [[London]] and [[Boston]], as well as other cities in the USA. The company had created [[WeeWorld.com]], formally known as a social networking site, to which was mostly geared towards teens and tweens. The website is also known for its brand of instant messaging and chat-based avatars, known as “WeeMees”, Which was also released on a variety of digital platforms and services. There were approximately 180 million WeeMees created worldwide, but the site was unexpectedly shut down, as of May 11, 2017. From then on, there has not been anymore information from WeeWorld or the company itself. It is said that the company could no longer profit off of WeeWorld, and the only option left was to sell it to the new owners, who had then decided to shut it down.&lt;ref name="about us"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.weeworld.com/about/index.html | title= WeeWorld - About Us | website=WeeWorld.com | publisher = | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==WeeMees==
{{Main|WeeMee}}

=== Description ===
WeeMees are two-dimensional cartoon avatars that WeeWorld users are issued when first joining the community. Users can purchase virtual goods for their avatars, such as clothing, accessories, and food and drink items. As WeeWorld's target demographic is teenagers, many of the virtual goods reflect current [[pop culture]] and [[celebrity]] fashion trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bub.blicio.us/teens-still-spend-on-virtual-goods-says-weeworld | title= Teens Still Spend on Virtual Goods, Says WeeWorld | publisher = Bub.blicio.us | access-date = 10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotions and partnership==
WeeWorld has partnered with corporations such as [[AOL]], [[MSN]] and [[Skype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/09/29/weeworld-forms-a-partnership-with-aol/ | title= WeeWorld forms a partnership with AOL? | publisher = TechCrunch | access-date = 10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a partnership with [[RCA]], it has promoted artists such as [[Alicia Keys]] and [[Avril Lavigne]] through virtual merchandise sales and WeeMees of the respective artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2008/04/rca-extends-rel.html |title=RCA Extends Relationship with WeeWorld to Promote Alicia Keys |publisher=Virtual Worlds News |access-date=9 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525134715/http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2008/04/rca-extends-rel.html |archivedate=25 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  WeeWorld has also promoted artists such as the [[Jonas Brothers]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Raven-Symoné]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevirtualscoop.com/raven-symone-joins-weeworld/ |title=Raven Symone Joins WeeWorld |publisher=Virtual Worlds News |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707031407/http://thevirtualscoop.com/raven-symone-joins-weeworld/ |archivedate=7 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pussycat Dolls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marketingvox.com/industry-buzz-snippets-011509-042801/ | title= Industry Buzz &amp; Snippets: 01/15/09 | publisher = Marketing Vox | access-date = 6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justin Bieber]], and [[Taylor Swift]].

In 2003, Microsoft began offering the avatars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3139754.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Scotland - 'Weemees' move into the big time|author=|date=|website=news.BBC.co.uk|access-date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use to their Hotmail customers via the MSN chat service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/weeworld-extends-msn-partnership-to-ten-countries--517977|title=WeeWorld extends MSN partnership to ten countries|author=|date=|website=www.Telecompaper.com|access-date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new service attracted 150,000 users during the first day of the avatars being launched, with the WeeMee website attracting 1.5 million hits daily. In 2004 the UK's largest social network, Friendsreunited.com, also introduced the WeeMee to their user base. In December 2008 the virtual technology firm DA agreed to develop a 3-D version of the avatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://econsultancy.com/nma-archive/42738-da-develops-3d-animated-avatars|title=DA develops 3D animated avatars|author=|date=|website=Econsultancy.com|access-date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was run by a rookie CEO, Celia Francis and went into liquidation in 2014.  Was then sold to Glasgow business Opinurate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big bids expected for WeeWorld owned by Glasgo firm in administration|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13290576.Big_bids_expected_for_WeeWorld_owned_by_Glasgow_firm_in_administration/|website=eveningtimes.co.uk|publisher=Evening Times|date=September 4, 2014|access-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who closed the website down earlier in 2017.

The '''Words &amp; Pictures Museum of Fine Sequential Art''' was an [[art museum]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] devoted to exhibitions of [[narrative art]], [[cartoons]], [[comic books]], and [[graphic novels]]. Open to the public from 1992 to 1999, the Museum's collection at one point numbered 20,000 original works from hundreds of artists including [[Simon Bisley]], [[Vaughn Bodē]], [[Robert Crumb]], [[Richard Corben]], [[Frank Frazetta]], [[Jaime Hernandez]], [[Jack Kirby]],&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Jon B.

== History ==
The Museum was founded in 1990&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.wordsandpictures.org/museumhistory.cfm "Museum History"]. Words &amp; Pictures Museum website. Accessed Jan. 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; by artist [[Kevin Eastman]], co-creator of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]].&lt;ref&gt;Kreiner, Rich. "The Museum Built on the Backs of Turtles: the Words &amp; Pictures Museum of Northampton, Massachusetts", ''The Comics Journal'' #167 (April 1994), pp. 78–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially located in Northampton's Roundhouse Building,&lt;ref name=history /&gt; the Museum opened its doors on October 9, 1992.

In late 1994, the Museum moved to the Beardsley Building (named for [[British citizen|English]] illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]]),&lt;ref name=history /&gt; into a state-of-the-art four-floor facility in downtown Northampton,&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, Charles. "Newswatch: Art News: The New, Expanded Words &amp; Pictures Museum: The Second Time Around". ''The Comics Journal'' #176 (April 1995), pp. 19–26.&lt;/ref&gt; which it occupied until its closing.

'''Zen Studios''' is an international [[video game developer]] and publisher of interactive entertainment software with headquarters in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] and offices in the United States. It is known for its game franchises, ''[[Pinball FX]]'' and ''[[Zen Pinball]]'', as well as ''[[CastleStorm]]'', a [[tower defense]] hybrid which received the Apple Store's Editor’s Choice award.&lt;ref name=Eurogamer2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=XLC /&gt; The company is considered "synonymous with [[media franchise|licensed]] pinball tables," having produced dozens of tables with characters and themes from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' and [[Marvel Universe|Marvel]] universes, films like ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', TV series like ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'', and video game franchises such as ''[[Plants vs. Zombies]]'', ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', ''[[Street Fighter]]'', and ''[[The Walking Dead (video game)|The Walking Dead]]''.&lt;ref name=Blend&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Zen-Studios-Force-Awakens-Pinball-Review-Tables-You-re-Looking-112817.html |title = Zen Studios' The Force Awakens Pinball Review: These Are The Tables You're Looking For |author = Ryan Winslett |publisher = Cinema Blend |date = January 2016 |accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trends /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hard&gt;{{cite web |url = http://diehardgamefan.com/2015/10/28/review-zen-pinball-2-ant-man-sony-playstation-3playstation-4playstation-vita/ |title = Review: Zen Pinball 2: Ant-Man (Sony Playstation 3/Playstation 4/Playstation Vita) |author = Mark B. |publisher = Diehard Game Fan |date = 15 July 2015 |accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The company's games have been released for various game platforms, including [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], [[Wii U]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[App Store (iOS)|iOS]], [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and [[Google Play|Android]].&lt;ref name=Bam&gt;{{cite web |url = http://bamsmackpow.com/2015/07/14/ant-man-pinball-arrives-in-zen-studios-pinball-this-week/ |title = Ant-Man Pinball Arrives In Zen Studios Pinball This Week |author = Nick Tylwalk |publisher = Bam!

== History ==
 
Zen Studios was founded in [[Budapest]] in 2003 by a team of four people. It started as a technology and work for hire studio, doing [[game engine]] development, [[middleware]] tools, and [[porting|ports]] for other games.&lt;ref name=Beat /&gt; The company name is based on the team's belief in [[Zen]] as a creed to follow in their work and lives, specifically with employees and fans.&lt;ref name=World&gt;{{cite web |url = http://gamesworld.blox.pl/2011/02/Designing-in-unconventional-ways-an-interview.html |title = Designing in unconventional ways - an interview with ZEN Studios |publisher = Gamesworld |date = 3 February 2011 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time [[PlayStation Network]] and [[Xbox Live Arcade]] arrived, the studio had gained knowledge and experience with [[video game console|console platforms]] and [[handheld game console|gaming handhelds]]. The company [[chief executive officer|CEO]] Zsolt Kigyossy, a [[pinball]] fan, decided to try to make the best pinball [[simulation video game]] on the market.&lt;ref name=Beat&gt;{{cite web |url = https://venturebeat.com/2013/08/23/how-zen-studios-became-a-successful-indie-game-studio-and-cranked-out-kickbeat-interview/ |title = How Zen Studios became a successful indie game studio and cranked out KickBeat (interview) |author = Dean Takahashi |publisher = Venture Beat |date = 23 August 2013 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Its first pinball game was ''[[Pinball FX]]'', released for [[Xbox 360]] in 2007. It would sell more than 100,000 copies per year until 2010. Because ''Pinball FX'' was published by [[Microsoft]], it could not appear on [[Sony]]’s [[PlayStation 3]], leading to the development of ''[[Zen Pinball]]'' for the PS3 in 2008 (and later for [[iOS]], the [[Wii U]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]).&lt;ref name=Trends&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/bobs-burgers-family-guy-tables-coming-to-pinball-fx/ |title = Bob’s Burgers, Family Guy get Pinball FX and Zen Pinball tables |author = Danny Cowan |publisher = Digital Trends |date = 7 October 2015 |accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Life&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lifezette.com/popzette/pinball-then-and-now/ |title = Pinball Then... and Now |author = Josh Smith |publisher = LifeZette |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zen Pinball'' was the top-selling [[PlayStation Network|PSN]] game in May and September 2009.&lt;ref name=Engadget&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.engadget.com/2009/08/06/interview-zen-studios-zsolt-kigyossy/ |title = Interview: ZEN Studios' Zsolt Kigyossy |author = Andrew Yoon |publisher = Engadget |date = 6 August 2009 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Engadget2&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.engadget.com/2010/10/19/zen-pinball-and-castle-crashers-top-psn-sales-in-september/ |title = Zen Pinball and Castle Crashers top PSN sales in September |author = Andrew Yoon |publisher = Engadget |date = 19 October 2009 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The company made the first of its three departures from pinball when it released ''[[The Punisher: No Mercy]]'' in 2009. This [[first-person shooter]] in the style of the ''[[The Punisher (2004 series)|Punisher MAX]]'' franchise was released for Playstation 3.&lt;ref name=Engadget /&gt; The company embarked on what would become its biggest [[media franchise]] cooperation yet when they teamed up with [[Marvel Comics]] and released ''[[Marvel Pinball]]'' in December 2010.&lt;ref name=Zone&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gamezone.com/news/zen_studios_unveils_marvel_pinball |title = Zen Studios Unveils "Marvel Pinball" |publisher = Gamezone |date = 27 September 2011 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooperation has resulted in twenty-one different pinball tables based on the [[Marvel Universe]], with more anticipated in the future.&lt;ref name=Hard /&gt; Another big franchise used for Zen Studios tables is [[Lucasfilm]]'s and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]''. In 2012, the company debuted ''Star Wars Pinball,'' the first pack to feature officially licensed digital ''Star Wars'' pinball tables.&lt;ref name=Beat /&gt;
 
In 2013, Zen Studios released two non-pinball games. The company tackled the [[tower defense]] genre with ''[[CastleStorm]]'' for [[Xbox Live Arcade|XBLA]], a hybrid of traditional tower defense with real-time physics-based ''[[Angry Birds]]''-esque catapult combat and resource management.&lt;ref name=Eurogamer2&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-20-zen-studios-tower-defense-rts-hybrid-castlestorm-lays-siege-on-xbla-next-week |title = Zen Studios' tower-defense/RTS hybrid CastleStorm lays siege on XBLA next week |author = Jeffrey Matulef |publisher = Eurogamer |date = 20 May 2013 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''CastleStorm'' would go on to become a successful franchise, earning the Editor’s Choice award in the US [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App Store]], as well as an Editor’s Choice distinction from [[Google Play]].&lt;ref name=XLC&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.xlcgamingnetwork.com/netease-and-zen-studios-partner-to-launch-castlestorm-in-mainland-china/ |title = NetEase and Zen Studios Partner to Launch CastleStorm in Mainland China |author = no1phil |publisher = XLC Gaming Network |date = 3 June 2015 |accessdate = 23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhythm-based [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]] game ''[[KickBeat]]'' debuted on the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3.&lt;ref name=Beat /&gt; On the pinball side, Zen Studios released ''Super League Football'' in 2014, where players competed by siding with their favorite [[UEFA|European football]] clubs and famous players. The game was seen as a modern version of the famous pinball machine ''[[World Cup Soccer (pinball)|World Cup Soccer]]'' from 1994.&lt;ref name=Advice3&gt;{{cite web |url = http://appadvice.com/appnn/2014/01/prepare-for-hard-kicking-pinball-action-in-zen-studios-super-league-football |title = Prepare For Hard-Kicking Pinball Action In Zen Studios' Super League Football |author = Aldrin Calimlim |publisher = App Advice |date = 29 January 2014 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year saw the release of a ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' table.&lt;ref name=Destructoid&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.destructoid.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-pinball-may-be-the-best-table-yet-278984.phtml |title = Guardians of the Galaxy Pinball may be the best table yet |author = Brett Zeidler |publisher = Destructoid |date = 2 August 2014 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The company partnered with [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] in mid-2015 to create digital pinball tables based on [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]'s games,&lt;ref name=PC&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pcgamer.com/zen-studios-tease-valve-pinball-game/ |title = Zen Studios tease Valve pinball game |author = Ian Dransfield |publisher = PC Gamer |date = 29 April 2015 |accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably the ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' table.&lt;ref name=Age&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gaming-age.com/2015/06/portal-pinball-for-zen-pinball-2-pinball-fx2-review/ |title = Portal Pinball for Zen Pinball 2, Pinball FX2 review |author = Chris Dunlap |publisher = Gaming Age |date = 2 June 2015 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Zen Studios' licensed tables included a table based on [[The Walking Dead (video game)|Telltale Game’s ''The Walking Dead'']] and on the TV show ''[[South Park]]''. The new ''Iron &amp; Steel'' collection consisted of a table based on ''CastleStorm'' and the studio's first wholly original table in three years, ''Wild West Rampage''.&lt;ref name=Blend2&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cinemablend.com/games/South-Park-Pinball-Review-Zen-Studios-Flipping-Nails-It-67827.html |title = South Park Pinball Review: Zen Studios Flipping Nails It |author = Ryan Winslett |publisher = Cinema Blend |date = April 2015 |accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In early 2016, Zen Studios teamed up with [[Oculus Rift]] to create pinball tables in [[virtual reality]]. Pinball FX2 VR, which features three original table designs from the Zen Studios development team, was released on the Oculus Rift’s launch day, March 28, 2016.&lt;ref name=Shack&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.shacknews.com/article/93741/pinball-fx2-vr-eyes-on-at-gdc-2016 |title = Pinball FX2 VR: Eyes-on at GDC 2016 |author = Ozzie Mejia |publisher = Shack News |date = 16 March 2016 |accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Game design ==
 
Zen Studios' pinball style has been called "cinematic".&lt;ref name=Destructoid /&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/14/zen-pinball-2-new-tables-flipper-fun |title = Zen Pinball 2 review: new tables – great flipper fun |author = Serge Pennings |publisher = The Guardian |date = 14 September 2014 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to capture the mood of a game or franchise, its tables include spoken lines, animations and deep references from movies, TV or animated shows they are based on,&lt;ref name=PC /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gazette&gt;{{cite web |url = http://gazette.com/video-game-haiku-review-balls-of-glory-pinball/article/1561469 |title = Video Game Haiku Review - "Balls of Glory Pinball" |author = Terry Terrones |publisher = Colorado Springs Gazette |date = 17 October 2015 |accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; weaving those references into the action in a fun and interesting way.&lt;ref name=Hardcore&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2015/06/06/review-portal-pinball/152225/ |title = Review: Portal Pinball |author = Thomas Ella |publisher = Hardcore Gamer |date = 6 June 2015 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each table is a separately designed game, with distinct layouts and graphical styles.&lt;ref name=Macworld&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.macworld.com/article/2606969/you-should-play-zen-pinball.html |title = You Should Play: Zen Pinball |author = Andrew Hayward |publisher = Macworld |date = 12 September 2014 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the ''Star Wars''-themed tables, for example, "feels inextricable from the universe, its elements combining into something truly evocative,"&lt;ref name=Eurogamer&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-05-star-wars-pinball-the-empire-strikes-back-review |title = Star Wars Pinball: The Empire Strikes Back review |author = Rich Stanton |publisher = Eurogamer |date = 5 April 2013 |accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''-based table "faithfully recreates the aesthetic of the film and makes good use of the notable elements in the table design."&lt;ref name=Hard /&gt; In ''[[The Walking Dead (video game)|The Walking Dead]]'' pinball game, there is no playing table. Instead, the field of play is surrounded by scale representations of the most memorable set pieces from each of the episodes contained in [[The Walking Dead (season 1)|''The Walking Dead: Season One'']].&lt;ref name=Destructoid2&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.destructoid.com/the-walking-dead-pinball-is-just-as-good-as-i-had-hoped-280183.phtml |title = The Walking Dead Pinball is just as good as I had hoped |author = Brett Zeidler |publisher = Destructoid |date = 26 August 2014 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On the other hand, its tables have been praised for their "realism", which means that they try to create the illusion that "you're at an [[amusement arcade|arcade]] or in your basement with your eyes peeled to the table in front", and that the ball physics make "predicting angles and opportune [[Pinball#Flippers|flipper]] timing as natural as possible".&lt;ref name=Digest2&gt;{{cite web |url = http://games.highdefdigest.com/11371/zen_pinball_2_ps4.html |title = Zen Pinball 2 |author = Trevor Ruben |publisher = High-Def Digest |date = 9 March 2014 |accessdate = 7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Microtransactions ==
 
The company's first game, ''Pinball FX'', introduced [[microtransaction]]s in the world of pinball gaming, since additional tables were available for purchase. At the launches of ''Pinball FX2'' and ''Zen Pinball 2'', pinball tables could be exported for free from the previous games into the sequels. Upon release of the [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]], ''Pinball FX2'' and ''Zen Pinball 2'' respectively were [[porting|ported over]], and allowed owners of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions (via Cross-Buy) to import their purchased tables onto the new platform when available at no additional cost. Tables are available for purchase either individually or as part of themed packs.&lt;ref name=Trends /&gt;&lt;ref name=Life /&gt;&lt;ref name=Push2&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2013/09/interview_kickin_back_with_kickbeat_developer_zen_studios |title = Interview: Kickin' Back with KickBeat Developer Zen Studios |author = Sammy Barker |publisher = Push Square |date = 5 September 2013 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Push&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/psn/zen_pinball_2 |title = Review: Zen Pinball 2 |author = Mike Mason |publisher = Push Square |date = 1 October 2012 |accessdate = 8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Čičiliusku''' ([[Karelian language|Karelian]] for ''[[viviparous lizard]]'') is a [[Puppetry|puppet theatre]] company from the [[Republic of Karelia]] in [[Russia]]. The company performs in the [[Karelian language]]. The company was founded in 2005 at the initiative of [[Pekka Zaikov]], who at the time was the head of the Department of the Karelian and [[Veps language|Veps]] languages. Amongst those who founded the company were teachers, students and [[alumnus|alumni]] of the Faculty of Baltic Finnic languages of the [[Petrozavodsk State University]]. A year later the company performed their first play, ''Kuin hukka vasikalla muamona oli'' (‘When the Wolf Stood in for the Calf’s Mother’).&lt;ref name =NuoriKarjala&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Čičiliusku performs for all kinds of audiences both in their home state and abroad, they want to target Karelian speaking people in the peripheral areas of Karelia, especially the youth, and inspire them to be more active in the use of the Karelian language. The shows are free, although the company hopes that the spectators would provide them with financial support, each according to his or her means.&lt;ref name=NuoriKarjala /&gt;

The members of the Čičiliusku company, ca. 15 persons, represent the same groups as those who founded the company. The members of the company are Karelian language and Karelian political activists who are active in the association [[Nuori Karjala]] (‘Young Karelia’) and the political movement [[Karjalan rahvahan liitto]] (‘Karelian People’s Union’).&lt;ref name=NuoriKarjala /&gt; Čičiliusku is one of the most successful projects of Nuori Karjala.&lt;ref name=SVSeura&gt;{{cite web

The company have their rehearsals in the Cultural Centre of the Karelian Republic, and the centre provides them with financial support. They also receive support from the Karelian Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref name=NuoriKarjala /&gt;

The head of the company is Natal’ya Golubovskaya, who has been a member ever since the company was founded. The props and the puppets are supplied by Marina Zlenko and Boris Kudryavcev, while Oleg Gureyev is in charge of the music.&lt;ref name=NuoriKarjala /&gt;

The company performs in the [[Livvi-Karelian language|Livvi]] and the [[Karelian language#North Karelian|North Karelian]] languages, both languages being used in each performance. The company does not perform in the Central Karelian language (the latter being the same language variant as [[Karelian language#Tver Karelian|Tver Karelian]]).&lt;ref name=NuoriKarjala /&gt; The plays consist of well-known folk stories and of various life situations that are familiar to all people. The company strives to present the plays in such a way that enables even those with little or no knowledge of Karelian to follow them. The puppets make it easier for the audience to grasp the essence of the plays.&lt;ref name=NuoriKarjala /&gt;&lt;ref name=SVSeura /&gt;

Čičiliusku visited [[Finland]] during November 10–17, 2012, and performed two plays, ''[[Canine Kalevala]]'', based on the book of the same title by the Finnish [[cartoonist]] and [[author]] [[Mauri Kunnas]], and the aforementioned ''Kuin hukka vasikalla muamona oli'' (‘When the Wolf Stood in for the Calf’s Mother’). The Finnish [[premiere]] of ''Canine Kalevala'' was in [[Sastamala]] on November 10, 2012, and a repeat of the play was seen in [[Tampere]] the following day. The tour ended in [[Helsinki]] on November 17.&lt;ref name=SVSeura /&gt;

''Canine Kalevala'' is the first [[Kalevala]] related work to have been published in the North Karelian language, the language of the area from which the bulk of the Kalevala was collected by [[Elias Lönnrot]]. It was translated by Nadezhda Lutokhina, and it was published by [[Karjalan Sivistysseura]] (‘Society for the Promotion of the Karelian Culture’) in 2010.&lt;ref name=SVSeura /&gt;
