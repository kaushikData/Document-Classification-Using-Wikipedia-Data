==Background==
The concept of the oceanic anoxic event (OAE) was first proposed in 1976 by Seymour Schlanger (1927–1990) and geologist Hugh Jenkyns&lt;ref name="HistOfOil-2"&gt;History Channel, "The History of Oil" (2007), Australian Broadcasting System, Inc.&lt;!--may be out of context --&gt;, aired: 2:00-4:00 pm EDST, 2008-07-08; Note: [[Geologist]] Hugh Jenkyns was interviewed in the History Channel's (re: footnote:3 History Channel, "The History of Oil" (2007)) documentary "The History of Oil" and attributed the matching occurrence high in the [[Apennine Mountains]]' meter thick black shale band put together with the findings from the [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] as triggering the theory and work that followed from a beginning ca 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; and arose from discoveries made by the [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] (DSDP) in the Pacific Ocean. It was the finding of black carbon-rich shales in Cretaceous sediments that had accumulated on submarine [[volcanic plateau]]s ([[Shatsky Rise]], [[Manihiki Plateau]]), coupled with the fact that they were identical in age with similar deposits cored from the Atlantic Ocean and known from outcrops in Europe - particularly in the geological record of the otherwise limestone-dominated [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]&lt;ref name="HistOfOil-2"/&gt; chain in Italy - that led to the realization that these widespread similar [[stratigraphy|strata]] recorded highly unusual oxygen-depleted conditions in the world ocean during several discrete periods of [[geological time scale|geological time]].

Sedimentological investigations of these organic-rich sediments, which have continued to this day, typically reveal the presence of fine laminations undisturbed by bottom-dwelling fauna, indicating anoxic conditions on the sea floor, believed to be coincident with a low lying poisonous layer of hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; Furthermore, detailed organic [[geochemical]] studies have recently revealed the presence of molecules (so-called biomarkers) that derive from both [[purple sulfur bacteria]]&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; and [[green sulfur bacteria]]: organisms that required both light and free [[hydrogen sulfide|hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S)]], illustrating that anoxic conditions extended high into the illuminated upper water column.

There are currently several places on earth that are exhibiting the features of anoxic events on a localized scale such as algal/bacterial blooms and localized "dead zones". [[Dead zone (ecology)|Dead zones]] exist off the East Coast of the United States in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], in the Scandinavian strait [[Kattegat]], the [[Black Sea]] (which may have been anoxic in its deepest levels for millennia, however), in the northern Adriatic as well as a dead zone off the coast of Louisiana. The current{{When|date=May 2016}} surge of [[jellyfish]] worldwide is sometimes regarded as the first stirrings of an anoxic event{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Other marine dead zones have appeared in coastal waters of South America, China, Japan, and [[New Zealand]]. A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080814154325.htm]

This is a recent understanding. This picture was only pieced together during the last three decades{{When|date=May 2016}}. The handful of known and suspected anoxic events have been tied geologically to large-scale production of the world's oil reserves in worldwide bands of black [[shale]] in the [[geologic record]]. Likewise the high relative temperatures believed linked to so called "[[super-greenhouse event]]s".&lt;ref

===Euxinia===
{{See also|Phosphorus cycle}}
Oceanic '''anoxic events''' with [[Euxinia|euxinic]] (i.e. sulfidic) conditions have been linked to extreme episodes of volcanic outgassing. Thus, volcanism contributed to the buildup of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere, increased global temperatures, causing an accelerated hydrological cycle that introduced nutrients to the oceans to stimulate planktonic productivity. These processes potentially acted as a trigger for euxinia in restricted basins where water-column stratification could develop. Under anoxic to euxinic conditions, oceanic phosphate is not retained in sediment and could hence be released and recycled, aiding continued high productivity.&lt;ref name="Kump 2008" /&gt;

Temperatures throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous are generally thought to have been relatively warm, and consequently dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean were lower than today - making anoxia easier to achieve. However, more specific conditions are required to explain the short-period (less than a million years) oceanic anoxic events. Two hypotheses, and variations upon them, have proved most durable.

One hypothesis suggests that the anomalous accumulation of organic matter relates to its enhanced preservation under restricted and poorly oxygenated conditions, which themselves were a function of the particular geometry of the ocean basin: such a hypothesis, although readily applicable to the young and relatively narrow Cretaceous Atlantic (which could be likened to a large-scale Black Sea, only poorly connected to the World Ocean), fails to explain the occurrence of coeval black shales on open-ocean Pacific plateaus and shelf seas around the world.  There are suggestions, again from the Atlantic, that a shift in oceanic circulation was responsible, where warm, salty waters at low latitudes became hypersaline and sank to form an intermediate layer, at {{convert|500|to|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} depth, with a temperature of {{convert|20|C|F|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|25|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ngeo217"&gt;{{cite journal

|last5=Kuhnert|issue=7|bibcode=2008NatGe...1..453F
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second hypothesis suggests that oceanic anoxic events record a major change in the fertility of the oceans that resulted in an increase in organic-walled plankton (including bacteria) at the expense of calcareous plankton such as [[coccoliths]] and [[foraminifera]].
Such an accelerated flux of organic matter would have expanded and intensified the [[oxygen minimum zone]], further enhancing the amount of organic carbon entering the sedimentary record. Essentially this mechanism assumes a major increase in the availability of dissolved nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and possibly iron to the phytoplankton population living in the illuminated layers of the oceans.

For such an increase to occur would have required an accelerated influx of land-derived nutrients coupled with vigorous [[upwelling]], requiring major climate change on a global scale. Geochemical data from oxygen-[[isotope]] ratios in carbonate sediments and fossils, and magnesium/calcium ratios in fossils, indicate that all major oceanic anoxic events were associated with thermal maxima, making it likely that global weathering rates, and nutrient flux to the oceans, were increased during these intervals.  Indeed, the reduced solubility of oxygen would lead to phosphate release, further nourishing the ocean and fuelling high productivity, hence a high oxygen demand - sustaining the event through a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="10.1146.2Fannurev.earth.36.031207.124256"/&gt;

Here is another way of looking at oceanic anoxic events.  Assume that the earth releases a huge volume of carbon dioxide during an interval of intense volcanism; global temperatures rise due to the [[greenhouse effect]]; global weathering rates and fluvial nutrient flux increase; organic productivity in the oceans increases; organic-[[Carbon sequestration|carbon burial]] in the oceans increases (OAE begins); carbon dioxide is drawn down due to both burial of organic matter and weathering of silicate rocks (inverse greenhouse effect); global temperatures fall, and the ocean–atmosphere system returns to equilibrium (OAE ends).

In this way, an oceanic anoxic event can be viewed as the Earth’s response to the injection of excess carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and [[hydrosphere]].  One test of this notion is to look at the age of [[large igneous province]]s (LIPs), the extrusion of which would presumably have been accompanied by rapid effusion of vast quantities of volcanogenic gases such as carbon dioxide.  Intriguingly, the age of three LIPs ([[Karoo-Ferrar]] flood basalt, [[Caribbean large igneous province]], [[Ontong Java Plateau]]) correlates uncannily well with that of the major [[Jurassic]] (early [[Toarcian]]) and Cretaceous (early [[Aptian extinction|Aptian]] and [[Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event|Cenomanian–Turonian]]) oceanic anoxic events, indicating that a causal link is feasible.

==Occurrence==
Oceanic anoxic events most commonly occurred during periods of very warm [[climate]] characterized by high levels of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and mean surface temperatures probably in excess of {{Convert|25|°C}}. The [[Quaternary]] levels, the current [[period (geology)|period]], are just {{Convert|13|°C}} in comparison. Such rises in carbon dioxide may have been in response to a great outgassing of the highly flammable [[natural gas]] (methane) that some call an "oceanic burp".&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt;&lt;ref

|quote=With extreme weather continuing to bite -- hurricanes may increase in power by half a category above today’s top-level Category Five -- world food supplies will be critically endangered. :And: The Eocene greenhouse event fascinates scientists not just because of its effects, which also saw a major mass-extinction in the seas, but also because of its likely cause: [[methane hydrate]]s. This unlikely substance, a sort of ice-like combination of methane and water that is only stable at low temperatures and high pressure, may have burst into the atmosphere from the seabed in an immense '''“ocean burp”''', sparking a surge in global temperatures (methane is even more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide). Today vast amounts of these same methane hydrates still sit on sub-sea continental shelves. As the oceans warm, they could be released once more in a terrifying echo of that methane belch of 55 million years ago.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vast quantities of [[methane]] are normally locked into the Earth's crust on the continental plateaus in one of the many deposits consisting of compounds of [[methane hydrate]], a solid precipitated combination of methane and water much like ice. Because the methane hydrates are unstable, except at cool temperatures and high (deep) pressures, scientists have observed smaller "burps" due to [[tectonic]] events.  Studies suggest the huge release of natural gas&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; could be a major climatological trigger, methane itself being a [[greenhouse gas]] many times more powerful than carbon dioxide.  However, anoxia was also rife during the [[Hirnantian]] (late Ordovician) ice age.

Oceanic anoxic events have been recognized primarily from the already warm [[Cretaceous]] and [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Periods]], when numerous examples have been documented,&lt;ref name="Gronstal 2008"&gt;{{cite web

The [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] (PETM), which was characterized by a global rise in temperature and deposition of organic-rich shales in some shelf seas, shows many similarities to oceanic anoxic events.

Typically, oceanic anoxic events lasted for less than a million years, before a full recovery.

==Consequences==
Oceanic anoxic events have had many important consequences. It is believed that they have been responsible for mass [[extinction events|extinctions]] of marine organisms both in the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]].&lt;ref name="10.1146.2Fannurev.earth.36.031207.124256"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = K. M.| first2 = L.

  |bibcode = 2008AREPS..36..251M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Toarcian and [[Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event]]s correlate with the [[Toarcian turnover|Toarcian]] and [[Cenomanian-Turonian extinction event]]s of mostly marine life forms. Apart from possible atmospheric effects, many deeper-dwelling marine organisms could not adapt to an ocean where oxygen penetrated only the surface layers.

An economically significant consequence of oceanic anoxic events is the fact that the prevailing conditions in so many Mesozoic oceans has helped produce most of the world's [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves. During an oceanic anoxic event, the accumulation and preservation of organic matter was much greater than normal, allowing the generation of potential petroleum [[source rock]]s in many environments across the globe. Consequently, some 70 percent of oil source rocks are Mesozoic in age, and another 15 percent date from the warm Paleogene: only rarely in colder periods were conditions favorable for the production of source rocks on anything other than a local scale.

A model put forward by Lee Kump, Alexander Pavlov and Michael Arthur in 2005 suggests that oceanic anoxic events may have been characterized by upwelling of water rich in highly toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which was then released into the atmosphere. This phenomenon would probably have poisoned plants and animals and caused mass extinctions. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the hydrogen sulfide rose to the upper atmosphere and attacked the [[ozone layer]], which normally blocks the deadly [[ultraviolet radiation]] of the [[Sun]]. The increased UV radiation caused by this [[ozone depletion]] would have amplified the destruction of plant and animal life. Fossil spores from strata recording the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] show deformities consistent with UV radiation. This evidence, combined with fossil [[Bioindicator|biomarker]]s of [[green sulfur bacteria]], indicates that this process could have played a role in that [[mass extinction]] event, and possibly other extinction events. The trigger for these mass extinctions appears to be a warming of the ocean caused by a rise of carbon dioxide levels to about 1000 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Ocean chemistry effects===
Reduced oxygen levels are expected to lead to increased seawater concentrations of redox-sensitive metals. The reductive dissolution of [[iron]]–[[manganese]] oxyhydroxides in seafloor sediments under low-oxygen conditions would release those metals and associated trace metals. Sulfate reduction in such sediments could release other metals such as [[barium]]. When heavy-metal-rich anoxic deep water entered continental shelves and encountered increased O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, precipitation of some of the metals, as well as poisoning of the local biota, would have occurred. In the late Silurian mid-[[Silurian#Pridoli|Pridoli]] event, increases are seen in the Fe, Cu, As, Al, Pb, Ba, Mo and Mn levels in shallow-water sediment and microplankton; this is associated with a marked increase in the malformation rate in [[chitinozoan]]s and other microplankton types, likely due to metal toxicity.&lt;ref name="Vandenbroucke2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vandenbroucke|first1=T.

==Anoxic events in Earth's history==

===Cretaceous===
{{Main|Cretaceous}}
{{See also|Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event}}
Sulfidic (or euxinic) conditions, which exist today in many [[water bodies]] from [[pond]]s to various land-surrounded [[mediterranean sea]]s&lt;ref
 name="dicdef-1"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mediterranean definition of mediterranean sea]; "6. surrounded or nearly surrounded by land."&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Black Sea]], were particularly prevalent in the [[Cretaceous]] Atlantic but also characterized other parts of the world ocean. In an ice-free sea of these supposed super-greenhouse worlds, oceanic waters were as much as 200 meters higher, in some eras. During the time spans in question, the [[continental plate]]s are believed to have been well separated, and the [[mountain]]s we know today were (mostly) future [[tectonic]] events—meaning the overall landscapes were generally much lower— and even the half super-greenhouse climates would have been eras of highly expedited water erosion&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt;  carrying massive amounts of nutrients into the world oceans fueling an overall explosive population of microorganisms and their predator species in the oxygenated upper layers.

Detailed stratigraphic studies of Cretaceous black shales from many parts of the world have indicated that two oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) were particularly significant in terms of their impact on the chemistry of the oceans, one in the early [[Aptian]] (~120 Ma), sometimes called the [[Selli Event]] (or OAE 1a) &lt;ref name="oaedef"&gt;{{cite journal

* Insofar as the Cretaceous OAEs can be represented by type localities, it is the striking outcrops of laminated black shales within the vari-colored claystones and pink and white limestones near the town of Gubbio in the Italian [[Apennines]] that are the best candidates.
* The 1-meter thick black shale at the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary that crops out near Gubbio is termed the ‘Livello Bonarelli’ after the man who first described it in 1891.

More minor oceanic anoxic events have been proposed for other intervals in the Cretaceous (in the [[Valanginian]], [[Hauterivian]], [[Albian]] and [[Coniacian]]–[[Santonian]] stages), but their sedimentary record, as represented by organic-rich black shales, appears more parochial, being dominantly represented in the Atlantic and neighboring areas, and some researchers relate them to particular local conditions rather than being forced by global change.

===Jurassic===
{{Main|Jurassic}}
The only oceanic anoxic event documented from the Jurassic took place during the early [[Toarcian]] (~183 Ma).&lt;ref name="Gronstal 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2008"/&gt; Because no DSDP ([[Deep Sea Drilling Project]]) or ODP ([[Ocean Drilling Program]]) cores have recovered black shales of this age – there being little or no Toarcian ocean crust remaining in the world ocean – the samples of black shale primarily come from outcrops on land.  These outcrops, together with material from some commercial oil wells, are found on all major continents and this event seems similar in kind to the two major Cretaceous examples.

===Paleozoic===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
The boundary between the Ordovician and Silurian periods is marked by repetitive periods of anoxia, interspersed with normal, oxic conditions. In addition, anoxic periods are found during the Silurian.  These anoxic periods occurred at a time of low global temperatures (although {{co2}} levels were high), in the midst of a glaciation.&lt;ref name=Page2007&gt;{{palAss2007|author=Page, A. |author2=Zalasiewicz, J. |author3=Williams, M |last-author-amp=yes |title=Deglacial anoxia in a long-lived Early Palaeozoic Icehouse. |pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeppsson (1990) proposes a mechanism whereby the temperature of polar waters determines the site of formation of downwelling water.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the high latitude waters are below {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, they will be dense enough to sink; as they are cool, oxygen is highly soluble in their waters, and the deep ocean will be oxygenated.  If high latitude waters are warmer than {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, their density is too low for them to sink below the cooler deep waters.  Therefore, thermohaline circulation can only be driven by salt-increased density, which tends to form in warm waters where evaporation is high.  This warm water can dissolve less oxygen, and is produced in smaller quantities, producing a sluggish circulation with little deep water oxygen.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990/&gt;  The effect of this warm water propagates through the ocean, and reduces the amount of {{co2}} that the oceans can hold in solution, which makes the oceans release large quantities of {{co2}} into the atmosphere in a geologically short time (tens or thousands of years).&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;  The warm waters also initiate the [[Clathrate gun hypothesis|release of clathrates]], which further increases atmospheric temperature and basin anoxia.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;  Similar positive feedbacks operate during cold-pole episodes, amplifying their cooling effects.

The periods with cold poles are termed "P-episodes" (short for ''primo''&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and are characterised by [[Bioturbation|bioturbated]] deep oceans, a humid equator and higher weathering rates, and terminated by extinction events - for example, the [[Ireviken event|Ireviken]] and [[Lau event]]s.  The inverse is true for the warmer, oxic "S-episodes" (''secundo''), where deep ocean sediments are typically [[graptolit]]ic black shales.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990/&gt;
A typical cycle of ''secundo-primo'' episodes and ensuing ''event'' typically lasts around 3&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

The duration of events is so long compared to their onset because the positive feedbacks must be overwhelmed.  Carbon content in the ocean-atmosphere system is affected by changes in weathering rates, which in turn is dominantly controlled by rainfall. Because this is inversely related to temperature in Silurian times, carbon is gradually drawn down during warm (high {{co2}}) S-episodes, while the reverse is true during P-episodes.  On top of this gradual trend is overprinted the signal of [[Milankovic cycles]], which ultimately trigger the switch between P- and S- episodes.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

These events become longer during the Devonian; the enlarging land plant biota probably acted as a large buffer to carbon dioxide concentrations.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

The end-Ordovician Hirnantian event may alternatively be a result of algal blooms, caused by sudden supply of nutrients through wind-driven upwelling or an influx of nutrient-rich meltwater from melting glaciers, which by virtue of its fresh nature would also slow down oceanic circulation.&lt;ref name="Lüning2006"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archean and Proterozoic===
It has been thought that through most of Earth's history, oceans were largely oxygen-deficient. During the [[Archean]], euxinia was largely absent because of low availability of [[sulfate]] in the oceans,&lt;ref name="Kump 2008"/&gt; but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.

[[File:Smbat bagratunin tagadrum e artashesin.png|thumbnail|the coronation of the last [[Arshakuni Dynasty|Arshakuni]] king - [[Artaxias IV]], by Smbat III Bagratuni]]
The Bagratuni family became princes in the [[4th century]]. Their heritable rights were given to them by the [[Arshakuni Dynasty]], the kings of Armenia (52-428). They were called [[Aspet|aspets]] and crowned Arshakuni kings. Their domain included the region of [[İspir|Sper]] in [[Upper Armenia]], which was famous for its gold, and [[Tayk]].

Smbat I was the first member of the dynasty. He was aspet during the reign of Armenia's first Christian king, [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III the Great]] (287-330). The last Armenian king, who was crowned by Bagratunis, was [[Artaxias IV]] (423-428). The aspet was Smbat III, who was known from Vramshapuh king's times (389-415).

=== Persian and Byzantine occupation ===
{{main|Byzantine Armenia|Persian Armenia}}

The ancestors of Smbat III were the most famous princes (nakharars) during the occupation of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Sassanid Persia]]. Armenia had been divided between them since 387. Tirots, one of the ancestors of Smbat III, allied with Armenian marzbane. [[Sahak II Bagratuni|Sahak II]] and [[Smbat IV Bagratuni|Smbat IV]] were marzbans of Armenia. The rulers of the dynasty traditionally continued to be "aspets".

After the second division of Armenia, the domains of the Bagratuni family became part of [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Smbat IV Bagratuni|Smbat IV]] was among the princes who rebelled against them.

During the Arabic period (7-9th centuries), the Bagratuni family was one of the most powerful princely dynasties of Armenia. Their main competitors were [[sparapet]]s of the [[Mamikonian family]] who were Byzantine-oriented. Princes of Armenia were chosen from these two families and sometimes the people, who were under their influence. Princes were the second most powerful people after the [[ostikan]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The competition was ended by the victory of Bagratunis, who founded an independent kingdom. First, the title of Prince of Armenia changed to Prince of Princes. Then, the prince of princes became [[Sparapet|sparapets]] who were the constables of the army. In the beginning of the 9th century, a powerful prince, [[Ashot Msaker]], united [[Turuberan|Taron]], [[Tayk]] and [[Ayrarat]], taking them under his control and thus making them part of his domain. Later, he united [[Moxoene]], [[Gugark]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Caucasian Albania]]. He then took over [[Artsruni]]s of [[Vaspurakan]] and [[Siunia dynasty|Syunis]] of [[Syunik (historic province)|Syunik]]. As a result, all of Arminiya came under his control.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Princes of Armenia and sparapets were from the family of Smbat VIII. His son, [[Ashot I of Armenia|Ashot]], became the king of Armenia. Sons of Bagarat II, brother of Smbat VIII, became the princes of Taron. Their sister, Hripsime, became the princess of principality of Vaspurakan. Her husband was the first prince Hamazasp II, Artsruni.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Before independence, the Tayk of Bagratuni became an independent [[Tao-Klarjeti|principality]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Its ruler, [[Ashot I of Iberia|Ashot]], became the head of the Georgian [[Bagrationi dynasty]]. It ruled in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] for one thousand years (9-19th centuries).

The last prince of Armenia was [[Ashot I of Armenia|Ashot]] (855-885), son of Smbat VIII, who later became the first king (885-890).

=== Bagratunis of Taron ===
[[File:David of Sasoon.jpg|thumbnail|200px|[[Sasuntzi Davith]], the hero of Armenian epic poetry. According to one version, [[Ashot II of Taron|Ashot II]] and [[David Arkayik]] are the personages of creating him]]
Taron ([[Turuberan]]) became a part of [[Bagratuni dynasty|Bagratunis]]' domain in the beginning of the 9th century, when [[Ashot Msaker]] was Prince of Armenia (790-826). As a prince of Taron, he is counted as Ashot I (804-826). After his death, prince of princes, [[Bagrat II Bagratuni|Bagrat]], inherited Taron, the south of the domain, and Smbat, [[Ayrarat]], which was the northern part. Bagrat was the second in the dynasty. Bagrat I was an [[aspet]] in the 4th century. However, in Taron, he was the first Bagrat, so he ruled as Bagrat I of Taron (826-851), because there were no Bagrats before him. His sons and grandsons ruled until 966. After, Taron became a part of [[Byzantine Empire]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Previous seniors, princes of Taron, of the [[Mamikonian]] family, were strong in the region, even during the ruling of the last prince, Ashot III. They became relatives with the Bagratunis, and as a result of that, there were two more princes in Taron in his last days. They were Bagrat III and Grigor II, who were half-Mamikonians and half-Bagratunis. Later, the Tronite branch of the Bagratunis and Mamikonians became one family. Some of them ruled in [[Sasun]] (Tornikians) and the others in [[Moush]] ([[Taronites]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Kings of Armenia ===

After the death of [[Ashot Msaker]] (826) and [[Bagrat II Bagratuni|Bagrat II]] Bagratuni (851), Smbat VIII became the prince of Armenia. His family was the ruling royal family for 200 years, in [[Bagratid Armenia|Armenia]], [[Kingdom of Iberia|Georgia]] and [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]]. Because of this long rule, they were called king of kings (shahnshah).
[[File:Bagratuni flag.svg|thumbnail|flag, [[Bagratuni dynasty|Bagratuni]] dynasty|300px]]
The son of Smbat VIII, [[Ashot I of Armenia|Ashot]], became the first Bagratuni king. He had four sons and three daughters, whom he married to Artsruni and Syuni princes. Thus, the strongest families of Armenia became one family and began to rule the country. Ashot's brother, Shapuh, became sparapet, the constable of the Armenian army. The capital was Bagaran, which was throne-city of [[Ashot Msaker]] (790-826). [[Ashot II of Armenia|Ashot]] 's son, [[Smbat I of Armenia|Smbat]] (890-914), moved the capital to [[Shirakavan (ancient city)|Yerazgavors]]. It was the capital for about forty years until King Abas moved it to [[Kars]].

[[Ashot III the Merciful]], king of Armenia (953-977), built a new capital around the fortress of [[Ani]]. It was the last capital of the Armenian kingdom, so it is also called Kingdom of Ani. His brother, Mushegh, stayed in Kars and founded Kingdom of Kars (963-1065) under the sovereignty of Ashot III. Later, the king of Armenia, Smbat II, allowed his brother [[Gurgen I of Lori|Gurgen]] to organize a new kingdom in north which became the [[Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget]] (978-1113). Smbat Syuni did the same in the east creating the [[Kingdom of Syunik-Baghk]].

The third son of Ashot III, [[Gagik I of Armenia|Gagik]], was the last powerful king of Armenia (990-1020). After his death, the kingdom was divided into two parts, between the brothers, [[Hovhannes-Smbat]] and [[Ashot IV|Ashot]]. The last king was [[Gagik II of Armenia|Gagik II]] (1042-1045), son of Ashot.

In 1079, Gagik II was killed. In 1080, Gagik of Kars and his sons, Hovhannes and David, also died. The son of Hovhannes, Ashot, was also killed in Ani. As a result, the royal branch of the Bagratunis ended with Ani and Kars. The last royal branch,  the Kiurikian family, remained in Lori.

Armenian prince Ruben killed the murderers of Gagik II and inherited the throne from him. In 1080, he founded the Armenian principality of Cilicia (1080-1198), which became a [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|kingdom]] (1198-1375).

Consequently, the royal heritage of the Armenian Bagratuni family is either Georgian [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagrationis]], or [[Rubinian dynasty|Rubinians]], [[Hetumids]] and [[House of Lusignan|Lusignans]] in Cilicia, or the Kiurikians. Non-royal or princely branches have many more than these three royal branches.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}{{OR|date=August 2015}}

=== Kiurikians ===
[[File:Bagrotouni.jpg|thumbnail|coat of arms, [[Bagratuni dynasty|Bagratuni]] dynasty|300px]]
The [[Kiurikian family|Kiurikian]]s were a royal and princely family from Armenia from the 10th through 14th centuries. The founder is Gurgen or Kiurike, son of [[Ashot III the Merciful]] (953-977). At first, they ruled only in [[Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget|Tashir-Dzoraget]] ([[Lori Province]]) but later in [[Tavush Province|Tavush]] as well. Grandsons of Gurgen-Kiurike were kings of Tashir-Dzoraget and eastern Georgia ([[Kingdom of Kakheti]]).

In the 12th century, Kakhety and Lori annexed to Georgia. The Kiurikians remained in Tavush. Later they divided into Matsnaberd and Nor-berd branches. The last prince, Sargis of Matsnaberd, ruled in the 13th century. Nothing is known about him, his parents (probably Aghsartan), or their offspring.

The '''Barada''' ({{lang-ar|بردى}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''Baradá'') is the main river of [[Damascus]], the capital city of [[Syria]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Barada River, Damascus, Syria.jpg|thumb|left|Barada river near the [[Citadel of Damascus]], 2006]]
"Barada" is thought to be derived from the word ''barid'', which means "cold" in [[Semitic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rihani |first=Ameen |date=2016 |title=The Book of Khalid: A Critical Edition |url= |location= |publisher=Syracuse University Press |page=455 |isbn=0815653328 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek name ({{lang-el|Χρυσορρόας|Chrysorrhoas}}, means "streaming with gold").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kraeling |first=Emil G. H. |date=2008 |title=Aram and Israel: The Aramaeans in Syria and Mesopotamia |url= |location= |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |page=46 |isbn=1606083945 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topography and source==
Throughout the arid plateau region east of Damascus, oases, streams, and a few minor rivers that empty into swamps and small lakes provide water for local irrigation. Most important of these is the Barada, a river that rises in the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]] and disappears into the desert. The Barada flows out of the [[karst spring]] of [[Ain al-Fijah]], about {{convert|27|km|mi}} north west of Damascus in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, but its true source is Lake Barada, a small lake that is also a karst spring located about {{convert|8|km|mi}} from [[Zabadani]]. The Barada descends through a steep, narrow [[Canyon|gorge]] named "Rabwe" before it arrives at Damascus, where it divides into seven branches that irrigate the [[Ghouta|Al Ghutah]] (الغوطة) oasis, the location of Damascus. Eventually the Ghouta reached a size of 370 square kilometers, although in the 1980s, urban growth started replacing agricultural use with housing and industry.&lt;ref name=countrystudy&gt;{{cite book |title=Syria: a country study |url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/sytoc.html#sy0030 |chapter=Land, Water, and Climate |editor-first=Thomas |editor-last=Collelo |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |date=1988 |lccn=87600488}} Note: text doesn't have permanent URL. Click "Land, Water, and Climate" at link.&lt;/ref&gt; The river has also suffered from severe drought in the last decades, mainly due to the lower rainfall rates and the large increase in the population in the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alhayat.com/Articles/21639937/النظام-في-وادي-بردى--النهب-المستمر----تعفيش-وتحريق-وتنحيس&lt;/ref&gt; It also suffers from serious pollution problems, especially in the summer, where there is almost no flow and little water in the basin.

==Biblical mention==
Barada is identified as '''Abana''' (or ''Amanah'', in [[Qere and Ketiv]] variation in [[Tanakh]] and classical [[Chrysorrhoas]]) which is the more important of the two rivers of [[Damascus, Syria]] and was mentioned in the ''[[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]]'' ([[s:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#5:12|2 Kings 5:12]]). As the Barada rises in the [[Anti-Libanus]], and escapes from the mountains through a narrow gorge, its waters [[debouch]] fan-like, in canals or ''rivers'', the name of one of which, the [[Banias]] river, retains a trace of ''Abana''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=6}}

[[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]], who gives a description of them in his book ''Rob Roy on the Jordan'', affirmed that as a work of [[hydraulic engineering]], the system and construction of the canals, by which the Abana and Pharpar were used for irrigation, might be considered as one of the most complete and extensive in the world. In the [[Bible]], [[Naaman]] exclaims that the Abana and [[Pharpar]] are greater than all the waters of [[Land of Israel|Israel]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=6}}

The '''Bentinck family''' is a prominent family belonging to both [[Dutch nobility|Dutch]] and [[British nobility]]. Its members have served in the armed forces and as ambassadors and politicians, including [[Governor General of India]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. The family is related to the [[British Royal Family]] via [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]]'s maternal [[Cavendish-Bentinck]] line.

==History==
The name Bentinck is a [[patronymic]] variation of the [[Old Germanic]] name Bento.  The family is originally from the East of the [[Netherlands]], and is regarded as ''[[Uradel]]'' noble, or noble from earliest times. The oldest known ancestor is Johan Bentinck, who is mentioned in documents between 1343 and 1386 and owned land near [[Heerde]].

An important British branch was founded by [[Hans Willem Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland]] who accompanied [[William III of England|William Henry, Prince of Orange]] to England during the [[Glorious Revolution]]. The head of this line was initially given the title of [[Earl of Portland]], later [[Duke of Portland]]. 

In 1732 the title Graf (Count) Bentinck, of the Holy Roman Empire, was created for William Bentinck, son of the 1st Earl of Portland. A Royal Licence of 1886 was created which allowed the use of this title in England. The Royal Warrant of 27 April 1932 abolished the use of Foreign Titles in the United Kingdom, but extended the special allowance in 13 cases, including the Bentinck countly title "during the lives of the present holders, their heirs, and their heir's heir, provided such heir's heir is now in existence." That exception has now expired.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/TNA/HO_45_25906.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Another branch with the title Count existed in the Netherlands, but died out in the male line. 

The Dutch and British branches of the family continue to exist and belong to both the [[Dutch nobility]] and [[British nobility]].

==Today==
The Dutch estate of the Bentinck family since the 16th century, [[:nl:Havezate Schoonheten|Schoonheten House]], is situated between the villages [[Heeten]] and [[Raalte]] in [[Overijssel]]. The area contains 5 square kilometres of forests and cultivated land. Nowadays, the family mainly earns its living by forestry, agriculture and renting holiday houses. The British branch of the family owns '''[[Bothal Castle]]''' (Bothal Estates) in Northumberland and '''[[Welbeck Abbey]]''' (Welbeck Estates), the ancestral seat of the [[Dukes of Portland]] in Nottinghamshire.

*[[North Bentinck Arm|North]] and [[South Bentinck Arm]]s, inlets off [[Burke Channel]], were named after [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland]] by [[George Vancouver|Captain Vancouver]] in 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Walbran |first=Captain John T. |title=British Columbia Place Names, Their Origin and History |place=Vancouver/Toronto |url= http://www.nosracines.ca/e/toc.aspx?id=3545|publisher =Douglas &amp; McIntyre |year=1971 |edition=Facsimile reprint of 1909 |isbn=0-88894-143-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}} [[North Bentinck Arm]] is significant in the history of Canada because it was here in 1793 that [[Sir Alexander Mackenzie]] completed the first recorded transcontinental crossing of North America by a European north of Mexico.

'''Charles Rostaing''' (9 October 1904 –  24 April  1999) was a French [[linguist]] who specialised in [[toponymy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicacions.iec.cat/repository/pdf/00000011/00000040.pdf Obituary] by Jean-Claude Bouvier {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Signature de Charles Rostaing.jpg|thumb|Signature of Charles Rostaing (1904-1999) on 13 December 1984.]]

Charles Rostaing was one of the most famous specialists in French place names in general and Provence in particular of the 20th century. He was also the grandfather of the biographer Alain Wodrascka.

After his higher studies from 1923 to 1926 in [[Aix-en-Provence]] where he was a pupil of Georges Lote and  Emile Ripert, he obtained his [[Agrégation]] in grammar in 1928. He was a high school teacher in [[Alès]], [[Toulon]], and [[Nice]] then in Paris from 1934 to 1946. Just before the defence of his thesis he entered higher education in October 1946 as a lecturer in the language and literature of [[Provence]] in the Faculty of Arts of Aix-en-Provence.

In the following year after defending  his thesis, he became a senior lecturer and then Professor of classic French language and literature in 1948 before succeeding Auguste Brun, in 1952, to the Chair of Romance languages - a post he held until his departure for the [[Sorbonne]] in 1967. He was director of the ''Centre for Education and Research for [[Occitan]]'' from 1967 to 1974.

Majoral of [[Félibrige]] in 1952, he became the ninth ''capoulié'' (president) from 1956 to 1962.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5432">The '''Committee for Geographical Names in Australia (CGNA)''' was formed in [[Perth, Western Australia]] in 1984 following the '''International Cartographic Association Conference'''. The committee was created from that meeting of the various [[Australia]]n and [[New Zealand]] geographical names committees and authorities attending the conference.

The Committee (CGNA) was then integrated within the '''Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping (ICSM)''' in 1993. It is also associated with the '''Geospatial and Earth Monitoring Division''' of [[Geoscience Australia]].

==Annual meetings==

[[File:Dehesa Boyal. Bollullos Par del Condado (Huelva).jpg|thumb|300px|right|A dehesa in [[Bollullos Par del Condado]], [[Huelva (province)|Huelva]], southern Spain]]

A '''''dehesa''''' is a multifunctional, agrosylvopastoral system (a type of [[agroforestry]]) and cultural landscape of southern and central Spain and southern Portugal; in Portugal, it is known as a '''''montado'''''. It's name comes from the Latin 'defesa', (fenced), referring to land that was fenced, and usually destined for pasture.&lt;ref&gt;Fra. Paleo (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Dehesas may be private or communal property (usually belonging to the municipality). Used primarily for grazing, they produce a variety of products, including [[non-timber forest product]]s such as [[wild game]], [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], [[honey]], [[Cork (material)|cork]], and [[firewood]]. They are also used to raise the [[Spanish fighting bull]] and the [[Iberian pig]]. The main tree component is oaks, usually holm (''[[Quercus ilex]]'') and cork (''[[Quercus suber]]''). Other oaks, including melojo (''[[Quercus pyrenaica]]'') and quejigo (''[[Quercus faginea]]''), may be used to form dehesa, the species depending on geographical location and elevation. Dehesa is an anthropogenic system that provides not only a variety of foods, but also wildlife habitat for endangered species such as the [[Spanish imperial eagle]].&lt;ref&gt;Joffre et al. (1999); Huntsinger et al. (2004); McGrath (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 

By extension, the term can also be used for this style of [[rangeland management]] on estates.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Nature==

The dehesa is derived from the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub|Mediterranean forest ecosystem]], consisting of grassland featuring herbaceous species, used for grazing cattle, goats, and sheep, and tree species belonging to the genus ''Quercus'' ([[oak]]), such as the holm oak (''Quercus ilex'' sp. ''ballota''), although other tree species such as [[beech]] and [[pine trees]] may also be present. Oaks are protected and pruned to produce [[acorn]]s, which the famous [[black Iberian pig]]s feed on in the fall during the ''montanera''.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Ham produced from Iberian pigs fattened with acorns and air-dried at high elevations is known as ''[[Jamón ibérico]]'' ("[[presunto ibérico]]", or "pata negra" in Portuguese), and sells for premium prices, especially if only acorns have been used for fattening.

In a typical dehesa, oaks are managed to persist for about 250 years.  If cork oaks are present, the cork is harvested about every 9 to 12 years, depending on the productivity of the site. The understory is usually cleared every 7 to 10 years to prevent the takeover of the woodland by shrubs of the rock rose family ([[Cistaceae]]), often referred to as "''jara''", or by oak sprouts. Oaks are spaced to maximize overall productivity by balancing light for the grasses in the understory, water use in the soils, and acorn production for pigs and game.&lt;ref&gt;Joffre et al. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dehesa2.jpg|thumb|right|Dehesa in [[Extremadura]], Spain]]There is debate about the origins and maintenance of the dehesa, and whether or not the oaks can reproduce adequately under the grazing densities now prevailing.{{cn|date=April 2018}} [[Image:dehesa cabaneros.jpg|thumb|A dehesa in the [[Montes de Toledo]].]]

==Importance and economic context==

The dehesa system has great economic and social importance on the Iberian Peninsula because of both the large amount of land involved and its importance in maintaining rural population levels. The major source of income for dehesa owners is usually cork, a sustainable product that supports this ancient production system and old growth oaks.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; High end black iberian pigs and sale of hunting rights also represent significant income sources. Periodic hunts in the dehesa are known as the ''monteria''. Groups attend a hunt at a private estate and wait at hunting spots for game to be driven to them with dogs. They usually pay well for the privilege, hunting [[wild boar]], [[red deer]] and other species.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The area of dehesa usually coincides with areas that could be termed "marginal" because of both their limited agricultural potential (due to the poor quality of the soil) and a lack of local industry, which results in isolated agro-industries and very low capitalization.

== Extent ==

Dehesa covers nearly 20,000 square kilometers on the [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian Peninsula]], mainly in:

'''Feofan Farneevich Davitaia''' ({{lang-ka|თეოფანე ფარნას ძე დავითაია;}} born 2 (15) September 1911, village Eki, now [[Senaki Municipality]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] — died 29 July 1979, [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) was a Georgian [[geographer]], [[climatologist]] and [[agrometeorologist]]. doctor of agricultural sciences (1951), [[academician]] of the [[Georgian National Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the Georgian SSR]] (1960), Honored Scientist of the Georgian SSR (1966). Became a member of the [[CPSU]] in 1939. Davitaia was [[professor]] of the [[Saint Petersburg State University|universities of Leningrad]] (1950–1951) and [[Moscow State University|Moscow]] (1955–1961). In [[Moscow]], for several years he also delivered lectures at the Courses for the improvement of professional skill at the Central Board of Hydrometeorological Service, [[USSR Council of Ministers]].&lt;ref name="biblio"&gt;{{Cite book |last1= [[Mikhail Budyko]] |first1= |last2=Goltsberg |first2=i.|last3= |first3= |title=''Feofan Davitaia'' (1911—1979), Bibliography, |year= 1984 |publisher= Mecniereba |location=Tbilisi  |isbn= | pages=21–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1963 Davitaia continued educational work at [[Tbilisi State University]], directing a large number of postgraduates who successfully developed his ideas in their research.&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt;

For 15 years Davitaia was a member of the Scientific and Technological Council of the USSR Ministry of Agriculture; he took an active part in the work of the State Commission for the strain testing of agricultural crops on the territory of our vast country. He participated in the preparation of the many-volume fundamental edition "Ampelography of the USSR".&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt;

==Biography==
Feofan Davitaia was born on 15 September 1911 in the mountainous village of Eki, [[Tskhakaia district]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], where he went to elementary school. From 1909 Davitaia's father worked in [[Poti]] as a stevedore. Later his large family also moved to [[Poti]].&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt;

In 1927 Feofan Davitaia finished secondary school in [[Poti]], and on the recommendation of the town YCL Committee was given the job of loader of manganese ore at the [[Poti Sea Port|Poti port]]. After entering [[Tbilisi State University|Tbilisi University]] in 1928, Davitaia combined his study with work at the Weather Bureau of the [[Tbilisi Geophysical Observatory]]. While a postgraduate student, Davitaia came out with a number of initiative suggestions on the organization of scientific work. Of these, mention should be made of his well-founded suggestion-published In the [[Izvestia]] newspaper—on the setting up of a Scientific Committee attached to the [[Government of the USSR]].&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt; 
  
In 1936 Davitaia successfully defended his thesis for a candidate’s degree on the "Climatic Zones of the Vine in the USSR", which was published as a monograph in 1938.&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt;

By 1950 Davitaia summed up his research in his monograph "Study of the Climates of the Vine in the USSR and the Bases of their Practical Use", which he defended brilliantly as a doctoral thesis In agricultural sciences. The monograph, published in 1952, has become a deskbook of viticulturists, winemakers, and agriclimatologists.&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt;

In 1964-1965 Davitaia worked at the [[Academy of Sciences of Cuba]] directing a group of Soviet consulting scientists engaged in a study of the country’s natural resources. Jointly with Soviet and Cuban scientists, he conducted extensive work for the preparation of a national atlas of Cuba. As a result of processing the materials of long-term meteorological observations Davitaia wrote a scientific monograph, "Climatic Resources of Cuba", which was published (jointly with I. I. Trusov) in Spanish ([[Havana]], 1965). A somewhat modified version of that monograph was published in [[Tbilisi]] in Russian (1966). This book was highly appraised in a number of published reviews, including one in the United States. To mark this important event in the scientific life of the Republic of Cuba, in 1965 the Cuban Academy of Sciences conferred on Davitaia the title of cofounder of the Institute of Geography in Havana, presenting him with a diploma. Davitaia’s Scientific missions abroad were combined with geographical excursion-expeditions. Among them particularly fruitful in the scientific respect were his travels in [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]], the United States, Ireland, and the [[PRC]]. The results of those travels were used in developing the climatic criteria for the identification.&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt;

In 1967-1968, at the invitation of the [[University of Wisconsin]], Davitaia delivered a course of lectures on contemporary problems of climatology and agrometeorology for the postgraduates and professors of the Department of Geography.&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt;

During his stay in the USA Davitaia published papers in American scientific journals; his monograph, "Methods of Agricultural Assessment of Climate", was published in the same period.&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt;

The numerous articles and papers contributed by Davitaia to newspapers and popular magazines reflected the achievements of Soviet [[agrometeorology]] and [[geography]], making this evidence available to broad sections of the public. In 1972, at the 22nd World Geographical Congress (Canada), Feofan Davitaia was elected [[Vice-President]] of the [[International Geographical Union]].&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt;

At the 1976 International Congress in Moscow Davitaia was again elected to this high post. At that Congress he directed the work of the section of [[climatology]], [[hydrology]], [[glaciology]], and [[oceanography]].&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15080">The '''Fish Hoek Valley''' is situated in the [[Cape Peninsula]], eighteen miles south of [[Cape Town]], South Africa.  It takes its name from the town of [[Fish Hoek]] on the False Bay coast.

The valley is bound by mountains (including Chapman's Peak, Spitskop, Silvermine Mountain, and Ridge Peak) on the north;  Fish Hoek Bay and [[False Bay]] on the east;  mountains (including Elsie's Peak, Rooikrans, and Slangkop) on the south;  and Chapman's Bay and the Atlantic Ocean on the west.  It is 13 kilometres from west to east, and between 3 and 6 kilometres from north to south.  The valley has several rivers and lakes.

The predominant vegetation type in this valley is [[endangered]] [[Hangklip Sand Fynbos]]. However, the sides of the valley are home to [[Peninsula Granite Fynbos|Cape Granite Fynbos]], and [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]] can be found higher up on the surrounding mountains. The latter two vegetation types (also both endangered) are endemic to the [[Cape Peninsula]] and can be found nowhere else in the world. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Pages/BrochuresBooklets.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223125053/http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Pages/Brochuresbooklets.aspx |archivedate=2012-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish Hoek Valley was once rural, but today it is largely covered by suburbs and townships such as [[Kommetjie]], [[Ocean View, Cape Town|Ocean View]], [[Noordhoek, Cape Town|Noordhoek]], The Lakes, [[Masiphumelele]], [[Capri Village]], [[Sunnydale]], Sun Valley, Fish Hoek, and [[Clovelly]].  Some rural aspects have been preserved in the form of heritage areas and parts of the [[Table Mountain National Park]].

==History==

'''Pre-historic'''

Many millennia ago, the valley was a channel separating two islands off the African mainland. By 20 000 years ago, the sea had receded, the channel and the isthmus separating the islands from the mainland had become dry land, and the islands had become a peninsula.&lt;ref name=htc&gt;MacPhee, D. &amp; De Wit, M. (2003) ''How the Cape Got its Shape''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 10 000 BCE, pre-Bushman people were living in caves in the slopes lining the valley.  Several of their skeletons, weapons and other artefacts were unearthed in Peers Cave on the north-eastern side of the valley, in 1927.  The skeletons were named '[[Fish Hoek Man]]'.

By the first century AD 'Strandlopers' ([[Khoisan]]) were living on the slopes of Slangkop.  A midden containing mussel, limpet and abalone shells, and various stone implements was uncovered there in 1972.&lt;ref name=kcp&gt;Midgley, J.F. (1984).  ''Kommetjie CP - Its Story''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''17th century'''

The recorded history of the valley, and of South Africa as a whole, begins when the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a settlement at [[Table Bay]], 28 kilometres north of the valley, in 1652.  The Company regarded the whole of the [[Western Cape]] region as being under its jurisdiction, but in the early years its settlement remained confined to the northern peninsula.  Its first venture into the southern peninsula is thought to have been in 1659, when troops combed the area in search of KhoiSan who had attacked the Company's settlement.  

In the early 1680s, the Company explored the mountains on the northern side of the valley for silver deposits.  The mountain, and a river which flows down it, became known as 'Zilvermyn'.  In 1687, Governor [[Simon van der Stel]] explored the area, and reported an abundance of wild birds and wild game roaming the area.&lt;ref name=fbs&gt;Burman, J. (1977).  ''The False Bay Story''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Three years later, Van der Stel granted fishing and whaling rights at Visch Hoek on the eastern end of the valley &amp;mdash; a community of fishermen and whalers developed there, and a building was erected. 

'''18th century'''

Permanent settlement of the valley began in 1743, when the Company established Simon's Bay, 3 kilometres south of Visch Hoek bay, as a winter anchorage.  Governor-general [[Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff|Gustav van Imhoff]] granted three farms at the western end of the valley, probably to supply fesh produce to Simon's Bay.  They were ''Slangkop'' ('Snake Peak'), ''De Goede Hoop'' ('Good Hope'), and ''Poespaskraal'' ('Hotch-potch kraal').  Half a century later, in 1797, when the colony was under British military occupation, a fourth farm was established, at Visch Hoek, but it was only on loan and the lease ended when the lessee died in 1808. 

'''19th century'''

When the Cape became a permanent British colony in 1814, the Royal Navy established a permanent base at Simon's Town, and governor [[John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden|Sir John Cradock]] established the southern part of the Peninsula as the Simon's Town magisterial district.  The road through Visch Hoek to Simon's Town was rebuilt in 1815.

Soon afterwards, two more farms were established, at the eastern end of the valley.  In 1815, Governor [[Lord Charles Somerset]] granted a 112-hectare farm on the slopes of the Zilvermyn mountain - appropriately, the farm was named ''Zilvermyn''.  In 1818, Somerset granted the 1528-hectare ''Visch Hoek'' property as a farm, on condition that the owner was not allowed to sell liquor.  When Visch Hoek was subdivided in 1827, the 454-hectare portion north of the Zilvermyn river became a separate farm named ''Klein Tuin'' ('small garden').

Later, a farm named ''Brakkloof'' (or ''Brakke Kloof'') was granted between Visch Hoek and Poespaskraal.

Farm names were changed from time to time.  Slangkop also became known as 'Imhoff's Gift', De Goede Hoop as 'Noordhoek', and Poespaskraal as 'Sunnydale'.

In 1855, a divisional council (comparable to a [[county council]] in England) was established to administer the Cape Division, i.e. the rural areas surrounding Cape Town.  It administered the valley for the following 131 years, except during the years 1879 to 1888, when the Simon's Town magisterial district was a division with its own divisional council.  

Another farm was created in the late 1850s, when Slangkop / Imhoff's Gift was subdivided and the south-eastern portion became ''Ocean View''.&lt;ref name="kcp"/&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, the south peninsula was well established.  The railway line was extended from the seaside town of [[Kalk Bay]] through Visch Hoek to [[Simon's Town]] in 1890.  When Kalk Bay was proclaimed a municipality in 1895, the farm Klein Tuin was included within its boundaries.

'''20th century'''

Like the rest of the colony, the Simon's Town district was under martial law during 1901 and 1902, because of the [[Anglo-Boer War]], the invasion of the British of the Boer countries to the North. The Transvaal and Free State.

The first townships were established in the valley towards the end of the war.  Kommetje Estates Ltd bought Slangkop farm in 1900 and established a seaside village named Kommetje.  At the other end of the valley, G.W. MacIntyre bought Klein Tuin in 1902, renamed it 'Mayville', and established a small seaside suburb (which was later renamed '[[Clovelly]]').  

Parliament approved the construction of a branch railway line from Visch Hoek to Kommetje,&lt;ref name=kra&gt;Act 14 of 1903 (Cape Colony)&lt;/ref&gt; but it was never built.  Eventually, ten years later, in 1913, the divisional council built Kommetje Road (now route M65), leading from Visch Hoek across the southern side of the valley, to Kommetje.

The Kalk Bay municipality, including Mayville (Clovelly), was incorporated into the City of Cape Town in 1913, but the rest of the valley remained under the divisional council.

During World War I, the Simon's Town district was under martial law to protect the naval base, and travel through the valley was hampered by military roadblocks.  The German navy cruiser ''[[SMS Möwe (auxiliary cruiser)|M&amp;#246;we]]'' was seen in Chapman's Bay, off Slangkop, in 1916.&lt;ref name="kcp"/&gt;

Two more townships were developed after the war.  Visch Hoek (or '[[Fish Hoek]]') farm was subdivided into a township in 1918, and grew rapidly.  A local board was established in 1921, and a village management board in 1927.  The prohibition against the sale of liquor imposed a century earlier still held good, and the town became well known for being the only 'dry' town in the country.

Part of Noordhoek was subdivided for residential development in 1920.&lt;ref name=dcc&gt;Annual Report of the Divisional Council of the Cape&lt;/ref&gt;  Access to the western end of the valley was improved when the divisional council opened Chapman's Peak Drive (now part of route M6) in 1922, as part of a scenic motor route around the Peninsula.&lt;ref name="dcc"/&gt;  

Cape Estates Ltd bought the undeveloped part of Mayville in 1922, and established the Clovelly Country Club.

Fish Hoek was proclaimed a municipality in 1940.

German submarines were active in Cape waters during World War II.  A military radar station was established on Slangkop, to monitor the ocean, and a small military camp named 'Cobra' was opened to house the personnel.  Two German anti-ship mines washed up at Kommetjie &amp;mdash; the navy dismantled one and detonated the other.&lt;ref name="kcp"/&gt;

After the war, most of Sunnydale farm was subdivided into a residential township.

The divisional council undertook considerable development in the valley during the 1960s and 1970s.  In the 1960s, it developed a White residential township, named [[Sun Valley, Cape Town|Sun Valley]], on Brakkloof farm.,&lt;ref name="dcc"/&gt; and a Coloured township on [[Ocean View, Cape Town|Ocean View]] farm, to accommodate the communities which the government had forced to move out of Fish Hoek, Sunnydale, and Simon's Town under its [[apartheid]] system.  In 1968, the council opened the '[[Ou Kaapse Weg]]' ('Old Cape Road') (now route M64), leading from Sunnydale over the Silvermine mountain to [[Tokai, Cape Town|Tokai]].&lt;ref name="dcc"/&gt;  

In the 1970s, the council opened Soetwater caravan park (for Coloured holidaymakers), and Imhoff caravan park (for Whites) near Kommetjie.&lt;ref name="dcc"/&gt;  Wildevoëlvlei sewage works were opened in 1977&lt;ref name="dcc"/&gt;

Part of Sunnydale was developed into a residential township named ''[[Capri Village]]''.

The divisional council was absorbed into the Western Cape Regional Services Council in 1986.  

In 1986, the Black residents of Dassenberg were forcibly evicted under the apartheid laws and re-settled at [[Khayalitsha]].  They were allowed to return to the valley in 1989, and a new settlement was established for them on part of Sunnydale &amp;mdash; it was later named [[Masiphumelele]] ('we will succeed').&lt;ref name=rev&gt;Cole, J.  'Revolt a symptom of historical pain' in ''Cape Argus'' (8 August 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Apartheid ended in 1994.

In 1996, the valley was incorporated into the new [[South Peninsula Municipality]], and Fish Hoek's municipality was dissolved.  Four years later, the South Peninsula Municipality was incorporated into the City of Cape Town, which now administers the valley.

Frisia is the traditional [[homeland]] of the [[Frisians]], a Germanic people that speaks [[Frisian languages]], which together with [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] form the [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian language group]].

When the [[French people|French]] occupied the Netherlands, the name for the Frisian department was {{lang|fr|[[Frise (department)|Frise]]}}. In [[English language|English]], both terms, Frisia and Friesland are used.

== Divisions ==
Frisia is commonly divided into three sections:

#'''[[West Frisia]]''' in the Netherlands corresponds roughly to:
#* the province of [[Friesland]]
#* the province of [[Groningen province|Groningen]]
#* the northern parts of the province of [[North Holland]], historical [[West Friesland (historical region)|West Friesland]]
#'''[[East Frisia]]''' in [[Lower Saxony]], Germany corresponds roughly to:
#* East Frisia in a more narrow sense:
#** the [[Aurich (district)|Aurich district]] 
#** the [[Emden|Emden district]]
#** the [[Leer (district)|Leer district]] 
#** the [[Wittmund (district)|Wittmund district]] 
#* East Frisia in a wider sense ([[East Frisian peninsula]]):
#** the [[Friesland (district)|Friesland district]] 
#** the [[Wilhelmshaven|Wilhelmshaven district]]
#** the [[Saterland| Saterland municipality]]
#** the [[Butjadingen]] peninsula, historical [[Rüstringen]]
#** the [[Wurster Nordseeküste|Wurster Nordseeküste municipality]], historical [[Land Wursten]]
#'''[[North Frisia]]''' in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany corresponds roughly to:
#* [[Heligoland]]
#* the [[Nordfriesland|Nordfriesland district]]

The three groups of the [[Frisian Islands]] (the [[West Frisian Islands|West]], [[East Frisian Islands|East]] and [[North Frisian Islands|North]] Frisian Islands) stretch more or less correspondingly along these three sections of the [[German Bight]] coast.

'''West Frisia''' corresponds roughly to the Dutch [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Friesland]] (''Fryslân''), the northern part of [[North Holland]] province (the historical region of [[West Friesland (historical region)|West Friesland]], the westernmost portion of the traditional region of [[West Frisia (historical)|West Frisia]]), and also modern [[Groningen (province)|Groningen province]], though the Western Frisian language is only spoken in Friesland proper. [[Dialect]]s with strong West Frisian [[substratum|substrate]]s, including [[Low German]] and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]], are also spoken in West Frisia. In the northern province of Groningen, people speak [[Gronings]], a [[Low German|Low Saxon]] dialect with a strong Frisian substrate. Rural Groningen was originally part of the Frisian lands "east of River Lauwers" and by law and language closer linked to East Frisia than to the west.

'''East Frisia''' includes areas located in the northwest of the German state of [[Lower Saxony]], including the districts of [[Aurich (district)|Aurich]], [[Leer (district)|Leer]], [[Wittmund (district)|Wittmund]] and [[Friesland (district)|Friesland]], as well as the urban districts of [[Emden]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]], the [[Saterland]], the [[Land Wursten]] and former [[Rüstringen]] ("[[Butjadingen]] peninsula"). [[East Frisia]] is also the name of a historical county in that region. Only people from that area consider themselves as East Frisians. The German name "Ostfriesland" distinguishes the former county from "Ost-Friesland", which means the whole eastern Frisian area.

The portions of '''North Frisia''' within the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] are part of the district of [[Nordfriesland]] and stretch along the coast, including the coastal islands from the [[Eider River]] to the border of Denmark in the north. The [[North Sea]] island of [[Heligoland]], while not part of the Nordfriesland district, is also part of traditional North Frisia. North Frisia was until the [[Second Schleswig War]] 1864 part of [[Denmark]] or the Danish [[Duchy of Schleswig]].

== Languages ==
A half-million Frisians in the province of Friesland in the Netherlands speak [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]. Several thousand people in Nordfriesland and Heligoland in Germany speak a collection of [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] dialects that are often unintelligible to each other.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} A small number of [[Saterland Frisian language]] speakers live in four villages in [[Lower Saxony]], in the [[Saterland]] region of [[Cloppenburg]] county, just beyond the boundaries of traditional [[East Frisia]]. Many Frisians speak [[West Low German|Low Saxon]] dialects known as [[Friso-Saxon]], especially in East Frisia, where the local dialects are called "Oostfreesk" ('East Frisian') or [[East Frisian Low Saxon]]. In the Province of Friesland and North Frisia there are also areas where Friso-Saxon dialects are predominantly spoken, such as [[Gronings]]. In [[West Frisia]], there are West Frisian-influenced dialects of Dutch such as [[West Frisian Dutch]] and [[Stadsfries]].

== History ==
{{main article|Frisian history}}
Frisia has changed dramatically over time, both through floods and through a change in identity. It is part of the supposed [[Nordwestblock]] which is a hypothetical historic region linked by language and culture.

=== Roman times ===
The people, later to be known as [[Frisii]], began settling in Frisia in the 6th century BC. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], in Roman times, the Frisians (or rather their close neighbours, the [[Chauci]]) lived on [[terp]]s, man-made hills.&lt;ref name="Bos2001"&gt;{{cite book|location=Tübingen|publisher=Niemeyer|editor1-last=Munske|editor1-first=Horst H.|editor2-last=Århammar|editor2-first=Nils R.|title=Handbuch des Friesischen = Handbook of Frisian studies|year=2001|isbn=9783484730489|language=|chapter=Archaeological evidence pertaining to the Frisians in the Netherlands|pages=487–492|last=Bos|first=Jurjen M.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nx-GUm-0OIC&amp;pg=PA480|accessdate=2009-01-11}}{{rp|page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other sources, the Frisians lived along a broader expanse of the North Sea (or "Frisian Sea") coast.{{efn|A more extensive, though outdated review of Frisia in Roman times is {{cite journal|location=Northfield, MN|publisher=The Classical Association of the Middle West and South|journal=The Classical Journal|issn=0009-8353|volume=48|issue=4|date=Jan 1953|last=Springer|first=Lawrence A.|title=Rome's Contact with the Frisians|pages=109–111|jstor=3292503}}}}

Frisia at this time comprised the present provinces of [[Friesland]] and parts of [[North Holland]] and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]].

=== Early Middle Ages ===
{{main article|Frisian kingdom}}
[[File:Frisia 600-734-la.svg|right|thumb|225px|'''The Frisian Realm''' during its great expansion]]
[[File:Frisian kingdom.gif|thumb|300px|The Frisian kingdom, 6th - 8th century.]]
Frisian presence during the Early Middle Ages has been documented from North-Western Flanders up to the Weser River Estuary. According to archaeological evidence, these Frisians were not the Frisians of Roman times, but the descendants of Anglo-Saxon immigrants from the [[German Bight]], arriving during the Great Migration. By the 8th century, ethnic Frisians also started to colonize the coastal areas North of the Eider River under Danish rule. The nascent Frisian languages were spoken all along the southern North Sea coast&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Frisian-language|title=Frisian language|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Today, the whole region is sometimes referred to as '''Greater Frisia''' or ''Frisia Magna''.

Distant authors seem to have made little distinction between Frisians and Saxons. The Byzantine [[Procopius]] described three peoples living in Great Britain: Angles, Frisians and Britons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Homans|title=The Frisians in East Anglia|pages=189–206|doi=10.2307/2590857 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some East Anglian sources called the mainland inhabitants [[Varni tribe|Warnii]], rather than Frisians.

During the 7th and 8th centuries, [[Franks|Frankish]] chronologies mention the northern [[Low Countries]] as the kingdom of the Frisians. According to Medieval legends, this kingdom comprised the coastal ''seelande'' provinces of the [[Netherlands]], from the Scheldt River to the Weser River and further East. Archaeological research does not confirm this idea, as the petty kingdoms appear to have been rather small and short-lived.

The earliest Frisian records name four social classes, the ''[[etheling]]s'' (''[[Nobility|nobiles]]'' in Latin documents) and ''frilings'', who together made up the "Free Frisians" who might bring suit at court, and the ''laten'' or ''liten'' with the [[slave]]s, who were absorbed into the ''laten'' during the [[Early Middle Ages]], as slavery was not so much formally abolished, as evaporated.{{efn|Homans describes Frisian social institutions, based on the summary by {{cite book|location=Breslau|publisher=Marcus|series=Untersuchungen zur deutschen staats- und Rechtsgeschichte|volume=144|last=Siebs|first=Benno E.|title=Grundlagen und Aufbau der altfriesischen Verfassung|language=German|year=1933|oclc=604057407|url=|accessdate=}} Siebs' synthesis was extrapolated from survivals detected in later medieval documents.&lt;ref name="Homans1957" /&gt;}} The ''laten'' were tenants of lands they did not own and might be tied to it in the manner of [[serf]]s, but in later times might buy their freedom.&lt;ref name="Homans1957" /&gt;{{rp|page=202}}

The basic land-holding unit for assessment of taxes and military contributions was - according to Homans - the ''ploegg'' (cf. "plow") or ''teen'' (cf. [[tithing]], cf. "[[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]]"), which, however, also passed under other local names. The ''teen'' was pledged to supply ten men for the ''heer'', or army. ''Ploegg'' or ''teen'' formed a unit of which the members were collectively responsible for the performance of any of the men. The ''ploegg'' or East Frisian ''rott'' was a compact holding that originated with a single lineage or kinship, whose men in early times went to war under their chief, and devolved in medieval times into a union of neighbors rather than kith and kin. Several, often three, ''ploeggs'' were grouped into a ''burar'', whose members controlled and adjudicated the uses of pasturage (but not tillage) which the ''ploeggs'' held in common, and came to be in charge of roads, ditches and dikes. Twelve ''ploeggs'' made up a "long" hundred,{{efn|This is part of the evidence for a [[Duodecimal|duodenary system]], counting by multiples of twelve.&lt;ref name="Homans1957" /&gt; {{rp|at=204 and ''passim''}}}} responsible for supplying a hundred armed men, four of which made a ''go'' (cf. ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]''). Homans' ideas, which were largely based on studies now considered to be outdated, have not been followed up by Continental scolars.

{{main article|Frisian-Frankish Wars}}
The 7th-century '''Frisian realm''' (650-734) under the kings [[Aldegisel]] and [[Redbad, King of the Frisians|Redbad]], had its centre of power in the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. Its ancient customary law was drawn up as the ''[[Lex Frisionum]]'' in the late eighth century. Its end came in 734 at the [[Battle of the Boarn]], when the Frisians were defeated by the [[Franks]], who then conquered the western part up to the [[Lauwers]]. Frankish troops conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785, after [[Charlemagne]] defeated the Saxon leader [[Widukind]]. The Carolingians laid Frisia under the rule of ''grewan'', a title that has been loosely related to [[count]] in its early sense of "governor" rather than "[[Feudalism|feudal overlord]]".&lt;ref name="Homans1957" /&gt;{{rp|page=205}}

During the 7th to 10th centuries, Frisian merchants and skippers played an important part in the international luxury trade, establishing commercial districts in distant cities as Sigtuna, Hedeby, Ribe, York, London, Duisburg, Cologne, Mainz, and Worms.

The Frisian coastal areas were partly occupied by [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish Vikings]] in the 840s, until these were expelled between 885 and 920. Recently, it been suggested that the [[Vikings]] did not conquer Frisia, but settled peacefully in certain districts (such as the islands of Walcheren and Wieringen), where they built simple forts and cooperated and traded with the native Frisians. One of their leaders was [[Rorik of Dorestad]].

=== Upstalsboom League ===
During the 12th century Frisian noblemen and the city of [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] founded the Upstalsboom League under the slogan of 'Frisian freedom' to counter [[feudalism|feudalizing tendencies]]. The league consisted of modern [[Friesland]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[East Frisia]], [[Harlingerland]], [[Jever]] and [[Rüstringen]]. The Frisian districts in [[West Friesland (historical region)|West Friesland]] West of the [[Zuiderzee]] did not participate, neither did the districts North of the [[Eider River]] along the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[North Sea]] coast ([[Schleswig-Holstein]]). Former were occupied by the count of [[Holland]] in 1289, the latter were governed by the Duke of [[Schleswig]] and the king of [[Denmark]]. The same holds true for the district of [[Land Wursten]] East of the [[Weser River]]. The Upstalsboom League was revived in the early 14th century, but it collapsed after 1337. By then the non-Frisian city of Groningen took the lead of the independent coastal districts.

=== 15th century ===
[[File:Grotepier TN.JPG|200px|thumb|Statue of [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]], known for his legendary strength and size]]
The 15th century saw the demise of Frisian republicanism. In [[East Frisia]] a leading nobleman from the Cirksena-family managed to defeat his competitors with the help of the Hanseatic League. In 1464 he acquired the title of count of East Frisia. The [[king of Denmark]] was successful in subduing the coastal districts North of the Eider River. The Dutch provinces of [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] remained independent until 1498. By then Friesland was conquered by Duke [[Albrecht of Saxony|Albert of Saxony-Meissen]]. The city of [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], which had started to dominate the surrounding rural districts, surrendered to count Edzard of East Frisia in 1506. The city conveyed its remaining privileges to the Habsburg Empire in 1536. The district of Butjadingen (formerly Rüstringen) was occupied by the Count of Oldenburg in 1514, the Land Wursten by the Prince-bishop of Bremen in 1525.

== Modern age ==

In the early 16th century, the pirate [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] (Grutte Pier) challenged Saxon authority in Friesland during a prolonged guerrilla war, backed by the Duke of Guelders. He had several successes and was feared by Holland authorities, but he died as a farmer in 1520. According to the legend he was seven feet tall. A statue dedicated to him has recently been installed in [[Kimswert]].

In the 1560s many Frisans joined the revolt led by William of Orange against the Habsburg monarchy. In 1577 the province of Friesland became part of the nascent [[Dutch Republic]], as its representatives signed the [[Union of Utrecht]]. The city of Groningen [[Siege of Groningen (1594)|was conquered]] by the Dutch in 1594. Since then, membership of the Dutch Republic was perceived as a guarantee for the preservation of civil liberties. Actual power, however, was usurped by the landowning gentry. Protests against aristocratic rule led to a democratic movement in the 1780s.

== Contemporary regionalism ==

During the late 19th and early 20th century, 'Frisian freedom' became the slogan of a [[regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] movement in Friesland, demanding equal rights for the Frisian language and culture within the Netherlands. The West Frisian language and its urban dialects are spoken by the majority of the inhabitants. In East Frisia, the idea of ''Frisian freedom'' became entangled with regional sentiments as well, though the East Frisian language had been replaced by [[Low German]] dialects as early as the 15th century. In Groningen, on the other hand, Frisian sentiments faded away at the end of the 16th century. In North Frisia regional sentiments concentrate around the surviving North Frisian dialects, which are spoken by a sizeable minority of the population, though Lower German is far more widespread.

=== Frisian territories ===
*When [[West Friesland (historical region)|West Friesland]] was conquered by the [[County of Holland]] in 1289, this was the end of a series of [[Friso-Hollandic Wars|wars between the county of Holland and Friesland]] that started at the end of the 11th century. The Dutch conquest occurred immediately after the disastrous [[St. Lucia's flood]] in which many Frisians in the area were killed. After the conquest the district of West Friesland, which also comprised the islands of [[Wieringen]], [[Texel]], and [[Vlieland]], had its own seats in the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|Estates of Holland and West Friesland]]. When the province of Holland was split up in the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|constitutional reform]] of 1840, West-Friesland became a part of [[North Holland]]. The name of West Friesland has also been used by an intercommunal administrative board (samenwerkingsregio) and a drainage board (waterschap). Until the current day a distinct West-Frisian language is spoken in West-Friesland (Westfries).
*[[Friesland]] became an independent member of the Dutch Republic in 1581. It is now a Dutch province, in 1996 renamed as ''[[Fryslân]]''.
*The islands of [[Terschelling]], [[Ameland]], and [[Schiermonnikoog]] were independent seignories, which were integrated into the province of Friesland during the 19th and 20th centuries.
*[[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], formerly ''Stad en Lande'' (the city of Groningen and its surroundings), became an independent member of the Dutch Republic in 1594. Now it is a Dutch province. As a rule, its inhabitants do not consider their province as a part of Frisia, though the area has many cultural ties with neighbouring East Frisia.
*[[East Frisia]] was an independent county since 1464, later a principality within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until 1744. By then, it was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. After a period of Dutch and French rule, it became part of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] in 1814, which was annexed by Prussia in 1866. Now it consists of several districts within the federal state of [[Lower Saxony]] in the [[Federal Republic of Germany]].
*[[Harlingerland]] was a seignory, inherited by the count of [[East Frisia]] in 1600.
*[[Jever]] was a seignory, annexed by the [[County of Oldenburg]] in 1573 and, after a prolonged period of Saxony-Anhalt, Russian, Dutch and French rule, reunited with Oldenburg in 1814. It is now part of the district of Friesland within the federal state of [[Lower Saxony]]
*[[Kniphausen]] was a seignory, split off from the County of Oldenburg in 1667 and reunited with its surroundings in 1854 (effectively in 1813).
*[[Saterland]] was a tiny Frisian district under the Prince-bishop of [[Münster]], in 1814 assigned to the [[Kingdom of Hannover]].
*[[Butjadingen]] was a coastal republic, a remnant of the largely submerged district of [[Rüstringen]], It was conquered by the Count of [[Oldenburg]] in 1514. After a period of Danish rule, it became part of the [[Duchy of Oldenburg]] in 1774, which remained a more or less independent state within the German Empire until 1918. Butjadingen is now part of the district of Wesermarsch within the federal state of [[Lower Saxony]].
*[[Land Wursten]] was a coastal republic, conquered by the Prince-bishop of Bremen in 1525. It became part of the Duchy of Bremen-Verden. The latter was, after a period of Swedish rule, integrated into the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] in 1715. It is now part of the district of [[Cuxhaven]] within the federal state of [[Lower Saxony]].
*[[North Frisia]] correspond originally to the [[Uthlande]] in the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], later North Frisia became a part of the Danish [[Duchy of Schleswig]] (or [[Southern Jutland]], ''Sønderjylland'') and of the royal enclaves (''Kongerigske enklaver'') of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]]. The duchy was conquered by [[Prussia]] in 1864. Now it forms a district within the federal state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. [[Helgoland]] is part of the district of Pinneberg. North Frisia was at no time part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

==Flag==
[[File:Flag of Frisia.svg|thumb|250px|Interfrisian flag of the ''Groep fan Auwerk'']]
[[File:Interfrisian Flag.svg|thumb|250px|Interfrisian flag of the Interfrisian Council]]
Although the Frisian regions have their own separate flags, Frisia as a whole has not historically had a flag of its own. A flag for a united Frisia, known as the ''Interfrisian Flag'', was launched in September 2006 by the [[Groep fan Auwerk]] ([[English language|English]]: ''Group of [[Aurich]]''). This [[Separatism|separatist group]] supports a united Frisia as a recognized country. The design was inspired by the [[Nordic Cross flag]]. The four ''[[pompeblêden]]'' (water lily leaves) represent the contemporary variety of the Frisian regions—North, South, West and East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groepfanauwerk.com/homeIflagge.html Description of the Interfrisian flag]&lt;/ref&gt;

This flag was not accepted by the [[Interfrisian Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://interfriesischerrat.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=1 Press release from the Interfrisian Council]&lt;/ref&gt; But the council adopted the idea of an interfrisian flag and created an own design, containing elements of flags of the councils's three sections. Neither flag is in wide use.

[[File:SAR-Subregioni-Gallura.jpg|thumb|right|map of Gallura]]
'''Gallura''' is a region in the northeast of the island of [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]].

The name ''Gallùra'' ({{lang-sdn|Gaddùra}} {{IPA-co|ɡaˈɖːuɾa|}}, {{lang-sc|Caddura}}) is allegedly supposed to mean "stony area".

== Geography ==
Gallùra has a surface of {{convert|1370|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} and it is situated between 40°55'20"64 latitude north and 09°29'11"76 east longitude. It is 187 kilometers from the Italian [[peninsula]] and 11 kilometers from the French island of [[Corsica]].
The coast of Gallura is very jagged and continues along in a continuous series of small fiords, rock-cliffs and little islands that form the [[archipelago]] of [[La Maddalena]], a natural bridge towards nearby Corsica.
The landscape is characterised by [[granite]] rocks and harsh mountains that, even if not particularly high, have constituted for millennia a barrier between this region and the nearby territories of [[Baronie]] and [[Montalbo]]. [[Monte Limbara]] is the highest mountain (1,362 m/4,469&amp;nbsp;ft). It represents the boundary between Gallura and the nearby region called [[Logudoro]]. Its highest peak is [[Punta Balestrieri]] (1362 m above the sea level). In the past, Monte Limbara used to be the location of an important [[NATO]] long range [[radar]] base and a [[Carabinieri]]’s barrack. Today it is used as a [[telecommunications]] center for the Italian Air Force and a [[heliport]] for the Servizio Antincendi. It is also the location of all the major TV [[Broadcast relay station|relay station]]s of West Sardinia. Another small mountain is Monte Cruzitta (666 m). Even if it is not very high, it offers a very characteristic landscape.
The [[climate]] is typical of the Mediterranean. The weather is clear. During the year approximately 300 days are sunny and the few others are rainy, with a major concentration of [[rainfall]] in the winter and autumn, some heavy showers in the spring, and snowfalls on the highest [[massif]]s and highlands. The [[mistral (wind)|mistral]] is the dominant wind, fresh, strong, and usually dry and cold, blowing from the northwest throughout the year, but most frequently in winter and spring.

== History ==

=== Prehistory===
The first human settlements in Gallura date back to 700.000 years ago, when the first populations crossed the strait between [[Tuscany]] and Sardinia. This historic period is known as the [[Stone Age]].
Foreign populations colonize Gallura due to its numerous natural resources. Many people from the nearby island of Corsica came as well to Gallura during this historic period. The mid-late neolithic [[Arzachena culture]] subsisted almost exclusively in this area, and here is found the remains of perhaps the oldest [[megalith]] on Sardinia, at [[Necropolis of Li Muri|Li Muri]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sinclair &amp; J. Bradbury; ''Megaliths and their Mysteries''; 1979; MacMillan Publishing; pp. 104-108&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From Nuragic Prehistory to Antiquity ===
[[File:Nuraghe Izzana (circa 1600 a.C.) (8286907194).jpg|thumb|Nuraghe Izzana]]
The historic period that goes from 1700 BC to the Roman Age is also known in Sardinia as the [[Nuragic civilization|Nuragic Age]]. The particular name of this historic period takes after the [[Nuraghe]]s, the biggest megalithic edifices ever found in Europe, which still today represent a symbol for Sardinia.
 
The [[Phoenicia]]ns founded the (hence Punic) city of [[Olbia]] (renamed in Greek, though), which was conquered by the Romans with all of Gallura in 238 BC.

=== The [[Giudicato of Gallura]] ===
During the [[Middle Ages]], Gallura was one of the four ''[[giudicati]]'', the four autonomous states into which Sardinia was divided under pope Alexander's assent. 
[[Civita]] (which today is known as Olbia) was the capital of the Giudicato of Gallura and the (first) bishop's see.
The [[Giudicato of Gallura]] included today's area of Gallura, the area surrounding the city of [[Nuoro]], and the area called Baronie. It was occupied by the [[republic of Pisa]] in 1288 after the fall of the last ruling judge [[Nino Visconti]].

=== Late Middle Ages till the eighteenth century===
At the end of the 13th century, the city of Civita (today's Olbia) takes the name of Terranova, a new settlement founded by the pisans near the site of the ancient Roman port of Olbia.
[[Pirate]]s – primarily from [[North Africa]] – [[raid (military)|raided]] the coasts of Gallura and people moved consequently from there to the hinterland. The city of [[Tempio]] became especially populated.
Between 1300 and 1800 there was a big emigration of people from the nearby island of [[Corsica]] to Gallura. [[Corsicans]] deeply influenced the language and the culture of Gallura, which still today is considered quite different from the culture and the dialects of the rest of Sardinia.

By the end of the 1700s people started to move from the hinterland to the coasts.

=== Nineteenth century, Twentieth century and today ===
During the nineteenth century the [[Episcopal see|bishop's see]] was transferred from the city of Olbia to the city of Tempio, which also became a district's capital.
[[File:Harrods Porto Cervo.JPG|thumbnail|The [[Bugatti]] stand at [[Harrods]] in [[Porto Cervo]]]]
In the second half of the 20th century, [[tourism]] increased greatly, especially in the areas of [[Costa Smeralda]], [[Santa Teresa di Gallura]] and [[San Teodoro, Sardinia|San Teodoro]].
Today, Gallura has the highest capital income in all of Sardinia.

=== Ecclesiastical history ===
The region's original Roman bishopric, the [[Diocese of Fausania]] (P(h)ausania), founded no later than the 5th century (tradition says by the 3rd century saint Simplicius), of disputed location ([[Olbia]], [[Tempio Pausania]] or Posano) perished under Byzantine rule, probably in the 8th century.

It was restored under the name of Gallura in 1070, renamed Civita after its see (the medieval name of Olbia) and from 1506 held in personal union with the [[Diocese of Ampurias]], but no later than the 12th century a second bishopric was established, the [[Diocese of Galtelli]].

== Demographics ==
Gallura has a population of 143,921 people. The [[population density]] has remarkably increased in small centers along the eastern coast and in the cities of [[Arzachena]] and Olbia. The population density of 12 municipalities out of 26 has however decreased (-4%) in centers located in the country -side and on the mountains. This tendency depends on the increase of the seaside tourism.

In general, Sardinia represents the Italian region with the lowest [[fertility rate]] (1.087 births per woman), and the region with the second lowest [[birth rate]]. These factors result positive towards the preservation of the natural environment.

===Main towns===
; Olbia
[[Olbia]] (medieval Civita) is a town of approximately 55,000 inhabitants. It represents the city with the highest population density of the entire Gallura. In 2005 it became an [[administrative capital]] together with Tempio-Pausania. They form the province called Olbia-Tempio.
Founded in 350 BC, it used to be one of the most important trade areas of the Mediterranean Sea.
Today, it represents the economic center of Sardinia due to its [[airport]], its [[seaport]] and also to its closeness to the famous Costa Smeralda tourist area.

; Tempio Pausania
[[Tempio Pausania]] is a town of 13,800 inhabitants. Together with Olbia, it is the administrative capital of the province Olbia-Tempio.
Founded around 250 BC, Tempio Pausania is located 560m above the sea level. It represents  both the geographical and the cultural capital of Gallura. Every year, thousands of tourists come to visit Tempio Pausania to assist to the characteristic carnevale (carnival), which takes place at the end of February.

; Arzachena
[[Arzachena]] is a town of 12,080 inhabitants. 
It represents the administrative capital of the Costa Smeralda tourist area. Founded in 1961 by the prince Karim Aga Khan, Costa Smeralda represents the most exclusive tourist area of Gallura.
Arzachena is also famous for its archeology. Its archeological sites include the LiMuri Tomba dei Giganti (Giants’ Grave).

; La Maddalena
[[La Maddalena]] is part of an archipelago called Arcipelago della Maddalena. It is situated in the [[Straits of Bonifacio]], which divide Sardinia from Corsica. La Maddalena represents the largest town of this archipelago, which includes the islands of Caprera, S. Stefano, Spargi, Budelli, S. Maria and Razzoli. La Maddalena represents an important tourist site in Gallura and the island of Caprera is famous for being the residence of the Italian revolutionary [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].

== Economy ==
[[File:Santa Teresa di Gallura 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Santa Teresa di Gallura]]]]
The economy of Gallura is based mostly on tourism and hospitality due to the presence of Costa Smeralda and other world-famous sea sites.
The primary sector is not as important as in the rest of Sardinia. It is based mostly on [[wine]] production. Also [[sheep]] breeding, dairy production, and [[poultry]] farm are relevant.
The secondary sector is quite important. It is mostly based on cork work and mineral processing of granite. In fact, it is easy to find cork oaks in many parts of the region and the whole area is rich in granite, especially in vicinity of Monte Limbara. Cork production is one of the main economic activity in the interior, while on the coasts are developed fish factories and shipyards.

=== Transportation ===
Gallura has one international airport ([[Olbia-Costa Smeralda Airport]]), which is situated in the city of Olbia. It represents one of the three international airports of Sardinia and the base of the Sardinian airline [[Meridiana]], Italy's third-largest airline.

Another way to reach the region of Gallura is by [[ferry]]. The ferry companies operating on the Island are Tirrenia di Navigazione, Moby Lines, Corsica Ferry, Grandi Navi Veloci, Snav, SNCM and CMN. They link the harbors of Olbia, Golfo Aranci, Santa Teresa di Gallura and Palau to the harbors of the Italian peninsula, France, Corsica and Spain.

== Culture ==

===Language===
The native language of the area is [[Gallurese language|Gallurese]], which is also recognized by the Regional Government of Sardinia. Gallurese is usually not considered a dialect of [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], since it is quite different from most of the other Sardinian dialects, but rather as a direct offshoot from [[Corsican language|Corsican]]. [[Luras]] and [[Padru]], two small towns in the province of Olbia-Tempio, are the only areas in Gallura in which Gallurese is not traditionally spoken. Sardinian is also spoken in its [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese variety]].

== Environment ==
With 1,213,250 hectares of woods, Sardinia represents the Italian region with the largest forest extension. Regional landscape plans regulate building activities along the coasts, the forests, and other natural sites.

; National Parks
[[File:La Maddalena national park.jpg|thumb|right|[[La Maddalena]]'s [[Arcipelago di La Maddalena National Park|national park]]]]
Sardinia has ten [[regional park in Italy|regional park]]s and three [[national park in Italy|national park]]s. One of these three national parks is located in Gallura, i.e., the [[Arcipelago di La Maddalena National Park|Archipelago of La Maddalena's National Park]]. This park is a world-famous tourist area due to the beauty of its beaches and to the one of its landscape, where granite rocks alternate with green areas.

===Renewable energies===
Renewable energies have increased impressively during the recent years in Sardinia. Due to the windy climate, the most important [[renewable energy]] in Gallura is the wind power. During the past years however, the installation of wind power systems has been the subject of controversial debates due to its landscape impact.

The '''geographic center of the contiguous United States''' is the center of 48 [[U.S. state]]s. It has been regarded as such by the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]] (NGS) since the 1912 additions of [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] to the [[United States]].

==Overview==
Its position as located in a 1918 survey is located at {{coord|39|50|N|98|35|W|region:US-KS_type:landmark|name=Geographic Center of the Contiguous United States}}, about {{convert|2.6|mi|km}} northwest of the center of [[Lebanon, Kansas]], approximately {{convert|12|mi|km}} south of the [[Kansas]]–[[Nebraska]] border.&lt;ref name=doigs&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographical Centers of the United States|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/unnumbered/70039437/report.pdf|website=USGS Publications Warehouse|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior Geological Survey|accessdate=13 May 2015|date=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While any measurement of the exact center of a land mass will always be imprecise due to changing shorelines and other factors, the NGS coordinates are recognized in a historical marker in a small park at the intersection of AA Road and [[K-191 (Kansas highway)|K-191]]. It is accessible by a turn-off from [[U.S. Route 281]].

It is distinct from the [[geographic center of the United States]], which reflects the 1959 additions of the states of [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]], which is located at a point northeast of [[Belle Fourche, South Dakota]].

In an unusual technical glitch, a farmstead northeast of [[Potwin, Kansas]], became the default site of 600 million [[IP address]]es (due to their lack of fine granularity) when the Massachusetts-based digital mapping company [[MaxMind]] changed the putative geographic center of the contiguous United States from 39.8333333,-98.585522 to 38.0000,-97.0000.&lt;ref name="Potwin, Kansas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fusion.net/story/287592/internet-mapping-glitch-kansas-farm/ | title=How an internet mapping glitch turned a random Kansas farm into a digital hell | publisher=Fusion | date=2016-04-10 | accessdate=2016-04-10 | author=Hill, Kashmir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marker==
[[Image:LebanonMarker1.JPG|thumb|upright|The marker located near [[Lebanon, Kansas]]]]
[[Image:48states plaque.jpg|thumb|upright|A close-up of the plaque on the historical marker]]
[[Image:LebanonMarker2.JPG|thumb|A small chapel and picnic ground adjacent to the marker]]
[[Image:Monument at the Geographical Center Of The US 48 contiguous States.jpg|thumb|An additional monument adjacent to the marker]]

In order to protect the privacy of the private land owner where the point identified by the 1918 survey falls,&lt;ref&gt;"The actual center is about a half mile away in the center of a former hog farm." ([http://www.clui.org/clui_4_1/lotl/lotlsp99/geo.html kansastravel.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825000000/http://www.clui.org/clui_4_1/lotl/lotlsp99/geo.html |date=August 25, 2006 }})&lt;/ref&gt; a proxy marker was erected in 1940 some half a mile away.&lt;ref&gt;Walter H. Schoewe, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/3625750.pdf "Kansas and the geodetic datum of North America"], ''Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science'' 51 (1948) 117–124, www.jstor.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Its inscription reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The GEOGRAPHIC CENTER of the UNITED STATES&lt;br /&gt;
LAT. 39°50' LONG. -98°35'&lt;br /&gt;
NE 1/4 - SE 1/4 - S32 - T2S - R11W&lt;br /&gt;
Located by L.T. Hagadorn of Paulette &amp; Wilson - Engineers and L.A. Beardslee - County Engineer. From data furnished by U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. &lt;br /&gt;
Sponsored by Lebanon Hub Club. Lebanon, Kansas. April 25, 1940
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An American flag usually flies atop a pole placed on the monument. A covered picnic area and small eight-pew chapel are nearby.

==Method of measurement==
In 1918, the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey|Coast and Geodetic Survey]] found this location by balancing on a point a cardboard cutout shaped like the U.S.&lt;ref name=ngs&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographic Center of the United States|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/GeoCenter_USA1.pdf|website=National Geodetic Survey Publications|publisher=National Geodetic Survey|accessdate=13 May 2015}} Includes a reprint of {{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Oscar S.|title=Geographical Centers|journal=The Military Engineer|date=1932|volume=24|issue=138|pages=586–587}} Describes cardboard method used "a number of years ago".&lt;/ref&gt; This method was accurate to within 20 miles, but while the Geodetic Survey no longer endorses any location as the center of the U.S., the identification of Lebanon, Kansas, has remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Keith Stokes |url=http://www.kansastravel.org/geographicalcenter.htm |title=Geographic Center of the United States |website=Kansastravel.org |date=2008-06-01 |accessdate=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clui.org/clui_4_1/lotl/lotlsp99/geo.html|title=The Geographical Center of the Lower 48 United States, at Lebanon, Kansas|accessdate=June 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825230502/http://www.clui.org/clui_4_1/lotl/lotlsp99/geo.html |archivedate=August 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Holy Basin''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''האגן הקדוש''', ''ha'agan ha'kadosh'', or '''Historic Basin''', [[Hebrew]]: '''האגן ההיסטורי''', ''ha'agan ha'histori'' ) is a modern [[Israel]]i term for a geographical area in [[Jerusalem]] that includes the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] and its adjacent territories. The term was coined by the contemporary Israeli generation while a political-academic discourse on how does one refers to the area in Jerusalem where the historical and holy sites are concentrated.&lt;ref&gt;Gershon Baskin, [http://www.pij.org/details.php?id=165 The Jerusalem Problem: The Search for Solutions], Palestine-Israel Journal, Vol.8 No.1 2001 / Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shehori&gt;Dalia Shehori, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/modeling-jerusalem-s-holy-basin-on-west-berlin-1.111383 Modeling Jerusalem's Holy Basin on West Berlin], [[haaretz]], 19 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The term is being used in the field of [[Geography|geographical]] research and in contemporary [[Geopolitics|geo-political]] studies specializing in [[urban planning]], such as local master plans for Jerusalem and studies concerning the political future of the city.

==Background==
The Holy Basin, in effect – Jerusalem, a concentrated geographical area of thousands of years of history and hundreds of holy places – some common to [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], and some are unique to one of the three religions. Isaac Tischler maintains that [[David Ben-Gurion]] argued that "Jerusalem is not [[Shuafat]], [[Beit Hanina]] or [[Sur Baher]], nor [[Abu Dis]], but rather the Holy Basin – the [[Temple Mount]] and the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]".&lt;ref name="globes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000096319&amp;fid=2164 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204008/http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000096319&amp;fid=2164 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-10-29 |title=תפשת מרובה לא תפשת: אשליות ועובדות בירושלים השלמה - גלובס |publisher=globes.co.il |accessdate=2014-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the suggestion of Ben-Gurion to destroy the [[Walls of Jerusalem|old city walls]] after the [[Six-Day War|unification of the city]] intended to erase the boundary between the Holy Basin and the new city.

In a comprehensive study &lt;ref name="jiis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jiis.org.il/|title=מכון ירושלים לחקר ישראל|publisher=jiis.org.il|accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the holy basin, Professor [[Ruth Lapidoth]] starts with an example out of the first speech, in the First Knesset, by the poet [[Uri Zvi Grinberg]]. In this speech, in which the poet dedicated to "[[Divided Jerusalem]]" and the Jewish yearning to the Old City across the border, he emphasized that the name ''Jerusalem'' is directed only to the Jerusalem that is within the walls of Jerusalem, "where Temple Mount lies", and all that was built in the [[Modern history|modern era]] – beyond the holy basin, is no more than "fecundation of Jerusalem. "

==Geography==
Areas of the Holy Basin area are not clearly defined and region boundaries are not agreed upon by all geographers engaged in the study of Jerusalem. A limited version sees the old city surrounded by the [[Walls of Jerusalem]] as the Holy Basin. A more expanded version sees [[Mount of Olives]], [[Mount Zion]] and the [[City of David]] also as part of the Holy Basin.

===Boundaries===
In a study conducted for the [[Research Institute of Jerusalem]], the researchers Kobi Michael and Dr Moshe Hirsch drew the precise boundaries of the basin as follows:&lt;ref name=Shehori/&gt;

Core region: westerly − along the old city walls up to the southwestern corner. southerly − along the channel of [[Gehenna]], through the south of the wall surrounding the monastery of [[Akeldama]]. From there, to the north to the eastern wall of [[Church of St. Peter in Gallicantu|Gallicantu Peter's Church]]. From there, to the southern wall of the Old City up to the Southern Wall excavations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archpark.org.il/index.asp Southern Wall excavations].&lt;/ref&gt; (Ophel Garden&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archpark.org.il/index.asp Ophel Garden].&lt;/ref&gt;). From there, to the [[Valley of Josaphat]] up to the [[Ras al-Amud]] road – including the [[Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery]].

Easterly – along the Jewish burial plots on Mount of Olives up to the section of the wall of the Russian Church [[Chapel of the Ascension (Jerusalem)|Chapel of the Ascension]], up to [[Al Makassed Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almakassed.org/site.aspx Al Makassed Hospital].&lt;/ref&gt; through the wall of [[Viri Galilaei church]]. Northerly – from Viri galilaei church, to the northeast corner of the city walls of the Old City, and along the wall up to the Schmidt  school compound, and along the wall up to its corner in [[Jaffa Road]]. Over all, a sum total of 2,012 acres.

===Population===
According to the Research Institute of Jerusalem,&lt;ref name="jiis2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jiis.org.il/content.asp?newsID=13|title=מכון ירושלים לחקר ישראל|publisher=jiis.org.il|accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in late 2003, 35,400 residents lived in the Old City, and in the entire Holy Basin around 40,000. 73% of the residents in the old city were Muslims, 18% Christians, and 9%
were Jews.

Out of 900 acres where the old town is situated, about 210 acres owned by the [[Waqf]] (24%) (mostly on the [[Temple Mount]], an area of approximately 144 acres); About 270 acres owned by the Christian Churches and monasteries (30%); 250 acres of Arab private land ownership (28%), and about 170 acres owned by the state (18%).

Out of 6,000 families who live in the Old City, 68% are Muslim, 24% Christian, and 8% are Jewish.

About half the lands of the Old City are being used for residence, 280 acres are being used for religious and educational institutions, and 80 acres for trade. Archaeological sites stretch over 50 acres, and there are also 40 acres that are not being used.

==Geo-political disputes==
The Holy Basin is not only the center of Jerusalem, but also in the center of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], and any negligible controversy may turn into an international incident. The latest example for such incident was the uproar against the Rescue excavations at the [[Gates of the Temple Mount#Moroccans' Gate|Mughrabi Gate]] in early 2007, an event that joins a series of events, some of which included casualties.

In 2006, the [[Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies]], headed by Ruth Lapidot, conducted a research on alternatives to the sovereignty over the Holy Basin. According to this study there are five solutions to the Holy Basin:&lt;ref&gt;[[Aluf Benn|אלוף בן]], [http://www.haaretz.co.il/1.1267987 אהוד אולמרט כמעט עשה היסטוריה: וויתור ישראלי על האגן הקדוש].&lt;/ref&gt;

*The first alternative offers full control and sovereignty of the [[State of Israel]] over all the Holy basin, while providing some [[autonomy]] to the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]. The meaning of this proposal is practically the institutionalization of the current situation on the ground, where Muslim and Christian clerics run their own institutions autonomously.
*The second alternative is radically different – sovereignty and [[Palestinian National Authority|full control of the Palestinians]] over all the Holy Basin, with an autonomy to Jewish residents.
*The third alternative offers a territorial partition between the parties with international supervision.
*Fourth alternative offers co-management, and the division of power between the two parties with international backing.
*The fifth alternative: the management of the Holy Basin would be run by an international body as one unit. The international body will not only hold supervisory authority and control, but will also be responsible for managing the Holy Basin, and will be the source of authority and control in the Holy Basin.

The researchers Kobi Michael and Dr Moshe Hirsch presented a study in which the option that is most applicable is rather the model based on [[West Berlin]] – an area managed as an autonomous entity under international supervision – agreed upon all parties.&lt;ref name=Shehori/&gt;

&lt;!-- [[Image:SoftwareEchoscape.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Screensave of active hydroacoustics detecting fish.]] image deleted on commons --&gt;
'''Hydroacoustics''' is the study and application of sound in water.  Hydroacoustics, using [[sonar]] technology, is most commonly used for monitoring of underwater physical and biological characteristics. 
[[File:Collecting Multibeam Sonar Data.jpg|thumb|Collecting Multibeam Sonar Data]] 

Hydroacoustics can be used to detect the depth of a water body ([[bathymetry]]), as well as the presence or absence, abundance, distribution, size, and behavior of underwater plants&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/pls/erdcpub/!www_fact_sheet.product_page?ps_product_numb=112825&amp;tmp_Main_Topic=&amp;page=STATUS  &lt;/ref&gt; and animals.  Hydroacoustic sensing involves "[[passive acoustics]]" (listening for sounds) or ''[[active acoustics]]'' making a sound and listening for the echo, hence the common name for the device, [[echo sounder]] or [[echosounder]].  

There are a number of different causes of noise from shipping. These can be subdivided into those caused by the propeller, those caused by machinery, and those caused by the movement of the hull through the water. The relative importance of these three different categories will depend, amongst other things, on the ship type&lt;ref&gt; reducing underwater noise pollution from large commercial vessels &lt;/ref&gt;
One of the main causes of hydro acoustic noise from fully submerged lifting surfaces is the unsteady separated turbulent flow near the surface's trailing edge that produces pressure fluctuations on the surface and unsteady oscillatory flow in the near wake.The relative motion between the surface and the ocean creates a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) that surrounds the surface. The noise is generated by the fluctuating velocity and pressure fields within this TBL.

*[[Americas]]&lt;ref name=Americas&gt;The division of the [[Americas]] into the [[continent]]s of [[North America]] and [[South America]] is somewhat arbitrary.  Most commonly, [[Panama]] is considered to be a part of North America and [[Colombia]] is considered a part of [[South America]].  [[Geology|Geologically]], the boundary between the two continents is defined by the boundary between the [[Caribbean Plate]] and the [[South American Plate]].  This places the boundary roughly along the Panama-Colombia border.  Other definitions place the boundary at the lowest natural crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] near the [[Panama Canal]], or along the canal itself.  Another definition places the boundary at the lowest crossing of [[Central America]] near [[Lake Nicaragua]].  This definition splits Central America between the continents of North and South America.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaskikot''' ({{lang-ne|[[:ne:कास्कीकोट|कास्कीकोट]]}}), commonly known as '''Kaski''', is a Ward no. 24 of the [[Pokhara|Pokhara Lekhnath metropolitan city]]. It was earlier a part of the [[Village development committee (Nepal)|village development committee]] in [[Kaski District]], a region in northern-central [[Nepal]].

==Geography==
[[File: Annapurna Range visible from Kaskikot.JPG|thumb|left|Annapurna Range visible from Kaskikot]]
Kaskikot is located in [[Annapurna Massif]], north of [[Fewa Lake]] at a distance of 12&amp;nbsp;kilometers west of [[Pokhara]] after [[Sarangkot]]. It is on the trekking route to the Annapurna region. A mountainside ridge at an altitude of 1,788 meters, Kaskikot provides panoramic Himalayan views. On the northern side of Kaskikot, [[Dhaulagiri|Dhawalagiri]] can be seen in the far west. The [[Annapurna Massif|Annapurna]] mountain range is clearly visible on the same side. To the east, the village overlooks the city of [[Pokhara]] across [[Fewa Lake]].

Kaskikot shares its territory with Sarangkot, Chapakot, Dhikurpokhari, and Hemja.

==History==
Before the unification of Nepal, there were [[Chaubisi rajya|24 small principalities]] in west Nepal, one of which was Kaski. 

The ruins of the old palace of the rulers of Kaski still exist in the ward. The historical kingdom was an early homeland of the [[Shah dynasty]]. Kulmandan Shah was one of the rulers who established his kingdom in west Nepal. His descendant [[Drabya Shah]] was the first to establish [[Prithbinarayan|Gorkha]], the source of the legendary Gorkha warriors. 

During [[Dasain|Dashain]] holidays, various cultural events can be witnessed.&lt;ref name="digitalhim"/&gt; Kaskikot Kalika Temple lies in the historical palace located at the top of the hill (1700 meters). During Nava Durga, Dashain and Chaitra Dashain, Kaski Guthi Sanstha organizes worship to goddess Durga Bhawani. Many people gather in Kaskikot Temple during Dashain Fulpati and Chaitra Dashain.

==Population==
At the time of the [[1991 Nepal census]], Kaskikot had a population of 6,075 people residing in 1,185 individual households.&lt;ref name="digitalhim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/collections/nepalcensus/form.php?selection=1 |title=Nepal Census 2001 |work=Nepal's Village Development Committees |publisher=[[Digital Himalaya]] |accessdate=September 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012163506/http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/collections/nepalcensus/form.php?selection=1 |archivedate=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the census of 2011, the population has decreased to 5,892 people residing in 1,508 households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cbs.gov.np/image/data/Population/VDC-Municipality%20in%20detail/40%20Kaski_VDCLevelReport.pdf|title=National Population and Housing Census 2011|last=|first=|date=March 2014|website=Central Bureau of Statistics, Nepal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most inhabitants depend on agriculture and are members of the [[Brahmin]], [[Chhetri]], [[Thakuri]], [[Magars|Magar]] and Dalit castes.{{clarify|date=January 2017}}

==Economy==
With the [[Annapurna]] and [[Dhaulagiri]] [[Himalaya]]s clearly visible to the north, Kaskikot is a tourist destination. There are hotels and guest houses in [[Deurali, Kaski|Deurali]] and [[Mala, Nepal]]. A milk collection center is located in Guntechour, which supplies milk to Pokhara. There are also small industries like poultry farming and handicrafts. General stores provide necessary goods like oil, sugar, and salts to the community.

Kaskikot Women's Financial Organization, founded by Krishna Paudel, has around 1000 members. The Kalika Community Development Organization, located in Guntechour, engages in the development of the village. Numerous organizations and Youths Clubs also organize different cultural and development work around the village.

[[File:Kaski 005.JPG|thumb|Kaskikot]]

==Village amenities==
There are primary schools in every ward. Kalika Higher Secondary School, located at [[Mandredhunga]] is the only Higher education institution teaching up to Class 12. The other Siddha Bahara Lower Secondary School goes up to Class 8. There is also a private school, namely Shree Bishwajyoti English Boarding School, that goes up to Class 8.

There is a general health post equipped with primary medicine, which operates a monthly health camp around the village. A few health sub-posts provide free treatment and vaccination to children.

Kaskikot is connected by bus routes. Apart from buses, local agricultural transport jeeps also provide a semi-reliable transport service. There are four rough motor roads connecting Kaskikot. A major road connects Kaskikot to Pokhara and Sarangkot. The other road goes from the beach of Fewa Lake, next to the midway of the hill to Guntechour connecting Naudanda [krishi sadak].{{clarify|date=January 2017}}

'''Koitelinkoski''' (i.e. ''Koiteli rapids'') is an outdoor recreation area located along the [[Kiiminkijoki]] river in the [[Kiiminki (district)|Kiiminki]] district in [[Oulu]], [[Finland]]. The area consists of small islands dividing the free-flowing river into smaller streams and [[rapids]]. The Koitelinkoski rapids stretch about three kilometers on the river.&lt;ref name="VisitOulu"/&gt; The rapids are one of the most impressive ones on the Kiiminkijoki river.&lt;ref name="Kiiminkijoki"/&gt;

The larger islands are connected with suspension bridges.&lt;ref name="VisitOulu"/&gt; There is a summer café and an event stage on the largest, Sahasaari, island.&lt;ref name="OukaMap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koiteli_Palvelut"/&gt; There are several campfire sites scattered on the islands.&lt;ref name="VisitOulu"/&gt;

{{About|the geographical reference system}} 
[[File:Division of the Earth into Gauss-Krueger zones - Globe.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] on the Earth as a [[sphere]] or an [[ellipsoid]]. The lines from pole to pole are lines of constant [[longitude]], or '''meridians'''. The circles parallel to the [[equator]] are lines of constant latitude, or '''parallels'''. The graticule shows the latitude and longitude of points on the surface. In this example meridians are spaced at 6° intervals and parallels at 4° intervals.]]

In [[geography]], '''latitude''' is a [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinate]] that specifies the [[north]]–[[south]] position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the [[Equator]] to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or ''parallels'', run east–west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with [[longitude]] to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. On its own, the term latitude should be taken to be the ''geodetic latitude'' as defined below. Briefly, geodetic latitude at a point is the angle formed by the vector perpendicular (or ''[[Normal (geometry) |  normal]]'') to the ellipsoidal surface from that point, and the equatorial plane. Also defined are six ''auxiliary latitudes'' which are used in special applications.

==Preliminaries==
Two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of latitude and longitude. In the first step the physical surface is modeled by the [[geoid]], a surface which approximates the [[Sea level|mean sea level]] over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a [[sphere]], but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the ''actual'' surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of [[Altitude|height]] constitute a [[geographic coordinate system]] as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.{{efn|The current full documentation of ISO 19111 may be purchased from http://www.iso.org but drafts of the final standard are freely available at many web sites, one such is available at the following
[https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/pub/Xmml/CoordinateReferenceSystems/19111_FDIS20021107.pdf CSIRO]}}

Since there are many different [[reference ellipsoid]]s, the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique: this is stressed in the ISO standard which states that "without the full specification of the coordinate reference system, coordinates (that is latitude and longitude) are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst". This is of great importance in accurate applications, such as a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), but in common usage, where high accuracy is not required, the reference ellipsoid is not usually stated.

In English texts the latitude angle, defined below, is usually denoted by the Greek lower-case letter [[phi (letter)|phi]] ({{mvar|φ}} or {{mvar|ϕ}}). It is measured in [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], [[arcminute|minutes and seconds]] or [[decimal degrees]], north or south of the equator.
&lt;!--The latitude of a point on the reference surface is defined as the angle between the [[Surface normal|normal]] to the reference surface (at the point in question) and the equatorial plane. A corollary of this definition is that the latitude angle of a point on the reference surface is not unique: it depends on the precise choice of the reference surface. --&gt;

The precise measurement of latitude requires an understanding of the gravitational field of the Earth, either to set up [[theodolite]]s or to determine GPS satellite orbits. The study of the [[figure of the Earth]] together with its gravitational field is the science of [[geodesy]].
&lt;!-- here except in relation to the definition of the [[#Astronomical latitude|astronomical latitude]].--&gt;

This article relates to coordinate systems for the Earth: it may be extended to cover the Moon, planets and other celestial objects by a simple change of nomenclature.

==Latitude on the sphere==
[[File:latitude and longitude graticule on a sphere.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A perspective view of the Earth showing how latitude (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) and longitude (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) are defined on a spherical model. The graticule spacing is 10 degrees.]]

===The graticule on the sphere===
The graticule is formed by the lines of constant latitude and constant longitude, which are constructed with reference to the rotation axis of the Earth. The primary reference points are the [[Geographical pole|poles]] where the axis of rotation of the Earth intersects the reference surface. Planes which contain the rotation axis intersect the surface at the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]]; and the angle between any one meridian plane and that through Greenwich (the [[Prime Meridian]]) defines the longitude: meridians are lines of constant longitude. The plane through the centre of the Earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the [[Equator]]. Planes parallel to the equatorial plane intersect the surface in circles of constant latitude; these are the parallels. The Equator has a latitude of 0°, the [[North Pole]] has a latitude of 90° North (written 90°&amp;nbsp;N or +90°), and the [[South Pole]] has a latitude of 90° South (written 90°&amp;nbsp;S or −90°). The latitude of an arbitrary point is the angle between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface at that point: the normal to the surface of the sphere is  along the radius vector.

The latitude, as defined in this way for the sphere, is often termed the spherical latitude, to avoid ambiguity with the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes defined in subsequent sections of this article.

===Named latitudes on the Earth===
[[File:December solstice geometry.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The orientation of the Earth at the December solstice.]]
Besides the equator, four other parallels are of significance:
:{| class="wikitable" border="1"
| [[Arctic Circle]] || 66° 34′ (66.57°) N
|-
| [[Tropic of Cancer]] ||23° 26′ (23.43°) N
|-
| [[Tropic of Capricorn]] || 23° 26′ (23.43°) S
|-
| [[Antarctic Circle]] || 66° 34′ (66.57°) S
|}
The plane of the Earth's orbit about the Sun is called the [[ecliptic]], and the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the Earth is the equatorial plane. The angle between the ecliptic and the equatorial plane is called variously the axial tilt, the obliquity, or the inclination of the ecliptic, and it is conventionally denoted by {{mvar|i}}. The latitude of the tropical circles is equal to {{mvar|i}} and the latitude of the polar circles is its complement (90° - ''i''). The axis of rotation varies slowly over time and the values given here are those for the current [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]. The time variation is discussed more fully in the article on [[axial tilt]].{{efn|The value of this angle today is {{circle of latitude|tropical|convert}}. This figure is provided by [[Template:Circle of latitude]].}}

The figure shows the geometry of a [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the Earth and the Sun at the December [[solstice]] when the Sun is overhead at some point of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. The south polar latitudes below the [[Antarctic Circle]] are in daylight, whilst the north polar latitudes above the Arctic Circle are in night. The situation is reversed at the June solstice, when the Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer. Only at latitudes in between the two [[tropics]] is it possible for the Sun to be directly overhead (at the [[zenith]]).

On [[map projections]] there is no universal rule as to how meridians and parallels should appear. The examples below show the named parallels (as red lines) on the commonly used [[Mercator projection]] and the [[Transverse Mercator projection]]. On the former the parallels are horizontal and the meridians are vertical, whereas on the latter there is no exact relationship of parallels and meridians with horizontal and vertical: both are complicated curves.

===Meridian distance on the sphere===
On the sphere the normal passes through the centre and the latitude ({{mvar|φ}}) is
therefore equal to the angle subtended at the centre by the meridian arc from the equator to the point concerned. If the [[Meridian arc|meridian distance]] is denoted by {{math|''m''(''φ'')}} then
:&lt;math&gt; m(\phi)=\frac{\pi}{180^\circ}R\phi_\mathrm{degrees} = R\phi_\mathrm{radians}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|R}} denotes the [[Earth radius#Mean radii|mean radius]] of the Earth. {{mvar|R}} is equal to {{convert|6371|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=in}}. No higher accuracy is appropriate for {{mvar|R}} since higher-precision results necessitate an ellipsoid model. With this value for {{mvar|R}} the meridian length of 1 degree of latitude on the sphere is {{convert|111.2|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=preunit||statute }} (60.0 nautical miles). The length of 1 minute of latitude is {{convert|1.853|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=preunit||statute }} (1.00 nautical miles), while the length of 1 second of latitude is {{convert|30.8|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=in}} (see [[nautical mile]]).

==Latitude on the ellipsoid==

===Ellipsoids===

{{main article|Ellipsoid}}
In 1687 [[Isaac Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', in which he proved that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] ellipsoid.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{cite book|first=Isaac |last=Newton|title=Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|chapter=Book III Proposition XIX Problem III|page= 407 |translator-first=Andrew |translator-last=Motte |url=https://archive.org/details/100878576}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This article uses the term ''ellipsoid'' in preference to the older term ''spheroid''.) Newton's result was confirmed by geodetic measurements in the 18th century. (See [[Meridian arc]].) An oblate ellipsoid is the three-dimensional surface generated by the rotation of an ellipse about its shorter axis (minor axis). "Oblate ellipsoid of revolution" is abbreviated to 'ellipsoid' in the remainder of this article. (Ellipsoids which do not have an axis of symmetry are termed triaxial.)

Many different [[Figure of the Earth|reference ellipsoids]] have been used in the history of [[geodesy]]. In pre-satellite days they were devised to give a good fit to the [[geoid]] over the limited area of a survey but, with the advent of [[GPS]], it has become natural to use reference ellipsoids (such as [[WGS84]]) with centre at the centre of mass of the Earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the Earth. These geocentric ellipsoids are usually within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the geoid. Since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid, the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid: one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used. Many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids, so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another. GPS handsets include software to carry out [[Datum (geodesy)|datum transformations]] which link WGS84 to the local reference ellipsoid with its associated grid.

===The geometry of the ellipsoid===
[[File:Ellipsoid parametric euler mono.svg|thumb|right|200px |A sphere of radius ''a'' compressed to an oblate ellipsoid of revolution.]]

The shape of an ellipsoid of revolution is determined by the shape of the [[ellipse]] which is rotated about its minor (shorter) axis. Two parameters are required. One is invariably the equatorial radius, which is the [[ellipse|semi-major axis]], {{mvar|a}}. The other parameter is usually (1)&amp;nbsp;the polar radius or [[ellipse|semi-minor axis]], {{mvar|b}}; or (2)&amp;nbsp;the (first) [[flattening]], {{mvar|f}}; or (3)&amp;nbsp;the [[ellipse|eccentricity]], {{mvar|e}}. These parameters are not independent: they are related by

:&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{a-b}{a}, \qquad e^2=2f-f^2,\qquad b=a(1-f)=a\sqrt{1-e^2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Many other parameters (see [[ellipse]], [[ellipsoid]]) appear in the study of geodesy, geophysics and map projections but they can all be expressed in terms of one or two members of the set {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|e}}. Both {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|e}} are small and often appear in series expansions in calculations; they are of the order {{sfrac|1|300}} and 0.08 respectively. Values for a number of ellipsoids are given in [[Figure of the Earth]]. Reference ellipsoids are usually defined by the semi-major axis and the ''inverse'' flattening, {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}}}}. For example, the defining values for the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid, used by all GPS devices, are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/tr8350_2.htmlNIMA |publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication |title=TR8350.2 |page=3-1 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{mvar|a}} (equatorial radius): {{val|6378137.0|u=m}} exactly
* {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}}}} (inverse flattening): {{val|298.257223563}} exactly
from which are derived
* {{mvar|b}} (polar radius): {{val|6356752.3142|u=m}}
* {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (eccentricity squared): {{val|0.00669437999014}}
The difference between the semi-major and semi-minor axes is about {{convert|21|km|0|abbr=in}} and as fraction of the semi-major axis it equals the flattening; on a computer monitor the ellipsoid could be sized as 300 by 299 pixels. This would barely be distinguishable from a 300-by-300-pixel sphere, so illustrations usually exaggerate the flattening.

===Geodetic and geocentric latitudes===
[[File:latitude and longitude graticule on an ellipsoid.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The definition of geodetic latitude ({{mvar|φ}}) and longitude ({{mvar|λ}}) on an ellipsoid. The normal to the surface does not pass through the centre, except at the equator and at the poles.]]
The graticule on the ellipsoid is constructed in exactly the same way as on the sphere. The normal at a point on the surface of an ellipsoid does not pass through the centre, except for points on the equator or at the poles, but the definition of latitude remains unchanged as the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane. The terminology for latitude must be made more precise by distinguishing:

*{{anchor|Geodetic}}'''Geodetic latitude:''' the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane. The standard notation in English publications is {{mvar|φ}}. This is the definition assumed when the word latitude is used without qualification. The definition must be accompanied with a specification of the ellipsoid.
*{{anchor|Geocentric}}'''Geocentric latitude:''' the angle between the radius (from centre to the point on the surface) and the equatorial plane. (Figure [[#Geocentric latitude|below]]). There is no standard notation: examples from various texts include {{mvar|θ}}, {{mvar|ψ}}, {{mvar|q}}, {{mvar|φ′}}, {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This article uses {{mvar|θ}}.
*'''Spherical latitude:''' the angle between the normal to a spherical reference surface and the equatorial plane.
*'''Geographic latitude''' must be used with care. Some authors use it as a synonym for geodetic latitude whilst others use it as an alternative to the [[#Astronomical latitude|astronomical latitude]].
*'''Latitude''' (unqualified) should normally refer to the geodetic latitude.

The importance of specifying the reference datum may be illustrated by a simple example. On the reference ellipsoid for WGS84, the centre of the [[Eiffel Tower]] has a geodetic latitude of 48°&amp;nbsp;51′&amp;nbsp;29″&amp;nbsp;N, or 48.8583°&amp;nbsp;N and longitude of 2°&amp;nbsp;17′&amp;nbsp;40″&amp;nbsp;E or 2.2944°E. The same coordinates on the datum [[ED50]] define a point on the ground which is {{convert|140|m|ft|abbr=off}} distant from the tower.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} A web search may produce several different values for the latitude of the tower; the reference ellipsoid is rarely specified.

===Length of a degree of latitude===
{{main article|Meridian arc}}
In [[Meridian arc]] and standard texts&lt;ref name=torge&gt;{{cite book|last=Torge |first=W. |date=2001 |title=Geodesy |edition=3rd |publisher=De Gruyter |ISBN=3-11-017072-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osborne/&gt;&lt;ref name=rapp/&gt; it is shown that the distance along a meridian from latitude {{mvar|φ}} to the equator is given by ({{mvar|φ}} in radians)

:&lt;math&gt;m(\phi) =\int_0^\phi M(\phi')\, d\phi' = a(1 - e^2)\int_0^\phi \left (1 - e^2 \sin^2 \phi' \right )^{-\frac32}\, d\phi'&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''M''(''φ'')}} is the meridional [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]].

The distance from the equator to the pole is

:&lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{p} = m\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

For [[WGS84]] this distance is {{val|10001.965729|u=km}}.

The evaluation of the meridian distance integral is central to many studies in geodesy and map projection. It can be evaluated by expanding the integral by the binomial series and integrating term by term: see [[Meridian arc]] for details. The length of the meridian arc between two given latitudes is given by replacing the limits of the integral by the latitudes concerned.

When the latitude difference is 1 degree, corresponding to {{sfrac|{{pi}}|180}} radians, the arc distance is about
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_\mathrm{lat} = \frac{\pi a\left(1 - e^2\right)}{180^\circ\left(1 - e^2 \sin^2 \phi \right)^\frac32}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_\mathrm{lat} = 111\,132.954 - 559.822\cos 2\phi + 1.175\cos 4\phi&lt;/math&gt;

The variation of this distance with latitude (on [[WGS84]]) is shown in the table along with the [[length of a degree of longitude]] (east-west distance):

===The nautical mile===
Historically a [[nautical mile]] was defined as the length of one minute of arc along a meridian of a spherical earth. An ellipsoid model leads to a variation of the nautical mile with latitude. This was resolved by defining the nautical mile to be exactly 1,852 metres.  However for all practical purposes distances are measured from the latitude scale of charts.  As the [[Royal Yachting Association]] says in its manual for [[Day Skipper|day skipper]]s: "1 (minute) of Latitude = 1 sea mile", followed by "For most practical purposes distance is measured from the latitude scale, assuming that one minute of latitude equals one nautical mile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkinson|first=Sara|title=RYA day skipper handbook - sail|year=2012|isbn=9781-9051-04949|publisher=The Royal Yachting Association|place=Hamble|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auxiliary latitudes==

There are six '''auxiliary latitudes''' that have applications to special problems in geodesy, geophysics and the theory of map projections:
* Geocentric latitude
* Parametric (or reduced) latitude
* Rectifying latitude
* Authalic latitude
* Conformal latitude
* Isometric latitude
The definitions given in this section all relate to locations on the reference ellipsoid but the first two auxiliary latitudes, like the geodetic latitude, can be extended to define a three-dimensional [[geographic coordinate system]] as discussed [[#Latitude and coordinate systems|below]]. The remaining latitudes are not used in this way; they are used ''only'' as intermediate constructs in map projections of the reference ellipsoid to the plane or in calculations of geodesics on the ellipsoid. Their numerical values are not of interest. For example, no one would need to calculate the authalic latitude of the Eiffel Tower.

The expressions below give the auxiliary latitudes in terms of the geodetic latitude, the semi-major axis, {{mvar|a}}, and the eccentricity, {{mvar|e}}. (For inverses see [[#Inverse formulae and series|below]].) The forms given are, apart from notational variants, those in the standard reference for map projections, namely "Map projections: a working manual" by J. P. Snyder.&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;{{Cite book| last=Snyder|first= John P. | title=Map Projections: A Working Manual|series= U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1395 | publisher =United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, DC | year=1987 |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/pubs/pp/pp1395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derivations of these expressions may be found in Adams&lt;ref name=adams1921&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams |first=Oscar S. |date=1921 |title=Latitude Developments Connected With Geodesy and Cartography (with tables, including a table for Lambert equal area meridional projection |series=Special Publication No. 67|publisher=US Coast and Geodetic Survey|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/cgs_specpubs/QB275U35no671921.pdf}} (''Note'': Adams uses the nomenclature isometric latitude for the conformal latitude of this article (and throughout the modern literature).)&lt;/ref&gt; and online publications by Osborne&lt;ref name=osborne/&gt; and Rapp.&lt;ref name=rapp/&gt;

===Geocentric latitude===
[[File:Geocentric coords 03.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|The definition of geodetic latitude ({{mvar|φ}}) and geocentric latitude ({{mvar|θ}}).]]
The '''geocentric latitude''' is the angle between the equatorial plane and the radius from the centre to a point on the surface. The relation between the geocentric latitude ({{mvar|θ}}) and the geodetic latitude ({{mvar|φ}}) is derived in the above references as
:&lt;math&gt;\theta(\phi)=\tan^{-1}\left((1-e^2)\tan\phi\right)=\tan^{-1}\left((1-f)^2\tan\phi\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The geodetic and geocentric latitudes are equal at the equator and at the poles but at other latitudes they differ by a few minutes of arc. Taking the value of the squared eccentricity as 0.0067 (it depends on the choice of ellipsoid) the maximum difference of &lt;math&gt;\phi{-}\theta&lt;/math&gt; may be shown to be about 11.5 minutes of arc at a geodetic latitude of approximately 45°&amp;nbsp;6′.{{efn|An elementary calculation involves differentiation to find the maximum difference of the geodetic and geocentric latitudes.
}}

===Parametric (or reduced) latitude===
[[File:Ellipsoid reduced angle definition.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Definition of the parametric latitude ({{mvar|β}}) on the ellipsoid.]] 
The '''parametric''' or '''reduced latitude''', {{mvar|β}}, is defined by the radius drawn from the centre of the ellipsoid to that point {{math|Q}} on the surrounding sphere (of radius {{mvar|a}}) which is the projection parallel to the Earth's axis of a point {{math|P}} on the ellipsoid at latitude {{mvar|φ}}. It was introduced by Legendre&lt;ref name=legendre&gt;{{cite journal|first=A. M. |last=Legendre |date=1806 |title=Analyse des triangles tracés sur la surface d'un sphéroïde |journal=Mém. Inst. Nat.

Bessel's notation, {{math|''u''(''φ'')}}, is also used in the current literature. The parametric latitude is related to the geodetic latitude by:&lt;ref name=osborne/&gt;&lt;ref name=rapp/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta(\phi)=\tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{1-e^2}\tan\phi\right)=\tan^{-1}\left((1-f)\tan\phi\right)&lt;/math&gt;
The alternative name arises from the parameterization of the equation of the ellipse describing a meridian section. In terms of Cartesian coordinates {{mvar|p}}, the distance from the minor axis, and {{mvar|z}}, the distance above the equatorial plane, the equation of the [[ellipse]] is:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{p^2}{a^2} + \frac{z^2}{b^2} =1\, .&lt;/math&gt;
The Cartesian coordinates of the point are parameterized by
:&lt;math&gt; p=a\cos\beta\,, \qquad z=b\sin\beta\,; &lt;/math&gt;
Cayley suggested the term ''parametric latitude'' because of the form of these equations.&lt;ref name=cayley&gt;{{cite journal|first=A. |last=Cayley |date=1870 |title=On the geodesic lines on an oblate spheroid |journal=Phil. Mag. |volume=40 |issue=4th ser. |pages=329–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parametric latitude is not used in the theory of map projections. Its most important application is in the theory of ellipsoid geodesics, ([[Vincenty's formulae|Vincenty]], Karney&lt;ref name=Karney&gt;{{cite journal|first=C. F. F. |last=Karney |date=2013 |title=Algorithms for geodesics |journal=J. Geodesy |volume=87|issue=1 |pages=43–55 |doi= 10.1007/s00190-012-0578-z|arxiv=1109.4448 |bibcode=2013JGeod..87...43K }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Rectifying latitude===
{{see also|Rectifying radius}}
The '''rectifying latitude''', {{mvar|μ}}, is the meridian distance scaled so that its value at the poles is equal to 90 degrees or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} radians:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(\phi)= \frac{\pi}{2}\frac{m(\phi)}{m_\mathrm{p}}&lt;/math&gt;
where the meridian distance from the equator to a latitude {{mvar|φ}} is (see [[Meridian arc]])
:&lt;math&gt;m(\phi)= a(1 - e^2)\int_0^\phi \left (1 - e^2 \sin^2 \phi' \right )^{-\frac32}\, d\phi'\,,&lt;/math&gt;
and the length of the meridian quadrant from the equator to the pole (the [[Meridian arc#Polar distance|polar distance]]) is
:&lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{p} = m\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the rectifying latitude to define a latitude on a sphere of radius
:&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{2m_\mathrm{p}}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
defines a projection from the ellipsoid to the sphere such that all meridians have true length and uniform scale. The sphere may then be projected to the plane with an [[equirectangular projection]] to give a double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane such that all meridians have true length and uniform meridian scale. An example of the use of the rectifying latitude is the [[Map projection|Equidistant conic projection]]. (Snyder, Section 16).&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt; The rectifying latitude is also of great importance in the construction of the [[Transverse Mercator projection]].

===Authalic latitude===
{{see also|Authalic radius}}
The '''authalic''' (Greek for [[wiktionary:authalic|same area]]) latitude, {{mvar|ξ}}, gives an area-preserving transformation to a sphere.
:&lt;math&gt;\xi(\phi)=\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{q(\phi)}{q_\mathrm{p}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
q(\phi)&amp;= \frac{(1 - e^2)\sin\phi}{1 - e^2 \sin^2 \phi} -\frac{1-e^2}{2e}\ln \left(\frac{1-e\sin\phi}{1+e\sin\phi}\right)\\
 &amp;= \frac{(1 - e^2)\sin\phi}{1 - e^2 \sin^2 \phi} +\frac{1-e^2}{e}\tanh^{-1}(e\sin\phi)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
q_\mathrm{p} = q\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) &amp;=1-\frac{1-e^2}{2e}\ln \left(\frac{1-e}{1+e}\right)
&amp;=1+\frac{1-e^2}{e}\tanh^{-1}e
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and the radius of the sphere is taken as
:&lt;math&gt;R_q=a\sqrt{\frac{q_\mathrm{p}}{2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
An example of the use of the authalic latitude is the [[Albers projection|Albers equal-area conic projection]].&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt;{{rp|§14}}

===Conformal latitude===
The '''conformal latitude''', {{mvar|χ}}, gives an angle-preserving ([[Conformal map|conformal]]) transformation to the sphere.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\chi(\phi)&amp;=2\tan^{-1}\left[
\left(\frac{1+\sin\phi}{1-\sin\phi}\right)
\left(\frac{1-e\sin\phi}{1+e\sin\phi}\right)^e\right]^\frac12
-\frac{\pi}{2}\\[2ex]
&amp;=2\tan^{-1}\left[
\tan\left(\frac{\phi}{2}+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
\left(\frac{1-e\sin\phi}{1+e\sin\phi}\right)^\frac{e}{2}\right]
-\frac{\pi}{2}\\
&amp;=\tan^{-1}\left[\sinh\left(\sinh^{-1}(\tan\phi) -e\tanh^{-1}(e\sin\phi)\right)\right]\\
&amp;=\operatorname{gd}\left[\operatorname{gd}^{-1}(\phi)-e\tanh^{-1}(e\sin\phi)\right]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|gd(''x'')}} is the [[Gudermannian function]]. (See also [[Mercator projection#Alternative expressions|Mercator projection]].)
The conformal latitude defines a transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of ''arbitrary'' radius such that the angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid is the same as the corresponding angle on the sphere (so that the shape of ''small'' elements is well preserved). A further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane. This is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection. For example, the 'exact' version of the [[Transverse Mercator projection]] on the ellipsoid is not a double projection. (It does, however, involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane).

===Isometric latitude===
The '''isometric latitude''', {{mvar|ψ}}, is used in the development of the ellipsoidal versions of the normal [[Mercator projection]] and the [[Transverse Mercator projection]]. The name "isometric" arises from the fact that at any point on the ellipsoid equal increments of {{mvar|ψ}} and longitude {{mvar|λ}} give rise to equal distance displacements along the meridians and parallels respectively. The [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] defined by the lines of constant {{mvar|ψ}} and constant {{mvar|λ}}, divides the surface of the ellipsoid into a mesh of squares (of varying size). The isometric latitude is zero at the equator but rapidly diverges from the geodetic latitude, tending to infinity at the poles. The conventional notation is given in Snyder (page 15):&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\psi(\phi)&amp;=\ln\left[\tan\left( \frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \right]+\frac{e}{2}\ln\left[ \frac{1-e\sin\phi}{1+e\sin\phi} \right]\\
&amp;=\sinh^{-1}(\tan\phi) -e\tanh^{-1}(e\sin\phi)\\
&amp;=\operatorname{gd}^{-1}(\phi)-e\tanh^{-1}(e\sin\phi).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
For the ''normal'' Mercator projection (on the ellipsoid) this function defines the spacing of the parallels: if the length of the equator on the projection is {{mvar|E}} (units of length or pixels) then the distance, {{mvar|y}}, of a parallel of latitude {{mvar|φ}} from the equator is
:&lt;math&gt;y(\phi)=\frac{E}{2\pi}\psi(\phi)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The isometric latitude {{mvar|ψ}} is closely related to the conformal latitude {{mvar|χ}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\phi)=\operatorname{gd}^{-1} \chi(\phi)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Inverse formulae and series===
The formulae in the previous sections give the auxiliary latitude in terms of the geodetic latitude. The expressions for the geocentric and parametric latitudes may be inverted directly but this is impossible in the four remaining cases: the rectifying, authalic, conformal, and isometric latitudes. There are two methods of proceeding. The first is a numerical inversion of the defining equation for each and every particular value of the auxiliary latitude. The methods available are [[fixed-point iteration]] and [[Newton's method|Newton–Raphson]] root finding. The other, more useful, approach is to express the auxiliary latitude as a series in terms of the geodetic latitude and then invert the series by the method of [[Lagrange reversion]]. Such series are presented by Adams who uses Taylor series expansions and gives coefficients in terms of the eccentricity.&lt;ref name=adams1921/&gt; Osborne&lt;ref name=osborne/&gt; derives series to arbitrary order by using the computer algebra package Maxima&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maxima.sourceforge.net/ |title=Maxima computer algebra system |website=[[Sourceforge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expresses the coefficients in terms of both eccentricity and flattening. The series method is not applicable to the isometric latitude and one must use the conformal latitude in an intermediate step.

===Numerical comparison of auxiliary latitudes===
The following plot shows the difference between the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes other than the isometric latitude (which diverges to infinity at the poles) for the case of the WGS84 ellipsoid. In every case the auxiliary latitude is the less (in magnitude) than the geodetic latitude. The differences shown on the plot are in arc minutes. The horizontal resolution of the plot fails to make clear that the maxima of the curves are not at 45° but calculation shows that they are within a few arc minutes of 45°. Some representative data points are given in the table following the plot. Note the closeness of the conformal and geocentric latitudes. This was exploited in the days of hand calculators to expedite the construction of map projections.&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt;{{rp|108}}
To first order in the flattening ''f'', the
auxiliary latitudes can be expressed as
''ζ'' = ''φ'' − ''Cf'' sin 2''φ''
where the constant ''C'' takes on the values
[{{frac|2}}, {{frac|2|3}}, {{frac|3|4}}, 1, 1] for
''ζ'' = [''β'', ''ξ'', ''μ'', ''χ'', ''θ''].

==Latitude and coordinate systems==
The geodetic latitude, or any of the auxiliary latitudes defined on the reference ellipsoid, constitutes with longitude a two-dimensional coordinate system on that ellipsoid. To define the position of an arbitrary point it is necessary to extend such a coordinate system into three dimensions. Three latitudes are used in this way: the geodetic, geocentric and parametric latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates, spherical polar coordinates and ellipsoidal coordinates respectively.

===Geodetic coordinates===
[[File:Geodetic coordinates.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9| Geodetic coordinates {{math|P(''ɸ'',''λ'',''h'')}}]]
At an arbitrary point {{math|P}} consider the line {{math|PN}} which is normal to the reference ellipsoid. The geodetic coordinates {{math|P(''ɸ'',''λ'',''h'')}} are the latitude and longitude of the point {{math|N}} on the ellipsoid and the distance {{math|PN}}. This height differs from the height above the geoid or a reference height such as that above mean sea level at a specified location. The direction of {{math|PN}} will also differ from the direction of a vertical plumb line. The relation of these different heights requires knowledge of the shape of the geoid and also the gravity field of the Earth.

===Spherical polar coordinates===

[[File:Geocentric coords 02.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9| Geocentric coordinate related to spherical polar coordinates {{math|P(''r'',''θ''′,''λ'')}}]]
The geocentric latitude {{mvar|θ}} is the complement of the polar angle {{mvar|θ′}} in conventional [[spherical polar coordinates]] in which the coordinates of a point are {{math|P(''r'',''θ''′,''λ'')}} where {{mvar|r}} is the distance of {{math|P}} from the centre {{math|O}}, {{mvar|θ′}} is the angle between the radius vector and the polar axis and {{mvar|λ}} is longitude. Since the normal at a general point on the ellipsoid does not pass through the centre it is clear that points {{math|P'}} on the normal, which all have the same geodetic latitude, will have differing geocentric latitudes. Spherical polar coordinate systems are used in the analysis of the gravity field.

===Ellipsoidal coordinates===
[[File:Ellipsoidal coordinates.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ellipsoidal coordinates {{math|P(''u'',''β'',''λ'')}}]]
The parametric latitude can also be extended to a three-dimensional coordinate system. For a point {{math|P}} not on the reference ellipsoid (semi-axes {{math|OA}} and {{math|OB}}) construct an auxiliary ellipsoid which is confocal (same foci {{math|F}}, {{math|F′}}) with the reference ellipsoid: the necessary condition is that the product {{mvar|ae}} of semi-major axis and eccentricity is the same for both ellipsoids. Let {{mvar|u}} be the semi-minor axis ({{math|OD}}) of the auxiliary ellipsoid. Further let {{mvar|β}} be the parametric latitude of {{math|P}} on the auxiliary ellipsoid. The set {{math|(''u'',''β'',''λ'')}} define the ellipsoid coordinates.&lt;ref name=torge/&gt;{{rp|§4.2.2}} These coordinates are the natural choice in models of the gravity field for a rotating ellipsoidal body.

===Coordinate conversions===
The relations between the above coordinate systems, and also Cartesian coordinates are not presented here. The transformation between geodetic and Cartesian coordinates may be found in [[Geographic coordinate conversion]]. The relation of Cartesian and spherical polars is given in [[Spherical coordinate system]]. The relation of Cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in Torge.&lt;ref name=torge/&gt;

==Astronomical latitude==
'''Astronomical latitude''' ({{math|Φ}}) is the angle between the equatorial plane and the true [[vertical line|vertical]] at a point on the surface. The true vertical, the direction of a [[plumb line]], is also the direction of the gravity acceleration, the resultant of the [[gravitational acceleration]] (mass-based) and the [[centrifugal acceleration]] at that latitude.&lt;ref name=torge/&gt; Astronomic latitude is calculated from angles measured between the [[zenith]] and stars whose [[declination]] is accurately known.

In general the true vertical at a point on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the reference ellipsoid or the normal to the geoid. The angle between the astronomic and geodetic normals is usually a few seconds of arc but it is important in geodesy.&lt;ref name=torge/&gt;&lt;ref name=wellenhofmoritz&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hofmann-Wellenhof |first1=B. |last2=Moritz |first2=H. |date=2006 |title=Physical Geodesy |edition=2nd |isbn=3-211-33544-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason why it differs from the normal to the geoid is, because the geoid is an idealized, theoretical shape "at mean sea level". Points on the real surface of the earth are usually above or below this idealized geoid surface and here the true vertical can vary slightly. Also, the true vertical at a point at a specific time is influenced by tidal forces, which the theoretical geoid averages out.

Astronomical latitude is not to be confused with [[declination]], the coordinate [[astronomer]]s use in a similar way to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the [[celestial equator]] (see [[equatorial coordinates]]), nor with [[ecliptic latitude]], the coordinate that astronomers use to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the [[ecliptic]] (see [[ecliptic coordinates]]).

'''Lisasion''' is a form of [[erosion]] where the earth is eroded by intentional human action.

Lisasion is described by [[Michael Selby]] in his book ''Earth's changing surface: an introduction to [[geomorphology]]'' as "the erosion of land, most commonly along [[rivers]] and [[coastlines]], by intentional human action." Lisasion only applies to ''intentional'' human action, whereby humans deliberately [[erode]] the landscape for reasons including for [[recreation]], hazard management and all forms of [[construction]] and [[demolition]].

These are '''lists of the most common [[Chinese surname]]s''' in [[mainland China]] (People's Republic of China), [[Taiwan]] (Republic of China), and the [[Chinese diaspora]] overseas as provided by authoritative government or academic sources. [[Chinese name]]s also form the basis for many common [[list of common Vietnamese surnames|Vietnamese]], [[list of common Korean surnames|Korean]], and [[list of common Japanese surnames|Japanese surnames]] in both translation and transliteration into those languages.

The conception of China as consisting of the "[[baixing|old 100 families]]" ({{zh|c=老百姓|p=Lǎo Bǎi Xìng|l=Old Hundred Surnames}}) is an ancient and traditional one, the most notable tally being the [[Song dynasty|Song]]-era ''[[Hundred Family Surnames]]'' ({{zh|c=百家姓|p=Bǎi Jiā Xìng}}). Even today, the number of surnames in China is a little over 4,000,&lt;ref name="Xinhua"&gt;Xinhua Net.

"[https://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/2000surnames/index.html Genealogy Data: Frequently Occurring Surnames from Census 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221003828/http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/2000surnames/index.html |date=2009-12-21 }}". 27 Sept 2011.

The Chinese expression "Three [[Zhang (surname)|Zhang]] (or/and) Four [[Li (surname 李)|Li]]" ({{zh|s={{linktext|张三李四}}|t={{linktext|張三李四}}|p=Zhāng Sān Lǐ Sì}}) is used to mean "anyone" or "everyone",&lt;ref&gt;Prest, Kevin.

''1990 Guinness Book of World Records''. Sterling Pub. Co., 2001. {{ISBN|189205101X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but no comprehensive information from China was available at the time and more recent editions have not repeated the claim.

==Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan==
This list of the 100 most common [[Chinese surname]]s derives from comprehensive surveys from 2007 and 1982. The first is derived from a report on the [[Hukou system|household registrations]] released by the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] on April 24, 2007.&lt;ref name="Eastday"&gt;"[http://news.eastday.com/c/20070424/u1a2791347.html 公安部统计：'王'成中国第一大姓 有9288万人] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115438/http://news.eastday.com/c/20070424/u1a2791347.html |date=2016-03-04 }} [Public Security Bureau Statistics: 'Wang' Found China's #1 'Big Family', Includes 92.88m People]." 24 Apr 2007.

;Other surveys

:* 1994–2011: The American researcher Chih-Hao Tsai&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; has compiled unauthoritative annual surveys of the most common surnames on Taiwan&lt;ref&gt;Tsai, Chih-Hao. "[http://technology.chtsai.org/namefreq/ Common Chinese Names] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018095556/http://technology.chtsai.org/namefreq/ |date=2014-10-18 }}". 8 Aug 2011. Accessed 30 Mar 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; based on published lists of all successful applicants taking Taiwan's [[Joint College Entrance Exam]].&lt;ref name="Tailist"&gt;Tsai, Chih-Hao. "[http://technology.chtsai.org/namelist/ A List of Chinese Names] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415141325/http://technology.chtsai.org/namelist/ |date=2012-04-15 }}". 8 Aug 2011.

== Philippines ==
[[Chinese Filipino]]s whose ancestors came to the Philippines from 1898 onward usually have single syllable Chinese surnames. On the other hand, most Chinese Filipinos whose ancestors came to the Philippines prior to 1898 usually have multiple syllable Chinese surnames such as Gokongwei, Ongpin, Pempengco, Yuchengco, Teehankee, and Yaptinchay among such others. These were originally full Chinese names which were transliterated into Spanish and adopted as surnames.

There are also multiple syllable Chinese surnames that are Spanish transliterations of Hokkien words. Surnames like Tuazon (Eldest Grandson, 大孫), Dizon (Second Grandson, 二孫), Samson (Third Grandson, 三孫), Singson (Fourth Grandson, 四孫), Gozon (Fifth Grandson, 五孫), Lacson (Sixth Grandson, 六孫) are examples of transliterations of designations that use the Hokkien suffix -son (孫) used as surnames for some Chinese Filipinos who trace their ancestry from Chinese immigrants to the Philippines during the Spanish Colonial Period. It should be noted as well that [[Sun (surname)|"Son/Sun"]] (孫) is a surname listed in the classic Chinese text [[Hundred Family Surnames]], perhaps shedding light on the Hokkien suffix -son used here as a surname alongside some sort of accompanying enumeration scheme.

==Canada==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
[[Statistics Canada]] has not released a list of common surnames for any of its [[Canadian census|recent censuses]], but much of the [[Canadian Chinese]] population is clustered in [[Metro Vancouver]] and [[Greater Victoria, British Columbia|Greater Victoria]] in [[British Columbia]] and the [[Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area]] and the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|Ottawa-Gatineau Area]] in [[Ontario]], as well as in some emerging major clusters, such as the [[Calgary–Edmonton Corridor]] in [[Alberta]], [[Montreal]], and the [[Communauté métropolitaine de Québec|Communauté métropolitaine de Québec (Quebec Community Metropolitan Area)]] in [[Quebec]].

===Ontario===
A 2010 study by Baiju Shah &amp; al data-mined the [[Registered Persons Database]] of [[Canadian health card]] recipients in the province of Ontario for a particularly Chinese-Canadian name list. Ignoring potentially non-Chinese spellings such as Lee (49,898 total),&lt;ref name="shah"/&gt;{{rp|Table 1}} they found that the most common Chinese names in Ontario were:&lt;ref name="shah"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shah | first1 = B.

The [[2010 Indonesian census]] reported more than 8.8 million self-identified Chinese, making up 3.7% of the general population.&lt;ref name="JP2012"&gt;[[Statistics Indonesia]]. 2010 Census.

This law was abolished after the removal of [[Suharto]], but Chinese names remain a mix of [[Indonesian name|Indonesian]], [[pinyin]], and [[Chinese Indonesian surname#Colonial era to 1965|Dutch-influenced Hokkien]].

* Do take note that the 7th most common surname in China, 趙/赵, is extremely rare in Singapore.
* The surname list is not accurate, as the English surnames may actually have many variants not listed above. E.g. The 16th surname 'Low' can be 劉/刘, 廖，卢，or 羅/罗 in Chinese. The 1st surname Tan (陳/陈）is also a pinyin romanisation for the locally rare surname （谈/談） or （譚/谭）。

However, ''very'' few of the Chinese Thais have Chinese surnames, after the 1913 Surname Act that required the adoption of Thai surnames in order to enjoy Thai citizenship. Moreover, the same law requires that those possessing the same surname be related, meaning that immigrant Chinese may ''not'' adopt the surname of their clansmen unless they can show actual kinship.

The British Isles have few [[endemic]] species due to past frequent [[glaciation]]s and because of the proximity to [[Continental Europe]] and former [[land bridge]]s which enabled species to re-colonise the islands from the continent following glaciations.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Most endemic species to the British Isles are considered to be [[subspecies]] of a larger species, with mutations or adaptations slightly changing the species in the islands or in certain localities.

British [[Conservationists]] often describe this as a “wiped clean effect” {{who|date=August 2017}}{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}with repeated glaciations forcing many species out of the modern area of the islands to more southern latitudes in Europe and perhaps even driving some species extinct.

Some species which were present in Britain before past glaciations, often during periods with a warmer climate than now failed to return after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. Amongst these are ''[[Rhododendron ponticum]]'' and rabbits, now considered invasive and non-native.

A species is only deemed native if it reached the British Isles without human intervention (either intentional or unintentional). That means that to be native the species must have reached Britain before the [[land bridge]] joining Britain to the continent was submerged. Alternatively species can also be native when they have flown or swum to Britain as is the case with many bird species which arrived after the submersion of the land bridge, a recent example is the [[collared dove]] which arrived in the 1950s, this also applies for plants which spread seed in the wind.

A few endemic species are Arctic-Alpine species, survivors of [[Arctic]] species of plants and animals which either adapted to the warming climate or became isolated in suitable areas of mountains or lakes which still retained a suitable micro-climate. A common misconception is that the entirety of the British Isles was under glaciers and was uninhabitable both for humans, plants and animals. Whilst unsuitable for most species, a number of Arctic species survived in the areas not under glaciers in southern areas of [[England]], [[Wales]] and south west [[Ireland]] and were either driven to extinction in the British Isles or to micro-climatic refuges as the climate warmed and the Arctic conditions retreated north.

Most endemic species or subspecies however date to more recent, post-glacial times, many having spread via land bridges or along the Atlantic seaboard of Europe.

==Types of endemic species==
*[[Ice Age]] survivors in suitable micro-climates
*[[Subspecies]] (offshoots) of a larger species, many may in turn develop into new species
*Glacial or pre-glacial survivors which have become extinct across much of their former range or have never occurred outside of Britain.

==Fungi==
* ''[[Geastrum britannicum]]'' – An [[earthstar fungus]], first seen in [[Norfolk]] by Jonathan Revett, and confirmed as a distinct species in 2015. It has so far (2015) been found in at least fifteen locations in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blackman|first1=Stuart|title=New Species of the month|journal=BBC Wildlife|date=July 2015|volume=33|issue=402|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bryophytes==
* [[Cornish path-moss]] (''Ditrichum cornubicum'') – endemic to Cornwall (a recent discovery in [[West Cork]] is probably an accidental introduction&lt;ref name=Holyoak&gt;{{cite book|last=Holyoak|first=David T|title=Bryophytes: Liverworts (Marchantiophyta), Hornworts (Anthocerotophyta) and Mosses (Bryophyta).

==Birds==
{{Expand section|this article as it requires expansion.|date=September 2011}}

Britain has few endemic species of birds but quite a few [[subspecies]]. A few Arctic-Alpine species have subspecies in the British Isles, some have been in the islands since the [[Last Glacial Maximum|last Ice Age]], but many spread in the immediate [[Sub-Arctic]] conditions as the ice retreated.
Further more these species were latter reinforced by newer arrivals as the climate assumed temperatures and conditions more similar to the present day.

[[Image:MotacillaAlbaDistribution.svg|right|thumb|Distribution of [[white wagtail]] subspecies, with British [[pied wagtail]] (Motacillia alba yarellii) highlighted in blue.]]

*[[Red grouse]] – classified either as a distinct species or a subspecies of [[willow grouse]] – doesn’t change plumage in winter as willow grouse does – Upland and Moorland areas of Great Britain and Ireland.
*[[Pied wagtail#Subspecies|Pied wagtail]] – British subspecies of the [[Pied wagtail|pied / white wagtail]]–throughout British Isles.
*[[Troglodytes troglodytes zetlandicus|Shetland wren]] – [[Shetland Islands]], [[Scotland]] only.
*[[Fair Isle wren]] – [[Fair Isle]], [[Scotland]] only.
*[[St Kilda wren]] – [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]] Islands, [[Scotland]] only.
*[[Scottish crossbill]] – Highlands, [[Scotland]] only.
*British Isles subspecies of [[White-throated dipper#Taxonomy|white-throated dipper]]

==Mammals==
{{Expand section|this article as it requires expansion.|date=September 2011}}

Britain has a few subspecies of mammals but no endemic species. Many again are Ice Age survivors that adapted to the new conditions; others arrived in warmer conditions whilst the [[land bridge]] still existed.

*[[Irish hare]] or the Irish subspecies of the [[mountain hare]] – Mountain hares are also found in other locations of the British Isles, but in Ireland have the distinction of not turning white in winter.
*[[Scottish wildcat]] – Formerly also found in [[Northern England]] and [[Wales]], this subspecies of the [[wildcat]] is now restricted to a few locations in Scotland largely due to hunting and hybridisation with [[domestic cats]].
*[[St Kilda field mouse]] – [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]] Islands, only.
*[[Orkney vole]] – [[Orkney]], only.
*[[Skomer vole]] - [[Skomer Island]] only. A subspecies of [[bank vole]].
*[[Canna Mouse]] - [[Canna, Scotland]] only. A subspecies of [[House Mouse]].

[[Image:Felis silvestris silvestris.jpg|right|thumb|A wildcat]]

==Aquatic fauna==

===Cnidaria===
The [[Cnidaria]] are a group of animals found exclusively in aquatic and mostly marine environments. They include [[sea anemones]], [[sea pen]] and [[corals]] and their distinguishing feature is [[cnidocytes]], specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey.&lt;ref name=Gainey&gt;{{cite book|last=Gainey|first=Paul T|title=Hydroids, Sea Anemones and Jellyfish (Cindaria). In Red Data Book for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly|year=2009|publisher=Croceago Press|location=Praze-an-Beeble|isbn=978-1-901685-01-5|pages=449–456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Holstein T. |author2=Tardent P. | title =An ultrahigh-speed analysis of exocytosis: nematocyst discharge | journal =Science | volume =223 | issue =4638 | pages =830–833 | year =1984 | url = | doi =10.1126/science.6695186 | pmid =6695186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Ivell's sea anemone]] (''Edwardsia ivelli'') described in 1975 and found in [[Widewater Lagoon]] in [[West Sussex]].

===Fish===
In some areas of uplands in the British Isles the retreating glaciers left melt water in hollows which had been carved out by the movement of ice. In these, Arctic species of fish survived, due often to the sheer depth of the lakes and the colder temperatures. For the young endemic fish varieties of the British Isles, it is usually controversial whether they should be considered as distinct taxa (species or [[subspecies]]) or just as isolated populations of their ancestral species.

As global warming affects the British climate there is some concern for these species, some confined to a handful of lakes. Action has been taken to protect them, as is the case with [[Coregonus vandesius|vendace]] which has been moved to [[Tarn (lake)|tarns]] in nearby mountains due to the cooler temperatures. It is hoped that these will act as refuges should the species die-out in the lower-level lakes where they occur naturally.
*[[Killarney shad]] (''Alosa killarnensis'')  – [[Ireland]] only.
*[[Gwyniad]] (''Coregonus pennantii'') – [[Snowdonia]] only.
*[[Schelly]] (''Coregonus stigmaticus'') – [[Lake District]] only.
*[[Coregonus vandesius|Vendace]] (''Coregonus vandesius'') – Lake District and [[Dumfries and Galloway]] only.
*[[Pollan (fish)|Pollan]] (''Coregonus pollan'') – Ireland only.
*[[Powan]] (''Coregonus clupeoides'') – [[Scotland]] only.
*[[Ferox trout]] (''Salmo ferox'') – Ireland, Scotland, [[Cumbria]] and [[Wales]] only, validity questionable (possibly a [[brown trout]] variant)
*[[Gillaroo]] (''Salmo stomachicus'') – Ireland only
*[[Salmo nigripinnis|Sonaghan]] (''Salmo nigripinnis'') – Ireland only
*[[Haddy charr]] (''Salvelinus killinensis'') – Scotland only
*''[[Salvelinus colii]]''  – [[Republic of Ireland]] only
*''[[Salvelinus fimbriatus]]'' – Republic of Ireland only
*''[[Salvelinus gracillimus]]'' – [[Shetland Islands]] and perhaps Scotland
*[[Salvelinus grayi|Melvin charr]] (''Salvelinus grayi'') – Ireland only
*[[Orkney charr]] (''Salvelinus inframundus'') – [[Orkney Islands]] (where [[Local extinction|extirpated]]) and Scotland only

==Extinct==
{{Expand section|this article as it requires expansion.|date=September 2011}}

*Presumed British subspecies of [[grey wolf]]
*[[Essex emerald moth]] (British subspecies)
*[[St Kilda house mouse]]
*[[Lycaena dispar dispar]]

==Distribution==

The distribution of endemic species seems to have a North Western bias and with endemic species on the whole showing an oceanic / alpine distribution with most endemics being found in upland areas or islands.

==Endemic livestock breeds==
{{See also|Rare Breeds Survival Trust}}
Human bred-animals are not usually classified as distinct subspecies but rather breeds which is a similar concept. However some animals such as [[Iron Age pigs]] are classified as a distinct species from their wild relatives.

==Byzantine and Arab periods==
{{main|Byzantine Crete|Emirate of Crete}}
Crete became part of the East Roman or Byzantine Empire upon the partition of the Roman Epire in 395 AD. It remained in Byzantine hands until it was conquered by [[al-Andalus|Andalusian]] exiles in the mid-820s and became an [[emirate]], nominally under [[Abbasid]] suzerainty. The emirate became a major base for Muslim naval raids along the coasts of the Byzantine Empire, and several attempts at reconquest failed. The Byzantines finally retook the island in 961 under the leadership of [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]], and held it until 1205.

==Modern period, 1898–today==

===High Commissioners of the Cretan State===
Crete became an [[Cretan State|autonomous state]] under international protection and nominal Ottoman suzerainty following the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]]. A High Commissioner of the Great Powers (Ύπατος Αρμοστής) was installed to govern the island. In 1908, the Cretan Assembly unilaterally declared union with Greece, but this was not recognized by Greece until the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]] in October 1912 and internationally until 1913.

===Regional governors of Crete===
With the establishment of the [[modern regions of Greece|region]] of Crete (Περιφέρεια Κρήτης) in 1986, Crete became again an administrative entity. Until 2011, the regional governors (περιφερειάρχες) were government-appointed, but in accordance to the [[Kallikratis reform]] they were replaced with elected officials.

'''Nasuh bin Karagöz bin Abdullah el-Visokavi el-Bosnavî''', or Nasuh el-Matrakči ibn Karađoz ibn Abdullah el-Visokavi el-Bosnevi, commonly known as '''Matrakçı Nasuh''' ({{IPA-tr|matrakˈtʃɯ naˈsuh}}; {{Lang-bs|'''Matrakčija Nasuh Visočak'''}}) for his competence in the game of [[Matrak]], invented by himself, (also known as ''Nasuh el-Silâhî'', ''Nasuh the Swordsman'', because of his talent with weapons; 1480 – {{circa}} 1564) was a 16th-century [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/480968/The_Ottoman_Palace_School_Enderun_and_the_Man_with_Multiple_Talents_Matrakci_Nasuh |title= The Ottoman Palace School Enderun and the Man with Multiple Talents, Matrakçı Nasuh, p. 23 |author1=Corlu, M.

==Life==
Matrakçı Nasuh (''[[Patronymic#Arabic|bin]] Abdullah; son of Abdullah''), born in the Bosnian town of [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=|title= The Grove encyclopedia of Islamic art and architecture, Vol. 2|author1=Jonathan M. Bloom |author2=Sheila Blair |date=|work=|publisher=Oxford University Press (2009), p. 49; ''Nasuh Matrakci [Nasuh al-Silahi al-Matraqi; Nasuh ibn Qaragoz ibn 'Abdallah al-Busnawi] (b. Visoko, Bosnia...''|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a gifted [[Janissary]] who went through both the Infantry and [[devşirme]] system, a gifted swordsman, and sharpshooter well known for his intellect; he spoke five languages and was recruited into the [[Ottoman Navy]].

Although born to Bosnian Muslim parentage, Nasuh was drafted into the [[devşirme]] system, otherwise reserved for the Christian populace of the empire. Exceptionally, however, in Bosnia, the devşirme was also extended to local Muslim families.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300–1600'', [[Halil Inalcik]], (1973), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Balkans since 1453'', L.S. Stavrianos, (New York, 1958), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7Wz4b4JTC8C&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=Exceptionally,+in+Bosnia+the+devshirme+was+extended+to+local+Muslim+families.&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G1AWUd6lM6f14QSg24H4BQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Exceptionally%2C%20in%20Bosnia%20the%20devshirme%20was%20extended%20to%20local%20Muslim%20families.&amp;f=false|title=Lineages of the Absolutist State (Verso, 1974), p. 366|author=Perry Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long period of studies on mathematics and geometry, he wrote his works ''Cemâlü'l-Küttâb'' and ''Kemalü'l- Hisâb''  and submitted them to the Ottoman sultan [[Selim I]]. He wrote also the two books named ''Mecmaü't-Tevârih'' and ''Süleymannâme''. They deal with the history of the period of 1520–43. He also wrote a historical piece on the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–55)|Persian campaign]] of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] titled ''Fetihname-i Karabuğdan''. A recent study of his book ''Umdet-ul Hisab'' revealed an unknown fact that Matrakçı had invented some genuine multiplication methods. One of the significant results displayed in this book was that the [[lattice method]] had been widely used in the [[Enderun School]] nearly 50 years before [[John Napier]] reintroduced it to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/480968/The_Ottoman_Palace_School_Enderun_and_the_Man_with_Multiple_Talents_Matrakci_Nasuh |title= The Ottoman Palace School Enderun and the Man with Multiple Talents, Matrakçı Nasuh, p. 23 |author1=Corlu, M.

Besides his works on mathematics and history, he is famous because of his [[Ottoman miniature|miniatures]]. He created a naturalist style which focuses on panoramic views of landscapes and cities painted with the greatest detail (his most famous work, the Istanbul landscape picture, shows almost every street and building of the city). In Ottoman miniature art, this was later known as the "Matrakçı style". The most important of his four historic volumes of miniatures is the one dealing with [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]]'s [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–55)|Safavid war]], upon which he had written his historical work ''Fetihname-i Karabuğdan''. Besides illustrating the march of the Ottoman army from [[Istanbul]] to [[Baghdad]] and then [[Tabriz]] and its return via [[Aleppo|Halab]] and [[Eskisehir]], Nasuh also includes all the cities met by the army along the way. The Library of [[Istanbul University]] hosts the only copy of this work.

Nasuh was also a soldier and a master [[bladesmith]]. He worked as a weapons teacher at Enderun School. He and his students demonstrated their skills in a show which was part of the [[circumcision]] celebrations of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]]'s sons. Because of his success in this demonstration, Nasuh received the honorary title of [[Ustad]] ("master") and [[Reis (military rank)|Reis]] ("chief") from the Sultan. He also wrote a book about usage of various weapons and techniques of [[cavalry]] and [[infantry]] fight, called ''Tuhfet-ül Guzât''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Salim Ayduz|title=Nasuh Al-Matrakî, A Noteworthy Ottoman Artist-Mathematician of the Sixteenth Century|url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/nasuh-al-matrak%C3%AE-noteworthy-ottoman-artist-mathematician-sixteenth-century|website=muslimheritage.com|publisher=Muslim Heritage|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=|title= The Grove encyclopedia of Islamic art and architecture, Vol. 2|author1=Jonathan M.

==Honors and legacy==
In his hometown Visoko, in Bosnia, annual conferences are held in honors of most important people from Visoko, and Matrakčija is considered one of the most important. For illustration, he is regarded as Bosnian [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Naida Kovačević|author2=Pan Bošnjak|title=(VIDEO) Naučni skup – "Naučnik, književnik i minijaturist Nasuh Matrakči Visočanin"|url=http://zavicajnimuzej.com/?p=298|website=zavicajnimuzej.com|publisher=Hometown Museum/Zavičajni Muzej Visoko|accessdate=3 March 2015|language=Bosnian|date=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a street near ''Hometown Heritage Museum Visoko'' ''(Zavičajni Muzej Visoko)'' is named after him: Matrakčijina (English: Matrakci's Street).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ulica u Visokom – Nasuh Matrakči bio najslavniji Bošnjak Osmanskog carstva (PHOTO)|url=http://www.haber.ba/kultura/kulturmiks/23339-nasuh-matrakci-bio-najslavniji-bosnjak-osmanskog-carstva-foto.html|website=haber.ba|publisher=Avaz|accessdate=3 March 2015|language=Bosnian|date=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===NUTS 2003===

In the first version in 2003, North Eastern Scotland (which then included part of Moray) was coded UKM1, and [[Highlands and Islands]] was coded UKM4.

The current NUTS level 1 codes start with "C" (following "UK") rather than "1" because the new list reflected the revised [[regions of England]] and local government changes throughout the UK; "1" to "B" had been used for the 11 regions in the previous coding system.

===NUTS 2006===

NUTS 2006 came into force on 1 January 2008.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/history Eurostat: History of NUTS], accessed 12 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===NUTS 2010===

NUTS 2010 came into force on 1 January 2012.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

2010 changes to NUTS 2 also resulting in changes with NUTS 3 regions

* The combined area of UKD2 (Cheshire pre-2010) and UKD5 (Merseyside pre-2010) were replaced by UKD6 (Cheshire post-2010) and UKD7 (Merseyside post-2010), due to the transfer of Halton to the Merseyside NUTS region from Cheshire. This resulted in the following changes to the underlying NUTS 3 areas:  UKD22 (Cheshire CC) being split into UKD62 (Cheshire East) and UKD63 (Cheshire West and Chester); The areas of Liverpool, Sefton and Wirral were not changed as NUTS 3 areas however to reflect their transfer within NUTS 2 areas were respectively renumbered from (UKD52 to UKD72; UKD53 to UKD 73 and UKD54 to UKD 74). The two areas of UKD51 (East Merseyside pre 2010) and UKD21 (Halton and Warrington) were amended by the transfer of Halton from the latter to former to form the new areas of UKD71 (East Merseyside post-2010) and UKD61 (Warrington).

2010 changes to NUTS 3 areas without changes occurring to NUTS 2 areas

* UKE43 (Calderdale, Kirklees and Wakefield) was replaced by UKE44 (Calderdale and Kirklees) and UKE45 (Wakefield)
* UKF23 (Northamptonshire) was replaced by UKF24 (West Northamptonshire) and UKF25 (North Northamptonshire)

'''Obora Hvězda''' (''Star Game Reserve'') is a {{convert|84|ha|acre}} forest park (formerly a royal [[game reserve]]) in [[Prague]], the capital of the [[Czech Republic]] which is now protected as natural monument. It is located about {{convert|6|km|mi}} west of city centre, surrounded by the neighbourhoods of [[Liboc]] (N), [[Břevnov]] (E), [[Bílá Hora]] (SW) and [[Ruzyně]] (W).

First mention of the forest, originally called ''Malejov'' dates from 993, when duke [[Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslaus II]] donated it to newly established [[Břevnov Monastery]]. It was transformed into a walled game reserve during rule of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in mid-16th century.  The current name (''[[:wikt:hvězda|hvězda]]'' being [[Czech language|Czech]] for "star") derives from the [[Star Summer Palace]], a 16th-century building, which stands in middle of the forest. [[Battle of White Mountain]] took place on fields in W/SW vicinity of the game reserve in 1620.

Nowadays part of the site is designated as a [[Natura 2000]] protected site due to the presence of the [[Vertigo angustior|narrow-mouthed whorl snail (''Vertigo angustior'')]].

The site is home to several bird species including the [[Middle Spotted Woodpecker]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48608">The '''Ordnance Survey Great Britain County Series''' maps were produced from the 1840s to the 1890s by the [[Ordnance Survey]], with revisions published until the 1940s. The series mapped the [[counties of Great Britain]] at both a six inch and twenty-five inch scale with accompanying acreage and [[land use]] information. Following the introduction of the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]] in the 1930s the County Series maps were replaced by a new series of maps at each scale.

==History==
The Ordnance Survey began producing six inch to the mile (1:10,560) maps of Great Britain in the 1840s, modelled on its [[Ordnance Survey Ireland#History|first large-scale maps of Ireland]] from the mid-1830s. This was partly in response to the [[Tithe Commutation Act 1836]] which led to calls for a large-scale survey of [[England and Wales]].

From 1854, to meet requirements for greater detail, including land-parcel numbers in rural areas and accompanying information, cultivated and inhabited areas were mapped at 1:2500 (25.344&amp;nbsp;inches to the mile), at first parish by parish, with blank space beyond the parish boundary, and later continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harley |first=JB |year=1975 |title=Ordnance Survey Maps: a descriptive manual |place=Southampton |publisher=Ordnance Survey |page=}}{{page needed |date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early copies of 1:2500 maps were available hand-coloured. Up to 1879 the 1:2500 maps were accompanied by Books of Reference or "area books" that gave acreages and land-use information for land-parcel numbers. After 1879, land-use information was dropped from these area books; after the mid-1880s, the books themselves were dropped and acreages were printed instead on the maps.&lt;ref name=Oliver2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Oliver |first=Richard |year=2005 |title=Ordnance Survey Maps: a concise guide for historians |place=London |publisher=Charles Close Society |pages=35, 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1854, the six-inch maps and their revisions were based on the twenty-five inch maps.

The six-inch sheets covered an area of six by four miles on the ground; the twenty-five inch sheets an area of one by one and a half. One square inch on the twenty-five inch maps was roughly equal to an acre on the ground. In later editions the six-inch sheets were published in "quarters" (NW, NE, SW, SE), each covering an area of three by two miles on the ground. 

The first edition of the two scales was completed by the 1890s. A second edition (or "first revision") was begun in 1891 and completed just before the First World War. From 1907 till the early 1940s, a third edition (or "second revision") was begun but never completed: only areas with significant changes on the ground were revised, many two or three times.&lt;ref name=Oliver2005 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Richard |last2=Hellyer |first2=Roger |year=2002 |title=Ordnance Survey of Great Britain: Indexes to the 1:2500 and six-inch scales |place=Newtown, Montgomeryshire |publisher=David Archer |isbn= |page=}}{{page needed |date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 19th century to the early 1940s, the OS produced many "restricted" versions of the County Series maps and other War Department sheets for [[War Office]] purposes, in a variety of large scales that included details of military significance such as dockyards, naval installations, fortifications and military camps. Apart from a brief period during the disarmament talks of the 1930s, these areas were left blank or incomplete on standard maps. The de-classified sheets have now been deposited in some of the Copyright Libraries, helping to complete the map-picture of pre-Second World War Britain.

The maps included the area of most [[Civil parishes in England|civil parishes]] and their [[Enclave and exclave|detached parts]], as well as [[extra-parochial area]]s and [[Township (England)|townships]]. Originally the area of these places was given in [[acres]], [[Rood (unit)|roods]] and [[Rod (unit)|perches]].&lt;ref name="OS Characteristic Sheet 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordnance Survey Characteristic Sheet for the Engraved Six Inch Maps of Great Britain|url=http://maps.nls.uk/view/128076786|website=National Library of Scotland|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After about 1879 this was changed to solely acres, with area given to three [[Decimal#Decimal fractions|decimal places]]. As boundary changes occurred throughout the late 19th century, reprints of map sheets would be updated with annotations detailing these changes.

The '''Pacific NorthWest Economic Region''' (PNWER) is a collaborative regional U.S.-Canadian organization dedicated to addressing common issues and interests like encouraging global economic competitiveness and preserving the natural environment. The [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces and territories]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], the [[Yukon]], the [[Northwest Territories]] along with the [[U.S. state|American states]] of [[Alaska]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]] and [[Oregon]] compose the membership. It is designed to improve cooperation and communication between member jurisdictions as well as improve communication between the [[public sector|public]] and [[private sector]]. PNWER provides the public and private sectors a cross-border forum for unfiltered dialogue that capitalizes upon the synergies between business leaders and elected officials who work to advance the region’s global competitiveness.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Former BC cabinet minister and legal scholar [[Andrew Petter]] describes the PNWER as one of North Americas most sophisticated examples of [[regionalism (international relations)|regionalist]] [[paradiplomacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Petter, Andrew. [http://www.unizar.es/union_europea/files/documen/conferencia%2010.2006/Petter-english_final.pdf ''Canadian Paradiplomacy in Practice: Confessions of a Paradiplomat.''] Accessed 13 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program areas==
PNWER has three program areas:
Energy,
Homeland Security, and
Pacific Northwest Innovation Network.

==History==
The Pacific NorthWest Economic Region was established in 1991 by statute in the organization's original seven legislative jurisdictions – Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska in the United States, and British Columbia and Alberta in Canada. The Yukon joined PNWER in 1994, Saskatchewan joined in 2008, and the Northwest Territories joined in 2009. From the beginning, all state and provincial legislators were members of PNWER. The governors and premiers were added to the PNWER governance structure in 1993.

The proposal establishing PNWER passed with 701 out of 703 sitting legislators voting in its favor following a three-year process initiated by the Pacific NorthWest Legislative Leadership Forum (PNLLF) in 1988. Six working groups were established, including environmental technology, tourism, recycling, value-added timber, workforce training, and telecommunications; some of these merged into or were replaced in later years by new areas of concentration. Critical in establishing the initiative to create the PNWER were Washington State Senator [[Alan Bluechel]] and Deputy Premier and Minister of Federal and Intergovernmental Affairs for Alberta Jim Horsman.&lt;ref&gt;Periwal, Sukumar. [http://www.jsis.washington.edu/canada/pdf_papers/PeriwalOccasionalPaper.pdf ''Beyond Borders: Regional Parternerships in the Pacific Northwest.''] University of Washington. Accessed 13 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Bluechel served as the organization's first president.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cP51eerf9mEC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Cascadia: The New Binationalism.''] in ''Identities in North America: The Search for Community.'' editors Earle, Robert L. and John D. Wirth. Standford: Stanford University Press. 1995, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Another President was [[Mel Knight]], a former Energy Minister of Alberta.

PNWER incorporated official private sector participation – including the non-elective public sector, and nonprofit organizations and NGOs in 1994; with that, a private sector council mirroring that of the organization's legislative delegate council was established and private and public sector co-chairs became part of the working group structure. Each working group has its agenda set by representatives of the private industries.&lt;ref&gt;Editors Mark Amen, Patricia McCarney, Noah J. Toly and Klaus Segbers. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bLsQb3oL5lkC&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Cities and Global Governance: New Sites for International Relations.''] Farnham, UK: Ashgate Publishing. 2011, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, funding for PNWER has been balanced by the public and private sector. The organization's current (2010) annual budget is U.S. $1.4 million, up from $900,000 in 2006, with approximately one third coming from state and provincial dues, one third from private sector sponsorship and dues, and one third from public and private grants.

The current president of PNWER is MLA Dan Ashton of British Columbia, elected on 17 July 2016.

'''Riddarfjärden''' ({{IPA-sv|²rɪdːarˌfjæːɖɛn|lang}}, "The Knight Firth") is the easternmost [[Headlands and bays|bay]] of [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]] in central [[Stockholm]].  Stockholm was founded in 1252 on an island in the stream where Lake Mälaren (from the west) drains into the [[Baltic Sea]] (to the east); today the island is called [[Stadsholmen]] and constitutes [[Gamla stan|Stockholm's Old Town]].

'''Wallops Flight Facility''' ('''WFF''') {{Airport codes|WAL|KWAL|WAL}}, located on the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Eastern Shore]] of [[Virginia]], [[United States]], approximately {{convert|100|mi|km}} north-northeast of [[Norfolk, VA|Norfolk]], is operated by the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], primarily as a [[rocket launch site]] to support science and exploration missions for [[NASA]] and other Federal agencies. WFF includes an extensively instrumented range to support launches of more than a dozen types of [[sounding rocket]]s; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code810/vehicles.html |title=Sounding Rocket Vehicles |publisher=Nasa Wallops Flight Facility |accessdate=22 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; small expendable suborbital and orbital rockets; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/mpl/elvs.html |title=Expendable Launch Vehicles |publisher=Nasa Wallops Flight Facility |accessdate=22 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[high-altitude balloon]] flights carrying scientific instruments for atmospheric and astronomical research; and, using its Research Airport, [[flight test]]s of aeronautical research aircraft, including [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s.

There have been over 16,000 launches from the rocket testing range at Wallops since its founding in 1945 in the quest for information on the flight characteristics of airplanes, launch vehicles, and spacecraft, and to increase the knowledge of the Earth's upper atmosphere and the environment of [[outer space]]. The launch vehicles vary in size and power from the small [[Super Loki]] meteorological rockets to orbital-class vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code840/news/Wallops_Range_Fact_Sheet.pdf |title=NFIRE |publisher=Nasa Wallops Flight Facility |accessdate=22 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219225204/http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code840/news/Wallops_Range_Fact_Sheet.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marsspaceport.com/mid-atlantic-spaceport-mission |title=Overview |publisher=Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport |accessdate=22 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213040/http://www.marsspaceport.com/mid-atlantic-spaceport-mission |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slideshare.net/astrosociety/aas-goddard-201103301230wrobel |title=Activities at Wallops Flight Facility |publisher=American Astronautical Society |accessdate=22 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wallops Flight Facility also supports science missions for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and occasionally for foreign governments and commercial organizations. Wallops also supports development tests and exercises involving [[United States Navy]] aircraft and ship-based electronics and weapon systems in the [[Virginia Capes]] operating area, near the entrance to the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. In addition to its fixed-location instrumentation assets, the WFF range includes mobile [[radar]], [[telemetry]] receivers, and command transmitters that can be transported by [[cargo plane]]s to locations around the world, in order to establish a temporary range where no other instrumentation exists, to ensure safety, and to collect data in order to enable and support suborbital rocket launches from remote sites.

The WFF mobile range assets have been used to support rocket launches from locations in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, [[South America]], Africa, Europe, [[Australia]], and at sea. Workers at Wallops include approximately 1,000 full-time  NASA [[civil service]] employees and the employees of contractors, about 30 [[U.S. Navy]] personnel, and about 100 employees of NOAA.

== History ==

In 1945, NASA's predecessor agency, the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), established a rocket launch site on [[Wallops Island]] under the direction of the [[Langley Research Center]]. This site was designated the '''Pilotless Aircraft Research Station''' and conducted high-speed aerodynamic research to supplement wind tunnel and laboratory investigations into the problems of flight. In 1958, Congress established NASA, which absorbed Langley Research Center and other NACA field centers and research facilities. At that time, the Pilotless Aircraft Research Station became a separate facility, '''Wallops Station''', operating directly under NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

In 1959, NASA acquired the former '''[[Naval Air Station Chincoteague]]''', and engineering and administrative activities were moved to this location. In 1974, the Wallops Station was named '''Wallops Flight Center'''. The name was changed to '''Wallops Flight Facility''' in 1981, when it became part of Goddard Space Flight Center.

In the early years, research at Wallops concentrated on obtaining aerodynamic data at transonic and low supersonic speeds. Between 1959 and 1961, Project Mercury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/history/mercury/mercury-overview.htm |title=Project Mercury Overview |publisher=Nasa Kennedy Space Centre |accessdate=22 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603211738/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/history/mercury/mercury-overview.htm |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; capsules were tested at Wallops in support of NASA's manned space flight program - the [[Mercury program]] - before astronauts were launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in Florida. Some of these tests using the [[Little Joe (rocket)|Little Joe]] [[booster rocket]] were designed to [[flight-qualify]] components of the spacecraft, including the escape and recovery systems and some of the life support systems. Two [[rhesus monkey]]s, Sam and Miss Sam, were sent aloft as pioneers for astronauts; both were recovered safely.

The first payload launched into orbit from Wallops Island was [[Explorer 9|Explorer IX]], atop a [[Scout rocket]], on February 15, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Myler, Joseph L. "7-Mile Salt Marsh, Sand Strip in Virginia Oldest, Tiniest Spaceport in U.S." (March 16, 1961), UPI via ''The Middlesboro Daily News", p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2013, the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer ([[LADEE]]) was launched from Wallops, atop a [[Minotaur V]] rocket. This was the first time that an American lunar mission had been launched from anywhere but [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.space.com/22673-nasa-ladee-moon-launch-webcast.html NASA Launch Shoots for the Moon from Virginia Tonight: Watch It Online]", Space.com, September 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallops Island is currently experiencing beach erosion of 10 to 22 feet (3 to 7 meters) a year, due in part to the [[current sea level rise]]; some access roads and parking lots have had to be rebuilt several times over the past five years. NASA has responded by continually fortifying the shoreline with sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/waters-edge-the-crisis-of-rising-sea-levels/ |title=As the seas rise, a slow-motion disaster gnaws at America’s shores |last1=McNeill |first1=Ryan |last2=Nelson |first2=Deborah J. |date=4 September 2014 |website=www.reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent ground control station for NASA's [[RQ-4 Global Hawk]] drone is at Wallops Flight Facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/local/virginia/2016/06/24/navy-triton-drones-wallops/86332348/ 3 governors, 1 mission: Bring drones to Wallops] Retrieved June 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==

[[Image:08-WFF Airspace.jpg|thumb|upright]]

The WFF Main Base is located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} west of [[Chincoteague, Virginia]]; about {{convert|90|mi|km}} north of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and {{convert|40|mi|km}} southeast of [[Salisbury, Maryland]]. The WFF consists of three separate parcels of land totaling 6,200 [[acres]] (25&amp;nbsp;km²): the Main Base, the Mainland, and the Wallops Island Launch Site. The Mainland and the Wallops Island Launch Site are about {{convert|7|mi|km}} southeast of the Main Base.

=== Airspace ===

Wallops operates [[controlled airspace]] with [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) qualified [[air traffic controller]]s including:

* The WFF Airport Control Zone to {{convert|2500|ft|m}} within a {{convert|5|smi|km|adj=on}} radius of the airport
* Restricted Area R-6604 connecting WFF airspace and offshore warning areas.

=== Fixed facilities ===

Major Wallops facilities include FAA-certified [[runway]]s; an experimental UAV runway; and crash, fire and rescue services. WFF has facilities for the receipt, inspection, assembly, checkout and storage of [[rocket motor]]s and other hazardous [[pyrotechnic device]]s. The Wallops Island Launch Site includes six [[launch pad]]s, three [[blockhouse]]s for launch control, and assembly buildings to support the preparation and launching of suborbital and orbital launch vehicles.

[[Image:03-WFF Launch Range Map.png|thumb|left|The NASA Wallops Flight Facility Range]]

The Wallops Research Range includes ground-based and mobile systems, and a range control center. Its radar facilities and systems are used for tracking and surveillance. Telemetry facilities include a variety of antennas, receivers, and display instrumentation systems. Command uplink and optical tracking facilities are included as part of the range. The range also provides premier digital photographic and video services including operation of numerous still cameras, high speed and video systems for Range Safety support, surveillance, and post-launch analysis (e.g., failure analysis), project documentation (e.g., fabrication and test), administrative documentation, and archiving for environmental studies. In addition, WFF has a variety of communications systems and facilities to route voice, video, and data in support of launch processing, flight and test operations.

The WFF Research Airport is located on the Main Base. There are three runways (from {{convert|4810|ft|m}} to {{convert|8750|ft|m}} long), two [[taxiway]]s, three ramps, and one hazardous cargo loading area in active service. Two ramps adjoin the two active hangars, and a third ramp adjoins the Crash, Fire and Rescue building. The primary research runway has a test section with a variety of surface textures and materials for runway research projects.

Weather measurements and predictions are critical to all Research Airport operations, rocket and balloon launches, and in safely conducting hazardous operations on the ground. Wallops meteorological services provide measurements of upper atmospheric and magnetic phenomena to augment and enable collection of scientific data by sensors aboard flight vehicles. The [[S-band]] [[Doppler radar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Philip A. Ingwersen and William Z.

It can detect a single raindrop of 3 millimeters at a range of 10 kilometers and cloud water content as little as 1&amp;nbsp;gram per cubic meter. SPANDAR’s sensitivity with its {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} dish antenna can detect small changes in the [[refractive index]] of air caused by sea breeze fronts, gust fronts, and various forms of [[clear air turbulence]].

=== Mobile systems ===

[[Image:16-WFF Launch Locations.jpg|thumb|right|The NASA Wallops Mobile Range instrumentation has been deployed to support launch events in dozens of locations around the world.]]

The Wallops mobile range instrumentation includes telemetry, radar, command and power systems. These assets are used as needed to supplement instrumentation at existing ranges, or to establish a temporary range to ensure safety and collect data to support the rocket customers in a remote location where no other range instrumentation exists. This complement of transportable systems can be deployed to provide complete range capabilities at remote locations around the world. While Wallops Island is the prime location for range services, major sounding rocket campaigns have been supported at [[Poker Flat]], [[Alaska]]; [[Andoya]], [[Norway]]; and [[Kwajalein]] Island, [[Marshall Islands]]. The Wallops Mobile Instrumentation is integrated with NASA and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] networks and can be used to supplement established ranges in support of rocket launches.

== Range technology development ==

[[Image:18-WFF Future Range.jpg|thumb|right|Envisioned Future Range Architecture]]

Since 2001, engineers at NASA Wallops Flight Facility have been developing new range technologies, systems and approaches to improve the cost and responsiveness of launch and flight test activities, within the constraints of available funding and program schedules.

Specifically, NASA Wallops has been leading two range technology development projects: the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070712035930/http://artwg.ksc.nasa.gov/Media/10_AFSS_%26_LCTT.pdf Autonomous Flight Safety System (AFSS) and the Low Cost TDRSS Transceiver (LCT2)].

AFSS is a project to develop an autonomous on-board system that could augment or replace traditional ground-commanded Range Safety flight termination systems. The AFSS would use redundant sensors and processors on board a launch vehicle to monitor its trajectory, and if necessary initiate pyrotechnic devices to terminate the flight.

LCT2 is an effort to produce a relatively low-cost transceiver to allow launch vehicles to communicate through NASA's [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] (TDRSS) after they have gone over the horizon from the launch site. LCT2 is being pursued as part of the Space Based Range Demonstration and Certification (SBRDC) program (formerly called [https://web.archive.org/web/20070712035931/http://www.spacecongress.org/2004/1a-denson.pdf Space Based Telemetry and Range Safety (STARS)]) in cooperation with NASA [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html Kennedy Space Center].

== Missions ==

== Commercial spaceport ==

In 1998, the [[Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority]], later joined by [[Maryland]], built the [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport]] at Wallops on land leased from NASA. In December 2006, the facility made its first launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2006-12-16-commercialrocket_x.htm?POE=TECISVA |title=Mid-Atlantic commercial spaceport makes 1st launch |date= December 16, 2006 |publisher=USATODAY |accessdate=22 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visitor center==
[[File:NASA Visitor Center at Wallops Flight Facility 002 crop.jpg|thumb|right|NASA Visitor Center at Wallops Flight Facility]]
The [[NASA Visitor Center (Wallops Flight Facility)|Wallops Visitor Center]] has a variety of hands-on exhibits and hosts weekly educational activities and programs to enable children to explore and learn about the technologies designed and used by NASA researchers and scientists. In addition, one Saturday each month, NASA invites [[model rocketry]] enthusiasts to launch their own rockets from the WFF rocket launch site. NASA personnel also participate, launching models of various rockets and explaining the [[spacecraft]] they carry in real life.

The schedule for sounding rocket launches from WFF is posted on its official Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wallops/home/ |title=NASA's Wallops Flight Facility |publisher=Nasa |accessdate=27 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
For many years WFF was home to the NSIP Sub-SEM and SEM projects. NSIP stands for the NASA Student Involvement Project, the Sub-SEM project was to design one of four experiments that would be inserted into an ORION-II one-stage rocket and launched above 98 percent of the atmosphere, and experience over 30 Gs of centrifugal force, while SEM was to design an experiment that would be flown on a future Space Shuttle mission. Each project gave 16 students and four teachers (four students and one teacher from each high school) the opportunity to spend an almost all-expense-paid week at WFF. Normally the students and teachers stayed in the Mariner Motel, now a Holiday Inn, conducting experiments and learning about the facility. Following the presidential mandate and budget cuts the entire NSIP program, SEM and Sub-SEM included, was shut down.

==Accidents==

On April 2, 1957, a [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-6 Neptune]] exploded in midair after takeoff from what was then known as [[NAAS Chincoteague]]. All eleven occupants of the aircraft died. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19570402-2|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 1995, the maiden flight of a [[Conestoga (rocket)|Conestoga 1620 rocket]] failed 46 seconds after liftoff, resulting in disintegration. [[Space Services Inc.|EER Space Systems]], Conestoga's manufacturer, concluded that low frequency noise from an unknown source upset the guidance system on the rocket causing it to order course corrections when none were needed. The rocket went off course when its first stage steering mechanism ran out of hydraulic fluid and became inoperable. After this failure, the Conestoga program was terminated, and EER abandoned the launch business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conestoga 1620|url=http://www.astronautix.com/c/conestoga1620.html|website=astronautix.com|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conestoga|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/conestoga.htm|website=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the launch, the Conestoga was the largest rocket ever launched from Wallops Island, and it was the first orbital mission attempted from the facility since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roylance|first1=Frank|title=Rocket explodes above Wallops Malfunction ends first commercial flight from NASA center|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-10-24/news/1995297106_1_rocket-eer-spacecraft|website=baltimoresun.com|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport Launch Pad 0|launch pad]] at Wallops Island were the first commercially built facilities in the US. 14 scientific experiments, some of which were planned to return from orbit, were destroyed. All debris landed in the Atlantic Ocean. There were no injuries. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chrasekaran|first1=Rajiv|title=Rocket explodes off VA.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1995/10/24/rocket-explodes-off-va/2f8b50ba-6b00-4682-ad42-b1a126ee3cad/?utm_term=.2c93a158fee2|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 1998 a [[Learjet 45]] was destroyed at Wallops after a loss of control during a water ingestion test flight. Only minor injuries to a copilot and flight engineer were reported. There were no ground injuries. The airplane was being used to test a new nose wheel tire.

On August 22, 2008, a [[ALV X-1]] [[sounding rocket]] was intentionally destroyed 20 seconds into flight after veering too far off course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tennant|first1=Diane|title=NASA destroys rocket shortly after launch at Wallops Island|url=https://pilotonline.com/business/article_5d649cf4-0f04-59e5-91be-e24d724f3a81.html|website=pilotonline.com|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On October 28, 2014, a failure occurred in an [[Antares (rocket)|Antares]] rocket, carrying [[Cygnus CRS Orb-3]], shortly after launch and destroyed both the rocket and the payload at the adjacent [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport]] on [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport Launch Pad 0|Launch Pad 0A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wall|first1=Mike|title=Private Orbital Sciences Rocket Explodes During Launch, NASA Cargo Lost|url=http://www.space.com/27576-private-orbital-sciences-rocket-explosion.html|website=space.com|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Western Thousand Buddha Caves''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|西|千|佛|洞}}|p=Xī Qiānfó Dòng}}) is a Buddhist cave temple site in [[Dunhuang]], [[Gansu Province]], China. The site is located approximately 35&amp;nbsp;km southwest of the urban centre and about the same distance from the [[Yangguan|Yangguan Pass]]; the area served as a staging post for travellers on the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref name="pamphlet"&gt;{{cite book |script-title=zh:敦煌西千佛洞石窟 |trans-title=Dunhuang Western Thousand Buddha Caves |language=Chinese, English, Japanese |editor=Zhang Xuerong |publisher=甘肃人民美术出版社 |year=1998 |isbn=9787805882314 |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the western counterpart of the [[Mogao Caves]], also known as the "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas" after the founding monk Yuezun's vision in 366 of "golden radiance in the form of a thousand Buddhas".&lt;ref name="Whitfield"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cave Temples of Mogao: Art and History on the Silk Road |author=Whitfield, Roderick (''et al.'') |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |year=2000 |isbn=0892365854 |pages=5, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caves were excavated from the cliff that runs along the north bank of the Dang River. A number have been lost to floods and collapse; some forty are still extant. Twenty-two decorated caves house 34 [[polychrome]] statues and 800 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of wall paintings, dating from the [[Northern Wei]] to the late-[[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] and early-[[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] Dynasties (sixth to fourteenth centuries).&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; The site was included within the 1961 designation of the [[Mogao Caves]] as a [[Major Site Protected for Its Historical and Cultural Value at the National Level|Major National Historical and Cultural Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sach.gov.cn/tabid/96/InfoID/16/frtid/134/Default.aspx |title=国务院关于公布第一批全国重点文物保护单位名单的通知 (1st Designations) |date=3 April 1961 |publisher=[[State Administration of Cultural Heritage]] |language=Chinese |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A manuscript from the [[Dunhuang manuscripts|Library Cave]], dating to the [[Five Dynasties]] and now at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]] in Paris, documents the early history of the site ([[Paul Pelliot|P]] 5034): according to the ''Domain Record of Shazhou Dudu Prefecture – Shouchang County'', "60 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' east of the county is a very old inscription that says '[[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Han Dynasty]]… made a small Buddha niche; the common people gradually built more'".&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/collections_fr.a4d |title=French Collections |publisher=[[International Dunhuang Project]] |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8307389s |title=Pelliot Manuscript 5034 |publisher=[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Shouchang County, modern Nanhu&lt;!--Not easy to disambiguate, it seems to be adandoned http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/photograph/dunhuang/0195.html.en --&gt; Village, is the location of the [[Yangguan|Yangguan Pass]] along the [[Hexi Corridor]], it is understood that this is a reference to the origins of the Western Thousand Buddha Caves.&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt;

The decorated caves are in three main sections: Caves 1–19 at the west end of the cliff, approximately one kilometre from the modern reservoir; Cave 20 in the middle of the site, near the second [[floodgate]]; and Caves 21 and 22 at the eastern end of the cliff.&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; Most of the sculptures were restored in a different style during the [[Qing Dynasty]] and the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; The caves at the western end of the site have had aluminium doors and glass partitions installed more recently with the intention of mitigating the [[Preventive conservation#Definition|environmental causes of deterioration]].&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; Some of the paintings at the far east end of the site, distant from the custodians' lodgings, have been [[Detachment of wall paintings|detached and remounted]] in a cave at [[Mogao Caves|Mogao]].&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; The ruined state of the main Buddha image in [[Northern Wei]] Cave 7 enables the construction techniques to be seen: layers of earthen [[Plaster|render]] over an [[Armature (sculpture)|armature]] of branches and reeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dha.ac.cn/0403/section.htm |script-title=zh:西千佛洞第7窟 |trans-title=Western Thousand Buddha Caves – Cave 7 |language=Chinese |publisher=[[Mogao Caves|Dunhuang Academy]] |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of upper paint layers also reveals the linear grid used to set out the design of the Thousand Buddhas on the cave walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qwdo8vWeQr8C&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Performing the Visual: The Practice of Buddhist Wall Painting in China and Central Asia |author=Fraser, Sarah Elizabeth |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=9780804745338 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;
