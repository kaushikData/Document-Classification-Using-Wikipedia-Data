      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11875">The '''2007 plot to behead a British Muslim soldier''' was a plot in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], to kidnap and [[Beheading in Islamism|behead]] a [[British people|British]] [[Muslim]] soldier in order to undermine the morale of the [[British Army]] and inhibit its recruitment of Muslims. The instigator, Parviz Khan, admitted the plot and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], to serve at least 14 years. Another of the accused was found guilty of failing to report the plot and four others were sentenced to up to seven years for supplying equipment to Pakistan-based militants fighting [[International Security Assistance Force|coalition forces]] in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=BBCLife/&gt;

==The plot==
Shortly after the arrests, reports appeared in a number of newspapers with details of the plot, citing unnamed security sources. According to the newspaper reports, the plot involved kidnapping a British Muslim soldier and taking him either to a run-down house in Leatherhead Close, [[Aston]], Birmingham,&lt;ref name=murdervideos&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Parker|title=Murder videos at raid house|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2007050501,00.html|work=The Sun|date=2007-02-02|accessdate=2007-02-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204030918/http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2007050501,00.html|archive-date=2007-02-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed to be owned by the wife of suspect Zahoor Iqbal&lt;ref name=thesuspectknown&gt;{{cite news|first=Andy|last=Dolan|first2=Sam|last2=Greenhill|title=The suspect known as the Terminator|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=433003&amp;in_page_id=1770|work=The Daily Mail|date=2007-02-03|accessdate=2007-02-12|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120215/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=433003&amp;in_page_id=1770|archive-date=2007-09-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[safe house]] in [[Tipton]], nine miles from [[Birmingham]]. There, he would be blindfolded, handcuffed, made to demand the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, and then he would be killed. A video of this would be released on the Internet.&lt;ref name=wellbehead&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom Newton|last=Dunn|title=We'll behead him in Tipton...|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2007050324,00.html|work=The Sun|date=2007-02-01|accessdate=2007-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203045815/http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C2-2007050324%2C00.html|archive-date=2007-02-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a password-protected Internet forum affiliated with [[Al-Qaeda]], the plotters were told:{{by whom?|date=March 2017}} "It is preferable if you photograph or video the operation so that it can have a bigger set of viewers and can be used by the media."&lt;ref name=howalqaeda&gt;{{cite news|first=Russell|last=Jenkins|first2=Daniel|last2=McGrory|title=How al-Qaeda 'tried to bring Baghdad to Birmingham'|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article1308572.ece|work=The Times|date=2007-02-01|accessdate=2007-07-06|location=London, UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224025422/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article1308572.ece|archive-date=2007-02-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some newspaper reports also said that the group spent months compiling a hit list of 25 potential targets.&lt;ref name=alqaedawas /&gt;&lt;ref name=muslimsoldiersfaced&gt;{{cite news|author2=Daniel McGrory, Stewart Tendler and Dominic Kennedy|title=Muslim soldiers 'faced kidnap and beheading'|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article1308572.ece|work=The Times|date=2007-02-01|accessdate=2007-02-08|location=London, UK|first1=Russell|last1=Jenkins|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211023541/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article1308572.ece|archive-date=2007-02-11|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four people were separately accused of supplying equipment on four occasions to Pakistan-based militants fighting the [[International Security Assistance Force]] in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=BBCLife/&gt; They had used the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] as a cover to ship [[angling|anglers']] gloves used by [[snipers]], sleeping bags, boots, waterproof map holders, [[laser rangefinder]]s, anti-[[bugging]] equipment, video cameras and mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7241778.stm|work=BBC News|title=The jihadi and the beheading plot|date=2008-02-18|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|access-date=2008-02-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222205434/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7241778.stm|archive-date=2008-02-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arrests==
For six months, British police forces and intelligence agencies, under the codename Operation Gamble, had been investigating the plot.&lt;ref name=howalqaeda/&gt; They had hoped to investigate for another two months before making arrests, but when one of the suspects purchased a video camera it was feared that this was done in preparation for the kidnapping, so the police brought forward their decision to make the arrests.&lt;ref name=wellbehead/&gt;&lt;ref name=alqaedawas&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Wright|first2=Ben|last2=Taylor|title=Al Qaeda was behind 'plot' to behead soldier|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=432962&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ct=5|publisher=The Daily Mail|date=2007-02-01|accessdate=2007-02-08|location=London, UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929144356/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=432962&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ct=5|archive-date=2007-09-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2007, just before 4:00 am, more than 700 police officers raided eight homes and four businesses, including a corner store, two Islamic bookstores and an internet cafe. Eight men were arrested then,&lt;ref name=alqaedawas/&gt; with a ninth arrested later in the afternoon while driving into Birmingham.&lt;ref name=muslimsoldiersfaced/&gt;

===Leaks===
The sentencing judge described the leaking of information to the media at the time of the arrests as being a "very grave contempt of court". An inquiry by the [[Metropolitan Police]] failed to discover the source of these leaks. The civil liberties organisation [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] said these leaks risked "undermining the work of police and prosecutors and jeopardising the trust and safety of the public".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Government terror conduct queried|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6335453.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-02-06|accessdate=2007-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218170110/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6335453.stm|archive-date=2007-02-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
In February 2008, five men were sentenced after admitting or being found guilty of these allegations.&lt;ref name=Admits&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7215081.stm|work=BBC News|title=Man admits plot to behead soldier|date=2008-01-29|access-date=2008-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201134831/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7215081.stm|archive-date=2008-02-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''3D floor plan''', or 3D floorplan, is a virtual model of a [[building]] [[floor plan]], depicted from a [[birds eye view]], utilized within the building industry to better convey architectural plans. Usually built to scale, a 3D floor plan must include walls and a floor and typically includes exterior wall [[Building|fenestrations]], windows, and doorways. It does not include a ceiling so as not to obstruct the view. Other common attributes may be added, but are not required, such as cabinets, flooring, bathroom fixtures, paint color, wall tile, and other interior finishes. Furniture may be added to assist in communicating proper [[home staging]] and interior design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/784720/a-virtual-look-into-don-drapers-mad-men-apartment|title=A Virtual Look Into Don Draperâs Mad Men Apartment|date=2016-03-31|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

3D floor plans assist real estate marketers and [[architects]] in explaining floor plans to clients. Their simplicity allows individuals unfamiliar with conventional floor plans to understand difficult architectural concepts. This allows architects and homeowners to literally see design elements prior to [[construction]] and alter design elements during the design phase. 3D floorplans are often commissioned by architects, builders, hotels, universities, real estate agents, and property owners to assist in relating their floor plans to clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/09/09/virtual-reality-real-estate/|title=Now you can shop for luxury homes in virtual reality|date=2015-09-09|website=Fortune|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==

A 3D floor plan is built utilizing advanced 3D rendering software, the same type of software used to create major animated motion pictures. Through complex lighting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://about.archilogic.com/blog/3d-models-light-baking/|title=How to enhance the atmosphere of 3d models with light baking? - Archilogic|date=2016-06-20|website=Archilogic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; staging, camera, and [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] techniques 3D floor plans appear to be real photographs rather than digital representations of the buildings after which they are modeled. It is also the presentation of building floor-plan in an advanced manner, bringing it to real life views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2016/06/06/digital-model-virtual-reality-preview-big-bjarke-ingels-group-serpentine-gallery-pavilion-archilogic/|title=Virtual-reality preview of BIG's Serpentine Gallery Pavilion|date=2016-06-06|website=Dezeen|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

WebGL allows many companies to provide their users with unique 3D experiences right in their web browser. In addition, since 2014, WebVR helps make Virtual Reality experiences accessible to wider audiences. 3D floor plans can now be visited via Google Cardboard or various VR headsets. Due to the increasing popularity of VR content, many real estate professionals (real estate firms, developers, online platforms) are turning to 3D models of spaces to improve their marketing efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.property-report.com/how-technology-is-changing-almost-every-aspect-of-real-estate/|title=How technology is changing almost every aspect of real estate|date=2016-07-11|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ACE Electoral Knowledge Network''' is a web portal with information on elections designed to meet the needs of people working in the electoral field.

== Goals ==
The goal of the ACE network is to provide knowledge to people working in the field elections, with the intention of supporting credible and transparent electoral processes with emphasis on sustainability, professionalism and trust.

== The ACE Website ==
Most activities of the ACE network are carried out through the ACE website. The website is divided into a number of sections:
* Elections today contains information on current affairs in elections, such as news articles, upcoming events and an election calendar.
* Encyclopaedia presents texts and articles on a number of electoral topics (for example Electoral Systems or Elections and Technology).
* Comparative Data provides statistics (graphs, pie charts etc.) and data on election-related topics.
* Electoral Materials is a virtual library with sample materials (ballot papers, electoral laws, publications etc.) from different countries.
* Support and Advice holds information on areas of electoral support (election observation and assistance) and links to the ACE expert network.
* Regions and Countries is a portal page for region- or country-specific information.
* About ACE has more information about the ACE network and its structure.

The full website is fully available in English while much content is also available in Spanish, French, Arabic and Russian.

== The ACE Experts ==
Part of ACE is the Practitioners' Network&lt;ref&gt;http://aceproject.org/about-en/practitioners2019-network&lt;/ref&gt; â an online community of experts in the field of elections. The members of the Practitionersâ Network share a private online platform where they discuss electoral issues, exchange experiences and connect to fellow experts. Any user can submit a question to the Practitionersâ Network; the question will be discussed among the experts and the expert replies forwarded to the user.

The Practitionersâ Network is open to applications; membership of the network is free but members are required to have âseveral years of experience of working in a senior position for one or a number of organisations within the electoral fieldâ and/or âproven expertiseâ in a specific area of elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/about-en/practitioners2019-network/default#who-can-join-the |title=About the Practitionersâ Network â ACE Electoral Knowledge Network |publisher=Aceproject.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ACE network was created in 1998 as the ACE ('''Administration and Cost of Elections''') Project by [[International IDEA]], [[International Foundation for Electoral Systems|IFES]] and [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|UNDESA]]. At this time, the project focused solely on election administration with the aim to create an encyclopaedia with texts on how to administer electoral processes. However, the project developed further into a more interactive network with a focus wider than just electoral administration. In 2006, to reflect the new identity of the project, the name was changed to the ACE Electoral Knowledge Network (with the letters ACE no longer standing for Administration and Cost of Elections).

== Organisation ==
ACE is a collaboration between nine Partner Organisations: [[International IDEA|International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA)]], [[Electoral Institute of Southern Africa|Electoral Institute for the Sustainability of Democracy in Africa (EISA)]], [[Elections Canada]], the [[Federal Electoral Institute|Federal Electoral Institute of Mexico (IFE)]], [[International Foundation for Electoral Systems|International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES)]] and the UN agencies [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|UNDESA]], [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] and UNEAD. The [[European Commission]] is an ''ex officio'' member.

The highest decision-making body of ACE is the Steering Board, consisting of representatives from the Partner Organisations. The day-to-day management of the project is carried out by the ACE Secretariat, currently hosted by International IDEA. The Secretariat is assisted in its tasks by the Programme Advisory Board with representatives from the ACE Partner Organisations.

The '''Alliance for Germany''' ({{lang-de|Allianz fÃ¼r Deutschland}}) was an opposition coalition in [[East Germany]]. It was formed on 5 February 1990 in [[Berlin]] (then [[West Berlin]]) to stand in the East-German [[Volkskammer]] elections. It consisted of the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], [[Democratic Awakening]] and the [[German Social Union (East Germany)|German Social Union]]. The [[German Forum Party]] was invited to join, but refused.

The Alliance won the most votes in the election, winning 48.2% of votes cast (CDU 40.9%; DSU 6.3%; DA 0.9%), and would control 192 of 400 seats in the Volkskammer. It formed the interim-government in East Germany until [[German Reunification]]. [[Lothar de MaiziÃ¨re]] from the CDU was  minister-president.

The '''American Peace Society''' is a [[pacifist]] group founded upon the initiative of [[William Ladd]], in [[New York City]], May 8, 1828. It was formed by the merging of many state and local societies, from New York, Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, of which the oldest, the [[New York Peace Society]], dated from 1815. Ladd was an advocate of a "Congress and High Court of Nations." The society organized peace conferences and regularly published a periodical entitled [[Advocate of Peace]].
The Society was only opposed to wars between [[nation states]]; it did not oppose the [[American Civil War]],
regarding the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union's]] war as a "police action" against the "criminals" of
the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]],

{{ISBN|0865547262}} (p.158).&lt;/ref&gt;  Its most famous leader was [[Benjamin Franklin Trueblood]] (1847â1916), a [[Quaker]] who in his book ''The Federation of the World'' (1899) called for the establishment of an international state to bring about lasting peace in the world. In 1834 the headquarters of the society were removed to [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], in 1834 to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in 1911 to Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[[New International Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The group is now based in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].

'''Automated valuation model''' (AVM) is the name given to a service that can provide real estate property valuations using [[mathematical model]]ling combined with a database. Most AVMs calculate a propertyâs value at a specific point in time by analyzing values of comparable properties. Some also take into account previous surveyor valuations, historical [[Real estate pricing|house price]] movements and user inputs (e.g. number of bedrooms, [[home improvement|property improvements]], etc.).

Appraisers, [[Wall Street|investment professionals and lending institutions]] use AVM technology in their analysis of residential property. An AVM is a residential valuation report that can be obtained in a matter of seconds. It is a technology-driven report. The product of an automated valuation technology comes from analysis of public record data and computer decision logic combined to provide a calculated estimate of a probable selling price of a residential property. An AVM generally uses a combination of two types of evaluation, a [[Hedonic regression|hedonic model]] and a repeat sales index. The results of each are weighted, analyzed and then reported as a final estimate of value based on a requested date.

An AVM typically includes:
* An indicative market value for many residential properties nationwide.
* The tax assessor's indication of value, if available.
* Information on a subject property and recent sales history.
* Comparable sales analysis of like properties.

In the late 1990s, this technology was used primarily by [[institutional investor]]s to determine risk when purchasing collateralized mortgage loans.

== Advantages ==
AVMs are increasingly used by mortgage lenders to determine what a [[property]] might be worth in order for them to lend against the valuation.
The advantages of using AVMs over traditional appraisals are that they save time, money and resources (e.g. there are no transport requirements), thus lowering the cost of valuing a property. Many AVMs can be made and used with little cost, so more choices in valuation methodology are also possible.
It is claimed that unlike traditional appraisals, AVM outputs do not suffer from the same fraud risk although certain providers can have their systems manipulated intentionally or otherwise if property features are incorrectly entered.
AVMs remove the human element from the valuation process and rely on computer automation so as to remove human bias and subjectivity. &lt;ref&gt;Downie, M. L. &amp; Robson G. (2007) Automated Valuation Models: an international perspective. p. 32 [[Council of Mortgage Lenders]], London, {{ISBN|1-905257-12-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Mitropoulos, A., Wu, W. &amp; Kohansky G. (2007)Criteria for Automated Valuation Models in the UK. Fitch Ratings. p. 1 [[Council of Mortgage Lenders]], London, {{ISBN|1-905257-12-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

AVMs are particularly useful in assessing the value of a property portfolio. Using an automated model can also be useful for valuing an individual property where the provider can deliver a suitable level of accuracy.

== Disadvantages ==
The disadvantages are that they do not take into account the property condition, as a physical inspection of the property does not occur and therefore the valuation produced assumes an average condition which may not reflect reality. Purchasers relying on an AVM-backed mortgage application will need to get separate advice to establish the true condition of the property.
New build property is particularly difficult to value due to the lack of comparable properties and historic data; however, an advantage of AVMs is that they pull on a larger pool of comparables and as such are not prone to incorporating the claimed 'new-build premium', although it would rely on comparables from physical inspections to achieve this. Other data sources used are sometimes misleading due to concealed incentives in recorded sales prices (e.g. [[Land registration|Land Registry]]). AVMs also do not work particularly well on large [[Tower block|blocks of flats]] where aspect can have a significant effect on value.

Initial concern over the effectiveness of AVMs in falling markets have now been answered as the best performing models have remained highly effective throughout the latest downturns although their use for "retrospective valuations" has contributed to wasteful activity in some areas â this is not a fault of the tools but a lack of appreciation by some of those using them.

Many AVMs are also using transactional data, which may lag anywhere from three to six months.  This is a good starting point but still does not account for changes in current market conditions.

The '''Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections''' ({{lang-ms|Gabungan Pilihanraya Bersih dan Adil}}) or '''Bersih''' (meaning ''clean'' in Malay) is a coalition of [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs) which seeks to reform the current electoral system in [[Malaysia]] to ensure free, clean and fair elections.

The idea of Bersih was initiated by five opposition parties in 2005 which later included other NGOs in this as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khoo|first=Y.

It was officially formed on 23 November 2006 as a joint [[communiquÃ©]] that comprised leaders from political parties, civil society groups and NGOs.&lt;ref name="formation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bersih.org/?page_id=4109 |title=About Bersih 2.0 |publisher=bersih.org |date=26 June 2011 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226085212/http://bersih.org/?page_id=4109 |archivedate=26 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bersih accused the [[Election Commission of Malaysia|Election Commission]] under Prime Minister's Department &lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.my/?menu=page&amp;page=1670 |title=Election Commission of Malaysia |publisher=Prime Minister's Office |date=30 April 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for manipulating the electoral process to give an unfair advantage to the ruling [[National Front (Malaysia)|National Front]] coalition. Bersih claimed that the electoral roll was marred by irregularities such as [[gerrymandering]], [[phantom voter]]s, [[malapportionment]] and [[postal voting|postal vote]] frauds. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} On 10 November 2007, Bersih organised the [[2007 Bersih rally|first rally]] with 10,000 to 40,000 turnout and held a public demonstration at [[Dataran Merdeka]], [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Supporters of Bersih were urged to wear yellow T-shirts as a symbol of protest. The rally was often credited for the shift in political landscape in [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]], when the incumbent National Front coalition failed to obtain a two-thirds supermajority for the first time since 1969.

In April 2010, the coalition was relaunched as an entirely civil society movement ("Bersih 2.0") unaffiliated to any political party. On 19 June 2011, former president of the [[Malaysian Bar|Bar Council]], [[Malay styles and titles#Datuk.27|Dato']] [[Ambiga Sreenevasan]] became the chairperson of the coalition. In 2011 and 2012, two more rallies ([[Bersih 2.0 rally|Bersih 2.0]] and [[Bersih 3.0 rally|Bersih 3.0]]) were organised seeing that the demands for the electoral reforms have not been met by the Electoral Commission.

==History==
Bersih started out as a Joint Action Committee for Electoral Reform which was formed in July 2005. In the following year September 2006, an Electoral Reform Workshop was held in Kuala Lumpur whereby the various leaders from political parties, civil society groups and NGOs, including [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail]], [[Lim Guan Eng]], [[Parti Islam Se-Malaysia|PAS]], [[Nasharudin Mat Isa]], [[Teresa Kok]], Syed Shahir Syed Mohamud among others, came together to formulate a joint communiquÃ©. The main objective of this meeting is to advocate for a clean and fair election in Malaysia.

===2007 Bersih rally===
[[File:BersihRallyHafiz.jpg|thumb|right|Rallying crowd in front of the [[Istana Negara, Jalan Istana|Istana Negara]].]]
{{main|2007 Bersih rally}}
On Saturday 10 November 2007, Bersih held the first mass rally to make four demands to ensure a clean and fair electoral process in Malaysia:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bersih.org/?p=335 |title=Bersih people's gathering |publisher=bersih.org |date=22 October 2007 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Clean up of the electoral roll
# Use of indelible ink
# Abolition of postal voting for military and police personnel
# Free and fair access to mass media for all parties

The rally took place in the area of Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya around [[Dataran Merdeka]] (Independence Square) and [[Istana Negara, Jalan Istana|Istana Negara]] (The National Palace). Bersih estimated the turnout to be at least 30,000, while the official claimed there were 10,000 protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2007/11/2008525132141449985.html |title=Tear gas fired at Malaysia rally |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=10 November 2007 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow shirts and ribbons were used as the symbol of protest as yellow is also the colour for citizen actions worldwide and for press freedom movement. A memorandum containing the four demands was submitted to the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], Malaysia's head of state, during the rally.

Malaysian police refused to issue a permit for the rally, rendering the rally illegal. Tear gas and chemical-laced water cannon were used by the riot police to disperse the crowd. 245 people were detained following the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2007/11/2008525131044386491.html |title=Hundreds held over Malaysia protest |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=12 November 2007 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the initial rally, Bersih indicated it may hold another street demonstration if government extended the tenure of Election Commission (EC) chairperson Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman.  On 20 November 2007, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Nazri Aziz tabled a first reading of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2007 that sought to extend the retirement age of members of Election Commission (EC) from 65 to 66. Parliament passed legislation on 11 December to increase EC members' retirement age from 65 to 66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/4742?tid=4|title=Malaysia: Bersih May Stage Another Protest|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 Bersih 2.0 rally===
{{main|Bersih 2.0 rally}}
[[File:Bersih 2 protest.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters marching the streets of [[Kuala Lumpur]] peacefully before the police confronted them.]]
The 2007 rally had raised Malaysian citizens' awareness to the irregularities and controversies in the electoral system. Ahead of the anticipated 2012 13th general election, Bersih scheduled a second public demonstration at Kuala Lumpur on 9 July 2011. Bersih 2.0 rally, also called ''the Walk for Democracy'', called for eight points, including the four demands that remained not met in the 2008 general election:
# Clean up of the electoral roll
# Reform of postal ballot
# Use of indelible ink
# Minimum 21 days of campaign period
# Free and fair access to mass media for all parties
# Strengthening of public institutions
# No corruption
# No dirty politics

Bersih 2.0 was endorsed by 62 NGOs and joined by rallies in more than 30 international cities by oversea Malaysians in solidarity. The rally was again denied a permit. Plans for the demonstration were extensively criticised by the government and pro-government media. Police set up multiple road blocks around Kuala Lumpur and arrested 225 Bersih supporters in the lead-up to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands of Malaysians Rally for Changes to Elections |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/world/asia/10malaysia.html |last=Gooch |first=Liz |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 July 2011 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being granted an audience with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to discuss the issue, Bersih subsequently agreed on 5 July 2011 to move the rally from the streets to [[Stadium Merdeka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersihâs Ambiga: No street march, rally will be held in stadium |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/7/5/nation/20110705160353&amp;sec=nation |newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=5 July 2011 |last=Lee |first=Yen Mun |accessdate=5 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708051317/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F7%2F5%2Fnation%2F20110705160353&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia Street Protests Averted as Group Agrees to Use Stadium |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-05/malaysia-street-protests-averted-as-group-agrees-to-use-stadium.html |newspaper=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=5 July 2011 |last1=Gan |first1=Yen Kuan |last2=Ten Kate |first2=Daniel |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the turnout on 9 July 2011 ranged from 10,000 to 50,000. The police deployed tear gas and water cannons to break up the protest and arrested more than 1600 protesters, including Ambiga and several event organisers and opposition figures.

===2012 Bersih 3.0 rally===
{{main|Bersih 3.0 rally}}
[[File:Bersih rally in Ipoh.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from the Bersih 3.0 rally in Polo Ground, [[Ipoh]].]]
Following the Bersih 2.0 demonstration, the Malaysian government set up Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) on 2 October 2011 to respond to the electoral issues. In early April 2012, PSC released a report with 22 recommendations to improve the electoral system. The report was received and passed by the [[Dewan Rakyat]] (House of Representatives) on 3 April 2012 according to the voice of the majority without debate. An opposition minority report was proposed to be included but was rejected by the Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nst.com.my/latest/psc-report-on-electoral-reforms-passed-in-parliament-1.70331 |title=PSC report on electoral reforms passed in Parliament |last=Mokhtar |first=Ili Liyana |newspaper=[[New Straits Times]] |location=Kuala Lumpur |date=3 April 2012 |accessdate=29 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428184923/http://www.nst.com.my/latest/psc-report-on-electoral-reforms-passed-in-parliament-1.70331 |archivedate=28 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bersih was unsatisfied with the PSC reports as (i) the existing Election Commission was tasked to carry out the recommendations; (ii) many of the recommendations asked for a lengthy implementation period; (iii) many allegations of electoral frauds were not acknowledged in the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://bersih.org/?p=4627 |title=Response from Bersih 2.0 to the recommendations of the Parliamentary Select Committee on electoral reform |publisher=bersih.org |date= 3 April 2012|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the issues, the third public demonstration, namely the Bersih 3.0 rally, was announced and took place on 28 April 2012 at Dataran Merdeka. The Bersih 3.0 rally was a sit-down protest (''Duduk Bantah'' in Malay). In addition to the eight previous demands, it called for:
# Resignation of the existing Electoral Commission
# Implementation of the 8 demands before the 13th general election
# Observation of the 13th general election by international observers

Bersih 3.0 was endorsed by 84 NGOs. In particular, it was joined by [[Himpunan Hijau]] (Green Assembly), a civil movement protesting the [[Lynas]] rare earth project in Malaysia. In addition to the main rally at Kuala Lumpur, smaller rallies were held in 10 other cities in Malaysia, as well as in 34 other countries.

Police again deployed tear gas and water cannon against the protestors, despite it being a peaceful demonstration. The chaos started when police began to scatter the crowd. Tear gas and water cannon targeted the exit points and the middle of the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;âº 2:50âº 2:50www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek5mQkugUxQ&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bersih People's Tribunal ===
[[File:Bersih_4_29082015.JPG|thumb|right|Crowd listening to Maria's speech in Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur]]
A tribunal was organised by Bersih on 18â21 September 2013 in regards to the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|general elections]] that was held on 5 May 2013, whereby invited witnesses gave testimonies on the irregularities and incidents of fraud.

There were also calls for Election Commission to resign due to the way electoral demarcations were formed in past redelineation exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/ec-must-quit-before-new-boundaries-drawn-bersih-says|title=EC must quit before new boundaries drawn, Bersih says|date=4 March 2014|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2014/03/25/bersih-set-up-boundaries-commission/|title=Bersih Tribunal: Set up Boundaries Commission|date=25 March 2014|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Bersih 4 rally===

Bersih 4 rallies are scheduled to be held on the streets of Kuala Lumpur, Kuching, and Kota Kinabalu from 29â30 August, 2pm until midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bersih 2.0 {{!}} Gabungan Pilihanraya Bersih dan Adil â BERSIH 4: The Time Has Come|url = http://www.bersih.org/bersih-4-the-time-has-come/|website = www.bersih.org|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gathering places for the rally should be located at Brickfields, Pasar Seni, Dataran Maybank, National Mosque, and Sogo shopping mall, according to the Bersih 2.0 chairperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bersih 4.0 organisers list five demands, propose institutional reforms|url = http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1525407|website=thesundaily.my|accessdate = 2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first Bersih rally that are racially imbalance, with Chinese predominantly at the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racial imbalance, predominantly Chinese at rally|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/310400|accessdate=23 September 2015|agency=malaysiakini.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2141">The '''ClarkeâMcNary Act of 1924''' (ch. 348, {{USStat|43|653}}, enacted June 7, 1924) was one of several pieces of [[United States federal legislation]] and was named for [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[John D. Clarke]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Charles McNary]]. 

The 1911 [[Weeks Act]] had allowed the purchase of land to enlarge the [[United States National Forest|National Forest System]]. Two years after the Weeks Act was passed, over 700,000 acres (2,800&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) had been purchased for the National Forest system in the [[Eastern United States]]. More than 2 million acres (8,000&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of land had been purchased by 1920.

The ClarkeâMcNary Act made it much easier for the Forest Service to buy land from willing sellers within predetermined national forest boundaries. It enabled the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] to work cooperatively with State officials for better forest protection, chiefly in [[fire control]] and [[water resources]]. It also provided for continuous production of [[timber]]. Additionally, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) began working with private forestland owners in reforestation. That was done by broadening the cooperative efforts to include producing and distributing tree seedlings and providing forestry assistance to farmers.

The laws also gave a strong impetus to states to establish and to support state forestry agencies. All 50 states now have a state forestry agency or forestry [[extension agency]].

'''Clayton Lee Waagner''' (born August 25, 1956) is a convicted [[bank robber]] and [[anti-abortion]] [[terrorist]]. He was born '''Roger Waagner''' in [[North Dakota]]. He was an escaped [[fugitive]] during the spring, summer and fall of 2001 and was the [[FBI]]'s [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 2000s|467th fugitive to be placed on the Ten Most Wanted]] list for carjackings, firearms violations, and bank robbery on September 21, 2001. He was placed on the [[United States Marshals Service]] Top 15 Fugitives list for sending more than 280 letters that claimed to contain [[anthrax]], which he mailed to [[Planned Parenthood]] with return addresses of the Marshals Service and the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] beginning in October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/the-fbi-announces-new-information-regarding-top-ten-fugitive-clayton-lee-waagner# |title=FBI â The FBI Announces New Information Regarding Top Ten Fugitive Clayton Lee Waagner |access-date=2016-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529104222/https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/the-fbi-announces-new-information-regarding-top-ten-fugitive-clayton-lee-waagner/# |archive-date=2016-05-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently in prison.

==Prior crimes==
Waagner had previously been sentenced to 4â10 years for attempted robbery in 1992. Years later as a convicted felon released from prison, early in September 1999, he was pulled over by the [[Pennsylvania State Police]], but fled into the woods and evaded capture, leaving behind a stolen car that contained firearms, explosives, [[identity document forgery|false identity papers]], and a list of [[abortion clinic]]s.

Later in September 1999, while on a self-described "Mission from [[God]]", he took his wife and their nine children on a cross-country road trip headed west in a stolen [[recreational vehicle|Winnebago]], planning to [[murder]] various abortion doctors, beginning with one in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].  However, after crossing into [[Illinois]] his vehicle broke down, and Waagner was arrested when [[Illinois State Police]] stopped to investigate. Waagner was convicted on charges of interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle and for being a convicted [[Felony|felon]] in possession of [[firearm]]s.

While he was awaiting sentencing and facing a term of 15 years to life, Waagner escaped from [[DeWitt County, Illinois|DeWitt County]] Jail in [[Clinton, Illinois]], on February 22, 2001.

==Escaped fugitive crime trail==
As an escaped fugitive felon from Clinton Illinois, Waagner made his way back east to Pennsylvania, where three months later he became wanted for the bank robbery of a [[First Union]] in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] in May 2001.

His fugitive trail then led southwest, where he was next identified as having abandoned a vehicle in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], following a hit and run accident. Authorities recovered law enforcement-type equipment, anti-abortion literature, and weapons from the car. He next became wanted for [[carjacking]]s across the state line in [[Tunica, Mississippi|Tunica]], and [[Robinsonville, Mississippi]], and firearms violations in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], on September 7, 2001. Later that month, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]] placed him on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]], in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/clayton-lee-waagner-named-to-fbis-ten-most-wanted-fugitives-list# |title=FBI â Clayton Lee Waagner Named to FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List |access-date=2016-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317065704/https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/clayton-lee-waagner-named-to-fbis-ten-most-wanted-fugitives-list/# |archive-date=2016-03-17 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthrax hoax==
{{see also|Anthrax hoaxes}}
Waagner then became most infamous for a [[hoax]] in November 2001, in which he sent envelopes containing a white powder to more than 500 [[abortion]] providers.  The envelopes also contained a note, which said, "You have been exposed to [[anthrax]].  We are going to kill all of you.  From the [[Army of God (USA)|Army of God]], Virginia Dare Chapter."  The threat was considered serious, as it arrived shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks on America, as well as the then-recent [[2001 anthrax attacks|delivery of genuine anthrax letters]] to various governmental officials.
A [[United States Marshals Service]] Top 15 Fugitive since March 6, 2001,  Waagner also became a [[FBI Ten Most Wanted]] fugitive because of the more than 280 letters that threatened to contain anthrax, which he mailed to [[Planned Parenthood]], with return addresses of the [[U.S. Marshals Service]] and the [[U.S. Secret Service]] beginning in October 2001. In the wave of mailed letters, Waagner was accused of stalkings and threats to kill 42 low-level [[abortion clinic]] employees up through November 23, 2001.

On November 29, 2001, the FBI took the unusual step of releasing a press release of new information about Waagner seeking the public's assistance, while also pointing out that Waagner's letters were not associated with the recent letters that had been sent to the offices of Senators [[Tom Daschle]] and [[Patrick Leahy]] which actually did contain [[anthrax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/letter-addressed-to-senator-patrick-j.-leahy-appears-to-contain-anthrax# |title=FBI â Letter Addressed To Senator Patrick J. Leahy Appears To Contain Anthrax |access-date=2016-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630132035/https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/letter-addressed-to-senator-patrick-j.-leahy-appears-to-contain-anthrax/# |archive-date=2016-06-30 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The white powder in Waagner's letters initially tested positive for anthrax, due to the addition of a powdered [[insecticide]] known to trigger [[false positive]] results.

==Capture and conviction==
He was captured on December 5, 2001, after a clerk at a [[Kinko's]] copy shop in [[Springdale, Ohio]], identified him from a photograph on a [[wanted poster]] circulated by members of the [[United States Marshals Service]].  Waagner had been known to patronize Kinko's stores in the past, and for this reason the Marshals sent a copy to every store in the chain.  When arrested, he was preparing to [[fax]] a [[bomb threat]] to a mass list of clinics.  In addition to his earlier 15 years to life sentence in Illinois, he was convicted April 18, 2002, in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]'s U.S District Court on separate firearms and car theft charges.  For the anthrax letter spree, he received a 53-count indictment, and on December 3, 2003, he was convicted on 51 of the 53 counts, including charges of violating the [[Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act]], threatening the use of weapons of mass destruction, and mailing threatening communications. He was sentenced to 19 years in a federal prison.

==Prison==
Waagner has distributed a [[manifesto]] while in prison, and continues to correspond with outside individuals, including other members of the [[Army of God (USA)|Army of God]]. He is currently serving in [[List of U.S. federal prisons|United States Penitentiary]], [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]], with a projected release date of January 27, 2046.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;LastName=Waagner&amp;Middle=&amp;FirstName=Clayton&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=&amp;x=17&amp;y=14# |title=Federal Bureau of Prisons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104730/http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;LastName=Waagner&amp;Middle=&amp;FirstName=Clayton&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=&amp;x=17&amp;y=14# |archive-date=2007-09-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Donald Spitz]] was suspected of harboring Clayton Waagner and receiving phone calls from him while Waagner was on the lam.&lt;ref&gt;Soldier of God â Hampton Roads Magazine â NovemberâDecember 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Controller and Auditor-General''' (the Auditor-General) is an Officer of the [[New Zealand Parliament]] responsible for [[audit]]ing public bodies. John Ryan began his seven-year term as Controller and Auditor-General on 2 July 2018. The Deputy Controller and Auditor-General is [[Greg Schollum]]. Their mandate and responsibilities are set out in the [[Public Audit Act 2001]]. They are appointed by the [[Governor-General]] on the recommendation of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

==Role and functions==
Public entities are accountable to Parliament and the public for their use of public resources and powers conferred by Parliament. The Auditor-General provides independent assurance that public entities are operating, and accounting for their performance, in keeping with Parliament's intentions. The Auditor-General is independent of executive government and Parliament in discharging the functions of the statutory office, but is answerable to Parliament for stewardship of the public resources entrusted to her.

Under the [[Public Audit Act 2001]], the Auditor-General is the auditor of all public entities, including:
* the Crown
* government departments
* [[Crown entities]] (such as the Commerce Commission, the New Zealand Transport Agency, and Te Papa)
* [[State-owned enterprises]] (such as New Zealand Post, Kiwibank, and the Meteorological Service of New Zealand)
* local authorities and their subsidiaries (for example, local councils, ports, and airports)
* [[district health boards]]
* tertiary education institutions (universities, polytechs, and wÄnanga)
* schools
* statutory boards
* other public bodies

The Auditor-General employs the public sector organisation Audit New Zealand and contracts with private sector accounting firms to carry out these annual audits.

As well as annual audits, the Auditor-General carries out performance audits and inquiries. Other work of the Auditor-General includes: 
* advice to Parliament
* advice and liaison
* working with the accounting and auditing profession
* international liaison and involvement.

==The organisation's structure==
The Auditor-General employs staff in two business units â the Office of the Auditor-General and Audit New Zealand â and contracts with private sector accounting firms. The two business units share a Corporate Services Team.

=== Office of the Auditor-General ===
The Office of the Auditor-General carries out strategic audit planning, sets policy and standards, appoints auditors and oversees their performance, carries out performance audits, provides reporting and advice to Parliament, and carries out inquiries and other special studies.

=== Audit New Zealand ===
Audit New Zealand carries out annual audits allocated by the Auditor-General. It also provides other assurance services to public entities, within the Auditor-Generalâs mandate and in keeping with the Auditor-Generalâs Auditing Standard on the independence of auditors.

Audit New Zealand's auditors examine the financial statements of public entities and handle special governance, risk, and contract and project management assignments. Audit New Zealand has specialist Tax Audit and Information Systems Assurance Audit teams.

==International liaison and involvement==
The Auditor-General is currently the Secretary General of the [http://www.pasai.org Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions] (PASAI). PASAI is the official association of Supreme Audit Institutions (government Audit Offices and similar organisations, known as SAIs) in the Pacific. PASAI is one of the regional working groups belonging to the [http://intosai.org International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions] (INTOSAI).

The Auditor-General is a member of INTOSAI, and also contributes to the international auditing community by accepting requests to host delegations from overseas audit offices and other government bodies.

==Auditors-General of New Zealand==
The first Auditor-General took office in 1846, and before that audit functions were carried out in the Colonial Secretaryâs Office. From 1 January 1842 until the appointment of Dr Knight in 1846, accounts were certified by a board consisting of three Commissioners of Audit. The 20th (and current) Auditor-General John Ryan took office on 2 July 2018.

The '''Dutch Language Union''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: {{Audio|Nl-Nederlandse Taalunie.ogg|''Nederlandse Taalunie''}}, NTU) is an international regulatory institution that governs issues regarding the [[Dutch language]]. It is best known for its spelling reforms which are promulgated by member states, grammar books, the [[Green Booklet]] and its support of Dutch language courses and studies worldwide. It was founded on 9 September 1980 by the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] (in respect of the [[Flemish Community]]). [[Suriname]] has been an associate member of the ''Taalunie'' since 2004.

==History==
[[File:Map Dutch World scris.png|left|thumb|290px|The Dutch-speaking world.]]
The Dutch Language Union was established by a treaty between Belgium and the Netherlands, signed on 9 September 1980 in Brussels. It succeeded the "Cultural Agreement" (governing more than just language) between the two countries signed just after the Second World War. This agreement was redone in 1995, after the [[State reform in Belgium|federalization of Belgium]], and a new treaty was signed between the Netherlands and [[Flanders]].&lt;ref name=Willemijns176&gt;Willemyns 176.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 2003, president of the Committee of Ministers of the Dutch Language Union [[Medy van der Laan]] and Minister of Education of Suriname [[Walter Sandriman]] signed the agreement to the accession of Suriname to the union. The accession was ratified by the [[National Assembly (Suriname)|National Assembly of Suriname]] in 2004 and came into force in 2005.&lt;ref name="Suriname"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taalunie.org/organisatie/samenwerking-tussen-nederlandse-taalunie-en-suriname |title=Suriname, lid van de Taalunie |website=Nederlandse Taalunie |accessdate=19 June 2014 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard Dutch (''Algemeen Nederlands'', often abbreviated to ''AN'') is the [[standard language]] as it is taught in schools and used by authorities in the Netherlands, [[Flanders]], Suriname, and the [[Netherlands Antilles|Dutch Caribbean]]. The Dutch Language Union defines what is ''AN'' and what is not. Since efforts to "uplift" people came to be considered rather presumptuous, the earlier name ''Algemeen Beschaafd Nederlands'' ("Common Civilised Dutch") and its abbreviation, ''ABN'', have been replaced with ''Algemeen Nederlands'' and thus ''AN''. The implicit insinuation that people speaking dialects or with an accent were not civilised was thus removed.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Word list==
[[File:Groene Boekje 1954.png|thumb|''Groene Boekje'' (1954)]]
An important change that was carried out by the Dutch Language Union was the [[History_of_Dutch_orthography#The_spelling_reform_of_1996_.28The_Netherlands_and_Flanders.29|modification]] of [[Dutch orthography]] in 1995, regarding in particular the writing of the [[interfix]] ''-n'' in many [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]]. Among the Unionâs publications is the well-known [[Word list of the Dutch language]] (''Woordenlijst Nederlandse taal''), commonly known as the â''Groene boekje''â ("''Green booklet''", because of its distinctive green colour). The green booklet is the official orthographic and grammatical reference of the Dutch language. It is laid out like a vocabulary, including plural forms and spelling but without actual word definitions.

The most recent version of the Green Booklet appeared on 13 October 2015. Its content does not differ from the previous version of 2005, which included a somewhat controversial spelling reform which was not received well in general because a part of the spelling reforms of 1996 was changed again. In December 2005, most of the Dutch mainstream media announced a boycott. In August 2006, they released a 'White book' as their own, subtly different guideline. Currently these two spellings are both in use, sometimes confusing people; the 'green' one is used by schools and officials, the 'white' one by papers, magazines and television stations. 

In Belgium, on the other hand, the spelling reform was generally accepted without protest.

==Dictionary==
The [[Van Dale]] dictionary is commonly accepted as the most authoritative [[Dutch dictionary]]. Commonly named the [[Dikke Van Dale]] ("fat Van Dale" due to its size) the dictionary is split into three tomes (AâI, JâR, SâZ) and is usually updated every 7â8 years. The 15th edition was published on 23 September 2015.

The ''[[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal]]'' ('''''WNT''''') is a historic dictionary that includes all words used from 1500 to the present day.
 
Work began in 1864 and was finished in 1998 when the last volume was published. It has 43 volumes, needing about 3m if placed on a shelf, with about 400,000 words on 49,255 pages. In 2001, three additional volumes were published containing mostly words from the 20th century that were not included in the previous 43 volumes. This dictionary is published by Instituut voor Nederlandse Lexicologie and can be found online.

== Dutch as a foreign language ==
The Dutch Language Union supports the teaching of Dutch in primary and secondary schools in the neighbouring regions and countries. It concerns [[Belgium]] ([[Brussels]] and [[Wallonia]]; 350,000 learners), [[Germany]] ([[Lower Saxony]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], 40,000 learners) and [[France]] ([[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], 8,000 learners). 

The Union also supports the study of [[Dutch language]] and [[Culture of the Netherlands|culture]] at universities and schools worldwide. Approximately 14,000 people study Dutch language and literature at 140 institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://taalunieversum.org/sectie/nederlands-internationaal |title=Nederlands internationaal |website=Taalunieversum |language=nl |access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
===Internal organisation===
The NTU has offices in The Hague and Brussels, and it comprises four institutions:
*The Secretariat-General, responsible for preparing and implementing policy, headed by Hans Bennis since 2017
*The Committee of Ministers, containing the ministers of education and culture from the Netherlands and [[Flanders]];
*The Interparliamentary Commission, made up of members of the Dutch and Flemish parliaments;
*The Council for Dutch Language and Literature.&lt;ref&gt;Willemyns 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Instituut voor de Nederlandse Taal}}''Instituut voor de Nederlandse Taal''====
The binational (Belgium and the Netherlands) ''Instituut voor de Nederlandse Taal'' ("Institute for the Dutch Language") in Leiden, formerly ''Instituut voor Nederlandse Lexicologie'', works under the auspices of the Dutch Language Union, and is responsible for the ''[[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal]]'' (Dictionary of the Dutch language).&lt;ref&gt;Willemyns 125.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the institute publishes a number of dictionaries, including the ''Old Dutch Dictionary'', the ''Early Middle Dutch Dictionary'', and an etymological dictionary; and databases, including databases indexing various newspapers and magazines, and legal documents. The ''Spoken Dutch Corpus'' has contemporary Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands and Flanders, including audio recordings of Standard Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Willemyns 177â78.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Royal Academy of Dutch language and literature====
The [[Royal Academy of Dutch language and literature]] was founded in Belgium in 1886 to stimulate the culture and literature of Flanders. It is the official advisory board to the Flanders government, and publishes the ''Materiaal Willems'' database, based on the dialect surveys done by Pieter Willems, containing material from dialects in Flanders, the Netherlands, and [[French Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Willemyns 178-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===External connections===
The organisation is also responsible for the external linguistic policy of the Netherlands and Flanders and is active in [[Indonesia]] and [[South Africa]], two countries with historic links with the Dutch language. Nevertheless, cooperation with South Africa is not limited to the [[Afrikaans]] language but aimed also at fostering multilingualism.{{cn|date=June 2012}}

The purposes of the organisation are limited to Dutch language and Dutch-language literature, and are hence not as wide as those of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], [[La Francophonie]] or the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The Treaty on the Dutch Language Union foresees the possibility that the Kingdom of the Netherlands extends application to NTU member's parts outside Europe. The organs of the NTU are its Committee of Ministers (composed of the ministers of education and culture of the Dutch and Flemish Governments), its Secretariat-General, an Interparliamentary Committee (composed of members of the [[States General of the Netherlands]] and the [[Flemish Parliament]]) and a Dutch Language and Literature Council (composed of twelve independent experts). There are specific arrangements for the participation of Suriname in the organisation's inner workings.

===Member states===
As the basis of the Taalunie is a treaty between the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and the [[Kingdom of Belgium]], the two sovereign states that constitute the Union. For the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the treaty is only applicable to its [[Netherlands|European territory]].
The treaty allows for two types of extensions:
* membership of other sovereign states through an "association membership"&lt;ref name=verdrag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBV0002947/geldigheidsdatum_16-04-2011|title=Verdrag tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en het Koninkrijk Belgie inzake de Nederlandse Taalunie, Brussel|date=1980-09-09|language=Dutch|work=Netherlands government portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* extension to other territories of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (presently: [[Aruba]], [[CuraÃ§ao]], [[Sint-Maarten]] and the [[Caribbean Netherlands]]).&lt;ref name=verdrag/&gt;

In 2004, Suriname signed an "associative treaty" with the Taalunie.&lt;ref name="Suriname"/&gt; From 27 November 2013 the treaty also applies to the [[Caribbean Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/trb-2013-253.html|language=Dutch|title=Tractatenblad 2013, 253|publisher=Kingdom of the Netherlands|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The three autonomous Caribbean countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, [[Aruba]], [[CuraÃ§ao]] and [[Sint Maarten]], are designated as candidate member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taalunieversum.org/taalunie/wie_zijn_wij/|language=Dutch|title=Wie we zijn: Drie landen, Ã©Ã©n taal|publisher=Nederlandse Taalunie|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Indonesia]] and [[South Africa]] are considered "special partners" of the Dutch Language Union.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}
'''Electoral fusion''' is an arrangement where two or more [[Political party|political parties]] on a [[ballot]] list the same [[candidate]], pooling the votes for that candidate. Distinct from the process of [[electoral alliance]]s in that the political parties remain separately listed on the ballot, the practice of electoral fusion in [[jurisdiction]]s where it exists allows minor parties to influence election results and policy by offering to endorse or nominate a major party's candidate.

Electoral fusion is also known as fusion voting, cross endorsement, multiple party nomination, multi-party nomination, plural nomination, and ballot freedom.&lt;ref name="What is Fusion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonwfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Whatisfusion.pdf |title=What is Fusion |publisher=Oregon Working Families Party |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415131853/http://oregonwfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Whatisfusion.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brief for appellant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizen.org/litigation/article_redirect.cfm?ID=666 |title=Brief for appellant: Twin Cities Area New Party vs Secretary of State of Minnesota |publisher=Public Citizen Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
Electoral fusion is very common in Brazil.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Hong Kong==
While no party law exists in Hong Kong, candidates in election may list their "political affiliation" on ballots, and there is no restriction regarding the number of political parties or organisations a candidate report to be affiliated with. For example, in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2004|2004]] Legislative Council election [[Chan Kam Lam]], of the [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]], and [[Chan Yuen Han]] (unrelated), of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions]], running on different [[pro-Beijing]] tickets in the same multi-member constituency, were endorsed by both parties.

==Italy==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
Electoral fusion is provided for and regulated by the [[Italian Parliament#Electoral system|Italian electoral system]] for [[general election]]s, in order to get a [[majority bonus]]. However the parties can run as stand-alones.

That is also provided for [[administrative division]]s, to get the majority bonus in support of the [[candidate]] who gets the relative chief office.

==Netherlands==
The Dutch electoral law accepts common lists. In a common list two or more political parties share a list and often have a common political programme for the election. The participating political parties are identifiable for the voters because the names of these parties are mentioned on the voting paper.

==Philippines==
In the [[Philippine presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential elections]], Senator [[Loren Legarda]] announced her bid for vice president and was announced as running mate of [[Nacionalista Party]] presidentiable Senator [[Manny Villar]].

==United States==
Electoral fusion was once widespread in the [[United States]]. In the late nineteenth century, however, as minor political parties such as the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] became increasingly successful in using fusion, state legislatures enacted bans against it.  One Republican Minnesota state legislator was clear about what his party was trying to do: "We don't propose to allow the Democrats to make allies of the Populists, Prohibitionists, or any other party, and get up combination tickets against us.  We can whip them single-handed, but don't intend to fight all creation."&lt;ref&gt;''Spoiling for a Fight'', 227-228&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation of the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] made this particular tactical position obsolete. By 1907 the practice had been banned in 18 states; today, fusion as conventionally practiced remains legal in only eight states, namely:
*[[California]] (Presidential elections only)
*[[Connecticut]]
*[[Delaware]]
*[[Idaho]]
*[[Mississippi]]
*[[New York (state)|New York]]
*[[Oregon]]
*[[South Carolina]]
*[[Vermont]]

In several other states,{{which|date=January 2014}} notably [[New Hampshire]], fusion is legal when primary elections are won by write-in candidates.

Fusion has sometimes been used by other third parties. For example, the [[Independent Party of Oregon]] cross-nominated five major party candidates, winning races for the U.S. Senate, Oregon State Treasurer, and the Oregon House of Representatives in 2008.  The [[Libertarian Party of New Hampshire]] used fusion to elect four members, [[Calvin Warburton]], [[Finlay Rothhaus]], [[Andy Borsa]] and [[Don Gorman]], to the [[New Hampshire]] state legislature during the early 1990s.

In [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864]] the Democratic Party split into two wings over the question of whether to continue the [[American Civil War]] or back down and negotiate peace with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The [[War Democrats]] fused with the Republicans to elect a Democratic Vice President, [[Andrew Johnson]], and re-elect a Republican President, [[Abraham Lincoln]].

In [[United States presidential election, 1872|1872]], both the newly formed [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]] and the Democratic party nominated the Liberal Republican [[Horace Greeley]] as their candidate for President of the United States: "If [The Democratic party] was to stand any chance at all against Grant, it must avoid putting up a candidate of its own who would merely split the opposition vote. It must take Greeley."&lt;ref&gt;Hale, William Harlan (1950). Horace Greeley: Voice of the People. Harper &amp; Brothers. {{OCLC|336934}}. p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 1896|Presidential election of 1896]], [[William Jennings Bryan]] was nominated by both the Democratic Party and the Populist Party, albeit with different Vice Presidential candidates, [[Arthur Sewall]] for the Democrats and [[Thomas E. Watson]] for the Populists. This election led to the downfall of the Populist Party, especially in Southern states (such as Watson's Georgia, as well as North Carolina and Tennessee) where the Populist party had engaged in electoral fusion or other alliances with Republicans against the dominant [[Bourbon Democrat]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Occasionally, popular candidates for local office have succeeded in being nominated by both Republican and Democratic Parties.  In 1946, prior to the current ban on fusion being enacted in that state, Republican [[Governor of California]] [[Earl Warren]] (a future [[Chief Justice of the United States]]) managed to win the nominations of the Republican, Democratic, and Progressive Parties.  Similarly, [[Allan Shivers]] won the 1952 nominations of both the Democratic and Republican parties in Texas (and had his name appear on the ballot twice, once for each party; Democrat Shivers handily defeated Republican Shivers in the general election).

In 1996 the United States Supreme Court ruled that prohibiting Electoral Fusion does not violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution (''[[Twin Cities Area New Party v. McKenna]]'', 73 F. 3d 196, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/95-1608.ZS.html| title=Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party (95-1608), 520 U.S. 351 (1997)| publisher=Legal Information Institute/Cornell| accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Trump]] appeared on the [[United States presidential election in California, 2016|2016 presidential ballot in California]] with two ballot labels by his name,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Winger, [http://ballot-access.org/2016/08/13/american-independent-party-formally-nominates-donald-trump-and-michael-pence/ American Independent Party Formally Nominates Donald Trump and Michael Pence], ''Ballot Access News'' (August 13, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; as the nominee of both the Republican Party and the [[American Independent Party]], a small [[far-right]] party.  Trump was the first fusion presidential candidate on the California ballot in at least eighty years.&lt;ref&gt;John Myers, [http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-donald-trump-california-ballot-american-independent-party-20160815-snap-story.html Donald Trump will be the nominee of two parties on California's November ballot], ''Los Angeles Times'' (August 15, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milwaukee===
In [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], during the heyday of the [[Sewer Socialism|Sewer Socialists]], the Republican and Democratic parties would agree not to run candidates against each other in some districts, concentrating instead on defeating the Socialists. These candidates were usually called "[[nonpartisan#Milwaukee|non-partisan]]", but sometimes were termed "fusion" candidates instead.&lt;ref&gt;"Fusion In Many Districts; Old Parties Unite On Legislative Candidates" ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' November 1, 1918; p. 9, col. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===
{{See also|Elections in New York|Qualified New York Parties}}

Fusion has the highest profile in New York City, where it was used as a major weapon against [[Tammany Hall]].  Most legislative and [[New York Supreme Court#Elections|judicial elections]] are won by candidates endorsed by more than two parties.

The first fusion gubernatorial election was held in New York in 1854, in which the major party Whig candidate was supported in a fusion candidacy by eleven other political parties, among them the "Strong-Minded Women" Party, the "Anti-Rent" Party and the "Negro" Party.

In order to obtain or maintain automatic ballot access, a party's candidate for [[governor of New York]] must receive 50,000 votes on that party's line. The party need not run its own candidate and may cross-nominate another party's candidate, but in order to qualify for automatic ballot access it must receive 50,000 votes on its own line. Gubernatorial vote also determines [[ballot order]], with Row "A" going to the party whose line gains the most votes (regardless of whether or not their candidate actually wins &amp;ndash; see the [[New York gubernatorial election, 1994|1994 election]] for an example).

Automatic ballot access means that no petitions need be filed to gain access to a ballot line for statewide and special elections, and parties may designate candidates through their own conventions. (Legislative candidates must petition onto the ballot regardless of party designation.)  For local (non-statewide) office, the number of signatures required to place a candidate on the ballot is much lower for qualified parties, and they are the only parties eligible to hold primary elections. Automatic ballot access is valid for four years, and parties must gain 50,000 votes in the next gubernatorial election to again qualify for automatic ballot access.

Small parties significant in large part for their fused ballot lines, include the [[Independence Party of New York]], the [[Working Families Party]], and the [[Conservative Party of New York State]].  The Independence Party originally ran its own candidate for governor until 2002, but since then has instead retained its automatic ballot status by running a gubernatorial candidate who was designated by one of the major parties (to date, the party has always cross-endorsed the Democrat in gubernatorial races; it cross-endorses Republicans in lower races, particularly in the [[New York State Senate]], whose Republican conference has strong ties to the party).  Previously influential were the [[Liberal Party of New York]] and [[New York State Right to Life Party]], which lost automatic [[ballot access]] in 2002.

Other parties, such as the [[Libertarian Party of New York]], the [[Green Party of New York]], and others, now seek ballot access by, first, getting a gubernatorial candidate on the ballot via [[petition]] (by collecting 15,000 valid signatures of [[registered voters]]), and then by getting 50,000 votes for that candidate on their line. As a general rule, neither party uses electoral fusion, and both rely on their own candidates. The Green Party, which had first achieved ballot status in 1998, failed to gain 50,000 votes and also lost its ballot status in 2002, but regained its line when the 2010 election results were certified. To date, the Libertarian Party has never gained the 50,000 votes needed (it only came close once, with [[Warren Redlich]]'s 48,000-vote performance in 2010; no other Libertarian ballot has earned half of that).

The Liberal Party, which had been active since 1944, became defunct as a result of the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2002|2002 gubernatorial election]]. [[Andrew Cuomo]] got the Liberal Party nomination and ran in the Democratic primary against [[Carl McCall]], who had secured the Working Families nomination.  Cuomo subsequently dropped out and endorsed McCall, but his name remained on the Liberal party line and failed to gain 50,000 votes, leading to the Liberal Party's failure to retain status and losing its automatic ballot line.  A Federal lawsuit (joined by Green, Libertarian, and other parties) enjoined the Board of Elections from discarding enrollment records of these disqualified parties, and also required modifications to allow voters to register themselves in non-ballot parties.

===Oregon===
Prior to 1958, Oregon practiced a form of fusion that required the state to list multiple nominating parties on the candidate's ballot line. [[Sylvester Pennoyer]] was elected Governor in 1886 and 1890 as a candidate of the Democratic and People's Parties.  In 1906, seven members of the Oregon House were also elected as candidates of the [[Populist Party (United States)|People's Party]] and either the Democratic or Republican parties.  In 2008, a lawsuit was brought by the [[Independent Party of Oregon]] against the Oregon Secretary of State claiming that modifications to the ballot design statute in 1995 once again required the state to list multiple nominating parties on the candidate's ballot line.  The lawsuit gave rise to legislation&lt;ref name="SB326"&gt;http://www.leg.state.or.us/09reg/measures/sb300.dir/sb326.a.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow candidates to list up to three party labels after their name.  This bill passed both houses of the Oregon legislature during the 2009 legislative session.  Governor [[Ted Kulongoski]] signed the bill into law on July 23, 2009.

{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}
'''English votes for English laws''' (EVEL) is a set of procedures of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] whereby legislation which affects only England requires the support of a majority of MPs representing English constituencies. The procedures were developed following [[devolution in the United Kingdom]] as a result of the [[West Lothian question]], a concern about the perceived inequity of MPs from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, sitting in the House of Commons being able to vote on matters that affected only England, while MPs from England were unable to vote on matters that had been devolved to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], the [[Scottish Parliament]] and the [[Welsh Assembly]].&lt;ref name = "hague"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29606220 |title=Hague and Brown clash over 'English votes for English laws' |quote=But [[William Hague|Mr Hague]] said the issue of "English votes for English laws", known as the West Lothian Question, had been talked about for nearly 20 years but nothing had been done. |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=14 October 2014 |accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s a number of pieces of legislation which affected only or mainly England were passed by the UK Parliament, although the votes cast by MPs were such that the legislation would not have been passed if only the votes cast by MPs representing English constituencies had been counted.&lt;ref name=feesvote&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3432767.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scots MPs attacked over fees vote | date=27 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] commissioned a report, "Devolution, The West Lothian Question and the Future of the Union", which proposed some procedural changes restricting the participation of MPs representing non-English constituencies during the passage of bills relating only to England.

While the Conservatives were in government from 2010â15 in coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], they set up the [[Commission on the consequences of devolution for the House of Commons|McKay Commission]] to look into the question. The Commission proposed that bills in the House of Commons which affected England solely or differently should require a majority vote of MPs representing English constituencies.&lt;ref name=eol&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21920010 | work=BBC News | title=England-only laws 'need majority from English MPs' | date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative manifesto for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] included a proposal that England-only legislation should require approval from a [[Legislative Grand Committee]] prior to its Third Reading in the House of Commons.&lt;ref name=evt&gt;{{cite news | title = Election 2015: PM sets out 'English votes' timetable | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 2015-04-24 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32441969 | accessdate = 2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having won a majority in that election, the Conservative government used a change in [[parliamentary procedure|standing orders]] in October 2015 to give MPs representing English constituencies a "veto" over laws only affecting England.&lt;ref name = "egc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34599998 |title=English vote plan to become law despite objections |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=22 October 2015 |accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following the establishment of the [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1999, it was suggested by Conservative MPs that Scottish MPs should be barred from voting on matters that do not affect Scotland.&lt;ref name="englishguardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/conservatives/comment/0,,1795370,00.html |title=If it's English vote for English law, the UK's end is nigh |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=12 June 2006 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1999, Conservative Party leader [[William Hague]] said that "English MPs should have exclusive say over [[English laws]]&amp;nbsp;... People will become increasingly resentful that decisions are being made in England by people from other parts of the UK on matters that English people did not have a say on elsewhere&amp;nbsp;... I think it is a dangerous thing to allow resentment to build up in a country. We have got to make the rules fair now."&lt;ref name="English votes on English laws"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/394997.stm |title=English votes on English laws |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=15 July 1999 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In establishing foundation hospitals and increasing student tuition fees in England, Scottish votes were decisive in getting the measures through.&lt;ref&gt;Gallop, Nick in The Constitution and Constitutional Reform p.27 (Philip Allan, 2011) {{ISBN|978-0-340-98720-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote on foundation hospitals in November 2003 only applied to England â had the vote been restricted to English MPs then the government would have been defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-big-question-what-is-the-west-lothian-question-and-can-it-be-resolved-satisfactorily-406571.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Andy | last=McSmith | date=4 July 2006 | title=The Big Question: What is the West Lothian question, and can it be resolved satisfactorily?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had there been a vote by English MPs only on tuition fees in January 2004, the government would have lost because of a rebellion on their own benches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=1|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/uk/The-West-Lothian-Question-Labour.3538800.jp |title=The West Lothian Question: Labour MPs want answers |publisher=thescotsman.com |date=19 November 2007 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students at English universities are required to pay [[top-up fees]], but students from Scotland attending Scottish universities are not. The legislation imposing top-up fees on students in England passed by a small majority of 316 to 311. At the time, the shadow education secretary [[Tim Yeo]] argued that this low majority made the passing of the law "completely wrong" due to Scottish MPs voting to introduce tuition fees that Scottish students attending university in Scotland would not have to pay.&lt;ref name=feesvote/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3434329.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blair wins key top-up fees vote | date=27 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small part of the bill did relate directly to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A13484928 | work=BBC h2g2 | title=Scottish Devolution and West Lothian Question | date=19 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his election as Leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 2005, [[David Cameron]] established a "Democracy Taskforce" chaired by [[Kenneth Clarke]]. The taskforce's final report "Devolution, The [[West Lothian question]] and the Future of the Union" proposed a possible solution to the West Lothian question. The proposals called for changes in procedures in the House of Commons for the passage of bills relating only to England. Under the new procedures, all MPs would participate in the first and second [[Reading (legislature)|reading]]s of these bills, but only English MPs would participate in the committee stage consideration of the bill. All MPs would vote on the final bill at report stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toque.co.uk/witan/docs/DTF_Answering_the_Question.pdf |accessdate=23 July 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment proposed by [[Malcolm Rifkind]] suggested that the second reading and report stages of bills would require a "double majority" of both the House as a whole and of English MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toque.co.uk/witan/docs/ClarkeVRifkind.pdf |accessdate=23 July 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour politician [[Jack Straw]] has speculated: "I say to the Conservatives that if they start to take a mechanical approach, this so-called 'English votes for English laws' approach, then they will break the Union."&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/uk/The-West-Lothian-Question-Labour.3538800.jp|title=The West Lothian Question: Labour MPs want answers |accessdate=12 May 2010|publisher=The Scotsman|year=2007|author=Hamish Macdonell and Gerri Peev}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==McKay Commission==
{{see also|Commission on the consequences of devolution for the House of Commons}}
The May 2010 coalition agreement between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] provided for a commission to be established to consider the West Lothian question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.com/News/News_stories/2010/05/Coalition_Agreement_published.aspx|title=Share The Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, the Government announced that the commission would be established in the near future and that it would consist of "independent, non-partisan experts". The new commission would examine how the House of Commons and Parliament as a whole could deal with business that affects only England and is devolved in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The commission would not look at reducing the number of MPs from the other three constituent countries or financing of the devolved institutions.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14831619|title=Answer sought to the West Lothian question|date=8 September 2011|publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The McKay Commission reported on 25 March 2013.&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite report| url=http://tmc.independent.gov.uk/report-of-the-commission-on-the-consequences-of-devolution-for-the-house-of-commons | title=Report of McKay Commission | date= 25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnews250313&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21920010 |work=BBC News |title=England-only laws 'need majority from English MPs' |publisher=BBC |date=25 March 2013 |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that changes were needed because of the perception that England was disadvantaged under the current devolution arrangements, and proposed that Commons decisions with a "separate and distinct effect" for England should "normally be taken only with the consent of a majority of MPs sitting for constituencies in England". This principle should be enshrined by a resolution of the House of Commons. The Commission also proposed a number of changes to procedure, including allocating specific parliamentary time to proposals for England. The government said it would give the report "serious consideration".&lt;ref name=eol/&gt;

On 18 September 2014, the people of Scotland voted against [[Scottish independence|independence]] in a [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum]] by 55.3% to 44.7%. Shortly after the outcome of the vote was announced, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], David Cameron, stated that the "question of English votes for English laws â the so-called West Lothian question â requires a decisive answer." He announced the appointment of [[Robert Smith, Baron Smith of Kelvin|Lord Smith]] to lead a [[Smith Commission|commission]] to develop proposals for constitutional reform to be included in a Bill to be published in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29271763|title=David Cameron sets out UK-wide changes 'to build better future' |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] refused to engage in cross party discussions about the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29606220 |title=Labour rules out talks on 'English votes for English laws' |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments after the 2015 general election==
{{see also|Legislative Grand Committee}}
The governance of England featured in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] manifestos of the three main political parties in England. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] manifesto supported the idea of "English Votes for English Laws", with England-only legislation requiring approval from a [[Legislative Grand Committee]] prior to its Third Reading. In the case of legislation applying to both England and Wales, or to England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Legislative Grand Committee would consist of MPs from both England and Wales or England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It proposed a separate English rate of Income Tax and rejected regional governance in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/manifesto2015/ConservativeManifesto2015.pdf|title=The Conservative Party Manifesto 2015|publisher=The Conservative Party|page=49|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Election 2015: Tory pledge over English laws veto condemned in Scotland | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 2015-04-14 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32306447 | accessdate = 2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=evt/&gt;

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] manifesto stated that it was time to "consider how English MPs can have a greater role in scrutiny of legislation that only affects England" and suggested that an English Grand Committee stage for legislation could be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain can be better: The Labour Party Manifesto 2015|publisher=The Labour Party|url=http://www.labour.org.uk/page/-/BritainCanBeBetter-TheLabourPartyManifesto2015.pdf|accessdate=12 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609190256/http://www.labour.org.uk/page/-/BritainCanBeBetter-TheLabourPartyManifesto2015.pdf|archive-date=2017-06-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] manifesto proposed that England-only legislation be considered by a committee of MPs with membership based on share of the vote in England. It proposed a system of "Devolution on Demand" where councils or groups of councils could request further powers from Central Government. It supported the principle of an assembly for Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/complete-manifesto|title=The Complete Manifesto|work=Liberal Democrats}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservatives won an overall majority in the election and formed the government of the United Kingdom. On 2 July 2015, [[Chris Grayling]], [[Leader of the House of Commons]], announced proposals to change [[Parliamentary procedure|standing orders]] to give MPs representing English constituencies a new "veto" over laws only affecting England. On 9 July 2015, Grayling said that, following two days of debate in July, a final set of standing orders would be tabled and voted on after the summer recess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =  Watt  | first =  Nicholas | title = English votes for English laws plan to be revised after Commons revolt  | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2015-07-09 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/09/english-votes-english-laws-plan-revised-conservatives-dup | accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour said the "reckless and shoddy" plans had descended into "chaos" while the SNP said it was a "shambles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = English votes for English laws plan to be delayed | publisher =BBC |work=BBC News | date = 2015-07-09 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33462204 | accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new procedures were approved by a Commons vote in October 2015&lt;ref name = "egc"/&gt; and used for the first time in the House of Commons in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35295404|title='English votes' rules used for first time in House of Commons|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=12 January 2016|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-01-12/english-votes-for-english-laws-is-driving-scotland-out-of-the-uk-snp-mp-claims/|title=English votes for English laws 'is driving Scotland out' of the UK, SNP MP claims|publisher=[[ITV News]]|last=Wiener|first=Libby|date=12 January 2016|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016 the Centre on Constitutional Change published a report on the operation of the procedures during their first year, arguing that EVEL has avoided many of the problems predicted by its critics and recommending some improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One year of EVEL: evaluating âEnglish votes for English lawsâ in the House of Commons|url=https://constitution-unit.com/2016/11/28/one-year-of-evel-evaluating-english-votes-for-english-laws-in-the-house-of-commons/|publisher=The Constitution Unit blog|date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]], the Conservative Party lost its House of Commons majority, but had a majority of 60 on English issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Jeremy Corbyn has won a great victory â and so have the Liberal Democrats|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/june2017/2017/06/jeremy-corbyn-has-won-great-victory-and-so-have-liberal-democrats|date= 9 June 2017|author=Stephen Bush|magazine=New Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Commission communautaire franÃ§aise''''' ('''COCOF''') or the '''French Community Commission''' is the local representative of the [[French language|French]]-speaking authorities in the [[Brussels-Capital Region]], one of the three regions of [[Belgium]].

On 3 December 2001, the ''AssemblÃ©e de la Commission communautaire franÃ§aise'' or ''ACCF'' (Assembly of the French Community Commission) informally changed its name to ''Parlement francophone bruxellois'' (French-speaking Brussels Parliament). The Parliament is currently presided by [[Christos Doulkeridis]].

Unlike the [[Flemish Community Commission]], the French Community Commission has been granted legislative power in some areas (such as tourism and healthcare) by the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]].

''Gentio'' and ''Gentoo'' terms were applied historically to [[indigenous peoples]] of India; later, to [[Telugu people|Telugu-speaking persons]] and [[Telugu language|their language]] in then [[Madras Presidency|Madras Province]] (now the [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] region), as opposed to the [[Malbars]], or [[Tamil people|Tamil speakers]] and [[Tamil language|their language]] (in what is now [[Tamil Nadu]]).&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4410294?uid=3738256&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=47698761089207 |title= Situating the Gentoo in History |publisher=  |accessdate= March 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R7"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/lr/2002/03/03/stories/2002030300300300.htm |title= Origins of `India' |author=Anand |publisher= hindu.com |accessdate= March 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example from the Monsignor Sebastiao Rodolfo Dalgado is "moros, gentivos e maos christÃ£os".&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;

According to the Oxford English Dictionary Gentoo was an Anglo-Indian term |publisher= thehindu.com |accessdate= March 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

It is unclear why Indians were called ''Gentoo''. As [[Portuguese people]] arrived in India for trade, [[religious conversion]]s, and [[colonisation]] before other Europeans, it is possible that the word was derived from the Portuguese word ''Gentio'': a gentile, a heathen, or native. The Portuguese also appear to have used it to distinguish the aborigines of India from [[Muslim]]s, the [[Moro people|Moros]] or [[Moors]].&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R10"/&gt;
{{quote|And before this kingdom of Guzerate fell into the hands of the Moors, a certain race of Gentios whom the moors called Resbutos dwelt therein.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;}}

According to 19th century philologist and Orientalist [[Nathaniel Brassey Halhed|N.B. Halhed]], there was a fanciful [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] of ''Gentoo'' from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''jantu'', meaning "mankind" or "animal".&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;

The word [[Hindu]] is not originally Indian. Instead, the word ''Hindu'' started to acquire religious connotations only after the arrival of [[Muslim]]s. The very first attempt by the British to establish social laws over aboriginal people for administrative purposes (in order to assert the distinctiveness of Indian jurisprudence) was named ''[[Gentoo Code|A Code of Gentoo Law]]''. The first digest of Indian legislation was published in 1776, was funded by the [[East India Company]], supported by [[Warren Hastings]], and was translated from [[Persian language|Persian]] into [[English language|English]] by [[Nathaniel Brassey Halhed|Halhed]].&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R7"/&gt;
{{quote|The Gentues, the portugal idiom for Gentiles, are the Aborgines, who enjoyed their freedom, till the Moors or Scythian Tartars... undermining them, took advantage of the civil Commotions.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;}}

After the term ''Hindu'' as a religion was established to represent non-Muslims and non-Christians, the word ''Gentoo'' became archaic and then obsolete, while its application on [[Telugu people]] and [[Telugu language]] (present Andhra region, part of [[Andhra Pradesh]]) in then [[Madras Province]] continued to distinguish them from [[Tamil people]] and [[Tamil language]] or [[Malbars]] (''present'': Tamil Nadu) in then Madras Province.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;

}}
In [[legislatures]], a '''hemicycle''' is a [[Semicircle|semicircular]], or [[horseshoe]]-shaped, [[debating chamber]] (''plenary chamber''), where [[Member of Parliament|deputies (members)]] sit to discuss and pass [[legislation]]. Although originally of Ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] roots, the term and modern design derive from [[French language|French]] politics and practice.

==Usage==
The circular shape is designed to encourage consensus among [[political parties]] rather than confrontation, such as in the [[Palace of Westminster]], where the government and opposition parties face each other on opposing sets of benches.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The design is used in most European countries (and hence was adopted by the [[European Parliament]]) and the United States. 

The [[United Kingdom]], which is the originator of the Westminster system, does not use a hemicycle. However, two of the three devolved legislatures, the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[Welsh Assembly]], do use hemicycles; the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] does not use a hemicycle format.

==Arrangement==
In the case of Australia (pictured below), the two largest parties still face each other, whereas in the Scottish Parliament's hemicycle, the largest party sits in the middle. However, some hemicycles follow a strict left-right arrangement with, for example, a left wing governing party sitting on the left and the right wing opposition on the right. In these cases election results are often portrayed in the hemicycle to show the results of left wing or right wing coalitions (reaching 50% in the centre, where centrist third parties are located) for the formation of a majority.

==Alternative variations==
Some [[Westminster system|Westminster-system]] countries outside the UK, such as [[India]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], have confrontational benches, but the end segment is curved to create a partial hemicycle, while other countries, such as the [[People's Republic of China]], have a single set of benches facing towards a stage area (which reflects the one-party system in operation there).

{{nihongo|'''Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park'''|åºå³¶å¹³åè¨å¿µå¬å|Hiroshima Heiwa Kinen KÅen}} is a memorial park in the center of [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]. It is dedicated to the legacy of Hiroshima as the first city in the world to suffer a [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear attack]], and to the memories of the bomb's direct and indirect victims (of whom there may have been as many as 140,000). The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is visited by thousands of people each year. The park is there in memory of the victims of the nuclear attack on August 6, 1945. On August 6, 1945 the US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima Japan.&lt;ref name="rerf-deaths"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rerf.or.jp/general/qa_e/qa1.html |title = Frequently Asked Questions #1 |publisher= [[Radiation Effects Research Foundation]] | accessdate = 2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was planned and designed by the Japanese Architect [[KenzÅ Tange]] at Tange Lab.

The location of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was once the cityâs busiest downtown commercial and residential district. The park was built on an open field that was created by the explosion. Today there are a number of memorials and monuments, museums, and lecture halls, which draw over a million visitors annually. The annual 6 August [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony|Peace Memorial Ceremony]], which is sponsored by the city of Hiroshima, is also held in the park.&lt;ref name="yoneyama"&gt;{{cite book |title= Hiroshima Traces |last= Yoneyama |first= Lisa |year= 1999 |publisher= University of California |location= Los Angeles |isbn= 0520085868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the Peace Memorial Park is to not only memorialize the victims, but also to establish the memory of nuclear horrors and advocate world peace.&lt;ref name="benedict"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=530130231&amp;sid=7&amp;Fmt=4&amp;clientId=9148&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD |title= the myth of the vanquished: the hiroshima peace memorial museum |accessdate=2007-12-02 |last= giamo |first= benedict |date= Dec 2003 |publisher= college park }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A-Bomb Dome===
{{main|A-Bomb Dome}}
The [[A-Bomb Dome]] is the skeletal ruins of the former Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. It is the building closest to the [[hypocenter]] of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear bomb]] that remained at least partially standing. It was left how it was after the bombing in memory of the casualties. The A-Bomb Dome, to which a sense of sacredness and transcendence has been attributed, is situated in a distant ceremonial view that is visible from the Peace Memorial Parkâs central [[cenotaph]].

A marker was placed on the A-Bomb Dome on April 25, 1997 by Hiroshima City. It reads:

{{quote|As a historical witness that conveys the tragedy of suffering the first atomic bomb in human history and as a symbol that vows to faithfully seek the abolition of nuclear weapons and everlasting world peace, Genbaku Dome was added to the World Heritage List in accordance with the "Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (World Heritage Convention)."

===Children's Peace Monument===
{{main|Children's Peace Monument}}
The [[Children's Peace Monument]] is a statue dedicated to the memory of the children who died as a result of the bombing. The statue is of a girl with outstretched arms with a [[origami|folded paper crane]] rising above her. The statue is based on the true story of {{nihongo|[[Sadako Sasaki]]|ä½ãæ¨ç¦å­|Sasaki Sadako}}, a young girl who died from radiation from the bomb. She believed that if she folded 1,000 paper cranes she would be cured. To this day, people (mostly children) from around the world fold cranes and send them to Hiroshima where they are placed near the statue. The statue has a continuously replenished collection of folded cranes nearby.&lt;ref name="virtual_museum "&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/frame/Virtual_e/tour_e/guide1.html |title = Virtual museum |publisher= Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hiroshima Resthouse 2008 01.JPG|thumb|250px|The Rest House of Hiroshima Peace Park]]

===Rest House===
The Rest House of Hiroshima Peace Park is another atomic bombed building in the park. The building was built as the Taishoya [[Kimono]] Shop in March 1929. It was used as a fuel distribution station when the shortage of fuel began in June 1944. On August 6, 1945, when the bomb exploded, the roof was crushed, the interior destroyed, and everything consumable burned except in the basement. Eventually, 36 people in the building died of the bombing; 47-year-old Eizo Nomura survived in the basement, which had a concrete roof through which radiation had a more difficult time penetrating.&lt;ref name="pcf.city.hiroshima.jp"&gt;http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_e/exhibit_e/exh0203_e/exh02033_e.html&lt;/ref&gt; He survived into his 80s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www5d.biglobe.ne.jp/~LLLtrs/PhotoGlryMain/pgc/Hiroshima01a.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japanfocus.org/-elin_o_Hara-slavick/3196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kombe-jarvis.com/japan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013191113/http://www.kombe-jarvis.com/japan.html |archivedate=2013-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Nakajima District, which today is Peace Memorial Park, was a prominent business quarter of the city during the early years of the Showa period (1926â89) and had been the site of many wooden two-story structures. However, in 1929, the three-story Taishoya Kimono Shop was constructed, surrounded by shops and movie theaters.&lt;ref name="hiroshimapeacemedia.jp"&gt;http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/mediacenter/article.php?story=20110907144912375_en&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that if you went up to the roof, a panoramic view of the city awaited. In 1943 the Kimono Shop was closed and in June 1944, as World War II intensified and economic controls became increasingly stringent, the building was purchased by the Prefectural Fuel Rationing Union

At 8:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on August 6, 1945, the explosion of the atomic bomb about 600 meters above the hypocenter destroyed the buildingâs concrete roof. The interior was also badly damaged and gutted by ensuing fires, and everyone inside was killed except Nomura, who miraculously survived. The building was restored soon after the war and used as the Fuel Hall. In 1957, the Hiroshima East Reconstruction Office, which became the core the cityâs reconstruction program, was established there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/index_e2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Basement of the Rest House.jpg|thumb|The Basement of the Rest House]]

At the time of the bombing, 37 people were working there. All of them perished, with the exception of Eizo Nomura, who had gone down to the basement at that moment and survived the bombing. Nomura, who was then 47,  was a worker for the Hiroshima Prefectural Fuel Rationing Union. Nomura managed to escape through rising fire and vigorous smoke. However, after his survival, he struggled with high fever, diarrhea, bleeding gums, and other symptoms caused by the radiation.&lt;ref name="pcf.city.hiroshima.jp" /&gt;

Although the building was heavily damaged, it stood still and was renovated soon after the war, including a new wooden roof. After the war, the Hiroshima municipal government purchased the building and established a postwar recovery office in it. Today it is used as the Rest House in Peace Memorial Park.
The Rest House has been in debates many times over whether or not it should be preserved. In 1995, the city decided to demolish the building, but the plan was put aside. One of the reasons was because of the announcement of the A-Bomb Dome as a World Heritage site.&lt;ref name="hiroshimapeacemedia.jp" /&gt;

Right now, the first floor of the Rest House is used as a tourist information office and a souvenir shop, the second/third floors as offices, and the basement is preserved nearly as it was at the time of the bombing.

==Ceremonies==

===Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony===
{{main|Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony}}
Every year on 6 August, "A-Bomb Day," the City of Hiroshima holds the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony]] to console the victims of the atomic bombs and to pray for the realization of lasting world peace. The ceremony is held in the morning from 8:00, in front of the Memorial Cenotaph with many citizens including the families of the deceased. During the ceremony, a one-minute silence to honor the victims is observed at 8:15, the time of the atomic bomb's explosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.hiroshima.jp/shimin/shimin/shikiten/shikiten-e.html Peace Memorial Ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.hiroshima.jp/shimin/shimin/shikiten/shidai-e.html Peace Memorial Ceremony Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lantern Ceremony===
[[File:Hiroshima Lantern Festival.jpeg|thumb|Drifting lanterns]]
In the evening of the same day, [[TÅrÅ nagashi|Lantern ceremony]] is held to send off the spirits of the victims on lanterns with peace messages floating on the waters of the Motoyasu River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.hiroshima.jp/www/contents/0000000000000/1216185402998/index.html Peace messages and Lantern Ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museums==
[[File:Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|The main building of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.]]

===Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum===
{{main|Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum}}
The [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] is the primary museum in the park dedicated to educating visitors about the bomb.
The Museum has exhibits and information covering the buildup to war, the role of Hiroshima in the war up to the bombing, and extensive information on the bombing and its effects, along with substantial memorabilia and pictures from the bombing.
The building also has views of the Memorial Cenotaph, Peace Flame, and A-Bomb Dome.

International Conference Center Hiroshima is in the Peace Park, west side of the main building of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.

[[File:Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims 2008 01.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Hall of Remembrance]]

===Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall===
{{main|Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims}}
The [[Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims]] is an effort by the Japanese national government to remember and mourn the sacred sacrifice of the atomic bomb victims. It is also an expression of Japan's desire for genuine and lasting peace. The Hall contains a number of displays. On the roof, near the entrance (the museum is underground) is a clock frozen at 8:15, the time the bomb went off. The museum contains a seminar room, library, temporary exhibition area, and victims' information area. The Hall of Remembrance, contains a 360 degree panorama of the destroyed Hiroshima recreated using 140,000 tiles â the number of people estimated to have died from the bomb by the end of 1945.

==Monuments==
[[File:Cenotaph Hiroshima.jpg|right|thumb|175px|The Memorial Cenotaph.]]

===Memorial Cenotaph===
Near the center of the park is a concrete, saddle-shaped monument that covers a [[cenotaph]] holding the names of all of the people killed by the bomb. The monument is aligned to frame the Peace Flame and the A-Bomb Dome.
The Memorial Cenotaph was one of the first memorial monuments built on open field on August 6, 1952. &lt;!--It is built in Shinto style.--&gt;
The arch shape represents a shelter for the souls of the victims.&lt;ref name="benedict" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch-hiroshima.net/arch-hiroshima/arch/delta_center/ireihi_e.html Cenotaph for the A-Bomb Victims]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cenotaph carries the [[epitaph]] {{nihongo2|å®ããã«ç ã£ã¦ä¸ãã éã¡ã¯ ç¹°è¿ãã¾ãã¬ãã}}, which means "please rest in peace, for [we/they] shall not repeat the error." In Japanese, the sentence's subject is [[Pro-drop language|omitted]], thus it could be interpreted as either "[we] shall not repeat the error" or as "[they] shall not repeat the error". This was intended to memorialize the victims of Hiroshima without politicizing the issue, taking advantage of the fact that [[Honorific speech in Japanese|polite Japanese speech]] typically demands lexical ambiguity in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;''The Japanese Mind: Understanding Contemporary Japanese Culture'', ed. by Roger J. Davies and Osamu Ikeno (Rutland, Vermont: Tuttle Publishing, 2002), 9â16.&lt;/ref&gt; The epitaph was written by Tadayoshi Saika, Professor of English Literature at Hiroshima University.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://koara.lib.keio.ac.jp/xoonips/modules/xoonips/download.php?file_id=64799 Give Peace A Chance]'', Yoshihisa Hagiwara. "East Asian Perspectives on Politics", The Center of Governance for Civil Society, Keio University, 2011/12/18&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided the English translation, "Let all the souls here rest in peace for we shall not repeat the evil." On November 3, 1983, an explanation plaque in English was added in order to convey Professor Saika's intent that "we" refers to "all humanity", not specifically the Japanese or Americans, and that the "error" is the "evil of war":

{{quote|The inscription on the front panel offers a prayer for the peaceful repose of the victims and a pledge on behalf of all humanity never to repeat the evil of war. It expresses the spirit of Hiroshima â enduring grief, transcending hatred, pursuing harmony and prosperity for all, and yearning for genuine, lasting world peace.}}

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the ambiguity of the phrase has the potential to offend; some right-wing circles in Japan have interpreted the words as an admission of guiltâimplicitly reading it as "we (the Japanese people) shall not repeat the error"âand they criticize the epitaph as a self-accusation by the Japanese empire. In July 2005, the cenotaph was vandalized by a Japanese man affiliated with the Japanese right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacewar.com/2005/050727025919.s5wqvihv.html Rightist destroys reference to Japan's 'mistake' at Hiroshima memorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peace Flame and Museum.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Peace Flame with the Peace Memorial Museum in the background.]]

===Peace Flame===
The Peace Flame is another monument to the victims of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, but it has an additional symbolic purpose.
The flame has burned continuously since it was lit in 1964, and will remain lit until all nuclear bombs on the planet are destroyed and the planet is free from the threat of nuclear annihilation.
&lt;ref name="virtual_museum" /&gt;

[[File:Hiroshima Peace Bell.jpg|right|thumb|175px|A schoolgirl rings the Peace Bell in the Hiroshima Peace Park.]]

===Peace Bells===
There are three Peace Bells in the Peace Park. The smaller one is used only for the Peace Memorial Ceremony. Except that day, it is displayed in the east building of [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]]. The more well-known Peace Bell stands near the Children's Peace Monument and consists of a large Japanese bell hanging inside a small open-sided structure. Visitors are encouraged to ring the bell for world peace and the loud and melodious tolling of this bell rings out regularly throughout the Peace Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.env.go.jp/air/life/oto/SK/P76.html Peace Bell in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103164158/http://www.env.go.jp/air/life/oto/SK/P76.html |date=2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peace Bell was built out in the open on September 20, 1964. The surface of the bell is a map of the world, and the "sweet spot" is an atomic symbol, designed by [[Masahiko Katori]] [1899â1988], cast by Oigo Bell Works, in [[Takaoka, Toyama]]. The inscriptions on the bell are in [[Greek language|Greek]] (Î³Î½á¿¶Î¸Î¹ ÏÎµÎ±ÏÏÏÎ½), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Sanskrit]]. It is translated as "Know yourself." The Greek embassy donated the bell to the Peace Park and picked out the most appropriate ancient Greek philosophical quote of [[Socrates]]. The Sanskrit text is a quotation from [[Longer_SukhÄvatÄ«vyÅ«ha_SÅ«tra#SukhÄvatÄ«vyÅ«ha_SÅ«tra_Quotation_on_the_Peace_Bell_at_Hiroshima|Longer SukhÄvatÄ«vyÅ«ha SÅ«tra]] which was attested by the Indian ambassador.  The Japanese text was provided by a university lecturer.

[[File:Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound.jpg|thumb|250px|Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound.]]

===Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound===
The Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound is a large, grass-covered knoll that contains the cremated ashes of 70,000 unidentified victims of the bomb.&lt;ref name="virtual_museum" /&gt;

===Cenotaph for Korean Victims===

Among the 400,000 people who were killed or exposed to lethal post-explosion radiation, at least 45,000 were [[Koreans|Korean]], but the number is uncertain, because the population has been neglected as the minority. Additionally, 300,000 survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki returned to Korea after liberation from [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7D6173DF93AA15757C0A96E948260 | work=The New York Times | title=Hapchon Journal; A Different Hiroshima Story: The Bitter Koreans | first=Clyde | last=Haberman | date=1988-04-29 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument, decorated with Korean national symbols, is intended to honour Korean victims and survivors of the atomic bomb and Japanese colonialism.&lt;ref name="yoneyama" /&gt; The monument's inscription reads ''"The Monument in Memory of the Korean Victims of the A[tomic]-Bomb. In memory of the souls of His Highness Prince [[Yi Wu]] and over 20000 other souls"'', while the side-inscription reads ''"Souls of the dead ride to heaven on the backs of turtles."''&lt;ref name="virtual_museum" /&gt;
&lt;!-- Both riversides are also included the area of the park, and most of monuments for the local schools and companies are still in the riverside.
Due to disagreements between the governments of Japan and Korea, the monument was built across the river from the Peace Park.
It was moved into the park in July 1999.
--&gt;
[[File:Peace Gates.jpg|right|thumb|175px|The Gates of Peace]]

===Gates of Peace===
Added in 2005, this monument contains ten gates covered with the word "peace" in 49 languages from around the world. The gates represent [[Inferno (Dante)#The nine circles of Hell|the nine circles of Hell]] plus one: "the living hell of Hiroshima caused by the atomic bombing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_e/tour_e/ireihi/tour_52_e.html Gates of Peace â Hiroshima Prefecture]&lt;/ref&gt; Each gate is 9 meters high and 2.6 meters wide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wallforpeace.com/portes.html The word peace in 49 languages on "The Gates of Peace"] â designed by [[Clara Halter]], designed by [[Jean-Michel Wilmotte]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HiroshimaMobilizedStudents6690.jpg|thumb|175px|Memorial Tower to the Mobilized Students]]

===Memorial Tower to the Mobilized Students===
The Association for the Mobilized Student Victims of Hiroshima Prefecture built this tower in May 1967 in order to console the souls of over 10,000 students, including those who were Atomic Bomb victims, who died in bombings during the Pacific War. In Hiroshima, there were 8,387 students who were mobilized; 6,907 of which were killed in the Atomic Bombing. The memorial is twelve meters tall, five stories, and is decorated with the Goddess of Peace as well as eight doves which are placed around the tower. To the sides of the tower are plaques which depict the work that the students did, such as factory work, female students sewing, or showing students working to increase food production. There is a plaque in front of the tower which has two buttons that narrate the background information in either Japanese or English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kosakai|first1=Yoshiteru|title=Hiroshima Peace Reader|publisher=Hiroshima Peace Culture Foundation|isbn=978-4938239077|pages=63â64|edition=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25016">[[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) is a constitutional parliamentary democracy with an estimated population of 6,187,591.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pp.html|title=The World Factbook|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Police brutality]], provincial power struggles, [[violence against women]], and [[government corruption]] all contribute to the low awareness of basic human rights in the country.

==History and legal framework==
===Constitutional and other domestic law===
The Constitution of Papua New Guinea entered into force on the 16 September 1975. It is one of the few unique constitutions around the world that contains almost all the rights and freedoms enshrined the [[United Nations Charter]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] 1948. The constitution contains many civil and political rights that are able to be enforced by the judiciary. These include right to freedom (Section 32); right to life (Section 35); freedom from inhuman treatment (Section 36); freedom of conscience, thought and religion (Section 45); freedom of expression (Section 46) and right to vote and stand for public office (Section 50). Economic, social and cultural rights are not included in the constitution and are instead provided for in the National Goals and Directive Principles. These remain as guidelines and are non-justiciable.

However, the Constitution does not include âgenderâ or âsexâ as a prohibited ground of discrimination, which is inconsistent with PNGâs obligations under the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Article 2.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa34/005/2010/en/ |accessdate=September 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International treaties===
PNG has ratified 6 of the core human rights treaties; the third highest number in the Pacific behind [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]. These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]), International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]), the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ([[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]]), the Convention on the Rights of the Child ([[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]]), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]]) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ([[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|CRPD]]), ratified in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacific.ohchr.org/docs/RatificationBook.pdf |format=PDF |title=RATIFICATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES: ADDED VALUE FOR THE PACIFIC REGION |website=Pacific.ohchr.org |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this the most recent [[Amnesty International]] submission prepared for the [[Universal Periodic Review]] (UPR) of PNG in May 2011 found that reporting by the government of PNG on its obligations under the international human rights treaties to which it is party has been very poor.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

PNG joined the [[United Nations]](UN) in 1975 and on the 11 May 2011 extended a standing invitation to all the thematic mechanisms of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] to visit the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/invitations.htm |accessdate=September 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903013020/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/invitations.htm |archivedate=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010  the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on Torture visited PNG and suggested that the country urgently Ratify the Convention Against Torture ([[Convention Against Torture|CAT]]) and its Optional Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10058&amp;LangID=E |title=UN Special Rapporteur on Torture presents preliminary findings on his Mission to Papua New Guinea |publisher=Ohchr.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this the rapporteur also suggested that PNG ratify the first Optional Protocol to the ICCPR which provides for the right of victims to lodge individual complaints to the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] and also the second Optional Protocol aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. PNG has not yet ratified these instruments.

===National Human Rights Commission===
In 1997, the government approved in principle the establishment of a human rights commission for PNG with the minimum standards set by the Paris Principles.&lt;ref name="lib.ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/session11/PG/A_HRC_WG.6_11_PNG_1_E.pdf |accessdate=September 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320122848/http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/session11/PG/A_HRC_WG.6_11_PNG_1_E.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment was reaffirmed in 2007 with the presentation of the 2007 Final Option Paper on the establishment of the PNG human rights commission;&lt;ref name="lib.ohchr.org"/&gt; and in 2008 a draft organic law on the establishment of a human rights commission was prepared.&lt;ref name="lib.ohchr.org"/&gt;  This draft Bill has yet to go through the parliamentary process and it is unclear whether the O'Neill Government remains committed to the establishment of this institution.

==Civil and political rights==
The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government peacefully which is exercised in practice through periodic elections. All citizens possess the right to vote and political parties are able to operate free from restriction and outside influence.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154398.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Papua New Guinea |publisher=State.gov |date=2011-04-08 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the most recent elections violence was common in the Highlands which compromised the possibility of free and fair voting.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

The right to freedom of speech and freedom of press as provided for in the Constitution are generally respected. There is no evidence of officially sanctioned government censorship, however newspaper owners have complained about intimidation tactics being used in an attempt to influence coverage.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

The right to freedom of assembly is also present in the constitution however is often limited in practice. Public demonstrations require 14 days notice as well as police approval which is rarely granted.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

==Women's rights==
{{Main|Women's rights in Papua New Guinea}}

Papua New Guinea is often labelled as potentially the worst place in the world for [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/05/papua-new-guinea-abuse-clinic|author=Davidson, Helen|date=5 July 2013|title=MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res opens Papua New Guinea clinic for abuse victims|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/19/papua-new-guinea-spiralling-violence|author=Davidson, Helen|date=19 July 2013|title=Papua New Guinea: a country suffering spiralling violence|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual violence===
{{Main|Sexual violence in Papua New Guinea}}
A study by [[Rachel Jewkes]] et al., in [[The Lancet]] in 2013, on behalf of the [[United Nations]] Multi-country Cross-sectional Study on Men and Violence research team, found that 41% of men on Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea, admit to raping a non-partner.&lt;ref name=Jewkes&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Jewkes|first=Rachel
|author2=Emma Fulu|author3=Tim Roselli|author4=Claudia Garcia-Moreno |title=Prevalence of and factors associated with non-partner rape perpetration: findings from the UN Multi-country Cross-sectional Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific|journal=[[The Lancet]]|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X%2813%2970069-X/fulltext|accessdate=16 September 2013|date=10 September 2013|doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(13)70069-X|volume=323
|ref=harv|pages=e208âe218|pmid=25104346
}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 14.1% of men have committed [[gang rape|multiple perpetrator rape]].&lt;ref name=Jewkes/&gt; Other research indicates that two thirds of women have experienced domestic violence and fifty percent of women have experienced forced sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/01/27/where-violence-against-women-rampant |title=Where Violence Against Women is Rampant &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape is a crime punishable by imprisonment however a prevalent culture of silence has resulted in few rapists being apprehended. Police officials have been directly implicated in the widespread sexual violence against women.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

Polygyny; the custom of paying a âbride priceâ to obtain a bride is a recurring problem, as is using women as compensation between tribes to settle disputes. The courts have ruled that such settlements have denied the women their constitutional rights.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt; In July 2010 the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women urged the government to "put in place without delay a comprehensive strategy, including legislation, to modify or eliminate customary practices and stereotypes that discriminate against women in conformity with articles 2, 2 (f) and 5 (a) of the Convention."&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; There are no employment or antidiscrimination laws.

===Witch-hunts===
{{Main|Modern_witch-hunts#Papua_New_Guinea|l1=Witch-hunts in Papua New Guinea}}
Women are 6 times more likely to be accused of sorcery than men&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; and hundreds of accused witches and sorcerers are killed annually. The accusers often hire diviners known as a "Glass man" or "Glass mary" to confirm the accusation. The accused are often the weak of society, such as widows, while those with sons to support them have a higher chance of not being accused. Relatives often reject giving refuge to the accused because they have been paid a bride price by the husband, which would have to be returned if the wife leaves the husband. While killing witches used to be done discreetly, it has grown into a public spectacle.&lt;ref name=economist0717&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21725040-law-criminalising-sorcery-was-only-repealed-2013-gruesome-fate-witches-papua-new|title=The gruesome fate of âwitchesâ in Papua New Guinea|publisher=economist.com |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, a group of men stripped a woman naked, bound her hands and feet, forced a cloth in her mouth and then burnt her to death on a dumpsite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionandjustice.org/woman-burnt-for-sorcery/ |title=Woman Burnt For âSorceryâ â Mission &amp; Justice |publisher=Missionandjustice.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 a committee was established under the Constitutional Review and Law Reform Commission, to review the laws relating to sorcery and other measures to curb the number of sorcery-related murders. In 2013, the government repealed a law that criminalized sorcery and the use of accusing someone of witchcraft as a defense in murder trials.&lt;ref name=economist0717/&gt;

==Childrens' rights==
According to UNICEF, nearly half of reported rape victims are under 15 years of age and 13% are under 7 years of age,&lt;ref name=UNICEF2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/papuang_45211.html|title=UNICEF strives to help Papua New Guinea break cycle of violence|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|accessdate=26 February 2014|date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a report by [[ChildFund]] Australia citing former Parliamentarian Dame [[Carol Kidu]] claimed 50% of those seeking medical help after rape are under 16, 25% are under 12 and 10% are under 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wiseman H |title=Stop Violence Against Women and Children in Papua New Guinea |url=https://www.childfund.org.au/sites/default/files/publications/Stop%20Violence%20Against%20Women%20and%20Children%20in%20PNG%202013.pdf |website=ChildFund |date=August 2013 |accessdate=18 May 2015 |page=5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827092248/https://www.childfund.org.au/sites/default/files/publications/Stop%20Violence%20Against%20Women%20and%20Children%20in%20PNG%202013.pdf# |archive-date=2015-08-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous rights==
With over 800 indigenous tribes and languages PNG is one of the most heterogeneous countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pp.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of indigenous rights in the country is poor and the divide in language, customs and tradition, has resulted in regular intertribal feuds. PNG has not ratified either the ILO Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries 1989 &lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111031202527/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169 |CITP] &lt;/ref&gt; (CITP) or the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

On May 27, 2010 the government of PNG passed the Environment (Amendment) Bill 2010 &lt;ref name="actnowpng.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actnowpng.org/sites/default/files/Amend%20Enivrn%20Act-1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Environment (Amendment) Bill 2010 |website=Actnowpng.org |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which amends sections of the Environment and Conservation Act 2000 and gives the Secretary of the Department of Conservation the power to approve activities by mining and petroleum companies without the agreement of the traditional landowners. Any approval issued by the director will be final and âmay not be challenged or reviewed in any court or tribunal, except at the instigation of an Authorization Instrumentâ.&lt;ref name="actnowpng.org"/&gt;

These amendments are in contravention of the right of indigenous people to own land under s 53 of the constitution and Articleâs 14, 15 and 16 of the CITP as well as traditional customary law which recognises indigenous customary title to land. They also violate article 15.2 of the CITP which asserts that where the state retains ownership of sub-surface resources they shall consult indigenous peoples before undertaking or permitting any programs for the exploitation of such resources in regards to their lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C16] {{dead link|date=February 2016}}9&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the right of indigenous peoples to own land is protected under the constitution, this only pertains to the first six feet below the surface of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Catalinotto |first=John |url=http://www.workers.org/2009/world/papua_new_guinea_0611/ |title=Papua New Guineaâs Indigenous people v. Barrick Gold |publisher=Workers.org |date=2009-06-06 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the government can lease mining rights to companies to mine below the lands surface. Mining corporation Barrick Gold has been leased mining rights to mine in Porgera in the Eastern Highlands. As a result, there have been forced eviction of people from their homes and serious misconduct by police in this area.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] found that there were no effective means for people of the public could complain against the police acting in violation of international law and standards.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

The '''Intel Management Engine''' ('''ME'''), also known as the Manageability Engine,&lt;ref name=intelamt /&gt;&lt;ref name=intel-amt-me&gt;{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2011/12/14/intelr-amt-and-the-intelr-me|title=IntelÂ® AMT and the IntelÂ® ME|publisher=Intel}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an autonomous subsystem that has been incorporated in virtually all of Intel's [[Central processing unit|processor]] [[chipset]]s since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions for the IntelÂ® Management Engine Verification Utility |url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005974/software/chipset-software.html |quote=Built into many IntelÂ® Chipsetâbased platforms is a small, low-power computer subsystem called the IntelÂ® Management Engine (IntelÂ® ME).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eff1&gt;{{cite web |last1=Portnoy |first1=Erica |last2=Eckersley |first2=Peter |date=May 8, 2017 |title=Intel's Management Engine is a security hazard, and users need a way to disable it |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=intelamt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/getting-started-with-intel-active-management-technology-amt|title=Getting Started with IntelÂ® Active Management Technology (AMT)|publisher=Intel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsystem primarily consists of proprietary firmware running on a separate microprocessor that performs tasks during boot-up, while the computer is running, and while it is asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions for the IntelÂ® Management Engine Verification Utility |url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005974/software/chipset-software.html |quote=The IntelÂ® ME performs various tasks while the system is in sleep, during the boot process, and when your system is running.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the chipset or SoC is connected to current (via battery or power supply), it continues to run even when the system is turned off.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.blackhat.com/eu-17/briefings/schedule/#how-to-hack-a-turned-off-computer-or-running-unsigned-code-in-intel-management-engine-8668&lt;/ref&gt; Intel claims the ME is required to provide full performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions for the IntelÂ® Management Engine Verification Utility |url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005974/software/chipset-software.html |quote=This subsystem must function correctly to get the most performance and capability from your PC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its exact workings&lt;ref&gt;https://www.howtogeek.com/334013/intel-management-engine-explained-the-tiny-computer-inside-your-cpu/&lt;/ref&gt; are largely undocumented&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it&lt;/ref&gt; and its code is [[Obfuscation (software)|obfuscated]] using confidential [[huffman coding|huffman tables]] stored directly in hardware, so the firmware does not contain the information necessary to decode its contents.&lt;ref&gt;http://io.netgarage.org/me/&lt;/ref&gt; Intel's main competitor AMD has incorporated the equivalent [[AMD Secure Technology]] (formally called Platform Security Processor) in virtually all of its post-2013 CPUs.&lt;ref&gt;https://libreboot.org/faq.html#amd&lt;/ref&gt;

The Management Engine is often confused with [[Intel Active Management Technology|Intel AMT]]. AMT runs on the ME, but is only available on processors with [[vPro]]. AMT enables owners remote administration of their computer,&lt;ref name="techrepublicME"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallen |first=Jack |date=July 1, 2016 |title=Is the Intel Management Engine a backdoor? |url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/is-the-intel-management-engine-a-backdoor/}}&lt;/ref&gt; like turning it on or off and reinstalling the operating system. However, the ME itself is built into all Intel chipsets since 2008, not only those with AMT. While AMT can be unprovisioned by the owner, there is no official, documented way to disable the ME.

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) and security expert Damien Zammit accuse the ME of being a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] and a privacy concern.&lt;ref name="softpediaME" /&gt;&lt;ref name=eff1 /&gt; Zammit states that the ME has full access to memory (without the parent CPU having any knowledge); has full access to the [[TCP/IP stack]] and can send and receive network packets independent of the operating system, thus bypassing its firewall.&lt;ref name="techrepublicME" /&gt; Intel asserts that it "does not put back doors in its products" and that its products do not "give Intel control or access to computing systems without the explicit permission of the end user."&lt;ref name="techrepublicME" /&gt;&lt;ref name="register_can_disable" /&gt;

Several weaknesses have been found in the ME. On May 1, 2017, Intel confirmed a Remote Elevation of Privilege bug (SA-00075) in its Management Technology.&lt;ref name="intelmay"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://security-center.intel.com/advisory.aspx?intelid=INTEL-SA-00075&amp;languageid=en-fr |title=IntelÂ® Product Security Center |website=Security-center.intel.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every Intel platform with provisioned Intel Standard Manageability, Active Management Technology, or Small Business Technology, from [[Intel Nehalem|Nehalem]] in 2008 to [[Intel Kaby Lake|Kaby Lake]] in 2017 has a remotely exploitable security hole in the ME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlie Demerjian |url=https://semiaccurate.com/2017/05/01/remote-security-exploit-2008-intel-platforms/ |title=Remote security exploit in all 2008+ Intel platforms |publisher=SemiAccurate |date=2017-05-01 |accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reg-2017-05-01"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/01/intel_amt_me_vulnerability/ |title=Red alert!

==Design==
===Hardware===
Starting with ME 11, it is based on the [[Intel Quark]] x86-based [[32-bit]] CPU and runs the [[MINIX 3]] operating system.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/08/disabling-intel-me.html |title=Positive Technologies Blog: Disabling Intel ME 11 via undocumented mode |accessdate=2017-08-30 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The ME state is stored in a partition of the [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI flash]], using the [[Embedded Flash File System]] (EFFS).&lt;ref name="is"/&gt; Previous versions were based on an [[ARC (processor)|ARC core]], with the Management Engine running the [[ThreadX]] [[RTOS]] from [[Express Logic]]. Versions 1.x to 5.x of the ME used the ARCTangent-A4 (32-bit only instructions) whereas versions 6.x to 8.x used the newer ARCompact (mixed 32- and [[16-bit]] [[instruction set architecture]]). Starting with ME 7.1, the ARC processor could also execute signed [[Java applets]].

The ME has its own MAC and IP address for the out-of-band interface, with direct access to the Ethernet controller; one portion of the Ethernet traffic is diverted to the ME even before reaching the host's operating system, for what support exists in various Ethernet controllers, exported and made configurable via [[Management Component Transport Protocol]] (MCTP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/i210-ethernet-controller-datasheet.pdf | title = Intel Ethernet Controller I210 Datasheet | format = PDF | year = 2013 | accessdate = 2013-11-09 | publisher = [[Intel]] | pages = 1, 15, 52, 621&amp;ndash;776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/ethernet-x540-brief.pdf | title = Intel Ethernet Controller X540 Product Brief | format = PDF | year = 2012 | accessdate = 2014-02-26 | publisher = [[Intel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ME also communicates with the host via PCI interface.&lt;ref name="is"&gt;Igor Skochinsky ([[Hex-Rays]]) [http://2012.ruxconbreakpoint.com/assets/Uploads/bpx/Breakpoint%202012%20Skochinsky.pdf Rootkit in your laptop], Ruxcon Breakpoint 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Under Linux, communication between the host and the ME is done via &lt;tt&gt;/dev/mei&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref name="meilnx"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/misc-devices/mei/mei.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101045709/https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/misc-devices/mei/mei.txt |archivedate=November 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the release of [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] processors, the ME was usually embedded into the motherboard's [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]], following the [[Memory Controller Hub]] (MCH) layout.&lt;ref name="quest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/misc09/Quest%20To%20The%20Core%20%28public%29.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Quest to the Core |author=Joanna Rutkowska |website=Invisiblethingslab.com |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the newer Intel architectures ([[Intel 5 Series]] onwards), ME is included into the [[Platform Controller Hub]] (PCH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/celeron-mobile-p4000-u3000-datasheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211075753/http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/celeron-mobile-p4000-u3000-datasheet.pdf |archivedate=February 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.nik.uni-obuda.hu/sima/letoltes/magyar/SZA2011_osz/nappali/Platforms-3_E_2011_12_14.ppt |format=PDF |title=Platforms II |website=Users.nik.uni-obuda.hu |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firmware===
By Intel's current terminology as of 2017, ME is one of several firmware sets for the Converged Security and Manageability Engine (CSME). Prior to AMT version 11, CSME was called Intel Management Engine BIOS Extension (Intel MEBx).&lt;ref name=intelamt /&gt;

==Security vulnerabilities==
===Disabling the ME===
It is normally not possible for the user to disable the ME. Potentially risky, undocumented methods to do so were discovered, however.&lt;ref name=extreme1 /&gt; These methods are not supported by Intel. The ME's security architecture is supposed to prevent disabling, and thus its possibility is considered a security vulnerability. For example, a virus could abuse it to make the computer lose some of the functionality that the typical end-user  expects, such as the ability to play media with [[Digital rights management|DRM]]. Yet, critics consider the weaknesses not as bugs, but as features.

Strictly speaking, none of the known methods disables the ME completely, since it is required for booting the main CPU. All known methods merely make the ME go into abnormal states soon after boot, in which it seems not to have any working functionality. The ME is still physically connected to the current and its microprocessor is continuing to execute code.

====Undocumented methods====

=====Firmware neutering=====
In 2016, the me_cleaner project found that the ME's integrity verification is broken. The ME is supposed to detect that it has been tampered with, and, if this is the case, shut down the PC forcibly after 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner&lt;/ref&gt; This prevents a compromised system from running undetected, yet allows the owner to fix the issue by flashing a valid version of the ME firmware during the grace period. As the project found out, by making unauthorized changes to the ME firmware, it was possible to force it into an abnormal error state that prevented triggering the shutdown even if large parts of the firmware had been overwritten and thus made inoperable.

====="High Assurance Platform" mode=====
In August 2017, Russian company Positive Technologies ([[Dmitry Sklyarov]]) published a method to disable the ME via an undocumented built-in mode. As Intel has confirmed&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/hardware/researchers-find-a-way-to-disable-much-hated-intel-me-component-courtesy-of-the-nsa/&lt;/ref&gt; the ME contains a switch to enable government authorities such as the [[NSA]] to make the ME go into High-Assurance Platform (HAP) mode after boot. This mode disables most of ME's functions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/29/intel_management_engine_can_be_disabled/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/08/disabling-intel-me.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is authorized for use by government authorities only and is supposed to be available only in machines produced for them. Yet it turned out that most machines sold on the retail market can be tricked into activating the switch.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/08/disabling-intel-me.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/wiki/HAP-AltMeDisable-bit&lt;/ref&gt;. Manipulation of the HAP bit was quickly incorporated into the me_cleaner project&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/commit/ced3b46ba2ccd74602b892f9594763ef34671652&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Commercial ME disablement====
In late 2017, several laptop vendors announced their intentions to ship laptops with the Intel ME disabled:

* [[Purism, SPC|Purism]] previously petitioned Intel to sell processors without the ME, or release its source code, calling it "a threat to users' digital rights"&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160616070449/https://puri.sm/posts/petition-for-intel-to-release-an-me-less-cpu-design/&lt;/ref&gt;. In March 2017, Purism announced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/neutralizing-intel-management-engine-on-librem-laptops/|title=Neutralizing the Intel Management Engine on Librem Laptops|last=Alaoui|first=Youness|date=2017-03-09|website=puri.sm|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it had neutralized the ME by erasing the majority of the ME code from the flash memory. It further announced in October 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://puri.sm/posts/purism-librem-laptops-completely-disable-intel-management-engine/&lt;/ref&gt; that new batches of their [[Debian]]-based Librem line of laptops will ship with the ME neutralized (via erasing the majority of ME code from the flash, as previously announced), and additionally disabling most ME operation via the HAP bit. Updates for existing Librem laptops were also announced. 

* [[System 76]] announced in November 2017&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.system76.com/post/168050597573/system76-me-firmware-updates-plan&lt;/ref&gt; their plan to disable the ME on their new and recent [[Ubuntu_(operating_system)|Ubuntu]]-based machines via the HAP bit.

* [[Dell]], in December 2017,&lt;ref&gt;https://liliputing.com/2017/12/dell-also-sells-laptops-intel-management-engine-disabled.html&lt;/ref&gt; began showing certain laptops on its website that offered the "Systems Management" option "Intel vPro - ME Inoperable, Custom Order" for an additional fee. Dell has not announced or publicly explained the methods used. In response to press requests, Dell stated that those systems had been offered for quite a while, but not for the general public, and had found their way to the website only inadvertently.&lt;ref name=extremedell&gt;https://www.extremetech.com/computing/260219-dell-sells-pcs-without-intel-management-engine-tradeoffs&lt;/ref&gt; The laptops are available only by custom order and only to military, government and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Dell-schaltet-Intel-Management-Engine-in-Spezial-Notebooks-ab-3909860.html&lt;/ref&gt; They are specifically designed for covert operations, such as providing a very robust case and a "stealth" operating mode kill switch that disables display, LED lights, speaker, fan and any wireless technology&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dell.com/support/manuals/us/en/04/latitude-14-5414-laptop/5414_om/stealth-mode?guid=guid-3655713b-6a1b-46a8-ba69-eaa3c324b3cd&amp;lang=en-us&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Effectiveness against vulnerabilities====
None of the two methods to disable the ME discovered so far turned out to be an effective countermeasure against the SA-00086 vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/06/intel_management_engine_pwned_by_buffer_overflow/&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the vulnerability is in an early-loaded ME module that is essential to boot the main CPU.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/rootkovska/status/938458875522666497&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Ring -3}}Ring â3 rootkit===
A [[protection ring|ring]]&amp;nbsp;â3 rootkit was demonstrated by Invisible Things Lab for the Q35 chipset; it does not work for the later Q45 chipset as Intel implemented additional protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://invisiblethingslab.com/press/itl-press-2009-03.pdf |format=PDF |title=Invisible Things Lab to present two new technical presentations disclosing system-level vulnerabilities affecting modern PC hardware at its core |website=Invisiblethingslab.com |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exploit worked by remapping the normally protected memory region (top 16&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM) reserved for the ME. The ME rootkit could be installed regardless of whether the AMT is present or enabled on the system, as the chipset always contains the ARC ME coprocessor. (The "â3" designation was chosen because the ME coprocessor works even when the system is in the [[Sleep mode|S3 state]], thus it was considered a layer below the [[System Management Mode]] rootkits.&lt;ref name="quest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/misc09/Quest%20To%20The%20Core%20%28public%29.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Quest to the Core |author=Joanna Rutkowska |website=Invisiblethingslab.com |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) For the vulnerable Q35 chipset, a [[keystroke logger]] ME-based rootkit was demonstrated by Patrick Stewin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stewin.org/slides/pstewin-SPRING6-EvaluatingRing-3Rootkits.pdf |format=PDF |title=Berlin Institute of Technology : FG Security in telecommunications : Evaluating "Ring-3" Rootkits |website=Stewin.org |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stewin.org/slides/44con_2013-dedicated_hw_malware-stewin_bystrov.pdf |format=PDF |title=Persistent, Stealthy Remote-controlled Dedicated Hardware Malware |website=Stewin.org |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zero-touch provisioning===
Another security evaluation by Vassilios Ververis showed serious weaknesses in the GM45 chipset implementation. In particular, it criticized AMT for transmitting unencrypted passwords in the SMB provisioning mode when the IDE redirection and Serial over LAN features are used. It also found that the "zero touch" provisioning mode (ZTC) is still enabled even when the AMT appears to be disabled in BIOS. For about 60 euros, Ververis purchased from [[Go Daddy]] a certificate that is accepted by the ME firmware and allows remote "zero touch" provisioning of (possibly unsuspecting) machines, which broadcast their HELLO packets to would-be configuration servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.it.kth.se/~maguire/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/100402-Vassilios_Ververis-with-cover.pdf |format=PDF |title=Security Evaluation of Intel's Active Management Technology |website=Web.it.kth.se |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the [[PLATINUM (cybercrime group)|PLATINUM]] cybercrime group became notable for exploiting the [[Serial over LAN|serial over LAN (SOL)]] capabilities of AMT to perform data exfiltration of stolen documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/06/sneaky-hackers-use-intel-management-tools-to-bypass-windows-firewall/|title=Sneaky hackers use Intel management tools to bypass Windows firewall|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-firewall-dodged-by-hot-patching-spies-using-intel-amt-says-microsoft/|title=Windows firewall dodged by 'hot-patching' spies using Intel AMT, says Microsoft - ZDNet|first=Liam|last=Tung|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/07/platinum-continues-to-evolve-find-ways-to-maintain-invisibility/|title=PLATINUM continues to evolve, find ways to maintain invisibility|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malware-uses-obscure-intel-cpu-feature-to-steal-data-and-avoid-firewalls/|title=Malware Uses Obscure Intel CPU Feature to Steal Data and Avoid Firewalls|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itnews.com.au/news/hackers-abuse-low-level-management-feature-for-invisible-backdoor-464499|title=Hackers abuse low-level management feature for invisible backdoor|website=iTnews|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/AMP/2017/06/08/vxers_exploit_intels_amt_for_malwareoverlan/|title=Vxers exploit Intel's Active Management for malware-over-LAN â¢ The Register|website=www.theregister.co.uk|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/security/meldung/Intel-Fernwartung-AMT-bei-Angriffen-auf-PCs-genutzt-3739441.html|title=Intel-Fernwartung AMT bei Angriffen auf PCs genutzt|first=heise|last=Security|website=Security|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Windows-Security-Blog/PLATINUM-activity-group-file-transfer-method-using-Intel-AMT-SOL|title=PLATINUM activity group file-transfer method using Intel AMT SOL|website=Channel 9|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SA-00086===
Some months after the previous bugs, and subsequent warnings from the EFF,&lt;ref name=eff1 /&gt; security firm Positive Technologies claimed to have developed a working [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blackhat.com/eu-17/briefings/schedule/#how-to-hack-a-turned-off-computer-or-running-unsigned-code-in-intel-management-engine-8668 How to Hack a Turned-Off Computer, or Running Unsigned Code in Intel Management Engine Black Hat Europe 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November, 2017 Intel confirmed that a number of serious flaws had been found in the Management Engine (mainstream), Trusted Execution Engine (tablet/mobile), and Server Platform Services (high end server) firmware, and released a "critical firmware update".&lt;ref name=intel2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000025619/software.html|title=IntelÂ® Management Engine Critical Firmware Update (Intel SA-00086)|publisher=Intel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/intel-management-engine-vulnerabilities-pcs-servers-iot/|title=Intel Chip Flaws Leave Millions of Devices Exposed|publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially every Intel-based computer for the last several years, including most desktops and servers, were found to be vulnerable to having their security compromised, although all the potential routes of exploitation were not entirely known.&lt;ref name=wired1 /&gt; It is not possible to patch the problems from the operating system, and a firmware (UEFI, BIOS) update to the motherboard is required, which was anticipated to take quite some time for the many individual manufacturers to accomplish, if it ever would be for many systems.&lt;ref name=extreme1 /&gt;

====Affected systems&lt;ref name=intel2 /&gt;====
* [[Intel Atom]] â C3000 family
* Intel Atom â Apollo Lake E3900 series
* [[Intel Celeron]] â N and J series
* [[Intel Core]] (i3, i5, i7, i9) â 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th generation
* [[Intel Pentium]] â Apollo Lake
* [[Intel Xeon]] â E3-1200 v5 and v6 product family
* Intel Xeon â Scalable family
* Intel Xeon â W family

====Mitigation====
None of the known unofficial methods to disable the ME prevent exploitation of the vulnerability. A firmware update by the vendor is required. However, those who discovered the vulnerability note that firmware updates are not fully effective either, as an attacker with access to the ME firmware region can simply flash an old, vulnerable version and then exploit the bug.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/06/intel_management_engine_pwned_by_buffer_overflow/&lt;/ref&gt;

===SA-00112===
In July 2018 Intel announced that 3 vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-3628, CVE-2018-3629 and CVE-2018-3632) had been discovered and that a patch for the CSME firmware would be required. Intel indicated there would be no patch for 3rd generation Core processors or earlier despite chips or their chipsets as far back as Intel Core 2 Duo vPro and Intel Centrino 2 vPro being affected.&lt;ref name=SA-00112/&gt;

==Claims that ME is a backdoor==
Critics like the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) and security expert Damien Zammit accused the ME of being a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] and a privacy concern.&lt;ref name="softpediaME"&gt;{{cite web |title=Intel x86 CPUs Come with a Secret Backdoor That Nobody Can Touch or Disable |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/intel-x86-cpus-come-with-a-secret-backdoor-that-nobody-can-touch-or-disable-505347.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eff1 /&gt; Zammit stresses that the ME has full access to memory (without the parent CPU having any knowledge); has full access to the TCP/IP stack and can send and receive network packets independently of the operating system, thus bypassing its firewall.&lt;ref name="techrepublicME" /&gt;

Intel responded by saying that "Intel does not put back doors in its products nor do our products give Intel control or access to computing systems without the explicit permission of the end user."&lt;ref name="techrepublicME" /&gt; and "Intel does not and will not design backdoors for access into its products. Recent reports claiming otherwise are misinformed and blatantly false. Intel does not participate in any efforts to decrease security of its technology."&lt;ref name="register_can_disable"&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/29/intel_management_engine_can_be_disabled/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of criticism of the Intel ME and AMD Secure Technology it has been pointed out that the NSA budget request for 2013 contained a Sigint Enabling Project with the goal to "Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, â¦" and it has been conjectured that Intel ME and AMD Secure Technology might be part of that programme.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heise.de/ct/ausgabe/2018-7-Briefe-E-Mail-Hotline-3992838.html#p_41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
{{asof|2017}}, Google was attempting to eliminate [[proprietary software|proprietary]] firmware from its servers and found that the ME was a hurdle to that.&lt;ref name=extreme1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.extremetech.com/computing/259426-intel-patches-major-flaws-intel-management-engine|title=Intel Patches Major Flaws in the Intel Management Engine|publisher=Extreme Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Reaction by AMD processor vendors===
Shortly after SA-00086 was patched, vendors for AMD processor mainboards started shipping BIOS updates that allow disabling the [[AMD Platform Security Processor|AMD Secure Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/AMD-Secure-Processor-PSP-wohl-bei-einigen-Ryzen-Mainboards-abschaltbar-3913635.html&lt;/ref&gt; a subsystem with similar function as the ME.

'''Key management''' refers to management  of [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] in a [[cryptosystem]]. This includes dealing with the generation, exchange, storage, use, [[crypto-shredding]] (destruction) and replacement of keys. It includes [[cryptographic protocol]] design, [[Key server (cryptographic)|key server]]s, user procedures, and other relevant protocols.&lt;ref name="Turner-What-is-key-management"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=What Is Key Management? A CISO Perspective|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/what-is-key-management-a-ciso-perspective|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key management concerns keys at the user level, either between users or systems. This is in contrast to [[key scheduling]], which typically refers to the internal handling of keys within the operation of a cipher.

Successful key management is critical to the security of a cryptosystem. It is the more challenging side of [[cryptography]] in a sense that it involves aspects of social engineering such as system policy, user training, organizational and departmental interactions, and coordination between all of these elements, in contrast to pure mathematical practices that can be automated.

==Types of keys==
{{main|Cryptographic key types}}
Cryptographic systems may use different types of keys, with some systems using more than one. These may include symmetric keys or asymmetric keys. In a [[symmetric key algorithm]] the keys involved are identical for both encrypting and decrypting a message. Keys must be chosen carefully, and distributed and stored securely. Asymmetric keys, also known as [[Public-key cryptography|public keys]], in contrast are two distinct keys that are mathematically linked. They are typically used together to communicate. Public key infrastructure (PKI), the implementation of public key cryptography,  requires an organization to establish an infrastructure to create and manage public and private key pairs along with digital certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyle|first1=Randall|last2=Panko|first2=Ray|title=Corporate Computer Security|date=2015|publisher=Pearson|location=Upper Saddle River New Jersey|page=278|edition=Fourth|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventory==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
The starting point in any certificate and private key management strategy is to create a comprehensive inventory of all certificates, their locations and responsible parties. This is not a trivial matter because certificates from a variety of sources are deployed in a variety of locations by different individuals and teams - it's simply not possible to rely on a list from a single [[certificate authority]]. Certificates that are not renewed and replaced before they expire can cause serious downtime and outages. Some other considerations:
*Regulations and requirements, like PCI-DSS, demand stringent security and management of cryptographic keys and auditors are increasingly reviewing the management controls and processes in use.
*Private keys used with certificates must be kept secure or unauthorised individuals can intercept confidential communications or gain unauthorised access to critical systems. Failure to ensure proper segregation of duties means that admins who generate the encryption keys can use them to access sensitive, regulated data.
*If a certificate authority is compromised or an encryption algorithm is broken, organizations must be prepared to replace all of their certificates and keys in a matter of hours.

==Management steps==
Once keys are inventoried, key management typically consists of three steps: exchange, storage and use.

===Key exchange===
{{Main|Key exchange}}
Prior to any secured communication, users must set up the details of the cryptography. In some instances this may require exchanging identical keys (in the case of a symmetric key system). In others it may require possessing the other party's public key. While public keys can be openly exchanged (their corresponding private key is kept secret), symmetric keys must be exchanged over a secure communication channel. Formerly, exchange of such a key was extremely troublesome, and was greatly eased by access to secure channels such as a [[diplomatic bag]]. [[Clear text]] exchange of symmetric keys would enable any interceptor to immediately learn the key, and any encrypted data.

The advance of public key cryptography in the 1970s has made the exchange of keys less troublesome. Since the [[Diffie-Hellman]] key exchange protocol was published in 1975, it has become possible to exchange a key over an insecure communications channel, which has substantially reduced the risk of key disclosure during distribution. It is possible, using something akin to a [[book code]], to include key indicators as clear text attached to an encrypted message. The encryption technique used by [[Richard Sorge]]'s code clerk was of this type, referring to a page in a statistical manual, though it was in fact a code. The [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] symmetric encryption key was a mixed type early in its use; the key was a combination of secretly distributed key schedules and a user chosen session key component for each message.

In more modern systems, such as [[OpenPGP]] compatible systems, a session key for a symmetric key algorithm is distributed encrypted by an [[asymmetric key algorithm]]. This approach avoids even the necessity for using a key exchange protocol like Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Another method of key exchange involves encapsulating one key within another. Typically a master key is generated and exchanged using some secure method. This method is usually cumbersome or expensive (breaking a master key into multiple parts and sending each with a trusted courier for example) and not suitable for use on a larger scale. Once the master key has been securely exchanged, it can then be used to securely exchange subsequent keys with ease. This technique is usually termed [[key wrap]]. A common technique uses [[block cipher]]s and cryptographic [[hash function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pressestelle Ruhr-UniversitÃ¤t Bochum - Online-Redaktion |url=http://www.crypto.rub.de/its_seminar_ws0809.html |title=Startseite - Ruhr-UniversitÃ¤t Bochum |language=de |publisher=Crypto.rub.de |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related method is to exchange a master key (sometimes termed a root key) and derive subsidiary keys as needed from that key and some other data (often referred to as diversification data). The most common use for this method is probably in [[smartcard]]-based cryptosystems, such as those found in banking cards. The bank or credit network embeds their secret key into the card's secure key storage during card production at a secured production facility. Then at the [[point of sale]] the card and card reader are both able to derive a common set of session keys based on the shared secret key and card-specific data (such as the card serial number). This method can also be used when keys must be related to each other (i.e., departmental keys are tied to divisional keys, and individual keys tied to departmental keys). However, tying keys to each other in this way increases the damage which may result from a security breach as attackers will learn something about more than one key. This reduces entropy, with regard to an attacker, for each key involved.

===Key storage===
However distributed, keys must be stored securely to maintain communications security. Security is a big concern&lt;ref name="Crain's New York"&gt;{{cite web|title=An ancient technology gets a key makeover|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20131120/TECHNOLOGY/131129993/an-ancient-technology-gets-a-key-makeover|website=Crain's New York Business|publisher=Crain's New York|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence there are various techniques in use to do so. Likely the most common is that an encryption application manages keys for the user and depends on an access password to control use of the key. Likewise, in the case of smartphone keyless access platforms, they keep all identifying door information off mobile phones and servers and encrypt all data, where just like low-tech keys, users give codes only to those they trust.&lt;ref name="Crain's New York"/&gt;

===Key use===
The major issue is length of time a key is to be used, and therefore frequency of replacement. Because it increases any attacker's required effort, keys should be frequently changed. This also limits loss of information, as the number of stored encrypted messages which will become readable when a key is found will decrease as the frequency of key change increases. Historically, symmetric keys have been used for long periods in situations in which key exchange was very difficult or only possible intermittently. Ideally, the symmetric key should change with each message or interaction, so that only that message will become readable if the key is learned (''e.g.'', stolen, cryptanalyzed, or social engineered).

==Challenges==
Several challenges IT organizations face when trying to control and manage their encryption keys are:
# Scalability: Managing a large number of encryption keys.
# Security: Vulnerability of keys from outside hackers, malicious insiders.
# Availability: Ensuring data accessibility for authorized users.
# Heterogeneity: Supporting multiple databases, applications and standards.
# Governance: Defining policy-driven access control and protection for data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/Tina-stewart/security-policy-and-enterprise-key-management-from-vormetric |title=Security Policy and Key Management: Centrally Manage Encryption Key |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-08-13 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governance includes compliance with [[Information privacy|data protection]] requirements.

==Compliance==
Key management compliance refers to the oversight, assurance and capability of being able to demonstrate that keys are securely managed. This includes the following individual compliance domains:

* ''Physical security'' â the most visible form of compliance, which may include locked doors to secure system equipment and surveillance cameras. These safeguards can prevent unauthorized access to printed copies of key material and computer systems that run key management software.
* ''Logical security'' â protects the organization against the theft or unauthorized access of information. This is where the use of cryptographic keys comes in by encrypting data, which is then rendered useless to those who do not have the key to decrypt it.
* ''Personnel security'' â this involves assigning specific roles or privileges to personnel to access information on a strict need-to-know basis. Background checks should be performed on new employees along with periodic role changes to ensure security.&lt;ref name="Turner-What-is-key-management" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinholm-KeyManagementCompliance"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reinholm|first1=James H.|title=Simplifying the Complex Process of Auditing a Key Management System for Compliance|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/simplifying-the-complex-process-of-auditing-a-key-management-system-for-compliance|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regulatory compliance|Compliance]] can be achieved with respect to national and international [[data protection]] standards and regulations, such as [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]], [[SarbanesâOxley Act]], or [[General Data Protection Regulation]].&lt;ref name="Stubbs-Buyer's guide"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stubbs|first1=Rob|title=Buyerâs Guide to Choosing a Crypto Key Management System|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/buyers-guide-to-choosing-a-crypto-key-management-system|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management and compliance systems==

===Key management system===
A ''key management system'' (KMS), also known as a ''cryptographic key management system'' (CKMS), is an integrated approach for generating, distributing and managing [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] for devices and applications. They may cover all aspects of security - from the secure generation of keys over the secure exchange of keys up to secure key handling and storage on the client. Thus, a KMS includes the backend functionality for [[key generation]], distribution, and replacement as well as the client functionality for injecting keys, storing and managing keys on devices.

===Standards-based key management===

Many specific applications have developed their own key management systems with home grown protocols.  However, as systems become more interconnected keys need to be shared between those different systems.  To facilitate this, key management standards have evolved to define the protocols used to manage and exchange cryptographic keys and related information.

===Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)===
{{Main|Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)}}

KMIP is an extensible key management protocol that has been developed by many organizations working within the [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS standards body]].  The first version was released in 2010, and it has been further developed by an active technical committee.

The protocol allows for the creation of keys and their distribution among disparate software systems that need to utilize them.  It covers the full key life cycle of both symmetric and asymmetric keys in a variety of formats, the wrapping of keys, provisioning schemes, and cryptographic operations as well as meta data associated with the keys.

The protocol is backed by an extensive series of test cases, and interoperability testing is performed between compliant systems each year.

====KMS security policy====
The security policy of a key management system provides the rules that are to be used to protect keys and metadata that the key management system supports. As defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology [[NIST]], the policy shall establish and specify rules for this information that will protect its:&lt;ref name="Reinholm-KeyManagementCompliance" /&gt;
* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availability
* Authentication of source&lt;ref name="NIST-KeyManagementSystems"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barker|first1=Elaine|last2=Smid|first2=Miles|last3=Branstad|first3=Dennis|last4=Chokhani|first4=Santosh|title=NIST Special Publication 800 -130:  A Framework for Designing  Cryptographic Key Management  Systems|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-130.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This protection covers the complete key life-cycle from the time the key becomes operational to its elimination.&lt;ref name="Turner-What-is-key-management" /&gt;

====Bring your own encryption / key====
{{main|Bring your own encryption}}
''Bring your own encryption'' (BYOE)âalso called ''bring your own key'' (BYOK)ârefers to a cloud-computing security model to allow public-cloud customers to use their own encryption software and manage their own encryption keys.
This security model is usually considered a marketing stunt, as critical keys are being handed over to third parties (cloud providers) and key owners are still left with the operational burden of generating, rotating and sharing their keys.

===Public-key infrastructure (PKI)===
{{main|Public key infrastructure}}
A public-key infrastructure is a type of key management system that uses hierarchical [[digital certificates]] to provide authentication, and public keys to provide encryption. PKIs are used in World Wide Web traffic, commonly in the form of [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]].

===Multicast group key management===
Group key management means managing the keys in a group communication. Most of the group communications use [[multicast]] communication so that if the message is sent once by the sender, it will be received by all the users. The main problem in multicast group communication is its security. In order to improve the security, various keys are given to the users. Using the keys, the users can encrypt their messages and send them secretly. IETF.org released RFC 4046, entitled Multicast Security (MSEC) Group Key Management Architecture, which discusses the challenges of group key management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4046 |title=Multicast Security (MSEC) Group Key Management Architecture |website=ietf.org |date=2005-04-01 |accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Los Angeles Consular Corps''' is an informal organization representing 105 consulates located in [[Los Angeles, California]].

Los Angeles has the second largest [[Consular corps|consular community]] in the world, after [[New York City]].

New York City is home to the [[United Nations]], which means that every country has a formal presence in New York.  Therefore, Los Angeles is particularly unique because it is neither a national capital (or even a state capital), nor headquarters for a major international organization such as the UN, nor a major financial center (such as Sydney, Shanghai, and Frankfurt) and still has attracted over one hundred foreign consulates.  It is clear that among "normal" cities, Los Angeles has the largest consular community in the world.

Generally, the consulates in Los Angeles have jurisdiction over the regions of [[Southern California]], while some serve the entire state of [[California]], and other parts of the [[Western United States]].

==Los Angeles as a globally strategic location==
Los Angeles offers an important and strategic location: being inside the [[United States]], in the major state of California, and at the crossroads of both [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]].  Its location on the Pacific Rim makes it an obvious choice for most countries to locate its consulate.  Also, Los Angeles boasts one of the busiest major airports in the world: [[LAX]], also the [[Port of Los Angeles]] is the largest maritime port in the United States, and North America, and is the 4th largest in the world.  Los Angeles is the largest city in California, and the second largest in the U.S., and is the world's capital for entertainment.  Many factors make Los Angeles an important place on the global stage. The Los Angeles customs district is the largest in the U.S. in terms of international trade capital and volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mac.com/jonathanbeutler/ |accessdate=April 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520093834/http://web.mac.com/jonathanbeutler/ |archivedate=May 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2016}}

In demographic terms, Los Angeles is arguably the most ethnically diverse region in the world.  With nearly 300 languages spoken, and the largest communities of Koreans, Armenians, Persians, Filipinos, Taiwanese, Guatemalans, Mexicans, and Canadians outside their respective countries of origin, L.A. is a cosmopolitan and international melting pot.

==Leadership==
As of December 2017, leadership of the Los Angeles Consular Corps is as follows:
* Dean: Consul General [[Nasimi Aghayev]] of Azerbaijan
* First Vice Dean: Consul General Abdulla Alsaboosi of United Arab Emirates
* Second Vice Dean: Honorary Consul [[Grant Arthur Gochin]] of Togo
* Treasurer: Honorary Consul Dr. [[Juris Bunkis]] of Latvia
* Secretary: Honorary Consul Jaak Treiman of Estonia

==Location of consulates==
The majority of the said consulates in Los Angeles are located in the Wilshire area, West L.A., and Beverly Hills.

==Government relationships==
The government offices responsible for dealing with the foreign consulates in Los Angeles are:
*the [[Los Angeles County]] Office of Protocol
*the City of Los Angeles Office of Protocol, in Mayor [[Eric Garcetti]]'s office.
*International Trade Office, Office of the Mayor of Los Angeles
*the International Protocol Office of Governor Brown
*The U.S. Department of State office in Los Angeles (11000 Wilshire Blvd.)

== Members of the Los Angeles Consular Corps include consulates from the following countries ==
*[[Azerbaijan]]
*[[Brazil]]
*[[Canada]]
*[[China]]
*[[Mexico]]
*[[Spain]]
*[[Togo]]

Additionally, the Los Angeles Consular Corps includes foreign trade missions, foreign commercial offices:
*The Trade Office of Taiwan in Los Angeles [http://www.taiwanembassy.org/uslax/]
*The Brazilian Chamber of Commerce of California
*The Trade Council of Spain
*The Danish Business Council
*QuÃ©bec Government Offices - Los Angeles and Silicon Valley [http://www.international.gouv.qc.ca/en/los-angeles]

The '''Malaysian Solidarity Consolidation Committee''' was an organisation formed by political leaders from [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] and northern [[Borneo]], who favoured the creation of [[Malaysia]]. The Committee held its first meeting on 25 August 1961, in [[Jesselton]], [[Sabah]].&lt;ref&gt;''Why Indonesia Opposes British-Made "Malaysia."''. Djakarta: Govt. of the Republic of Indonesia, 1964. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ä»ç»æ¿ äºãæµ·éå¼æ.JPG|thumb|right|The map of Maritime Silk Road]]

'''Maritime Silk Road''' or '''Maritime Silk Route''' refer to the [[Maritime history|maritime]] section of historic [[Silk Road]] that connects [[China]] to [[Southeast Asia]], [[Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]], [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Arabian peninsula]], [[Somalia]] and all the way to [[Egypt]] and finally [[Europe]], that flourished between 2nd-century BCE and 15th-century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Maritime Silk Road | work = SEAArch| url = https://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/tag/maritime-silk-route/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The trade route encompassed numbers of seas and ocean; including [[South China Sea]], [[Strait of Malacca]], [[Indian Ocean]], [[Gulf of Bengal]], [[Arabian Sea]], [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Red Sea]]. The maritime route overlaps with historic Southeast Asian maritime trade, [[Spice trade]], [[Indian Ocean trade]] and after 8th centuryâthe Arabian naval trade network. The network also extend eastward to [[East China Sea]] and [[Yellow Sea]] to connect China with [[Korean Peninsula]] and [[Japanese archipelago]].

On May 2017, experts from various fields have held a meeting in London to discuss the proposal to nominate "Maritime Silk Route" as a new [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = UNESCO Expert Meeting for the World Heritage Nomination Process of the Maritime Silk Routes | work = [[UNESCO]] | url =http://whc.unesco.org/en/events/1378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micro hydro''' is a type of [[hydroelectric power]] that typically produces from 5&amp;nbsp;kW to 100&amp;nbsp;kW of [[electricity]] using the natural flow of water. Installations below 5&amp;nbsp;kW are called [[pico hydro]].&lt;ref name="irena"&gt;{{cite report|date=June 2012|title=RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES: COST ANALYSIS SERIES|url=https://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/RE_Technologies_Cost_Analysis-HYDROPOWER.pdf|publisher=[[ International Renewable Energy Agency]] |page=11|access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community, or are sometimes connected to electric power networks, particularly where [[net metering]] is offered.
There are many of these installations around the world, particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without the purchase of fuel.&lt;ref name="tve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English|title=Micro Hydro in the fight against poverty|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=November 2004|website=tve.org|publisher=TVE/ITDG |access-date=14 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730205707/http://www.tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;amp;lang=English|archive-date=30 July 2007|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Micro hydro systems complement [[solar PV power system]]s because in many areas, water flow, and thus available hydro power, is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum. Micro hydro is frequently accomplished with a [[pelton wheel]] for high head, low flow water supply. The installation is often just a small [[dam]]med pool, at the top of a waterfall, with several hundred feet of pipe leading to a small generator housing. In low head sites, generally water wheels and Archimedes screws are used. 

==Construction==
[[File:Microhydro System.svg|thumb|right|Typical microhydro setup.]]

Construction details of a microhydro plant are site-specific. Sometimes an existing mill-pond or other artificial reservoir is available and can be adapted for power production. In general, microhydro systems are made up of a number of components.&lt;ref name="Energy Savers: Components"&gt;{{cite web|title=How a Microhydro System Works|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/electricity/index.cfm/mytopic=11060|publisher=U.S. DOE|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important include the intake where water is diverted from the natural stream, river, or perhaps a waterfall. An intake structure such as a catch box is required to screen out floating debris and fish, using a screen or array of bars to keep out large objects. In temperate climates, this structure must resist ice as well. The intake may have a gate to allow the system to be dewatered for inspection and maintenance.

The intake is then brought through a canal and then forebay. The forebay is used for sediment holding. At the bottom of the system the water is tunneled through a pipeline ([[penstock]]) to the powerhouse building containing a [[water turbine|turbine]]. The penstock builds up pressure from the water that has traveled downwards.In mountainous areas, access to the route of the penstock may provide considerable challenges. If the water source and turbine are far apart, the construction of the penstock may be the largest part of the costs of construction. At the turbine, a controlling valve is installed to regulate the flow and the speed of the turbine. The turbine converts the flow and pressure of the water to mechanical energy; the water emerging from the turbine returns to the natural watercourse along a tailrace channel. The turbine turns a [[electrical generator|generator]], which is then connected to [[electrical load]]s; this might be directly connected to the power system of a single building in very small installations, or may be connected to a community distribution system for several homes or buildings.&lt;ref name="Energy Savers: Components"/&gt;

Usually, microhydro installations do not have a dam and reservoir, like large [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plants]] have, relying on a minimal flow of water to be available year-round.

==Head and flow characteristics==
Microhydro systems are typically set up in areas capable of producing up to 100 [[Watt|kilowatts]] of electricity.&lt;ref name="Energy Savers: Main"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microhydropower Systems|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/electricity/index.cfm/mytopic=11050|publisher=U.S. DOE|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be enough to power a home or small business facility. This production range is calculated in terms of "head" and "flow". The higher each of these are, the more power available. [[Hydraulic head]] is the pressure measurement of water falling in a pipe expressed as a function of the vertical distance the water falls.&lt;ref name = "Energy Savers: Main"/&gt; This change in elevation is usually measured in feet or meters. A drop of at least 2 feet is required or the system may not be feasible.&lt;ref name="Oregon.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Micro Hydroelectric Systems|url=http://www.oregon.gov/ENERGY/RENEW/Hydro/Hydro_index.shtml|publisher=Oregon DOE|accessdate=1 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129052257/http://www.oregon.gov/ENERGY/RENEW/Hydro/Hydro_index.shtml|archivedate=29 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When quantifying head, both gross and net head must be considered.&lt;ref name = "Oregon.gov"/&gt; Gross head approximates power accessibility through the vertical distance measurement alone whereas net head subtracts pressure lost due to friction in piping from the gross head.&lt;ref name = "Oregon.gov"/&gt; "Flow" is the actual quantity of water falling from a site and is usually measured in gallons per minute, cubic feet per second, or liters per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Determining a Potential Microhydropower Site's Flow|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/electricity/index.cfm/mytopic=11090|publisher=U.S. DOE|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low flow/high head installations in steep terrain have significant pipe costs. A long penstock starts with low pressure pipe at the top and progressively higher pressure pipe closer to the turbine in order to reduce pipe costs.

The available power, in kilowatts, from such a system can be calculated by the equation P=Q*H/k, where Q is the flow rate in gallons per minute, H is the static head, and k is a constant of 5,310 gal*ft/min*kW.&lt;ref name="motherearthnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/renewable-energy/preparing-hydroelectric-power-zmaz86jfzglo|title=Preparing Your Land for Hydroelectric Power - Renewable Energy|publisher=[[Mother Earth News]]|date=February 1986|website=motherearthnews.com|access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, for a system with a flow of 500 gallons per minute and a static head of 60 feet, the theoretical maximum power output is 5.65&amp;nbsp;kW. The system is prevented from 100% efficiency (from obtaining all 5.65&amp;nbsp;kW) due to the real world, such as: turbine efficiency, friction in pipe, and conversion from potential to kinetic energy. Turbine efficiency is generally between 50-80%, and pipe friction is accounted for using the [[HazenâWilliams equation]].&lt;ref name="rpitt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rpitt.eng.ua.edu/Class/Water%20Resources%20Engineering/M3e%20Comparison%20of%20methods.pdf|title=Module 3e: Comparison of Pipe Flow Equations and Head Losses in Fittings|first=Robert|last=Pitt|first2=Shirley|last2=Clark|date=n.d.|website=eng.ua.edu|publisher=University of Alabama College of Engineering|access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation and operation==
Typically, an automatic controller operates the turbine inlet valve to maintain constant speed (and frequency) when the load changes on the generator. In a system connected to a grid with multiple sources, the turbine control ensures that power always flows out from the generator to the system. The frequency of the [[alternating current]] generated needs to match the local standard [[utility frequency]]. In some systems, if the useful load on the generator is not high enough, a [[load bank]] may be automatically connected to the generator to dissipate energy not required by the load; while this wastes energy, it may be required if it's not possible to control the water flow through the turbine.

An [[induction generator]] always operates at the grid frequency irrespective of its rotation speed; all that is necessary is to ensure that it is driven by the turbine faster than the synchronous speed so that it generates power rather than consuming it. Other types of generator can use a speed control systems for frequency matching.

With the availability of modern power electronics it is often easier to operate the generator at an arbitrary frequency and feed its output through an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] which produces output at grid frequency. Power electronics now allow the use of permanent magnet alternators that produce wild AC to be stabilised. This approach allows low speed / low head water turbines to be competitive; they can run at the best speed for extraction of energy, and the power frequency is controlled by the electronics instead of the generator.

Very small installations ([[pico hydro]]), a few kilowatts or smaller, may generate direct current and charge batteries for peak use times.{{citation needed|reason=Need RS|date=March 2016}}

==Turbine types==
Several types of [[water turbine]]s can be used in micro hydro installations, selection depending on the head of water, the volume of flow, and such factors as availability of local maintenance and transport of equipment to the site. For hilly regions where a waterfall of 50 meters or more may be available, a [[Pelton wheel]] can be used. For low head installations, [[Francis turbine|Francis]] or [[Kaplan turbine|propeller-type]] turbines are used. Very low head installations of only a few meters may use propeller-type turbines in a pit, or water wheels and Archimedes screws. Small micro hydro installations may successfully use industrial centrifugal pumps, run in reverse as prime movers; while the efficiency may not be as high as a purpose-built runner, the relatively low cost makes the projects economically feasible.

In low-head installations, maintenance and mechanism costs can be relatively high. A low-head system moves larger amounts of water, and is more likely to encounter surface debris. For this reason a [[Banki turbine]] also called [[Ossberger turbine]], a pressurized self-cleaning crossflow waterwheel, is often preferred for low-head micro hydro systems. Though less efficient, its simpler structure is less expensive than other low-head turbines of the same capacity. Since the water flows in, then out of it, it cleans itself and is less prone to jam with debris.

*[[Screw turbine]] (Reverse Archimedes' screw): two low-head schemes in England, [[Settle Hydro]] and [[Torrs Hydro, New Mills|Torrs Hydro]] use an Archimedes' screw which is another debris-tolerant design. Efficiency 85%.

*[[Kaplan turbine]] : Is a high flow, low head, propeller-type turbine. An alternative to the traditional kaplan turbine is a large diameter, slow turning, permanent magnet, sloped open flow VLH turbine with efficiencies of 90%.&lt;ref name="vlh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlh-turbine.com/EN/html/History.htm|title=Hydrovision 2015|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=n.d.|website=vlh-turbine.com|publisher=MJ2 Technologies|access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Microhydro systems are very flexible and can be deployed in a number of different environments. They are dependent on how much water flow the source (creek, river, stream) has and the velocity of the flow of water. Energy can be stored in battery banks at sites that are far from a facility or used in addition to a system that is directly connected so that in times of high demand there is additional reserve energy available. These systems can be designed to minimize community and environmental impact regularly caused by large dams or other mass hydroelectric generation sites.&lt;ref name="RISE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microhydro|url=http://www.rise.org.au/info/Tech/hydro/small.html|publisher=Research Institute for Sustainable Energy|accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential for rural development===
In relation to [[rural development]], the simplicity and low relative cost of micro hydro systems open up new opportunities for some isolated communities in need of electricity. With only a small stream needed, remote areas can access lighting and communications for homes, medical clinics, schools, and other facilities.&lt;ref name="Ashden Awards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Micro-hydro|url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/micro-hydro|publisher=The Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy|accessdate=20 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101184402/http://www.ashdenawards.org/micro-hydro|archivedate=1 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microhydro can even run a certain level of machinery supporting small businesses. Regions along the [[Andes]] mountains and in Sri Lanka and China already have similar, active programs.&lt;ref name = "Ashden Awards"/&gt; One seemingly unexpected use of such systems in some areas is to keep young community members from moving into more urban regions in order to spur economic growth.&lt;ref name = "Ashden Awards"/&gt; Also, as the possibility of financial incentives for less carbon intensive processes grows, the future of microhydro systems may become more appealing.

Micro-hydro installations can also provide multiple uses.  For instance, micro-hydro projects in rural Asia have incorporated agro-processing facilities such as rice mills{{spaced ndash}} alongside standard electrification{{spaced ndash}} into the project design.

==Cost==
The cost of a micro hydro plant can be between 1,000 and 20,000 U.S. dollars&lt;ref name="Microhydro Pros and Cons" /&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==

===Advantages===
Microhydro power is generated through a process that utilizes the natural flow of water.&lt;ref name="Wind and Hydro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microhydropower|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/pdfs/doewater-10107-vol.1-pt1.pdf|publisher=U.S. DOE|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This power is most commonly converted into electricity. With no direct [[Pollution|emission]]s resulting from this conversion process, there are little to no harmful effects on the environment, if planned well, thus supplying power from a [[Renewable resource|renewable]] source and in a [[Sustainable energy|sustainable]] manner. Microhydro is considered a "[[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-river]]" system meaning that water diverted from the stream or river is redirected back into the same watercourse.&lt;ref name="Microhydro Pros and Cons"&gt;{{cite web|title=Micro Hydro Power - Pros and Cons|url=http://www.alternative-energy-news.info/micro-hydro-power-pros-and-cons/|publisher=Alternative Energy News Network|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the potential economic benefits of microhydro is efficiency, reliability, and cost effectiveness.&lt;ref name = "Microhydro Pros and Cons"/&gt;

===Disadvantages===
Microhydro systems are limited mainly by characteristics of the site. The most direct limitation comes from small sources with minuscule flow. Likewise, flow can fluctuate seasonally in some areas.&lt;ref name = "Microhydro Pros and Cons"/&gt; Lastly, though perhaps the foremost disadvantage is the distance from the power source to the site in need of energy.&lt;ref name = "Microhydro Pros and Cons"/&gt; This distributional issue as well as the others are key when considering using a microhydro system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4970">'''Mogens Glistrup''' (28 May 1926 â 1 July 2008) was a Danish politician, lawyer and tax protester. He founded the [[Progress Party (Denmark)|Progress Party]], and was a member of the [[Folketing]] (1973â1983 and 1987â1990). He had his parliamentary immunity revoked a total of six times due to criminal convictions for tax fraud and racism.&lt;ref name="Berlingske"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Glistrups konfrontationer med loven|url=http://www.b.dk/danmark/glistrups-konfrontationer-med-loven|work=Berlingske|date=2 July 2008|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
From 1956 to 1963 Glistrup was an associate professor in tax law at the [[University of Copenhagen]], and after leaving the university he became the owner of one of Denmark's leading law firms. On national television in 1971 on the last day for sending in the tax return, he praised tax fraudsters as the "freedom fighters of our time," and he displayed his own tax card with a tax rate of zero.&lt;ref name=Skou288&gt;Skou, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; His television appearance triggered an outrage, and [[Finance Minister of Denmark|Finance Minister]] [[Poul MÃ¸ller (politician)|Poul MÃ¸ller]] made a complaint to [[Danmarks Radio]], stating that they should rather have presented factual information on filling out the tax return. The government proceeded to have police and tax authorities begin an investigation into Glistrup's finances.&lt;ref name=Skou288 /&gt;

On 22 August 1972, Glistrup founded the Progress Party, and in the [[Danish parliamentary election, 1973|landslide election of 1973]] the party gained 28 seats of 179, making it the second-largest in parliament.

Glistrup described the income tax as a remnant of the stagnant agrarian society of the past, and wanted the income tax removed over a period of seven years by gradually increasing the tax threshold.&lt;ref name=Skou289&gt;Skou, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a unique sense of humour, the most famous example of which was his suggestion to replace the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]] and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] with an answering machine saying in [[Russian language|Russian]] that Denmark surrenders.&lt;ref name=Skou289 /&gt;

The investigation of Glistrup's economic conditions dragged on but resulted in 1983 in Glistrup being sentenced by the supreme court to three years in prison and a fine of [[Danish kroner|DKK]] 1,000,000 and the parliament finding him unfit to be a member.&lt;ref name=Skou289 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''27 Ã¥r med Z''.&lt;/ref&gt; The case against him was complicated and involved an extensive web of companies that only transferred money to each other.&lt;ref name=Rehling&gt;Rehling.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecuting authority described this web of companies as fiction, to which Glistrup responded that the only fiction involved was the "fiction theory" of the prosecuting authority.&lt;ref name=Rehling /&gt;

After serving the sentence, Glistrup was reelected to parliament in 1987, but he did not manage to regain his political influence on the party from [[Pia KjÃ¦rsgaard]],&lt;ref name=Skou289 /&gt; and he was expelled from the party in 1991. He was readmitted to the party in 1999 and in response the entire parliamentary group left in protest against racist and anti-Muslim statements made by Glistrup, and formed a new parliamentary group called [[Freedom 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;Larsen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SÃ¸rensen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skou, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 1 July 2008, aged 82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Politiken]]|language=Danish|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=2008-07-02|url=http://politiken.dk/indland/article533633.ece |title=Mogens Glistrup er dÃ¸d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Civic Federation''' (NCF) was an American economic organization founded in 1900 which brought together chosen representatives of [[big business]] and [[organized labor]], as well as [[consumer]] advocates in an attempt to ameliorate labor disputes. It favored moderate progressive reform and sought to resolve disputes arising between industry and organized labor.

==History==
===Background===

One of the earliest forerunners of the National Civic Federation was the [[Chicago Civic Federation]] (CCF), which was also known as the Civic Federation of Chicago, established in 1893.

[[Ralph M. Easley]], the CCF's gregarious head who wanted the NCF to "serve as a medium of sympathy and acquaintance between persons and societies who pursue various and differing vocations and objects, who differ in nationality, creed, and surrounding [and] who are unknown to each other." This federation of civic and reform leaders community took as its primary goal "to focus the new ideals of civic cooperation and social efficiency on the task of renovating Chicago society."

Easley was thrust into the public spotlight in 1899 when the CCF held a conference in Chicago on problems presented by the various [[oligopoly|monopolistic]] [[Trust (monopoly)|Trusts]] which dominated most of the key sections of the American economy.&lt;ref name=Weinstein8&gt;James Weinstein, ''The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State, 1900-1918.'' Boston, MA: Beacon Press, 1968; pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This gathering was met by widespread acclaim in the press and provided the gravitas necessary for a larger organization drawing in the participation of top economic leaders from around the country.&lt;ref name=Weinstein8 /&gt;

===Establishment===

In June 1900 Easley reestablished his civic federation idea on a broader basis with the formation of the National Civic Federation (NCF).&lt;ref name=Cerillo&gt;Augustus Cerillo, Jr., "National Civic Federation," in John D. Beunker and Edward R. Kantowicz (eds.), ''Historical Dictionary of the Progressive Era, 1890-1920.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1988; pg. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization drew its membership in equal parts from the camps of business, labor, and members of the unaffiliated public.&lt;ref name=Cerillo /&gt; Easley would serve as chairman of the NCFâs executive council throughout the federationâs forty-five-year history.

Easley, a former teacher and journalist, was himself a staunch supporter of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and conservative who sought social peace and the preservation of the current social system through cooperation between the various social classes.&lt;ref name=Weinstein7&gt;Weinstein, ''The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State, 1900-1918,'' pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Easley believed that such collaboration between the leaders of industry and labor was necessary to mitigate potential dangers associated with a continuation and expansion of the [[class struggle]] between these social groups.&lt;ref name=Weinstein7 /&gt;

The NCF's work was conducted through special subcommittees and in national conferences. The group also produced publications, authored draft legislation, and engaged in [[lobbyist|lobbying]] of government officials.&lt;ref name=Cerillo /&gt;

Early activists included U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Lyman Gage]], the CCFâs two-time president; social worker [[Jane Addams]]; and social scientist and civic commissioner [[Edward Bemis]]. The federation's first president was wealthy businessman-turned-[[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Mark Hanna]], while its original vice-president was [[American Federation of Labor]] leader [[Samuel Gompers]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, ''The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State, 1900-1918,'' pp. 8â9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other NCF founding members from trade unions included [[Daniel Keefe]] ([[International Longshoremen's Association]]), [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]] ([[United Mine Workers of America|United Mine Workers]]) and [[J. J. Sullivan]] ([[International Typographical Union|Typographers]]).&lt;ref&gt;Christopher L. Tomlins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N7E8AAAAIAAJ ''The State and the Unions: Labor Relations, Law, and the Organized Labor Movement in America, 1880-1960.'']  CUP Archive, 1985; pg. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the federation's Executive Council included representatives of employers such as [[Vincent Astor]], [[Jeremiah Jenks]], [[Seth Low]], and [[George Walbridge Perkins|George W. Perkins]].

===Development===

From the outset the NCF was dominated by the leaders of big business.&lt;ref name="Weinstein8"/&gt; In addition to Mark Hanna, leading roles were played by utilities magnates [[Samuel Insull]] and [[George B. Cortelyou]], banker [[Franklin MacVeagh]], and industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]].&lt;ref name=Weinstein8 /&gt; By 1903 nearly one-third of the 367 American corporations with a capitalization of more than $10 million were represented in the NCF, as were 16 of the 67 biggest railroads in the country.&lt;ref name=Weinstein8 /&gt; 

During its first years of existence the NCF mediated several labor disputes and helped to broker agreements between [[bourgeoisie|capital]] and [[working class|labor]].&lt;ref name=Cerillo /&gt; The organization became active behind the scenes in a major strike of the [[coal]] industry in 1902, attempting to bring together coal operators and unionized miners to forge a solution to the work stoppage.&lt;ref name=Weinstein9&gt;Weinstein, ''The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State, 1900-1918,'' pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Employers backing the NCF's approach to the labor problem envisioned a mutually beneficial social peace springing from [[collective bargaining]]&lt;ref name=Weinstein9 /&gt; â a position sharply criticized by other employers organized in the [[National Association of Manufacturers]], which sought a crushing of [[trade unions]] and the establishment of an [[open shop]] in American industry.&lt;ref name=Weinstein12&gt;Weinstein, ''The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State, 1900-1918,'' pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Civic Federation was instrumental in expanding and helping make uniform state laws regarding [[child labor]], [[workmen's compensation]], and factory safety.&lt;ref name=Cerillo /&gt;

The NCF is credited with the passage in 1913 of the Newlands Act for mediation of [[railroad]] disputes.&lt;ref name=Cerillo /&gt; The group also helped pave the way for the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] of 1914.&lt;ref name=Cerillo /&gt;

===Decline===

With the coming of [[World War I|war in Europe]] and a drive for the armament of America under the slogan of "Preparedness," the National Civic Federation began to take on the character of a [[patriotic]] organization, agitating against [[pacifism|pacifists]], socialists, and sundry others characterized in the words of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as "undesirable citizens."&lt;ref name=Cerillo /&gt;

The death of Gompers in 1924 largely ended its relationship to the labor movement, and business leaders, too, withdrew their financial backing. Easley was consumed by [[anti-communism]], and in the 1930s attacked [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and the [[New Deal]].  Plagued by financial difficulties, hobbled by Easley's anti-Communism and pushed aside by a rising national consensus in favor of liberalism, the NCF â nearly bankrupt âshut down operations in 1950.

==Opposition==

The NCF's approach of bringing representatives of business and the labor movement together for negotiations drew criticism both from the anti-union conservatives of the National Association of Manufacturers, who opposed acknowledgement of any right of collective bargaining, as well as from [[socialism|socialists]] and [[syndicalism|syndicalists]] on the left, who saw in the NCF a concrete example of [[class collaboration|class collaborationism]] which would dull the desire of the masses for radical change.&lt;ref name=Cerillo /&gt;

One of the rivals to Samuel Gompers' [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) was the [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM). Formed on the western frontier of the United States, the WFM was "not yet 'broken in' to the discipline of business management"&lt;ref&gt;Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, ''The IWW: Its First Seventy Years.''  1976; page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; practiced by eastern labor leaders. The WFM formed the [[Western Labor Union]] (WLU) as a rival to the AFL, because the miners feared that the AFL wanted to crush the anti-capitalist spirit of their organization. Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin have written that the miners saw the purpose of the NCF as,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...to housebreak unionism, to confine its growth to those fields where management could use it, and to emasculate it by a united front of labor leaders and captains of industry against all socialistic and insurgent elements.&lt;ref name=TM11&gt;Thompson and Murin, ''The IWW,'' p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to this view, the NCF stood for "responsible unionism," in which union members were expected to follow the dictates of conservative union leaders whom Mark Hanna referred to as "the labor lieutenants of the captains of industry." Fully aware that lieutenants take orders from captains, more militant union leaders saw Gompers' participation in the NCF as a "sellout."&lt;ref name=TM11 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10998">The '''neighbourhood effect''' is an economic and social science concept that posits that neighbourhoods have either a direct or indirect effect on individual behaviors.  Although the effect of the neighbourhood was already known and studied at the beginning of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The City|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1925|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|author1=Robert E. Park |author2=Ernest W. Burgess |author3=RÐ¾derick D. McKenzie }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as early as the mid 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=London Labor and the London Poor: A Cyclopaedia of the Condition and Earnings of Those that Will Work, Those that Cannot Work, and Those that Will Not Work| author=Mayhew Henry|  year=1851| publisher=Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become a popular approach after the publication of the book ''The Truly Disadvantaged'' by William Julius Wilson in 1987. Wilson's theory suggests that living in a neighbourhood seriously affected by poverty affects a  wide  range  of  individual outcomes, such as economic self-sufficiency, violence, drug use, low birthweight, and cognitive ability.

In more recent years neighbourhood  effects have been also studied in epidemiology and psychology. For example, Murray and colleagues have shown that older workers living in areas with higher unemployment are less likely to be in work ten years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Emily T.|last2=Head|first2=Jenny|last3=Shelton|first3=Nicola|last4=Hagger-Johnson|first4=Gareth|last5=Stansfeld|first5=Stephen|last6=Zaninotto|first6=Paola|last7=Stafford|first7=Mai|date=2016-02-27|title=Local area unemployment, individual health and workforce exit: ONS Longitudinal Study|url=https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/26/3/463/2467312|journal=The European Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=26|issue=3|pages=463â469|doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckw005|issn=1101-1262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research has shown that the living conditions of the neighbourhood  interact with individual's negative life events. The same event is more likely to trigger depression in disadvantaged neighbourhoods than in neighbourhoods with a good quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=M|date=2000-12-01|title=The stress process in neighborhood context|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829200000101|journal=Health &amp; Place|volume=6|issue=4|pages=287â299|doi=10.1016/S1353-8292(00)00010-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This hypothesis is supported by Catherine Ross&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Catherine E.|date=2000|year=|title=Neighborhood Disadvantage and Adult Depression|jstor=2676304|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=41|issue=2|pages=177â187|doi=10.2307/2676304}}&lt;/ref&gt; who shows that socially disordered neighborhoods are associated with depressive symptoms.

== The Neighbourhood Effect on Voting Behavior ==
In political science the neighbourhood effect defines the tendency of a person to vote in a certain direction based upon the relational effects of the people living in the neighbourhood. The voting preference of a neighbourhood tends to be formed by consensus, where people tend to vote with the general trend of the neighbourhood. This consensus is formed by the personal connections a person forms in a community. There also seems to be some [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] correlation to voting patterns, and this has also been used to predict voting behavior.

=== History ===
The term was coined in the seminal works of Kevin Cox in 'The Voting Decision in a Spatial Context'&lt;ref&gt;K.R. Cox, ''Progress in Geography'', "The Voting Decision in a Spatial Context" (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; and later popularized by [[Ron J. Johnston]] in 'Political Geography' (1979) and  Peter J. Taylor and G. Gudgin in 'Geography of Elections' (1979)&lt;ref&gt;N. Wrigley and R.J. Bennett (eds.), ''Quantitative Geography: A British View'' (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Johnston, ''Political Geography'' (1979), Chapter 34, and P.J. Taylor and G. Gudgin, ''Geography of Elections'' (1979), Chapter 35.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems, at the time at least, that they were attempting to justify the use of mathematical modelling in the study of voting patterns and the correlations between spatial data. Both seem to have made a case that studying this is only possible with good [[Numerical data|quantitative data]] and an understanding of how people in these small spatial areas live, work, and think.

=== Miller's Models ===
W.L. Miller, however, began work on quantifying the neighbourhood effect in 1977. In his work 'Electoral Dynamics' (1977) he formed the hypothesis that "people who talk together vote together" and began trying to quantify this controversial idea.&lt;ref&gt;W.L. Miller, ''Electoral Dynamics'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; He found that majority positions are more dominant than the socio-economic statistics of individuals in the area would suggest. He suggested four models by which voting patterns may be explained:

1) The "no environmental effect" model, which postulates no differences in voting behaviour by neighbourhood type â contacts with neighbours have no influence on how people vote.

2) The "environmental effect model", which suggests that 'people may be irritated, alarmed and antagonized by contact with those unlike themselves' and become even stronger supporters of their 'class party' than might otherwise be the case â [[Middle class|middle-class]] people are more pro-Conservative in [[Working class|working-class]] than middle-class areas, for example, and working-class people are less pro-Conservative in strongly middle-class areas.

3) The "consensual environmental effect" model, which argues that 'people will be influenced towards agreement with their contacts', so that, for example, 'both middle- and working-class individuals are more Conservative in middle-class areas because both sets of individuals have fewer working-class contacts and more middle-class contacts than if they lived elsewhere' â which is what most writers associate with the neighbourhood effect.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Political Geography''.&lt;/ref&gt;

4) The "Przeworski environmental effect" model, which suggests that the two classes operate in different ways â the middle class operate according to the reactive model in working-class areas, whereas the working class operate according to the consensual model in middle-class areas.&lt;ref&gt;A. Przeworski and G.A.D Soares, ''American [[Political science|Political Science]] Review'', "Theories in Search of a Curve: A Contextual Interpretation of the Left Vote" (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston makes easier to understand social parallels that can be better understood by the layman. He explains these models as (1) I talk with them and vote as they do; (2) I want to be like them so I live with them; (3) I live among them and want to be like them; (4) what I observe around me makes me vote with them; and (5) they want me to vote for them here.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Johnston et al, ''Environment and Planning'', "Neighborhood [[social capital]] and neighborhood effects" (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cox ===
Cox, in a similar attempt to understand the neighbourhood effect, attempted to define how people interact.&lt;ref&gt;Cox. "The Voting Decision in a Spatial Context".&lt;/ref&gt; He found that there was an [[inverse relationship]] between the distance and the formation of a relationship. This seems pretty straightforward and is easily applied to one's life. He also found that the relationships that people form typically have some sort of politically partisan undertones that people take in. He also found that these relationships have more of an effect on a person's political leanings than the person's prior predispositions. This is counter-intuitive because many have argued that a person will inherit their political leanings from their family.&lt;ref&gt;C. Pattie and R. Johnston, ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', "People Who Talk Together Vote Together: 
An Exploration of Contextual Effects in [[Great Britain]]" (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtice argued against the [[social interaction]] model in 'Is Talking over the Garden Fence of Political Import?'&lt;ref&gt;J. Curtice, ''Is Talking over the Garden Fence of Political Import? (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Curtice argued, from his data set, that the influence on voting patterns by social interactions is of such small consequence as to be nearly negligible in explaining the neighbourhood effect.

=== Huckfeldt and Sprague Experiment ===
The first group that attempted to find an empirical link between social interaction and voting patterns was R. Huckfeldt and J. Sprague.&lt;ref&gt;R. Huckfeldt, J. Sprague, and J. Levine, ''American Political Science Review'', "Dynamics of Collective Deliberation in the 1996 Election: Campaign Effects on Accessibility, Certainty, and Accuracy" (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; They did a survey of people in Indianapolis and St. Louis to find who people are and whom they talk to about politics. The group also interviewed the people that the respondents identified as those they would be most likely to talk to about politics. They definitively found that people do vote in similar ways to those that they interacted with. This data finally gave some backing to Miller's idea that "people who talk together vote together." All of these experiments seem to lend some credence to the models that Cox theorized and Miller formed.

===Johnson, Phillips Shively and Stein ===
The neighborhood effect has broadened the study of the voter from the individual level of analysis to account for the effect of where one lives on their voting decisions.  This contribution to contextual analysis has broadened the study of voter behavior.

A '''nonperson''' is a [[citizen]] or a member of a group who lacks, loses, or is forcibly denied social or legal status, especially basic [[human rights]], or who effectively ceases to have a record of their existence within a society (''[[damnatio memoriae]]''), from a point of view of traceability, documentation, or existence. The term also refers to people whose death is unverifiable and about which inquiries result in a "blank wall" of "nobody knows that".

==Ways to become==

{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Voroshilov, Molotov, Stalin, with Nikolai Yezhov.jpg|image2=The Commissar Vanishes 2.jpg|width=225|caption2=A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] "nonperson" vanishes: [[commissar]] [[Nikolai Yezhov]] retouched after falling from favor and being executed in 1940.}}{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}} 

Some common ways in which people become nonpersons are: 
* Never having been sufficiently documented as existing
* Loss or deletion of the trail of documentation so that the specific person can no longer easily be linked to a documentary record or cannot be shown officially to have existed
* Covert abduction by government or other bodies combined with [[plausible deniability]]
* Long-term absence or other circumstances leading to an incorrect belief and legal documentation that they have died
* Death, when it is unverifiable and left as an open case as to what happened
* [[Fraud]]ulent reporting of a person as having died when they have not (which can happen for economic reasons in many countries, a form of [[fraud]])
* Marginalized or homeless people who live without cash or formal abode and do not appear on official records

==Legal status==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}

Asserting that someone is a nonperson is implicitly a [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] statement; by doing so, it is implied simultaneously that the person referred to is entitled to the rights that any person ''should'' have. Who is a person and what every person is entitled to depends on context and [[norm (sociology)|social norms]]. For example, [[ward (legal)|wards]] that are under the authority of a [[legal guardian]] due to [[infancy]], [[incapacity]], or [[disability]] are not usually considered nonpersons.

==Examples==
There are many possible meanings associated with the term ''nonperson''.

=== Prison camps ===
In [[Nazi]] [[extermination camps]], [[Jewish]] people and [[Romani people|Romani]] were treated as nonpersons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/gypsies.html |title=Gypsies in the Holocaust |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |editor-last=Laska |editor-first=Vera |chapter=Women in the Resistance and in the Holocaust: The Voices of Eyewitnesses. |location=Connecticut, US |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these camps was to systematically [[dehumanization|dehumanise]] these unwanted elements, use them where possible, and dispose of them efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Holocaust Genocide Studies |doi=10.1093/hgs/dcq026 |journal=Oxford Journals |first=Johannes |last=Lang |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=225â246 |pmid=20681107}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Nonperson" status was required because it removed the moral and social obstacles for committing otherwise objectionable acts of [[violence]], [[crime]], [[abuse]], and [[murder]].

===Unofficially missing people===
{{main|Forced disappearance}}

Some people are covertly held by governments or other bodies, and effectively cease to exist.  This has happened under [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]. It was also the guiding strategy behind the Nazi government's ''[[Nacht und Nebel]] (Night &amp; Fog)'' policy in Western Europe. To dodge pointed questions regarding supposedly democratically controlled governments covertly holding people or employing [[torture]], [[plausible deniability]] of knowledge might be used. The existence of [[ghost detainee]]s in a secret [[Black site|CIA prison system]] is an example of this.

To an extent, this is made both easier and harder by [[technology]] â easier because reliance upon technology is such that if a person's information is electronically deleted or was never stored in that manner they effectively cease to exist; harder because during every stage of a person's life from birth to death the accumulation of bureaucratic transactions makes it more and more likely that they will leave an official record somewhere.

=== Industrialized countries ===
A person that does not appear on any official documents, is economically or socially inactive, or lives outside of what is defined as the "productive [[system]]" or "organized [[society]]" could be classified as a nonperson. This is often the case of [[homeless]] and marginalized people in general.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Another example has been the group of [[The Erased]] in Slovenia, about 25,000 people, who lost their legal status and therefore all social, civil, and political rights after Slovenia declared its independence in 1991, because they did not register themselves in due time as "foreigners".

Also, some legally detained prisoners can be considered to be in a quasi-nonperson status, temporarily or indefinitely, to different extents depending on the reasons for and conditions of their detention. For example, in most countries, ordinary prisoners are denied political rights such as [[voting]]; in the most severe cases, total or partial isolation from the outside world can be inflicted.

=== Demonization ===
A "nonperson" status can also be consciously or unconsciously applied to unwanted persons ([[demonization]]) by their surrounding society. This can be extended and applied to an entire nation or [[ethnic group]], as often happens in wars or other conflicts.

This was the situation in the [[Nazism|Nazi]] state with regard to [[Jew]]s, and in most societies with regard to [[Romani people|gypsies]], and it is often applied in times of [[war]] to the entire enemy nation; its people are stripped of their "person status" and demonized, making them appear to be sub-human (not humans), and thus indirectly rationalizing any excess or abuse committed against them. Similar cases, concerning contra-revolutionaries, are found in most socialist states. {{citation needed|reason= Same thing can be said about revolutionaries in Capitalist states |date=August 2014}}

It can be argued that the "nonperson" status, apart from the German deathcamps, can be found in its most literal form when considering certain [[prisoners of war]], especially if they are or are considered to be [[illegal combatant]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Genesis==
{{wikinews|UN General Assembly approves measures to protect economic, social and cultural rights}}
In 1966, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]. The Covenant obliged its parties to recognise and progressively implement [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social, and cultural rights]], including [[labour rights]] and [[right to health]], [[right to education]], and [[right to an adequate standard of living]], but did not include any mechanism by which these obligations could be legally enforced.

Work on an individual complaints mechanism began in 1990, with a view to developing an Optional Protocol similar to those of other UN human rights instruments.&lt;ref name="oewg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/escr/intro.htm|accessdate=2008-07-13|publisher=UN OHCHR|title=Open-ended Working Group on an Optional Protocol to the ICESCR|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414185350/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/escr/intro.htm|archivedate=14 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Development was encouraged by the 1993 [[World Conference on Human Rights]], which recommended the Commission on Human Rights and CESCR to "continue examination of optional protocols" to the ICESCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unhcr.org/refworld/topic,459d17822,459b17a82,3ae6b39ec,O.html |title=Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Part II para 75 |publisher=[[World Conference on Human Rights]] |date=1993-07-12 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CESCR presented the first draft Optional Protocol in 1997.&lt;ref name="oewg"/&gt;  In 2002, the Committee established an open-ended working group to continue development. In 2006, the Human Rights Council gave the open-ended working group the task of formally negotiating a draft text. Negotiations were completed in April 2008, and the resulting Optional Protocol was formally adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 2008.&lt;ref name=unpr1/&gt; It was opened for signature on 24 September 2009.&lt;ref name=unpr2/&gt;

==Summary==

The Optional Protocol establishes an individual complaints mechanism for the Covenant similar to those of the [[First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] and Article 14 of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]].  Parties agree to recognise the competence of the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] to consider complaints from individuals or groups who claim their rights under the Covenant have been violated.&lt;ref&gt;OP-ICESCR, Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Complainants must have exhausted all domestic remedies, and anonymous complaints and complaints referring to events which occurred before the country concerned joined the Optional Protocol are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;OP-ICESCR, Article 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee can request information from and make recommendations to a party.&lt;ref&gt;OP-ICESCR, Articles 6, 8 and 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Parties may also opt to permit the Committee to hear complaints from other parties, rather than just individuals.&lt;ref&gt;OP-ICESCR, Article 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol also includes an inquiry mechanism. Parties may permit the Committee to investigate, report on and make recommendations on "grave or systematic violations" of the Covenant. Parties may opt out of this obligation on signature or ratification.&lt;ref&gt;OP-ICESCR, Article 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Optional Protocol required ten ratifications to come into force.&lt;ref name=Art18/&gt;

The '''[[Patrons of Industry]]''' in Manitoba was an extension of a farmers' organization operating in Ontario (see [[Patrons of Industry]]) and the United States in the 1880s and 1890s. The Patrons lobbied extensively and became politically active, running provincial and federal candidates.

The Manitoba Patrons, as a fraternal organization, was initially focused on coordinating an agrarian cooperative movement on the Prairies.

Its first lodges in Manitoba and the North-West Territories began in 1890, with a "grand lodge" (central body) established in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon Mail, March 12, 1896, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; At first the group was known as the "Patrons of Manitoba and the North-West" - its conventions included delegates from Manitoba and the territorial districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon Mail, January 25, 1894&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's leader was [[Charles Braithwaite]], who was chosen at a convention held in November 1891.

Through direct bulk buying in competition with established stores, the movement brought down the price of farm supplies (binder twine) and other farmers' needs, and through strong lobbying it helped achieve a cut in tariffs on imported goods important to farmers.

The Manitoba group turned to direct political action in 1894.  Following a tour of Manitoba by Braithwaite (who was a spellbinding orator), the Patrons nominated candidates in all but two of the province's constituencies, in anticipation of the next provincial election.

The Patrons were the first "third party" to emerge in Manitoba after partisan government was formally introduced to the province in 1888.  They opposed both [[Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba|Conservatives]] and [[Manitoba Liberal Party|Liberals]] and were for a time affiliated with [[Dalton McCarthy]], a dissident federal Conservative.

On August 23, 1894, the Patrons proved they were a significant force in Manitoba politics when their candidate [[John Forsyth (Manitoba politician)|John Forsyth]] defeated Conservative leader [[John Andrew Davidson]] in a two-sided [[Beautiful Plains]] by-election (there was no Liberal candidate in the race). Forsyth was expelled from the Patrons in 1895 for using a railway pass (given free to legislators) in violation of party policy.

The party became internally divided over the [[Manitoba Schools Question]].  Many Catholic Patrons were alienated by the party's support of Liberal Premier [[Thomas Greenway]]'s efforts to eliminate denominational schools, and left the party.

The Patrons ran seven candidates in the [[Manitoba general election, 1896|provincial election of 1896]], and two of them were elected: [[Watson Crosby]] in Dennis and [[William Sirett]] in Beautiful Plains.

The Patrons ran candidates in two Manitoba provincial by-elections in 1896 who were not successful. (On the other hand, Matt McCauley was elected with official Patron backing in Edmonton (Alberta) in the 1896 North-West Assembly election.) &lt;ref&gt;Ed. Bulletin, August 13, 1896, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Manitoba Patrons (Braithwaite, Crosby and Sirett) ran in the [[Canadian federal election, 1896|1896 federal election]], but were unsuccessful, finishing third in their ridings.

Braithwaite, who had led the party since 1891, stepped down as party leader in January 1897, and the party effectively ceased to exist after this time.  Crosby died in 1897, and Sirett did not run for re-election in 1899.

In addition to supporting agrarian interests, the Patrons also supported prohibition, universal suffrage (for men and women) and electoral reform.  These policies would later re-emerge in the platform of the [[Progressive Party of Canada]] and other farmer political parties such as the [[United Farmers of Manitoba]] and the [[United Farmers of Alberta]].

'''Peter Ferdinand Drucker''' ({{IPAc-en|Ë|d|r|Ê|k|Ér}}; {{IPA-de|ËdÊÊkÉ|lang}}; November 19, 1909&amp;nbsp;â November 11, 2005) was an Austrian-born American management consultant, educator, and author, whose writings contributed to the philosophical and practical foundations of the modern business [[corporation]]. He was also a leader in the development of management education, he invented the concept known as [[management by objectives]] and [[self-control]],&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F. "Reflections of a Social Ecologist," ''Society'', May/June 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and he has been described as "the founder of modern management".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Best Of Peter Drucker |author=Denning, Steve |work=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2014/07/29/the-best-of-peter-drucker/ |date=August 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Drucker grew up in what he referred to as a "liberal" [[Lutheran]] Protestant household in [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F., ''The Ecological Vision: Reflections on the Human condition'', 2016, p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Caroline Bondi had studied medicine and his father Adolf Drucker was a lawyer and high-level civil servant.&lt;ref name="Drucker, Peter F. 1979"&gt;Drucker, Peter F. ''Adventures of a Bystander'', 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Drucker was born in Vienna, Austria, in a small village named Kaasgraben (now part of the 19th district of [[Vienna-DÃ¶bling]]).&lt;ref name="in progress01"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020908141241/http://www.peterdrucker.at/en/bio/bio_01.html Peter F. Drucker: A Biography in Progress], p. 1, at his website&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in a home where intellectuals, high government officials, and scientists would meet to discuss new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Beatty, Jack. ''The World According to Peter Drucker'', 2016, pp. 5â7.&lt;/ref&gt; These included [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. [[Hans Kelsen]] was his uncle.&lt;ref name=DSA&gt;{{cite web|title=Drucker's childhood and youth in Vienna|url=http://www.druckersociety.at/index.php/peterdruckerhome/biography|website=Drucker Society of Austria|publisher=Drucker Society of Austria|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from DÃ¶bling [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in 1927,&lt;ref name=DSA/&gt; Drucker found few opportunities for employment in post-[[First World War|World War I]] Vienna, so he moved to [[Hamburg]], Germany, first working as an apprentice at an established cotton trading company, then as a journalist, writing for ''[[Der Ãsterreichische Volkswirt]]'' (''The Austrian Economist'').&lt;ref name="Drucker, Peter F. 1979"/&gt; Drucker then moved to [[Frankfurt]], where he took a job at the Daily ''Frankfurter General-Anzeiger''.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F. ''Adventures of a Bystander'', 1979, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Frankfurt, he also earned a doctorate in [[international law]] and public law from the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary: Peter Drucker, 95, Economist Who Prized Value of Workers," ''The New York Times'', 13 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Drucker left Germany for England.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F.;Cohen, William. ''A Class with Drucker: The Lost Lessons of the World's Greatest Management Teacher'', 2007, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[London]], he worked for an insurance company, then as the chief economist at a private bank.&lt;ref name="in progress06"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020929090738/http://www.peterdrucker.at/en/bio/bio_06.html Peter F. Drucker: A Biography in Progress], p. 6, at this website&lt;/ref&gt;  He also reconnected with Doris Schmitz, an acquaintance from the University of Frankfurt, and they married in 1934.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;[http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/dac&amp;CISOPTR=3463&amp;REC=1 Certified copy of Peter and Doris Druckerâs marriage certificate], The Drucker Institute Archives, Box 39, Folder 11, Claremont, California.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple permanently relocated to the United States, where he became a university professor as well as a freelance writer and business consultant.

In 1943, Drucker became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. He then had a distinguished career as a teacher, first as a professor of politics and philosophy at [[Bennington College]] from 1942 to 1949, then twenty-two years at [[New York University]] as a Professor of Management from 1950 to 1976.

Drucker went to California in 1971, where he developed one of the country's first executive [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] programs for working professionals at [[Claremont Graduate University]] (then known as Claremont Graduate School). From 1971 until his death, he was the Clarke Professor of [[Social Science]] and Management at Claremont.&lt;ref name="TheEssential"&gt;''The Essential Drucker'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Claremont Graduate University's management school was named the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management in his honor in 1987 (later renamed the [[Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management]]). He established the Drucker Archives at Claremont Graduate University in 1999; the Archives became the Drucker Institute in 2006. Drucker taught his last class in 2002 at age 92. He continued to act as a consultant to businesses and nonprofit organizations well into his nineties.

Drucker died November 11, 2005 in [[Claremont, California]] of natural causes at 95.&lt;ref name=wapoobit&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111101938.html |title=Management Visionary Peter Drucker Dies |author=Sullivan, Patricia |publisher=''Washington Post'' |date=November 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had four children and is the grandfather of tech entrepreneur [[Nova Spivack]], one of six grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/3897.asp | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827031958/http://www.cgu.edu/pages/3897.asp | dead-url=yes | archive-date=27 August 2006 | title=Peter F.

==Work and philosophy==

===Early influences===
Among Drucker's early influences was the Austrian economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]], a friend of his father's, who impressed upon Drucker the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;Beatty, Jack. ''The World According to Peter Drucker'', 1998, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Drucker was also influenced, in a much different way, by [[John Maynard Keynes]], whom he heard lecture in 1934 in [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F. ''The Ecological Vision: Reflections on the Human Condition'', 1993, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; "I suddenly realized that Keynes and all the brilliant economic students in the room were interested in the behavior of commodities," Drucker wrote, "while I was interested in the behavior of people."&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F., ''The Ecological Vision'', 1993, pp. 75â76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next 70 years, Drucker's writings would be marked by a focus on relationships among human beings, as opposed to the crunching of numbers. His books were filled with lessons on how organizations can bring out the best in people, and how workers can find a sense of community and dignity in a modern society organized around large institutions.&lt;ref name="druckerinstitute.com"/&gt; As a business consultant, Drucker disliked the term "guru," though it was often applied to him; "I have been saying for many years," Drucker once remarked, "that we are using the word 'guru' only because 'charlatan' is too long to fit into a headline."&lt;ref&gt;"Peter Drucker, the man who changed the world," ''Business Review Weekly'', 15 September 1997, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young writer, Drucker wrote two pieces&amp;nbsp;â one on the conservative German philosopher [[Friedrich Julius Stahl]] and another called "''[http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/dac&amp;CISOPTR=3415&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=1 The Jewish Question in Germany]''"&amp;nbsp;â that were burned and banned by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="bw2005"/&gt;

===The 'business thinker'===
Drucker's career as a business thinker took off in 1942, when his initial writings on politics and society won him access to the internal workings of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors (GM)]], one of the largest companies in the world at that time. His experiences in Europe had left him fascinated with the problem of authority. He shared his fascination with [[Donaldson Brown]], the mastermind behind the administrative controls at GM. In 1943 Brown invited him in to conduct what might be called a "political audit": a two-year social-scientific analysis of the corporation. Drucker attended every board meeting, interviewed employees, and analyzed production and decision-making processes.

The resulting book, ''[[Concept of the Corporation]]'', popularized GM's multidivisional structure and led to numerous articles, consulting engagements, and additional books. GM, however, was hardly thrilled with the final product. Drucker had suggested that the auto giant might want to re-examine a host of long-standing policies on customer relations, dealer relations, employee relations and more. Inside the corporation, Drucker's counsel was viewed as hypercritical. GM's revered chairman, [[Alfred Sloan]], was so upset about the book that he "simply treated it as if it did not exist," Drucker later recalled, "never mentioning it and never allowing it to be mentioned in his presence."&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F., ''Adventures of a Bystander'', p. 288, (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Drucker taught that management is "a liberal art," and he infused his management advice with [[interdisciplinary]] lessons from history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, culture and religion.&lt;ref name="druckerinstitute.com"/&gt; He also believed strongly that all institutions, including those in the private sector, have a responsibility to the whole of society. "The fact is," Drucker wrote in his 1973 ''Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices'', "that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers. If the managers of our major institutions, and especially of business, do not take responsibility for the common good, no one else can or will."&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F., ''Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices'', 1973, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drucker was interested in the growing effect of people who worked with their minds rather than their hands. He was intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues, and yet had to cooperate with others in a large organization. Rather than simply glorify the phenomenon as the epitome of human progress, Drucker analyzed it, and explained how it challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run.

His approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century. By that time large corporations had developed the basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierarchies of [[mass production]]. Executives thought they knew how to run companies, and Drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs, lest organizations become stale. But he did so in a sympathetic way. He assumed that his readers were intelligent, rational, hardworking people of good will. If their organizations struggled, he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas, a narrow conception of problems, or internal misunderstandings.

Drucker developed an extensive consulting business built around his personal relationship with top management. He became legendary among many of post-war Japan's new business leaders trying to rebuild their war-torn homeland. He advised the heads of [[General Motors]], [[Sears]], [[General Electric]], [[W.R. Grace]] and [[IBM]], among many others. Over time he offered his management advice to nonprofits like the [[American Red Cross]] and the [[Salvation Army]]. His advice was eagerly sought by the senior executives of the [[Adela Investment Company]], a private initiative of the world's multinational corporations to promote investment in the developing countries of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/drucker/2012/09/11/how-to-consult-like-peter-drucker/ | work=Forbes | first=Rick | last=Wartzman |title= How to Consult Like Peter Drucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drucker's writings===
Drucker's 39 books have been translated into more than thirty-six languages. Two are novels, one an [[autobiography]]. He is the co-author of a book on [[Japanese painting]], and made eight series of educational films on management topics. He also penned a regular column in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' for 10 years and contributed frequently to the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', and ''[[The Economist]]''.

His work is especially [[Big in Japan (phrase)|popular in Japan]], even more so after the publication of "[[Moshidora|What If the Female Manager of a High-School Baseball Team Read Drucker's ''Management"'']], a novel that features the main character using one of his books to great effect, which was also adapted into an anime and a [[Moshidora (film)|live action film]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16481583 Drucker in the dug-out], A Japanese book about Peter Drucker and baseball is an unlikely hit, The Economist, July 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His popularity in Japan may be compared with that of his contemporary [[W. Edwards Deming]].&lt;ref&gt;''Outcome-Based Religions: Purpose-Driven Apostasy,'' Mac Dominick, "The quest begins by looking into the lives of two men, Edwards Deming and Peter Drucker. Deming (now deceased) and Drucker (in his mid 90s) are enshrined as internationally renowned experts in business management and gurus of business methodology. These two individuals were among the primary players in a select group of Americans (Though Drucker is a U.S. citizen, he is actually Austrian.) who are lauded as part of the almost super-human effort that developed systems-based management philosophies that first gained public recognition in post-World War II Japan. The popular story is told of the Americans who developed a cutting edge business methodology that was rejected by western business but eagerly embraced by the Japanese.", quoted at [http://www.crossroad.to/Quotes/TQM.html Total Quality Management (TQM)]&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Ross M. Brown credits Peter Drucker and Ferrel Heady in the late 1980's with the initial development of his groundbreaking New Religion theory that suggests that ciguatera outbreaks caused by warm climatic conditions in part propelled the migratory voyages of Polynesians via distinct "public" management and administration efforts between 1000 and 1400AD.

Peter Drucker also wrote a book in 2001 called ''The Essential Drucker''. It is the first volume and combination of the past sixty years of Peter Drucker's work on management. The information gathered is a collection from his previous findings, The Practice of Management (1954) to Management Challenges for the 21st Century (1999), this book offers, in Drucker's words, "a coherent and fairly comprehensive introduction to management". He also answers frequently asked questions from up and coming entrepreneurs who tend to ponder the questionable outcomes of management.&lt;ref name="TheEssential" /&gt;

===Key ideas===
Drucker is considered the single most important thought leader in the world of management, and several ideas run through most of his writings:
* Decentralization and simplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchanan|first=Leigh|title=Peter Drucker from A to Z|url=http://www.inc.com/articles/2009/11/drucker.html|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Inc. magazine|date=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drucker discounted the [[Command and control (management)|command and control]] model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized. According to Drucker, corporations tend to produce too many products, hire employees they don't need (when a better solution would be [[outsourcing]]), and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid.
* The concept of "[[knowledge worker]]" in his 1959 book ''The Landmarks of Tomorrow''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=Landmarks of Tomorrow|year=1957|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=New York|pages=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-SrBghhPRUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=landmarks%20of%20tomorrow&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=knowledge%20work&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-56000-622-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, knowledge-based work has become increasingly important in businesses worldwide.
* The prediction of the death of the "[[Blue Collar]]" worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=The Age of Social Transformation|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/95dec/chilearn/drucker.htm|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changing face of the US Auto Industry is a testimony to this prediction.
* The concept of what eventually came to be known as "[[outsourcing]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wartzman|first=Rick|title=Insourcing and Outsourcing: the Right Mix|url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He used the example of "front room" and "back room" of each business: A company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its core business. Back room activities should be handed over to other companies, for whom these tasks are the front room activities.
* The importance of the nonprofit sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=What Business Can Learn from Nonprofits|url=http://hbr.org/1989/07/what-business-can-learn-from-nonprofits/ar/1|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Harvard Business Review|date=July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he calls the third sector (private sector and the Government sector being the first two). Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world.
* A profound skepticism of [[macroeconomic]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=Schumpeter And Keynes|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/10/10/schumpeter-keynes-economics-biz-cz_pd_1011schumpeter.html|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Forbes|date=23 May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies.
* A lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is [[price]], citing its lack of showing what products actually do for us,&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, P.F., ''Innovation and Entrepreneurship'', p250 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; thereby stimulating commercial interest in discovering how to calculate what products actually do for us, from their price.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell. C.J. 'Commercial Knowledge on Innovation Economics', [http://www.techmatt.com/techmatt/Commercial_Knowledge_On_Innovation_Economics.pdf A Report], (2014) pp. 1-11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Respect for the worker. Drucker believed that employees are assets not liabilities. He taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy, and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employee's value to the organization. Central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organization's most valuable resource, and that a manager's job is both to prepare people to perform and give them freedom to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, P. F., Collins, J., Kotler, P., Kouzes, J., Rodin, J., Rangan, V. K., et al., ''The Five Most Important Questions You Will Ever Ask About your Organization'', p. xix (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* A belief in what he called "the sickness of government." Drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need and/or want, though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government. The chapter "The Sickness of Government"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=The Age of Discontinuity|year=1969|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Zp7_rJ1vcMC&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=drucker%20%22sickness%20of%20government&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q=drucker%20%22sickness%20of%20government&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-56000-618-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''The Age of Discontinuity'' formed the basis of [[New Public Management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollitt and Bouckaert|first=Christopher and Geert|title=Public Management Reform|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=38|url=https://books.google.com/?id=epPWAutxrFQC&amp;lpg=PP2&amp;dq=%22new%20public%20management%22%20drucker&amp;pg=PP2#v=onepage&amp;q=drucker&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-19-959508-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the 1980s and 1990s.
* The need for "planned [[Abandonment (legal)|abandonment]]." Businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to "yesterday's successes" rather than seeing when they are no longer useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices|year=1974|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|pages=84â5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9a5SAlaY-X4C&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=drucker%20%22planned%20abandonment%22&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-7506-4389-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure.
* The [[sense of community|need for community]]. Early in his career, Drucker predicted the "end of economic man" and advocated the creation of a "plant community"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=The Future of Industrial Man|year=1942|publisher=The John Day Company|location=New York|pages=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqSDMzKbHpsC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=drucker%20the%20future%20of%20industrial%20man&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=plant%20community&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-56000-623-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; where an individual's social needs could be met. He later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized, and by the 1980s, suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=Managing the Non-Profit Organization|year=1990|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|page=xii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwAf_g_GnFgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=drucker%20managing%20nonprofit&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q=community&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-7506-2691-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals, rather than subordinating an institution to a single value.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F., ''The Practice of Management'', pp 62-63, (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F., ''Managing for the Future'', p. 299, (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of [[management by objectives]] and self-control forms the keynote of his 1954 landmark ''The Practice of Management''.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F., ''The Practice of Management'', p. 12, (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;
* A company's primary responsibility is to [[customer service|serve its customers]]. [[Profit (accounting)|Profit]] is not the primary goal, but rather an essential condition for the company's continued existence and [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F., ''The Practice of Management '' (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;
* A belief in the notion that great companies could stand among humankind's noblest inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter F., ''The Five Most Important Questions You Will Ever Ask About Your Organization'', p. 54, (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Do what you do best and outsource the rest" is a business tagline first "coined and developed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haus|first1=Marian|title=Best 10 Peter Drucker Quotes|url=http://pmseed.com/best-10-peter-drucker-quotes/|website=pmseed thoughts on managing project work|publisher=pmseed|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s by Drucker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vitasek|first1=Kate|title=A New way to Outsource|journal=Forbes|date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. Drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as 1989 in his Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article entitled "Sell the Mailroom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drucker|first1=Peter|title=Sell the Mailroom|journal=Wall Street Journal|date=15 November 2005|issue=Manager's Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113202230063197204|accessdate=27 April 2015|publisher=Dow Jones Company|postscript=Reprint from July 25, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 by way of recognition, Drucker was posthumously inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=The International Association of Outsourcing Professionals|title=PETER DRUCKER INDUCTED INTO THE OUTSOURCING HALL OF FAME|url=http://www.druckerinstitute.com/link/peter-drucker-inducted-into-the-outsourcing-hall-of-fame/|website=Drucker Institute|publisher=Drucker Institute|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An idea of so-called "Noncustomers". In ''Managing in the Next Society'', Drucker pointed to the department store as Exhibit A. "Nobody knew more about their customers than did these stores," Drucker explained. "But they had no information about noncustomers. They had 28% of the retail market, the largest single share. However, this meant that 72% didn't shop at department stores. And the department stores had no information on these people. And they couldn't have cared less."

== Criticism ==
''The Wall Street Journal'' researched several of his lectures in 1987 and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts. Drucker was off the mark, for example, when he told an audience that the English language was the official language for all employees at Japan's [[Mitsui]] trading company. Drucker defended himself: "I use anecdotes to make a point, not to write history."

Also, while Drucker was known for his prescience, he was not always correct in his forecasts. He predicted, for instance, that the nation's financial center would shift from New York to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;"Peter Drucker, Leading Management Guru, Dies at 95," ''Bloomberg'', 11 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others maintain that one of Drucker's core concepts," [[management by objectives]]," is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively. Critic [[Dale Krueger]] said that the system is difficult to implement and that companies often wind up overemphasizing control, as opposed to fostering creativity, to meet their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, Dale. ''Strategic Management and Management by Objectives'', Small Business Advancement National Center, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drucker's classic work, ''[[Concept of the Corporation]]'', criticized [[General Motors]] while it was considered the most successful corporation in the world. Many of GM's executives considered Drucker [[wikt:persona non grata#Noun|persona non grata]] for a long time afterward. Although [[Alfred P. Sloan]] refrained from personal hostility toward Drucker, he considered Drucker's critiques of GM's management to be "dead wrong."&lt;ref name="Drucker_1990_new_foreword"&gt;Drucker, Peter.

[[File:Voting in Berkley (2150673984).jpg|thumb|A Californian voter fills out a provisional ballot form while voting in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 United States presidential election]]]]
In [[elections in the United States]], a '''provisional ballot''' is used to record a vote when there are questions about a given voter's eligibility that must be resolved before the vote can count. The [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[Help America Vote Act|Help America Vote Act of 2002]] guarantees that, in most states, the voter can cast a provisional ballot if the voter states that he or she is entitled to vote.&lt;ref name="NCSL"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/provisional-ballots.aspx|title=Provisional Ballots|last=National Conference of State Legislatures|first=|date=|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most common reasons to cast a provisional ballot include:

*The voter's name does not appear on the [[electoral roll]] for the given [[Polling place|precinct]] (polling place), because the voter is not registered to vote or is registered to vote elsewhere
*The voter's eligibility cannot be established or has been challenged
*The voter lacks a [[photo identification]] document (in jurisdictions that require one)
*The voter requested to vote by [[absentee ballot]] but claims to have not received, or not cast, the absentee ballot
*The voter's registration contains inaccurate or outdated information such as the wrong address or a misspelled name
*In a [[closed primary]] (limited to members of a [[political party]]), the voter's party registration is listed incorrectly&lt;ref name="NCSL" /&gt;

Whether a provisional ballot is counted is contingent upon the verification of that voter's eligibility, which may involve local election officials reviewing government records or asking the voter for more information, such as a photo identification not presented at the polling place or proof of residence.&lt;ref name="NCSL" /&gt; Each state may set its own timing rules for when these issues must be resolved. Provisional ballots therefore cannot usually be counted until after the day of the election.&lt;ref name="NCSL" /&gt;

==History==
The right of [[political parties]] to have observers at [[polling place]]s is long-standing.&lt;ref&gt;Title XIV, Chapter 5, Sec. 4922, [https://archive.org/details/electionlawsofst00ohiorich The Election Laws of the State of Ohio], Ohio Secretary of State, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the established roles for such observers is to act as challengers, in the event that someone attempts to vote at the polling place who is not eligible to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.state.mn.us/docs/challenger_faq_2008.pdf Election Day "Challengers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106224959/http://www.sos.state.mn.us/docs/challenger_faq_2008.pdf |date=2008-11-06 }}, [http://www.sos.state.mn.us/ Minnesota Secretary of State], June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the implementation of provisional ballots, some state laws allowed a voter whose eligibility was challenged to cast a ''challenged ballot''.&lt;ref name="NCSL" /&gt; After the polls closed, the canvassing board was then charged with examining the challenged ballots and determining whether the challenge was to be upheld or not.

The Help America Vote Act brings a degree of uniformity to the array of various challenged ballot rules enacted by various states. For example, each state must provide a means for the voter to find out whether his or her ballot was counted, though the states may use different ways of doing so (such as a website or a phone number).&lt;ref name="NCSL" /&gt;

Though the Act mandates the use of provisional ballots nationwide, it exempted the six states that had been exempted from the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]] because those states had and continue to have either "same-day" [[Voter registration in the United States|voter registration]] or no registration requirement at all: [[Idaho]], [[Minnesota]], [[New Hampshire]], [[North Dakota]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref name="NCSL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra|title=The National Voter Registration Act Of 1993 (NVRA) {{!}} CRT {{!}} Department of Justice|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those states may choose to use provisional ballots. {{As of|2015}}, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming used them for some purposes, while the other three did not have provisional ballots at all.&lt;ref name="NCSL" /&gt;

==Potential problems==

In the 2018 midterm elections, both valid and invalid provisional ballots were mixed together in Florida after the initial vote count, which provided no way to be separated for the recount.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=EL |title=Ballot mixup puts more heat... |url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/broward-elections-official-brenda-snipes-mixed-illegal-provisional-ballots-with-valid-ones |website=Fox News |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer scientist and election official [[Douglas W. Jones]] has criticized the offer of a provisional ballot as "a way to brush off troublesome voters by letting them think they have voted."&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas W. Jones]], [http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/voting/cbc2004.shtml Reliability of US Voting Systems], Prepared Remarks for the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] Hearing on election preparedness
October 7, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed the concern that, under some states' laws, casting a provisional ballot at the wrong precinct would [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchise]] voters who could have cast valid ballots had they been redirected to the proper precinct.

==Rates of acceptance==

According to the Election Assistance Commission thousands of provisional ballots are not counted each election.

The [[2004 US Presidential Election]] was the first presidential election conducted under the Help America Vote Act's provisions. Nationwide, at least 1.9 million provisional ballots were cast, and 676,000 were never counted due to various states' rules on counting provisional ballots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2006/1103nj1.htm Let The Recounts Begin (National Journal)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108225527/http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2006/1103nj1.htm |date=2006-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the use of provisional ballots in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 general election in the United States]] show that around 21% of provisional ballots were rejected. About 44% of these were cast by voters who were not registered, but many other rejections were for reasons that were "preventable," such as an incorrect precinct or missing signature.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.advancementproject.org/pdfs/Provisional-Ballot-Report-Final-9-16-08.pdf Provisional Voting: Fail-Safe Voting or Trapdoor to Disenfranchisement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022184913/http://www.advancementproject.org/pdfs/Provisional-Ballot-Report-Final-9-16-08.pdf |date=2008-10-22 }}, [http://www.advancementproject.org/ Advancement Project], Sept. 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The rates of rejection vary widely across the states, with some states counting all or nearly all provisional ballots while others reject more than half.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Real estate economics''' is the application of economic techniques to [[real estate market]]s. It tries to describe, explain, and predict patterns of prices, [[supply and demand|supply, and demand]]. The closely related field of  '''housing economics''' is narrower in scope, concentrating on residential real estate markets, while the research of  '''real estate trends''' focuses on the business and structural changes affecting the industry. Both draw on partial equilibrium analysis ([[supply and demand]]), [[urban economics]], [[spatial economics]], basic and extensive research, surveys, and [[finance]].

==Overview of real estate markets==
The main participants in real estate markets are:

* '''Owner/user''': These people are both owners and tenants. They purchase houses or [[commercial property]] as an investment and also to live in or utilize as a business.
* '''Owner''': These people are pure investors. They do not consume the real estate that they purchase. Typically they rent out or lease the property to someone else.
* '''Renter''': These people are pure consumers.
* '''Developers''': These people prepare raw land for building, which results in new products for the market.
* '''Renovators''': These people supply refurbished buildings to the market.
* '''Facilitators''': This group includes [[bank]]s, [[real estate broker]]s, lawyers, government regulators, and others that facilitate the purchase and sale of real estate.
The owner/user, owner, and renter form the demand side of the market, while the developers and renovators form the supply side. In order to apply simple supply and demand analysis to real estate markets, a number of modifications need to be made to standard [[microeconomic]] assumptions and procedures. In particular, the unique characteristics of the real estate market must be accommodated. These characteristics include:
* '''Durability.''' Real estate is durable. A building can last for decades or even centuries, and the land underneath it is practically indestructible. Because of this, real estate markets are modeled as a ''stock/flow market''. About 98% of supply consists of the stock of existing houses, while about 2% consists of the flow of new development. The stock of real estate supply in any period is determined by the existing stock in the previous period, the rate of deterioration of the existing stock, the rate of renovation of the existing stock, and the flow of new development in the current period. The effect of real estate market adjustments tend to be mitigated by the relatively large stock of existing buildings.
* '''Heterogeneity.''' Every unit of real estate is unique in terms of its location, the building, and its financing. This makes pricing difficult, increases search costs, creates [[information asymmetry]], and greatly restricts substitutability. To get around this problem, economists, beginning with Muth (1960), define supply in terms of service units; that is, any physical unit can be deconstructed into the services that it provides. Olsen (1969) describes these units of housing services as an ''unobservable theoretical construct''. Housing stock depreciates, making it qualitatively different from new buildings. The market-equilibrating process operates across multiple quality levels. Further, the real estate market is typically divided into residential, commercial, and industrial segments. It can also be further divided into subcategories like recreational, income-generating, historical or protected, and the like.
* '''High transaction costs.''' Buying and/or moving into a home costs much more than most types of transactions. The costs include search costs, real estate fees, moving costs, legal fees, land transfer taxes, and deed registration fees. Transaction costs for the seller typically range between 1.5% and 6% of the purchase price. In some countries in continental Europe, transaction costs for both buyer and seller can range between 15% and 20%.
* '''Long time delays.''' The market adjustment process is subject to time delays due to the length of time it takes to finance, design, and construct new supply and also due to the relatively slow rate of change of demand. Because of these lags, there is great potential for disequilibrium in the short run. Adjustment mechanisms tend to be slow relative to more fluid markets.
* '''Both an investment good and a consumption good.''' Real estate can be purchased with the expectation of attaining a return (an investment good), with the intention of using it (a consumption good), or both. These functions may be separated (with market participants concentrating on one or the other function) or combined (in the case of the person that lives in a house that they own). This dual nature of the good means that it is not uncommon for people to [[Over-investing|over-invest]] in real estateâthat is, to invest more money in an asset than it is worth on the open market.
*'''Immobility.''' Real estate is locationally immobile (save for [[mobile home]]s, but the land underneath them is still immobile). Consumers come to the good rather than the good going to the consumer. Because of this, there can be no physical marketplace. This spatial fixity means that market adjustment must occur by people moving to dwelling units, rather than the movement of the goods. For example, if tastes change and more people demand suburban houses, people must find [[housing]] in the suburbs, because it is impossible to bring their existing house and lot to the suburb (even a mobile home owner, who could move the house, must still find a new lot). Spatial fixity combined with the close proximity of housing units in urban areas suggest the potential for externalities inherent in a given location.

==Demand for housing==
The main determinants of the demand for housing are [[demographic]]. But other factors, like income, price of housing, cost and availability of [[credit (finance)|credit]], consumer preferences, investor preferences, price of substitutes, and price of complements, all play a role.

The core [[demographics|demographic]] variables are population size and population growth: the more people in the economy, the greater the demand for housing. But this is an oversimplification. It is necessary to consider family size, the age composition of the family, the number of first and second children, net migration ([[immigration]] minus [[emigration]]), non-family household formation, the number of double-family households, [[death rate]]s, [[divorce rate]]s, and marriages. In housing economics, the elemental unit of analysis is not the individual, as it is in standard partial [[Equilibrium model of group development|equilibrium models]]. Rather, it is households, which demand housing services: typically one household per house. The size and demographic composition of households is variable and not entirely exogenous. It is endogenous to the housing market in the sense that as the price of housing services increase, household size will tend also to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ejobm.org/images/Journals/issue_1/EFFECTS%20OF%20ECONOMIC%20FACTORS%20ON%20PERFORMANCE%20OF%20REAL%20ESTATE%20IN%20KENYA.pdf|title=Effects of Economic Factors on performance of Real Estate in Kenya|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Income is also an important determinant. Empirical measures of the [[income elasticity of demand]] in North America range from 0.5 to 0.9 (De Leeuw 1971). If [[permanent income hypothesis|permanent income]] elasticity is measured, the results are slightly higher (Kain and Quigley 1975) because transitory income varies from year to year and across individuals, so positive transitory income will tend to cancel out negative transitory income. Many housing economists use permanent income rather than annual income because of the high cost of purchasing real estate. For many people, real estate will be the costliest item they will ever buy.

The price of housing is also an important factor. The [[price elasticity of demand|price elasticity]] of the demand for housing services in North America is estimated as negative 0.7 by Polinsky and Ellwood (1979), and as negative 0.9 by Maisel, Burnham, and Austin (1971).

An individual household's housing demand can be modeled with standard utility/choice theory. A [[utility function]], such as U=U(X1,X2,X3,X4,...Xn), can be constructed, in which the household's utility is a function of various goods and services (Xs). This will be subject to a [[budget constraint]] such as P1X1+P2X2+...PnXn=Y, where Y is the household's available income and the Ps are the prices for the various goods and services. The equality indicates that the money spent on all the goods and services must be equal to the available income. Because this is unrealistic, the model must be adjusted to allow for borrowing and saving. A measure of wealth, lifetime income, or permanent income is required. The model must also be adjusted to account for the heterogeneity of real estate. This can be done by deconstructing the utility function. If housing services (X4) are separated into its constituent components (Z1,Z2,Z3,Z4,...Zn), the utility function can be rewritten as U=U(X1,X2,X3,(Z1,Z2,Z3,Z4,...Zn)...Xn). By varying the price of housing services (X4) and solving for points of optimal utility, the household's demand schedule for housing services can be constructed. Market demand is calculated by summing all individual household demands.

==Supply of housing==
[[File:5659-Linxia-City-real-estate-agents-office.jpg|thumb|A customer perusing real estate listings at an agent's office in [[Linxia City]], China]]
Housing supply is produced using land, labor, and various inputs, such as electricity and building materials. The quantity of new supply is determined by the cost of these inputs, the price of the existing stock of houses, and the technology of production. For a typical single-family dwelling in suburban North America, approximate cost percentages can be broken down as follows: acquisition costs, 10%; site improvement costs, 11%; labour costs, 26%; materials costs, 31%; finance costs, 3%; administrative costs, 15%; and marketing costs, 4%. Multi-unit residential dwellings typically break down as follows: acquisition costs, 7%; site improvement costs, 8%; labour costs, 27%; materials costs, 33%; finance costs, 3%; administrative costs, 17%; and marketing costs, 5%. Public subdivision requirements can increase development costs by up to 3% depending on the jurisdiction. Differences in building codes account for about a 2% variation in development costs. However, these subdivision and building code costs typically increase the market value of the buildings by at least the amount of their cost outlays. A [[production function]] such as ''Q''=''f''(''L'',''N'',''M'') can be constructed in which ''Q'' is the quantity of houses produced, ''N'' is the amount of labour employed, ''L'' is the amount of land used, and ''M'' is the amount of other materials. This production function must, however, be adjusted to account for the refurbishing and augmentation of existing buildings. To do this, a second production function is constructed that includes the stock of existing housing and their ages as determinants. The two functions are summed, yielding the total production function. Alternatively, a [[hedonic regression|hedonic pricing]] model can be regressed.

The long-run [[price elasticity of supply]] is quite high. George Fallis (1985) estimates it as 8.2, but in the short run, supply tends to be very price inelastic. Supply price elasticity depends on the elasticity of substitution and supply restrictions. There is significant substitutability, both between land and materials and between labour and materials. In high-value locations, multi-story concrete buildings are typically built to reduce the amount of expensive land used. As labour costs have increased since the 1950s, new materials and capital-intensive techniques have been employed to reduce the amount of labour used. However, supply restrictions can significantly affect substitutability. In particular, the lack of supply of skilled labour (and labour union requirements) can constrain the substitution from capital to labour. Land availability can also constrain substitutability if the area of interest is delineated (i.e., the larger the area, the more suppliers of land, and the more substitution that is possible). Land-use controls such as zoning bylaws can also reduce land substitutability.

==Adjustment mechanism==
The basic adjustment mechanism is a stock/flow model to reflect the fact that about 98% the market is existing stock and about 2% is the flow of new buildings.
[[Image:Real estate economics - basic model.png|right]]
In the adjacent diagram, the stock of housing supply is presented in the left panel while the new flow is in the right panel. There are four steps in the basic adjustment mechanism. First, the initial equilibrium price ('''Ro''') is determined by the intersection of the supply of existing housing stock ('''SH''') and the demand for housing ('''D'''). This rent is then translated into value ('''Vo''') via discounting cash flows. Value is calculated by dividing current period rents by the discount rate, that is, as a perpetuity. Then value is compared to construction costs ('''CC''') in order to determine whether profitable opportunities exist for developers. The intersection of construction costs and the value of housing services determine the maximum level of new housing starts ('''HSo'''). Finally the amount of housing starts in the current period is added to the available stock of housing in the next period. In the next period, supply curve '''SH''' will shift to the right by amount '''HSo'''.

==Adjustment with depreciation==
[[Image:Real estate economics - with depreciation.png|right]]
The diagram to the right shows the effects of depreciation. If the supply of existing housing deteriorates due to wear, then the stock of housing supply depreciates. Because of this, the supply of housing ('''SHo''') will shift to the left (to '''SH1''') resulting in a new equilibrium demand of '''R1''' (since the number of homes decreased, but demand still exists). The increase of demand from '''Ro''' to '''R1''' will shift the value function up (from '''Vo''' to '''V1'''). As a result, more houses can be produced profitably and housing starts will increase (from '''HSo''' to '''HS1'''). Then the supply of housing will shift back to its initial position ('''SH1''' to '''SHo''').

==Increase in demand==
[[Image:Real estate economics - increase in demand in short run.png|right|500px]] 
The diagram on the right shows the effects of an increase in demand in the short run. If there is an increase in the demand for housing, such as the shift from '''Do''' to '''D1''' there will be either a price or quantity adjustment, or both. For the price to stay the same, the supply of housing must increase. That is, supply '''SHo''' must increase by '''HS'''.

==Increase in costs==
[[Image:Real estate economics - increase in cost in short run.png|right]]

The diagram on the right shows the effects of an increase in costs in the short-run. If construction costs increase (say from '''CCo''' to '''CC1'''), developers will find their business less profitable and will be more selective in their ventures. In addition some developers may leave the industry. The quantity of housing starts will decrease ('''HSo''' to '''HS1'''). This will eventually reduce the level of supply (from '''SHo''' to '''SH1''') as the existing stock of housing depreciates. Prices will tend to rise (from '''Ro''' to '''R1''').

==Real estate financing==

There are different ways of real estate financing: governmental and commercial sources and institutions. A homebuyer or builder can obtain financial aid from savings and loan associations, commercial banks, savings banks, [[mortgage]] bankers and brokers, [[life insurance]] companies, [[credit union]]s, federal agencies, individual investors, and builders.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Over the last decade, residential prices increased every year on average by double digits in Beijing or Shanghai. However many observers and researchers argue that fundamentals of the housing sector, both sector-specific and macroeconomic, may have been the driving force behind housing price volatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chieco.2016.10.011 |title=Fundamentals and the volatility of real estate prices in China: A sequential modelling strategy |journal=China Economic Review |volume=48 |pages=205â222 |year=2018 |last1=Deng |first1=Yongheng |last2=Girardin |first2=Eric |last3=Joyeux |first3=Roselyne }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Savings and loan associations===
{{main article|Savings and loan association}}

The most important purpose of these institutions is to make mortgage loans on residential property. These organizations, which also are known as [[savings association]]s, [[building and loan association]]s, [[cooperative bank]]s (in [[New England]]), or homestead associations (in  [[Louisiana]]), are the primary source of financial assistance to a large segment of American homeowners.&lt;ref name="multiple2"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mishler, Lon |author2=Cole, Robert E. |title=Consumer and business credit management |publisher=Irwin |location=Homewood |year=1995 |pages=123â128 |isbn=978-0-256-13948-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As home-financing institutions, they give primary attention to single-family residences and are equipped to make loans in this area.

Some of the most important characteristics of a savings and loan association are:&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt;

# It is generally a locally owned and privately managed home-financing institution.
# It receives individuals' savings and uses these funds to make long-term amortized loans to home purchasers.
# It makes loans for the construction, purchase, repair, or refinancing of houses.
# It is state or federally chartered.

===Commercial banks===
{{main article|Commercial bank}}

Due to changes in banking laws and policies, commercial banks are increasingly active in home financing. In acquiring mortgages on real estate, these institutions follow two main practices:&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt;

# Some banks maintain active and well-organized departments whose primary function is to compete actively for real estate loans. In areas lacking specialized real estate financial institutions, these banks become the source for residential and farm mortgage loans.
# Banks acquire mortgages by simply purchasing them from mortgage bankers or dealers.

In addition, dealer service companies, which were originally used to obtain car loans for permanent lenders such as commercial banks, wanted to broaden their activity beyond their local area. In recent years, however, such companies have concentrated on acquiring mobile home loans in volume for both commercial banks and savings and loan associations. Service companies obtain these loans from retail dealers, usually on a non-recourse basis. Almost all bank or service company agreements contain a credit insurance policy that protects the lender if the consumer defaults.&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt;

===Savings banks===
{{main article|Savings bank}}

These depository [[Financial institution|financial institutions]] are federally chartered, primarily accept consumer deposits, and make home mortgage loans.&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt;

===Mortgage bankers and brokers===
{{main article|Mortgage broker}}

Mortgage bankers are companies or individuals that originate mortgage loans, sell them to other investors, service the monthly payments, and may act as agents to dispense funds for taxes and insurance.

Mortgage brokers present homebuyers with loans from a variety of loan sources. Their income comes from the lender making the loan, just like with any other bank. Because they can tap a variety of lenders, they can shop on behalf of the borrower and achieve the best available terms. Despite legislation that could favor major banks, mortgage bankers and brokers keep the market competitive so the largest lenders must continue to compete on price and service. According to Don Burnette of Brightgreen Homeloans in Port Orange, Florida, "The mortgage banker and broker conduit is vital to maintain competitive balance in the mortgage industry. cWithout it, the largest lenders would be able to unduly influence rates and pricing, potentially hurting the consumer. Competition drives every organization in this industry to constantly improve on their performance, and the consumer is the winner in this scenario."&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt;

===Life insurance companies===
[[Life insurance]] companies are another source of financial assistance. These companies lend on real estate as one form of investment and adjust their portfolios from time to time to reflect changing economic conditions. Individuals seeking a loan from an insurance company can deal directly with a local branch office or with a local real estate broker who acts as loan correspondent for one or more insurance companies.&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt;

===Credit unions===
{{main article|Credit union}}

These cooperative financial institutions are organized by people who share a common bondâfor example, employees of a company, labor union, or religious group. Some credit unions offer home loans in addition to other financial services.&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt;

===Federally supported agencies===
Under certain conditions and fund limitations, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) makes direct loans to creditworthy veterans in housing credit shortage areas designated by the VA's administrator. Such areas are generally rural and small cities and towns not near the metropolitan or commuting areas of large citiesâareas where GI loans from private institutions are not available.

The federally supported agencies referred to here do not include the so-called second-layer lenders who enter the scene after the [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] is arranged between the lending institution and the individual home buyer.&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt;

===Real estate investment trusts===
{{main article|Real estate investment trust}}

Real estate investment trusts ([[REIT]]s), which began when the [[Real Estate Investment Trust Act]] became effective on January 1, 1961, are available. REITs, like savings and loan associations, are committed to real estate lending and can and do serve the national real estate market, although some specialization has occurred in their activities.&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt;

In the [[United States]], REITs generally pay little or no [[federal income tax]] but are subject to a number of special requirements set forth in the  [[Internal Revenue Code]], one of which is the requirement to annually distribute at least 90% of their taxable income in the form of [[dividend]]s to shareholders.

===Other sources===
{{main article|Creative real estate investing}}

Individual investors constitute a fairly large but somewhat declining source of money for home mortgage loans. Experienced observers claim that these lenders prefer shorter-term obligations and usually restrict their loans to less than two-thirds of the value of the residential property. Likewise, building contractors sometimes accept second mortgages in partial payment of the construction price of a home if the purchaser is unable to raise the total amount of the down payment above the first mortgage money offered.&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt;

In addition, homebuyers or builders can save their money using [[FSBO]] in order not to pay extra fees.

The '''Ricardian contract''', as invented by Ian Grigg in 1996, is a method of recording a document as a [[contract]] at law, and linking it securely to other systems, such as accounting, for the contract as an issuance of value.&lt;ref&gt;I. Grigg. The Ricardian Contract. In Proceedings of the First IEEE International
Workshop on Electronic Contracting, pages 25-31. IEEE, 2004. http://iang.org/papers/ricardian_contract.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3085682 What is a Ricardian Contract?] ''Cyberspace Law eJournal'': Social Science Research Network (SSRN). 11 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is robust through use of identification by [[cryptographic hash function]], transparent through use of readable text for legal prose and efficient through [[markup language]] to extract essential information.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, "What is a Ricardian Contract?," Quora, 2012 https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-Ricardian-Contract&lt;/ref&gt;

A Ricardian contract places the defining elements of a legal agreement in a format that can be expressed and executed in software.&lt;ref&gt;Clack, Bakshi, Braine, "Smart Contract Templates: foundations, design landscape and research directions," 2016 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00771.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The key is to make the format both machine readable, such that they can easily be extracted for computational purposes, and readable as an ordinary text document such that lawyers and contracting parties may read the essentials of the contract conveniently.&lt;ref&gt;Nagy &amp; Shakel "OpenPGP-based Financial Instruments and Dispute Arbitration," 2008 in ''Proceedings of Financial Cryptography but
 and Data Security'' 2008 Springer and slides https://ifca.ai/fc08/presentations/7-2-nagy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

From a legal perspective, the use of [[markup language]] embedded within a mostly legal prose document leads to reduced transaction costs, faster dispute resolution, better enforceability and enhanced transparency.&lt;ref&gt;Nagy &amp; Shakel op cit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nagy, "On Digital Cash-like Payment Systems," 2006 in ''Proceedings of the International Conference on e-Business and Telecommunications'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt; From a computing perspective, the Ricardian contract is a [[software design pattern]] to digitize documents and have them participate within financial transactions, such as payments, without losing any of the richness of the contracting tradition. Publication of the content and reference to that content by the unique [[cryptographic message digest]] eliminates frauds based on multiple presentations.&lt;ref&gt;Nagy 2006 op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

The method arises out of the work of Ian Grigg completed in the mid-1990s in contributions to Ricardo,&lt;ref&gt;Grigg, "Financial Cryptography in 7 Layers," ''Proceedings of Financial Cryptography Conference 2000,'' Anguilla, British West Indies, February 2000 Springer Verlag LNCS 1962 http://iang.org/papers/fc7.html&lt;/ref&gt; a system of assets transfers that was built in 1995-1996 by Systemics and included the pattern. The system and the design pattern was named after [[David Ricardo]] in honour of his seminal contribution to [[international trade theory]].

==Definition==
"A Ricardian contract can be defined as a single document that is 
a) a contract offered by an issuer to holders, 
b) for a valuable right held by holders, and managed by the issuer, 
c) easily readable (like a contract on paper), 
d) readable by programs (parsable like a database), 
e) digitally signed,
f) carrying the keys and server information, and 
g) allied with a unique and secure identifier." &lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2004, op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagram==
The Ricardian contract separates the agreement of parties across time and domain. On the left of the "Bowtie" representation,{{what|date=June 2018}} the negotiation and formation of a legally binding contract leads to a single parent document that defines all of the intent of that agreement.  On the right, the performance of that agreement might involve many transactions to be accounted for, logically separated from the meaning of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Fujimura &amp; Terada, "Trading among Untrusted Parties via the Voucher Trading System," in ''Towards the E-Society'', 2002 - Springer https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-306-47009-8_32#page-5&lt;/ref&gt; The join between the legal world and the accounting world is formed by the hash â each transaction locks in the terms and conditions of the precise deal of the parties by including the hash of the contract in every relevant transaction record, yet the operation of the transactions and the issuance of the contract are cleanly separated and thus perverse incentives are eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Franco, "14.5 Open Transactions," ''Understanding Bitcoin: Cryptography, Engineering and Economics,'' John Wiley &amp; Sons 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RC-bow-tie.png|thumb|500px|right|BowTie diagram of Ricardian contract elements &amp; generatives]]

==Legal relationship==
The role of the Ricardian Contract is to capture the contractual relationship between contracting parties to assist later performance of that contract by programs.&lt;ref&gt;Batlin, "Crypto 2.0 Musings - Combining Ricardian and Smart Contracts," 2016 LinkedIn blog, https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/crypto-20-musings-combining-ricardian-smart-contracts-alex-batlin&lt;/ref&gt;  In its contractual form, it is the recording of an offer from an issuer to a holder.  The offer is signed digitally within the format by the offerer, typically using a plaintext digital signature such as provided by [[OpenPGP]].
The acceptance of the [[contract]] is typically formed by signing / agreeing to a transaction that refers to the hash of that contract.  Within the context of a high performance payment system, a secure payment will cite the hash of the contract of the instrument being paid, as well as paying and payee parties and a quantity of units.&lt;ref&gt;Howland (1996) "Development of an Open and Flexible Payment System," http://systemics.com/docs/sox/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In a [[smart contracts]] system, the acceptance would be performed by operating the contract's code to move the state of the agreement forward.

===Signing and Intent===
Typically, the signing of the contract by any party is overtly performed by use of a private key. The original offerer's signature is typically over the original document, and is then appended to form a fully binding, readable offer for the assets described in the document.&lt;ref&gt;Dorier, "Colored Coins and Ricardian Contracts," 2014 blog post, http://blog.coinprism.com/2014/12/10/colored-coins-and-ricardian-contracts/&lt;/ref&gt;
Later participation by parties in the contract such as payments or smart contract performance will typically sign over a hash identifier (as generated by a [[cryptographic hash function]]) over the signed original document.  In contrast to the initial signature, the use of the hash of the contract within following transactions also signals intent, and forms a covert signature over the contract. Although private key signatures are well studied and are subject of legal frameworks such as the European digital signature directive, Grigg suggests that the trail of hashes - entanglement - forms a more effective evidence of intent &lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2004, op cit&lt;/ref&gt; than a private key signature.

==Programming Pattern==
As a pattern in design, the Ricardian Contract is like a reference - object [[tuple]] from the tradition of [[Object-oriented Programming]]. 
The reference is a [[cryptographic hash function]], and the object is formed by writing classes that handle the type of contract needed; a [[Factory (object-oriented programming)]] would typically read enough of the text of the document to figure out which class type is involved, and then construct an object of that specific class over the text.
Once an object is constructed, it can be interrogated for contents:  the hash, name of issuer, nature of issue, keys and signature status.

==Variations==
If the agreement is more complicated than a single document can describe, the documents can be chained: An acceptance of an offer can be a Ricardian Contract that includes the hash of the offer, or the acceptance can include the entire contents of the earlier phase, a design pattern known as Russian dolls &lt;ref&gt;Odom (2013), "Sample Currency Contract," http://opentransactions.org/wiki/index.php/Sample_Currency_Contract&lt;/ref&gt; used by both OpenTransactions and [[OpenBazaar]].  These referral patterns can be conducted multiple times to create a chain or hierarchy of elements.

==Formats==
A key decision is the formatting of the text such that minimal [[markup language]] can be inserted to assist the software agent while maintaining readability.&lt;ref&gt;Wittenberger, "Contracts in A-Coin Wallets," BALL retrieved 2016 http://ball.askemos.org/A0cd6168e9408c9c095f700d7c6ec3224/?_v=search&amp;_id=1856&amp;_go=5&lt;/ref&gt; To be a Ricardian Contract, it has to be parsable both by the program and by a human reader.&lt;ref&gt;WÃ¶rner, et al "The Bitcoin Ecosystem - Disruption beyond Financial Services?," 2016 https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/publications/248647&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the format has to support a [[canonical form]] hash ([[cryptographic hash function]]), that is, have a way of delivering a hash over contents that does not change due to common [[serialisation]] and transmission artifacts.
[[LaTeX]] or [[Ini file format]] are suitable because they allow consistent readability by humans.
Popular and standardised formats such as [[JSON]], [[XML]] and [[Semantic Web]] might appeal to programmers but provide less readability to jurists. &lt;ref&gt;Webfunds, "Ricardian Implementations," 2000 - 2016 http://webfunds.org/guide/ricardian_implementations.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Batlin, op cit&lt;/ref&gt; Some formats also suffer from too much markup flexibility such as whitespace which makes hashing and signing hard.

==Relationship to Smart Contracts==
[[Smart contract]]s, as defined in the work of [[Nick Szabo]] are an abstract concept relating to the automated performance of an already agreed contract,&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, "Smart Contracts" 1994 {{cite web |url=http://szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620185026/http://szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html |archivedate=2016-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the Ricardian contract is a design pattern to capture the intent of the agreement of the parties, before its performance.&lt;ref&gt;Braendgaard, "Simple Convention for Human Readable Terms for Smart Contracts," 2016 https://blog.stakeventures.com/articles/smart-contract-terms&lt;/ref&gt;
By means of a hashes within as references or links to external documents, above, the Ricardian Contract form easily extends to refer to code.&lt;ref&gt;Clack, op cit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grigg, "The Sum of all Chains - Let's Converge", 2015 Coinscrum http://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/001556.html&lt;/ref&gt; The explicit referral to the code can pass legitimacy from over-arching legal prose to the code, thus implementing the concept of the smart contract.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Carlyle, Grigg, Hearne. "Corda: An Introduction," 2016 http://r3cev.com/s/corda-introductory-whitepaper-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Refactoring to describe blockchains and to integrate references to smart contract logic created a hybrid version of the Ricardian Contract.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2015 op cit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grigg, "On the intersection of Ricardian and Smart Contracts," 2015 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WgAoioqbV8JUNOmHVFo16D88e59mVj2SzFpFg2jmBx4&lt;/ref&gt; This form proposes a tuple of {prose, parameters, code} where the parameters can particularise or specialise the legal prose and the computer code in order to create a single deal out of a template or library of components.&lt;ref&gt;Clack, op cit&lt;/ref&gt;  Also known as a Ricardian triple, it can describe blockchains, smart contracts, IoT devices and persons.

==Implementations==

There are several explicit extant implementations of the Ricardian contract design pattern and there are some projects which do so implicitly and others which are heading in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;WebFunds op cit&lt;/ref&gt;
Amongst those explicitly using the pattern are:

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}The '''ruling party''' or '''governing party or political party''' in a [[democracy|democratic]] [[parliamentary system]] is the current [[political party]] or [[coalition]] of the majority in [[parliament]], that administers the affairs of [[Sovereign state|state]]. In many other [[democratic republic]] countries, the ruling party is the party of the elected president that is in charge of the [[executive branch]] of government. Within a parliamentary system, the majority in the [[legislature]] also controls the [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch of government, thus leaving no possibility of opposing parties concurrently occupying the executive and legislative branches of government, such as in an American style [[presidential system]] where the party of the [[president]] does not necessarily also have a legislative majority. 

A ruling party is also used to describe the party of [[one-party state]]s, such as the [[Communist Party of China]] in the [[People's Republic of China]]. In his political manifesto ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'', the late [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] attacked the ability of the ruling party, using it as a basis for his opposition to [[Partisan (political)|partisan politics]]. This is an example of methods and rationale that [[dictatorship]]s espouse to establish an unchanging monolithic society, [[Tyrant|tyrannical rule]] and [[autocracy]], without any participatory opportunities offered to a population.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2481">The '''Second League of Armed Neutrality''' or the '''League of the North''' was an [[military alliance|alliance]] of the north [[Europe]]an [[naval]] powers [[DenmarkâNorway]], [[Prussia]], [[Sweden]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. It occurred between 1800 and 1801 during the War of the [[Second Coalition]] and was initiated by [[Paul I of Russia]]. It was a revival of the [[First League of Armed Neutrality]] (1780), which had been quite successful during the [[American War of Independence]] in isolating Britain and resisting attempts to interfere with their shipping. The Second League was less successful than the First.

The Second League was intended to protect [[Neutral country |neutral]] [[shipping]] against the [[Royal Navy]]'s wartime policy of unlimited search of neutral shipping for [[First French Republic|French]] [[contraband]], in an attempt to cut off military supplies and other trade to the [[First French Republic]]. The British government, not yet anxious to preserve Russian goodwill, openly considered it a form of alliance with France and attacked Denmark, destroying parts of its fleet in the first [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]] and forcing it to withdraw from the League. Britain also occupied the [[Danish West Indies]] between March 1801 and April 1802.

In addition to this, [[Prussia]] invaded [[Electorate of Brunswick-Luneburg|Hanover]] in April 1801 as a way to attack the British. Paul's death in March 1801 and the accession of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] led to a change of policy in Russia, and the alliance collapsed.  Russia later joined the British in a coalition against Napoleonic France.

==Legacy==

The prospect of a third league of armed neutrality potentially including Britain and France was briefly proposed in the 1860s,  during the [[American Civil War]], following the [[Trent Incident]] in which the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] stopped a British vessel and removed two [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] diplomats. Ultimately the two countries did not form a league but did maintain the principle of the freedom of the seas, and both remained neutral.

The '''Serbian Progressive Party''' ({{lang-sr|Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ° Ð½Ð°Ð¿ÑÐµÐ´Ð½Ð° ÑÑÑÐ°Ð½ÐºÐ°/Srpska napredna stranka}} or '''CHC'''/'''SNS''') is a [[populist]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cepolicy.org/news/post-election-serbia-good-news-eu Post election Serbia: good news for the EU? | cepolicy.org&lt;!-- Botovski generisani naziv --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[conservative]] [[List of political parties in Serbia|political party]] in [[Serbia]].

Founded in 2008 as a split from the [[Serbian Radical Party]] (SRS), the culmination of a decade-long conflict within the SRS between the party's moderate and hard-line wings, the SNS managed to retain the former's [[national conservatism|national conservative]] outlook, while adopting distinct [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] policies.

This combination has transformed the SNS into the current [[ruling party]] in Serbia, being the senior party in the current government coalition, the party's leader [[Aleksandar VuÄiÄ]] in turn serving as the [[President of Serbia]]. As of August 2018, the party holds 96 seats in the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.gov.rs/national-assembly/composition/political-parties/political-parties.500.html|title=National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia - Political Parties|website=www.parlament.gov.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:NikoliÄ &amp; VuÄiÄ.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tomislav NikoliÄ and Aleksandar VuÄiÄ at the SNS founding convention on 21 October 2008.]]
The Serbian Progressive Party was formed by a group of 21 former [[Serbian Radical Party]] (SRS) [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] led by [[Tomislav NikoliÄ]]. Disenchanted with the direction of the party, the [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-EU]] members&lt;ref name="b92"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=18&amp;nav_id=79833|title=Poll: Progressive Party is pro-EU, but its voters are not|publisher=B92|date=18 April 2012|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; left and formed the ''Forward Serbia'' parliamentary group. The SNS was founded and held its first congress meeting on 21 October 2008.&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=24&amp;nav_id=53724 |title=NikoliÄ party to be called "Serb Progressive" |publisher=B92 |date=September 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928191726/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=24&amp;nav_id=53724 |archivedate=September 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the Serbian Radical Party's representatives elected in the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2008|2008 parliamentary election]], 21 moved to the Serbian Progressive Party, while 57 remained in the SRS.

In 2011, the SNS formed a pre-election coalition with [[New Serbia]], the [[Strength of Serbia Movement]] and the [[Movement of Socialists]] to participate in the 2012 election.&lt;ref&gt;http://pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/199240/Predsedni%C5%A1tvo+NS%3A+Nikoli%C4%87+nosilac+liste+SNS-NS-PSS-PS.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]], the party led the "[[Let's Get Serbia Moving]]" coalition and gained 55 seats out of 73 won by the coalition in the National Assembly. Party leader Tomislav NikoliÄ defeated [[Boris TadiÄ]] of the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] in the second round of the [[Serbian presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=20&amp;nav_id=80345 |title=Tomislav NikoliÄ wins in presidential runoff |publisher=B92 |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523070408/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=20&amp;nav_id=80345 |archivedate=May 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his election as [[President of Serbia]], NikoliÄ stepped down as leader of the party on 24 May 2012, leaving deputy president [[Aleksandar VuÄiÄ]] in charge until a successor was elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=24&amp;nav_id=80417 |title=Serbia's new president quits as party leader |publisher=B92 |date=24 May 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221121000/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=24&amp;nav_id=80417 |archivedate=February 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; VuÄiÄ was the only candidate who ran for the party leadership, and was elected on 29 September 2012, with [[Jorgovanka TabakoviÄ]] as his deputy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=29&amp;nav_id=82410 |title=Progressives elect new leader, deputy leader |publisher=B92 |date=29 September 2012 |accessdate=29 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204034947/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=29&amp;nav_id=82410 |archivedate=February 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the [[People's Party (Serbia, 2008)|People's Party]] led by ex-Mayor of Novi Sad [[Maja GojkoviÄ]], merged into the SNS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/356156/Maja-Gojkovic-Narodna-partija-kolektivno-presla-u-SNS|title=Maja GojkoviÄ: Narodna partija kolektivno preÅ¡la u SNS|publisher=Blic|language=Serbian|date=3 December 2012|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sons of the American Legion'''  is a patriotic service organization formed on September 12â15, 1932. The S.A.L. is made up of male descendants of people who served in the [[United States Armed Forces]] during times specified by the [[American Legion]].&lt;ref name="SAL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legion.org/sons/history|title=History of Sons of the American Legion|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sons of the American Legion's mission to serve veterans, the military and their families is carried out through its hundreds of outreach programs delivered by its members, volunteers and national headquarters.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/19927/American-Legion|title=American Legion|publisher=[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sons of the American Legion's national headquarters is located in [[Indianapolis]].

==Mission==
Their main mission is to sponsor programs that its parent organization, [[American Legion|The American Legion]], does to improve veterans communities, such as [[scholarships]], veterans help programs (i.e. ending veterans homelessness), and [[youth athletics|youth sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Program|url=http://www.legion.org/programs|publisher=The American Legion|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also promote [[National Security of the United States|national security]], [[American patriotism|patriotism]], and devotion to veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.legion.org/about|publisher=The American Legion|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginnings===
The establishment of the ''Sons of the American Legion'' as a non-political, no-sectarian civilian organization was authorized by action of the 14th National Convention of the ''American Legion'' in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] September 12â15, 1932.

In 1939, the S.A.L. was riding the crest and had a numerical size of about seven percent as large as the parent organization. The S.A.L. organization seemed destined to grow even larger, but looming on the horizon was [[World War II]]. With the passing of time, thousands of young men suddenly found themselves old enough to be in the armed services.

Many of the S.A.L. members never returned from World War II and those that did found that their service had made them eligible to join the ranks of the ''American Legion'' itself, which, in 1942 opened the door to the returning World War II [[veterans]].

Membership dropped from a high of 72,633 in 1939 to a low of 5,631 in 1953. Many factors caused the lean years for the S.A.L. program. The former S.A.L., now veterans of World War II, had no grown children in the immediate postwar years. Housing shortages, a nation on the move, the [[G.I. Bill]] that sent thousands of veterans back to school, and the [[Korean War]] that put reservists back in uniform were some of the contributing factors.

===1960â1999===
However, by 1963, enrollment had climbed to nearly 17,000. In noting this renewed growth, the National Executive Committee, in regular meetings assembled in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], April 30 â May 1, 1964, [passed Resolution 22, urging that the S.A.L. program "be encouraged and implemented by internal promotion and increased public recognition through the national Headquarters staff and the various Departments of the ''American Legion''." Approval was given for the S.A.L. to conduct their first National S.A.L. Workshop during the Legion's National Convention in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] in 1964.

In noting a need for a small national body to give the S.A.L. program national direction and stimulation, the Legion's NEC gave its approval to Resolution 60 at its May 8â9, 1969, meeting in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. Resolution 60 created a four-member Sons of the American Legion Committee.

After conducting a long and detailed study of the over-all organizational structure of the S.A.L., the ''Sons of the American Legion Committee'' reported that there was a "definite need for a national ''Sons of the American Legion'' organization and the updating of the National Constitution and By-Laws of the S.A.L., as approved by the Legion's NEC back in May 1933, and be subsequently amended".

At its fall meeting in Indianapolis, IN, October 17â18, 1973, the Legion gave its approval to Resolution 15, abolishing the National S.A.L. Committee created by Resolution 60 by the Legion's NEC  at its meeting May 8â9, 1969, in St. Louis, MO. Residual responsibilities of the National S.A.L. Committee are now assigned to the Legion's National Internal Affairs Commission.

Since 1988, The Sons have raised more than $7 million for the American Legion Child Welfare Foundation.&lt;ref name="SAL"/&gt;

===2000âpresent===
In early to mid 2014, ''mySAL'' was launched to ''Sons of the American Legion'' squadron adjutants can now access membership information, reports and electronic membership tools online. On September 2, 2014, ''MyVA'' was launched as an initiative to help veterans. As of 2016, the membership total is over 360,000.&lt;ref name="SAL"/&gt;

==Programs==
At the state level, the S.A.L. is organized into "departments", which run annual civic training events for high school juniors called [[Boys State]].  Two members from each Boys State are selected for [[Boys Nation]]. The [[American Legion Auxiliary]] runs [[Girls State]] and [[Girls Nation]]. In addition to Boys State, the S.A.L., division of the ''American Legion'', features numerous programs including American Legion Baseball, Scouting, Oratorical Contests, Junior Shooting Sports, Youth Alumni, the American Legion Riders, and Scholarships at every level of the organization.

===MyVA===
Launched on September 2, 2014, MyVA is an initiative which will reorient VA around Veteran needs and empower employees to assist them in delivering excellent customer service to improve the Veteran experience. It is the largest department-wide transformation in VAâs history and will be a product of ideas and insights shared by Veterans, employees, members of Congress, VSOs, and other stakeholders.
The first phase of MyVA has included creating the task force and building the team to support the mission and an organizational change of this breadth.  MyVA is focused on five areas of improvement:

* Improving the Veteran experience
* Improving the employee experience so they can better serve Veterans
* Improving internal support services
* Establishing a culture of continuous improvement, and
* Enhancing strategic partnerships.

==Organizational structure==
[[File:Jackson Legion Hall WY1.jpg|right|thumb|Jackson Legion Hall in [[Jackson, Wyoming]]]]

===Squadron===
The squadron is the basic unit of the Legion and usually represents a small geographic area such as a single town or part of a county. There are roughly 14,900 posts in the United States. The squadron is used for formal business such as meetings and a coordination point for community service projects. Often the squadron will host community events such as bingo, Hunter breakfasts, holiday celebrations, and available to the community, churches in time of need. It is also not uncommon for the Post to contain a bar open during limited hours. An S.A.L. squadron member is distinguished by a French blue garrison cap with red, white and blue piping.

===Counties===
Each U.S. county comprises several squadrons and oversees their operations, led by a County Council of elected officers. The County Commander performs annual inspections of the Posts within their jurisdiction and reports the findings to both the District and the Department level. An S.A.L. County member is distinguished by a French blue garrison cap with white piping.

===Districts===
Each squadron is divided into Divisions and/or Districts. Each District oversees several squadrons, generally about 20, to help each smaller group have a larger voice. Divisions are even larger groups of about four or more Districts. The main purpose of these "larger" groups (DistrictsâDivisions) is to allow one or two delegates to represent an area at conferences, conventions, and other gatherings, where large numbers of Legionnaires may not be able to attend. A District member is distinguished by a French blue garrison cap with a white crown and red, white and blue piping.

===Detachments===
The squadrons are grouped together into a state level organization known as a Detachment for the purposes of coordination and administration. There is a total of 55 Detachments; one for each of the 50 states, the [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[France]], [[Mexico]], and the [[Philippines]]. [[Canada]] was merged into Department of New York several years ago. The three Detachments located overseas are intended to allow active duty military stationed and veterans living overseas to be actively involved with the American Legion similar to as if they were back in the States. The Detachment of France consists of 29 Posts located in 10 European counties, the Detachment of Mexico consists of 22 Posts located in Central America, and the Detachment of Philippines covers Asia and the Pacific Islands. A Detachment member is distinguished by a French blue garrison cap with a gold crown and red, white and blue piping.

===National headquarters===
[[File:American Legion National Headquarters, Indianapolis Indiana.jpg|right|thumb|American Legion National Headquarters, Indianapolis]]
The main S.A.L. Headquarters is located on the [[Indiana World War Memorial Plaza]] in Indianapolis. It is the primary office for the National Commander and also houses the historical archives, library, Membership, Internal Affairs, Public Relations, and the Magazine editorial offices. The Legion also owns a building in Washington D.C. that contains many of the operation offices such as Economics, Legislative, Veterans Affairs, Foreign Relations, National Security, and Media Relations. A National member is distinguished by a gold garrison cap with a gold crown and red, white and blue piping.

==mySAL==
National Headquarters developed the website to mimic [http://myLegion.org myLegion], which assists a post, district, county, and state officers with their membership needs. Download an authorization form at [http://www.mySAL.org mySAL] to start the process of creating a squadron account. Once an account is created, you can login here: [https://www.members.legion.org/CGI-BIN/lansaweb?wam=MYSINTRO&amp;webrtn=WR_SalIntro&amp;ml=LANSA:XHTML&amp;part=TAL&amp;lang=ENG mySAL].''Sons of the American Legion'' squadron adjutants can now access membership information, reports and electronic membership tools online. As of April 2015, Detachments now have access to the website which  provides membership information, reports and electronic membership tools such as data change forms for all squadrons within their Detachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legion.org/sites/legion.org/files/legion/documents/sal_newsletter_spring_15.pdf|title=National Update Official Publication of the Sons of The American Legion Spring 2015|accessdate=November 1, 2015|work=legion.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In October 2009  ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Lord Paul had been unable satisfactorily to explain claiming expenses of Â£38,000 for the period January 2005 to July 2006. Lord Paul immediately requested the Clerk of the Parliaments to investigate his expenses at the same time repaying,  Â£41,982 instead of Â£26,988 â Â£15,000, more than the House of Lords would have requested at the conclusion of their investigation. A refund of the difference was never issued by the House of Lords. The [[Metropolitan Police]] opened an investigation concerning these expense claims,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7017838.ece  "Three more peers face charges"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604200455/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7017838.ece |date=4 June 2011 }} ''The Sunday Times'' 7 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but by the end of February 2010 concluded there was no case.  Lord Paul appeared before various committees for Lord's Conduct with ultimately the Privileges Committee concluding that Lord Paul had not acted dishonestly or in bad faith.  They did determine however that he had been negligent and acted in ignorance and that his actions did render him liable to sanction by the House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Committee Office, House of Lords |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldprivi/37/3703.htm |title=House of Lords - The Conduct of Lord Paul - Privileges and Conduct Committee |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=21 September 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924150453/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldprivi/37/3703.htm |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Paul's suspension was for four months.  Lord Paul completely disagreed with their finding, calling it "unreasonable." Lord Paul gave a  [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110622-0003.htm#11062274000031&lt;nowiki/&gt; Speech] in the House of Lords in June 2011 calling for reform and revision of the structure of the constitution.

Paul tendered his resignation as Deputy Speaker to the Lord Speaker on 1 November 2010. His letter, printed in ''[[The House Magazine]]'' a week later, expressed his reservations about the process, calling it "a sad saga for parliamentary democracy â an unfortunate series of events having evidently been inspired by the electoral politics of the media". He has spoken on this topic many times since the expenses scandal initially made news,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/ColumnsOthers/A-trial-by-rumour/Article1-634780.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629091529/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/ColumnsOthers/A-trial-by-rumour/Article1-634780.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 June 2013 |title=A trial by rumour |publisher=Hindustantimes.com |date= |accessdate=21 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains that no wrongdoing had occurred in his case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Simon Hattenstone |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/11/mps-expenses-scandal-what-next |title=MPs' expenses scandal: what happened next? &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=21 September 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929141107/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/11/mps-expenses-scandal-what-next |archivedate=29 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newstatesman.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=McDonagh |first=Siobhain |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/mehdi-hasan/2010/03/160-status-lord-peer-tory |title=Exclusive: Lord Paul to end his non-domiciled tax status |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=9 March 2010 |accessdate=21 September 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114215037/http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/mehdi-hasan/2010/03/160-status-lord-peer-tory |archivedate=14 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technocracy''' is a proposed system of [[governance]] where decision-makers are selected on the basis of their expertise in their areas of responsibility, particularly scientific knowledge. This system explicitly contrasts with the notion that elected representatives should be the primary decision-makers in government,&lt;ref name="Berndt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/2023/SWP-1353-09057784.pdf|title=From Technocracy To Net Energy Analysis: Engineers, Economists And Recurring Energy Theories Of Value|last=Berndt|first=Ernst R.|year=1982|format=PDF|work=Studies in Energy and the American Economy, Discussion Paper No. 11, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Revised September 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it does not necessarily imply eliminating elected representatives. Leadership skills for decision-makers are selected on the basis of specialized knowledge and performance, rather than political affiliations or [[democracy|parliamentary skills]].&lt;ref name="BEW8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/Technocracy1943.pdf|title=Questioning of M. King Hubbert, Division of Supply and Resources, before the Board of Economic Warfare|date=1943-04-14|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-05-04}}p.35 (p.44 of PDF), p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''technocracy'' was originally used to advocate the application of the [[scientific method]] to solving social problems. Concern could be given to sustainability within the resource base, instead of monetary profitability, so as to ensure continued operation of all social-industrial functions. In its most extreme [[word sense|sense]] technocracy is an entire [[government]] run as a technical or engineering problem and is mostly [[hypothesis|hypothetical]]. In more practical use, technocracy is any portion of a [[bureaucracy]] that is run by [[Civic technologist|technologist]]s. A government in which elected officials appoint experts and professionals to administer individual government functions and recommend legislation can be considered technocratic.&lt;ref name="BBC2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="minds" /&gt; Some uses of the word refer to a form of [[meritocracy]], where the ablest are in charge, ostensibly without the influence of special interest groups.&lt;ref name="technocracy1"&gt;{{cite web | title=History and Purpose of Technocracy by Howard Scott | url=http://www.technocracy.org/Archives/History%20&amp;%20Purpose-r.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422182206/http://www.technocracy.org/Archives/History%20%26%20Purpose-r.htm | archivedate=22 April 2009 | publisher=Technocracy.org | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the term==
The term ''technocracy'' is derived from the Greek words ÏÎ­ÏÎ½Î·, ''tekhne'' meaning ''skill'' and ÎºÏÎ¬ÏÎ¿Ï, ''kratos'' meaning ''power'', as in ''governance'', or ''rule''. William Henry Smyth, a Californian engineer, is usually credited with inventing the word ''technocracy'' in 1919 to describe "the rule of the people made effective through the agency of their servants, the scientists and engineers", although the word had been used before on several occasions.&lt;ref name="technocracy1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technocracy.org/periodicals/nwtechnocrat/237/who-is-a-technocrat.html |title=Who Is A Technocrat?&amp;nbsp;â Wilton Ivie&amp;nbsp;â (1953) |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2001-03-11 |accessdate=2012-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230024203/http://www.technocracy.org/periodicals/nwtechnocrat/237/who-is-a-technocrat.html |archivedate=December 30, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=-TRc9kGle7U|title=Howard Scott Interviewed by Radcliff Student&amp;nbsp;â Origins of Technical Alliance &amp; Technocracy&amp;nbsp;â (1962)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]] (1995, fourth edition). ''Sleepers, Wake! Technology and the Future of Work'', Oxford University Press, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Smyth used the term ''Technocracy'' in his 1919 article "'Technocracy'âWays and Means to Gain Industrial Democracy," in the journal ''Industrial Management'' (57).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary 3rd edition (Word from 2nd edition 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Smyth's usage referred to [[Industrial democracy]]: a movement to integrate workers into decision making through existing firms or revolution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the 1930s, through the influence of [[Howard Scott]] and the [[technocracy movement]] he founded, the term technocracy came to mean, 'government by technical decision making', using an energy metric of value. Scott proposed that money be replaced by energy certificates denominated in units such as [[erg]]s or [[joules]], equivalent in total amount to an appropriate national [[net energy]] budget, and then distributed equally among the [[North America]]n population, according to resource availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/technocracy|title=Technocracy - Define Technocracy at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berndt"/&gt;

There is in common usage found the derivative term ''technocrat''. The word ''technocrat'' can refer to someone exercising governmental authority because of their knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Technocracy.aspx|title=Technocracy facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Technocracy|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "a member of a powerful technical elite", or "someone who advocates the supremacy of technical experts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/11/technocrats_and_the_european_debt_crisis_what_s_a_technocrat_.html |title= What's a Technocrat?|last1= Wickman|first1= Forrest|date= November 11, 2011|website= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher= The Slate Group|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2011"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15720438|title= Who, What, Why: What can technocrats achieve that politicians can't?|date= November 14, 2011|website= [[BBC News]]|publisher= BBC|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minds"&gt;{{cite news |title=Technocrats: Minds like machines|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21538698 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=19 November 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonnell and Valbruzzi define a prime minister or minister as a technocrat if âat the time of his/her appointment to government, he/she: has never held public office under the banner of a political party; is not a formal member of any party; and is said to possess recognized non-party political expertise which is directly relevant to the role occupied in governmentâ.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan McDonnell and Marco Valbruzzi (2014) "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.12054/abstract Defining and classifying technocrat-led and technocratic governments]", ''[[European Journal of Political Research]]'', Vol. 53, No. 4, pp. 654-671.&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, the [[President of Russia]] has often nominated ministers based on technical expertise from outside political circles, and these have been referred to as "technocrats".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ozy.com/provocateurs/life-after-putin-the-technocrats/78972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://intersectionproject.eu/article/politics/plight-russias-technocrats&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors==
Before the term ''technocracy'' was coined, technocratic or quasi-technocratic ideas involving governance by technical experts were promoted by various individuals, most notably early socialist theorists such as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]]. This was expressed by the belief in state ownership over the economy, with the function of the state being transformed from one of pure philosophical rule over men into a scientific administration of things and a direction of processes of production under scientific management.&lt;ref&gt;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, ''Saint Simon''; ''Socialism''&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Daniel Bell]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"St. Simon's vision of industrial society, a vision of pure technocracy, was a system of planning and rational order in which society would specify its needs and organize the factors of production to achieve them."&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bell |first1=Daniel |year=2008 |title=The Coming Of Post-industrial Society |origyear=1st. Pub. 1976 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6_56x5tB7gC&amp;pg=PA76 |accessdate=2014-11-02 |isbn=978-0465097135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Citing the ideas of St. Simon, Bell comes to the conclusion that the "administration of things" by rational judgement is the hallmark of technocracy.&lt;ref name="bell" /&gt;

[[Alexander Bogdanov]], a Russian scientist and social theorist, also anticipated a conception of technocratic process. Both Bogdanovâs fiction and his political writings, which were highly influential, suggest that he expected a coming revolution against capitalism to lead to a technocratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/apr07/page10.html|title=Bogdanov, technocracy and socialism|work=worldsocialism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1913 until 1922, Bogdanov immersed himself in the writing of a lengthy philosophical treatise of original ideas, ''Tectology: Universal Organization Science''. [[Tectology]] anticipated many basic ideas of [[systems analysis]], later explored by [[cybernetics]]. In ''Tectology'', Bogdanov proposed to unify all social, biological, and physical sciences by considering them as systems of relationships and by seeking the organizational principles that underlie all systems.

Arguably, the [[Plato]]nic idea of [[Plato's Republic|philosopher-kings]] represents a sort of technocracy in which the state is run by those with specialist knowledge, in this case, knowledge of the Good, rather than scientific knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The Platonic claim is that those who best understand goodness should be empowered to lead the state, as they would lead it toward the path of happiness. Whilst knowledge of the Good is different to knowledge of science, rulers are here appointed based on a certain grasp of technical skill, rather than democratic mandate.

==Characteristics==
Technocrats are individuals with technical training and occupations who perceive many important societal problems as being solvable, often while proposing technology-focused solutions. The administrative scientist Gunnar K. A. Njalsson theorizes that technocrats are primarily driven by their cognitive "problem-solution mindsets" and only in part by particular occupational group interests. Their activities and the increasing success of their ideas are thought to be a crucial factor behind the modern spread of technology and the largely ideological concept of the "[[information society]]". Technocrats may be distinguished from "[[Economist|econocrats]]" and "[[bureaucrat]]s" whose problem-solution mindsets differ from those of the technocrats.&lt;ref name="Njalsson"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Njalsson| first =Gunnar K.

The former government of the [[Soviet Union]] has been referred to as a technocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Loren R. ''The Ghost of the Executed Engineer: Technology and the Fall of the Soviet Union''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet leaders like [[Leonid Brezhnev]] often had a technical background in education; in 1986, 89% of Politburo members were engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several governments in European [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]] have been labeled 'technocratic' based on the participation of unelected experts ('technocrats') in prominent positions.&lt;ref name=BBC2011/&gt; Since the 1990s, Italy has had several such governments (in Italian, ''governo tecnico'') in times of economic or political crisis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gundle |first1=Stephen (ed.) |last2=Parker |first2=Simon (ed.) |year=1996 |title=The new Italian Republic: from the fall of the Berlin Wall to Berlusconi |publisher=Routledge |origyear=1st.

In the article "Technocrats: Minds Like Machines",&lt;ref name=minds/&gt; it is stated that Singapore is perhaps the best advertisement for technocracy: the political and expert components of the governing system there seem to have merged completely. This was underlined in a 1993 article in "Wired" by Sandy Sandfort,&lt;ref&gt;"The Intelligent Island", Wired 1.04, September/October 1993&lt;/ref&gt; where he describes the information technology system of the island even at that early date making it effectively intelligent.

===Engineering===
Following Samuel Haber,&lt;ref&gt;Haber, Samuel. ''Efficiency and Uplift'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Stabile argues that engineers were faced with a conflict between physical efficiency and [[cost efficiency]] in the new corporate capitalist enterprises of the late nineteenth century [[United States]]. The profit-conscious, non-technical managers of firms where the engineers work, because of their perceptions of market demand, often impose limits on the projects that engineers desire to undertake.

The prices of all inputs vary with market forces thereby upsetting the engineer's careful calculations. As a result, the engineer loses control over projects and must continually revise plans. To keep control over projects the engineer must attempt to exert control over these outside variables and transform them into constant factors.&lt;ref&gt;Stabile, Donald R. (1986). Veblen and the political economy of the engineer: The radical thinker and engineering leaders came to technocratic ideas at the same time. ''[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]], (45:1),'' 43â44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the Communist Party of China are mostly professional engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gigazine.net/gsc_news/en/20160301-chinese-engineering-american-law|title=Why do Chinese leaders have a degree in engineering and American leaders have degrees in law? |publisher=Gigazine|date=2016-03-01|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2018}} The Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China have enabled them to plan ahead in a technocratic fashion{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} to build projects such as the [[National Trunk Highway System]], the [[High-speed rail in China|China high-speed rail system]], and the [[Three Gorges Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.havenscenter.org/files/Red%20Engineers--excerpts.pdf|format=PDF|title=Rise of the Red Engineers|first=Joel|last=Andrews|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1995|accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technocracy movement==
{{main|Technocracy movement}}
The American economist and sociologist [[Thorstein Veblen]] was an early advocate of technocracy, and was involved in the [[Technical Alliance]] as was [[Howard Scott]] and [[M. King Hubbert]] (who later developed the theory of [[peak oil]]). Veblen believed that technological developments would eventually lead toward a socialistic organization of economic affairs. Veblen saw socialism as one intermediate phase in an ongoing evolutionary process in society that would be brought about by the natural decay of the business enterprise system and by the inventiveness of engineers.&lt;ref&gt;The life of Thorstein Veblen and perspectives on his thought,

[[Daniel Bell]] sees an affinity between Veblen and the [[Technocracy movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Bell, "Veblen and the New Class", ''American Scholar'', V. 32 (Autumn 1963) (cited in Rick Tilman, ''Thorstein Veblen and His Critics, 1891â1963'', Princeton University Press (1992))&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, [[Howard Scott]] and [[Marion King Hubbert]] founded [[Technocracy Incorporated]], and proposed that money be replaced by energy certificates. The group argued that apolitical, rational engineers should be vested with authority to guide an economy into a thermodynamically balanced load of production and consumption, thereby doing away with unemployment and [[debt]].&lt;ref name="Berndt"/&gt;

The technocracy movement was highly popular in the USA for a brief period in the early 1930s, during the [[Great Depression]]. By the mid-1930s, interest in the movement was declining. Some historians have attributed the decline of the technocracy movement to the rise of Roosevelt's [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;Beverly H. Burris (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=I-k0hgtaiCcC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=%22Continental+Committee%22+on+Technocracy+Inc.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KC-yu_Uu5g&amp;sig=9YefoXvlt-vqEiLUgrdMwFrxgA4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HwcCS-DPEMOUkAWmjrjwCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Continental%20Committee%22%20on%20Technocracy%20Inc.&amp;f=false Technocracy at work] State University of New York Press, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Fischer (1990). ''Technocracy and the Politics of Expertise'', Sage Publications, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian William E. Akin rejects the conclusion that technocracy ideas declined because of the attractiveness of Roosevelt and the New Deal. Instead Akin argues that the movement declined in the mid-1930s as a result of the technocrats' failure to devise a 'viable political theory for achieving change'.&lt;ref name="NelsonAkin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Daniel|last2=Akin|first2=William E.|title=Technocracy and the American Dream: The Technocrat Movement, 1900-1941|journal=Reviews in American History|date=March 1978|volume=6|issue=1|pages=104|doi=10.2307/2701484|jstor=2701484|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akin postulates that many technocrats remained
vocal and dissatisfied and often sympathetic to anti-New Deal third party efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hope.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/10/4/682 Book review: Technocracy and the American Dream], ''History of Political Economy'', Vol. 10, No. 4, 1978, p. 682.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2011}}In distribution and [[logistics]] of many types of products,  '''track and trace''' or tracking and tracing, concerns a process of determining the current and past locations (and other information) of a unique item or property.

This concept can be supported by means of reckoning and reporting of the position of vehicles and containers with the property of concern, stored, for example, in a [[Real time database|real-time database]]. This approach leaves the task to compose a coherent depiction of the subsequent status reports.

Another approach is to report the arrival or departure of the object and recording the identification of the object, the location where observed, the time, and the status. This approach leaves the task to verify the reports regarding consistency and completeness. An example of this method might be the package tracking provided by shippers, such as [[Deutsche Post]], [[United Parcel Service]], [[AirRoad]], or [[FedEx]].

== Technology ==
[[File:RFID_Chip_004.JPG|thumb|An example of a generic [[RFID]] chip.]]
[[File:Semacode-fr-wikipedia-org-wiki-pomme.png|thumb|Some produce traceability makers use matrix barcodes to record data on specific produce.]]

The international standards organization [[EPCglobal]] under [[GS1]] has ratified the EPC network standards (esp. the EPC information services [[EPCIS]] standard) which codify the syntax and semantics for supply chain events and the secure method for selectively sharing supply chain events with trading partners.  These standards for Tracking and Tracing have been used in successful deployments in many industries and there are now a wide range of products that are certified as being compatible with these standards.

In response to a growing number of recall incidents (food, pharmaceutical, toys, etc.), a wave of software, hardware, consulting and systems vendors have emerged over the last few years to offer a range of [[traceability]] solutions and tools for industry.
[[RFID|Radio-frequency identification]] and [[barcode]]s are two common technology methods used to deliver traceability.

RFID is synonymous with track-and-trace solutions, and has a critical role to play in supply chains. RFID is a code-carrying technology, and can be used in place of a barcode to enable non-line of sight-reading. Deployment of RFID was earlier inhibited by cost limitations but the usage is now increasing.

Barcoding is a common and cost-effective method used to implement traceability at both the item and case-level. Variable data in a barcode or a numeric or alphanumeric code format can be applied to the packaging or label. The secure data can be used as a pointer to traceability information and can also correlate with production data such as time to market and product quality.&lt;ref&gt;Traceability: Giving every product an authentic identity, Package Printing, June 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Packaging converters have a choice of three different classes of technology to print barcodes:
*[[Inkjet]] (dot on demand or continuous) systems are capable of printing high resolution (300 dpi or higher for dot on demand) images at press speed (up to 1000fpm). These solutions can be deployed either on-press or off-line. 
*[[Laser printer|Laser]] marking can be employed to ablate a coating or to cause a color change in certain materials. The advantage of laser is fine detail and high speed for character printing, and no consumables. Not all substrates accept a laser mark, and certain colors (e.g. red) are not suitable for barcode reading.
*Thermal transfer and direct thermal. For lower speed off-press applications, thermal transfer and direct thermal printers are ideal for printing variable data on labels.

Consumers can access web sites to trace the origins of their purchased products or to find the status of shipments.  Consumers can type a code found on an item into a search box at the tracing website and view information. This can also be done via a smartphone taking a picture of a 2D barcode and thereby opening up a website that verifies the product (i.e. product authentication).

The '''United Nations Disarmament Commission (UNDC)''' is a [[United Nations]] commission under the [[United Nations General Assembly]] which primarily deals with issues relating to [[Disarmament]].

==History==
The United Nations Disarmament Commission was first established on 11 January 1952 by [[United Nations General Assembly]] Resolution 502 (VI). This  commission was put under the jurisdiction of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and its mandate included: preparing proposals for a treaty for the regulation, limitation and balanced reduction of all armed forces and all armaments, including the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/067/57/IMG/NR006757.pdf?OpenElement|title=Resolutions Adopted on the reports of the First Committee|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=May 22, 2018|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, this commission only met a few times, and was followed by a succession of other disarmament-focused bodies: the [[Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee]] (1960), the [[Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament]] (1962), the [[Conference of the Committee on Disarmament]] (1969) and, finally, the [[Conference on Disarmament]] (1979), which still meets to this day. &lt;ref name=BACKGROUND&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/institutions/disarmament-commission/|title=United Nations Disarmament Commission|publisher=United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs|website=United Nations|access-date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second iteration of the commission was formed on 30 June 1978 by the General Assembly as a subsidiary organ of the Assembly. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/S-10/2|title=Resolution Adopted on the Report of the ''Ad Hoc'' Committee of the Tenth Special Session|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=May 22, 2018|}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commissions includes all members states of the United Nations and meets yearly in New York for approximately three weeks. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/Depts/ddar/discomm/undc.html|title=The United Nations Disarmament Commission (UNDC)|publisher=United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs|website=United Nations|access-date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a deliberative body, whose mandate is considering and making recommendations on various issues in the field of disarmament. &lt;ref name=BACKGROUND&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that disarmament is a substantial topic, the UNDC has traditionally focused on a limited number of agenda items at each session, typically three or four. In 1998, this tendency was made official by the General assembly, who through decision 52/492, limited the work of the UNDC to "two agenda items per year from the whole range of disarmament issues, including one on nuclear disarmament." Additionally, each topic is considered in the UNDC for a three-year period. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://undocs.org/A/INF/52/4/Add.1|title=Resolutions and Decisions Adopted by the General Assembly During Its Fifty-Second Session|publisher=United Nations |website=United Nations|access-date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each session, working groups are created, the number of which is dependent on the number of agenda items being discussed by the body.

'''Women in Iceland''' generally enjoy good gender equality. As of 2018, 88% of working-age women are employed, 65% of students attending university are female, and 41% of members of [[Althing|parliament]] are women. Nevertheless, women still earn about 14% less than men.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38214736|title=Iceland: Top for equality but still 'needs to do more'|date=7 December 2016|website=BBC News|last1=Smith|first1=Colletta}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iceland]] has the world's highest proportion of women in the labour market, significant child care allocations for working women, and three months' parental leave for both men and women.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/history/iceland-women%E2%80%99s-strike-1975|title=The Iceland women's strike, 1975|website=libcom.org|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland is arguably one of the world's most feminist countries, having been awarded this status in 2011 for the second year in a row.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2015/economies/#economy=ISL|title=Economies|website=Global Gender Gap Report 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland was the first country to have a female president, [[VigdÃ­s FinnbogadÃ³ttir]], elected in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.forseti.is/FormerPresidents/VigdisFinnbogadottir|title=VigdÃ­s FinnbogadÃ³ttir|website=english.forseti.is|author=Disill}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has the world's first female and openly gay head of government, [[JÃ³hanna SigurÃ°ardÃ³ttir]], who was elected prime minister in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johanna-Sigurdardottir|title=Johanna Sigurdardottir {{!}} prime minister of Iceland|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland enjoys the smallest overall gender gap, according to the [[World Economic Forum]] ranking [[Global Gender Gap Report]], a position it has held since 2008. In 2016 Iceland had a 12.6% gap, as measured across four categories: health, education, economic participation and opportunity, and political advancement.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/10/31/iceland-us-women-in-parliament-congress/|title=The Tiny Nation of Iceland Is Crushing the U.S. in Electing Female Politicians|date=2016-10-31|website=Fortune|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pay gap between women and men is decreasing at a rate which would lead to parity in 2068.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women earn about 72% of men's salaries on average, and are still subject to domestic and sexual violence.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Women's suffrage ===
[[File:Women right to vote 1915 celebration Iceland.jpg|thumb|Icelanders celebrating women's suffrage in 1915.]]
Icelandic women first got the right to vote in parliamentary elections in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World suffrage timeline - Women and the vote {{!}} NZHistory, New Zealand history online |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/womens-suffrage/world-suffrage-timeline |website=nzhistory.govt.nz |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845 the vote was limited to men above a certain age who owned property and paid taxes. These restrictions were lifted over time, and in 1903 all men could vote except farm labourers.&lt;ref name="styrk"&gt;{{cite web |last1=StyrkÃ¡rsdÃ³ttir |first1=AuÃ°ur |title=KvennasÃ¶gusafn Ãslands - Women's suffrage in Iceland |url=https://kvennasogusafn.is/index.php?page=womens-suffrage |website=kvennasogusafn.is |publisher=Director of the Womenâs History Archives, Iceland from 2001-2016 |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=is}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 the right to vote in municipal elections was extended to all women, having been granted to widows and single women of independent means in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jonasson |first1=Stefan |title=100 years of womenâs suffrage in Iceland |url=https://www.lh-inc.ca/icelandic-paper/online-stories/548-stefan-jonasson |website=www.lh-inc.ca |publisher=LÃ¶gberg-Heimskringla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill for women's suffrage was agreed on by the Althing in 1911, ratified by the Althing in 1913, and enacted on 19 June 1915 by the Danish king but only granted the vote to women over 40, and did not grant the right to vote to servants.&lt;ref name="styrk" /&gt; At the time this was around 12,000 Icelandic women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Elliott |first1=AlÃ«x |title=Iceland Celebrates 100 Years of Womenâs Suffrage |url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2015/06/19/iceland-celebrates-100-years-womens-suffrage |website=Iceland Review |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=en |date=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 these restrictions were lifted after Iceland became an independent state under the Danish crown in 1918.&lt;ref name="styrk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Benjamin |first1=GabrÃ­el |title=Icelanders Celebrate The 100 Year Anniversary Of Womenâs Suffrage - The Reykjavik Grapevine |url=https://grapevine.is/culture/2015/03/06/icelanders-celebrate-the-100-year-anniversary-of-womens-suffrage/ |website=The Reykjavik Grapevine |accessdate=19 October 2018 |date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1975 women's strike ===
{{main|1975 Icelandic women's strike}}

It is said that in 1975, women in the workplace made 60% less than their male counterparts. Many were unable to work as they had to stay at home to do the housework and raise the children.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/icelandic-women-strike-economic-and-social-equality-1975|title=Icelandic women strike for economic and social equality, 1975 {{!}} Global Nonviolent Action Database|website=nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday, October 24, women left their formal and informal work at 14:05 (2:05p.m.), the time at which they would have earned their day's wage had they been paid at the same average rate as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://observers.france24.com/en/20161025-iceland-women-protest-wage-gap |title=Icelandic women cut working day to protest wage gap |publisher=France24 |date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of the event was very large, involving 25,000 women in a country with just 220,000 inhabitants. In [[Reykjavik]], almost 90% of the women participated.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;.

The first strike in 1975 affected many things. Many schoolteachers were women, so schools closed or nearly so. The walkout disrupted the telephone service, and halted the printing of newspapers, as the [[typesetter]]s were all women. Daycares were mostly closed, because the daycare workers were women, so men had to take their children to work. Easy-to-cook meals ran out in many stores, as did sweets and items to distract children.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34602822|title=The day Iceland's women went on strike|last=Brewer|first=Kirstie|date=2015-10-23|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike continued until midnight, when women returned to work. The typesetters returned to set newspapers which were almost entirely devoted to the womens' strike.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

Woman achieved their intended goal, basically shutting down Iceland for the day.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Men referred to this day as "the Long Friday".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[VigdÃ­s FinnbogadÃ³ttir|VigdÃ­s]] says she would not have become president without the strike which she said was the "first step for women's emancipation in Iceland", which "completely paralysed the country and opened the eyes of many men".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In the year following the strike, Iceland set up the [[Gender Equality Council]], and passed the [[Gender Equality Act (Iceland)|Gender Equality Act]], which prohibited gender discrimination in the workplace and in schools.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== 21st century ===

The strike was repeated; in 1975, 2005, 2010, and 2016 women in Iceland walked out in accordance to the time of day that they would stop being paid if their wage was the same as men.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; On October 24, 2016 women left work at 2:38pm, for the 41st anniversary of the original [[1975 Icelandic women's strike|women's day off]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/10/25/iceland-women-leave-work-238pm-protest-gender-wage-gap|title=In Iceland, Women Leave Work at 2:38pm to Protest Gender Wage Gap|newspaper=Common Dreams|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicated that women have gained only a half an hour more in pay in 11 years, that is slightly less than three minutes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kvenrettindafelag.is/useful-resources/icelandic-women-on-strike/|title=Icelandic Women on Strike {{!}} KvenrÃ©ttindafÃ©lag Ãslands|date=2016-11-07|newspaper=KvenrÃ©ttindafÃ©lag Ãslands|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Women's Strike]], a global version inspired by the Icelandic strike, spread in 2017 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0261-3077| last = James| first = Selma| title = Decades after Icelandâs âday offâ, our womenâs strike is stronger than ever {{!}} Selma James| work = The Guardian| accessdate = 3 September 2018| date = 8 March 2018| url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/iceland-global-womens-strike-protest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = CNN| first = Judith Vonberg and Laura Perez Maestro| title = 'If women stop, the world stops:' Women down tools for 'feminist strike'| work = CNN| accessdate = 3 September 2018| url = https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/08/europe/global-womens-strike-international-womens-day-intl/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and employment==

45.5% of the Icelandic formal workforce was women in 2010. In the 2000s, just under 80% of Icelandic women were in [[formal employment]], the highest rate in the [[OECD]] (about 86% of men were in formal employment).&lt;ref&gt;OECD data, percentage, year: 77.4 (2000) 77.3 (2001) 76.7 (2002) 78.3 (2003) 76.3 (2004) 77.8 (2005) 78.5 (2006) 78.6 (2007) 77.7 (2008) 77.1 (2009) 77.6 (2010) [https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=54741 OECD Stats.

In 2008, 65% of women working were doing so full-time, compared to 90% of men.&lt;ref name=equality_info&gt;{{cite report|title=Gender equality in Iceland: Information on Gender Equality Issues in Iceland |date=February  2012 |publisher=JafnrÃ©ttisstofa (Centre for Gender Equality Iceland) |url=https://www.jafnretti.is/?lang=en |language=en}} (also available [https://www.jafnretti.is/?lang=en in Icelandic]).&lt;/ref&gt; 

14% of Icelandic families have [[single parent|single mothers]], while 2% have [[single parent|single fathers]]. 40% have both parents, while the remainder of families are childless.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; Among those not in formal employment, a 2010 survey found that 95%&lt;!--1800 women and 100 men--&gt; of those describing themselves as homemakers were women. The survey also found 1200 people on unpaid family leave, all of them women.&lt;ref name=equality_info/&gt; 

In 1987 Icelandic fathers were given the right to share some of the mother's six month family entitlement.&lt;ref name="haas"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haas |first1=Linda |last2=Rostgaard |first2=Tine |title=Fathers' rights to paid parental leave in the Nordic countries: consequences for the gendered division of leave |journal=Community, Work &amp; Family |date=May 2011 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=177â195 |doi=10.1080/13668803.2011.571398 |accessdate=10 November 2018 |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13668803.2011.571398}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was enacted due to the passing of similar laws in Norway and Sweden.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt; In 2000, Iceland passed a law for a [[father's quota]]; three months of paid leave were reserved for the father, three for the mother, and the remaining three could be used by either parent.&lt;ref name="haas" /&gt; This was enacted in stages, with the amount of leave increased each year, being fully implemented in 2003.&lt;ref name="haas" /&gt;

After the law was brought in, more than 90% of fathers used their paternal leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gunn |first1=Dwyer |title=Icelandâs âDaddy Leaveâ Shows a New Path Forward |url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/04/paternity-leave-in-iceland-helps-mom-succeed-at-work-and-dad-succeed-at-home.html |website=Slate Magazine |accessdate=10 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research found that this put men and women on a more equal footing in the workplace, but did not seem to affect the pay gap.&lt;ref name=equality_info/&gt; In 2012, there were plans to gradually increase the leave to be five months for each parent, plus two months of transferrable leave, by 2016.&lt;ref name=recession/&gt;

The Icelandic labour market is strongly gender-segregated, with substantial differences in gender ratios in different sectors.&lt;ref name=recession&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thorsdottir |first1=Thora Kristin |title=Iceland: From feminist governance to gender-blind austerity? |journal=Gender, Sexuality &amp; Feminism |date=January 2015 |volume=1 |issue=2 |doi=10.3998/gsf.12220332.0001.203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Iceland are more likely to get university degrees than men, up to the PhD level. They made up forty percent of tertiary graduates in science, mathematics and computing, and 35% of graduates in engineering, manufacturing, and construction, in 2012/2013. Over 80% of health graduates, and over 70% of veterinary, agricultural, and education graduates, are women. Less than a quarter of those working as plant and machine operators and in crafts and trades, agriculture, fisheries, and management are women&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; (although, against this trend, 60% of managers in the [[civil society]] sector are women&lt;ref name=equality_info/&gt;). Women are more likely to work in the public sector, men in the private sector, which means women's employment is not as strongly affected by economic fluctuations.&lt;ref name=recession/&gt; Women are less likely to get trade and vocational qualifications. Journalists are slightly less likely to be women than men, but less than one in three interviewees in news programs is a woman.&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite web |title=Women and Men in Iceland 2018 |url=https://www.statice.is/media/51003/women_and_men_2018_net.pdf |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[2008â2011 Icelandic financial crisis]], there was a swing towards female leadership. Women had been all but absent from pre-crisis banking boards; after the crisis, they were appointed to the new boards, and two-thirds of the bank managers appointed after nationalization were female. Women were also more successful in running for political office, with the proportion of women in parliament rising to a record 43%.&lt;ref name=recession/&gt;

== Government ==
Iceland became the third modern democratic country in which women gained the vote in 1915. However, by 1975, there were only three parlimentarians (5% of all parliamentarians), and there had only been nine female parlimentarians in total. Other [[Nordic countries]] had 16%-23%. After the [[1975 Icelandic women's strike]], more women were elected. In 2015, 28 parlimentarians (44%) were female.&lt;ref name=1975_strike&gt;{{Cite news| last = Brewer| first = Kirstie| title = The day Iceland's women went on strike| work = BBC News| accessdate = 2018-09-04| date = 2015-10-23| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34602822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Agudath Israel''' ({{lang-he-n|×××××ª ××©×¨××}}), usually known as the '''Aguda,''' was established in the early twentieth century as the political arm of Ashkenazi [[Torah Judaism]]. It succeeded ''Agudas Shlumei Emunei Yisroel'' (Union of Faithful Jewry) in 1912.&lt;ref name=HarJ&gt;{{cite web |title=Haredi Judaism 
|url=http://religion-faith-belief.blogspot.com/2013/02/haredi-judaism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its base of support was located in [[Eastern Europe]] before the [[Second World War]] but, due to the revival of the [[Hasidic]] movement, it included Orthodox Jews throughout Europe.

== History ==
World Agudath Israel was established by Jewish religious leaders at a conference held at [[Kattowitz]] (Katowice) in 1912.&lt;ref name=HarJ/&gt; They were concerned that the Tenth [[World Zionist Congress]] had defeated a motion by the Torah Nationalists [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement for funding religious schools. The aim of World Agudath Israel was to strengthen Orthodox institutions independent of the Zionist movement and Mizrachi organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Aguddah.html|title=The "Aguddat Israel" Movement|author=|date=|website=www.ucalgary.ca|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the First World War delayed development of the organisation, however.

During the First World War, Rabbi Dr. [[Pinchas Kohn]] and Rabbi Dr. Emmanuel Carlebach (both from Germany),&lt;ref name=FVIOJ.co&gt;"The legal publishers of this new daily were the German rabbis Pinchas Kohn and Emmanuel Carlebach of the FVIOJ..."{{cite book

In this position, they worked closely&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stevens-tech.edu/golem/llevine/rsrh/carlebach/german_rabbi_goes_east.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with the Grand Rabbi of Ger, Rabbi [[Avraham Mordechai Alter]]. As a result of this collaboration, they formed Agudath Israel, whose aim was to unify Eastern European and Western European [[Orthodox Judaism]].

Agudath Israel gained a significant following, particularly among Hasidic Jews. It had representatives running in the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] elections after the First World War, and they won seats in that country's [[parliament]] ([[Sejm]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Agudath Israel...

|title=Agudas Yisroel  |url=http://www.YIVOencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Agudas_Yisroel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the elected representatives were [[Alexander Zusia Friedman]], Rabbi [[Meir Shapiro]], Rabbi Yosef Nechemya Kornitzer of [[KrakÃ³w]], and Rabbi Aharon Lewin of [[RzeszÃ³w|Reysha]]. 

Prominent Torah scholars who led Agudath Yisroel included the [[Avrohom Mordechai Alter|Gerrer Rebbe]], the [[Izhbitza (Hasidic dynasty)|Radziner Rebbe, Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Elazar Leiner]], and the [[Yisrael Meir Kagan|Chafetz Chaim]]. In [[Latvia]] between 1922-1934, members of the Agudath Israel faction, led by [[Mordehai Dubin|Mordechai Dubin]], were elected to [[Saeima]] (The Parliament). Another prominent member of Agudath Israel was [[Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl|Michoel Ber Weissmandl]].

In the United Kingdom, the Agudath Israel movement was represented by the [[Adath Israel Synagogue]], formed in 1909, and the [[Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations]], formed in 1926. By 1943 Agudath Israel represented approximately 5000 families and was led by Rabbi Dr [[Solomon Schonfeld]]. The British secretary of the Agudath Israel World Organization, the political wing of the movement, was [[Harry Goodman]], publisher and editor of ''[[Jewish Weekly]].'' He played a key part in maintaining the Agudath Israel organization through World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Shatzkes (2002) ''Holocaust and Rescue: Impotent or Indifferent? Anglo-Jewry 1938-1945'' Basingstoke: Palgrave, pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to World War II and the [[Holocaust]], Agudath Israel operated a number of Jewish educational institutions throughout Europe. After the war, it has continued to operate such institutions in the United States as [[Agudath Israel of America]], and in Israel. Agudath Israel is guided by its [[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]] (Council of Sages) in Israel and the USA.

In the post-War period, Agudath Israel reached a [[modus vivendi]] with the State of Israel, which was predominantly led by secularists. It helped secure an agreement  between Ashkenazi Rabbinical leaders and [[David Ben-Gurion]] which ensured Ashkenazi rabbinical co-ordination with the state, as well as the implementation of such guarantees as public observance consistent with the laws of the [[Shomer Shabbat|Sabbath]] and ''[[Kashrut]]''. It has established itself as an Israeli political party winning seats in the [[Knesset]] either as the [[Agudat Israel]] or in coalition with other Orthodox groups running under the name [[United Torah Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;"... list made up of the ultra-Orthodox parties Agudat Israel and Degel HaTorah ... United Torah Judaism (UTJ) promotes the interests of the Haredi community ..." {{cite web |title=United Torah Judaism - The Israel Democracy Institute
|url=https://en.idi.org.il/israeli-elections-and-parties/parties/united-torah-judaism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Agudath Israel Federation holds international conferences and Torah congressional meetings known as a ''Knessia Gedola''.
