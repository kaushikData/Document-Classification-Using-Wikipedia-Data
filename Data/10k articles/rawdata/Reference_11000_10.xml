==History==
The At-Turi cemetery of the Al-Araqeeb Bedouin dates back to 1914. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Israel began to displace the Bedouin of the Negev desert, and by 1953 had expelled 90% of the roughly 100,000 people in the northern Negev. According to [[Eyal Weizman]], various methods, from strafing to massacres and tent burning were employed, and the refugees moved to Gaza and the West Bank. The survivors were swept into a more salinated area, into a reservation, known as ''Siyāj.'' The Bedouin who came from Al-Araqib ("Gentle Hills"), such as the al-Tūris and al-‘Uqbis have nonetheless persisted in returning to their ancestral lands, and their village lies precisely on the 200mm RPA (rainfall per annum) drawn by Israeli meteorologists on the basis of a schema developed by [[Wladimir Köppen]] to define cultivable land from the desert. Two archives have been established to document the local Bedouins rights to their land, one by Nūri al-‘Uqbi and another by Israeli geographer [[Oren Yiftachel]]. Israeli courts have so far rejected suits to reclaim this land, refusing, according to Weizman, to acknowledge Bedouin tenure south of the 200&amp;nbsp;mm line, which is reserved for kibbutzim and moshavim.&lt;ref&gt;George Prochnik with [[Eyal Weizman]], [https://lareviewofbooks.org/interview/the-desert-threshold 'The Desert Threshold,'] ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'' 18 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 an Israeli court turned down a suit by the al-'Uqbis to have their title, based on a claim of continuous cultivation, recognized by the state.&lt;ref name=AraqimJP&gt;Joanna Paraszczuk and Sharon Udasin, [http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=262501 'Court rejects 6 Beduin Negev land lawsuits,'] [[Jerusalem Post]] 19 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jewish National Fund]] planned to include the land of Al-Araqeeb in a new forestation project in the [[Negev Desert]] called ''Ambassadors' Forest'', honoring the assistance provided to Israel by the world's diplomatic corps. This plan spurred objection from some Bedouin living in [[Rahat]] and several villages nearby. In July 2010 the village was demolished by 1,300 police officers, acting under orders of the [[Israel Land Administration]].&lt;ref name="police destroy"&gt;{{cite web

After a six-year-long court case, in a [[Precedent|precedent-setting]] ruling on March 15, 2012, the Beersheba District court ruled against the six [[lawsuit]]s brought by Al-Uqbi family, which claimed their private [[ownership]] of land in the Al-Araqeeb area.&lt;ref name="JPost"&gt;Jerusalem Post, "Court rejects 6 Beduin Negev land lawsuits", March 19, 2012. [http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?ID=262501&amp;R=R1]&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon the experts' testimony and the presented evidence, the [[judge]] ruled that this land belongs to the [[Sovereign state|State]]. The court ruling was left disregarded - the Bedouin came back to the place 59 times to rebuild the structures, but each time they were razed back by the state.&lt;ref name="Levy Levac" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt; Aziz al-Touri, a representative of the village has asked why Jews are permitted to move to the Negev and live in [[kibbutzim]], [[moshavim]] and isolated farms while that right is denied the Bedouin desiring to dwell in their own villages. The interviewers comment that the 1948 Palestinian exodus never ended.&lt;ref name="Levy Levac" /&gt;

==Land ownership==

The Bedouin families of Arakib say they own about 4,600 acres of the [[Negev]] desert,&lt;ref name="LA Times 2010-07-28"/&gt; and that they paid property taxes to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandatory authorities in Palestine]].&lt;ref name="LA Times 2010-07-28"&gt;{{cite news

Israeli officials say the property was taken over by the state in the early 1950s because it was abandoned, and because its inhabitants were unable to produce [[deed]]s.&lt;ref name="LA Times 2010-07-28"/&gt; They maintained that the Bedouins have been squatters who refused to pay rent; they [[Tillage|cultivated land]] that did not belong to them, and were [[animal domestication|raising animals]] without [[livestock permit]]s.&lt;ref name="LA Times 2010-07-28"/&gt; Authorities claim that there has never been a permanent Bedouin settlement in the area. The Ottoman authorities permitted the [[clan]] members to graze their sheep and cows on this land, but did not give them ownership over it.

According to the [[Israel Lands Administration]] (ILA), Bedouins began illegally settling in the area in 1998, and several dozen families built homes in the area in 1999 when it appeared the government was attempting to seize the land.&lt;ref name="LA Times 2010-07-28"/&gt; The ILA offered to rent the land for 2 [[New Israeli shekel|NIS]] per [[dunam]], but the inhabitants refused to pay and "continued to infiltrate the land year after year."&lt;ref name="police destroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost /&gt; In 2000, an Israeli court order banned the Bedouins from entering the area. The ruling was disregarded, as Bedouins continued to move into the area and plant trees. In 2003, the ILA secured a court order to evacuate the residents, and the case went to the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="police destroy"/&gt; 
In 2004, though one resident speaks of crop dusters poisoning the fields in the later 1990s,&lt;ref name="Levy Levac" /&gt; the [[Israel Land Administration]] used [[crop duster]] [[fumigation]] to destroy the residents' [[wheat]] crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In July 2011 the state filed a NIS 1.8 million suit against 34 Bedouins from the Abu Mediam and Abu Jabber families, whom they accuse of illegal encroachment on state lands. The suit seeks to reclaim the state costs of evicting families from the Negev village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=231200 State sues Beduin of al-Arakib village for NIS 1.8m]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the following months, residents continued to return to the village and build makeshift structures.

On January 16, 2011, Israeli security forces demolished eleven makeshift buildings. Protesters clashed with police, who responded with pepper spray and paintball guns. Five protesters were injured. Taleb el-Sana attended and told Israeli media that, "The state is pushing its Bedouin citizens to the point where they may launch a popular intifada, which will have severe results."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4014380,00.html Ilana Curiel, "Bedouin village razed again; residents: Fascist state"], Ynet.

==Court findings==
[[File:AlAraqeeb 2007.JPG|thumb|250px|Aerial shot of Al-Araqeeb in 2007 presented by the state in court]]
In late 2006, seventeen Bedouin of the al-Uqbi family filed six land claims saying that the land they are on, including Al-Araqeeb, belongs to them. After five years of legal proceedings, the court heard extensive testimonies of experts and witnesses on the behalf of both sides, reviewed historical documents, and scrutinized land laws from the Ottoman period, the British mandate period and that of Israel. The country's leading experts in historical and political geography testified. For the plaintiffs spoke [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev|Ben Gurion University]]’s Prof. [[Oren Yiftachel]], a [[Critical geography|critical geographer]] and a social scientist. Testifying for the state was Prof. [[Ruth Kark]], a leading expert on the [[historical geography]] of Palestine and Israel from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]].&lt;ref name=JPost/&gt;

The plaintiffs argued that the state order to expropriate the land in 1951 was made on the erroneous assumption that under Ottoman law, the land was classified as ''Mawat'' (uncultivated and not adjacent to settled lands). They said that the land had been cultivated and owned by them, and so classified as ''Miri'' land under Ottoman legal terms. In an expert opinion filed to the court, Oren Yiftachel said that these “tribal areas” of scattered tent clusters were not at that time registered with the authorities, but were nevertheless considered settled and met the definition of a “village” in the 1921 Land Ordinance.&lt;ref name=JPost/&gt;

The state’s expert witness, Prof. Ruth Kark,  said that prior to 1858 there had been no fixed settlements on or near the disputed land. The first permanent settlement had been Beersheba, which the Ottomans founded in 1900 and which is 11 kilometers from Al-Araqeeb – refuting the Beduin’s claims that the land could not have been Mawat because it was both cultivated and next to a settlement.&lt;ref name=JPost/&gt; The State presented an aerial shot of the place which they said proved that the Al-Araqeeb area had no cultivated land during the British mandate period.&lt;ref name="IToday"&gt;Nadav Shragai, "The True Story of Al-Araqeeb", March 19, 2012.

The verdict was presented by Judge Sarah Dovrat in the Beersheba District court on March 15, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://old.justice.gov.il/MOJHeb/HeskeminVeKishreiHutz/Heskemim/Pirsumim/shonot |title=Civil Case File Nos. 7161/06, 7275/06, 7276/06 1114/07, 1115/07, 5278/08, Suleiman Mahmud Salaam El-Uqbi (deceased) et. al. v.

The judge said that the Bedouin knew they were supposed to register but did not. She said, "The state said that although the complainants are not entitled to compensation, it has been willing to negotiate with them," and that "it is a shame that these negotiations did not reach any agreement." The court also ordered the Bedouin to pay legal costs of 50,000 NIS (approximately U.S. $13,500).&lt;ref name=JPost/&gt;

In its ruling, the court criticized the expert on the behalf of the plaintiffs, stating that his testimony lacked a sufficient factual basis value and reliable basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://old.justice.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/0FA805C1-9BCC-4FB0-8F1E-47CC9E869EC5/37796/ElUqbiEniglishfinal.pdf |title=Full text of court judgement |access-date=2012-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230550/http://old.justice.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/0FA805C1-9BCC-4FB0-8F1E-47CC9E869EC5/37796/ElUqbiEniglishfinal.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the court held that the Bedouins' own internal documentation indicates they were well aware of the legal requirement to register the lands in the Land Registry, but chose not to do so.&lt;ref name=JPost/&gt; The judge affirmed that the practice of removal of encroached settlements carried out by the State is acceptable and legal.&lt;ref name=JPost/&gt;

His research has focused mainly on [[fossil]] reptiles from the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geologic time)|Period]], including extinct [[Dinosaur|dinosaurs]] and [[Crocodylomorpha|crocodylomorphs]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.org.br/resultado.php3?codigo=kellner|title=Membros|last=|first=|date=|website=Academia Brasileira de Ciências|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123143247/http://www.abc.org.br/resultado.php3?codigo=kellner|archive-date=2010-11-23|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kellner has over 500 publications to his name, has published more than 160 primary studies and two science books. He has participated in paleontological expeditions to many locations including Brazil, Chile, Iran, the United States, Argentina, China, and Antarctica. 

His scientific achievements include the description of more than thirty [[species]]. For his work he has received several honors and prizes, including the [[TWAS Prize]] for Earth Sciences from the [[The World Academy of Sciences]] and admission to the [[National Order of Scientific Merit]] (class Comendador), one Brazil's most prestigious awards.

==Biography==
Kellner was born in [[Vaduz]], [[Liechtenstein]], son of a German father and Austrian mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://www.terra.com.br/istoegente/57/reportagem/rep_cacador.htm|titulo=O caçador de dinossauros|data=|acessodata=2018-11-24|publicado=ISTOÉ Gente Online|ultimo=Cohen|primeiro=Vivianne}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early childhood he moved with his parents to Brazil, where he became naturalised Brazilian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[Rio de Janeiro]] he received a [[Primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] at the bilingual [[Deutsche Schule Rio de Janeiro|Escola Alemã Corcovado]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He began studying [[geology]] at the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] (UFRJ) in 1981. As a student, he soon began researching [[fossil]] [[Vertebrate|vertebrates]], particularly [[Reptile|reptiles]] from Brazil's [[Cretaceous]] [[Geological period|Period]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His studies focused largely on [[pterosaur]] specimens from the geologic [[Santana Group]], about which he published many papers in the late 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} He earned a [[Master of Science]] degree in geology at the UFRJ in 1991, a [[M.Phil]] degree in 1994, and a [[Ph.D.]] in 1996 from [[Columbia University]] in New York, in a joint program with the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. In 1997 he became a professor at the Federal University-owned [[National Museum of Rio de Janeiro]] and [[curator]] of its geological and [[paleontological]] departments. From 1998 to 2001, he served as the chairman of these departments and has been head of the [[zoology]] graduate program since 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kellner is also chief editor of the ''[[Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciências]]'', the official publication of the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/revistas/aabc/iedboard.htm|title=An. Acad. Bras. Ciênc. - Editorial board|website=www.scielo.br|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander_Kellner_at_the_Academia_Brasileira_de_Sciencias.png|thumb|left|upright=0.60|Kellner speaking at the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], in August 2014]]

As part of his work on flying reptiles, Kellner organised the [[Pterosaur Workshop]] at Pittsburgh, USA, in 1995,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twas.org/sites/default/files/kellner_cv_2015_twas.pdf|title=Curriculum Vitae (condensed)|last=Kellner|first=A.

As well, he was involved in the organisation of several scientific meetings in Rio de Janeiro such as the 31st International Geological Congress in 2000 and the 2nd Latin-American Congress of Vertebrate Paleontology in 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kellner has organized or taken part in several paleontological expeditions to many locations around the globe, including Brazil—[[Mato Grosso]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Ceará]];&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lattes.cnpq.br/0424535851535945|title=Curriculo do Sistema de Curriculos Lattes (Alexander Wilhelm Armin Kellner)|date=2018|website=National Council for Scientific and Technological Development|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the deserts of [[Atacama]], Chile and [[Kerman]], Iran; [[Montana]] in the United States; [[Patagonia]] in Argentina;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the famous deposits of [[Liaoning]], China,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/09/12/world/science-health-world/ancient-flying-dragon-reptile-named-avatar-creature/|title=Ancient flying ‘dragon reptile’ named after ‘Avatar’ creature|date=2014-09-12|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Ross Island]] in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/08/110824-sea-monster-antarctica-plesiosaur-science-animals/|title=Oldest Antarctic 'Sea Monster' Found|last=Valle|first=Sabrina|date=2011|work=National Geographic|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/scienceandhealth/2016/03/1755522-brazilian-paleontologists-face-43-days-camping-in-freezing-temperatures-and-return-with-three-tons-of-fossils-from-antarctica.shtml|title=Brazilian Paleontologists Face 43 Days Camping in Freezing Temperatures and Return with Three Tons of Fossils from Antarctica|last=Leite|first=Marcelo|date=2016|website=UOL|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kellner has over 500 publications to his name (including abstracts and science articles). He has published more than 160 primary studies&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and two science books: ''Pterossauros - os senhores do céu do Brasil'' ("Pterosaurs — Lords of the Brazilian Sky")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pterossauros - os senhores do céu do Brasil.|last=Kellner|first=A.

As a result of his scientific activity he has received several honours, being appointed a member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences in 1997. He is also an honourable member of the [[New York Paleontologial Society]] and the [[Paleontological Society of Chile]]. He is a research associate of the American Museum of Natural History&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and of the Chinese [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Besides his teaching activity, having advised over fifteen master and Ph.D. students, Kellner has been active in the propagation of scientific knowledge to the general public. He organised the 1999 exposition ''No Tempo dos Dinossauros'' ("In the Time of the Dinosaurs") at the [[Museum of Earth Sciences]], which has been regarded as a landmark for the establishment of paleontology in Brazil, attracting the attention of the people of Brazilian to the studies of fossils.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2006 he organized the mounting of the first large-scale dinosaur skeleton in Brazil, that of the [[sauropod]] ''[[Maxakalisaurus]] topai'', for which he received recognition from the [[Brazilian Congress]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/world/super-maxakalisaurus-from-the-old-cretaceous-20060830-ge311n.html|title=Super maxakalisaurus, from the old Cretaceous|last=Villaverde|first=Julio|date=2006-08-30|website=The Age|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026104146/https://www.theage.com.au/world/super-maxakalisaurus-from-the-old-cretaceous-20060830-ge311n.html|archive-date=2018-10-26|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004 he has written a monthly column in ''Caçadores de Fósseis'' (Fossil Hunters), on the website ''Ciência Hoje On Line'', a project of the [[Brazilian Society for Scientific Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cienciahoje.org.br/coluna_category/cacadores-de-fosseis/|title=Caçadores de Fósseis|work=Ciência Hoje|access-date=2018-10-26|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from studying their fossils, Kellner has performed important theoretical work on pterosaurs, including [[cladistic]] studies regarding their [[phylogeny]]. In this he is the founder of a distinctive Brazilian school of the study of pterosaurs, with its own favoured phylogenetic model, clade terminology and nomenclature. Rivalling models and nomenclatural choices have been provided by the influential British pterosaur researcher [[David Unwin]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

For his achievements he has received several honours and prizes, including the [[TWAS Prize]] for Earth Sciences from the [[The World Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Prizes and Awards"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://twas.org/article/twas-announces-2010-prize-winners |title=Prizes and Awards |date=2016 |publisher=The World Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted in the [[National Order of Scientific Merit]](class Comendador), one the Brazilian Federal Government's most prestigious awards.

==List of species named by Kellner==
Kellner's scientific achievements include the description of more than thirty [[species]], of which ''[[Santanaraptor]]'' ''placidus'' (1996, 1999) is among the best examples of soft tissue preservation, including blood vessels and muscle fibers, reported in any [[dinosaur]]. The pterosaur ''[[Thalassodromeus]] sethi'', which Kellner described in 2002 with his colleague Diogenes de Almeida Campos, allowed for the establishment of a new hypothesis regarding the use of the head crest in body temperature regulation of pterosaurs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A complete list of new species described and named by Kellner, sometimes in cooperation with other researchers, includes:

A full atlas is generally regarded as a definitive work on distribution, whereas a provisional atlas is typically produced as an interim stage to show survey progress.

One of the bodies responsible for publishing a great number of distribution atlases is the '''Institute of Terrestrial Ecology'''. Each atlas presents 10&amp;nbsp;km² distribution maps for the species within its scope. Maps typically use different symbols to signify records from differing time-periods - solid symbols for 10-km squares (hectads) that have recent records, and unfilled symbols for 10-km squares for which only older records exist, according to a defined cut-off date.

The atlases are produced by the [[Biological Records Centre]] (BRC), which is run by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, part of the [[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]] based at [[CEH Wallingford]], [[Crowmarsh Gifford]], [[Oxfordshire]]. The data used to produce the maps is gathered by volunteer biological recorders and collated by the [[BRC Recording Schemes]].

The atlases fall into two groups:

* '''Main Atlases''' are commercially published books, presenting the current state of knowledge for well-recorded groups. They typically include text information about the species, and other supporting material such as analyses of trends. They are usually produced only where a well-established recording scheme has been in operation for a significant period of time, and the scheme organisers believe that the data represent a comprehensive picture of the distribution of each species.
* '''Provisional Atlases''' give recorders an indication of progress and illustrate early results. Some of the later ones are quite detailed and less "provisional" - for example the Hoverfly Atlas, which provides charts of flight-period as well as text, and the Atlas of Aquatic Bugs, which has biological information and identification aids for some of the animals.

A bill of sale is a document that transfers ownership of goods from one person to another. It is used in situations where the former owner transfers possession of the goods to a new owner. Bills of sale may be used in a wide variety of transactions: people can sell their goods, exchange them, give them as gifts or mortgage them to get a loan. They can only be used:
* to transfer ownership of goods that people already own;
* to transfer ownership of moveable tangible goods; and
* by individuals and unincorporated businesses.
Bills of sale exist at [[common law]] quite independently of any legislation. In England and Wales, they are regulated by two Victorian pieces of legislation: the Bills of Sale Act 1878 and the Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882. This area of the law was subject to review by the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]], which published a proposal for change in 2017.&lt;ref name=lawcom-20171123&gt;{{cite report |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/662596/PRINT_-_From_Bills_of_Sale_to_Goods_Mortgages.pdf |title=From Bills of Sale to Goods Mortgages |isbn=978-1-5286-0110-8 |publisher=House of Commons |work=Law Commission |id=HC 495/Law Com No 376 |date=23 November 2017 |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bills of sale in the US ==

===Historical origin===
The term “bill of sale” originally referred to any writing by which an absolute disposition of personalty for value was effected or evidenced. A common feature of such dispositions is that the owner mortgagor remains in possession and exercises all the attendant rights of ownership, which may be so overwhelming as to induce a third party to accept the same chattel as a security for a grant, albeit without notice of the first mortgagee. This scenario made the bill of sale a veritable tool of fraud.

The evolution of various bills of sale laws, within the USA, was to curb the use of the bill of sale as a means of defrauding innocent persons. The first of such being the [[Bills of Sale Act 1854]] which was repealed and re-enacted by the [[Bills of Sale Act 1878]] which was almost on all fours with the 1854 act. Further developments led to the enactment of the [[Bills of Sale Act 1882]].

A bill of sale has been defined as a legal document made by the seller to a purchaser, reporting that on a specific date at a specific locality and for a particular sum of money or other value received, the seller sold to the purchaser a specific item of personal property, or parcel of real property of which he had lawful possession . The Black’s Law Dictionary  on its part defines a bill of sale as “an instrument for the conveyance of title to personal property, absolutely or by way of security”. According to Omotola the bill of sale is “a form of legal mortgage of chattels”. Bullen and Leake and Jacobs define a bill of sale as “a document transferring a proprietary interest in personal chattels from one individual (the “grantor”) to another (the “grantee”), without possession being delivered to the grantee”.

In essence, a bill of sale is a written instrument showing the voluntary transfer of a right or interest or title to personal property, either by way of security or absolutely, from one person to another without the actual physical possession of the property leaving the owner and being delivered to the other party. It is clear from the definitions above that the bills of sale are essentially of two types: The absolute bill of sale and the conditional bill of sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.documatica-forms.com/usa/bill-of-sale/more-info.php |title=What is a USA Bill of Sale or Documented Sales Receipt? |deadurl=no |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The absolute bill of sale===
Absolute bills of sale, which do not represent any form of security whatsoever, are simply documents evidencing assignments, transfers and other assurances of personal chattels, which are substantially no more than mere [[contract of sale|contracts of sale]] of goods covered by the common law of contract and the sale of goods law.

===The conditional bill of sale===
The conditional bill of sale refers to any assignment or transfer of personal chattels to a person by way of security for the payment of money.  The conditional bill of sale creates a security in favour of the grantee of the bill whereby the grantee is given personal right of seizure giving right to a security interest of a possessory nature.

There are other forms of security over goods such as a pledge and contractual lien which also only give right to a security interest of a possessory nature.

An example of a conditional bill of sale can be found where a creditor gives a loan and has transferred to himself, as collateral or security for the loan, the title of the goods or other personal property of the debtor. The physical goods or other property however remains with the debtor.

== Bills of sale in England and Wales ==

=== Historical perspective ===
Bills of sale have existed at common law since at least the [[Middle Ages]], when they were most commonly used commercially in the shipping industry. As the general population began to own more personal goods in the [[Victorian era]], bills of sale came to be used as a form of consumer credit. Lenders would extend credit on the security of:&lt;blockquote&gt;''all and every the household goods, furniture, plate, linen, china, books, stock in trade, brewing utensils and all the effects.''&lt;ref&gt;J Weir, "The Law of Bills of Sale" (1896) p.23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Most often, people would grant bills of sale over their goods as security for a loan. Borrowers would transfer ownership of their goods to the lender, while retaining possession of them when making repayments. When the loan was repaid, the borrower would regain ownership. Bills of sale used in this way are known as “security bills”.

Sometimes, bills of sale would transfer ownership outright, such as when a person sold their goods to another while retaining possession. Bills of sale used for purposes other than borrowing money are known as “absolute bills”.

=== Bills of Sale Acts ===
The increased use of bills of sale in the Victorian era created a “false wealth” problem. Potential purchasers and other lenders could be misled into thinking that the person in possession of goods still owned them. The person in possession could sell the goods or use them to secure another loan. In both cases, the transaction was fraudulent, but the purchaser or lender had no way of discovering that the goods were already subject to a bill of sale.

As a result, Parliament passed the Bills of Sale Act 1878. This largely replicated the provisions of an earlier Bills of Sale Act 1854. It requires all bills of sale to be registered at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] so that interested third parties could check whether the person in possession has already transferred away ownership of goods.&lt;ref name=lawcom-20171123/&gt;

The Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882 had a different purpose. The 1878 Act led to a rise in the use of security bills. Concerns were expressed that such transactions could lead “thousands of honest and respectable people to their ruin”.&lt;ref name=hansard-1882&gt;Hansard (HC), 20 March 1882, vol 267, cc1398-416.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament noted that:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Many money-lenders advertised under the names of fictitious banks; and sometimes they advertised in this form – “A widow, with capital to spare, will be happy to lend on easy terms. Strict secrecy. Five per cent.”… Having entrapped a man into his office, the money-lender proceeded in this way – He produced a bill of sale containing a large number of clauses, which it was impossible for the borrower to read or understand in the time allowed...&lt;ref name=hansard-1882/&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;In response, Parliament enacted the 1882 Act, which was an early attempt at consumer protection.

Both the 1878 Act and the 1882 Act remain in force today. Absolute bills are regulated only by the 1878 Act. Security bills are regulated by the 1882 Act and the 1878 Act, to the extent that its provisions are consistent with those of the 1882 Act.

=== Bills of sale in the 21st century ===
In the twenty-first century, bills of sale are overwhelmingly used in the form of so-called “[[Logbook loan|logbook loans]]”.&lt;ref name=lawcom-2015&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/app/uploads/2015/09/cp225_bills_of_sale.pdf |title=Bills of Sale - A Consultation Paper |id=Consultation Paper No 225 |publisher=Law Commission |year=2015 |isbn=9780108561702 |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} These are security bills secured on the borrower’s vehicle. Borrowers transfer ownership of their car, van or motorcycle to the logbook lender as security for the loan. While making repayments, borrowers keep possession of their vehicle and continue to use it. Borrowers hand the logbook lender the V5C registration document – or “logbook” – but this is purely symbolic and has no legal effect.

=== Criticism and reform of the law ===
The law of bills of sale has been criticised on a number of occasions. The Crowther report in 1971&lt;ref&gt;Report of the committee on consumer credit (1971) Cmnd 4596.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Diamond report in 1986&lt;ref&gt;A Diamond, ''A review of security interests in property'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; both considered the Acts, with the latter recommending repeal. 

In its consultation paper, the Law Commission made a number of criticisms of the law as it stood in 2015. It proposed to replace the Bills of Sale Acts with a new Goods Mortgages Act.&lt;ref name=lawcom-2015/&gt;{{rp|71}}

In its consultation paper, the Law Commission identified five key problems with the Bills of Sale Acts:
* undue complexity;
* highly technical documentation;
* the registration regime is in need of modernisation;
* they offer little protection to borrowers;
* they offer no protection to third party purchasers.&lt;ref name=lawcom-2015/&gt;{{rp|7}}
The Law Commission proposed to replace the Bills of Sale Acts with a new Goods Mortgage Act that would address each of the criticisms identified in the consultation paper.&lt;ref name=lawcom-20171123/&gt;

" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buildings of the United States|url=http://uiuc.libguides.com/content.php?pid=317714&amp;sid=2646525|work=Library Guide: Basic Architectural Sources|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books in the series are intended as a resource for academics, architects, and preservationists, as well as guidebooks for the general public.  Each volume is intended to be written by an individual expert or contributing experts. The series is sponsored by the [[Society of Architectural Historians]], having established its editorial board, consisting of academics and representatives of the [[National Park Service]], the [[Library of Congress]], and the [[American Institute of Architects]].  As of 2012, the head of the editorial committee is Professor Emerita at [[Tulane University]], Karen Kingsley, Editor-in-Chief and Managing Editor.  The Society also coordinates fundraising for the project.

The series is a planned 60-volume work. Work on the series was inspired by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]'s ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of England]]'' guidebooks.  The Society has overseen the publication of 25 volumes since 1993.&lt;ref name=Published&gt;{{cite web|title=Published Volumes|url=https://www.sah.org/publications-and-research/buildings-of-the-us/published-and-forthcoming-volumes|publisher=Society of Architectural Historians|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series first 10 volumes were published by [[Oxford University Press]] and since 2006, it has been published by the [[University of Virginia Press]].&lt;ref name=Buildings&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first four volumes (1993) on buildings in Alaska, the District of Columbia, Iowa, and Michigan (2nd ed. 2012) received American publishing awards, and its volumes on Colorado (1997) and Louisiana (2004) have also received honors.

'''Chavacano''' or '''Chabacano''' {{IPA-es|tʃaβaˈkano|}} refers to a number of [[Spanish-based creole languages|Spanish-based creole language]] varieties spoken in the [[Philippines]]. The variety spoken in Zamboanga City, located in the southern Philippine island group of Mindanao, has the highest concentration of speakers. Other currently existing varieties are found in Cavite City and Ternate, located in the Cavite province on the island of Luzon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/cbk|title=Chavacano|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavacano is the only Spanish-based [[Creole language|creole]] in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zamboanga.com/history/history_chabacano_versus_related_creoles.htm|title=The Early History of Chavacano de Zamboanga: Chabacano versus related creoles|website=www.zamboanga.com|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The different varieties of Chavacano differ in certain aspects like vocabulary but they are generally [[mutually intelligible]] by speakers of these varieties, especially between neighboring varieties. While a majority of the lexicon of the different Chavacano varieties derive from Spanish, their grammatical structures are generally similar to other [[Philippine languages]]. Among [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]], it is the only one that is not an [[Austronesian language]], but like [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]], it uses [[reduplication]].

The word ''{{wiktes|chabacano|Chabacano}}'' is derived from Spanish, roughly meaning "poor taste" or "vulgar", though the term itself carries no negative connotations to contemporary speakers and has lost its original Spanish meaning.

== Distribution and variants ==

===Varieties===
[[Image:Map chavacano.gif|thumb|right|190px|Native Zamboangueño speakers in Mindanao.]]

Linguists have identified at least six Spanish Creole varieties in the Philippines. Their classification is based on their [[substratum|substrate languages]] and the regions where they are commonly spoken. The three known varieties of Chavacano with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] as their substrate language are the [[Luzon]]-based creoles of which are '''Caviteño''' (spoken in [[Cavite City]]), '''Bahra''' or '''Ternateño''' (spoken in [[Ternate, Cavite]]) and '''Ermiteño''' (once spoken in the old district of [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]] in [[Manila]] and is now extinct).

There exists a number of theories on how these different varieties of Chavacano have evolved and how they are related to one another. According to some linguists, Zamboangueño Chavacano is believed to have emanated from Caviteño Chavacano as evidenced by prominent [[Zamboangueño]] families who descended from Spanish Army officers (from [[Spain]] and [[Latin America]]), primarily Caviteño mestizos, stationed at [[Fort Pilar]] in the 19th century. When Caviteño officers recruited workers and technicians from [[Iloilo]] to man their [[sugar]] plantations and [[rice]] fields to reduce the local population's dependence on the Donativo de Zamboanga, taxes levied by the Spanish colonial government on the islanders to support the fort's operations. With the subsequent migration of Ilonggo traders to Zamboanga, the Zamboangueño Chavacano was infused with Ilonggo words as the previous migrant community was assimilated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205215037/http://www.zamboanga.org/chavacano/chabacano_by_ben_saavedra.htm|title=Mensajes Y Noticias|date=2005-02-05|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of what appears to be [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] words in Zamboangueño Chavacano are actually Ilonggo. Although Zamboangueño Chavacano's contact with Cebuano began much earlier when Cebuano soldiers were stationed at Fort Pilar during the Spanish colonial period, it was not until closer to the middle of the 20th century that borrowings from Cebuano accelerated from more migration from the Visayas as well as the current migration from other Visayan-speaking areas of the Zamboanga Peninsula.

'''Zamboangueño''' (Chavacano) is spoken in [[Zamboanga City]], [[Basilan]], parts of [[Sulu]] and [[Tawi-Tawi]], and [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]] and [[Zamboanga del Norte]]. Zamboangueño Chavacano is the most dynamically spoken language of Philippine Creole Spanish. It is used as a lingua franca between both Muslim and Christians in the Southwestern Mindanao and Basilan Islands communities. Its influence has spread to other islands in the west, such as the Jolo Islands, as well as to cotabato and davao in mindanao, and finally down south to Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-06-01|title=The Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages and the Society for Pidgin and Creole Linguistics, In Retrospect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/jpcl.20.1.09gil|journal=Creole Language in Creole Literatures|volume=20|issue=1|pages=167–174|doi=10.1075/jpcl.20.1.09gil|issn=0920-9034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other varieties of Chavacano with [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] as their primary substrate language are the [[Mindanao]]-based creoles of which are '''Castellano Abakay''' or '''Chavacano de Davao''' (spoken in some areas of [[Davao City|Davao]]), influenced by [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and divided into two subdalects, ''Castellano Abakay Chino'' and ''Castellano Abakay Japón'', and '''Cotabateño''' (spoken in [[Cotabato City]]). Both Cotabateño and Davaoeño are very similar to Zamboangueño.

===Characteristics===
The Chavacano languages in the Philippines are creoles based on [[Mexican Spanish]] and possibly, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. In some Chavacano languages, most words are common with [[Andalusian Spanish]], but there are many words borrowed from [[Nahuatl]], a language native to Central Mexico, which are not to be found in Andalusian Spanish. Although the vocabulary is largely Mexican, its grammar is mostly based on other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]], primarily [[Hiligaynon language|Ilonggo]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]. By way of Spanish, its vocabulary also has influences from the Native American languages [[Nahuatl]], [[Taino]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], etc. as can be evidenced by the words chongo (monkey, instead of Spanish '{{wiktspa|mono}}'), tiange (mini markets), etc.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In contrast with the Luzon-based dialects, the Zamboangueño variety has the most borrowings and/or influence from other Philippine [[Austronesian languages]] including [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. Words of [[Malay language|Malay]] origin are present in Zamboangueño variety; the latter is included because although not local in Philippines, it was the lingua franca of [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. As Zamboangueño variety is also spoken by Muslims, the variety has some [[Arabic language|Arabic]] loanwords, most commonly [[Glossary of Islam|Islamic terms]].{{specify|date=February 2018}}{{dubious|date=February 2018}} Nevertheless, it is difficult to trace whether these words have their origin in the local population or in Spanish itself, given that Spanish has about 6,000 words of Arabic origin. Chavacano also contains loanwords of [[Persian language|Persian]] origin which enter Chavacano via Malay and Arabic; both Persian and Spanish are [[Indo-European languages]].

===Demographics===
The highest number of Chavacano speakers are found in '''[[Zamboanga City]]''' and in the island province of [[Basilan]]. A significant number of Chavacano speakers are found in Cavite City and Ternate. There are also speakers in some areas in the provinces of [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]], Davao, and in Cotabato City. According to the official 2000 Philippine census, there were altogether 607,200 Chavacano speakers in the Philippines in that same year. The exact figure could be higher as the 2000 population of Zamboanga City, whose main language is Chavacano, far exceeded that census figure. Also, the figure does not include Chavacano speakers of the [[Overseas Filipino|Filipino diaspora]]. Notwithstanding, Zamboangueño is the variety with the most number of speakers, being the official language of Zamboanga City whose population is now believed to be over a million; is also an official language in Basilan.

Chavacano speakers are possibly found elsewhere in Sabah as Sabah was under partial Spanish sovereignty and via Filipino refugees who escaped from [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] and predominantly Muslim areas of Mindanao like [[Sulu Archipelago]].

A small number of Zamboanga's indigenous peoples and of Basilan, such as the [[Tausūg people|Tausug]]s, the [[Samal people|Samals]], and the [[Yakan]]s, majority of those people are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], also speak the language. In the close provinces of Sulu and [[Tawi-Tawi]] areas, there are Muslim speakers of the ''Chavacano de Zamboanga'', all of them are neighbors of Christians. Speakers of the ''Chavacano de Zamboanga'', both Christians and Muslims, also live in [[Lanao del Norte]] and [[Lanao del Sur]]. Christians and Muslims in [[Maguindanao]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Cotabato]], [[South Cotabato]], [[Cotabato City]], and [[Saranggani]] speak ''Chavacano de Zamboanga'', while some of those living in [[Davao Region]] speak ''Chavacano de Davao''. Take note that [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-tawi, [[Maguindanao]], [[Cotabato City]], [[Soccsksargen]] (region that composed of [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Cotabato]], [[South Cotabato]], and [[Saranggani]]) and Davao Region became part of short-lived [[Republic of Zamboanga]], which chose Chavacano as [[official language]].

===Social significance===
Chavacano has been primarily and practically a spoken language. In the past, its use in literature was limited and chiefly local to the geographical location where the particular variety of the language was spoken. Its use as a spoken language far exceeds its use in literary work in comparison to the use of Spanish in the Philippines which was more successful as a written language than a spoken language. In recent years, there have been efforts to encourage the use of Chavacano as a written language, but the attempts were mostly minor attempts in folklore and religious literature and few pieces of written materials by the print media. In Zamboanga City, while the language is used by the mass media, the Catholic Church, education, and the local government, there have been few literary work written in Zamboangueño and access to these resources by the general public is not readily available. As Chavacano is spoken by Muslims as second language not only in Zamboanga City and Basilan but even in Sulu and Tawi-tawi, a number of [[Qur'an]] books are published in Chavacano.

While the Mindanao-based creoles, Castellano Abakay, and Cotabateño are believed to be in danger of extinction, the Zamboangueño variety has been constantly evolving especially during half of the past century until the present. Zamboangueño has been experiencing an infusion of English and more Tagalog words and from other languages worldwide in its vocabulary and there have been debates and discussions among older Chavacano speakers, new generation of Chavacano speakers, scholars, linguists, sociologists, historians, and educators regarding its preservation, cultivation, standardisation, and its future as a Spanish-based creole. In 2000, The [[Instituto Cervantes]] in Manila hosted a conference entitled "Shedding Light on the Chavacano Language" at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. Starting school year 2012–13, the Zamboangueño variant has also been taught at schools following the implementation of the Department of Education's policy of Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE). It serves as a medium of instruction from kindergarten to grade 3 and as a separate subject (Mother Tongue) from grades 1 to 3.

Because of the grammatical structures, Castilian usage, and archaic Spanish words and phrases that Chavacano (especially Zamboangueño) uses, between speakers of both contemporary Spanish and Chavacano who are uninitiated, both languages appear to be non-intelligible to a large extent. For the initiated speakers, Chavacano can be intelligible to some Spanish speakers, and while most Spanish words can easily be understood by Chavacano speakers, many would struggle to understand a complete Spanish sentence.

==Terminology==
The term '''Chavacano''' or '''Chabacano''' originated from the Spanish word ''{{wiktspa|chabacano}}'' which literally means "poor taste", "vulgar", "common", "of low quality", or "coarse". Chavacano has since evolved into a word of its own in different spellings with no negative connotation, but to simply being the name of the language itself.

During the Spanish colonial period, what is today called ''Chavacano'' was also called by the Spanish-speaking population as the "''lenguaje de la calle''", "''lenguaje de parian''" (language of the street), or "''lenguaje de cocina''" (kitchen Spanish) to refer to the Chabacano spoken by the people of Manila, particularly in Ermita) to distinguish it from the Spanish language spoken by those of the upper class, which consisted of Spaniards and educated Natives.

Linguists use the term '''Philippine Creole Spanish''' which can be further divided into two geographic classifications: Manila Bay Creoles (which includes Ternateño and Caviteño) and Mindanao Creole (including Zamboangueño). The varieties of the language are geographically related. The Manila Bay Creoles have Tagalog as their substrate language while The Mindanao Creoles have [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] (mostly [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Tausug language|Tausug]], and [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]), [[Subanon language|Subanon]], and [[Sama language|Sama]] as their substrate language(s). 

Chavacano/Chabacano speakers themselves have different preferences on whether to spell the language with a V or a B.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233632814|title=Noun phrases in Creole languages : a multi-faceted approach|date=2007|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|others=Baptista, Marlyse., Guéron, Jacqueline.|isbn=9789027291820|location=Amsterdam|oclc=233632814}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasize the difference between their variety and others using their own geographical location as a point of reference. Language speakers in Ternate also use the term Bahra to refer to their language and their city. Chavacano varieties usually have their area name attached to the language.

==Historical background==

There is no definite conclusion on the precise history of how these different varieties of Chavacaano developed.

Prior to the formation of what is today the Philippines, what existed were a collection of various islands and different [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnolinguistic group]]s inhabiting them. The [[Spanish Colonization of the Philippines|Spanish colonization]] of the Philippine islands had lead to the presence of the Spanish language in the islands. Though Spanish was the language of the government, the various languages originating and found in the islands remained the mother tongue of the various inhabitants. Instead of using Spanish to spread Christianity, Spanish missionaries preferred to learn the various local languages. With over 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, the Spanish language came to influence the various Philippine languages to varying degrees by way of aspects like new loanwords and expressions.

Creole languages (such as [[French-based creole]]s) have formed at various points in time around the world due to colonialism. As a result of contact between speakers of two mutually non-intelligible languages, creole languages have evolved in some cases to facilitate communication. This usually involves taking the vocubalury of another language and grammatical features of the native language. In contrast to the numerous French-based creole languages, only three creole languages have been found to be Spanish-based or heavily influenced: [[Papiamento]], [[Palenquero]], and Chavacano. In the Philippines, a major difficulty in tracing the development of Chabacano is the confusion attributed to in accounts of travelers to the Philippines between a coherent creole language, `broken Spanish', and fluent Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Lipski, J. M. Chabacano/Spanish and the Philippine linguistic identity.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest believed attestation of a coherent creole language spoken in Cavite City comes from the Augustinian priest Martínez de Zúñiga who in his 1803 accounts of his travels in the Philippines, ''Estadismos de las Islas Filipinas'', notes that "In Cavite and in its suburb of San Roque, a very corrupted Spanish is spoken, whose phraseology is entirely taken from the language of the country".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mentions of a vernacular referred to as "kitchen Spanish" and "language of the market" (referring to the Manila variety), or other terms are found in a number of texts of the 19th century. However, the kind of vernacular referred to by these terms are imprecise and these terms may refer to a fully fledged creole or to a Spanish-pidgin spoken by Chinese and Filipino merchants.

The manner of formation of this type of speech found in a number of communities around the Philippines remains unclear today. A sample of what is today called ''Chabacano'' may be found in dialogues contained in chapters 18 (''Supercherías'') and 28 (''Tatakut'') of Filipino writer [[José Rizal]]'s 1891 work ''[[El Filibusterismo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;text reproduced by [https://filipinoscribbles.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/chabacano-in-el-filibusterismo/ Filipino Scribbles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/art2/roger_santos/rizal.html&lt;/ref&gt; The dialogue found in chapter 18 is:

{{quote|''¿Porque ba no di podí nisós entrá?'' preguntaba una voz de mujer.

―''Abá, ñora, porque ‘tallá el maná prailes y el maná empleau'', contestó un hombre; ''‘ta jasí solo para ilós el cabesa de espinge''.

―''¡Curioso también el maná prailes!'' dijo la voz de mujer alejándose; ''¡no quiere pa que di sabé nisos cuando ilos ta sali ingañau! ¡Cosa! ¡Querida be de praile el cabesa!''}}

In the 1883 work of German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]] ''Uber das Malaiospanische der Philippinen'', he presents fragments of texts and comments of what he calls "Malayo-Spanish". However, the first to give a general study and investigation of the varieties of Chavacano as a group was by Keith Whinnom in his 1956 work ''The Spanish Contact Vernaculars in the Philippine Islands ''. Whinnom gives an overall view of the history and grammar of what he calls "Ermitaño" of Ermita in Manila, "Caviteño" of Cavite and "Zamboangueño" of Zamboanga. In it, he also postulated his [[Monogenetic theory of pidgins|monogenetic theory]] on the origin of these vernaculars.

Linguists are unsettled on how these vernaculars formed and how they connect to one another, if any. There are many theories but the two main theories of the origin of Chavacano are: Whinnom's "monogenetic theory" and a "parallel-development" theory proposed by Frake in 1971.

===Monogenetic theory===
{{expand section|date=February 2018}}
According to the Monogentic theory or one-way theory advanced by Whinnom, all varieties of Chavacano result from a single source and that varieties are related to each other.

===Parallel-development theory===
{{expand section|date=February 2018}}
The parallel development theory or two-way theory as advocated by Frake in 1971, the variants found in Luzon and Mindanao had evolved autonomously from each other.

===Zamboangueño===

On 23 June 1635, [[Zamboanga City]] became a permanent foothold of the Spanish government with the construction of the [[Fort Pilar|San José Fortress]]. Bombardment and harassment from pirates and raiders of the sultans of [[Mindanao]] and [[Jolo]] and the determination to spread Christianity further south (as Zamboanga was a crucial strategic location) of the Philippines forced the Spanish missionary friars to request reinforcements from the colonial government.

The military authorities decided to import labor from Luzon and the Visayas. Thus, the construction workforce eventually consisted of Spanish, Mexican and Peruvian soldiers, masons from Cavite (who comprised the majority), sacadas from Cebu and Iloilo, and those from the various local tribes of Zamboanga like the Samals and Subanons.

Language differences made it difficult for one ethnic group to communicate with another. To add to this, work instructions were issued in Spanish. The majority of the workers were unschooled and therefore did not understand Spanish but needed to communicate with each other and the Spaniards. A [[pidgin]] developed and became a full-fledged [[creole language]] still in use today as a [[lingua franca]] and/or as [[official language]], mainly in [[Zamboanga City]].

When the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] gave up its territories in [[Sulu Archipelago]] to Spain within late 1700s (Sulu Sultanate gave up Basilan to Spain in 1762, while Sulu and Tawi-tawi were not given up by sultanate because the Sulu Sultanate only recognized partial Spanish sovereignty to Sulu and Tawi-tawi), Spanish settlers and soldiers brought the language to the region until Spain, [[Germany]], and [[United Kingdom]] signed an agreement named the [[Madrid Protocol of 1885]] that recognized Spanish rule of Sulu Archipelago. Chavacano becomes a lingua franca of Sulu Archipelago (composing of Sulu, Tawi-tawi, Basilan); although North Borneo (now Sabah) is not included on the [[Spanish East Indies]] area as stated on the Protocol and control by the [[United Kingdom]], Chavacano has still a little impact in Semporna.

From then on, constant Spanish military reinforcements as well as increased presence of Spanish religious and educational institutions have fostered the Spanish creole.

===Caviteño / Ternateño{{anchor|Caviteño}}===
The [[Merdicas]] (also spelled Mardicas or Mardikas) were [[Catholic]] natives of the islands of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] of the [[Moluccas]], converted during the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] occupation of the islands by [[Jesuit]] missionaries. The islands were later captured by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] who vied for their control with the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]]. In 1663, the Spanish garrison in Ternate were forced to pull out to defend [[Manila]] against an impending invasion by the Chinese pirate [[Koxinga]] (sacrificing the Moluccas to the Dutch in doing so). A number of Merdicas volunteered to help, eventually being resettled in a sandbar near the mouth of the [[Maragondon]] river (known as the ''Barra de Maragondon'') and [[Tanza, Cavite]], Manila.&lt;ref name="lipski"&gt;{{cite book|author=John. M. Lipski, with P. Mühlhaüsler and F. Duthin|editor =Stephen Adolphe Wurm &amp; Peter Mühlhäusler|title =Atlas of Languages of Intercultural Communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas: Texts, Volume 2|chapter =Spanish in the Pacific|publisher =Walter de Gruyter|year =1996|page=276|isbn =9783110134179|url =http://www.personal.psu.edu/jml34/pacific.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invasion did not occur as Koxinga fell ill and died. The Merdicas community eventually integrated into the local population. Today, the place is called [[Ternate, Cavite|Ternate]] after the island of Ternate in the Moluccas, and the descendants of the Merdicas continue to use their Spanish creole (with Portuguese influence) which came to be known as Caviteño or Ternateño Chavacano.&lt;ref name="lipski"/&gt;

The following is sample of Ermitaño taken from the April 1917 publication of ''The Philippine Review'', the poem was written by the Filipino Spanish-language writer [[Jesús Balmori]] (who also wrote other texts in Ermitaño)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Balmori|first1=Jesús|title=Poema ermitense: El que ta pensá ele; Quilaya bos; Por causa del sirena|journal=The Philippine review (Revista filipina)|date=May 1917|volume=II|issue=5|pages=26|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/acp0898.0002.001/437}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is entitled "Na Maldito Arena":&lt;ref name="1917 Revista"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ta sumí el sol na fondo del mar, y el mar, callao el boca. Ta jugá con su mana marejadas com'un muchacha nerviosa con su mana pulseras.

According to Keith Whinnom's "Spanish contact vernaculars in the Philippine Islands" (1956), there were reportedly still an estimated 12,000 speakers in 1942 of Ermitaño. After World War II, much of Manila was destroyed and its citizens displaced. This variety is considered to be virtually extinct.

===Caviteño / Ternateño===

;Nisós ya pidí pabor cun su papang.
:Spanish: Nosotros ya pedimos un favor de tu padre.
:(We have already asked your father for a favor.)
:Ternateño follows pronominal system of three different pronouns, including subjects, objects and possession. The system follows the same pattern as Spanish, including both singular and plural conjugations based on what the speaker is explaining. For example ''yo (Spanish singular) becomes bo (Ternateño),'' whereas nosotros (Spanish plural) becomes mihótro (''Ternateño).'' Additionally Ternateño incorporates alternate language forms for different participles to denote the relationship with the individual being the speaker as well as the listener. This includes polite as well as casual foundation of speech, for example yo (casual) versus (éle).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/300482807|title=Roots of Creole structures : weighing the contribution of substrates and superstrates|date=2008|publisher=John Benjamins|others=Michaelis, Susanne.|isbn=9789027289964|location=Amsterdam|oclc=300482807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==

===Forms and style===

Chavacano (especially Zamboangueño) has two [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] or [[sociolect]]s: The common, colloquial, vulgar or familiar and the formal register/sociolects. Broadly speaking, the formal register is closer to Spanish, and the colloquial register to the local Austronesian languages.

In the common, colloquial, vulgar or familiar register/sociolect, words of local origin or a mixture of local and Spanish words predominate. The common or familiar register is used ordinarily when conversing with people of equal or lower status in society. It is also used more commonly in the family, with friends and acquaintances. Its use is of general acceptance and usage.

In the formal register/sociolect, words of Spanish origin or Spanish words predominate. The formal register is used especially when conversing with people of higher status in society. It is also used when conversing with elders (especially in the family and with older relatives) and those in authority. It is more commonly used by older generations, by Zamboangueño mestizos, and in the barrios. It is the form used in speeches, education, media, and writing. The formal register used in conversation is sometimes mixed with some degree of colloquial register.

The following examples show a contrast between the usage of formal words and common or familiar words in Chavacano:

==Writing system==
{{contradiction|Are there 29 or 30 letters--is &lt;rr&gt; a letter?|date=January 2016}}

Chavacano is written using the [[Latin script]]. As Chavacano has mostly been a [[spoken language]] than a written one, multiple ways of writing the different varieties of Chavacano exist. Most published Chavacano texts utilize spelling systems nearly identical to Spanish, adjusting certain spellings of words to reflect how they are pronounced by native Chavacano speakers. Since the propagation of the usage of the [[Filipino language]] in education and the media as the national language, Filipino's orthography has affected how certain persons might spell Chavacano, especially since recent generations have grown unfamiliar with Spanish orthography; Most published works, and the general media, however more often retain Spanish-based spelling systems.

The kind of writing system used to write Chavacano may differ according to the writer of the text. Writing may be written using a Spanish-derived writing system, where all words (including words of local origin) are spelled adhering to basic Spanish orthographic rules; it may also be written "phonetically", similar to the modern orthography of Filipino; another writing style uses a mixture of the two, spelling words based on an etymological approach.

in Zamboanga, an etymological-based approach was formally recently endorsed by the local city government and this is the system used in public schools as part of the mother-tongue policy of the Department of Education for kindergarten to grade 3. In principle, words of Spanish origin are to be spelled using Spanish rules while Chavacano words of local origin are spelled in the manner according to their origin. Thus, the letter ''k'' appear mostly in words of [[Austronesian]] origin or in loanwords from other Philippine languages (words such as ''kame'', ''kita'', ''kanamon'', ''kaninyo'').
&lt;!--Unsourced:
Some additional characters like the ''ñ'' (''eñe'', representing the phoneme {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, a letter distinct from ''n'' but typographically composed of an ''n'' with a [[tilde]]), the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ch'' ({{lang|es|che}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/tʃ/}}), the ''ll'' ({{lang|es|elle}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/ʎ/}}), and the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''rr'' ({{lang|es|erre}} with strong ''r'') exist in Chavacano.--&gt;

It is uncommon in modern written works to include the [[acute accent]] and the [[trema (diacritic)|trema]] in writing except in linguistic or highly formalized texts. Also, the letters ''ñ'' and ''ll'' are sometimes replaced by ''ny'' and ''ly'' in informal texts.

===Alphabet===

The Chavacano alphabet has 30 letters, including &lt;ch&gt;, &lt;ll&gt;, &lt;ñ&gt; and &lt;rr&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Languages of the Southern Gateway: Chavacano, Sinama, Tausug, Yakan|last=Department of Education, Culture and Sports and The Summer Institute of Linguistics|first=|publisher=The Summer Institute of Linguistics|year=1979|isbn=9711801310|location=Manila, Philippines|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other letter combinations include ''rr'' (erre), which is pronounced {{IPA|/xr/}} or {{IPA|/r/}}, and ''ng,'' which is pronounced {{IPA|/ŋɡ/}}. Another combination was ''ñg,'' which was pronounced {{IPA|/ŋ/}} but is now obsolete and is only written as ''ng''.

Some sounds are not represented in the Chavacano written language. These sounds are mostly in words of Philippine and foreign origin. Furthermore, the pronunciation of some words of Spanish origin have become distorted or Philippinized in modern Chavacano. Some vowels have become allophonized ('e' and 'o' becomes 'i' and 'u' in some words) and some consonants have changed their pronunciation. (i.e. ''escoger'' became ''iscují'' in informal speech; ''tiene'' {{IPA|/tʃɛnɛ/}}; ''Dios'' {{IPA|/dʒɔs/}}; ''Castilla'' became {{IPA|/kastilla/}} instead of {{IPA|/kastiʎa/}}).

Glottal stops, as in Filipino languages, are not also indicated (â, ê, î, ô, û). These sounds are mainly found in words of Philippine origin and are only indicated in dictionaries (i.e. jendê = not; olê = again) and when they are, the circumflex accent is used.

Other pronunciation changes in some words of Spanish origin include:

: f ~ {{IPA|/p/}}
: j, g (before 'e' and 'i') ~ /{{IPA|h}}/ (in common with dialects of [[Caribbean Spanish|Caribbean]] and other areas of [[Spanish language in the Americas|Latin America]] and [[Andalusian Spanish|southern Spain]])
: ch ~ {{IPA|/ts/}}
: rr ~ {{IPA|/xr/}}
: di, de ~ {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (when followed or preceded by other vowels: Dios ~ /jos/ ; dejalo ~ /jalo/)
: ti, te ~ {{IPA|/tʃ/}} (when followed or preceded by other vowels: tierra ~ /chehra/; tiene ~ /chene/)
: ci, si ~ {{IPA|/ʃ/}}  (when followed or preceded by other vowels: conciencia ~ /konʃenʃa/)

[b, d, g] between vowels which are [[fricatives|fricative]] [[allophones]] are pronounced as they are in Chavacano.

===Other sounds===

: -h {{IPA|/h/}} (glottal fricative in the final position); sometimes not written
: -g {{IPA|/k/}}; sometimes written as just -k
: -d {{IPA|/t/}}; sometimes written as just -t
: -kh [{{IPA link|x}}]; only in loanwords of Arabic origin, mostly Islamic terms

===Sounds from English===

: “z” pronounced as English “z” (like: zebra)  (zi)
: “x” pronounced as English “x” (like: X-ray)  (ex/eks)

==Grammar==

===Simple sentence structure (verb–subject–object word order)===

Chavacano is a language with the [[verb–subject–object]] sentence order. This is because it follows the Hiligaynon or Tagalog grammatical structures. However, the [[subject–verb–object]] order does exist in Chavacano but only for emphasis purposes (see below). New generations have been slowly and vigorously using the S-V-O pattern mainly because of the influence of the English language. These recent practices have been most prevalent and evident in the mass media particularly among Chavacano newswriters who translate news leads from English or Tagalog to Chavacano where the "who" is emphasized more than the "what". Because the mass media represent "legitimacy", it is understood by Chavacano speakers (particularly Zamboangueños) that the S-V-O sentence structure used by Chavacano journalists is standardized.

====Declarative affirmative sentences in the simple present, past, and future tenses====

Chavacano generally follows the simple verb–subject–object or verb–object–subject sentence structure typical of Hiligaynon or Tagalog in declarative affirmative sentences:

:'''Ta comprá''' (verb) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object).
:'''Ta comprá''' (verb) '''tierra''' (object) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject).
::Hiligaynon: Nagabakal (verb) ang mga manogbaligya (subject) sang duta (object).
::Hiligaynon: Nagabakal (verb) sang duta (object) ang mga manogbaligya (subject).
::Tagalog: Bumibili (verb) ang mga negosyante (subject) ng lupa (object).
::Tagalog: Bumibili (verb) ng lupa (object) ang mga negosyante (subject).
:::(‘The businessmen are buying land.’)

The subject always appears after the verb, and in cases where pronominal subjects (such as personal pronouns) are used in sentences, they will never occur before the verb:

:'''Ya andá yo na iglesia enantes'''.
::(‘I went to church a while ago.’)

====Declarative negative sentences in the simple present, past, and future tenses====

When the predicate of the sentence is negated, Chavacano uses the words '''jendeh''' (from Tagalog ’hindi’ or Hiligaynon 'indi' which means ’no’; the Cebuano uses 'dili', which shows its remoteness from Chavacano as compared to Hiligaynon) to negate the verb in the present tense, '''no hay''' (which literally means ’none’) to negate the verb that was supposed to happen in the past, and '''jendêh''' or '''nunca''' (which means ’no’ or ’never’) to negate the verb that will not or will never happen in the future respectively. This manner of negating the predicate always happens in the verb–subject–object or verb–object–subject sentence structure:

Present Tense

:'''Jendêh ta comprá''' (verb) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object).

::(Eng: The businessmen will never buy land. Span: Los hombres de negocio nunca comprarán terreno)

The negator '''jendeh''' can appear before the subject in a subject–verb–object structure to negate the subject rather than the predicate in the present, past, and future tenses:

Present Tense

:'''Jendêh el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''ta comprá''' (verb) '''con el tierra''' (object) '''sino el maga/mana empleados'''.
::(Eng: It is not the businessmen who are buying land but the employees. Span: No es el hombre de negocio que están comprando terreno sino los empleados)

Past Tense

:'''Jendêh el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''ya comprá''' (verb) '''con el tierra''' (object) '''sino el maga/mana empleados'''.
::(Eng: It was not the businessmen who bought the land but the employees. Span: No fue el hombre de negocio que compró el terreno sino los empleados)

Future Tense

::(Eng: It will not be the businessmen who will buy land but the employees. Span: No sería el hombre de negocio que comprará el terreno sino los empleados)

The negator '''nunca''' can appear before the subject in a subject–verb–object structure to strongly negate (or denote impossibility) the subject rather than the predicate in the future tense:

Future Tense

:'''Nunca el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''ay comprá''' (verb) '''con el tierra''' (object) '''sino el maga/mana empleados'''.
:'''Nunca ay comprá''' (verb) '''el mana/maga negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object) '''sino el maga/mana empleados'''.
::(Eng: It will never be the businessmen who will buy land but the employees. Span: Nunca sería el hombre de negocio que comprará el terreno sino los empleados)

The negator '''no hay''' and '''nunca''' can also appear before the subject to negate the predicate in a subject–verb–object structure in the past and future tenses respectively. Using '''nunca''' before the subject to negate the predicate in a subject–verb–object structure denotes strong negation or impossibility for the subject to perform the action in the future:

Past Tense

:'''No hay el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''comprá''' (verb) '''con el tierra''' (object).
::(Eng: The businessmen did not buy land. Span: el hombre de negocio no compró terreno)

Future Tense

:'''Nunca el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''ay comprá''' (verb) '''con el tierra''' (object).
::(Eng: The businessmen will never buy land. Span: el hombre de negocio nunca comprará terreno)

===Nouns and articles===

The Chavacano definite article '''el''' precedes a singular noun or a plural marker (for a plural noun). The indefinite article '''un''' stays constant for gender as 'una' has almost completely disappeared in Chavacano, except for some phrases like "una vez". It also stays constant for number as for singular nouns. In Chavacano, it is quite common for '''el''' and '''un''' to appear together before a singular noun, the former to denote certainty and the latter to denote number:

:'''el cajón''' (’the box’) – '''el maga/mana cajón(es)''' (’the boxes’)
:'''un soltero''' (’a bachelor’) – '''un soltera''' (’a spinster’)
:'''el un soltero''' (’the bachelor’) – '''el un soltera''' (’the spinster’)

Nouns in Chavacano are not always preceded by articles. Without an article, a noun is a generic reference:

:'''Jendeh yo ta llorá lagrimas sino sangre'''.
::(’I do not cry tears but blood’.)
:'''Ta cargá yo palo'''.
::(’I am carrying wood’).

Proper names of persons are preceded by the definite article '''si''' or the phrase '''un tal''' functioning as an indefinite article would:

:'''Un bonita candidata si Maria.'''.
::(’Maria is a beautiful candidate’.)
:'''un tal Juancho'''
::(’a certain Juancho’)

====Singular nouns====

Unlike in Spanish, Chavacano [[nouns]] derived from Spanish do not follow gender rules in general. In Zamboangueño, the [[article (grammar)|article]] 'el' basically precedes every singular noun. However, this rule is not rigid (especially in Zamboangueño) because the formal vocabulary mode wherein Spanish words predominate almost always is the preferred mode especially in writing. The Spanish article 'la' for feminine singular nouns does exist in Chavacano, though it occurs rarely and mostly in the formal medium of writing, such as poems and lyrics. When accompanying a Spanish feminine noun, the 'la' as the article is more tolerated than acceptable.  Among the few exceptions where the 'la' occurs is as a formal prefix when addressing the Blessed Virgin Mary, perhaps more as an emphasis of her importance in Christian devotion. But the real article is still the 'el', which makes this use of a "double article" quite unique. Thus it is common to hear the Blessed Virgin addressed in Chavacano as 'el La Virgen Maria' (the "L" of the 'la' capitalized to signify its permanent position within the noun compound). In general, though, when in doubt, the article 'el' is always safe to use. Compare:

{| class="wikitable"
!English singular noun

!Chavacano singular noun (accepted or uncommon)
|-
|the virgin
|el virgen
|la virgen (accepted)

|the peace
|el paz
|la paz (accepted)
|-
|the sea
|el mar
|la mar (accepted)
|-

|la vista (accepted)
|-
|the tragedy
|el tragedia
|el tragedia (la tragedia is uncommon)
|-
|the doctor
|el doctor
|el doctora (la doctora is uncommon)
|}

And just like Spanish, Chavacano nouns can have gender but only when referring to persons. However, they are always masculine in the sense (Spanish context) that they are generally preceded by the article 'el'. Places and things are almost always masculine. The -o is dropped in masculine nouns and -a is added to make the noun feminine:

{| class="wikitable"
!English singular noun
!Chavacano singular noun (masculine)
!Chavacano singular noun (feminine)
|-
|the teacher
|el maestro
|el maestra
|-
|the witch
|el burujo
|el buruja
|-
|the engineer
|el engeniero
|el engeniera
|-
|the tailor/seamstress
|el sastrero
|el sastrera
|-
|the baby
|el niño
|el niña
|-
|the priest/nun
|el padre / sacerdote
|el madre / monja
|-
|the grandson/granddaughter
|el nieto
|el nieta
|-
|the professor
|el profesor
|el profesora
|-
|the councilor
|el consejal
|el consejala
|}

Not all nouns referring to persons can become feminine nouns. In Chavacano, some names of persons are masculine (because of the preceding article 'el' in Spanish context) but do not end in -o.

:Examples: '''el alcalde''', '''el capitan''', '''el negociante''', '''el ayudante''', '''el chufer'''

All names of animals are always masculine—in Spanish context—preceded by the article 'el'.

:Examples: '''el gato''' (gata is uncommon), '''el puerco''' (puerca is uncommon), '''el perro''' (perra is uncommon)

Names of places and things can be either masculine or feminine, but they are considered masculine in the Spanish context because the article 'el' always precedes the noun:

:'''el cocina''', '''el pantalón''', '''el comida''', '''el camino''', '''el trapo''', '''el ventana''', '''el mar'''

====Plural nouns====

In Chavacano, plural nouns (whether masculine or feminine in Spanish context) are preceded by the retained singular masculine Spanish article 'el'. The Spanish articles 'los' and 'las' have almost disappeared. They have been replaced by the modifier (a plural marker) 'maga/mana' which precedes the singular form of the noun. Maga comes from the native Hiligaynon 'maga' or the Tagalog 'mga'. The formation of the Chavacano plural form of the noun (el + maga/mana + singular noun form) applies whether in common, familiar or formal mode. It may be thought of as roughly equivalent to saying in English, "the many (noun)" instead of "the (noun)s".

There are some Chavacano speakers (especially older Caviteño or Zamboangueño speakers) who would tend to say 'mana' for 'maga'. 'Mana' is accepted and quite common, especially among older speakers, but when in doubt, the modifier 'maga' to pluralize nouns is safer to use.

{| class="wikitable"
!English plural noun
!Chavacano plural noun (masculine)
!Chavacano plural noun (feminine)
|-
|the teachers
|el maga/mana maestro(s)
|el maga/mana maestra(s)
|-
|the witches
|el maga/mana burujo(s)
|el maga/mana buruja(s)
|-
|the engineers
|el maga/mana engeniero(s)
|el maga/mana engeniera(s)
|-
|the tailors/seamstresses
|el maga/mana sastrero(s)
|el maga/mana sastrera(s)
|-
|the babies
|el maga/mana niño(s)
|el maga/mana niña(s)
|-
|the priests/nuns
|el maga/mana padre(s)
|el maga/mana madre(s)
|-
|the grandsons/granddaughters
|el maga/mana nieto(s)
|el maga/mana nieta(s)
|-
|the professors
|el maga/mana professor(es)
|el maga/mana profesora(s)
|-
|the councilors
|el maga/mana consejal(es)
|el maga/mana consejala(s)
|}

Again, this rule is not rigid (especially in the Zamboangueño formal mode). The articles 'los' or 'las' do exist sometimes before nouns that are pluralized in the Spanish manner, and their use is quite accepted:

:'''los caballeros''', '''los dias''', '''las noches''', '''los chavacanos''', '''los santos''', '''las mañanas''', '''las almujadas''', '''las mesas''', '''las plumas''', '''las cosas'''

When in doubt, it is always safe to use 'el' and 'maga or mana' to pluralize singular nouns:

:'''el maga/mana caballero(s)''', '''el maga/mana día(s)''', '''el maga/mana noche(s)''', '''el maga/mana chavacano(s)''', '''el maga/mana santo(s)''', '''el maga/mana día(s) que viene''' (this is a phrase; 'el maga/mana mañana' is uncommon), '''el maga/mana almujada(s)''', '''el maga/mana mesa(s)''', '''el maga/mana pluma(s)'''

In Chavacano, it is common for some nouns to become doubled when pluralized (called ''[[Reduplication]]'', a characteristic of the Malayo-Polynesian family of languages):

:'''el maga cosa-cosa''' (el maga cosa/s is common), '''el maga casa casa''' (el maga casa is common), '''el maga gente gente''' (el maga gente is common), '''el maga juego juego''' (el maga juego is common)

But note that in some cases, this "reduplication" signifies a difference in meaning.  For example,  'el maga bata' means 'the children' but 'el maga bata-bata' means one's followers or subordinates, as is a gang or mob.

In general, the suffixes -s, -as, -os to pluralize nouns in Spanish have also almost disappeared in Chavacano. However, the formation of plural nouns with suffixes ending in -s, -as, and -os are accepted. Basically, the singular form of the noun is retained, and it becomes plural because of the preceding modifier/plural marker 'maga' or 'mana':

:'''el maga/mana caballeros''' (accepted)
:'''el maga/mana caballero''' (correct)
:'''el maga/mana días''' (accepted)
:'''el maga/mana día''' (correct)

Adding the suffix -es to some nouns is quite common and accepted. Nouns ending in -cion can be also be pluralized by adding the suffix -es:

:'''el maga meses''', '''el maga mujeres''', '''el maga mayores''', '''el maga tentaciones''', '''el maga contestaciones''', '''el maga naciones''', '''el maga organizaciones'''

However, it is safer to use the general rule (when in doubt) of retaining the singular form of the noun preceded by the modifier/plural marker 'maga' or 'mana':

:'''el maga mes''', '''el maga mujer''', '''el maga mayor''', '''el maga tentación''', '''el maga contestación''', '''el maga nación''', '''el maga organización'''

===Pronouns===

Chavacano pronouns are based on Spanish and native sources; many of the pronouns are not used in either but may be derived in part.

In contrast to the other varieties of Chavacano, the variety spoken in Zamboanga uses more pronouns derived from a native Philippine language (I.e. Hiligaynon) in addition to Spanish. In Zamboangueño, there are three different levels of usage for certain pronouns depending on the level of familiarity between the speaker and the addressee, the status of both in family and society, or the mood of the speaker and addressee at the particular moment: ''common'', ''familiar'', and ''formal''. The common forms are, particularly in the second and third person plural, derived from Cebuano while most familiar and formal forms are from Spanish. The ''common forms'' are used to address a person below or of equal social or family status or to someone is who is acquainted. The common forms are used to regard no formality or courtesy in conversation. Its use can also mean rudeness, impoliteness or offensiveness. The ''familiar forms'' are used to address someone of equal social or family status. It indicates courteousness, and is commonly used in public conversations, the broadcast media, and in education. The ''formal forms'' are used to address someone older and/or higher in social or family status. It is the form used in writing.

Additionally, Zamboangueño is the only variety of Chavacano which distinguishes between the [[inclusive and exclusive we|inclusive we]] (''kita'') – including the person spoken to (the addressee) – and the [[inclusive and exclusive we|exclusive we]] (''kame'') – excluding the person spoken to (the addressee) – in the first person plural except in the formal form where ''nosotros'' is used for both.

====Personal (Nominative/Subjective Case) Pronouns====

Below is a table comparing the personal pronouns in three varieties of Chavacano.

====Possessive Pronouns (Chavacano de Zamboanga, Chabacano Abakay)====

The usage modes also exist in the possessive pronouns especially in Zamboangueño. ''Amon'', ''Aton'', ''ila'' and ''inyo'' are obviously of Hiligaynon(Ilonggo) but not Cebuano(Bisaya) origins, and when used as pronouns, they are of either the common or familiar mode. The inclusive and exclusive characteristics peculiar to Zamboangueño appear again in the 1st person plural. Below is a table of the possessive pronouns in the Chavacano de Zamboanga:

{| class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
!Zamboangueño
!Chabacano Abakay (de Davao)
|-
|'''1st person singular'''
|mi&lt;br&gt;mío&lt;br&gt;de mi&lt;br&gt;de mío&lt;br&gt;di mio/dimiyo
|mi

|-
|'''2nd person singular'''

|-
|'''3rd person singular'''
|su&lt;br&gt;suyo&lt;br&gt;de su&lt;br&gt;de suyo/disuyo

|-
|'''1st person plural'''
|de amón/diamon (''common/familiar'') (exclusive)&lt;br&gt;de atón/diaton (''common/familiar'') (inclusive)&lt;br&gt;nuestro (''formal'')&lt;br&gt;de/di nuestro (''formal'')
|nuestro
|-
|'''2nd person plural'''
|de iño/di inyo (''common'')&lt;br&gt;de vosotros (''familiar'')&lt;br&gt;de ustedes (''formal'')
|vos
|-
|'''3rd person plural'''
|de ila (''common/familiar'')&lt;br&gt;de ellos/di ellos (''formal'')
|de ellos
|}

===Verbs===

In Zamboangueño, Chavacano verbs are mostly Spanish in origin. In contrast with the other varieties, there is rarely a Zamboangueño verb that is based on or has its origin from other Philippine languages. Hence, verbs contribute much of the Spanish vocabulary in Chavacano de Zamboanga.

Generally, the simple form of the Zamboangueño verb is based upon the infinitive of the Spanish verb, minus the final /r/. For example, ''continuar'', ''hablar'', ''poner'', ''recibir'', and ''llevar'' become ''continuá'', ''hablá'', ''poné'', ''recibí'', and ''llevá'' with the accent called "acento agudo" on the final syllable.

There are some rare exceptions. Some verbs are not derived from infinitives but from words that are technically Spanish phrases or from other Spanish verbs. For example, ''dar'' (give) does not become 'da' but ''dale'' (give) (literally in Spanish, to "give it" [verb phrase]). In this case, ''dale'' has nothing to do with the Spanish infinitive ''dar''. The Chavacano ''brinca'' (to hop) is from Spanish ''brincar'' which means the same thing.

====Verb Tenses - Simple tenses====

Chavacano of Zamboangueño uses the words ''ya'' (from Spanish ''ya'' [already]), ''ta'' (from Spanish ''está'' [is]), and ''ay'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:

{| class="wikitable"
!English Infinitive
!Spanish Infinitive
!Zamboangueño Infinitive
!Past Tense

|-
|to sing
|cantar
|cantá

|ya dormí
|ta dormí
|ay dormí
|-
|to ask (of something)
|pedir
|pedí
|ya pedí
|ta pedí
|ay pedí
|}

The Chabacano of Cavite uses the words ''ya'', ''ta'', and ''di'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:

{| class="wikitable"
!English Infinitive
!Spanish Infinitive

|ya dormí
|ta dormí
|di dormí
|-
|to ask (of something)
|pedir
|pedí
|ya pedí
|ta pedí
|di pedí
|}

While the Chabacano of Ternate (Bahra) uses the words ''a'', ''ta'', and ''di'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:

{| class="wikitable"
!English Infinitive
!Spanish Infinitive
!Chabacano Infinitive
!Past Tense
!Present Tense

|a bebé
|ta bebé

|-
|to sleep

|a dormí
|ta dormí
|di dormí
|-
|to ask (of something)
|pedir
|pedí
|a pedí
|ta pedí
|di pedí
|}
Unlike in the Zamboangueño, Caviteño, and Ternateño, Chabacano Abakay (Davaoeño) doesn't have the ''ya'' and ''ta'' prefix. The infinitives and their conjugations are somehow retained, and there are some that have simplified conjugations:
{| class="wikitable"

|dormir
|durmió
|duerme
|dormí
|-
|to ask (of something)
|pedir
|pedir
|pidió
|pide
|pedí
|}

=====Perfect constructions=====

In Zamboangueño, there are three ways to express that the verb is in the [[present perfect]]. First, ''ya'' can appear both before and after the main verb to express that in the present perspective, the action has already been completed somewhere in the past with the accent falling on the final ''ya''. Second, ''ta'' and ''ya'' can appear before and after the verb respectively to express that the action was expected to happen in the past (but did not happen), is still expected to happen in the present, and actually the expectation has been met (the verb occurs in the present). And third, a verb between ''ta'' and ''pa'' means an action started in the past and still continues in the present:

{| class="wikitable"
!Chavacano Past Perfect
!Chavacano Present Perfect
!Chavacano Future Perfect
|-
|ya cantá ya.
|ta cantá pa. / ta canta ya.
|ay cantá ya.
|-
|ya bebé ya.
|ta bebé pa. / ta Bebe ya.
|ay bebé ya.
|-
|ya dormí ya.
|ta dormí pa. / ta dormi ya.
|ay dormí ya.
|-
|ya pedí ya.
|ya pedí pa. / ya pedí ya.
|ay pedí ya.
|}

The [[past perfect]] exists in Chavacano. The words ''antes'' (before) and ''despues'' (after) can be used between two sentences in the simple past form to show which verb came first. The words ''antes'' (before) and ''despues'' (after) can also be used between a sentence in the present perfect using ''ya'' + verb + ''ya'' and another sentence in the simple past tense:

{| class="wikitable"
!Past Perfect (Chavacano)
!Past Perfect (English)
|-
|Ya mirá kame el película antes de ya comprá con el maga chichirías.
|We had watched the movie before we bought the snacks.
|}

{| class="wikitable"
!Past Perfect (Chavacano)
!Past Perfect (English)
|-
|Ya mirá ya kame el película después ya comprá kame con el maga chichirías.
|We had watched the movie and then we bought the snacks.
|}

Zamboangueño Chavacano uses a verb between "ay" and "ya" to denote the [[future perfect]] and [[past perfect]] respectively:

{| class="wikitable"
!Future Perfect (Chavacano)
!Future Perfect (English)
|-
|Ay mirá ya kame el película si ay llegá vosotros.
|We will have watched the movie when you arrive.
|}

Zamboangueño Chavacano also uses a verb between "ta" and "ya" to denote the [[present perfect]]:

{| class="wikitable"
!Present Perfect (Zamboangueño Chavacano)
!Present Perfect (English)
|-
|Ta mirá ya kame con el película mientras ta 'sperá con vosotros.
|We are already watching the movie while waiting for you.
|}

====Passive and Active Voice====

To form the Zamboangueño Chavacano active voice, Zamboangueños follow the pattern:

'''El maga soldao ya mata con el criminal'''
The soldiers killed the criminal.

As illustrated above, active (causative) voice is formed by placing the doer ''el maga soldao'' before the verb phrase ''ya mata'' and then the object ''el criminal'' as indicated by the particle ''con''

Traditionally, Zamboangueño does not have a passive construction of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Chabacano de Zamboanga Handbook&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaic Spanish words and false friends==

Chabacano has preserved plenty of archaic Spanish phrases and words in its vocabulary that modern Spanish no longer uses; for example:

:"En denantes" which means 'a while ago' (Spanish: "hace un tiempo"). Take note that "En denantes" is an archaic Spanish phrase. Modern Spanish would express the phrase as "hace poco tiempo" or "hace un tiempo", but Chabacano still retains this archaic Spanish phrase and many other archaic Spanish words. This word is still being used in some areas of southern Spain.

:"Masquen"/"Masquin" means 'even (if)' or 'although'. In Spanish, "mas que" is an archaic Spanish phrase meaning 'although', nowadays replaced by the Spanish word "aunque".&lt;ref&gt;Brooks 1933, Vol. 16, 1st Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

:In Chavacano, the Spanish language is commonly called "castellano". Chavacano speakers, especially older Zamboangueños, call the language as "castellano" implying the original notion as the language of Castille while "español" is used to mean a Spaniard or a person from Spain.

:The pronoun "vos" is alive in Chavacano. While "vos" was used in the highest form of respect before the 16th century in classical Spanish and is quite archaic nowadays in modern Spanish (much like the English "thou"), in Chavacano it is used at the common level of usage (lower than tu, which is used at the familiar level) in the same manner of [[Cervantes]] and in the same manner as in certain Latin American countries such as Argentina (informally and in contrast with usted, which is used formally). Chavacano followed the development of vos in same manner as in Latin America – (the [[voseo]]) or, incidentally, as with English "thou" vs. "you".

:"Ansina" means 'like that' or 'that way'. In modern Spanish, "así" is the evolved form of this archaic word. The word "ansina" can still be heard among the aged in [[Mexico]] and is the only way of expressing this meaning in [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]].

On the other hand, some words from the language spoken in Spain have evolved or have acquired totally different meanings in Chavacano. Hence, for Castillian speakers who would encounter Chavacano speakers, some words familiar to them have become [[false friends]]. Some examples of false friends are:

:"Siguro"/"Seguro" means 'maybe'. In Spanish, "seguro" means 'sure', 'secure', or 'stable', although it could imply probability as well, as in the phrase, "Seguramente vendrá" (Probably he will come).

:"Siempre" means 'of course'. In Spanish, "siempre" means 'always'.

:"Firmi" means 'always'. In Spanish, "firme" means 'firm' or 'steady'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1657">In [[linguistics]], a feature of a word or phrase is said to be '''covert''' if there is no surface evidence of its existence within that word or phrase. For example, many languages have covert [[grammatical gender]] in nouns, in that there is no way to tell from the form of a noun which gender it is; gender only becomes apparent in, for example, [[article (grammar)|articles]] and [[adjectival agreement]], which depend on gender. In [[German language|German]] instruction, the article (''die'', ''der'', ''das'') is generally taught along with a noun, so that the student may remember which gender the noun is. In [[French language|French]], [[grammatical number]] is largely covert: the singular and plural forms of most nouns are identical in pronunciation. However, number is still relevant, as it affects articles and [[grammatical conjugation#Verbal_agreement|verbal agreement]], so it is still logical to say that one instance of a noun is singular, and that another instance, pronounced identically, is plural.

A covert feature is different from a [[null morpheme]], such as the [[English language|English]] singular, which is marked by the ''absence'' of a morpheme that occurs elsewhere. That is, whereas in English the null-marked singular contrasts with an overt ''-s'' plural in most nouns, in French both singular and plural are null; in English it is clear that ''cat'' is singular, because it is not the plural ''cats'', whereas in spoken French, it cannot be known whether ''chat(s)'' {{IPA|[ʃa]}} spoken in isolation is singular or plural.

'''Creative Market''' is an [[online marketplace]] for community-generated [[web design|design]] assets. The company sells [[graphics]], [[WordPress]] themes, [[stock photography]], and other [[digital goods]] for use by web creatives. Creative Market has over one million users and more than 250,000 purchasable items.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativemarket.com/about|title=About ~ Creative Market|website=Creative Market}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 2012 by Aaron Epstein, Chris Williams, and [[Darius A. Monsef IV]] in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1842780/5-tips-working-remotely-guy-who-works-reaaaally-remotely|title=5 Tips On Working Remotely From A Guy Who Works Reaaaally Remotely|date=16 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative Market has undergone three investment rounds, raising funds from notable [[Silicon Valley]] investors including [[500 Startups]], [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]], [[CrunchFund]], SV Angel, and [[Alexis Ohanian]].&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/07/creative-market-second-round/|title=Creative Market Nabs $1.3M From SV Angel, CrunchFund To Become An Etsy For Digital Design|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, 2014, the company was acquired by American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[software]] corporation [[Autodesk]] for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref name="zdnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/autodesk-adds-indie-design-startup-creative-market-to-toolset/|title=Autodesk adds indie design startup Creative Market to toolset - ZDNet|first=Rachel|last=King|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Creative Market first began in 2011 as a venture between Aaron Epstein, Chris Williams, and [[Darius A. Monsef IV]].&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com"/&gt; Epstein, Williams, and Monsef were the co-founders of COLOURlovers, a [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]]-backed [[social network service]] that provides [[color]] inspiration for both personal and professional creative projects.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt; The co-founders recognized that COLOURlovers was in need of a marketplace to help its community members exchange the digital goods they were creating, and hence created Creative Market.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt;

In May, 2011, the company raised $1,000,000 from [[500 Startups]] and other investors. In June, 2012, it raised an additional $1,300,000 from a consortium of investors, including [[500 Startups]], [[CrunchFund]], SV Angel, [[Longworth Venture Partners]], [[Ludilow Ventures]], and [[Alexis Ohanian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/creativemarket|title=Creative Market - Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013, the team hired Zack Onisko to lead its growth efforts, who previously served as [[BranchOut]]'s Director of Growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPdQhiIZ0Xs|title=The Art of Growth Hacking --  Zack Onisko SFIMA SMC 2015 1080p|first=|last=Vasil Azarov|date=20 May 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scripted.com/interviews-2/creative-market-content-marketing-strategy/|title=How Content Marketing Increased Creative Market's Blog Traffic Tenfold [Interview] - The Scripted Blog|date=29 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the team launched a [[Photoshop]] extension that allowed designers to preview and purchase Creative Market's digital assets directly within Photoshop itself. This made it easier for designers to find and integrate third-party digital assets within the workflow of their existing [[graphic design]] environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petapixel.com/2013/04/12/creative-market-launches-a-marketplace-extension-for-photoshop/|title=Creative Market Launches PS Extension, Lets You Buy Your Assets In-App|date=12 April 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/11/creative-market-previews-its-api-for-a-digital-asset-marketplace-with-photoshop-extension/|title=Creative Market Previews Its API For A Digital Asset Marketplace With Photoshop Extension|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired-photoshop"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/04/creative-market-photoshop-plugin/|title=Creative Market Gives Photoshop an App Store of Its Own|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Creative Market was acquired by Autodesk. The amount of the acquisition was not publicly announced.&lt;ref name="zdnet.com"/&gt; The entirety of the Creative Market team stayed with the company through the acquisition.&lt;ref name="tc-acquisition"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/19/autodesk-buys-creative-market-jumping-into-maker-marketplace/|title=Autodesk Buys Creative Market To Square Up To Adobe With A Marketplace For Designers And Makers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Creative Market's community members buy and sell creative assets for use in design and marketing projects. Assets include [[vector graphics]], website templates, [[stock photography]], document templates, [[web fonts|fonts]], and miscellaneous creative goods. As of mid-2015, over 250,000 products were available for purchase on Creative Market.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

Creative Market's content is submitted by its users through "shops." On behalf of its shop owners, Creative Market handles the distribution, [[E-commerce payment system|payment processing]], support, and assisted marketing for its products. Sellers retain 70% of the sale price on their goods, are not bound to exclusivity agreements with Creative Market, and set their own prices on goods they sell through the platform. The platform also provides sales statistics and a customer-seller messaging system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativemarket.com/sell|title=Sell your goods ~ Creative Market|website=Creative Market}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a form of [[inbound marketing|content marketing]], the company regularly runs promotions on bundles containing discounted creative goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/296631/pick-creative-markets-super-deluxe-bundle-graphics-fonts-photoshop-plug-ins-60-premium-items-worth-660-just-39-sponsored-post/|title=Check out the design goods bundle from Creative Market – over $690 value for just $39! [Sponsored post] - Cult of Mac|date=18 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pay it Forward==

In December 2014, Creative Market launched its ''Pay it Forward'' bundle in partnership with various companies in the [[web design]] space, including [[Dribbble]], [[Scribd]], [[Skillshare]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.skillshare.com/pay-it-forward-bundle/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000226/http://blog.skillshare.com/pay-it-forward-bundle/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bundle offered $4,500 USD worth of digital assets under a [[pay what you want]] pricing model. All proceeds went to [[Watsi]], a not-for-profit platform that enables individual donors to directly fund the medical care procedures for individuals in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://payitforwardbundle.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603055930/https://payitforwardbundle.com/ |archivedate=2015-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 18,000 bundles were purchased, totaling $150,000 USD in funds raised, which amounted to over 250 financed healthcare procedures for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.watsi.org/post/109314694561/the-pay-it-forward-bundle-raised-145k-for-watsi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615200434/http://blog.watsi.org/post/109314694561/the-pay-it-forward-bundle-raised-145k-for-watsi |archivedate=2015-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Wikipedia is not for advertising, nor is it a web directory. Don't add your links.--&gt;
'''Domain parking''' refers to the registration of an [[internet]] [[domain name]] without that domain being associated with any services such as [[e-mail]] or a [[website]].  This may have been done with a view to reserving the domain name for future development, and to protect against the possibility of [[cybersquatting]].  Since the [[domain name registrar]] will have set [[name server]]s for the domain, the registrar or [[domain name reseller|reseller]] potentially has use of the domain rather than the final registrant.

Domain parking can be classified as monetized and non-monetized. In the former, advertisements are shown to visitors and the domain is "monetized". In the latter, an "Under Construction" or a "Coming Soon" message may or may not be put up on the domain by the registrar or reseller. This is a single-page website that people see when they type the domain name or follow a link in a [[web browser]]. Domain names can be parked before a web site is ready for launching.

==Parked domain monetization==
Domain parking may also refer to an advertising practice, more precisely called "parked domain monetization", used primarily by [[domain name registrar]]s and internet advertising publishers to monetize [[type-in traffic]] visiting a parked or "under-developed" domain name. The domain name will usually [[Domain Name System|resolve]] to a [[web page]] containing advertising listings and links. These links will be targeted to the predicted interests of the visitor and may change dynamically based on the results that visitors click on. Usually the domain holder is paid based on how many links have been visited (e.g. [[pay per click]]) and on how beneficial those visits have been. The keywords for any given domain name provide clues as to the intent of the visitor before arriving.

Another use of domain parking is to be a placeholder for an existing web site. The domain holder might also choose to redirect a domain to another website it has registered, either through [[URL redirection]], domain cloaking or by pointing it as an alias of the main domain, although if this is done by the ultimate registrant, the domain is then in use, rather than parked. &lt;!-- Any in-depth info on how this works appreciated. --&gt; &lt;!-- broader explanation added above. --&gt;

Expired domains that were formerly websites are also sought after for parked domain monetization. A domain that was used as a website and is allowed to expire will still maintain most of its prior inbound links. These types of domains usually attract their largest amount of visitor traffic initially after being claimed from the domain drop lists. As website operators and search engines begin to remove the former inbound links, the traffic to the parked domain will begin to decline.  The process of re-registering expired names is known as [[Domain_drop_catching|''dropcatching'']] and various [[domain name registry|domain name registries]] have differing views on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nominet.org.uk/sites/default/files/policy/57514_Webb_Henderson_Background_Report_041011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205031719/http://www.nominet.org.uk/sites/default/files/policy/57514_Webb_Henderson_Background_Report_041011.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On domains with a 'one-click' implementation, a click on a keyword is not necessary to generate ad revenue. The ads are targeted based on the domain name.  Domains with 'two-click' implementations require a click on a keyword or a keyword search to generate ad revenue.

There are several companies that actively cater to domain name holders and act as middlemen to serve advertisements on parking pages. The parking pages are propagated automatically on a domain holder's web property when they either change the name servers or forward the URL.

'''''Eloise at Christmastime''''' is a 2003 [[live-action film]] based on the 1958 book of the same name written by [[Kay Thompson]] and illustrated by [[Hilary Knight (illustrator)|Hilary Knight]]. The film was produced by [[Handmade Films]] and [[DiNovi Pictures]] for [[Walt Disney Television]] with distribution handled by the [[ABC Television Network]]. It was released on both [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] in 2003 by [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]].  As of 2009, the movie was shown in the [[25 Days of Christmas]] programming block on [[ABC Family]], but it was not part of the block in 2010.&lt;ref name="ABCChristmas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/10/abc-family-25-days-of-christmas-kicks.html|title=We Love Soaps: ABC Family's "25 Days of Christmas" Kicks Off Sunday, December 1st|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 to 2013, it was aired on the [[Hallmark Channel]] as part of their "Countdown to Christmas".&lt;ref name="Shattuck"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html|title=What’s On Tuesday|last=Shattuck|first=Kathryn|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was aired on [[Discovery Family]].

The film stars young [[Sofia Vassilieva]] as [[Eloise (books)|Eloise]], a six-year-old girl who lives in the [[penthouse apartment|penthouse]] at the top of the [[Plaza Hotel]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Setoodeh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/sofia-vassilieva-next-big-thing-80873|title=Sofia Vassilieva: The Next Big Thing|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|date=25 June 2009|work=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndsmcobserver.com/2010/04/bald-and-beautiful-celebrities/|title=Bald and beautiful celebrities|date=21 April 2010|work=The Observer|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This story takes place immediately after the events of ''[[Eloise at the Plaza]]''; Eloise receives a package full of Spy stuff from her friend Leon, the supporting character in the previous film who did spy work with Eloise.

== Plot ==
The movie begins with a shot of the Hotel Lobby, with a large pink gift box leaning on the display table, in the middle of the room. The hotel manager, Mr. Salamone, asks one of the staff to take the box to the package room. Two of the staff take the gift box to the package room. When they leave, the box is opened and we see Eloise crawling out. Eloise is on a mission to find any presents in the package room from her mother, who has taken a trip to Paris.

When Eloise does not find any packages from her mother, she then leaves the room in a large mess. She skips towards the lobby, and pushes into a long line at the check-in desk and interrupts a conversation between Mr. Salamone and two patrons, wishing to upgrade their current hotel suite to a park-side view room.

Eloise asks Mr. Salamone if there have been any packages from her mother in Paris, and he replies that there hasn't. He pushes her away, telling Eloise that he is currently very busy. Eloise pushes in the line again, offering Mr. Salamone some unnecessary assistance. Mr. Salamone declines, pushing Eloise away from the hectic line.

Eloise leaves, but is instantly back in a flash, when she notices a suspicious man waiting in the queue. She thinks that this patron is a spy, but Mr. Salamone declines, and instantly changes the subject so that Eloise can leave the line. He requests Eloise to look out for the hotel's Christmas Tree Delivery, which is due to be at the Plaza any moment. He tells Eloise to inform him when the delivery arrives.

Eloise leaves the line, and tells the "spy" that she is keeping her eye on him.

The main focal point of the story deals with the impending [[marriage]] between Rachel Peabody, the hotel owner's daughter, and a bachelor named Brooks Oliver, who was chosen by Rachel's family to be her husband.

Eloise eventually learned that Oliver is into doing something suspicious. She also found out that Rachel had taken a liking to Bill, a room service waiter and one of her friends, four years earlier. When Mr. Peabody became aware of his daughter's relationship with Bill, he then sent his daughter to a university, hoping to break his daughter's ties with the waiter. Eloise then intervened with the relationship, much to the disappointment of Rachel's father.

She then succeeded at restoring Bill and Rachel's romance with each other; Oliver is then arrested for [[forgery]], and Mrs. Thornton, who was in danger of being [[eviction|evicted]], is granted a permanent stay at the Plaza. And to top it off, Eloise's mom arrives and they rejoice.

'''Gülhane Park''' ({{lang-tr|Gülhane Parkı}}, "Rosehouse Park"; from [[Persian language|Persian]]: {{nastaliq|گلخانه}} ''Gul&lt;u&gt;kh&lt;/u&gt;āna'', "house of flowers") is a historical [[urban park]] in the [[Eminönü]] district of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]; it is adjacent to and on the grounds of the [[Topkapı Palace]]. The south entrance of the park sports one of the larger gates of the palace.   It is the oldest and one of the most expansive public parks in Istanbul.

== History ==
The namesake of the park, the Gülhane ("Rosehouse") present on the grounds, was the place where the 1839 [[Edict of Gülhane]] ({{lang-tr|Tanzimât Fermanı}} or ''Gülhane Hatt-ı Şerif-î'') was proclaimed. The edict launched the [[Tanzimat]] reforms in the [[Ottoman Empire]], which modernized the empire and included changes such as the equalization of all Ottoman citizens, regardless of religion, before the law. The proclamation was made by Grand Vizier [[Mustafa Reşid Pasha]], a leading statesman, diplomat, and reformer in the Empire.

Gülhane Park was once part of the outer garden of [[Topkapı Palace]] and mainly consisted of a grove. A section of the outer garden was planned as a park by the municipality and opened to the public in 1912. The park previously contained recreation areas, coffee houses, playgrounds etc. Later, a small zoo was opened within the park.
The first statue of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] in Turkey was erected in the park in 1926, sculpted by [[Heinrich Krippel]].

The park underwent a major renovation in recent years; the removal of the zoo, fun fair and picnic grounds affecting an increase in open space. The excursion routes were re-arranged and the big pool was renovated in a modern style. With concrete structures removed the park regained the natural landscape of the 1950s, revealing trees dating from the 1800s.

[[File:Istanbul Museum of The History of Science and Technology in Islam.jpg|thumb|The Museum of The History of Science and Technology in Islam]]
The [[Istanbul Museum of the History of Science and Technology in Islam|Museum of The History of Science and Technology in Islam]] is located in the former stables of Topkapı Palace, on the western edge of the park. It was opened in May 2008 by the Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=22750|title=Turkish PM inaugurates museum in istanbul|publisher=World Bulletin|date=2008-05-24|accessdate=2009-06-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614074245/http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=22750|archivedate=2009-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum features 140 replicas of inventions of the 8th to 16th centuries, from astronomy, geography, chemistry, surveying, optics, medicine, architecture, physics and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomw.net.au/blog/2008/05/museum-of-technology-and-islam-opened.html|title=Museum of Technology and Islam Opened in Istanbul |publisher=Tomw Communications|date=2008-05-26|accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
The old [[barracks]] within the area of Gülhane is expected to be converted to a cultural center in due course; the center will host a library and exhibition hall together with a workshop on [[kilim]] and handicrafts.

'''''Himmelsbrief''''' also known as a "heaven's letter" (Bilardi, 2009), OR a "heavenly letter" (Kerr, 2002), is a name for religious documents said to have been written by [[God]] or a divine agent. Their purpose is to protect the bearer or place from all evil and danger; however, there is a price for their protection. Bearers will only be protected so long as they abide by the moral covenants detailed in the letter. (Bilardi, 2009)  

They are often said to have miraculously "fallen from sky", [[amulet|claim protection]] for owners of a copy (encouraging [[meme]]tic replication) and punishment for disbelievers.

Some authors reserve the name for [[Christian]] [[Apocrypha|apocryphal documents]], but similar pieces are found in [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]] and pre-Christian religions.

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] mentions one in ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'' (third century), and the earlier full text is a Latin one dated in the 6th century.

While preaching, Jacob, the organizer of the [[Crusade of the Shepherds]], held one which was allegedly given by the Virgin Mary.

==Pennsylvania German==
In the [[Pennsylvania German]] community, they are part of [[Pow-wow (folk magic)|Pow-wow]] tradition and contained [[Bible]] verses and other charms and assurances that their owners would be protected from death, injury, and other misfortune. The text of these letters is often written according to a long established formula (Herr, 2002) This is why it is sometimes believed that Himmelsbrief are the original chain letters.   Pow-wow practitioners charged handsome sums for these [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] letters; the price they commanded depended on the reputation of the practitioner. However, some traditions call for it to be given free of charge. A hand-written letter produced by a respected Hexenmeister or Braucher is regarded as a powerful talisman (Herr, 2002). Himmelsbrief may be written in order to communicate with someone departed, or to request assistance from God in heaven. (Herr, 2002) According to C.R.Bilardi in his book, The Red Church: or the Art of Pennsylvania German Braucherei (2009), two well known examples of these letters are the Koenigsberg Fire Brief of 1714 and the Magdeburg Himmelsbrief of 1783.

'''ITerating''' is a Wiki-based [[software]] guide, where users can find, compare and give [[reviews]] to software products. Founded in October 2005, and based in New York, ITerating was created by CEO Nicolas Vandenberghe, who saw that there was an industry need for a comprehensive resource to help evaluate software solutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itmanagersjournal.com/feature/24456 IT Manager’s Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

The site aims to be a reference guide for the IT industry and includes reviews, ratings, articles, and detailed product feature comparisons. ITerating uses [[Semantic Web]] tools (including RDF - [[Resource Description Framework]]) to combine user edits with Web service feeds from other sites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ddj.com/architect/201802233 Dr. Dobb's - Semantic Web Service Launched by Iterating&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed for use by [[real estate developers|developers]] and industry consultants, ITerating allows users to contribute to categories such as Software Engineering Tools; Website Design &amp; Tools; Website Software Tools; Website &amp; Communication Applications &amp; Social Networking; or to create their own category if does not exist yet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxpr.com/releases/9755.html Linux Today ] PR RELEASE&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wiki Matrix==
Iterating announced the addition of a Feature Matrix in June 2007, which allows users to dynamically create customized, side-by-side feature comparisons of software solutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://ajax.sys-con.com/read/387628.htm Ajax World Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

In information technology, '''information criteria''' are a core component of the [[COBIT]] framework that describes the intent of the objectives, namely the control of:

[[Effectiveness]] deals with information being relevant and pertinent to the business process as well as being delivered in a timely, correct, consistent and usable manner.

[[Efficiency]] concerns the provision of information through the optimal (most productive and economical) use of resources.

[[Confidentiality]] concerns the protection of sensitive information from unauthorised disclosure.

[[Integrity]] relates to the accuracy and completeness of information as well as to its validity in accordance with business values and expectations.

[[Availability]] relates to information being available when required by the business process now and in the future. It also concerns the safeguarding of necessary resources and associated capabilities.

[[Regulatory compliance|Compliance]] deals with complying with the laws, regulations and contractual arrangements to which the business process is subject, i.e., externally imposed business criteria as well as internal policies.

Reliability relates to the provision of appropriate information for management to operate the entity and exercise its fiduciary and
governance responsibilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2566">[[File:Ingeram Codex 278.jpg|thumb|Hans Ingeram's portrait, coat of arms and colophon]]
The '''Ingeram Codex''' (also ''Codex Cotta'', [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] A2302) is an [[armorial]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]
made by Hans Ingeram for [[Albert VI, Archduke of Austria]] in 1459.
It is largely concerned with the coats of arms of the ''Adelsgesellschaften'' ("societies of nobles") fashionable at the time, 
a type of society or order formed by members of the lower nobility with the purpose of holding [[tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].

The manuscript has 142 paper pages with depictions of coats of arms mostly in groups of four or six per page.

The contents are divided into
* [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] possessions and Austrian nobility (pp. 1&amp;ndash;10).
*''Exempla'', [[attributed arms]] to (partly legendary) "exemplary" persons (including the [[Nine Worthies]]). (12&amp;ndash;17)
*''Offices'' (18&amp;ndash;27)
*fragments of a "European" armorial  (28&amp;ndash;35)
*coats of arms of Habsburg Austria, including the seceded [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] (36&amp;ndash;39, p. 40 empty)
*coats of arms of ''Adelsgesellschaften'' ([[tournament (medieval)|tournament societies]])  (41&amp;ndash;134)
 
After the death of Albrecht VI, the manuscript passed to 
his brother, emperor Frederick III, and later to [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Ladislaus Jagiellon]], presumably via [[Matthias Corvinus]], who would have gained its possession when he invaded Vienna in 1485.
In 1541, it was owned by cardinal [[Gasparo Contarini]], and by 1751 it was in the antiquarian collection of count  [[Löwenstein-Wertheim]], whence it was acquired by publisher  [[Johann Friedrich Cotta]] in the early 19th century. Sold to one Heinrich Höfflinger in 1929, the codex finally passed to Kunsthistorisches Museum in 1971.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">The '''June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives''' is a [[grass roots]] archive founded in 1981 in [[Oakland, California]] as the "West Coast Lesbian Collections".  It is one of the largest archives in the world dedicated to collecting protecting and preserving [[Lesbian history|lesbian]] and [[Feminist history|feminist women's history]].  1985 the Archives moved to Southern California with the help of the Connexxus Women's Center&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Daring to Find Our Names: The Search for Lesbigay Library History|last = Carmichael, Jr.|first = James Vinson|publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |page = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt; and into the home of June Mazer and her partner Bunny Mac Culloch in [[Altadena, California]].  They took care of the Archives until June's death from cancer in 1987.  Bunny changed the name and continued to run the Archives with the help of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schroeder  50-51.|first=Stephanie|last2=Schenden|first2=Laurie K|date=2008|title=LESBIAN LIBRARIES|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=qth&amp;AN=32499499&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Curve|volume=18|issue=5|page=50–51|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1989 the Archive was moved from Altadena into the Wherle Building in [[West Hollywood]]. The Archives has been run strictly by volunteers for twenty-eight of its thirty-two years and has continued on supported by private donors and the City of West Hollywood. The Archives has created an outreach and collection-building partnership with the [[Charles E. Young Research Library|UCLA Libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = UCLA Digital Collections|url = http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/mazer/|website = digital2.library.ucla.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, Mazer co-hosted the 3rd GLBT ALMS ([[Archives, Libraries, Museums &amp; Special Collections]]) Conference. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3006210093_lgbt_alms_2011_conference|title = San Francisco Public Library|last =|first =|date = 2011|website = LGBT ALMS 2011 Conference|publisher =|access-date = 2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lgbtqalms.co.uk/2016/05/23/guest-post-alms-conference-2006-2016-and-beyond-lisa-vecoli/|title=ALMS Conference 2006-2016 and Beyond|last=Vecoli|first=Lisa|date=2016-05-23|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mac Carthaigh’s Book''''' is a collection of [[annals]] of the period AD [[1114 in Ireland|1114]]–[[1437 in Ireland|1437]] inclusive. It was compiled from earlier material by [[Florence MacCarthy|Fínghin Mac Carthaigh Mór]] (c. 1560–1640) an Irish nobleman who was imprisoned for years in London. He was a patron of learning and a scholar in his own right. While in London in 1633 he employed [[Diarmaid Ó Súilleabháin]] who also kept the book in his castle until it was sacked by Radhulbh MacAmlaoibh, then his [[clan]] took control of it, they copied and compiled these annals for him. 

The original manuscript is currently preserved in the [[National Library of Ireland]]. The annals were edited and translated by Séamus Ó hInnse and published in 1947 by the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] under the title ‘Miscellaneous Irish Annals’.

Mac Carthaigh's Book is important as one of the few native records of events in southern Ireland for the period it covers and it provides information on the effect the Norman Invasion had on Munster. Besides relying on other Irish annals it drew upon some foreign sources, notably [[Giraldus Cambrensis]]' ''Expugnatio Hibernica''.

The '''''Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law''''' ('''MPEPIL''') is an online encyclopedia dealing with [[international law]]. It is published under the auspices of Professor [[Rüdiger Wolfrum]], Director of the [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law]]. The initiative to compile the MPEPIL began in 2004 and the online version launched in September 2008. It represents a new edition of the ''Encyclopedia of Public International Law'' published between 1991 and 2001 by [[:de:Rudolf Bernhardt|Rudolf Bernhardt]]. In February 2012, the print edition&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199291687.do#.UL3CBmfH550 MPEPIL print edition], Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was published by Oxford University Press. The encyclopedia is [[peer review]]ed. 

In a 2013 review of the work, [[Sean D. Murphy]] wrote that: "All told, there is little question that the Max Planck Encyclopedia lives up to its claim as the definitive reference work for international law"&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean D. Murphy]], [http://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2115&amp;context=faculty_publications Book Review of the Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (Rüdiger Wolfrum, Ed., Oxford University Press, 2012)] in 107 American Journal of International Law 510 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''MPEPIL'' is an updated, comprehensive work covering the essential topics in international law. The new work is not just a revision of Rudolf Bernhardt’s encyclopedia. Instead, new authors completely rewrote nearly all entries. ''MPEPIL'' includes numerous new topics in order to capture the latest developments in international law. To do justice to the changing nature of the law, an increased emphasis has been be placed on the relevance of each keyword for contemporary international law. Particular attention has been paid to the contextualization of each topic within international law as well as the presentation of current trends while maintaining a focus on the mainstream/majority view. In order to reach the goal of avoiding a purely [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] perspective the assistance of [[Academia|academics]] and practitioners from various legal backgrounds and perspectives was obtained already in the early stages of the undertaking. The intention is that ''MPEPIL'' is a work that reflects international law from a global perspective while taking into account also regional views.

==Contents==
''MPEPIL'' currently contains 1,618 articles. A total of 1,700 articles are planned for the site, with four content updates per year. Upon completion, the ''MPEPIL'' will cover the following overarching subject areas and article types:

Mildred Steinbach (22 December 1906 – 28 September 2002) was an art historian and the fourth Chief Librarian of the [[Frick Art Reference Library]].

==Education==

Steinbach graduated from [[Vassar College]], [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Vassar College (1929). ''The Vassarion'', Poughkeepsie: Vassar College, p. 52. "U.S. School Yearbooks, 1880-2012," [http://www.ancestry.com Ancestry.com]. Retrieved 13 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She received a master's degree from the [[Institute of Fine Arts]], [[New York University]] in 1946, completing a thesis on Spanish Romanesque sculpture under the direction of [[Walter William Spencer Cook|Walter W.S. Cook]]. While in graduate school, she worked as a librarian at the Institute.

==Career==

In 1944, Steinbach joined the Library's staff as a reference librarian. Three years later, she was promoted to Assistant Librarian, a position she held for twenty-three years. A specialist in medieval art, she was instrumental in augmenting the [[Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive|Photoarchive's]] collection of illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Frick Art Reference Library Scrapbook (1960-1979). The Frick Collection/Frick Art Reference Library Archives, Frick Art Reference Library, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; She served as the Chief Librarian of the Library from November 1970 to December 1977. During her tenure, more than 17,000 publications and 21,000 photographs were added to the Library's collections.&lt;ref&gt;ARLIS/New York News (Winter 1999), p. 7. [http://arlisny.silkstart.com/down/eJwFwQEKgDAIAMAfOc1k2G!kMRa1NlIIen13LWJuKflxnR72BDiDdfvGba@DPnoSVFJcTJgV85qFkAxrgVnqD5vnE6Q=/v20no1_1999.pdf ARLIS/New York News]. Retrieved 11 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

The Library maintained a strict dress code until 1989. Before that year, women "wearing very short skirts, slacks or spike heels" were not admitted, and men had to wear jackets or coats while conducting research in the Library's reading room. In 1975, the artist [[May Stevens]] challenged this regulation, issuing a formal complaint to New York City's Human Rights Commission.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (1975). "Modernity May Be Checked at the Door." January 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Steinbach defended the dress code, noting that "we think it's a nice kind of decorum. Usually we have a great deal of cooperation." She added that the ban on spike heels was to keep visitors from falling on the slippery marble floors.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (1975). "Woman Artist Challenges Frick Library Over Pants." January 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harris' Encyclopedia.JPG|thumb|''Harris' Minor Encyclopedia'', 1803]]
'''''Harris' Minor Encyclopedia''''' is small [[encyclopedia]] compiled by The Rev. [[Thaddeus Mason Harris]] in 1803 in [[Dorchester, MA|Dorchester]], [[Massachusetts]], and published that year in [[Boston]] by [[West and Greenleaf]].&lt;ref&gt;Title page, Minor Encyclopedia, Boston, 1803&lt;/ref&gt; It was a revised American edition of ''[[Kendal's Pocket Encyclopedia]]'', edited extensively by Harris. It consists of four volumes of approximately 300 pages each in [[Book size|duodecimo]] (4 1/2 inches by 7 inches). There are no plates. 

Harris covers the [[arts]] and [[sciences]], and [[technology]], and topics of [[general knowledge]], but there are no [[geographical]], [[biographical]], or [[historical]] articles. The editor states, "Articles of local geography have been purposely omitted. The publications of Dr. Morse supersede the necessity of their introduction here...Biographical dictionaries, particularly those of Watkins and Jones, are in general circulation; and the public are expecting an elaborate and complete "Universal Biography," compiled by a Society of Literati in Albany. Nor was it possible to make these volumes the vehicle of HISTORICAL INFORMATION. It is a subject too extensive for our plan."&lt;ref&gt;The preface, ''Minor Encyclopedia'', Boston, 1803&lt;/ref&gt;

After publishing eleven album guides, the MusicHound series was sold to London-based [[Music Sales Group]],&lt;ref name="Ward/RockCritics" /&gt; whose company [[Omnibus Press]] had originally distributed the books outside America. The series' founding editor was [[Gary Graff]],&lt;ref name="Weingarten"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/livingmusic/view_by_role&amp;value1=Broadcasting&amp;mode=single&amp;recordID=1397961&amp;comparisonType0=is+equal+to&amp;comparisonType1=is+equal+to&amp;sortDirection0=Ascending&amp;sortDirection1=Ascending&amp;sortDirection2=Descending&amp;nextMode=list&amp;joinCondition1=OR&amp;column0=arena&amp;column1=arenatwo&amp;sortColumn0=informantlastname&amp;sortColumn1=informantfirstandmiddlename&amp;sortColumn2=date&amp;value0=Broadcasting |last= Weingarten |first=Emily|title=Interview Record (Gary Graff)|publisher=University of Michigan School of Music|date=October 17, 2006|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly a music critic with the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''.&lt;ref name="Ward/RockCritics" /&gt;

Subtitled "''The Essential Album Guide''", each publication typically contained entries providing an overview of an artist's career and dividing their work into categories such as "what to buy", "what's next", "what to avoid" and "worth searching for".&lt;ref name="Jordan/MH Blues"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jordan|first=Miles|url=http://jazztimes.com/articles/20649-musichound-blues-the-essential-album-guide|title=Jazz Reviews: ''MusicHound Blues: The Essential Album Guide''|work=[[JazzTimes]]|date=July–August 1999|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the MusicHound album guides were titles dedicated to [[Rock music|rock]], [[blues]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[world music]], [[Swing music|swing]], and [[Soundtrack album|soundtrack recordings]]. Further to the canine analogy in the series title, albums were graded according to a "bone" rating system: five bones constituting the highest score, down to a bold-rendered "woof!", signifying "dog food".&lt;ref&gt;Graff and Durchholz, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graff has said that he had envisioned the books as buyer's guides, specifically: "something akin to a good record store clerk or that fellow shopper you meet while you're looking through the racks and with whom you strike up a spontaneous conversation".&lt;ref name="Ward/RockCritics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Steven|url=http://rockcriticsarchives.com/interviews/garygraff/garygraff.html|title=Losin' His Mind in Detroit Rock City: An Interview with Gary Graff|publisher=rockcritics.com|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]]-owned Visible Ink also published a series of VideoHound film guides, beginning with 1996's ''Golden Movie Retriever''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1993746.VideoHound_s_Golden_Movie_Retriever_1997|last=Craddock|first=Jim|title=VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever 1997|publisher=[[Goodreads]]|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ordbog over det danske Sprog''''' (Danish: "dictionary of the Danish language") or '''''ODS''''' is a comprehensive dictionary of the [[Danish language]], describing its usage from c. 1700 to 1955 in great detail. So far 28 volumes have published from 1919 to 1956 with five supplementary volumes published 1992 to 2005. The project was begun by Danish linguist [[Verner Dahlerup]]. The full version of the ''ODS'' has been available in an online version since November 2005 as part of the project ordnet.dk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1478">'''Parfilage''' was a fashionable [[pastime]] among women at the [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in the 1760s and 1770s. While most forms of ladies' handwork involved making something, parfilage was the opposite: women spent their time unraveling gold and silver braid, lace, or [[epaulets]]. As the fad grew--[[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Grimm]]'s ''Correspondence littéraire'' referred to a "furor" for it in winter 1773&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Correspondance littéraire|last=Grimm|first=Melchior|publisher=Furne|year=1829–1831|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;--ornaments were made and sold solely for the purpose of being unmade. Ladies carried small sacks with them for the gold and silver threads they had salvaged. Taken to a goldsmith, the thread could be melted down and made into coins. In Britain, parfilage was sometimes known as "drizzling."&lt;ref&gt;

{{Status of religious freedom |Persecution}}
{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}

The [[Pew Research Center]] has performed studies on international [[religious freedom]], researching restrictions on religion originating from government prohibitions on [[free speech]] and religious expression as well as social hostilities undertaken by private individuals, organisations and social groups.&lt;ref name="prc-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Executive summary)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=491|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223318/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries around the world, Christians are subject to restrictions on speech, and suffer [[communal violence]] and [[hate crime]]s.

Scientific research about anti-Christian prejudice is not as well-developed as research about [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and [[Islamophobia]]. This is because the scientific study of prejudice, first undertaken by the pioneering Harvard psychologist [[Gordon Allport]] began in Christian cultural contexts where atheists and religious minorities such as Jews were the obvious out-groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allport|first=Gordon W.|date=1966|title=The Religious Context of Prejudice|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1384172|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=5|issue=3|pages=447–457|doi=10.2307/1384172}}&lt;/ref&gt;. More recently, sociologists have began to explore anti-Christian prejudice. For example, in a small-scale exploratory study of adolescent Christians in England, participants reported concern that being Christian was associated with lower peer-group status and intellectual inferiority (in comparision to atheists). Adolescent Christians also reported the use of slurs by school peers, such as 'bible-basher', and other hostile offensive jokes and comments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Daniel|date=2016|title=Reported Experiences of Anti-Christian Prejudice among Christian Adolescents in England|url=https://www.academia.edu/25082790/Reported_experiences_of_anti-Christian_prejudice_among_Christian_adolescents_in_England|journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=223–238|doi=10.1080/13537903.2016.1152679|issn=1353-7903|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Arson===
{{main|Church arson}}
Arson attacks on churches have been seen in Norway and the United States. Some arson attacks are considered [[hate crime]]s perpetrated for racial reasons by people inspired by racial [[hate group]]s.&lt;ref name="time.com-arson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fulton |first=Greg |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1171196,00.html |title=Time Magazine |publisher=Time.com |date=2006-03-08 |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpost-motivations"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/churches/churches.htm |title=Washington Post article |publisher=Washington Post article |date= |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headliners of the [[black metal]] genre have claimed responsibility for inspiring (and sometimes perpetrating) over fifty [[Norway|Norwegian]] church burnings from 1992 to 1996 alone.&lt;ref name=grude&gt;{{cite video | people = Grude, Torstein (Director) |date=1 January 1998|url=http://home.no/metalra/reviews/videos/satan_rides_the_media.html |title=Satan rir Media | medium = motion picture |location=Norway |publisher=Grude, Torstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most notable was [[Fantoft Stave Church]], which the police believed was destroyed by the one-man band [[Burzum]], [[Varg Vikernes]], also known as 'Count Grishnackh'.&lt;ref name=grude /&gt; The burnt-out shell of the building is featured on the cover of his 1993 [[extended play|EP]] ''[[Aske (EP)|Aske]]'' (Norwegian for 'ashes').

===Vandalism===
The [[vandalism]] or [[defacement (vandalism)|defacement]] of Christian property is one form of the expression of anti-Christian sentiment. The destruction of property held by churches and Christian individuals can be in violation of various criminal laws, and can violate [[hate speech]] laws if it is racially or religiously motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/peoria/2015/01/07/vandals-scrawl-hate-speech-across-phoenix-church/21422467/|title=Vandals scrawl hate speech across Phoenix church|date=7 January 2015|work=azcentral}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of anti-Christian sentiment in politics and culture ==

===Middle East===
{{see also|Christianity in the Middle East}}
Fiorello Provera of the [[European Parliament]] called the Middle East "the most dangerous place for Christians to live" and cited [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], who blamed the international community for failing to deal with what she considers a war against Christians in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Provera |first=Fiorello |title=Fiorello Provera: Christianity's Via Dolorosa |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Project_Syndicate/Story/STIStory_786856.html |accessdate=7 June 2012 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |date=9 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607042116/http://www.straitstimes.com/Project_Syndicate/Story/STIStory_786856.html |archivedate=7 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Lebanese president [[Amine Gemayel]] stated in 2011 that Christians had become the target of [[genocide]] after dozens of Christians were killed in deadly attacks in Egypt and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Lebanon Leader: Christians Target of Genocide|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-202_162-7208414.html|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=[[CBS News]]|date=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Israeli ambassador to the United States [[Michael Oren]], in the hundred years leading up to 2010 the Middle East's Christian population dwindled from 20% to less than 5%. Oren argues that with the exception of Israel, Christians in the Middle East have endured severe political and cultural hardships: in Egypt, Muslim extremists have subjected Coptic Christians to beatings and massacres, resulting in the exodus of 200,000 Copts from their homes; in Iraq, 1,000 Christians were killed in Baghdad between the years 2003 and 2012 and 70 churches in the country were burned; in Iran, converts to Christianity face the death penalty and in 2012 Pastor [[Yousef Nadarkhani]] was sentenced to death; in Saudi Arabia, private Christian prayer is against the law; in the Gaza Strip, half of the Palestinian Christian population has fled since Hamas seized power in 2007 and Gazan law forbids public displays of crucifixes; in the West Bank, the Christian population has been reduced from 15% to less than 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oren|first=Michael|title=Israel and the Plight of Mideast Christians|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203960804577239923033348982|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=9 March 2012|authorlink=Michael Oren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Egypt====
{{see also|Maspero demonstrations}}
In Egypt, the government does not recognize religious conversions from Islam to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fowler|first=Lilly|title=Coptic Christian ex-patriots keep a wary eye on Egyptian elections|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/coptic-christian-ex-patriots-keep-a-wary-eye-on-egyptian-elections/2012/06/18/gJQAL9d1lV_story.html|accessdate=23 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign missionaries are allowed in the country if they restrict their activities to social improvements and refrain from [[proselytizing]]. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[Pope Shenouda III]] was internally exiled in 1981 by President [[Anwar Sadat]], who then chose five Coptic bishops and asked them to choose a new pope. They refused, and in 1985 President [[Hosni Mubarak]] restored Pope Shenouda III, who had been accused of fomenting interconfessional strife. Particularly in Upper Egypt, the rise in extremist [[Islamist]] groups such as the [[Gama'at Islamiya]] during the 1980s was accompanied by increased attacks on Copts and on Coptic Orthodox churches; these have since declined with the decline of those organizations, but still continue. The police have been accused of siding with the attackers in some of these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/589977.stm |title=Funerals for victims of Egypt clashes |publisher=BBC News |date=4 January 2000 |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, one person was killed and twelve injured in simultaneous knife attacks on three Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4909378.stm |title=Knife attacks on Egypt churches |publisher=BBC News |date=14 April 2006 |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak in 2011, Egypt's Coptic Christians have been the target of increasing opposition and discrimination.{{fact|date=February 2018}} In 2011, anti-Christian activity in Egypt included church burnings, protests against the appointment of a Coptic Christian governor in [[Qena Governorate|Qena]], and deadly confrontations with the Egyptian army. On television Islamists referred to Christians as heretics and said they should be made to pay the [[jizya]] tax. A Coptic priest accused Islamists in the country of massacring uninfected pigs predominantly owned by Copts during a [[swine flu]] scare: "They killed these innocent pigs just because they thought they violated their religion in some way."  In October 2011 a draft resolution passed by the [[European Parliament]] accused Egypt of persecuting the country's Christian population. By mid-2012 10,000 Christians had fled the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fathi|first=Yasmine|title=Egypt Copts react to Islamist electoral win|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/28346.aspx|accessdate=19 June 2012|newspaper=[[Ahram Online]]|date=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mostafa"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mostafa|first=Abdallah|title=EU parliament accuses Egypt of persecuting Christian minority|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/eu-parliament-accuses-egypt-persecuting-christian-minority|accessdate=19 June 2012|newspaper=[[Al-masry Al-youm|Egypt Independent]]|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tevrov /&gt;

In July 2012, [[Dahshur]]'s entire Christian community, which some estimate to be as many as a hundred families, fled to nearby towns due to sectarian violence. The violence began in a dispute over a badly ironed shirt, which in turn escalated into a fight in which a Christian burned a Muslim to death, which in turn sparked a rampage by angry Muslims, while the police failed to act. At least 16 homes and properties of Christians were pillaged, some were torched, and a church was damaged during the violence.&lt;ref name="Riot leaves christians"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/riot-leaves-egyptian-village-christians-16930420 | title=Riot leaves an Egyptian village without Christians | publisher=ABC News | agency=Associated Press | date=4 August 2012 | accessdate=5 August 2012 | author=El Deeb, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2011 to 2013, more than 150 kidnappings, for ransom, of Christians had been reported in the [[Minya governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Hamza | last=Hendawi | title=Christians being targeted by kidnappers in Egypt | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/04/04/3323290/kidnappers-target-christians-in.html| work= | newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=[[Melbourne, Florida]] | pages= 11A | date=7 April 2013 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!---hard copy source differs from soft copy but is the same Associated Press item---&gt;

There is a long-running tension between Christians and Muslims in areas like Minya over whether churches may appear in the village. It is possible, legally speaking, for Christians to get a permit for built churches. However, civilian mobs are liable to attack the building if one's house is thought of as an unlicenced or not-yet-licensed church, or if one is thought to be building a new church.  Some Muslim villagers see churches as unclean. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Arraf |first1=Jane |title=For Christians In Egypt, Building A New Church Can Set Off Violence |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/06/14/532891324/for-christians-in-egypt-building-a-new-church-can-set-off-violence |website=National Public Radio |publisher=NPR |accessdate=3 July 2018 |date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Egyptian poet Fatima Naoot was convicted of "contempt of religion" and sentenced to three years in jail for a 2014 Facebook post criticising animal killing during Eid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mourad |first=Mahmoud |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-courts-poet-idUSKBN0L121M20150128 |title=Egyptian poet goes on trial accused of contempt of Islam |publisher=Reuters |date=2015-01-28 |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/185963/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-writer-Fatima-Naoot-sentenced-to--years-i.aspx |title=Egyptian writer Fatima Naoot sentenced to 3 years in jail for ‘contempt of religion’ - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four Coptic Christian juveniles were convicted of "contempt of religion" the next month, with three of them sentenced to five years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/egyptian-coptic-teens-hit-jail-sentence-contempt-islam-132419988.html |title=Egypt sentences Christian teens to jail for contempt of Islam |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=2016-02-25 |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraq and Syria====
{{See also|Christianity in Syria|Persecution of Christians by ISIL|Sectarianism and minorities in the Syrian Civil War#Christians}}

The consolidation of power in the hands of Shiite Islamists in Iraq since the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime has been to the detriment of Iraq's [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]] Christian communities. Friction between rival sects in [[Iraq]] has frequently resulted in violence being directed against Christians in the country. Consequently, there has been a flight of Christians from some areas to Europe and to the United States. Since 2003, hundreds of thousands of Christians have fled Iraq, such that the Christian population, which may have been as high as 1.4&amp;nbsp;million prior to the Iraq War, has dropped to 500,000, with numbers continuing to decline. Between 2003 and 2012 more than 70 churches were bombed. In 2007 Al Qaeda militants killed a young priest in Mosul, and in 2010 gunmen massacred 53 [[Assyrian Christians]] in a Baghdad church.&lt;ref name=tevrov&gt;{{cite news|last=Tevrov|first=Daniel|title=Syrian Christian Support For Assad Regime May Turn Out To Be A Losing Strategy|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/352983/20120616/syria-chirstians-bashar-al-assad-opposition.htm|accessdate=18 June 2012|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|date=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope marks Easter with call for end to violence in Syria|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/04/08/pope-marks-easter-with-call-for-end-to-violence-in-syria/|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=8 April 2012|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christians fleeing Iraq|url=http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120314/OPINION01/703149971/1036|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=[[Watertown Daily Times]]|date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arraf|first=Jane|title=A northern Iraqi Easter|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0408/A-northern-Iraqi-Easter|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Syrian Civil War]] and the spillover into Iraq, [[persecution of Christians by ISIL]] and other militant groups has been ongoing. The [[Fall of Mosul]] and the Assyrian town of [[Qaraqosh]] in the [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|2014 ISIL advance]] in Iraq led to an estimated 100,000 Assyrian Christian civilians being displaced. After the fall of Mosul, ISIL demanded Assyrian Christians in the city to [[Forced conversion|convert to Islam]], pay tribute, or face execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28381455|title=BBC News - Iraqi Christians flee after Isis issue Mosul ultimatum|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISIL begun marking homes of Christian residents with the [[Nun (letter)|letter ''nūn'']] for ''Nassarah'' ("Christian").&lt;ref name="BBC-1"&gt;{{cite news |date=August 7, 2014 |title=Iraqi Christians flee after Isis issue Mosul ultimatum |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28381455 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724045752/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28381455 |archivedate=24 July 2014 |accessdate=August 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph-2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Loveluck |first=Louisa |date=August 7, 2014 |title=Christians flee Iraq's Mosul after Islamists tell them: convert, pay or die |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/10977698/Christians-flee-Iraqs-Mosul-after-Islamists-tell-them-convert-pay-or-die.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730003543/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/10977698/Christians-flee-Iraqs-Mosul-after-Islamists-tell-them-convert-pay-or-die.html |archivedate=30 July 2014 |accessdate=August 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Christians, Yazidis (the latter whom were given only the choice of conversion or death) and other, mostly [[Shi'a]] Muslims (whom ISIL consider to be [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates]]) have abandoned their homes and land. The [[destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL]] has included the [[The Mosque of the Prophet Yunus (Jonah)|Mosque of the Prophet Jonah]], revered in all Abrahamic faiths.

====Israel====

In Tel Aviv in 2008, three teenagers burned hundreds of Christian Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;In a 2008 Tel Aviv incident, hundreds of copies of the New Testament, which had been handed out in the city (allegedly by [[Messianic Jews]] in order to convert Ethiopian Jews), were burned by three teenaged Orthodox students of Judaism.

=====Gaza=====
In 2007, the Gaza Strip had a tiny Christian minority of 2,500–3,000. The Hamas overthrow of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza during that year was accompanied by violent attacks against Christians and Christian holy sites by Islamic militants. A Catholic convent and Rosary Sisters school were ransacked, with some Christians blaming Hamas for the attack. In September 2007 Christian anxiety grew after an 80-year-old Christian woman was attacked in her Gaza home by a masked man who robbed her and called her an [[kafir|infidel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hadid|first=Diaa|title=For Gaza's Christians, new reality unsettling|url=http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/For-Gaza-s-Christians-new-reality-unsettling-1807109.php|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Houston Chronicle]]|date=27 June 2007|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abu Toameh|first=Khaled|title=Christian-Muslim tensions heat up|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast//Article.aspx?id=76420|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=25 April 2007|authorlink=Khaled Abu Toameh}}&lt;/ref&gt; That attack was followed less than a month later by a deadly assault on the owner of the only Christian bookstore in Gaza City.

'''Power politics''' (or, in [[German language|German]], '''''Machtpolitik''''') is a theory in [[international relations]], which contains the idea that distributions of power and interests, or changes to those distributions, are fundamental causes of war and of system stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lemke |first1=Douglas |title=Power Politics and Wars without States |journal=American Journal of Political Science |date=October 2008 |volume=52 |issue=Midwest Political Science Association |page=774 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25193849 |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The concept of power politics provides a way of understanding systems of [[international relations]]: in this view, nations compete for the world's limited [[resources]] and it is to an individual nation's advantage to be manifestly able to harm others.  Power politics prioritizes [[national interest | national self-interest]] over the interests of other nations or the [[international community]], and thus may include threatening one another with [[military]], [[economic]] or [[political]] aggression to protect one nation's own interest.  

Techniques of power politics include:

* [[deterrence theory]]
* conspicuous [[weapons development | weapons-development]] (including [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]] development)
* [[pre-emptive strike]]
* [[blackmail]]
* the massing of military units on a border, whether for stationing or for [[military exercise | exercises]]
* the imposition of [[tariff]]s or [[economic sanction]]s
* [[proxy war | proxy warfare]]
* [[bait and bleed]] and "bloodletting"
* [[balancing in international relations|hard]] and [[soft balancing]]
* [[buck passing]]
* [[covert operation]]s
* [[shock and awe]]
* [[asymmetric warfare]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4686">The '''Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland''', established in 1672, is an official register of [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] maintained by the [[Lyon Clerk and Keeper of the Records]]. As a public register, it can be seen by anyone on application, and on payment of a statutory fee.

==History==
The Register was established by [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1672. It is held at the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]], and contains every [[grant of arms]] by [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] since that date, as well as older coats of arms that the owners have chosen to register. Bearings that are not matriculated in the Register may not be used in Scotland, unless it can be proved that they were in use before 1672.

The first volume of the Register (now divided into two parts for ease of handling and conservation reasons) continued in use from 1672 until 1804, and contains 2,702 entries.&lt;ref&gt;Paul 1903, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with the arms of the Lyon Office, followed by the personal achievement of Sir [[Charles Erskine (officer of arms)|Charles Erskine]], [[Baronet|Bt]], who was Lord Lyon  at the time. Most of the arms in this volume are given in [[blazon]] only: relatively few are painted.&lt;ref&gt;Paul 1903, pp. xiv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the second volume in 1804 the arms are consistently painted.&lt;ref&gt;Paul 1903, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; The Register now consists of over eighty volumes of [[parchment]], and is illustrated by a succession of the most prominent heraldic artists working in [[Scotland]].

==Published ordinaries==
In 1893, Sir [[James Balfour Paul]], [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], published the contents of the first twelve volumes of the Register, to that date, in the form of an [[Ordinary of arms|ordinary]] (i.e. with the entries in blazon, rearranged by design; and with a name index): the work contained roughly 5,200 entries. Ten years later, by which time the Register had reached its sixteenth volume, he published an updated second edition including all arms registered to the end of 1901: this edition contained 5,532 entries. By 1973 the Register had reached its 57th volume, and in 1977 [[Court of the Lord Lyon|Lyon Office]] published a second volume of the ''Ordinary'': this covered all arms registered from 1902 to the end of 1973, and contained a further 6,040 entries. This volume was edited by David Reid of Robertland, [[Carrick Pursuivant]] (who died in December 1973, while the work was in progress), and Vivien Wilson.

The three published volumes are therefore:

==Digitisation==
The Register down to 1913 has been digitised, and is available on the [[National Archives of Scotland#ScotlandsPeople Website|ScotlandsPeople Website]] (maintained by the [[National Archives of Scotland]]). Searching the index is free, but there is a fee to view the page images.

'''''Rumpelstiltskin''''' is a fairytale popularly associated with Germany (where he is known as '''''Rumpelstilzchen'''''). The tale was one collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in the 1812 edition of ''[[Children's and Household Tales]]''. According to researchers at [[Durham University]] and the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]], the story originated around 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BBC|title=Fairy tale origins thousands of years old, researchers say|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35358487|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|author=Sara Graça da Silva, Jamshid J.

==Plot==


In order to appear superior, a [[miller]] lies to the king, telling him that his daughter can [[Spinning (textiles)|spin]] straw into [[gold]] (some versions make the miller's daughter [[blond]]e and describe the "straw-into-gold" claim as a careless boast the miller makes about the way his daughter's straw-like blond hair takes on a gold-like lustre when sunshine strikes it). The king calls for the girl, shuts her in a tower room filled with straw and a [[spinning wheel]], and demands she spin the straw into gold by morning or he will [[Decapitation|cut off her head]] (other versions have the king threatening to lock her up in a dungeon forever). When she has given up all hope, an [[imp]]-like creature appears in the room and spins the straw into gold in return for her necklace (since he only comes to people seeking a deal/trade). When next morning the king takes the girl to a larger room filled with straw to repeat the feat, the imp once again spins, in return for the girl's ring. On the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] day, when the girl has been taken to an even larger room filled with straw and told by the king that he will marry her if she can fill this room with gold or execute her if she cannot, the girl has nothing left with which to pay the strange creature. He extracts from her a promise that she will give him her firstborn child and so he spins the straw into gold a final time (In some versions, the imp appears and begins to turn the straw into gold, paying no heed to the girl's protests that she has nothing to pay him with; when he finishes the task, he states that the price is her first child, and the horrified girl objects because she never agreed to this arrangement).

The king keeps his promise to marry the miller's daughter. But when their first child is born, the imp returns to claim his payment: "Now give me what you promised." She offers him all the wealth she has to keep the child, but the imp has no interest in her riches. 

He finally consents to give up his claim to the child if she can guess his name within three days (some versions have the imp limiting the number of daily guesses to three and hence the total number of guesses allowed to a maximum of nine). 

Her many guesses fail, but before the final night, she wanders into the woods (in some versions, she sends a servant into the woods instead of going herself in order to keep the king's suspicions at bay), searching for him and comes across his remote mountain cottage and watches, unseen, as he hops about his fire and sings. In his song's lyrics, "tonight tonight, my plans I make, tomorrow tomorrow, the baby I take. The queen will never win the game, for Rumpelstiltskin is my name'", he reveals his name.

When the imp comes to the queen on the third day, after first feigning ignorance, she reveals his name, Rumpelstiltskin, and he loses his temper and their bargain. Versions vary about whether he accuses the devil or witches of having revealed his name to the queen. In the 1812 edition of the Brothers Grimm tales, Rumpelstiltskin then "ran away angrily, and never came back". The ending was revised in an 1857 edition to a more gruesome ending wherein Rumpelstiltskin "in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two". Other versions have Rumpelstiltskin driving his right foot so far into the ground that he creates a chasm and falls into it, never to be seen again. In the oral version originally collected by the Brothers Grimm, Rumpelstiltskin flies out of the window on a cooking ladle.

==Name origins==
[[File:Rumpelstiltskin-Crane1886.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Illustration by Walter Crane from ''Household Stories by the Brothers Grimm'' (1886)]]

The name ''Rumpelstilzchen'' in [[German language|German]] means literally "little rattle stilt", a ''stilt'' being a post or pole that provides support for a structure. A ''rumpelstilt'' or ''rumpelstilz'' was consequently the name of a type of goblin, also called a ''pophart'' or ''poppart'', that makes noises by rattling posts and rapping on planks. The meaning is similar to ''rumpelgeist'' ("rattle ghost") or ''[[poltergeist]]'', a mischievous spirit that clatters and moves household objects. (Other related concepts are ''mummarts'' or ''[[boggart]]s'' and ''[[Hob (folklore)|hobs]]'', which are mischievous household spirits that disguise themselves.)  The ending ''-chen'' is a German diminutive cognate to English ''-kin''.

The earliest known mention of Rumpelstiltskin occurs in [[Johann Fischart]]'s ''Geschichtklitterung, or Gargantua'' of 1577 (a loose adaptation of [[François Rabelais|Rabelais']] ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'') which refers to an "amusement" for children, i.e. a children's game named "Rumpele stilt oder der Poppart".&lt;ref&gt;Wiktionary article on [[wikt:Rumpelstilzchen|''Rumpelstilzchen'']].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names used in translations==
[[File:The heart of oak books (1906) (14750176241).jpg|thumb|Illustration for the tale of "Rumpel-stilt-skin" from ''The heart of oak books'' (Boston 1910)]]

Translations of the original Grimm fairy tale (KHM 55) into various languages have generally substituted different names for the dwarf whose name is ''[[wikt:Rumpelstiltskin|Rumpelstilzchen]]''. For some languages, a name was chosen that comes close in sound to the German name: ''Rumpelstiltskin'' or ''Rumplestiltskin'' in English, ''Repelsteeltje'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Rumpelstichen'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Rumpelstinski'' or ''Rumpelestíjeles'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Rumplcimprcampr'' or ''Rampelník'' in [[Czech language|Czech]]. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]] it is called  ルンペルシュティルツキン (''Runperushutirutsukin''). [[Russian language|Russian]] might have the most accomplished imitation of the German name with Румпельшти́льцхен (''Rumpelʹštílʹcxen'').

In other languages the name was translated in a poetic and approximate way.

[[French language|French]] has&amp;nbsp;– besides other names&amp;nbsp;– ''Tracassin'' (like ''[[wikt:tracasser|tracasser]]'' "to pester"). In other translations an entirely different and generally meaningless name was selected, such as ''Barbichu'', ''Broumpristoche'', ''Grigrigredinmenufretin'', ''Outroupistache'' or ''Perlimpinpin'' in various translations to [[French language|French]]. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] translations use "Hariparibuşki Baripinpon" which does not mean anything and was chosen just because the name was complicated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[Slovak language|Slovak]] translations use ''Martinko Klingáč''.

For [[Hebrew]] the poet [[Avraham Shlonsky]] composed the name {{lang|he|עוץ לי גוץ לי}} (''Ootz-li Gootz-li'', a compact and rhymy touch to the original sentence and meaning of the story, "My adviser my midget"), when using the fairy tale as the basis of a children's [[musical theatre|musical]], now a classic among Hebrew children's plays. [[Greek language|Greek]] translations have used Ρουμπελστίλτσκιν (from the English) or Κουτσοκαλιγέρης (''Koutsokaliyéris'') which could figure as a Greek surname, formed with the particle κούτσο- (''koútso-'' "limping"), and is perhaps derived from the Hebrew name. [[Urdu]] versions of the tale used the name ''Tees Mar Khan'' for the imp.

Throughout the first seasons he concentrates on searching for his son, Baelfire. An expert on black magic and the dark arts (known as the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark One]]), this man has wizardly powers to make him a fair match for anyone in the land, even the [[Queen (Snow White)|Evil Queen]]. In the course of the series, he is also revealed to have taken on the role of Cinderella's fairy 'godmother', and is also essentially the [[Beast (Disney)|Beast]], falling in love with Belle after he demanded her as a price for saving her kingdom from a war.

He also acts as the crocodile, cutting off Captain Hook's hand after killing Milah, the mother of Baelfire, who left him when he was still a powerless coward. Eventually, Belle banishes him from Storybrooke when his own nature turns against him, prompting him to ally with various other villains to try and ensure their own happy endings. He is briefly purified of his darkness when it is revealed that he is dying of the dark magic in his heart, but despite Emma attempting to help him become a hero while she takes on the Dark One role, he eventually reclaims his powers, and he goes way too far from being a beast. In the sixth season, Rumplestiltskin's mother is revealed to be the Black Fairy, who had abandoned him and Malcolm after choosing power over love. In the same season, he has a son with Belle named Gideon. In season 7 he is on a quest to find the Guardian to rid him of his dark powers so he can be reunited with Belle. He gains the help of Alice. In the final episode, Rumplestiltskin sacrifices himself to defeat his evil Wish Realm counterpart and save Hook (who had a cursed heart) by giving Hook his heart, causing his Wish Realm counterpart to die too. Afterwards, Rumplestiltskin is reunited with Belle in the afterlife.

A '''[[satellite]] media tour (SMT)''' is a technique used by [[corporations]] (primarily) to provide an "expert" of their choosing to local [[television news]] [[broadcasts]] for often-live interaction, with the goal of getting out a specific message. Satellite media tours are related to, and often used in conjunction with, [[Video news release|Video News Releases]]. For example, a special version of a satellite media tour interview is often edited and distributed as a video news release, with the broadcaster adding in its own additional [[voice-over]]. Radio interviews are often booked during the satellite window to create a combo SMT/RMT. Co-op Satellite media tours, a common form, use one expert to make recommendations funded by more than one client, all under one category (e.g. "Four Great Ideas for Cleaning Your Bathroom").

Examples of satellite media tours:  http://pitchingmonkeysmedia.com/satellite-media-tours/&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pitchingmonkeysmedia.com/satellite-media-tours/|title=Satellite Media Tours (SMTs)|work=Pitching Monkeys Media|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serbian Citation Index''' ({{lang-sr|Srpski citatni indeks}}; '''SCIndeks''') is a combination of an online multidisciplinary [[bibliographic database]], a national [[citation index]], an [[Open Access]] full-text [[Academic journal|journal]] repository and an [[electronic publishing]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| volume = 2| pages = 710–711| last = Šipka| first = Pero| title = The Serbian Citation Index: Context and content| booktitle = Proceedings of ISSI 2005 - the 10 th  International Conference of the Information Society  for Scientometrics and Informetrics, Stockholm, Sweden, July 24-28, 2005| location = Stockholm| accessdate = 2016-08-08| date = 2005| url = https://www.ceon.rs/images/pdf/Sipka_SCIndeks_proceedings.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced and maintained by the Centre for Evaluation in Education and Science (CEON/CEES), based in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. In July 2017, it indexed 230 Serbian [[Scholarly journals|scholarly journals]] in all areas of science and contained more than 80,000 [[Bibliographic record|bibliographic records]] and more than one million bibliographic references. 

SCIndeks operates as a [[Digital object identifier|DOI]] registration agency and an [[OAI-PMH]] data provider.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Home page| work = SCIndeks| accessdate = 2017-07-31| url = http://scindeks.ceon.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development#OpenAIRE|OpenAIRE]] data provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Data providers: SCIndeks - Serbian Citation Index| work = OpenAIRE| accessdate = 2017-08-01| url = https://www.openaire.eu/search/dataprovider?datasourceId=openaire____::63bd442fa8afe33f788fc510cfcf08d4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian Citation Inde is a member of the [[Committee on Publication Ethics]] (COPE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = SCIndeks: The Serbian Citation Index| work = Committee on Publication Ethics: COPE| accessdate = 2017-08-03| url = https://publicationethics.org/members/scindeks-serbian-citation-index}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Features ==
While the content of SCIndeks is freely available to users, the publishers of the indexed journals subscribe to one of four service packages that provide various levels of content indexing and [[quality control]]: from basic bibliographic data (no full text) to full-text availability, DOI assignment, bibliometric evaluation, journal management support and plagiarism detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Funkcionalnosti/Paketi| work = SCIndeks: Srpski citatni indeks| accessdate = 2017-07-31| date = 2015| url = http://scindeks-repozitorijum.ceon.rs/Paketi.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The core of SCIndeks is a searchable bibliographic database that also contains [[citation]] information. It relies on a full text repository (SCIndeks Repository). The repository and journal profiles are maintained through the Editor Service, a [[Front and back ends|back-end]] platform for journal [[Editor|editors]]. Publishers may also subscribe to SCIndeks Assistant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Fakultet informacionih tehnologija| pages = 95–98| editors = Đuro Kutlača (ed.)| last1 = Stanić| first1 = Nikola| last2 = Sotirović| first2 = Miša| title = Sistem elektronskog uređivanja domaćih časopisa referisanih u Srpskom citatnom indeksu| booktitle = Naučnostručni skup Sistem naučnih, tehnoloških i poslovnih informacija u Srbiji - SNTPI| location = Beograd| date = 2009 |url = https://www.ceon.rs/images/pdf/stanic_sotirovic.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; a journal management system based on [[Open Journal Systems]] and enriched with a number of in-house developed services, tools and protocols that enable the [[Database normalization|normalization]] of names, affiliations and funding information; automated [[parsing]] and formatting of references; matching of references and citations; keywords assignment, etc. SCIndeks Assistant also enables [[plagiarism detection]] through [[CrossRef]] Similarity Check, using [[iThenticate]].&lt;ref name="home"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = About SCIndeks: Content and features| work = SCIndeks: Serbian Citation Index| accessdate = 2017-07-31| url = http://scindeks.ceon.rs/static/about.aspx?url=content.htm}}; {{Cite web| title = About SCIndeks: Quality control| work = SCIndeks: Serbian Citation Index| accessdate = 2017-07-31| url = http://scindeks.ceon.rs/static/about.aspx?url=qualitycontrol.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inter"&gt;{{Cite conference| conference = Third International Conference on Open Repositories 2008| last1 = Šipka| first1 = Pero| last2 = Kosanović| first2 = Biljana| title = The national citation index as a platform to achieve interoperability of a national journals repository| location = Southampton, United Kingdom| accessdate = 2015-07-24| date = 2008| url = https://www.ceon.rs/images/pdf/the_national_citation_index_2008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bibliometrics|Bibliometric data]] contained in SCindeks are used to generate cumulative annual reports on the performance of the indexed journals – Journal Bibliometric Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = JBR – Journal Bibliometric Report| work = CEON/CEES - Centre for Evaluation in Education and Science| accessdate = 2017-07-31| url = https://bic.ceon.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tracks more than 20 quantitative and qualitative indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Bibliometric performance indicators| work = SCIndeks Help| accessdate = 2017-07-31| url = http://scindeks.ceon.rs/help/en/indicators.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

SCindeks offers a number of functionalities to registered users, e.g. customized search and saved search alerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = What is MySCIndeks?| work = SCIndeks Help| accessdate = 2017-07-31| url = http://scindeks.ceon.rs/help/en/myscindeks.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and history ==
The development of SCIndeks was preceded by two projects: SocioFakt Online (a citation database for [[social sciences]], established in 2001) and SocioFakt Open Access (a fully searchable and harvestable full-text journal repository, established in 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Narodna biblioteka Srbije| isbn = 86-7035-146-3| pages = 35–41| editors = Đuro Kutlača (ed.)| last = Šipka| first = Pero| title = Integracija sistema naučnih informacija u nacionalnoj ravni: povezivanje citatnog indeksa s bazom tekućih projekata| booktitle = Naučnostručni skup SNTPI '06 Sistem naučno-tehničkih i poslovnih informacija| location = Beograd| date = 2006| url = https://www.ceon.rs/images/pdf/Sipka_SNTPI_2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = About SocioFakt| work = SocioFakt| accessdate = 2016-08-08| date = 2006-06-29| url = http://nainfo.nbs.bg.ac.yu/sfoa/osf.php?je=en| deadurl = bot: unknown| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060629205711/http://nainfo.nbs.bg.ac.yu/sfoa/osf.php?je=en| archivedate = 2006-06-29| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both databases were developed by the CEON/CEES. SCIndeks draws on both projects but it covers all areas of science. 

From the outset, SCIndeks was used as the source of information for the evaluation of locally published journals,&lt;ref name="inter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Department of Information Sciences. Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb| isbn = 978-953-175-408-8| pages = 43–49| last1 = Popovic| first1 = Aleksandra| last2 = Antonic| first2 = Sanja| last3 = Stolic| first3 = Dragana| title = The Role of National Citation Index in the Evaluation of National Science| booktitle = 3rd International Conference The Future of Information Sciences (INFuture) INFuture2011: “Information Sciences and e-Society| location = Zagreb| date = 2011 |url=http://infoz.ffzg.hr/bookstore/files/INFuture2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the Journal Bibliometric Report, a local counterpart of the [[Journal Citation Reports]]. 

SCIndeks was originally funded by the Ministry of Science of the Republic of Serbia, which means that indexing and bibliometric analyses were free for journals.&lt;ref name="inter"/&gt; Under this model, nearly 500 journals were covered and nearly 40% of papers were available as full text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Časopisi| work = SCIndeks| accessdate = 2016-02-08| date = 2015-02-07| url = https://scindeks.ceon.rs/Journals.aspx| deadurl = bot: unknown| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150207221933/http://scindeks.ceon.rs/Journals.aspx| archivedate = 2015-02-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development ceased supporting SCIndeks. Consequently, SCIndeks changed the business model: it was no longer available free of charge to journal publishers interested in indexing and evaluation of their journals, while remaining freely available to readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = CEON| title = SCIndeks promenio oblik, obim i način finansiranja: saopštenje CEON-a| work = Centar za evaluaciju u obrazovanju i nauci - CEON| accessdate = 2017-01-07| date = 2015-03-05| url = https://www.ceon.rs/images/pdf/saopstenje_CEON-a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016-2017, SCIndeks was upgraded to enable [[ORCID]] integration and normalization of funder information. It was also made compatible with [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development#OpenAIRE|OpenAIRE]].&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Centre for Evaluation in Education and Science| pages = 4| last = Šipka| first = Pero,| title = Supporting SCIndeks Improvements through Alternative Funding Mechanism: CEON/CEES Project Execution Final Report| date = 2017-03-06 |url=https://www.ceon.rs/images/pdf/Alternative_Funding_Mechanism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Policy and [[Licensing]] Support Service was introduced in the Editor Service.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; It enables journals to define their editorial policies relying on a standardized template, which fully conforms to the requirements set by the [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] (DOAJ) in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kosanović| first = Biljana| title = Open Access publishing in Serbia and Western Balkan Open Science| work = Working Group : OpenAIRE blog| accessdate = 2017-08-01| url = https://blogs.openaire.eu/?p=2168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spirit of Metal webzine''' is an online collection of bands from [[Heavy metal music|Heavy Metal]] and its [[subgenre]]s. ''SoM'' is similar to the ''[[Encyclopaedia Metallum]]''. The difference between the two online collection portals is that ''Spirit of Metal'' also included in its encyclopedia bands that have their roots in [[Hardcore Punk]].
The site originated in [[France]].

Since the founding of the website in 2003, Spirit of Metal is available in 9 languages ([[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]).

In addition to the tape archive, Spirit of Metal acts as a messaging service. So band messages are added, interviews conducted, concert and album reviews published, which are corrected by the professional staff and published thereafter. Interviews, reviews and news are published in French or English. Spirit of Metal also sells its own T-shirts. Many well-known musicians from world-renowned groups, including [[Sharon den Adel|Sharon Janny den Adel]] ([[Within Temptation]]), [[Edu Falaschi]] ([[Angra (band)|Angra]]), [[Janne Wirman]] ([[Children of Bodom]]), [[Dani Filth]] ([[Cradle of Filth]]), [[Simone Simons]] ([[Epica (band)|Epica]]) and [[Mikael Stanne]] ([[Dark Tranquillity]])&lt;ref&gt;Spirit of Metal: [http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/vente/shirts-l-en.html SoM -Shirts]&lt;/ref&gt; Members have the opportunity to discuss bands and other topics in the forum, and can send private messages outside the forum.

Another difference with the Metal Archives is that, for some time now,  bands with a questionable political [[ideology]] cannot be added to ''Spirit of Metal''. Politically-oriented bands (especially [[Right-Wing|extreme right-wing]] groups) that were registered prior to this control measure are marked with a crossed [[swastika]].

In addition, Spirit of Metal is comparable to portals such as [[Vampster]] and [[Powermetal.de]]. Since 2003 there is also a portal that specializes in rock bands. This is called '''Spirit of Rock webzine'''. According to the official [[Facebook]] presence of the music archive, ''Spirit of Metal'' represents the world's largest online encyclopedia of Metal and rock.

'''[[Saint Teilo|St Teilo]]'s Church''' is a historic building originally located at Llandeilo Tal-y-Bont near [[Pontarddulais]] and now reconstructed at [[St Fagans National History Museum]] in [[Cardiff]], Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Teilo's Church|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/stfagans/buildings/st_teilos_church/|website=Museum Wales|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The church is thought to have been built in the 12th or 13th century. It was used regularly until 1850, subsequently used only for a few services during the summer months.&lt;ref name="BBC church opens"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/7043147.stm BBC News – South-East Wales: "Archbishop opens medieval church", 14 October 2007]. Accessed 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As recently as the early 20th century, [[coracle]]s were used by worshippers to reach the church in its location beside the [[River Loughor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://welshjournals.llgc.org.uk/browse/viewpage/llgc-id:1272866/llgc-id:1272920/llgc-id:1272962/getText "Llandeilo Talybont", ''Gower'', Vol 2 (1949), p37ff]. Accessed 27 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It went out of use in 1970&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icon.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=601&amp;Itemid=16 Institute of Conservation: "Wales 'Not a backwater'"]. Accessed 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and began to be demolished in 1984 in readiness for the move to [[St Fagans]]. 

Prior to the removal of the church, wall paintings were discovered showing through in places beneath the plaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/1240 National Museum of Wales: St Teilo's Church – The Story of the Murals]. Accessed 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  When the church began to be dismantled, the paintings were first removed and preserved; the oldest of them was a mural of [[Catherine of Alexandria|St Catherine]], believed to date from the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/medieval-wall-paintings/medieval-wall-paintings.htm www.buildingconservation.com Tom Organ, "Reviving a Lost Art"]. Accessed 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction===
It was rebuilt and redecorated as it would have appeared in about 1530. The new roof timbers were sourced from Northeast Wales and a new rood screen and a loft were carved from [[Radnorshire]] [[oak]] by the project's head carpenter, Ray Smith MBE.&lt;ref name="BBC church opens" /&gt; 

The missing sections of the wall paintings were reconstructed from what was left. Around one-third of the paintings now displayed are reconstructions of those discovered under the wall-plaster, the originals having been preserved and held by the [[National Museum of Wales]].  The remainder were devised by experts, based on paintings known from other churches.  One of the original paintings represented the Holy Trinity, with God the Father seated in majesty behind a crucifix.  The head of the king is believed to be modelled on King [[Henry VIII of England]], a theory supported by a representation on the opposite wall of Henry's seal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/1206/?image=4682 St Fagan's National History Museum – St Teilo's Church Reconstruction Project: Wall Paintings]. Accessed 29 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The church was the 41st building to be opened to the public at the museum. It was officially reopened by the then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Dr [[Rowan Williams]], in 2007.&lt;ref name="BBC church opens" /&gt;

'''''Stick and Rudder: An Explanation of the Art of Flying''''' ({{ISBN|978-0-07-036240-6}}) is a book written in 1944 by [[Wolfgang Langewiesche]], describing how airplanes fly and how they should be flown by pilots.  It has become a standard reference text for aviators.  Written well before the proliferation of cockpit electronics, navigational aids, and air traffic control radio, the book focuses primarily on fundamental skills specific to flying the aircraft in its stripped down basic form.

'''''The Encyclopaedia of Sexual Knowledge''''', under the editorship of Dr. [[Norman Haire]] (1892&amp;ndash;1952), is the first of a trilogy of sexual encyclopaedias by [[Arthur Koestler]] writing under the pen name of ‘Dr. A. Costler’. It is the English version, published by Koestler's cousin Francis Aldor in 1934, of the book ''L'encyclopédie de la vie sexuelle'' that Koestler in 1933 wrote, together with "A. Willy" (the pseudonym of his other cousin Willy Aldor) and the German Dr. Levy-Lenz. The second book is ''[[Sexual Anomalies and Perversions, Physical and Psychological Development, Diagnoses and Treatment]]''. The title of the third book is, in the original French edition of 1939, ''[[L’Encyclopédie de la famille]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Koestler: ''The Invisible Writing'' pp. 260–61&lt;/ref&gt; This third book was subsequently translated into English and published under various titles and with changes to the structure and text of the original edition. The name of ‘Dr. Costler’ (or 'A. Coester') as the author or co-author of the book is omitted from later editions.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''The Encyclopaedia of Sex Practice'', Second Edition, by Drs. [[Norman Haire]], A. Willy, L. Vander, O. Fischer, R. Lothar and others, London: Encyclopaedic Press Ltd., 1951, 836 pages. See also the interesting study of Michael Scammell, ''Koestler. The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth-Century Skeptic'', Random House, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The first book contained chapters by two other authors; the second I wrote alone; the third contained chapters by [[Manès Sperber]] (who had been a practising Psychotherapist before he made his reputation as a novelist).&lt;ref&gt;''The Invisible Writing'', footnote pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Koestler wrote that working from standard text books and reference works "I condensed and distilled the ''Encyclopædia'' at a rate of about four thousand words a day."&lt;ref&gt;''The Invisible Wring'', p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

The background to Koestler’s collaboration in the writing of these books is set out in detail in his autobiography ''[[The Invisible Writing]]'', Chapter XIX. ‘Introducing Dr. Coster’. As noted there, The Encyclopœdia was highly successful and became a best-seller in several languages, but Koestler himself had little benefit of it, being shamelessly exploited by the publisher &amp;ndash; a crooked cousin of his. Koestler received a flat payment of sixty pounds and no royalties from the sales, which amounted to tens of thousands. 

== Contents ==
The book is divided into ten ‘Books’ (main chapters) and two Appendices. Each ‘Book’ consists of several Sections and Chapters. The book contains numerous monochrome illustrations and 32 colour plates. 836 numbered pages.

The '''Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement''' ({{lang-es|Movimiento Revolucionario Túpac Amaru}}, abbreviated '''MRTA''') was a [[Peruvian]] Marxist guerrilla group which started in the early 1980s. The group was led by [[Víctor Polay|Víctor Polay Campos]] until he was sentenced to 32 years' imprisonment in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Corte Suprema incrementa condenas a Víctor Polay y a cúpula del MRTA |url=http://www.elcomercio.com.pe/ediciononline/HTML/2008-06-24/corte-suprema-incrementa-condenas-victor-polay-y-cupula-mrta.html |work=[[El Comercio (Perú)|El Comercio]] |publisher= |location= |trans-title=|page= |pages= |language=spanish |doi= |date=24 June 2008 |month= |year= |quote= |accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Néstor Cerpa Cartolini]] ("Comrade Evaristo") until his death in 1997.

The MRTA took its name in homage to [[Túpac Amaru II]], an 18th-century rebel leader who was himself named after his claimed ancestor [[Túpac Amaru]], the last indigenous leader of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] people. MRTA was designated a [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization by the [[Politics of Peru|Peruvian government]], the US Department of State and the European Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |author=US Department of State |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Terrorism 2006 - Peru |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4681088023.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209122006/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4681088023.html|work= |publisher= |location= |trans-title=|page= |pages= |language= |doi= |date= |month= |year= |archivedate=2011-12-09|quote= |dead-url=yes|accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=|last=|author=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=MRTA será incluido en la lista de terroristas|url=http://www.elcomercio.com.pe/impresa/notas/mrta-incluido-lista-terroristas/20090508/283759|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406181205/http://www.elcomercio.com.pe/impresa/notas/mrta%2Dincluido%2Dlista%2Dterroristas/20090508/283759|work=[[El Comercio (Perú)|El Comercio]]|publisher=|location=|trans-title=|page=|pages=|language=spanish|doi=|date=8 May 2009|month=|year=|archivedate=2012-04-06|quote=|dead-url=yes|accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later removed from the [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]] on October 8, 2001.

At the height of its strength, the movement had several hundred active members. Its stated goals were to establish a [[socialist state]] and rid the country of all "[[Imperialism|imperialist]]" elements.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) |url=http://www.nps.edu/library/Research/SubjectGuides/SpecialTopics/TerroristProfile/Prior/TupacAmaruRevolutionaryMovement.html |work=Patterns of Global Terrorism, 2000 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |date=April 2001 |accessdate=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The MRTA originated in 1980 from the merging of the [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (Marxist-Leninist)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]] and the militant faction of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Peru)|Revolutionary Left Movement]], ''MIR El Militante'' (MIR-EM).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The former gathered several ex-members of the [[Peruvian armed forces]] that participated in the [[leftist]] government of [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] (1968–1975), and the latter represented a subdivision of the Revolutionary Left Movement, a [[Fidel Castro|Castro]]ist guerrilla faction which was defeated in 1965.
The MRTA attempted to ally with other leftist organizations following the first democratic elections in Peru after a military government period (1968–1980).

==Operations==
The first action by the MRTA occurred on 31 May 1982, when five of its members, including [[Victor Polay|Victor Polay Campos]] and Jorge Talledo Feria (members of the Central Committee) robbed a bank in La Victoria, Lima. During the hold up, Talledo was killed by friendly fire.

&lt;!--On 31 May 1989, a group of six guerrillas shot dead eight [[Transvestism|transvestites]] and [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] in a bar in the city of [[Tarapoto]]. The weekly "Cambio", official organ of the MRTA, claimed responsibility, accusing the police of protecting "these social ills, which were used to corrupt youth." This was reported by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in its final report (August 28, 2003). The date has been considered by the Peruvian LGBT movement as a historical landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.globalgayz.com/south-america/peru/gay-peru-news-and-reports-2011/#article2 |title=Gay Peru News &amp; Reports 2011 |publisher=Archive.globalgayz.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; 
Peru's counterterrorist program diminished the group's ability to carry out terrorist attacks, and the MRTA suffered from infighting as well as violent clashes with [[Maoist]] rival [[Shining Path]], the imprisonment or deaths of senior leaders, and loss of leftist support. ln 2001, several MRTA members remained imprisoned in [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt;

On 6 July 1992, MRTA fighters staged a raid on the town of Jaen, Peru, a jungle town located in the northern department of Cajamarca. One policeman, Eladio Garcia Tello, responded to the calls for help. After an intense shootout, the guerrillas were driven out of the town. Eladio Garcia perished in the firefight.

Its last major action resulted in the 1997 [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]]. In December 1996, 14 MRTA members occupied the Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima, holding 72 hostages for more than four months. Under orders from then-President [[Alberto Fujimori]], armed forces stormed the residence in April 1997, rescuing all but one of the remaining hostages and killing all 14 MRTA militants. Fujimori was publicly acclaimed for the decisive action, but the affair was later tainted by subsequent revelations that at least three, and perhaps as many as eight, of the MRTistas were summarily executed after they surrendered.

==Trials and convictions==
In a case that attracted international attention, [[Lori Berenson]], a former [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] student and [[United States|U.S.]] [[Socialism|socialist]] activist living in Lima, was arrested on 30 November 1995, by the  police and accused of collaborating with the MRTA. She was subsequently sentenced by a military court to life imprisonment (later reduced to 20 years by a civilian court).

In September 2003, four [[Chile]]an defendants including [[Jaime Castillo Petruzzi]] were retried and convicted of membership in the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement and participation in an attack on the Peru&amp;ndash;North American Cultural Institute and a kidnapping-murder in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larepublica.pe/03-09-2003/tras-nuevo-juicio-los-4-chilenos-del-mrta-continuaran-en-la-carcel |title=Tras nuevo juicio - los 4 chilenos del MRTA continuarán en la cárcel |publisher=LaRepublica.pe |date=2013-04-07 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2006, [[Víctor Polay]], the guerrilla leader of the MRTA, was found guilty by a Peruvian court on nearly 30 crimes committed during the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]].  "Peru Guerrilla Leader Convicted." 22 March 2006.  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4832034.stm Available online].  Accessed 3 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Truth and Reconciliation Commission==
Peru's [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] determined that the group was responsible for 1.5% of the deaths investigated. In its final findings published in 2003, the Commission observed:

:''Unlike Shining Path, and like other armed Latin American organizations with which it maintained ties, the MRTA claimed responsibility for its actions, its members used uniforms or other identifiers to differentiate themselves from the civilian population, it abstained from attacking the unarmed population and at some points showed signs of being open to peace negotiations. Nevertheless, MRTA also engaged in criminal acts; it resorted to assassinations, such as in the case of General Enrique López Albújar, the taking of hostages and the systematic practice of kidnapping, all crimes that violate not only personal liberty but the international humanitarian law that the MRTA claimed to respect.''&lt;ref&gt;La Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación.  ''Final Report.''  "General Conclusions." [http://www.cverdad.org.pe/ingles/ifinal/conclusiones.php Available online].  Accessed 3 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2591">'''Uzbekisation''' or '''Uzbekization''' is the process of something or someone culturally non-Uzbek becoming, or being forced to become, [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], though it is a racial designation.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The term is often used to describe the process by which the region now occupied by [[Tajikistan]] was incorporated as an autonomous republic ([[Tajik ASSR]]) within the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]] between 1924 and 1929.

The term "Uzbekization" is also used to refer to the cultural assimilation of the [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] in Uzbekistan. Because of assimilation pressures that began in 1924 with the creation of [[Uzbek SSR]], ethnic Tajiks often chose to identify themselves as Uzbeks in population census forms and preferred to be registered as Uzbek in their passports to avoid leaving the republic for the less developed agricultural and mountainous Tajikistan.&lt;ref&gt;Rahim Masov, ''The History of the Clumsy Delimitation'', Irfon Publ.

[[Iraj Bashiri]], 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; While official Uzbek statistics place the total Tajik population in Uzbekistan at about 5%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.umid.uz/Main/Uzbekistan/Population/population.html |title=Results of population censuses in Uzbekistan in 1959, 1970, 1979, and 1989. |access-date=2008-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620072910/http://www.umid.uz/Main/Uzbekistan/Population/population.html |archive-date=2008-06-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uz.html#People CIA World Factbook: Uzbekistan] (1996 est.)&lt;/ref&gt; subjective expert estimates suggest that the Tajiks may account for as much as 25%-30% of the total population of the country.&lt;ref name=Foltz&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], "The Tajiks of Uzbekistan", ''Central Asian Survey'', 15(2), 213-216 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the term "Uzbekization" has been applied to the processes in [[Uzbekistan]] that reverse the results of [[Sovietization]] and [[Russification]]. Among these are restoring the importance of [[Uzbek language]], which replaced the Russian language in obligatory education, promotion of Uzbek tradition and culture.

'''William Henry Stevenson''' (7 September 1858 – 22 October 1924), who wrote as '''W. H. Stevenson''', was an [[English people|English]] historian and philologist who specialized in [[Anglo-Saxon England]].

Stevenson was born in [[Nottingham]] and went to school in Hull. As a young man he was a researcher for the Nottingham Borough Council and became a contributor to the ''[[English Historical Review]]''. Having worked for many years on early [[charter]]s, in May 1898 Stephenson delivered the Sandars Lectures at Cambridge on the subject of 'The Anglo-Saxon Chancery'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kemble.asnc.cam.ac.uk/node/41 W. H. Stevenson] at kemble.asnc.cam.ac.uk, accessed 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

A pioneer of Anglo-Saxon studies, Stevenson's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' was his edition of [[Asser]]'s ''Life of King Alfred'', published in 1904, and in the sixteen years between 1892 and 1908 he edited for the [[Public Record Office]] eleven volumes of calendars of [[Close Rolls]].&lt;ref name=poole&gt;A. L. Poole, 'William Henry Stevenson', in ''Dictionary of National Biography, 1922–1930'' (Oxford, 1937), pp. 811–812&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[Fellow]] and librarian of [[St John's College, Oxford]] from 1904 until his death, he was the mentor of [[Frank Stenton]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lapidge, ''Interpreters of Early Medieval Britain'' (2002), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archie Burnett, ed., ''The Letters of A. E. Housman'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KDn58Jqn94wC&amp;pg=PA625#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 625]&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of Stevenson's greatest strengths was a faultless knowledge of the important languages of his period.&lt;ref name=poole/&gt;

==A discovery regarding Shakespeare==
In 1905, while working on records kept at [[Belvoir Castle]], Stevenson discovered evidence that in March 1613 (a few months before the Globe theatre burnt down during a performance of [[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]), [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Richard Burbage]], who had some skill as a portrait painter, were each paid forty-four shillings in gold for creating and painting the [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland|Earl of Rutland]]’s emblem.  This decorative emblem was to be used at a festive tournament later that month at [[Whitehall]] in London to mark the accession of [[James VI and I|King James I]] ten years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SXFlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA455&amp;lpg=PA455&amp;dq=%22belvoir+castle%22+shakespeare&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z9CVdq1_EO&amp;sig=IpqVdDV2bPZyogERuEb8qqvx5tY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBGoVChMI0uOqkrPixgIVBmg-Ch18fw9F#v=onepage&amp;q=%22belvoir%20castle%22%20shakespeare&amp;f=false] Lee, Sidney.

'''''Western Australia: An Atlas of Human Endeavour''''' was an atlas published in 1979 as part of the [[WAY 79]] sesquicentennial celebration of the European colonisation of Western Australia. It was published by the Western Australian Department of Education and the Department of Lands and Surveys, and had a [[foreword]] by Premier [[Charles Court]], who was personally involved in a number of the projects that were conducted by the organisation.{{cn|date=January 2017|reason=See [[Talk:Charles Court#WAY 79]]}}

It was an atlas that included extensive usage of historical geography, and both editions included gazetteers and bibliographies - at some divergence from the [[Sesquicentenary Celebrations Series]] editions that lacked indexes and adequate reference materials.

It was originally published for the 1979 celebrations; a second edition that dropped the dates in the title, was published in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/result?q=Western+Australia+atlas+endeavour Trove details of availability and variations between available editions&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb''' is a [[Druze]] festival called [[Ziyara]] celebrated between 25 and 28 April which is officially recognized in [[Israel]] as a public holiday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druzehistoryandculture.com/historical_sites.htm Druze Revered Sites in Palestine: Jethro's Tomb]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kais Firro|title=The Druzes in the Jewish State: A Brief History|date=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004112510|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holiday==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1336 Druze Scouts צופים דרוזים בקבר יתרו.jpg|thumb|260px|Druze scouts visiting the tomb during the [[Ziyara]]]]

The [[Druze]] generally only celebrate one holiday, [[Eid al-Adha]]. The [[Israeli Druze|Druze community in Israel]] under the leadership of Sheikh [[Amin Tarif]], however, has endowed this period with a special status, deeming the Ziyara a festive day by law. Workers are allowed to take a break from work without infringing their workers' rights. Schools operating under the Druze education system are closed for the period, while Druze soldiers in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] are also given the period as a vacation.The whole community, not just religious Druze in Israel, celebrates this Ziyara.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Celebrations==
The celebration starts on 25 April and concludes on 28 April, with many religious leaders from all the religions in [[Religion in Israel|Israel]], and also political leaders (occasionally also the PM), coming to congratulate the Israeli Druze community during their festivities at the [[Maqam (shrine)|Maqam]] al-[[Nabi Shu'ayb]]. Religious leaders or sheikhs from [[Mount Carmel]], the [[Galilee]] and the [[Golan Heights]] take the opportunity to discuss religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druzehistoryandculture.com/historical_sites.htm Druze Revered Sites in Palestine: Jethro's Tomb]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kais Firro|title=The Druzes in the Jewish State: A Brief History|date=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004112510|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visits of Druze from Syria, Lebanon and Jordan during Ziyaras==
* Since 1968, [[Druze]] from the [[Golan Heights]] can freely visit the shrine and they are also involved in the feast.
* Other Syrian Druze outside the Golan never used to be involved at the celebrations.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
* Lebanese Druze rarely visited the shrine, but in 1982 a group from Lebanon, during the Israeli occupation of the south, answered the call of Sheikh Amin Tarif to visit. 
* Following the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]] in 1994, Jordanian Druze are permitted to visit the shrine throughout the year, and their visits are not restricted to the festive period.
