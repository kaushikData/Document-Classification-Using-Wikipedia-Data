In 1964 there was an outbreak of [[typhoid]] in the city of [[Aberdeen]], Scotland. The first two cases were identified on 20 May 1964; eventually over 400 cases were diagnosed and the patients were quarantined at the City Hospital in Urquhart Road and Woodend Hospital in Eday Road, but no fatalities resulted. Dr Ian MacQueen, the [[Medical Officer of Health]] for Aberdeen, became well known in the media for his twice-daily briefings.&lt;ref name=BBC2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nicolson|first1=Stuart|title=Typhoid left city 'under siege'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/7471198.stm|accessdate=18 November 2014|work=BBC Scotland News|date=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FoodPanics&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=D. F.|title=Food panics in history: corned beef, typhoid and "risk society"|journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health|date=1 July 2007|volume=61|issue=7|pages=566–570|doi=10.1136/jech.2006.046417|pmc=2465752|pmid=17568045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak was eventually traced to contaminated tinned [[corned beef]] from South America made by [[Fray Bentos (food brand)|Fray Bentos]] and sold in the city's branch of the Scottish grocery chain [[William Low]]. Pollution from the waters of the [[Uruguay River]]  (which flows into the [[Río de la Plata]]) appeared to be the source of the contamination, probably through water entering a defective tin through a small puncture. The infected meat then contaminated a meat slicing machine within the William Low shop, leading to the spread of the disease.

==Aftermath==
The reputation of Aberdeen as a safe city to visit, live in and work in was briefly harmed by the media coverage of the outbreak. In July 1964, following the end of the outbreak, the Queen made a high-profile visit to boost morale and to help rehabilitate the city's reputation.

An official enquiry and report into the outbreak was commissioned by the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. The enquiry was headed by Sir David Milne and his published findings became known as the Milne Report.

The reputation of William Low was irrevocably damaged within Aberdeen and the city's store, the source of the outbreak, closed three years later. Dundee-based William Low subsequently opened many other stores around Scotland but remained absent from Aberdeen. William Low was taken over by [[Tesco]] in 1994. Public perceptions of the safety of Fray Bentos tinned meats also contributed to significantly diminished income.

The outbreak was successfully handled, given the absence of fatalities. The outbreak drew attention to the need for better standards of hygiene, notably in the cleaning of food processing machinery. The [[University of Aberdeen]] went to on to develop an international reputation in the field of disease control, notably in the appointment of Professor [[Hugh Pennington]] to the post of Professor of Bacteriology from 1979 until his retirement in 2003.

The typhoid outbreak may have encouraged replacement of traditional laundered roller towels in public toilets, which allowed bacterial cross-infection from person to person, by disposable paper towels and warm air hand driers.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[File:TOMS indonesia smog lrg.jpg|thumb|350px|Air pollution over Southeast Asia in October 1997.]]
The '''1997 group of [[forest fire]]s in [[Indonesia]]''' that lasted well into 1998 were probably among the two or three, if not ''the'' largest, forest fires group in the last two centuries of recorded history.

In the middle of 1997 forest fires burning in Indonesia began to affect neighbouring countries, spreading thick clouds of smoke and haze to [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. Then Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] searched desperately for a solution,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19971108&amp;id=cLBOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MRUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5399,1353 New Straits Times - Nov 8, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; and based on a plan by the head of the Malaysian fire and rescue department sent a team of Malaysian firefighters across to Indonesia under code name [[Operation Haze]]. This is to mitigate the effect of the Haze to Malaysia economy. The value of the Haze damage to Malaysian GDP is estimated to be 0.30 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eMBu_rXSq3QC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=operation+haze+malaysia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IOY8RfxPyk&amp;sig=kXuKaptYi5e1PUzEYjv_IZjfhnU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VQp3T5_nHMHirAfioMSuDQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=operation%20haze%20malaysia&amp;f=false Indonesia's Fires and Haze: The Cost of Catastrophe  By David Glover, Timothy Jessup, page 46]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seasonal rains in early December brought a brief respite but soon after the dry conditions and fires returned. By 1998 [[Brunei]] and to a lesser extent [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]] and the [[Philippines]] had also felt the haze from the [[smoke]] of the forest fires. By the time the 1997-98 forest fires were finally over some 8 million hectares of land had burned while countless millions of people suffered from air pollution.

== Causes and effect ==
The 1997 Indonesian forest fires were caused by changing land use which made the tropical forest vulnerable to fire during a drought associated with that year's [[El Niño]]. Indonesian forests have historically been resistant to burning even during long dry seasons and despite the use of fire to clear land for [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture. The land use changes that led to the fires were a combination of industrial-scale logging, draining peatlands for conversion to oil palm and fast-growing tree plantations, and a massive government program to drain swamps and convert them to rice paddies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Why_Forests_Why_Now.html?id=WWx6rgEACAAJ|title=Why Forests? Why Now?: The Science, Economics, and Politics of Tropical Forests and Climate Change|last=Seymour|first=Frances|last2=Busch|first2=Jonah|date=2016|publisher=Center for Global Development|year=|isbn=9781933286853|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 240 people perished in the wildfires.&lt;ref name="Worst Wildfires"&gt;{{cite web |title=Capter 3 It Only Takes A Spark: The Hazard of Wildfires |url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ND-Review-Chapter-3.pdf |publisher=Brookings.edu |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimated cost ==
The total economic value of the damages are conservatively estimated to be US$4.47 billion, of which by far the largest share was borne by Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=eMBu_rXSq3QC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=1997+indonesia+forest+fire+causes&amp;ots=IQXaWoxOuq&amp;sig=x0CIVO5azr4Wj0hSzuBBGrdBTSg#v=onepage&amp;q=1997%20indonesia%20forest%20fire%20causes&amp;f=false|title=Indonesia's Fires and Haze: The Cost of Catastrophe|last=Glover|first=David|date=2006|publisher=IDRC|isbn=9781552503324|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure excludes a number of damages that are especially difficult to measure or to value in monetary terms, such as loss of human life, long term health impacts, and some biodiversity losses.

Forest fires in Indonesia in 1997 were estimated to have released between 0.81 and 2.57 gigatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, which is between 13-40% of the annual [[carbon dioxide]] emissions from burning [[fossil fuels]].,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://climate.ncas.ac.uk/people/allan/Seasonal_Forecasting_papers/harrison_09_global_impact_indonesian_forest_fires.pdf The global impact of Indonesian forest fires]'', Mark E Harrison, Susan E Page, and Suwido H Limin, [[Biologist]], Volume 56 Number 3, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.monitor.net/monitor/0211a/rainfire2.html Indonesia Rainforest Fires Doubled CO2 Levels Globally]'', Cat Lazaroff, [[Albion Monitor]], 5 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of steps taken to avoid the recurring of the Haze, the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) approved the need for an early warning system in the Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP) in 1998 to prevent forest fires and the resulting haze through improved management policies and enforcements, example via Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wamis.org/agm/meetings/wofire08/S2-Zaki_Malaysia.pdf OPERATIONAL FDR IN MALAYSIA AND ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIA NATIONS]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7008">An '''aging-associated disease''' is a [[disease]] that is most often seen with increasing frequency with increasing [[senescence]]. Essentially, aging-associated diseases are [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] arising from [[senescence]]. Age-associated diseases are to be distinguished from the [[ageing|aging]] process itself  because all adult animals age, save for a few rare [[Negligible senescence|exceptions]], but not all adult animals experience all age-associated diseases. Aging-associated diseases do not refer to age-specific diseases, such as the [[List of childhood diseases|childhood diseases]] [[chicken pox]] and [[measles]]. "Aging-associated disease" is used here to mean "diseases of the elderly". Nor should aging-associated diseases be confused with [[accelerated aging disease]]s, all of which are [[genetic disorder]]s.

Examples of aging-associated diseases are [[atherosclerosis]] and [[cardiovascular disease]], [[cancer]], [[arthritis]], [[cataracts]], [[osteoporosis]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type&amp;nbsp;2 diabetes]], [[hypertension]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The incidence of all of these diseases increases rapidly with [[ageing|aging]] (increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with age, in the case of cancer). 
[[File:Age Specific SEER Incidence Rates 2003-2007.svg|thumb|Age-Specific [[Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results|SEER]] Incidence Rates, 2003-2007]]

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aubrey D.N.J |first=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |title=Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations |journal=Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology |volume=1 |issue=1, Article 5 |year=2007 |url=http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.2202/1941-6008.1011 |accessdate=August 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163622/http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |archivedate=October 13, 2016 |citeseerx=10.1.1.395.745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

==Patterns of differences==
By age&amp;nbsp;3 about 30% of [[rat]]s have had cancer, whereas by age&amp;nbsp;85 about 30% of humans have had cancer. Humans, [[dog]]s and [[rabbit]]s get Alzheimer's disease, but [[rodent]]s do not. Elderly rodents typically die of cancer or [[Nephrology|kidney disease]], but not of cardiovascular disease. In humans, the relative incidence of cancer increases exponentially with age for most cancers, but levels off or may even decline by age 60–75 (although [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]/[[rectum|rectal]] cancer continues to increase).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975–2003 |work=[[Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results]] (SEER) |publisher=National Cancer Institute |url=http://seer.cancer.gov/report_to_nation/supplemental/annual_report_75-03_agegroups.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2006-11-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925110425/http://seer.cancer.gov/report_to_nation/supplemental/annual_report_75-03_agegroups.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-25 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with the so-called [[Accelerated aging disease|segmental progerias]] are vulnerable to different sets of diseases. Those with [[Werner's syndrome]] suffer from osteoporosis, cataracts, and cardiovascular disease, but not [[neurodegeneration]] or Alzheimer's disease;  those with [[Down syndrome]] suffer type&amp;nbsp;2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, but not high [[blood pressure]], osteoporosis or cataracts. In [[Bloom syndrome]], those afflicted most often die of cancer.

==Research==
Aging (senescence) increases vulnerability to age-associated diseases, whereas [[genetics]] determines vulnerability or resistance between species and individuals within species. Some age-related changes (like [[Human_hair_color#Aging_or_achromotrichia|graying hair]]) are said to be unrelated to an increase in [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. But some [[biogerontologist]]s believe that the same underlying changes that cause [[Hair#Aging|graying hair]] also increase mortality in other organ systems and that understanding the incidence of age-associated disease will advance knowledge of the [[biology]] of senescence just as knowledge of [[childhood disease]]s advanced knowledge of [[Human development (biology)|human development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hayflick, L |title=The not-so-close relationship between biological aging and age-associated pathologies in humans |journal=The Journals of Gerontology: Series A |volume=59 |issue=6 |year=2004 |pages=B547–B550 |pmid=15215261 |doi=10.1093/gerona/59.6.B547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence]] (SENS) is a research strategy which aims to repair a few "root causes" for age-related illness and degeneration, as well as develop medical procedures to periodically repair all such damage in the human body, thereby maintaining a youth-like state indefinitely.&lt;ref name=SENSPlatform&gt;"[http://www.mfoundation.org/sens The SENS Platform: An Engineering Approach to Curing Aging]". Methuselah Foundation. Retrieved on June 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  So far, the SENS programme has identified seven types of aging-related damage, and feasible solutions have been outlined for each.  However, critics argue that the SENS agenda is optimistic at best, and that the aging process is too complex and little-understood for SENS to be scientific or implementable in the foreseeable future.&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warner | first1 = H | last2 = Anderson | first2 = J | last3 = Austad | first3 = S | last4 = Bergamini | first4 = E | last5 = Bredesen | first5 = D | last6 = Butler | first6 = R | last7 = Carnes | first7 = BA | last8 = Clark | first8 = BF | last9 = Cristofalo | first9 = V | displayauthors=8| title = Science fact and the SENS agenda | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 1006–8 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16264422 | pmc = 1371037 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Grey | first1 = AD | title = Like it or not, life-extension research extends beyond biogerontology | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 1000 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16264420 | pmc = 1371043 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey.

In [[agriculture]], [[fence]]s are used to keep [[animal]]s in or out of an area. They can be made from a wide variety of materials, depending on terrain, location and animals to be confined. Most '''agricultural fencing''' averages about {{convert|4|ft|m}} high, and in some places, the height and construction of fences designed to hold livestock is mandated by law.

==History==
[[Image:Fence1web.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Timber agricultural fence (photo taken in 1938).]]
Historically throughout most of the world, [[domestication|domesticated]] livestock would roam freely and were fenced out of areas, such as gardens or fields of crops, where they were unwanted. Over time, especially where crop agriculture became dominant and population density of both humans and animals was significant, livestock owners were made to fence their animals in.

The earliest fences were made of available materials, usually [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[wood]], and these materials are still used for some fences today. In areas where field stones are plentiful, fences have been built up over the years as the stones are removed from fields during tillage and planting of crops. The stones were placed on the field edge to get them out of the way. In time, the piles of stones grew high and wide.

In other areas, fences were constructed of [[timber]]. Log fences or [[split-rail fence]]s were simple fences constructed in newly cleared areas by stacking log rails. Earth could also be used as a fence; an example was what is now called the [[ha-ha (garden)|sunken fence]], or "ha-ha," a type of wall built by digging a ditch with one steep side (which animals cannot scale) and one sloped side (where the animals roam).
{{-}}

==Fence laws==
The tradition of fencing out unwanted livestock prevails even today in some sparsely populated areas. For example, until the mid-20th century, most states in the American West were called "[[open range]]" ("fence out") states, in contrast to Eastern and Midwestern states which long had "fence in" laws where livestock must be confined by their owners.  Though the open range was part of the western tradition, over time, open range was limited long before it was eliminated completely; first came an obligation to keep cattle from roaming onto state and federal highways, where collisions with fast-moving cars and trucks created a public safety hazard.  In addition, voters could voluntarily choose to make certain heavily farmed areas a "herd district,"  where livestock needed to be fenced in, a process that also became popular in areas where development of [[hobby farm]]s created conflicts between large and small landowners.  Over time, court cases steadily limited the application of open range law until the present day, where it is the exception rather than the rule in many parts of the American West.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the law is different for private land and [[common land]].  On private land it is the owner's responsibility to fence livestock in, but it is the responsibility of landowners bordering a common to fence the common's livestock out.

==Modern styles==

===Wire fences===
The principle of wire fences is that they are supported mainly by tension, being stretched between heavy [[strut]]ted or [[guy-wire]]d posts at ends, corners, and ideally at intervals in longer stretches (every 50 to 300 metres, 150 to 1000 feet).  Between these braced posts are additional smaller wooden or metal posts which keep the wires spaced and upright, usually 3 to 6 metre (10 to 20 feet) apart, depending on the style of fencing used.

Traditionally, wire fencing material is made of [[galvanization|galvanized]] [[mild steel]], but galvanized high-tensile steel is now also used in many places. To prevent sagging of the fence, which raises the risk of entanglement or escape, the wire is tensioned as much as the material will safely allow during construction by various means, including a hand-operated "wire stretcher" or "fence stretcher"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA897&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gdhATrWrH8qhsQLUgbXcCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Science%201935%20plane%20%22Popular%20Mechanics%22&amp;f=true "Handy Wire-Pulling Tool Has Many Uses" ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1934]&lt;/ref&gt; (called a "monkey strainer" in some areas) or other leverage devices, a [[winch]], or even by carefully pulling with a [[tractor]] or other vehicle.

Wire fences are typically run on wooden posts, either from trees commercially grown in [[plantation]]s or (particularly in the American West) cut from public lands.  When less expensive or more readily available than wood, steel [[T-post]]s or [[star post]]s are used, usually alternating every 2 to 5 steel posts with a more stable wood post.  Non-electrified wire is attached to wooden posts using fencing staples (for intermediate posts, these are fitted loosely, not gripping the wire).  Non-electrified wire is held on T-posts by means of wire "clips" made of smooth galvanized wire that wrap around the back of the post and hook onto the wire on either side of the post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kencove.com/oa/pdf/P22_23.pdf Steel posts and accessories]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than in a truly desert climate, use of rot-resistant wooden posts or steel posts is advised.  In the United States, wood with natural rot resistance, such as [[oak]] and [[juniper]], was often used until it became in short supply in the 1950s. Then, chemically treated [[pine]] and [[spruce]] posts became prevalent, and these are also widely used in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], together with [[chestnut]]. [[Creosote]], [[pentachlorophenol]], and [[chromated copper arsenate]] are all widely used in the US and elsewhere for treatment (although some of these chemicals are subject to legal controls).

====Barbed wire====
[[Image:Fence 400px.jpg|thumb|Chain link fence with barbed wire on top.]]
[[Image:Barbed Wire, SC, Victoria, 15.9.2007.jpg|thumb|Detail of barbed wire]]

The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought the first [[barbed wire]] (also "barbwire" or just "barb") fences, which were widely used after their introduction in the mid-19th century. This technology made it economically feasible to fence [[rangeland]] for the first time. In the United States, introduction of barbed wire contributed to the [[range war]]s of that century, as various [[ranch]] interests attempted to use barbed wire fences to claim exclusive access to the best pasture and water resources, including those lands in the [[public domain]].  It also exacerbated tensions between cattle ranchers and crop farmers, partly when access to water was involved.

Barbed wire has been made by many manufacturers in an almost endless variety of styles. For the most part these were functionally identical. The differences reflected peculiarities of each manufacturing process rather than deliberate design of the end product. Sections of unusual barbed wire are collected by some enthusiasts.

The traditional barbed wire used since the late 19th century and into the present day was made from two [[mild steel]] wires twisted together, usually of about 12 or 14 gauge, with about 15-30 twists per metre. Steel barbs were attached every 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm. Barbs had either two or four points, with the two point design using somewhat heavier and longer barbs. The relative merits of two point vs. four point barbed wire are the subject of deeply held views among many farmers and ranchers, to the extent that both types are still made today.

Typically four strands of barbed wire, with the lowest strand no more than {{convert|12|in|mm}} from the ground and the top strand at least 48&amp;nbsp;inches above the ground, make up a legal fence in the western United States.  Better-quality fences have five strands, older fences often had only three strands, and just two strands is widely used in Britain if only adult cattle are being contained.  Other variations exist, depending on local laws and the purpose of the fence.

Barbed wire is particularly effective for containing [[cattle]].  In [[pasture]]s containing both cattle and [[sheep]], one or two strands of barbed wire is used in conjunction with woven wire to both discourage cattle from reaching over the top of a fence and to keep sheep from crawling under.  Though often used in many areas for [[horse]]s, barbed wire is not advised; its use is considered poor [[Horse care|management]].  There is very high risk of injury occurring when a thin-skinned, fast-moving animal with long legs runs into it or puts a leg through the strands.

====Smooth wire====
[[Image:SmoothWire.jpg|thumb|Smooth (or plain) wire is less likely to cause lacerations than barbed wire]]
Smooth (or plain) wire is essentially the same product as barbed wire with no barbs &amp;ndash; either a two-wire twist or a single strand.  Its primary advantage is that it is less likely to cause lacerations and cuts if an animal becomes entangled in it or rubs against it.  However, animals will readily lean on mild steel smooth wire, stretching it out of shape or loosening it from the posts, and for this reason it is often used in high-tensile form, which more easily springs back to its original length.  Smooth wire fencing is often used as an inexpensive material to safely contain horses and other animals that run a high risk of entanglement, usually in conjunction with a line of [[electric fence]].  Smooth wire is also used in securing fence-post braces and other uses where barbed wire is not recommended

====High tensile wire====
High tensile (H-T or HT) fencing is a special hard, springy [http://www.premier1supplies.com/img/instruction/153.pdf steel wire] that was introduced in the 1970s and has slowly gained acceptance. The wire may be a single strand plain or barbed wire, or woven mesh, and is capable of much higher tension than [[mild steel]].  It permits the use of wider post spacings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://efotg.sc.egov.usda.gov//references/public/NM/382spec.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008172211/http://efotg.sc.egov.usda.gov//references/public/NM/382spec.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is neither stretched easily by animals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tejasranchfence.com/about-us/ranch-fence-materials/|title=Quality Ranch Fence Materials {{!}} Tejas Ranch &amp; Game Fence|work=Tejas Ranch &amp; Game Fence|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, nor by fallen trees or branches.  It can be insulated and electrified.  Because of the wide spacing of the posts, thin metal or wood spacers (or "droppers") may be attached to the wires between posts to maintain their spacing.

Joining HT wire is difficult because of its stiffness and its reduction in strength when bent sharply.  However, it may be joined effectively with proprietary clips.  HT wire is more expensive than mild steel, but because of the need for fewer posts, the overall cost of the fencing is usually comparable.

Because it does not stretch, animals are less likely to become entangled in HT wire.  However, for the same reason, if an animal does become entangled or runs into a few strands at a high speed, it can be deadly, and is sometimes referred to as having a "[[cheese slicer]]" effect on the animal.

Trellising for horticultural purposes is generally constructed from HT wire as it is able to withstand a higher crop load without breaking or stretching.

====Woven wire====
[[Image:Roo in Ringlock.jpg|thumb|A [[kangaroo]] trapped in ringlock or "sheep" fencing.]]
[[Image:WovenWire.jpg|thumb|A closely spaced woven wire such as this "no climb" fence has a lower risk of animals becoming entrapped and injured. Note "knots" at each junction securing the wire together]]
Barbed wire cannot effectively contain [[pig]]s, [[goat]]s or [[sheep]]. Where these animals are to be fenced, woven wire (called sheep or pig netting in Britain, sheep fence or hog fence in the United States) is used instead, often with one or more strands of barbed wire at the top. For swine, a ground-level barbed wire strand or electrified wire is used as well to prevent them digging beneath the fence.

Agricultural woven wire is identifiable by wire "knots" wrapped around each intersecting wire.  Cheaper forms of wire used in residential fences are often spot welded at junctions and as such are less sturdy and may break, creating a hazard for enclosed animals.  Woven wire is more costly to purchase and time-consuming to install than is basic wire, but is often safer and less expensive than wood, pipe, or other materials.

Woven wire with large openings (known as "sheep fence" in the western United States and ''Ringlock'' in Australia) has some potential hazards.  Animals contained inside the fence can easily put a foot through the wide squares while grazing along the edge of the fenceline or while reaching over it, and then become tangled in the fence. It is also dangerous for wild animals, such as [[deer]], [[kangaroo]]s or [[Wallaby|wallabies]] that attempt to jump such fences.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  These can become trapped when their back feet clip the fencing and get caught.  While they can be cut out, they are often seriously injured and must be [[animal euthanasia|euthanized]].  A variation, called "field fence," has narrower openings at the bottom and wider openings at the top, which prevents animals from getting their feet entangled while grazing close to the fence, though is of little help if an animal becomes tangled in the openings higher up.

Horses and ponies in particular are safer kept inside woven wire fence with squares of smaller dimensions, such as "no climb" fence with squares that are approximately two inches by four inches.  This type of wire is also more effective for containing goats.

Another variant on woven wire is the "hog panel," which consists of heavy welded wire approximately {{convert|.25|in|mm|0}} or more in diameter. It resembles field fence in appearance, but is sold in panels rather than rolls and is not easily wrapped or bent.  However, larger livestock such as horses or cattle can easily deform hog panels, so if used to contain large animals, it requires supporting rails or pipe on both the top and sides. It has some of the same strengths and weaknesses as field fence.  Though animals are less likely to become entangled in it, the wire is far harder to cut if they do.

[[Chain link fence|Chain link]] fencing is, arguably a form of woven wire, and is occasionally used for some livestock containment.  However, due to cost, it is not particularly common for fencing large areas where less-expensive forms of woven wire are equally suitable.  When used in small enclosures, it is easily deformed by livestock, resulting in high ongoing maintenance costs.

====Deer fence====
[[Deer]] and many [[goat]]s can easily jump an ordinary agricultural fence, and so special fencing is needed for farming goats or deer, or to keep wild deer out of farmland and gardens.  Deer fence is often made of lightweight woven wire netting nearly 2 metres (about six feet) high on lightweight posts, otherwise made like an ordinary woven wire fence.

In areas where such a tall fence is unsuitable (for example, on mountains subject to very high winds), deer may be excluded (or contained) by a fence of ordinary height (about 1.5 metres, four feet), with a smaller one of about one metre (three feet) high, about one metre away from it, on the same side as the deer.  The additional width prevents deer approaching the fence close enough to jump it.

===Electric fence===
{{Main|Electric fence}}
[[Image:ElectricSynthetic.jpg|thumb|250px|In addition to single strand wire, electric fencing is also made of synthetic materials with fine wire interwoven throughout the fence strands]]

Electric fencing became widely available in the 1950s and has been widely used both for temporary fences and as a means to improve the security of fences made of other materials.  It is most commonly made using lightweight steel wire (usually 14-17 gauge) attached to posts with [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] made of [[porcelain]] or [[plastic]]. Synthetic web or rope with thin steel wires interwoven to carry the electrical charge has become popular in recent years, particularly where additional visibility is desired.

A fence charger places an electrical pulse from ground to the wire about once per second. The pulse is narrow and usually around 5-20 kV. Animals receive an uncomfortable but harmless shock when contacting the wire, and learn to stay away from it.

=== Synthetic fence ===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}

{{Main|Synthetic fence}}
[[File:Horse in vinyl fence.jpg|thumb|Horse behind vinyl fence consisting of two vinyl 3-wire "rails" and one vinyl-covered wire]]
[[Synthetic fence]]s encompass a wide range of products.  [[Polyvinyl chloride|Vinyl]]-coated wire fence is usually based on high-tensile wire with a vinyl coating.  Some forms are non-electric, others embed layers of [[graphite]] to carry a current from the wire to the outside of the coated product so that it can be electrified.  It can be of any color, with white particularly common in the United States so that the fencing is visible to livestock. Most forms can be installed on either wood posts or steel [[t-post]]s.

A variant, sometimes called "vinyl rail" or "strap fencing" consists of two or more vinyl-encased wires with vinyl or other synthetic between them to create a "rail" that is anywhere from {{convert|1|to|10|cm|in|0}} wide.  Some forms may be electrified by use of a special coating on the top wire of the "rail."

Vinyl fence is installed in a manner similar to plain high-tensile fence and must be stretched tight.  Strong bracing of posts at corners and in the middle of long fencelines is required.  Like other wire fences, keeping vinyl fencing tightened on a regular basis is key to safety and appearance.

A mesh form of vinyl fencing without internal wires is marketed as "deer fence" and used in some locations to augment other fencing to keep out wild animals.  There are also some forms of vinyl fencing that look similar to vinyl-coated wire, but do not contain an internal wire, that are marketed to livestock owners.  They are marketed as particularly safe, but their strength in containing animals is under debate.  These products are very new to the market.

===Wood, pipe and other materials===
[[Image:PipeFence.jpg|thumb|A pipe fence is very strong and will not break easily]]

Fences of [[wood]], stranded cable, and pipe are used where cost is less of a consideration, particularly on horse farms, or in pens or corrals where livestock are likely to challenge the fence.  Synthetic materials with wood-like qualities are also used, though they are the most expensive option in most situations. In some areas, these types of fencing materials can be cost-effective if plentiful.  For example, scrap pipe is often easily obtained at a low price if oil fields are nearby, and wooden rails can sometimes be harvested from the owner's own land if it contains suitable standing timber.

[[Fladry line]]s, made of cloth, metal and/or other materials, are sometimes used on fences to discourage predators from entering a livestock enclosure. (also see: [[Cattle grid]])

==Maintenance==

All types of agricultural fencing require regular maintenance to ensure their effectiveness. Cattle and horses are strong enough to go through most types of fence by main force, and occasionally do so when frightened or motivated by hunger, thirst, or sex drive. Weather, flood, fire, and damage from vandals or motor vehicle accidents can do similar damage and may allow livestock to escape.

'''Anastasie Fătu''' (originally '''Năstase Fêtu''' or '''Fĕtu''',&lt;ref&gt;Anastasiu, p. 705; Urechia (1892), pp. 205, 267&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Anastasius Fétul''', '''Anastasie Fĕtul''' or '''Anastase Fătul'''; January 2, 1816 – March 15, 1886) was a [[Moldavia]]n and [[Romania]]n physician, naturalist, philanthropist and political figure, a titular member of the [[Romanian Academy]] and founder of [[Iași]]'s [[Iași Botanical Garden|Botanical Garden]]. Of lowly origins, he benefited from the meritocratic program instituted by Moldavia's government in the 1830s, and went on to study law at the [[University of Vienna]], with hopes of becoming a political economist. After graduating, he changed his professional path, and trained in medicine at the [[University of Paris]]. Recognized for pioneering contributions in [[cardiology]], [[pediatrics]], [[obstetrics]] and [[balneotherapy]], he was also an early speaker for [[public health]] and [[social medicine]], as well as an educational theorist and textbook author. Fătu's career as a professor of natural sciences took him to the Gregorian Institute, the [[Socola Monastery]] school, and ultimately [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|Iași University]], where he took steps to create [[Grigore T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy|a regional medical school]].

In parallel to his career in science, Fătu served one term in the [[ad-hoc Divan]] (1857–1858), then several in the [[Parliament of Romania]], initially its [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]]; he was [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly Chairman]] in 1868, and an associate of the [[Free and Independent Faction]] during the late 1860s and 1870s, espousing a platform of radical [[economic antisemitism]]. By 1878, he was part of the Factionalist chapter which caucused with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]].

Inducted into the Academy in 1871, he became one of its main sponsors, and thus a patron of hard science in Romania. While there, he helped standardize scientific references, and, siding with the partisans of [[phonemic orthography]], participated in the creation of a specialized [[Romanian vocabulary]]. Criticized by his adversaries at ''[[Junimea]]'' society for his accumulation of offices, and for collecting a large salary as curator of [[Sfântul Spiridon Hospital]], Fătu nevertheless donated most of his money to the Academy. The rest of his estate was at the center of legal disputes which lasted into the 1890s.

==Biography==

===Early life and studies abroad===
While he remains fundamentally associated with the city of Iași, Fătu was actually born just to the south of it, at [[Berezeni|Mușata]], [[Fălciu County]]—presently [[Vaslui County]]—on January 2, 1816 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]: December 21, 1815).&lt;ref&gt;Buda, pp. 57, 78. See also Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; He had a younger brother, Iacob,&lt;ref&gt;Bodea, pp. 287–288&lt;/ref&gt; who worked alongside [[Costache Conachi]] as a translator of literature.&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al289"&gt;Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Their father, born into a peasant family, was a parson of the [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Moldavian Orthodox Metropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Buda, pp. 57, 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adx246"&gt;[[A. D. Xenopol]], ''Istoria românilor din Dacia Traiană. Vol. XI: Istoria politică a țărilor române dela 1822—1848''. Bucharest: [[Cartea Românească]], 1930.  {{OCLC|163121057}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing primary school in [[Huși]], at the school maintained by the [[Diocese of Huși|Orthodox bishopric]],&lt;ref name="ob443"&gt;Buda, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; Anastasie passed an examination and received a scholarship for Iași's [[Vasilian Gymnasium]],&lt;ref name="vau(92)205"&gt;Urechia (1892), p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; thus profiting from a meritocratic shift in Moldavian society. As noted by historian [[A. D. Xenopol]], [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian Prince]] [[Mihail Sturdza]] and his adviser [[Gheorghe Asachi]] were tacitly encouraging "people from the lower strata of society" to acquire and education, and then to take up employment in the state apparatus, at the expense of [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyardom]].&lt;ref name="adx246"/&gt; Scholar [[V. A. Urechia]] also records the "great diversity of origin" at the Vasilian [[boarding school]], arguing that it was a positive contribution to Romania's culture.&lt;ref name="vau(92)205"/&gt;

From 1834, one of six Moldavians to have qualified for a scholarship from the banker-philanthropist Hagi Constantin Popp,&lt;ref&gt;Bodea, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Fătu was sent abroad, on condition that, upon graduating, he would return the favor by teaching a public "course in philosophy, law and political economy".&lt;ref&gt;Anastasiu, pp. 705–706; Urechia (1892), pp. 267–270, 377–378&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to study in the [[Austrian Empire]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. Another scholarship recipient was [[Anton Velini]], who remained his friend in later years,&lt;ref&gt;Bodea, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; and with whom he studied law, physics and mathematics as an undergraduate.&lt;ref&gt;Urechia (1892), pp. 270, 377–378&lt;/ref&gt; It was also here that Fătu met ethnic Romanians from the Austrian [[Duchy of Bukovina]]—Constantin Wassilko and the [[Hurmuzachi brothers]], and, to some degree, also associated with students from [[Transylvania]]; together, they established a pan-Romanian club.&lt;ref&gt;Bodea, pp. 37–38, 43–45&lt;/ref&gt; After taking his Doctorate of Law, and also auditing courses at [[Medical University of Vienna|Vienna Medical Faculty]] (1839–1841),&lt;ref name="ob443"/&gt; Fătu received permission from the Moldavian government to continue his studies in France; he enlisted at the [[University of Paris]] medical school, but remained in contact with the Vienna expatriates.&lt;ref&gt;Bodea, pp. 38, 43–45, 287–288. See also Anastasiu, p. 708; Buda, pp. 57–58, 443&lt;/ref&gt; By August 1846, he was friends with two other Moldavian youths in Paris, all three active politically: [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], [[Scarlat Vârnav]], and [[Nicolae Ionescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodea, pp. 287–288, 292–293&lt;/ref&gt; His friends at home included fellow naturalist [[Ion Ionescu de la Brad]], who noted admiringly that Fătu was "enamored with his studies", and an inspiration to the other Moldavians.&lt;ref&gt;Bodea, pp. 292–293&lt;/ref&gt;

Fătu became a Doctor of Medicine in 1847, with a thesis on [[cardiac examination]] (including the study of [[menstruation]] flow), published under the name Anastasius Fétul (''Des signes des maladies du coeur en général'').&lt;ref&gt;Buda, p. 443; Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; He was invited to remain in Paris and practice there,&lt;ref name="ricc31"&gt;Constantinescu, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; but, after a series of European travels,&lt;ref name="na&amp;as424"&gt;N. Angelescu, A. Dima, "Personalități chirurgicale ieșene", in ''Jurnalul de Chirurgie'', Nr. 4/2006, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to Moldavia. He was appointed by Prince [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]] to serve as head physician of Iași, and also as surgeon-general of the [[Moldavian military forces|Moldavian Militia]],&lt;ref name="ricc31"/&gt; with the boyar title of ''[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|Aga]]''.&lt;ref name="rșc285"&gt;Rășcanu, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to prominence===
In 1850, Fătu contributed a monograph on the prevention of [[malaria]]; he also focused his activity on obstretics, balneotherapy and dietetics, with ''Învățătură dietetică relativă la scrofule'' ("A Dietary Instruction against [[Scrofulae]]"), followed by ''Descrierea și întrebuințarea apeĭ simple și a apelor minerale din Moldova'' ("Description and Use of Plain and Mineral Water in Moldavia", 1851) and ''Manualu pentru învățĕtura móșelor'' ("A Textbook of [[Midwife]] Instructions", 1852).&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu ''et al.'', pp. 288–289; Vintilă-Ghițulescu, pp. 32, 212–213, 228, 252, 425, 471. See also Buda, pp. 443, 444; Urechia (1894), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he insisted, against religious observance and popular superstition, that women wash themselves as often as possible; he also began advocating a government-sponsored program of spa tourism, but his proposal was casually ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă-Ghițulescu, pp. 212–213, 299, 425&lt;/ref&gt; Fătu's hypothesis that sulfur baths could work against [[syphilis]] was more reserved than other claims to the same effect from his contemporaries, but nonetheless contributed to a prevailing mythology in later [[folk medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Valeriu L. Bologa, "Istoria sifilisului", in ''Buletin Eugenic și Biopolitic'', Nr. 3–4/1930, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anastasie Fătu.jpg|thumb|180px|Photograph of Fătu, ca. 1860]]
In 1852, ''Aga'' Fătu established the Gregorian Institute (named for the patron-prince Ghica), which included a midwives' school that was at some point co-headed by [[Nicolae Negură]].&lt;ref name="na&amp;as424"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buda, p. 443; Vintilă-Ghițulescu, pp. 252, 471&lt;/ref&gt; Within this institution, doctors Fătu and [[Gheorghe Cuciureanu]] also pioneered pediatrics, and ran Moldavia's only [[pre-kindergarten]] for [[abandoned children]].&lt;ref name="ob443"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mmdisc"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihail Mihailide, [http://www.viata-medicala.ro/Discursuri-exemplare.html*articleID_932-dArt.html "Discursuri exemplare"], in ''[[Viața Medicală]]'', Nr. 52 (1389), December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Fătu also created the Society for the Encouragement of Young Romanians to Study Abroad on March 22, 1855, providing it with a capital of 1,000 [[ducat]]s from his own estate,&lt;ref&gt;Urechia (1894), pp. 122–123, 225&lt;/ref&gt; and publishing its statutes as a brochure.&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al289"/&gt; The following year, he set up on his property at Râpa Galbenă the [[Iași Botanical Garden]], celebrated as the very first one in the two [[Danubian Principalities]] (Moldavia and [[Wallachia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Buda, p. 444; Chirilă, p. 18; Constantinescu, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The collection, Fătu asserted, was meant to both improve the environment and educate the youth; upon inauguration, it comprised 2,500 plant species from several continents, as well as artificial ponds and [[greenhouse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Chirilă, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Crimean War]] toppled the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime, placing the Danubian Principalities under the shared tutelage of [[Great Powers]], Fătu became marginally involved in the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] and [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian nationalist]] movement. By June 1856, he was a member of the enlarged Unionist Committee, which openly called for union between Moldavia and Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, pp. 332–333&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1857, he joined a deputation sent by the Moldavian printers, asking the powers to lift censorship laws—other envoys were [[Vasile Alecsandri]], [[Constantin Hurmuzachi]], and [[Alecu Donici]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]], ''Vasile Alecsandri. Povestirea unei vieți'', p. 38. Bucharest: [[Editura Cultura Națională]], 1926.  {{OCLC|485739014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then ran in the [[Moldavian legislative election, September 1857|elections of September]], taking a seat for Iași in the [[ad-hoc Divan]].&lt;ref name="rșc285"/&gt; This new legislature, sanctioned by the Great Powers, replaced a Divan [[Moldavian legislative election, July 1857|elected fraudulently in July]].&lt;ref&gt;Rășcanu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The new chambers inaugurated a process whereby Fătu's Paris friend, Cuza, was elected the new prince of Moldavia and then ''[[Domnitor]]'' of the [[United Principalities]] (the basis for modern Romania); Fătu is known to have supported Cuza's [[National Party (Romania)|National Party]], and to have kept a portrait of the ''Domnitor''.&lt;ref&gt;Chirilă, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to publishing in 1863 with ''Proiectu de Organisarea Policieĭ Sanitarĭâ in Romania'' ("A Project for Instituting Romania's Sanitary Police"), which also functioned as Romania's first attempt at a sanitary code.&lt;ref&gt;Buda, pp. 443–444; Felix, pp. 11, 17–18; Vintilă-Ghițulescu, pp. 121–121, 255, 299, 446. See also Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; The same text pioneered [[medical jurisprudence]], including the basics of [[mental health law]] and [[forensic science]],&lt;ref&gt;Buda, pp. 443–444&lt;/ref&gt; sketched out [[food safety]] codes, regulated the creation of public toilets, and standardized the depth of graves.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă-Ghițulescu, pp. 121–122, 299–300, 446&lt;/ref&gt; It also called for a ban on open-casket church funerals, proposing to isolate dead bodies under the close watch of specialized bailiffs.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă-Ghițulescu, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; As social historian Constanța Vintilă-Ghițulescu remarks, Fătu's law integrated well within the "hygienist wave" of "civilized Europe", with doctors emerging as "key figures in the construction of the modern state."&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă-Ghițulescu, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to fellow hygienist [[Iacob Felix]], the project was simply ignored by the government of [[Nicolae Crețulescu]], and the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] consulted it only for laws establishing [[county council]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Felix, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factionalist debut===
Fătu returned to politics after [[Monstrous coalition|''Domnitor'' Cuza's ouster]]. By the time of the [[Romanian general election, April 1866|April 1866 election]], he supported a project to remake the centralized state into a federal Romania, with separate Moldavian institutions. Drafted by lawyer Gheorghe Cigaras, it was endorsed by members of an emergent regional party, the [[Free and Independent Faction]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol (1910), pp. 496–498&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Fătu sided with the Factionalists, who came to be headed by [[Nicolae Ionescu]], and with [[Ion C. Brătianu]]'s "Red" radicals, against moderate liberals and "White" conservatives. In Moldavia in particular, the central issue dividing society was that of [[Jewish emancipation]]: Factionalists, motivated by [[economic antisemitism]], opposed the integration of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jews]], whereas conservatives supported it.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, ''passim''; Michelson, pp. 226–228; Scurtu, pp. 53–56; Xenopol (1910), pp. 504–506, 518–519, 570&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1866, antisemitic riots implicating Faction members erupted in Iași, [[Bârlad]], [[Roman, Romania|Roman]] and [[Botoșani]]. The clampdown by the authorities resulted in the temporary arrest of various Factionalists and allies: Fătu was picked up alongside [[Vasile Gheorghian]], [[Alexandru Gheorghiu]], [[Alecu D. Holban]] and [[Petru Poni]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, pp. 510–512&lt;/ref&gt;

Fătu then helped organize the [[Romanian general election, November 1866|November 1866 election]], during which he proposed Cuciureanu, his former associate, as a candidate for the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Gorovei]], ''Monografia Orașului Botoșani'', pp. 114–115. Botoșani: Ediția Primăriei de Botoșani, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; He himself won a deputy seat for the 2nd College of [[Iași County]],&lt;ref&gt;"Deputațiĭ aleșĭ", in ''[[Românul|Romanulu]]'', November 2, 1866, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and, in December, was elected one of four vice presidents of the Assembly, seconding [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly Chairman]] [[Lascăr Catargiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Moroianu, "Dezbateri parlamentare și patimi politice între 1866–1867", in ''Buridava'', Vol. VI, 2008, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Reelected for the Iași 2nd College [[Romanian general election, 1867|in December 1867]],&lt;ref&gt;"Tabloulu generalu alu alegeriloru pentru Adunarea Deputatiloru", in ''[[Românul|Romanulu]]'', December 18–19, 1867, p. 1081&lt;/ref&gt; and propelled by an understanding between the "Reds" and the Factionalists,&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Fătu then became house chairman, elected with 80 votes of 105 on January 27, 1868.&lt;ref&gt;"Romani'a", in ''Federatiunea'', Nr. 13/1868, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he notably abstained during [[Strousberg Affair|the vote on railway concessions]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, pp. 38–42&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 1868, with anti-Jewish pogroms occurring at [[Bacău]] and elsewhere, Fătu and 30 other deputies presented an antisemitic law proposal, one radical enough to be criticized by Brătianu, who deemed it uncivilized.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp. 20–23; Scurtu, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming to be a law on "the regularization of the state of Jews in Romania", Fătu's project notably banned Jews from settling anywhere in the countryside, and also from purchasing land.&lt;ref&gt;Michelson, pp. 227–228. See also Brătescu, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Indirectly responsible for the fall of the [[Ștefan Golescu]] cabinet and a rift between the "Reds" and the Faction, this proposed legislation was at the center of an international scandal—not just because it discriminated against Jews, but also because it was [[Ex post facto law|retroactive in nature]].&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

With General [[Nicolae Golescu]] succeeding his brother as head of the "Red" cabinet, the Faction began moving closer to the opposition "Whites". Fătu, however, remained friendly toward the "Reds". During May, as Ionescu took up [[filibuster]]ing in Senate, all Factionalist deputies but Fătu showed up to express their support.&lt;ref&gt;[[N. T. Orășanu|Nicor.]], "Camera de josŭ", in ''[[Ghimpele]]'', Nr. 5/1868, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; In June, going against the Factionalist party line, Fătu abstained from the Assembly's vote to depose Golescu—the Assembly went against the Senate, prompting a [[Romanian Senate election, 1868|senatorial recall in early elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Such developments also signaled Fătu's removal from the Assembly presidency, although, in November 1869, he was again elected as vice president (seconding Brătianu, alongside [[Grigore Arghiropol]], [[Panait Donici]], and [[C. A. Rosetti]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking up medical teaching at [[Socola Monastery]] seminary in 1869,&lt;ref name="ob444"&gt;Buda, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; by 1870 Fătu was editing the country's most prestigious research journal, ''Revista Șciințifică'', with [[C. F. Robescu]] and [[Grigoriu Ștefănescu]] as fellow directors.&lt;ref&gt;Dobre, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; This hosted his inventory of species in the Botanical Garden, which also came out as a standalone book in 1871.&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al289"/&gt; Also that year, he published at Socola a ''Manualu de medicină practică'' ("Textbook of Applied Medicine"). Reviewing the work in ''Revista Șciințifică'', agronomist [[Petre S. Aurelian]] recorded as a "calamity" news that Fătu had been sacked from the seminary, by order of [[Christian Tell]], the [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Education Minister]] in [[Dimitrie Ghica]]'s "White" cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petre S. Aurelian]], "Cronica", in ''Revista Șciințifică'', Nr. 21/1871, pp. 321–322&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Free and Independent Faction, Fătu and Ionescu formed the more radical opposition to the "Whites", led at the time by [[Manolache Costache Epureanu|Manolache Epureanu]]. Fătu ran in the [[Romanian general election, 1870|elections of May 1870]], one of 34 Factionalists to win Assembly seats: not enough to topple the Epureanu cabinet, but causing a great upset in national politics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] (ed. [[Mircea Eliade]]), ''Scrieri literare, morale și politice. Tomul 2'', pp. 275–276. Bucharest: [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale|Fundația pentru Literatură și Artă Regele Carol II]], 1938. {{OCLC|45702309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing to serve several terms in both the Assembly and Senate,&lt;ref name="ricc31"/&gt; Fătu remained an inconsistent Factionalist, only allied with the movement for part of his life; the movement itself was amorphous and notoriously opportunistic.&lt;ref name="gfș101–2"&gt;Gheorghe-Florin Știrbăț, "'Partidul Liberalilor Moderați' din Iași la 1878. Unele considerații", in ''Carpica'', Vol. XLI, 2012, pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academy work===
On September 11, 1871, Fătu, Aurelian and Crețulescu were elected to the [[Romanian Academy]], or, as it was known back then, the "Romanian Academic Society", and thus founded a section for natural sciences. This honored the academicians' pledge of giving humanities and hard sciences equal exposure, after some 5 years of inactivity in that field; up to then, only [[Petrache Poenaru]] had been representing hard science at the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Berindei, p. 1082; Dobre, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; His inaugural address, received for the Academy by Urechia and published in 1873, was titled ''Încercările pentru dezvoltarea sciintielorŭ naturale în România'' ("Attempts to Develop Natural Sciences in Romania").&lt;ref&gt;Buda, pp. 21–79; Constantinescu, p. 31; Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; According to a later review by geologist [[Ion Th. Simionescu]], the speech was infused with Fătu's "love for his country".&lt;ref&gt;Simionescu, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; Fătu castigated "the inactivity and wrong direction" of Romanian scientific learning, and demanded direct intervention by the state—while praising private individuals who had compensated the lack of such support.&lt;ref&gt;Buda, pp. 21–55; Simionescu, pp. 451–452&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Factionalist politics had brought Fătu into conflict with another Iași-based institution, the conservative club ''[[Junimea]]'',&lt;ref name="gfș101–2"/&gt; ''Încercările...'' included polite references to ''Junimism'', honored for its commitment to the [[scientific method]] and to [[freedom of thought]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; At the Academy, Fătu and [[Alexandru Odobescu]] were coming to question the competence of its two leaders, [[August Treboniu Laurian]] and [[I. C. Massim]]. Fătu supported Odobescu and the ''Junimists''{{'}} plea for [[phonemic orthography]], and voted to audit Laurian's project for the ''[[Dicționarul Limbii Române|Romanian Language Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berindei, pp. 1075–1076&lt;/ref&gt; He was spotted at ''Junimea'' meetings, one of the ''caracudă'' ("small game") section, who attended without participating.&lt;ref&gt;Săteanu, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the ''Junimist'' [[Vasile Pogor]], who was cashier of his Society for the Encouragement of Young Romanians to Study Abroad, Fătu also contributed money for [[Vasile Conta]]'s tuition at [[University of Antwerp|Antwerp Business Institute]]; Conta, also a ''Junimea'' man, later sent him his manuscript collection of [[Romanian folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ana Conta-Kernbach]], "Biografia lui Basile Conta", in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 7–9/1915, pp. 134, 135; Săteanu, pp. 201, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite overcoming initial setbacks, the Academic Society was experiencing a financial impasse, which were felt especially hard by the science section. Partly in order to remedy this, in August 1872, Fătu donated 10,000 "[[Romanian leu|new lei]]" for the creation of his eponymous fund, with prizes going to Romania's best scientific cartography, and also the entire collection of ''Revista Științifică''.&lt;ref&gt;Dobre, pp. 328–331. See also Buda, pp. 76, 78, 444–445; Constantinescu, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, however, no researcher applied to collect his prize.&lt;ref&gt;Berinei, p. 1083&lt;/ref&gt; Also in August 1872, with Crețulescu replacing Laurian as Academy chairman, Fătu became its vice president, in succession to Massim.&lt;ref name="brd1072"&gt;Berindei, p. 1072&lt;/ref&gt; On September 19, he was also elected president of the scientific section (serving to 1876).&lt;ref&gt;Buda, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion, his fund was split into prizes for botany, agronomy, geology, chemical engineering, and balneotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Berindei, pp. 1082–1083; Dobre, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Fătu and [[Petru Poni]] insisted on sponsoring a meteorological sub-section, which became operational in September 1874 and employed Ionescu de la Brad as one of the main surveyors.&lt;ref&gt;Berindei, p. 1083; Dobre, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; Fătu also helped Ionescu de la Brad set up his own (since lost) botanical garden, at [[Negri, Bacău|Negri]].&lt;ref&gt;Gh. Cristea, "Viața științifică. Aniversarea a 150 de ani de la nașterea lui Ion Ionescu de la Brad", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Nr. 6/1968, p. 1214&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1872, Fătu was also president and re-organizer of the Iași Medical and Naturalist Society, which was working to establish a natural museum.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan, pp. 112–116, 146. See also Chirilă, pp. 16–17; Constantinescu, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside fellow naturalist [[Dimitrie Brândză]], he created a second, much smaller, botanical garden, near the museum building at Roset House, on Hagoaiei Street.&lt;ref&gt;Chirilă, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time, he supported scholar [[Bonifaciu Florescu]]'s short-lived project to set up an [[adult high school]], also co-founding with him a Society for Teaching the Romanian People.&lt;ref&gt;[[Perpessicius]], notes to [[Mihai Eminescu]], ''Opere, Vol. II. Poezii tipărite în timpul vieții; Note și variante: Dela Povestea codrului la Luceafărul'', p. 239. Bucharest: [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale|Fundația Regală pentru Literatură și Artă]], 1943.  {{OCLC|895263803}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a senator, he helped Felix promote a new project of sanitary law, which was eventually passed by both chambers in May 1874. It made sanitary inspection a function of [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Internal Affairs]].&lt;ref name="ob444"/&gt;

In 1875, Fătu produced ''Elemente de Botanica'' ("Elementary Botany"), Romania's first college textbook in that field,&lt;ref name="na&amp;as424"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buda, p. 444; Constantinescu, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; putting it up for Academy review. This was a groundbreaking initiative, because it standardized and affixed botanical notions in modern [[Romanian vocabulary]].&lt;ref&gt;Dobre, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually published as two volumes in 1878 and 1880, with Botanical Garden staff as editors, it was followed in 1885 by ''Elemente de Zoologie'' ("Elementary Zoology").&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al289"/&gt; By then, Fătu had replaced Brândză as titular professor at the new [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|Iași (Alexandru Ioan Cuza) University]], where he simultaneously taught botany, physiology, and zoology.&lt;ref&gt;Buda, pp. 443, 444. See also Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
At the time, Fătu also functioned as one of Iași's head physicians and curator (''epitrop'') of [[Sfântul Spiridon Hospital]], publishing in 1873 a report on the foundation, its furnishings, and its work.&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al289"/&gt; This activity of his was coming under scrutiny from ''Junimea''. The club's doyen, [[Titu Maiorescu]], noted in 1875 that most of Fătu's contributions were not fully philanthropic, as he claimed and expected others to perform: "To work for money only, now there is something Dr. Fătu knows how to do, with those 2,800 [[French franc|francs]] he picks up at the botanical garden, and a similar sum from the Academic Society, and so much more from Sfântul Spiridon etc., and then he presents himself as a great patriot."&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. Ornea]], ''Junimea și junimismul'', Vol. I. Bucharest: [[Editura Minerva]], 1998, p. 303.  {{ISBN|973-21-0562-3}}; Săteanu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, in 1876, with [[Ion Ghica]] taking over as Academy chairman, Fătu was also replaced as vice president by [[George Bariț]].&lt;ref name="brd1072"/&gt; In July of that year, selected by Poni and voted in by other inductees, he became a "special member" of the Medical and Naturalist Society, charged with curating its botanical fund.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Romanian War of Independence]], during [[Romanian general election, 1878|elections for the Senate]] which opposed ''Junimea'' to a local chapter of the federated [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], Fătu was one of the Factionalists who joined the latter. He thus ran on a list headed by [[Vasile Alecsandri]], directly against [[Petre P. Carp]].&lt;ref&gt;Săteanu, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; In his last years of activity, alongside [[Carol Davila]], Fătu also contributed greatly to the consolidation of a Iași public Medical Faculty—nucleus of the [[Grigore T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy]].&lt;ref name="ob443"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mmdisc"/&gt; From 1881, he was a member of the [[Senckenberg Nature Research Society]].&lt;ref name="ob444"/&gt; In the new [[Kingdom of Romania]], he still maintained an interest in other social and economic matters, and, in 1884, he was among the main contributors to Iași's first [[credit cooperative]], founded by Xenopol.&lt;ref&gt;''Statutele primei Societăți de economie din urbea Iași fondată în anul 1871 iunie 1'', pp. 24–29. Iași: Tipografia Națională, 1898&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1885, he played host to [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], who visited the Medical and Naturalist Society.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan, pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

Fătu withdrew from Sfântul Spiridon in 1885.&lt;ref name="ob443"/&gt; Before his death, which came on March 15 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]: March 3), 1886,&lt;ref name="Bogdan, p. 116"&gt;Bogdan, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; he was working with a commission to organize the Iași Medical Congress.&lt;ref&gt;"Sciri și fapte. Congresul medical", in ''Telegraphul. Ediția de Diminéță'', May 31, 1885, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, he was buried at Iași, with funeral orations by doctors [[Emanoil Riegler]], [[Alexandru A. Suțu]], and [[Eugen Rizu]];&lt;ref&gt;"Cronica zileĭ", in ''[[România Liberă]]'', March 9 (21), 1886, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; he had left the Academy "almost his entire fortune".&lt;ref&gt;"Academia Română", in ''[[România Liberă]]'', March 29 (April 10), 1888, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In his own admission speech in 1887, replacement [[Grigore Cobălcescu]], his "heart filled with sorrow", paid homage to "the late Anastasie Fetu".&lt;ref&gt;[[Grigore Cobălcescu]], "Despre originea și modulŭ de zăcere alŭ Petroliuluĭ în generalŭ și particularŭ în Carpațĭ. Discursŭ de recepțiune", in ''Analele Academieĭ Române. Memoriile Secțiuniĭ Șciințifice'', Series II, Vol. IX, 1886–1887, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

However, his overall pedagogical work had inconclusive results: in 1900, Simionescu noted that very little had been done to address the issues raised by Fătu in his 1873 speech, and that the speaker himself was "forgotten".&lt;ref&gt;Simionescu, pp. 451–452&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fătu was known affectionately to his fellow citizens as ''Dr. Buruienescu'' ("Dr. Weeds"), his garden was left in near-complete disrepair in the months after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Chirilă, pp. 18, 48&lt;/ref&gt; The Medical and Naturalist Society was also in disarray: Fătu had kept its records and funds in his private home, and his widow Ecaterina and family would not return them. A legal dispute followed, and the Fătus were forced to relinquish control—although, reportedly, some manuscripts were never returned.&lt;ref name="Bogdan, p. 116"/&gt; By March 1892, Ecaterina Fătu and her two minor children had also lost ownership of the family estate in [[Drăgușeni, Botoșani|Drăgușeni]], [[Dorohoi County]], as Anastasie had died without reimbursing a credit worth 200,000 lei.&lt;ref&gt;"Parte neoficială.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10840">An '''apicoplast''' is a [[Synapomorphy|derived]] non-[[photosynthetic]] [[plastid]] found in most [[Apicomplexa]], including ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' and other ''Plasmodium'' spp. (parasites causing malaria), but not in others such as ''[[Cryptosporidium]]''. It originated from an [[alga]] (there is debate as to whether this was a green or red alga) through [[secondary endosymbiosis]]. The apicoplast is surrounded by four membranes within the outermost part of the endomembrane system.&lt;ref name="Lim_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lim L, McFadden GI | title = The evolution, metabolism and functions of the apicoplast | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 365 | issue = 1541 | pages = 749–63 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20124342 | pmc = 2817234 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2009.0273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The apicoplast hosts important metabolic pathways like [[Fatty acid synthesis]]; Isoprenoid precursor synthesis and parts of the [[Heme]] biosynthesis pathway &lt;ref name="Sheiner_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheiner L, Vaidya AB, McFadden GI | title = The metabolic roles of the endosymbiotic organelles of Toxoplasma and Plasmodium spp | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 452–8 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23927894 | pmc = 3767399 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2013.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Apicoplasts are a [[relict]], nonphotosynthetic [[plastid]] found in most [[protozoa]]n parasites belonging to the [[phylum]] [[Apicomplexa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Campbell Biology | edition = 9th | first1 = Jane B. | last1 = Reece | first2 = Lisa A. | last2 = Urry | first3 = Michael L. | last3 = Cain | first4 = Steven A. | last4 = Wasserman | first5 = Peter V. | last5 = Minorsky | first6 = Robert B. | last6 = Jackson | name-list-format = vanc | location = Boston | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-321-55823-7 | oclc = 1008837408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maréchal_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maréchal E, Cesbron-Delauw MF | title = The apicoplast: a new member of the plastid family | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 200–5 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11335172 | doi = 10.1016/s1360-1385(01)01921-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most infamous Apicomplexan parasites is ''Plasmodium falciparum'', a causative agent of severe [[malaria]]. Because apicoplasts are vital to parasite survival, they provide an enticing target for antimalarial drugs.&lt;ref name="Ralph_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ralph SA, D'Ombrain MC, McFadden GI | title = The apicoplast as an antimalarial drug target | journal = Drug Resistance Updates | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 145–51 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11768328 | doi = 10.1054/drup.2001.0205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, apicoplasts' plant-like properties provide a target for [[herbicide|herbicidal]] drugs.&lt;ref name="Maréchal_2001"/&gt; And, with the emergence of malarial strains resistant to current treatments it is paramount that novel therapies, like herbicides, are explored and understood.&lt;ref name="Ralph_2001"/&gt; Furthermore, herbicides may be able to specifically target the parasite's plant-like apicoplast and without any noticeable effect on the mammalian host's cells.

==Evolutionary origin==
Evidence suggests that the apicoplast is a product of secondary [[endosymbiosis]],&lt;ref name="Ralph_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ralph SA, Foth BJ, Hall N, McFadden GI | title = Evolutionary pressures on apicoplast transit peptides | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 21 | issue = 12 | pages = 2183–94 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15317876 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msh233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the apicoplast may be homologous to the secondary plastid of the closely related [[dinoflagellate]] algae. An ancient cyanobacterium was first engulfed by a eukaryotic cell but was not digested.  The bacterium escaped being digested because it formed a symbiotic relationship with the host eukaryotic cell; both the eukaryote and the bacterium mutually benefited from their novel shared existence.&lt;ref name="Alberts_2004"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Bruce | last1 = Alberts | first2 = Dennis | last2 = Bray | first3 = Karen | last3 = Hopkin | name-list-format = vanc | title =Essential Cell Biology | edition = 2nd | location = New York; London | publisher = Garland Science, Taylor &amp; Francis Group | year = 2004 | chapter = The Eukaryotic Cell | pages = | isbn = 978-0-8153-3480-4 | oclc = 895254951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the primary endosymbiosis was a photosynthetic eukaryotic alga.  A descendent of this eukaryotic alga was then itself engulfed by a heterotrophic eukaryote with which it formed its own symbiotic relationship and was preserved as a plastid.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite web | first =  John W. | last = Kimball | name-list-format = vanc | title = Endosymbiosis and The Origin of Eukaryotes | url = http://www.biology-pages.info:80/E/Endosymbiosis.html | date = 16 December 2017 | work = Kimball's Biology Pages }}&lt;/ref&gt; The apicoplast evolved in its new role to preserve only those functions and genes necessary to beneficially contribute to the host-organelle relationship. The ancestral genome of more than 150 kb was reduced through deletions and rearrangements to its present 35 kb size.&lt;ref name="Maréchal_2001"/&gt; During the reorganization of the plastid the apicoplast lost its ability to photosynthesize.&lt;ref name="ref5"/&gt; These losses of function are hypothesized to have occurred at an early evolutionary stage in order to have allowed sufficient time for the complete degradation of acknowledged photosynthetic relicts&lt;ref name="Maréchal_2001"/&gt; and the disappearance of a [[nucleomorph]].&lt;ref name="ref5"/&gt;

==Architecture and distribution==
Most [[Apicomplexa]] contain a single ovoid shaped apicoplast that is found at the anterior of the invading parasitic cell.&lt;ref name="Maréchal_2001"/&gt; The apicoplast is situated in close proximity to the cell's [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and often closely associated with a mitochondrion. The small plastid, only 0.15-1.5 μm in diameter,&lt;ref name="Maréchal_2001"/&gt; is surrounded by four membranes.&lt;ref name="ref5"/&gt; The two inner membranes are derived from the algal plastid membranes;&lt;ref name="Maréchal_2001"/&gt; the next membrane out is called the periplastid membrane and is derived from the algal plasma membrane; Finally the outermost membrane belongs to the host endomembrane system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheiner L, Striepen B | title = Protein sorting in complex plastids | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1833 | issue = 2 | pages = 352–9 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 22683761 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.05.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the apicoplast's stroma is a 35 kb long circular DNA strand that codes for approximately 30 proteins, [[tRNA]]s and some [[RNA]]s.&lt;ref name="ref5"/&gt; Particles suspected to be bacterial [[ribosome]]s are present.&lt;ref name="Ralph_2001"/&gt; The plastid, at least in the [[Plasmodium]] species, also contains "tubular whorls" of membrane that bear a striking resemblance to the [[thylakoids]]&lt;ref name="Maréchal_2001"/&gt; of their [[chloroplast]] relatives.&lt;ref name="ref5"/&gt; The import of proteins into the apicoplast through the four membranes occurs through translocation complexes that originate from the algal plastid (for example: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheiner L, Fellows JD, Ovciarikova J, Brooks CF, Agrawal S, Holmes ZC, Bietz I, Flinner N, Heiny S, Mirus O, Przyborski JM, Striepen B | title = Toxoplasma gondii Toc75 Functions in Import of Stromal but not Peripheral Apicoplast Proteins | journal = Traffic | volume = 16 | issue = 12 | pages = 1254–69 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26381927 | doi = 10.1111/tra.12333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) or from a duplication of the [[Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation]] (for example: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agrawal S, van Dooren GG, Beatty WL, Striepen B | title = Genetic evidence that an endosymbiont-derived endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) system functions in import of apicoplast proteins | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 284 | issue = 48 | pages = 33683–91 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19808683 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M109.044024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Function ==
The apicoplast is a vital [[organelle]] to the parasite's survival.&lt;ref name="Maréchal_2001"/&gt; [[Tetracycline]], an antibiotic also used to combat [[malaria]] infections, is thought to function by targeting the apicoplast.&lt;ref name="DahlShock2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahl EL, Shock JL, Shenai BR, Gut J, DeRisi JL, Rosenthal PJ | title = Tetracyclines specifically target the apicoplast of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 50 | issue = 9 | pages = 3124–31 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16940111 | pmc = 1563505 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.00394-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It hosts four main metabolic pathways: 

===Fatty Acid Synthesis===

The destruction of the apicoplast does not immediately kill the [[parasite]] but instead prevents it from invading new host cells. This observation suggests that the apicoplast may be involved in [[lipid]] [[metabolism]]. If unable to synthesize sufficient [[fatty acid]]s the parasite is unable to form the parasitophorous [[vacuole]] (PV) that is imperative to a successful invasion of host cells. This conclusion is supported by the discovery of Type II Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) machinery in the apicoplast.&lt;ref name="Ralph_2001"/&gt;

===Isoprenoid Synthesis===

The apicoplast is also thought to have a role in [[isoprenoid]] synthesis, which are prosthetic groups on many enzymes and also act as precursors to [[ubiquinone]]s (involved in electron transport) and [[dolichol]]s (involved in [[glycoprotein]] formation).&lt;ref name="Lim_2010" /&gt; The apicoplast contains the [[Non-mevalonate pathway|MEP pathway]] for isoprenoid precursor synthesis and is the sole site for such synthesis in the ''Plasmodium'' cell.&lt;ref name="Lim_2010" /&gt;

===Heme synthesis===

The apicoplast has also been implicated with [[heme]] synthesis&lt;ref name="Ralph_2001"/&gt; and [[amino acid]] synthesis. It is also suggested to have a role in cell development. These functions, however, are merely postulations and are not yet conclusively supported by experimentation.&lt;ref name="Maréchal_2001"/&gt;

===Iron-sulphur cluster synthesis===

Various iron-sulphur cluster biosynthetic enzymes including SufB or Orf470 have been identified in the apicoplast genome.&lt;ref name="Lim_2010" /&gt;

Bridges for conveying water, called '''aqueducts''' or '''water bridges''', are constructed to convey [[watercourse]]s across gaps such as valleys or ravines. The term ''aqueduct'' may also be used to refer to the [[Aqueduct (water supply)|entire watercourse]], as well as the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;"aqueduct", Britannica CD 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Large [[navigable aqueduct]]s are used as transport links for [[boats]] or ships. Aqueducts must span a crossing at the same level as the watercourses on each end. The word is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''{{lang|la|aqua}}'' ("water") and ''{{lang|la|ducere}}'' ("to lead").&lt;ref&gt;"aqueduct", Britannica CD 2000&lt;/ref&gt; A modern version of an '''aqueduct''' is a [[pipeline bridge]].They may take the form of underground tunnels, networks of surface channels and canals, covered clay pipes or monumental bridges.

==Ancient bridges for water==
[[File:Mathur Hanging Trough Bridge.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mathur Aqueduct]], India]]
Although particularly associated with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], aqueducts were likely first used by the [[Minoans]] around 2000 BCE. The Minoans had developed what was then an extremely advanced [[irrigation system]], including several aqueducts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient.eu/article/319/ Minoan Aqueducts: A Pioneering Technology], ''ancient.eu''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventh century BCE, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] built an 80&amp;nbsp;km long limestone aqueduct, which included a 10 m high section to cross a 300 m wide valley, to carry water to their capital city, [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oip24.pdf Thorkild Jacobsen and Seton Lloyd, Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan, Oriental Institute Publication 24], [[University of Chicago Press]], 1935]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
{{Main|Roman aqueduct}}
Bridges were a distinctive feature of [[Roman aqueduct]]s which were built in all parts of the [[Roman Empire]], from Germany to Africa, and especially in the city of Rome, where they supplied water to public baths and for drinking. Roman aqueducts set a standard of engineering that was not surpassed for more than a thousand years.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Modern aqueducts==

===Navigable aqueducts===
{{Main|Navigable aqueduct}}
Navigable aqueducts, also called water bridges, are water-filled bridges to allow vessels on a [[waterway]] to cross ravines or valleys. During the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 18th century, navigable aqueducts were constructed as part of the boom in canal-building. A notable revolving aqueduct has been made on the [[Bridgewater Canal]]. This allowed vessels to cross at high and low levels while conserving water that would be lost in the operation of [[lock (water transport)|locks]].

'''''Heȟáka Sápa''''' ('''Black Elk''') (December 1, 1863&amp;nbsp;– August 19, 1950)&lt;ref&gt;Sources differ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--is a death certificate extant?--&gt; was a famous ''wičháša wakȟáŋ'' ([[medicine man]] and holy man) and [[heyoka]] of the Oglala [[Lakota people|Lakota]] (Sioux) who lived in the present-day United States, primarily [[South Dakota]]. He was a second cousin of the war chief [[Crazy Horse]].

Near the end of his life, Black Elk met with amateur ethnologist [[John Neihardt]] and recounted to him his religious vision, events from his life, and details of Lakota culture. Neihardt edited a translated record and published ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]'' in 1932. The words of Black Elk have since been published in numerous editions, most recently in 2008. There has been great interest in his work among members of the [[American Indian Movement]] since the 1970s and by others who have wanted to learn more about a Native American religion.

Black Elk's first wife Katie converted to [[Roman Catholicism]], and they had their three children [[baptized]] as [[Catholics]]. After Katie's death, in 1904 Black Elk, then in his 40s, converted to Catholicism. He also became a [[catechist]], teaching others about Christianity. He married again and had more children with his second wife; they were also baptized and reared as Catholic. He said his children "had to live in this world."&lt;ref name="sixth"/&gt; In August 2016, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rapid City]] opened an official cause for his [[beatification]] within the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsaints.faithweb.com/year/1950.htm#Black_Elk|title=1950|website=Newsaints.faithweb.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapidcitydiocese.org/|title=Diocese of Rapid City — The Catholic Church of western South Dakota|website=Diocese of Rapid City|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/another-vision-of-black-elk|title=Another Vision of Black Elk|first=Ian|last=Frazier|date=26 December 2017|accessdate=17 April 2018|website=Newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==
Black Elk was born into an Oglala [[Lakota people|Lakota]] family in December 1863 along the [[Powder River (Montana)|Little Powder River]] (at a site thought to be in the present-day state of Wyoming).&lt;ref name=DeMallie&gt;{{cite book|last=DeMallie|first=Raymond J|title=The Sixth Grandfather: Black Elk's teachings given to John G. Neihardt|date=1984|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=0-8032-1664-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} According to the Lakota way of measuring time (referred to as [[Winter counts]]), Black Elk was born in "the Winter When the Four [[Crow Indians|Crows]] Were Killed on [[Tongue River (Montana)|Tongue River]]".&lt;ref name=DeMallie/&gt;{{rp|101}}

==Vision==
When Black Elk was nine years old, he was suddenly taken ill; he lay prone and unresponsive for several days. During this time he had a great vision in which he was visited by the Thunder Beings (''Wakinyan''), and taken to the Grandfathers&amp;nbsp;— spiritual representatives of the six sacred directions: west, east, north, south, above, and below. These "... spirits were represented as kind and loving, full of years and wisdom, like revered human grandfathers."&lt;ref name=DeMallie/&gt;{{rp|preface}} When he was seventeen, Black Elk told a medicine man, Black Road, about the vision in detail. Black Road and the other medicine men of the village were "astonished by the greatness of the vision."&lt;ref name=DeMallie/&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

Black Elk had learned many things in his vision to help heal his people. He had come from a long line of medicine men and healers in his family; his father was a medicine man, as were his paternal uncles. Late in his life as an elder, he related to [[John G. Neihardt]] the vision that occurred to him. Among other things he saw a great tree that symbolized the life of the earth and all people.&lt;ref&gt;Neihardt, John, ed., ''Black Elk Speaks'', annotated edition, published by SUNY, 2008, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Neihardt recorded his account in great detail, later publishing it as ''Black Elk Speaks.'' Since the late twentieth century, Black Elk's words have received renewed attention, including from non-Lakota. An annotated edition was published by the State University of New York in 2008.

In his vision, Black Elk is taken to the center of the earth, and to the central mountain of the world.  [[Mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]] explains this recurring symbol among religions as "the ''axis mundi,'' the central point, the pole around which all revolves ... the point where stillness and movement are together ...." Black Elk was residing at the axis of the six sacred directions. Campbell viewed Black Elk's statement as key to understanding myth and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Power of Myth (with Bill Moyers)|author=Campbell, Joseph|page=111|year=1991|publisher=Anchor Books edition (non-illustrated smaller-format edition)|isbn=0-385-41886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Black Elk related:

{{quote|And while I stood there I saw more than I can tell and understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a sacred manner the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all shapes as they must live together like one being.  And I saw that the sacred hoop of my people was one of many hoops that made one circle, wide as daylight and as starlight, and in the center grew one mighty flowering tree to shelter all the children of one mother and one father.  And I saw that it was holy.&lt;ref name=DeMallie/&gt;{{rp|intro., 97}}|}}

Black Elk had many visions throughout his life, which reinforced what he had seen and felt as a boy. He worked among his people as a healer and medicine man.

== Battle of the Little Bighorn ==
Black Elk was present at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]]. He spoke about the battle to writer [[John Neihardt]]:

{{blockquote|There was a soldier on the ground and he was still kicking. A Lakota [Sioux] rode up and said to me, ‘Boy, get off and scalp him.’ I got off and started to do it. He had short hair and my knife was not very sharp. He ground his teeth. Then I shot him in the forehead and got his scalp.&amp;nbsp;... After awhile [on the battlefield] I got tired looking around. I could smell nothing but blood, and I got sick of it. So I went back home with some others. I was not sorry at all. I was a happy boy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

== Buffalo Bill's Wild West ==

In 1887, Black Elk traveled to England with ''[[Buffalo Bill's Wild West]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/07/28/buffalo_bill_salford_280705_feature.shtml|title=BBC - Manchester - Features : Tracking the Salford Sioux|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an experience he described in chapter twenty of ''[[Black Elk Speaks]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/Black-Elk-Speaks/Black-Elk-Speaks-Index.html|title=Black Elk Speaks : Index|website=Firstpeople.us|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 1887, the troupe put on a command performance for [[Queen Victoria]], whom they called "Grandmother England." Black Elk was among the crowd at her Golden Jubilee.&lt;ref&gt;"When she came to where we were, her wagon stopped and she stood up. Then all those people stood up and roared and bowed to her: "but she bowed to us." Neihardt, John, ed., ''Black Elk Speaks'', annotated edition, published by SUNY, 2008, pp. 176-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 1888, ''Buffalo Bill's Wild West'' set sail for the United States. Black Elk became separated from the group and the ship left without him, stranding him with three other Lakota. They subsequently joined another wild west show and he spent the next year touring in Germany, France, and Italy. When Buffalo Bill arrived in Paris in May 1889, Black Elk obtained a ticket to return home to Pine Ridge, arriving in autumn of 1889. During his sojourn in Europe, Black Elk was given an "abundant opportunity to study the white man's way of life," and he learned to speak rudimentary English.&lt;ref name=DeMallie/&gt;{{rp|9}}

==Wounded Knee Massacre==
Black Elk participated in the fighting at the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] in 1890. While on horseback, he charged soldiers and helped to rescue some of the wounded. He arrived after many of [[Spotted Elk]]'s (Big Foot's) band of people had been shot, and he was grazed by a bullet to his hip.&lt;ref name="Neihardt1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Gneisenau Neihardt|title=The Sixth Grandfather: Black Elk's Teachings Given to John G. Neihardt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXElCJTANaoC&amp;pg=PA274|year=1985|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=0-8032-6564-6|pages=274–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
For at least a decade, beginning in 1934, Black Elk returned to work related to his performances earlier in life with [[Buffalo Bill]]. He organized an Indian show to be held in the sacred [[Black Hills]]. But, unlike the Wild West shows, used to glorify Native American warfare, Black Elk created a show to teach tourists about Lakota culture and traditional sacred rituals, including the [[Sun Dance]].&lt;ref name="Neihardt2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=John G. Neihardt|title=Black Elk Speaks: Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7p9VqRLiKqcC|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=1 August 2008|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2538-2|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
[[File:Black Elk.jpg|thumb|Black Elk, daughter Lucy Black Elk, and second wife Anna Brings White in their home in [[Manderson, South Dakota|Manderson]], South Dakota, about 1910]]
Black Elk married his first wife, Katie War Bonnet, in 1892. She converted to [[Catholicism]], and all three of their children were baptized as Catholics.

His son, Benjamin Black Elk (1899–1973), became known as the "Fifth Face of [[Mount Rushmore]]", posing in the 1950s and 1960s for tourists at the memorial. Benjamin played an uncredited role in the 1962 film ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Dakota Images: Benjamin Black Elk | publisher = South Dakota Historical Society | year = 1984 | volume = 14 | number = 1 | last = Kilen Ode | first = Jeanne | url =http://www.sdhspress.com/journal/south-dakota-history-14-1/dakota-images-benjamin-black-elk/vol-14-no-1-dakota-images-benjamin-black-elk.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Katie's death in 1903, Black Elk became a Catholic the next year in 1904, when he was in his 40s. He was christened with the name of Nicholas and later served as a [[catechist]] in the church.&lt;ref name=DeMallie/&gt;{{rp|14}} &lt;ref name=Mails/&gt;{{rp|44}} After this, other medicine men, including his nephew [[Frank Fools Crow|Fools Crow]], referred to him both as Black Elk and Nicholas Black Elk.&lt;ref name=Mails&gt;{{cite book|last=Mails|first=Thomas E.|title=Fools Crow|date=1979|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NJ|isbn=0385113323}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}

The widower Black Elk married again in 1905 to Anna Brings White, a widow with two daughters. Together they had three more children, whom they also had baptized as Catholic. As he later said, his children had to live in "this world." (See below, account by Hilda Neihardt.)&lt;ref name="sixth"/&gt; The couple were together until her death in 1941.

Black Elk was a leader in the revival of the [[Sun Dance]] (an important religious ceremony among several tribes) and its reinstatement in Lakota life. Lakota traditionalists now follow his version of the dance.&lt;ref name="Holler2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clyde Holler|title=The Black Elk Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NUwUv67oRQcC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=24 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-2836-1|pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, Black Elk revealed the story of his life, and a number of sacred Sioux rituals to [[John Neihardt]] and [[Joseph Epes Brown]] for publication. Black Elk worked with Neihardt to give a first-hand account of his experiences and that of the Lakota people. His son Ben translated Black Elk's stories into English as he spoke. Neihardt's daughter Enid recorded these accounts. She later arranged them in chronological order for Neihardt's use. Thus the process had many steps and more people than Black Elk and Neihardt were involved in the recounting and recording.&lt;ref name="Holler2000"/&gt;

After Black Elk told Neihardt his vision over the course of several days, Neihardt asked why Black Elk had "put aside" his old religion. According to [Neihardt's daughter] Hilda, Black Elk replied, "My children had to live in this world."&lt;ref name="sixth"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sixth Grandfather: Black Elk's Teachings Given to John G. Neihardt|editor=DeMallie, Raymond J.|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=1985|page=47|isbn= 0-8032-6564-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1995 memoir, [[Hilda Neihardt]] wrote that just before his death, Black Elk took his pipe and told his daughter Lucy Looks Twice, "The only thing I really believe is the pipe religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Black Elk &amp; Flaming Rainbow: Personal Memories of the Lakota Holy Man and John Neihardt|author= Neihardt, Hilda|publisher= University of Nebraska Press|year = 1999 | orig-year=First published 1995| page= 119|isbn=0-8032-3338-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Record==
Since the 1970s, the book ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]'' has become an important source for studying Native spirituality. With the rise of Native American activism, there was increasing interest among many in their traditional religions. Within the [[American Indian Movement]], for instance, ''Black Elk Speaks'' was  an important source for those seeking religious and spiritual inspiration. They also sought out Black Elk's nephew [[Frank Fools Crow]], also a medicine man, for information on Native traditions.&lt;ref name="Holler2000"/&gt;
In the same period, there has been rising interest among non-Native Americans in Native culture and religions.

On August 11, 2016, the US Board on Geographic Names officially renamed Harney Peak, the highest point in South Dakota, Black Elk Peak in honor of Nicholas Black Elk and in recognition of the significance of the mountain to Native Americans.

On October 21, 2017, the cause for canonization for Nicholas Black Elk was formally opened by the Catholic Diocese of Rapid City, South Dakota, paving the way for the possibility of him one day being recognized as a saint. He is now designated as a "Servant of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/cause-opens-for-nicholas-black-elk-holy-man-of-the-lakota|title=Cause Opens for Nicholas Black Elk, Holy Man of the Lakota|website=Ncregister.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work to share the Gospel with Native and non-Native people and harmonize the faith with Lakota culture were noted at the Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/11/03/canonization-process-begins-black-elk-native-american-who-merged-lakota-and|title=Canonization process begins for Black Elk, the Native American who merged Lakota and Catholic culture|date=3 November 2017|website=Americanmagazine.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26646">'''[[Cancer pain]]''' can be caused by pressure on, or chemical stimulation of, specialised pain-signalling nerve endings called [[nociceptor]]s ([[nociceptive pain]]), or by damage or illness affecting [[Somatosensory system|nerve fibers]] themselves ([[neuropathic pain]]).&lt;ref name=Kurita&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kurita GP, Ulrich A, Jensen TS, Werner MU, Sjøgren P |title=How is neuropathic cancer pain assessed in randomised controlled trials? |journal=Pain |volume=153 |issue=1 |pages=13–7 |year=2012 |month=January |pmid=21903329|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2011.08.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infection==
Infection of a tumor or its surrounding tissue can cause rapidly escalating pain, but is sometimes overlooked as a possible cause. One study&lt;ref name = Gonzalez&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Gonzalez GR, Foley KM &amp; Portenoy RK | year = 1989 | Title = Evaluative skills necessary for a cancer pain consultant | journal = American Pain Society meeting, Phoenix Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that infection was the cause of pain in four percent of nearly 300 cancer patients referred for pain relief. Another report&lt;ref name = Bruera&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Bruera E &amp; MacDonald RN | title = Intractable pain in patients with advanced head and neck tumors: a possible role of local infection | journal = Cancer Treatment Reports | volume = 70 | pages = 691–2 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3708626 }}&lt;/ref&gt; described seven patients, whose previously well-controlled pain escalated significantly over several days. Antibiotic treatment produced pain relief in all patients within three days.&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;

==Tumor-related==
Tumors can cause pain by crushing or infiltrating tissue, or by releasing chemicals that make nociceptors responsive to stimuli that are normally non-painful (''cf.'' [[allodynia]]).

===Vascular events===
;Deep vein thrombosis
:Between 15 and 25 percent of [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing a vein). Cancers most likely to cause DVT are [[pancreatic cancer]], [[stomach cancer]], [[brain tumor]]s, advanced [[breast cancer]] and advanced [[pelvic tumor]]s. DVT may be the first hint that cancer is present. It causes swelling and pain (which varies from intense to vague cramp or "heaviness") in the legs, especially the calf, and (rarely) in the arms.&lt;ref name= Koh&amp;Portenoy/&gt;
;Superior vena cava syndrome
:The [[superior vena cava]] (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, most often [[non-small-cell lung carcinoma]] (50 percent), [[small-cell lung carcinoma]] (25 percent), lymphoma, or metastasis, causing [[superior vena cava syndrome]]. Common symptoms include [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], swelling of the face and neck, dilation of veins in the neck and chest, and chest wall pain.&lt;ref name= Koh&amp;Portenoy/&gt;&lt;ref name="M.D.Ballantyne2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gundamraj NR|author2= Richmeimer S|editor1-first= SM|editor1-last= Fishman|editor2-first= JC|editor2-last= Ballantyne |editor3-first=JP |editor3-last=Rathmell|chapter=Chest Wall Pain |title=Bonica's Management of Pain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pms0hxH8f-sC&amp;pg=PA1045|accessdate=10 June 2013|date=January 2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-6827-6|pages=1045–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nervous system===
Between 40 and 80 percent of patients with cancer pain experience neuropathic pain.&lt;ref name=Kurita/&gt;

'''Brain'''
:Brain tissue itself contains no nociceptors; [[brain tumor]]s cause pain by pressing on blood vessels or the membrane that encapsulates the brain (the [[meninges]]), or indirectly by causing a build-up of fluid ([[edema]]) that may compress pain-sensitive tissue.&lt;ref name = Fitzgibbon_&amp;_Loeser_34&gt;{{harvnb|Fitzgibbon|Loeser|2010|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meninges'''
:Ten percent of patients with cancer spreading to different parts of the body develop [[meningeal carcinomatosis]], where [[metastatic seedling]]s develop in the [[meninges]] (outer lining) of both the brain and spinal cord (with possible invasion of the brain or spinal cord). [[Melanoma]] and [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[lung cancer]] account for 90 percent of such cases. Back pain and headache&amp;nbsp;– often severe and possibly associated with nausea, vomiting, neck rigidity and pain or discomfort in the eyes due to light exposure ([[photophobia]])&amp;nbsp;– are frequently the first symptoms of meningeal carcinomatosis. "Pins and needles" ([[paresthesia]]), bowel or bladder dysfunction and lower [[motor neuron]] weakness are common features.&lt;ref name = Urch/&gt;

{{anchor | fig. 1}}
[[File:Gray82.png|thumb|right|alt=Drawing of a human vertebra|Fig. 1: A human vertebra showing body and pedicle]]
'''Spinal cord compression'''
:About three percent of cancer patients experience spinal cord compression, usually from expansion of the [[vertebral body]] or [[pedicle of vertebral arch|pedicle]] ([[#fig. 1|fig. 1]]) due to metastasis, sometimes involving collapse of the vertebral body. Occasionally compression is caused by nonvertebral metastasis adjacent to the spinal cord. Compression of the long tracts of the cord itself produces [[funicular pain]] and compression of a [[Posterior root of spinal nerve|spinal nerve root]] ([[#fig. 5|fig. 5]]) produces [[radicular pain]]. Seventy percent of cases involve the thoracic, 20 percent the [[Lumbar vertebrae|lumbar]], and 10 percent the [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical spine]]; and about 20 percent of cases involve multiple sites of compression. The nature of the pain depends on the location of the compression.&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;

'''Nerve infiltration or compression'''
:Infiltration or compression of a nerve by a primary tumor causes [[peripheral neuropathy]] in one to five percent of cancer patients.&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;

'''Dorsal root ganglion inflammation'''
:[[Small-cell carcinoma|Small-cell lung cancer]] and, less often, [[Breast cancer|cancer of the breast]], [[Colorectal cancer|colon]] or [[Ovarian cancer|ovary]] may produce inflammation of the [[dorsal root ganglion|dorsal root ganglia]] ([[#fig. 5|fig. 5]]), precipitating burning, tingling pain in the extremities, with occasional "lightning" or lancinating pains.&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;&lt;ref name = Foley&gt;{{vcite book | author = Foley KM | year = 2004 |chapter = Acute and chronic cancer pain syndromes | pages = 298–316 | title = Oxford textbook of palliative medicine | editor = Doyle D, Hanks G, Cherny N &amp; Calman K | publisher = OUP | location = Oxford | isbn = 0-19-851098-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brachial plexopathy'''
:[[Brachial plexopathy]] is a common product of [[Pancoast tumor]], [[lymphoma]] and [[breast cancer]], and can produce severe burning [[dysesthesia|dysesthesic]] pain on the back of the hand, and cramping, crushing forearm pain.&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;

===Bone===
{{ anchor |fig. 2}}
[[File:Illu pharynx.jpg|thumb|right|Fig. 2: Cross-section of the human head showing the nasopharynx]]
Invasion of bone by cancer is the most common source of cancer pain. About 70 percent of breast and [[prostate cancer]] patients, and 40 percent of those with [[Lung cancer|lung]], [[Kidney cancer|kidney]] and [[thyroid cancer]]s develop bone [[Metastasis|metastases]]. It is commonly felt as tenderness, with constant background pain and instances of spontaneous or movement-related exacerbation, and is frequently described as severe. Tumors in the marrow instigate a vigorous immune response which enhances pain sensitivity, and they release chemicals that stimulate nociceptors. As they grow, tumors compress, [[proteolysis|consume]], infiltrate or cut off blood supply to body tissues, which can cause pain.&lt;ref name = Twycross&gt;{{vcite book | author = Twycross R &amp; Bennett M | chapter = Cancer pain syndromes | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI &amp; Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | pages = 27–37 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Urch&gt;{{vcite book | author = Urch CE &amp; Suzuki R | chapter = Pathophysiology of somatic, visceral, and neuropathic cancer pain | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI &amp; Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | pages = 3–12 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fracture'''
:Rib fractures, common in breast, prostate and other cancers with rib metastases, can cause brief severe pain on twisting the trunk, coughing, laughing, breathing deeply or moving between sitting and lying.&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt; In breast, prostate or lung cancer, multiple myeloma and some other cancers, sudden onset limb or back pain may indicate pathological bone fracture (most often in the upper [[femur]]).&lt;ref name= Koh&amp;Portenoy/&gt;

'''Skull'''
:The base of the skull may be affected by metastases from cancer of the [[bronchus]], breast or prostate, or cancer may spread directly to this area from the [[nasopharynx]] ([[#fig. 2|fig. 2]]), and this may cause headache, facial paresthesia, [[dysesthesia]] or pain, or cranial nerve dysfunction&amp;nbsp;– the exact symptoms depend on the cranial nerves impacted.&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;

===Pelvis===
Pain produced by cancer within the pelvis varies depending on the affected tissue, but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper thigh, and may [[referred pain|refer]] to the [[lumbar]] region. [[Lumbosacral plexus|Lumbosacral]] [[plexopathy]] is often caused by recurrence of cancer in the [[presacral space]], and may refer to the external genitalia or [[perineum]]. Local recurrence of cancer attached to the side of the [[pelvic wall]] may cause pain in one of the [[iliac fossa]]e. Pain on walking that confines the patient to bed indicates possible cancer adherence to or invasion of the [[iliacus muscle]]. Pain in the [[hypogastrium]] (between the navel and [[pubis (bone)|pubic bone]]) is often found in cancers of the uterus and bladder, and sometimes in [[colorectal cancer]] especially if infiltrating or attached to either uterus or bladder.&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;

===Viscera===
[[Visceral pain]] is diffuse and difficult to locate, and is often referred to more distant, usually superficial, sites.&lt;ref name = Urch/&gt;

'''Liver'''
:Acute hemorrhage into a [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] causes severe upper right quadrant pain, and may be life-threatening, requiring emergency surgery or other emergency intervention.&lt;ref name= Koh&amp;Portenoy&gt;{{cite book |last1= Koh|first1= M|last2= Portenoy|first2= RK| editor=Bruera ED &amp; Portenoy RK |title= Cancer Pain Syndromes|year= 2010|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 9780511640483 |pages=53–85 |chapter=Cancer Pain Syndromes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; A tumor can expand the size of the liver several times and consequent stretching of its [[Fibrous capsule of Glisson|capsule]] can cause aching pain in the right [[hypochondrium]]. Other causes of pain in [[Hepatomegaly|enlarged liver]] are traction of the supporting ligaments when standing or walking, the liver pressing against the rib cage or pinching the wall of the abdomen, and straining the lumbar spine. In some postures the liver may pinch the parietal [[peritoneum]] against the lower rib cage, producing sharp, transitory pain, relieved by changing position. The tumor may also infiltrate the liver's capsule, causing dull, and sometimes stabbing pain.&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;
'''Kidneys and spleen'''
:Cancer of the kidneys and spleen produces less pain than that caused by liver tumor&amp;nbsp;– kidney tumors eliciting pain only once the organ has been almost totally destroyed and the cancer has invaded the surrounding tissue or adjacent pelvis. Pressure on the kidney or [[ureter]] from a tumor outside the kidney can cause extreme flank pain.&lt;ref name = Fitzgibbon_&amp;_Loeser_34/&gt; Local recurrence of cancer after the removal of a kidney can cause pain in the lumbar back, or [[Lumbar spinal nerve 1|L1]] or [[Lumbar spinal nerve 2|L2]] spinal nerve pain in the groin or upper thigh, accompanied by weakness and numbness of the [[iliopsoas]] muscle, exacerbated by activity.&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;
'''Abdominal and urogenital hollow organs'''
:Inflammation of artery walls and tissue adjacent to nerves is common in tumors of abdominal and urogenital hollow organs.&lt;ref name = Fitzgibbon_&amp;_Loeser_35&gt;{{harvnb|Fitzgibbon|Loeser|2010|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infection or cancer may irritate the [[trigone of the urinary bladder]], causing spasm of the [[detrusor urinae muscle]] (the muscle that squeezes urine from the [[urinary bladder]]), resulting in deep pain above the pubic bone, possibly referred to the tip of the penis, lasting from a few minutes to half an hour.&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;
'''Gastrointestinal'''
:The pain of intestinal tumors may be the result of disturbed [[motility]], dilation, altered blood flow or [[ulcer]]ation. [[Lymphoma|Malignant lymphomas]] of the gastrointestinal tract can produce large tumors with significant ulceration and bleeding.&lt;ref name = Fitzgibbon_&amp;_Loeser_35/&gt;
'''Respiratory system'''
:Cancer in the [[bronchial tree]] is usually painless,&lt;ref name = Fitzgibbon_&amp;_Loeser_35/&gt; but ear and facial pain on one side of the head has been reported in some patients. This pain is referred via the [[auricular branch of vagus nerve|auricular branch of the vagus nerve]].&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;{{anchor | fig. 3}}[[File:Illu pancreas duodenum.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Drawing of the pancreas|Fig. 3 The [[pancreas]]: 1. pancreatic head; 4. pancreatic body; 11. pancreatic tail]]
'''Pancreas'''
:Ten percent of patients with cancer of the [[pancreatic body]] or [[Tail of pancreas|tail]] experience pain, whereas 90 percent of those with cancer of the pancreatic [[Head of pancreas|head]] will, especially if the tumor is near the [[hepatopancreatic ampulla]]. The pain appears on the left or right upper abdomen, is constant, and increases in intensity over time. It is in some cases relieved by leaning forward and heightened by lying on the stomach. Back pain may be present and, if intense, may spread left and right. Back pain may be referred from the pancreas, or may indicate the cancer has penetrated [[paraspinal muscle]], or entered the [[retroperitoneum]] and [[paraaortic lymph node]]s&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;
'''Rectum'''
:A local tumor in the [[rectum]] or recurrence involving the [[Superior hypogastric plexus|presacral plexus]] may cause pain normally associated with an urgent need to defecate. This pain may, rarely, return as [[phantom pain]] after surgical removal of the rectum, though pain within a few weeks of surgical removal of the rectum is usually neuropathic pain due to the surgery (described in one study&lt;ref name = Boas&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Boas RA, Schug SA &amp; Acland RH | title = Perineal pain after rectal amputation: A 5 year follow up | journal = Pain | year = 1993 | volume = 52 | pages = 62–70 | pmid = 8446438 | doi=10.1016/0304-3959(93)90115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as spontaneous, intermittent, mild to moderate shooting and bursting, or tight and aching), and pain emerging after three months (described as deep, sharp, aching, intense, and continuous, made worse by sitting or pressure) usually signals recurrence of the disease. The emergence of pain on standing or walking (described as "dragging") may indicate a deeper recurrence involving attachment to muscle or [[fascia]].&lt;ref name = Twycross/&gt;

===Serous mucosa===
[[Carcinosis]] of the [[peritoneum]] may cause pain through inflammation, disordered visceral motility, or pressure of the metastases on nerves. Once a tumor has penetrated or perforated hollow viscera, acute inflammation of the peritoneum appears, inducing severe abdominal pain. [[Pleura]]l [[carcinomatosis]] is normally painless.&lt;ref name = Fitzgibbon_&amp;_Loeser_35/&gt;

===Soft tissue===
Invasion of soft tissue by a tumor can cause pain by inflammatory or mechanical stimulation of nociceptors, or destruction of mobile structures such as ligaments, tendons and skeletal muscles.&lt;ref name = Fitzgibbon_&amp;_Loeser_35/&gt;

==Diagnostic procedures==
{{anchor | fig. 5}}
[[File:Gray770-en.svg|thumb|right|alt=Drawing of cross-section of spinal cord|Fig. 5: Cross section of the spinal cord showing the subarachnoid cavity, dura mater and spinal nerve roots including the dorsal root [[ganglion]]]]
Some diagnostic procedures, such as [[venipuncture]], [[paracentesis]], and [[thoracentesis]] can be painful.&lt;ref name=IASP&gt;[http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=7191 International Association for the Study of Pain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928121554/http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;Template=%2FCM%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=7191 |date=2011-09-28 }} Treatment-Related Pain&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lumbar puncture'''
:In [[lumbar puncture]] a needle is inserted between two [[lumbar vertebra]]e, through the ''[[dura mater]]'' and [[arachnoid membrane]] surrounding the spinal cord, into the fluid-flled space between the arachnoid membrane and the spinal cord (the subarachnoid cavity), and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CFS) is withdrawn for examination. In one study, 14 percent of patients felt pain on lumbar puncture.&lt;ref name = Abraham&gt;{{vcite book | author = Abraham JL | title = A physician's guide to pain and symptom management in cancer patients | page = 108 | edition = 2 | year = 2005 | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn = 0801881013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[#fig. 5|fig. 5]])
'''Post-dural-puncture headache'''
:In some patients, subsequent leakage of CSF through the ''dura mater'' puncture causes reduced CSF levels in the brain and spinal cord, leading to the development of [[post-dural-puncture headache]] (PDPH) hours or days later. Onset occurs within two days in 66 percent and within three days in ninety percent of PDPH cases. It occurs so rarely immediately after puncture that other possible causes should be investigated when it does.&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turnbull GK, Shepherd DB| year = 2003 | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | title = Post‐dural puncture headache: pathogenesis, prevention and treatment | volume =  91| issue = 5 | url = http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/91/5/718.long | doi = 10.1093/bja/aeg231 | pages = 718–729 | pmid=14570796}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The headache is severe and described as "searing and spreading like hot metal," involving the back and front of the head, and spreading to the neck and shoulders, sometimes involving neck stiffness. It is exacerbated by movement, and sitting or standing, and relieved to some degree by lying down. Nausea, vomiting, pain in arms and legs, hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, dizziness and [[paraesthesia]] of the scalp are common.&lt;ref name=Turnbull/&gt;

==Treatment-related==
Potentially painful cancer treatments include [[immunotherapy]] which may produce joint or muscle pain; radiotherapy, which can cause skin reactions, [[enteritis]], fibrosis, [[myelopathy]], bone [[necrosis]], [[neuropathy]] or [[plexopathy]]; chemotherapy, often associated with [[mucositis]], [[arthralgia|joint pain]], [[myalgia|muscle pain]], peripheral neuropathy and abdominal pain due to diarrhea or constipation; hormone therapy, which sometimes causes pain flares; targeted therapies, such as [[trastuzumab]] and [[rituximab]], which can cause muscle, joint or chest pain; [[angiogenesis inhibitor]]s like [[bevacizumab]], known to sometimes cause bone pain; and surgery, which may produce post-operative pain, post-amputation pain or pelvic floor myalgia.

===Chemotherapy===
[[File:Chemotherapy bottles NCI.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Six medicine bottles.|Fig. 4: Chemotherapy drugs]]

Chemotherapy may cause mucositis, muscle pain, joint pain, abdominal pain caused by diarrhea or constipation, and peripheral neuropathy&lt;ref name=IASP/&gt;

'''Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy'''
:Between 30 and 40 percent of patients undergoing chemotherapy experience [[chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy]] (CIPN): tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs.&lt;ref name=NCI&gt;{{vcite journal | author = del Pino BM | date = Feb 23, 2010 | journal = NCI Cancer Bulletin | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | page = 6 | title = Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy | url = http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/ncicancerbulletin/archive/2010/022310/page6 | accessdate = 2014-06-19 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111211105234/http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/ncicancerbulletin/archive/2010/022310/page6# | archivedate = 2011-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include [[thalidomide]], the [[epothilone]]s such as [[ixabepilone]], the [[vinca alkaloid]]s [[vincristine]] and [[vinblastine]], the [[taxane]]s [[paclitaxel]] and [[docetaxel]], the [[proteasome inhibitor]]s such as [[bortezomib]], and the platinum-based drugs [[cisplatin]], [[oxaliplatin]] and [[carboplatin]].&lt;ref name = NCI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kup.at/kup/pdf/10376.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ehealthme.com/ds/herceptin/peripheral%20sensory%20neuropathy&lt;/ref&gt; Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, is determined by the choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount consumed and whether the patient already has peripheral neuropathy. Though the symptoms are mainly sensory – pain, tingling, numbness and temperature sensitivity – in some cases [[motor nerve]]s are affected, and occasionally, also, the [[autonomic nervous system]].&lt;ref name=Beijers&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Beijers AJM, Jongen, JLM &amp; Vreugdenhil1 G | date = January 2012 | journal = The Netherlands Journal of Medicine | volume = 70 | issue = 1 | pmid = 22271810 | url = http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?id=10000794 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001320/http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?id=10000794 | archivedate = 2013-12-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:CIPN often follows the first chemotherapy dose and increases in severity as treatment continues, but this progression usually levels off at completion of treatment. The platinum-based drugs are the exception; with these drugs, sensation may continue to deteriorate for several months after the end of treatment.&lt;ref name= Windebank&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Windebank AJ &amp; Grisold W | title = Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy | journal =  Journal of the Peripheral Nervous System | date = 2008 Mar | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–46 | pmid = 18346229 | doi=10.1111/j.1529-8027.2008.00156.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some CIPN appears to be irreversible.&lt;ref name= Windebank/&gt; Pain can often be helped with drug or other treatment but the numbness is usually resistant to treatment.&lt;ref name=Savage&gt;{{vcite journal | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute| title = Chemotherapy-induced pain puzzles scientists | volume = 99 | issue = 14 | author = Savage L | date = 2007 | url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/14/1070.long | pages = 1070–1071 | doi=10.1093/jnci/djm072 | pmid=17623791}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 American study found that most patients did not recall being told to expect CIPN, and doctors monitoring the condition rarely asked how it affects daily living but focused on practical effects such as dexterity and gait.&lt;ref name = Paice&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Paice JA, Ferrell B | title = The management of cancer pain | journal = CA&amp;nbsp;– A Cancer Journal for Clinicians | year = 2011 | volume = 61| issue = 3 | pages = 157–82 | pmid = 21543825 | doi = 10.3322/caac.20112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Mucositis'''
:Cancer drugs can cause changes in the biochemistry of mucous membranes resulting in intense pain in the mouth, throat, nasal passages, and gastrointestinal tract. This pain can make talking, drinking, or eating difficult or impossible.&lt;ref name = Fitzgibbon_&amp;_Loeser_39&gt;{{harvnb|Fitzgibbon|Loeser|2010|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muscle and joint pain'''
:Withdrawal of steroid medication can cause joint pain and diffuse muscle pain accompanied by fatigue; these symptoms resolve with recommencement of steroid therapy. Chronic steroid therapy can result in aseptic necrosis of the humoral or femoral head, resulting in shoulder or knee pain described as dull and aching, and reduced movement in or inability to use arm or hip. Aromatase inhibitors can cause diffuse muscle and joint pain and stiffness, and may increase the likelihood of osteoporosis and consequent fractures.&lt;ref name = Fitzgibbon_&amp;_Loeser_39/&gt;

===Radiotherapy===
Radiotherapy may affect the connective tissue surrounding nerves, and may damage or kill white or gray matter in the brain or spinal cord.

'''Fibrosis around the brachial or [[Radiation-induced lumbar plexopathy#Pathophysiology|lumbosacral plexus]]'''
:Radiotherapy may produce excessive growth of the fibrous tissue  ([[fibrosis]]) around the [[brachial plexus|brachial]] or [[lumbosacral plexus|lumbosacral plexui]] (clusters of nerves), which can result in damage to the nerves over time (6 months to 20 years). This nerve damage may cause numbness, "pins and needles" (dysesthesia) and weakness in the affected limb. If pain develops, it is described as diffuse, severe, burning pain, increasing over time, in part or all of the affected limb.&lt;ref name = Fitzgibbon_&amp;_Loeser_39/&gt;
'''Spinal cord damage'''
:If radiotherapy includes the spinal cord, changes may occur which do not become apparent until some time after treatment. "Early delayed radiation-induced myelopathy" can manifest from six weeks to six months after treatment; the usual symptom is a [[Lhermitte sign]] ("a brief, unpleasant sensation of numbness, tingling and often electric-like discharge going from the neck to the spine and extremities, triggered by neck flexion"), usually followed by improvement two to nine months after onset, though in some cases symptoms persist for a long time. "Late delayed radiation-induced myelopathy" may occur six months to ten years after treatment. The typical presentation is [[Brown-Séquard syndrome]] (movement problems and numbness to touch and vibration on one side of the body and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the other). Onset may be sudden but is usually progressive. Some patients improve and others deteriorate.&lt;ref name = Fitzgibbon_&amp;_Loeser_102-3&gt;{{harvnb|Fitzgibbon|Loeser|2010|pp=102–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caving]] in [[New Zealand]] is an established hobby as well as being a part of commercial tourism.

Recreational caving is practised by several hundred members of caving associations all over New Zealand, who take advantage of the widespread [[limestone]] [[karst]] cave systems present in the country, especially in the [[Waitomo District]] of the North Island and in the [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]]-[[Tasman, New Zealand|Tasman]] region of the South Island. There are also several hundred thousands of visitors to various tourist caves in New Zealand per year,&lt;ref name="TOUR"&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/BushAndMountainRecreation/Caving/2/en Caving tourism] (from [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]. Accessed 2008-06-16.)&lt;/ref&gt; though a majority of these trips would not properly be called [[caving]].

== History ==

=== Overview ===
New Zealand caving as an exploratory sport is thought to have started with a group of [[Auckland]]-area people who started to explore the [[lava cave]]s in the volcanic cones of the area in the 1940s (though commercialised trips through caves at [[Waitomo Caves]] had actually already existed for several decades). The group quickly progressed to exploring caves in the [[Waikato]] and [[King Country]] areas, and the New Zealand Speleological Society was founded in 1949 by Henry Lambert, with the first rough facilities at Waitomo being established in 1955.&lt;ref name="CAVE"&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/BushAndMountainRecreation/Caving/3/en Caving in New Zealand] (from [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]])&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the discovery of [[Harwood's Hole]] in the South Island was to fully establish New Zealand as a country with extremely promising cave systems, and the cave with its 183 metre deep vertical entry shaft, and its passages extending for many hundreds of meters into the depths, was for a long time the deepest and most famous non-commercial cave in New Zealand. The area around Nelson also contains most of New Zealand's deepest caves (most discovered in the following decades), including [[Bulmer Cavern]], a 70&amp;nbsp;km long cave system.&lt;ref name="CAVE"/&gt;

New Zealand's cavers are mostly organised in the [[New Zealand Speleological Society]] (NZSS), with 9 affiliated caving clubs with a total of 300 members all over the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caves.org.nz/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NZSS/History History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016100015/http://caves.org.nz/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NZSS/History |date=2007-10-16 }} (from the [[New Zealand Speleological Society]] website. Retrieved 2007-10-08)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accidents and rescues ===

There have been a number of notable caving accidents since the 1940s, and at least four deaths {{as of|2007|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name="EQUIP"&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/BushAndMountainRecreation/Caving/4/en Caving equipment and culture] (from [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]])&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 1960, Peter Lambert was killed by falling rocks while being winched out of Harwoods hole,&lt;ref name="RRCPC"&gt;[http://www.rrcpc.org.uk/newsletters/NL_V36_N2_A3.htm Edgar Sixtus - One of the Early Cave Personalities] (from Red Rose Cave and Pothole Club Newsletter
Volume 36 Number 2 Article 3 June 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1995, Dave Weaver drowned while [[cave diving]] in Pearse Resurgence near Nelson.&lt;ref name="CAVE"/&gt;

In 1998, one of the most active cavers of the country, Kieran McKay, broke his jaw in Bulmer Cavern on Mt Owen. While the cavern has few squeezes and crawls, the operation to retrieve him from deep within the cave occupied around 80 cavers (in direct position or as support) from all over the country for several days.&lt;ref name="EQUIP"/&gt;

In 2007, Michael Brewer, another experienced caver, was struck by falling rock deep within the Greenlink-Middle Earth cave, in an incident which attracted widespread media attention in the country. Brewer suffered cracked ribs, concussion, and a broken pelvis. It took about 3 days to get him to the surface (a 3&amp;nbsp;km distance normally taking 5 hours), and while most of the distance was covered with Brewer on a [[stretcher]], and several tight squeezes were widened with explosives, he had to be pushed and pulled through some sections. The effort involved more than 50 cavers and cost around NZ$100,000.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10460456"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=13&amp;objectid=10460456 |title=Battered cave doctor glad to be alive |author=Cheng, Derek |date=29 August 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Jane Furket, a 28-year-old experienced recreational caver and member of the Nelson Caving Club, fell in the Luckie Strike cave west of [[Waitomo]]. She broke her hip and lost three teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rescuers crawl into cave to save woman|date=2008-11-07|publisher=Dominion Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand [[cave rescue]]s are undertaken by [[Search and rescue|SAR]] teams composed of experienced cavers who have also undergone specialised training courses and exercises.

==Caves==
{{Main|List of caves of New Zealand}}
As well as lava caves in the [[Auckland volcanic field]] there are numerous limestone caves in the [[North Island]], with the most well known being the [[Waitomo Caves]]. The longest and deepest caves are in the [[Kahurangi National Park]] in the [[South Island]]

==Commercial caving operations==
New Zealand offers a number of [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]] activities and one of them is caving. Most of the commercial caving is done in the [[Waitomo]] area, but there are also tours offered in [[Fiordland]] and on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]]. Black water rafting, where the participants float through caves on tyre inner tubes, was an early tourism venture and has become extremely popular.

[[File:ExplainingCaseControlSJW.jpg|thumb|Author: Kelidimari]]
In [[statistics]], [[marketing]]  and [[demography]], a '''cohort''' is a group of [[research subject|subjects]] who share a defining characteristic (typically subjects who experienced a common event in a selected time period, such as birth or graduation).

Cohort data can oftentimes be more advantageous to [[Demography|demographers]] than period data. Because cohort data is honed to a specific time period, it is usually more accurate. It is more accurate because it can be tuned to retrieve custom data for a specific study.

In addition, cohort data is not affected by [[tempo effect]]s, unlike period data. On the contrary; cohort data can be disadvantageous in the sense that it can take a long amount of time to collect the data necessary for the [[cohort study]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713_CohortStudies/EP713_CohortStudies5.html|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Cohort Studies|website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage of cohort studies is that it can be extremely costly to carry out, since the study will go on for a long period of time, demographers often require sufficient funds to fuel the study.

Demography often contrasts [[cohort perspective]]s and [[period perspective]]s. For instance, the total cohort [[fertility rate]] is an index of the average completed family size for cohorts of women, but since it can only be known for women who have finished child-bearing, it cannot be measured for currently fertile women. It can be calculated as the sum of the cohort's age-specific fertility rates that obtain as it ages through time. In contrast, the total period fertility rate uses current age-specific fertility rates to calculate the completed family size for a notional woman, were she to experience these fertility rates through her life.

A study on a cohort is a [[cohort study]].

Two important aspects of cohort studies are: 
# Prospective Cohort Study:  In this type of study, there is a collection of exposure data (baseline data) from the subjects recruited before development of the outcomes of interest. The subjects are then followed through time (future) to record when the subject develops the outcome of interest. Ways to follow-up with subjects of the study include: phone interviews, face-to-face interviews, physical exams, medical/laboratory tests, and mail questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713_CohortStudies/EP713_CohortStudies_print.html|title=Cohort Studies|website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a prospective cohort study is, for instance, if a demographer wanted to measure all the males births in the year 2018. The demographer would have to wait for the event to be over, the year 2018 must come to an end in order for the demographer to have all the necessary data.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statsref.com/HTML/index.html?cohort_studies2.html|title=Statistical Analysis Handbook|website=www.statsref.com|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Retrospective Cohort Study: Retrospective Studies start with subjects that are at risk to have the outcome or disease of interest and identifies the outcome starting from where the subject is when the study starts to the past of the subject to identify the exposure. Retrospective use records: clinical, educational, birth certificates, death certificates, etc. but that may be difficult because there may not be data for the study that is being initiated. These studies may have multiple exposures which may make this study difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713_CohortStudies/EP713_CohortStudies_print.html|title=Cohort Studies|website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an example of a retrospective cohort study is, if a demographer was examining a group of people born in year 1970 who have type 1 diabetes. The demographer would begin by looking at historical data. However, if the demographer was looking at ineffective data in attempts to deduce the source of type 1 diabetes, the demographers results would not be accurate.

The '''Dell Medical School''' is the graduate [[medical school]] of [[The University of Texas at Austin]] in Austin, Texas. The school opened to the inaugural class of 50 students in the summer of 2016 as the newest of 18 colleges and schools on the UT Austin campus.&lt;ref name="About us"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.utexas.edu/dell-medical-school/about-us | format= | title=Dell Medical School – About Us | work=utexas.edu | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; S. Claiborne "Clay" Johnston, [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of philosophy|Ph.D.]], was named as the medical school's inaugural [[Dean (education)|dean]] in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.utexas.edu/2014/01/21/dell-medical-school-dean | format= | title=Inaugural Dean Named at UT Austin's Dell Medical School | work=utexas.edu | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the Medical District Master Plan released in 2013, the University's portion of the medical district is being constructed in three phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.utexas.edu/operations/masterplan/documents/MedicalDistrict20130509.pdf | format=PDF | title=Medical District Master Plan | work=utexas.edu | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.utexas.edu/2013/05/08/dell-medical-school-construction-plans-unveiled | title=Dell Medical School Construction Plans Unveiled | work=utexas.edu | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new medical campus will sit on existing University property at the southeastern corner of the central campus, adjacent to the existing UT School of Nursing and to the Dell Seton Medical Center at The University of Texas—the new $295 million, 211-bed [[teaching hospital]] that [[Seton Healthcare Family|Seton Healthcare]] is building.&lt;ref name="About us" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seton.net/about_seton/news/2014/04/17/seton_medical_center_at_the_university_of_texas_will_be_name_of_new_teaching_hospital | title='Seton Medical Center at The University of Texas' Will be Name of New Teaching Hospital  | work=seton.net | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, Texas Senator Kirk Watson created a list of ten health-care centered goals he hoped to achieve within ten years for his Central Texas district.  Number one on that list was to build a medical school.  In May 2012, the Board of Regents allocated $25 million of annual funding to a UT Austin medical school, plus another $40 million spread over eight years for faculty recruiting.  In November 2012, Travis County voters approved a proposition to raise property tax revenue in support of health care initiatives for Central Texas, including $35 million annually for a medical school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Us {{!}} Dell Medical School|url = http://dellmedschool.utexas.edu/about|website = dellmedschool.utexas.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical school is named after the [[Michael &amp; Susan Dell Foundation]], which has pledged $50 million over ten years to the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dellmedschool.utexas.edu/about |format= |title=About Dell Medical School |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diving regulations''' are the stipulations of the [[delegated legislation]] regarding the practice of [[underwater diving]].

==Scope==
The scope of diving regulations is generally defined in each specific set of regulations and the statutory law which empowers them, which can vary considerably across jurisdictions.

Diving regulations apply within the national territorial waters of the country.

==Alternatives==
Diving regulations apply within the national territorial waters of the country. In general they do not apply in international waters, but the commercial diving industry operates in international waters, in what is generally known as the offshore diving industry. In these waters the industry is largely self-regulated through voluntary membership of organisations such as the [[International Marine Contractors Association]] (IMCA). Members of these organisations are required as a condition of membership to comply with their Codes of Practice.

In some jurisdictions specific exemptions and exceptions may be stipulated. For example:
*In the US, the [[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] (AAUS) is responsible for the promulgation of the AAUS Standards for Scientific Diving Certification and Operation of Scientific Diving Programs.&lt;ref name="AAUS Standards" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharkey and Austin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Federal regulation" /&gt;  These are the consensual guidelines for scientific diving programs in the US, and are recognized by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] as the "Standard" for scientific diving.
*In the US and South Africa, the recreational diver training and certification industry (professional [[recreational diving instructor]]s) and the recreational diving tour guide and [[dive leader]] (professional [[divemaster]]s) part of the recreational diving industry are excluded from the diving regulations as being part of a self-regulated industry.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt; The organisations involved include the [[World Recreational Scuba Training Council]] (WRSTC) and the [[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques#Technical committee|Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques Technical committee]].
*The [[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques#Scientific committee|Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques Scientific committee]] was responsible for the development of the "[[Code of Practice for Scientific Diving: Principles for the Safe Practice of Scientific Diving in Different Environments]]" for [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref name="Flemming" /&gt;

==Examples==

'''Canada'''

'''South Africa''' – Diving regulations to the Occupational Health and Safety Act, authorised by the Minister of Labour.&lt;ref name="OHSA 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt; 
The South African diving regulations regulate professional diving using breathing apparatus, and specifically exclude instruction of recreational divers and recreational dive leadership.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt; They apply only where the Occupational Health and Safety Act applies, so do not cover diving in minerals and energy industries, which have different safety legislation.

A '''firearm malfunction''' is the failure of a [[firearm]] to operate as intended for causes other than user error. Malfunctions range from temporary and relatively safe situations, such as a [[casing (ammunition)|casing]] that didn't eject, to potentially dangerous occurrences that may permanently damage the [[gun]] and cause injury or death.  Improper handling of certain types of malfunctions can be very dangerous. The basic rules of firearms safety should be followed at all times to minimize the risk to shooters and bystanders. &lt;ref name="NRA - Safety Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=NRA GUN SAFETY RULES|url=https://gunsafetyrules.nra.org/|website=gunsafetyrules.nra.org|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper cleaning and [[Firearm maintenance|maintenance]] of a firearm plays a big role in preventing malfunctions. &lt;ref name="USACarry - Handgun Malfunctions"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Findley|first1=Ben|title=Handgun Malfunctions and Stoppages|url=http://www.usacarry.com/handgun-malfunctions-stoppages/|website=usacarry.com|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cartridge malfunctions ==


=== Case head separation ===
Case head separation occurs when the walls of the casing become thin or fatigued. Upon firing the round, the case separates into two pieces near the head. It is not uncommon with brass that has been [[Handloading|reloaded]] several times.{{CN|date=March 2017}}

===Dud===
{{main|Dud}}
A dud (also a misfire or failure to fire) occurs when the trigger is pulled but the primer or powder in the cartridge malfunctions, causing the firearm not to discharge. Dud rounds can still be dangerous and should be deactivated and disposed of properly.  {{cn|date=March 2017}}

=== Hang fire ===
{{main|Hang fire}}
A hang fire (also delayed discharge) is an unexpected delay between the triggering of a firearm and the ignition of the [[propellant]]. Whenever a firearm fails to fire, but has not clearly malfunctioned, a hang fire should be suspected. When this occurs, the correct procedure is to keep the firearm pointed downrange or in a safe direction for thirty to sixty seconds, then remove and safely discard the round (which is now a dud as explained above if the primer was struck, otherwise the gun itself may have malfunctioned). The reason for this is that a round functioning outside of the firearm, or in the firearm with the action open ([[Out-of-battery|out-of-battery]] discharge), could cause a serious fragmentation hazard.

=== Squib load ===
{{main|Squib load}}

A squib load (also squib round, squib, squib fire, insufficient discharge, incomplete discharge) is an extremely dangerous malfunction that happens when a fired projectile does not carry enough force and becomes stuck in the [[gun barrel]] instead of exiting it. In the case of semi-automatic or automatic weapons, this can cause subsequent rounds to impact the projectile obstructing the barrel, which can cause a [[catastrophic failure]] of the structural integrity of the firearm, posing a threat to the operator or bystanders.  The bullet from a squib stuck in the barrel must never be cleared by subsequently attempting to fire a live or blank round into an obstructed barrel.  Blank rounds use a type of powder different from that of other rounds, and generate much more pressure, which, combined with the presence of the projectile obstructing the barrel may cause the firearm to fail catastrophically.

== Mechanical malfunctions ==

Mechanical malfunctions of a firearm (commonly called jams)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Edmund G. |authorlink =Jerry Brown |title =Handgun Safety Certificate |publisher =[[California Department of Justice]] |volume = |edition = |date =2009 |location =[[West Sacramento, California]] |page =52 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; include failures to feed, extract, or eject a cartridge; failure to fully cycle after firing; and failure of a recoil- or gas-operated firearm to lock back when empty (largely a procedural hazard, as "slide lock" is a visual cue that the firearm is empty). In extreme cases, an overloaded round, blocked barrel, poor design and/or severely weakened breech can result in an explosive failure of the receiver, barrel, or other parts of the firearm.

=== Failure to feed ===
{{Disputed-section|date=March 2017}}
Failure to Feed (FTF) is when a firearm fails to feed the next round into the firing chamber.  Failure to feed is common when the shooter does not hold the firearm firmly (known as [[limp wristing]]), when the slide is not fully cycled by the preceding round, or due to problems with the magazine.  It can also be caused by worn recoil springs, buffer springs, or simply a dirty feed ramps.

=== Hammer follow ===

Hammer follow occurs when the disconnector allows the hammer to follow the bolt and firing pin into battery, sometimes causing the firing mechanism to function without pulling the trigger. This is usually a result of extreme wear or outright breakage of firing mechanism components, and can result in uncontrollable "full-auto" operation, in which multiple rounds are discharged following a single pull of the trigger.

=== Slamfire ===

{{main|Slamfire}}
A slamfire is a premature, unintended discharge of a firearm that occurs as a [[Cartridge (firearms)|round]] is being loaded into the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]], when the bolt "slams" forward (hence the name), as a result of the firing pin having not been retracted into the bolt, or from the firing pin being carried forward by the momentum of returning to battery.  Similarly to a hammer follow malfunction, this can result in uncontrollable "full-auto" operation.

=== Failure to extract ===
A failure to extract occurs when the casing of the just-fired round is not successfully extracted from the chamber.  This can be caused by an overly-dirty chamber, broken extractor claw, case rim failures, or several other causes.

=== Failure to eject ===
A failure to eject (FTE) occurs when the casing of the just-fired round is extracted from the chamber, but is not ejected from the firearm, causing the next round to fail to feed, or the slide/bolt to fail to return to battery.  A stovepipe is common type of FTE.

=== Stovepipe ===
[[File:Failure to eject (FTE), firearm.jpg|thumb| Failure to eject (FTE, "stovepipe") in a semi-automatic pistol.]]
A stovepipe or smokestack typically occurs in [[pump action]], [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]], and [[automatic firearm|fully automatic]] firearms that fire from a closed bolt, when an empty cartridge case gets caught partway out of the ejection port instead of being thrown clear. Stovepipes can be caused by a malfunctioning or defective extractor or ejector, or when the shooter does not hold the firearm firmly enough for the action to function fully, known as [[limp wristing]], or due to reloads that are not sufficiently powerful to fully cycle the action, etc.

=== Double feed (Type 3 Malfunction) ===
A double feed occurs when an expended round is in the chamber AND the slide picks up a second round from the magazine mashing it into the first.  This can be caused by a broken extractor or a broken casing left behind in the chamber, and to be cleared could require simple tools.

=== Out-of-battery ===
{{main|Out-of-battery}}A firearm is "in-battery" when the slide/bolt is in the normal firing position.  A firearm is "out-of-battery" when the slide/bolt/action is not fully seated in the normal firing position, typically because it did not cycle fully after firing (called "returning to battery").  Most modern firearms are designed to not be capable of firing when significantly out-of-battery.  As such, a firearm that is out-of-battery typically cannot be fired, which is why this is a type of firearm malfunction.

A dangerous situation can occur when a chambered round fires when the firearm is out-of-battery (called an out-of-battery discharge).  The cartridge casing is not sufficiently strong to contain the pressure of firing by itself; it relies on the walls of the chamber and the bolt face to help contain the pressure.  When the firearm is out-of-battery, the round is not fully chambered, or the bolt face is not against the rear of the cartridge, and if the round is fired in this situation, the case will fail, causing high-pressure hot gasses, bits of burning powder, and fragments of the casing itself to be thrown at high-speed from the firearm.  This can be a serious hazard to the operator of the firearm, and any bystanders.

== Prevention ==
Some mechanical malfunctions are caused by poor design and cannot easily be avoided. Some malfunctions with cartridges can be attributed to poor quality or damaged ammunition (often due to improper storage, exposure to moisture). Many malfunctions, however, can be prevented by proper cleaning and maintenance of the firearm.

'''Gray baby syndrome''' (also termed '''Gray''' or '''Grey syndrome''') is a rare but serious side effect that occurs in newborn infants (especially premature babies) following the accumulation of antibiotic [[chloramphenicol]].&lt;ref name=McIntyre_2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McIntyre J, Choonara I | title = Drug toxicity in the neonate. | journal = Biol Neonate | volume = 86 | issue = 4 | pages = 218–21 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15249753 | doi = 10.1159/000079656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Toxic levels of [[chloramphenicol]] after 2–9 days result in:
*Loss of appetite
* Vomiting
* Ashen gray color of the skin
* [[Hypotension]] (low blood pressure)
* [[Cyanosis]] (blue discolouration of lips and skin)
* [[Hypothermia]]
* [[Cardiogenic shock|Cardiovascular collapse]]
* Hypotonia
*Abdominal distension
*Irregular respiration
*Increased blood lactate

==Pathophysiology==
Two pathophysiologic mechanisms are thought to play a role in the development of gray baby syndrome after  exposure to the anti-microbial drug chloramphenicol.  This condition is due to a lack of glucuronidation reactions occurring in the baby, thus leading to an accumulation of toxic chloramphenicol metabolites:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Laurence L. |editor1-last=Brunton |editor2-first=John S. |editor2-last=Lazo |editor3-first=Keith |editor3-last=Parker |title=[[Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]] |edition=11th | publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York | year=2005 | isbn=0-07-142280-3 |chapter= Chapter 46. Protein Synthesis Inhibitors and Miscellaneous Antibacterial Agents}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[UDP-glucuronyl transferase]] enzyme system of infants, especially premature infants, is immature and incapable of metabolizing the excessive drug load.
# Insufficient renal excretion of the unconjugated drug.
Due to these two reasons the chloramphenicol level in blood is increased, at higher concentration chloramphenicol blocks electron transport in the liver, myocardium, and skeletal muscles, resulting the above symptoms.
==Diagnosis==by observing the symptoms
{{Empty section|date=March 2018}}

==Prevention==
The condition can be prevented by using chloramphenicol at the recommended doses and monitoring blood levels,&lt;!--

==Treatment==
[[Chloramphenicol]] therapy should be stopped immediately. [[Exchange transfusion]] may be required to remove the drug. Sometimes, phenobarbital (UGT induction) is used.

A small-scale survey of homeopathic practitioners of New Zealand in 2008 showed that they all claimed to be able to treat [[asthma]] and [[ear infections]], and statements such as "hundreds of remedies for ear infections and asthma" and "homeopaths have a success rate nearing 80%" were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holt |first=Shaun |date=3 October 2008 |title=The responses of alternative practitioners when approached about common childhood illnesses |journal=[[The New Zealand Medical Journal]] |publisher=New Zealand Medical Association |volume=121 |issue=1283 |issn=1175-8716 |url=http://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal/121-1283/3282/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714042343/http://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal/121-1283/3282/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief and scepticism==

The [[New Zealand Skeptics]] organisation took part in the international [[10:23|10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;]] campaign in 2011. Protests were held in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

A 2012 survey showed that 51% of the New Zealand population had some degree of belief that homeopathic remedies were scientifically proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kiwis big believers in homeopathy|last=Anderson|first=Charles|date=22 January 2012 |work=Sunday Star Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisations==
The Auckland Homeopathic Hospital, with Carl Fisher as superintendent, operated from 1858 to 1862. For a half-yearly report of 1859 a total of 34 patients out of 55 were claimed to have been cured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 2| title = Page 2 Advertisements Column 6| work = Daily Southern Cross| accessdate = 2012-01-21| date = 1 February 1859| url = http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=DSC18590201.2.3.6&amp;cl=CL2.1859.02.01&amp;e=-------10--1----0Daily+Southern+Cross%2c+1+February+1859%2c+p%2e+2--&amp;zto=1

There are a number of training providers that teach homeopathy, and the [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority]] issues credits for homeopathy courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Qualifications - Search Results| accessdate = 2012-01-21| url = http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nzqf/search/results.do?q=homeopathy&amp;area=&amp;searchSubject=All&amp;type=&amp;lvl=&amp;credit=&amp;status=Current}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Zealand Council of Homeopaths, formed in 1999, acts as an representative for the industry. It was formed by the amalgamation of New Zealand Homoeopathic Society, the New Zealand Institute of Classical Homeopathy and the New Zealand Accreditation Board of Natural Therapies.

==Prosecutions==
The [[Commerce Commission]], which administers the [[Fair Trading Act 1986|Fair Trading Act]], has prosecuted companies for misleading claims about homeopathic products.

In 1997 SCI Natural (NZ) Ltd was to be prosecuted for claims that the Soft Seaweed Soap product would help people to lose weight. The Commerce Commission decided not to go ahead with the prosecution since a key individual had left New Zealand and the company went into liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=False claims that seaweed soap causes weight loss|publisher=Commerce Commission|date=17 August 1997|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/media-releases/detail/1997/falseclaimsthatseaw/|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Tauranga-based couple who specialised in homoeopathic remedies pleaded guilty to 19 charges under the Fair Trading Act in 2008 for making misleading claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Bird flu remedy is quackery|publisher=Commerce Commission|date=15 January 2008|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/media-releases/detail/2008/birdfluremedyisquackery/|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hoshizuka Keiaien Sanatorium''', ('''National Sanatorium Hoshizuka Keiaien''') is a sanatorium for [[leprosy]] patients or ex-leprosy patients in [[Kanoya]]-shi, [[kagoshima]]-ken, [[Japan]] which was established in 1935.
==History==
===Background===
Following the establishment of prefectural sanatoriums, the Japanese government decided to increase sanatoriums, first with National Sanatorium Nagashoma Airakuen in 1930. Hoshizuka Keiaien was the 4th sanatorium which was established in 1935. Unlike other areas, resistance to the establishment of this sanatorium was small.

===Hoshizuka Keiaien===
*Oct 28, 1935: The opening ceremony was held. The first director was Fumio Hayashi.
*Feb 1944: The 2nd director was Einosuke Shionuma.
*Mar 18, Jun 8, Aug 12, 1945: Air raids with 6 patients killed.
*Apr 1996: The 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law was abolished.
*Jul 1998: The trial for compensation started.
*May 11, 2001: The trial for compensation ruled that the previous Leprosy Prevention was unconstitutional.
*May 25, 2001: The trial for compensation was confirmed. The compensation of 8,000,000 yen to 14,000,000 yen was given to patients depending on the duration of unconstitutional periods.

===Number of Patients on March 31 next year===
The number of in-patients is the sum of patients which changed not only by the newly diagnosed hospitalized and those who died among in-patients, by other factors such as the number of patients who escaped or were discharged, depending on the condition of the times. Recently they were encouraged to be discharged, but the long period of the segregation policy causing leprosy stigma might influence the number of those who went into the society.

==Promin worked==
It was at the congress of the Japanese Leprosy Association held in the Keiaien Sanatorium on November 2 and 3, 1947 that the effects of [[promin]] were first reported. At first it did not attract attention since cepharanthin, a new drug for leprosy which had been tested earlier proved disappointing. Promin use started in November 1948, and the effects of promin were amazing. "Give us promin" movement began. The first patient cleared with promin was discharged in April, 1953. 
*"Rai-iete, En-wo Sariyuru Wakamono o Gaku-narashitsutu Warera Miokuru."
**(A young man is leaving our sanatorium, cleared of leprosy, we see him go off, with delightfully played march) This was one of the tanka poems recited before the Emperor and Empress of Japan next January. 

==Scabies==
Leprosy in earlier days has been associated with scabies, and this has been pointed out by [[Kensuke Mitsuda]]. There were many cases of scabies.&lt;ref&gt;Namonaki Hoshi Tachiyo(1985) p.266&lt;/ref&gt;
*1935: 83cases
*1937: 195 cases
*1938: 3146 cases
*1939: 5298 cases
*1940: 7950 cases
*1945: too many
*1946: 12017
*1952: No record

==Vasectomy==
*Vasectomy was started by [[Kensuke Mitsuda]] in 1915. Leprosy usually worsens in women during pregnancy and delivery. Married patients usually could not bring up babies, and children born of leprosy patients could be stigmatized in the future. However, the real reason was to exterminate leprosy patients.  There were 334 cases of vasectomy between 1936 and 1971 in the Keiaien Sanatorium.
*There were 45 cases of interrupted pregnancy between 1950 and 1959.

==History==
[[File:IAMMS.jpg|thumb|right|250x80px|Mosaic of Iranian tiles calligraphically inscribed ‘Ibn Sina Academy ...’ (now destroyed during renovation; once installed at the main entrance)]]
[[File:IAMMS2.jpg|thumb|right|250x80px|Foundation stone at the entrance gate of academy]]

Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences is an extension of '''Majlis Ibn Sina''', which was formed in 1965 under the aegis of '''Tibbi Academy'''. Majlis Ibn Sina was a sort of monthly discussion group. For instance, the first meeting of that Majlis was held to discuss [[typhoid]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hikmat, Issue of July 1965, Ed. Syed Zillur Rahman Nadvi, Tibbi Academy, Delhi,&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tibbi Academy''' was itself formed in 1963 at [[Bhopal]]. In a note on page&amp;nbsp;4, of the first book of Tibbi Academy, on ''Modern Times and Unani Medicine'' the author [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]] announced the establishment of Tibbi Academy with its clear objective: "to publicise the theoretical principles and practical ideas of [[Unani medicine]], to publish the text of standard works of Unani medicine and also their translations… further, a learned and research oriented monthly journal".

From 1965 to 1970, a monthly journal with the title ''Al-Hikmat'' (in [[Urdu language|Urdu]]) from [[Delhi]] was published under the auspices of Tibbi Academy under the editorship of Syed Zillur Rahman Nadvi. The editor stated in the introduction of the first issue (May 1965, page&amp;nbsp;2) that the journal is being issued.

Further, besides the above-mentioned objectives, the editor listed a couple of additional objectives, e.g., "the search of manuscripts of the [[Unani medicine]], their edition and publication, … to excite the feeling of the pressing need of Unani medicine literature, and to publish a standard book every year". He lamented that despite the publication of 30-40 Tibbi magazines in India, no learned journal of Unani medicine is being published. He stressed that ''Al-Hikmat'' would be a purely scholarly journal not confined to Unani medicine: It would include some articles on basic sciences, that is, [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]] and [[philosophy]].

In 1970, Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman renamed the Tibbi Academy as '''Shifaul Mulk Memorial Committee''' after his teacher, Shifaul Mulk Hakim Abdul Latif (29 April 1900 – 14 November 1970), former professor and principal of Ajmal Khan Tibbiya College, [[Aligarh Muslim University]]. The purpose of this memorial committee was the same as Tibbi Academy formed in 1963, except the widened scope of publications.

All these past establishments — '''Tibbi Academy''' (1963), '''Majlis Ibn Sina''' (1965) and '''Shifaul Mulk Memorial Committee''' (1970) — merged and came under one trustee organisation, i.e., '''Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences''' in 2000. It was formally inaugurated on 21 April 2001.

The Memorial Committee and Tibbi Academy are now a part of the Publication Division of Ibn Sina Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibnsinaacademy.org/publication.html Publication Division of Ibn Sina Academy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AIDS Cell ===
AIDS Cell of IAMMS was established in the year 2002 with Dr Imran Sabri as the founder Incharge of this prestigious institute. The Main AIM of the AIDS Cell is to spread awareness about AIDS in common population and newly graduated doctors.
AIDS Cell of the academy is dedicated to improving lives, knowledge, and understanding worldwide through a highly diversified programme of research, education, and services in [[HIV/AIDS]] screening and prevention, care and treatment, [[reproductive health]] and [[infectious diseases]]. AIDS Cell is a partner member of [[Global Health Council]] (USA) and the AIDS-Care-Watch Campaign (Thailand).
It has a separate library of documents relevant to [[HIV/AIDS]] project management, research, and [[reproductive health]] issues apart from CD-ROMs, [[poster]] and [[books]] in several languages.
AIDS Cell of IAMMS claims responsibility of holding Symposium on Medico-Social implication of the emerging epidemic of HIV/AIDS on India, Free Health check-up and Drug Distribution camp.

=== Ibn Sina Shifa Khana ===
For [[clinical studies]] of indigenous drugs, IAMMS is engaged in research and development in its clinical set-up, Ibn Sina Shifakhana, at Okhla Vihar, [[New Delhi]].

=== Centre for Safety and Rational Use of Indian Systems of Medicine ===
The academy took a novel task of improving the use of Indian originated drugs and their adverse reaction monitoring under the establishment of Centre for Safety &amp; Rational Use of Indian Systems of Medicine (CSRUISM) in 2005. CSRUISM receives many [[adverse drug reactions]] of [[herbs]], which were never reported earlier. These reactions for their causal relationships are assessed according to [[Naranjo algorithm]] and [[WHO]] causality categories. The Centre has organised many CMEs on Pharmacovigilance in association with [[Society of Pharmacovigilance, India]]

=== Ghalib Study Centre ===
This centre was set up to study Urdu poetry particularly of [[Mirza Ghalib]]. The centre has a largest collection on 'Ghalibiat' (things related to poet Ghalib). It has several books and periodicals especially ‘Ghalib Numbers’ issued particularly as a part of his birth centenary observed all over the world in 1969. In addition, there are hundreds of other poets’ collection, memoirs and writings. The Centre is famous for organising [[Mushaira]] and till now has published two books on [[Mirza Ghalib]].

'''''Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique''''' is a famous popular scientific treatise and self-help book published in London in 1926 by Dutch [[gynecology|gynecologist]] [[Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde]], retired director of the Gynecological Clinic in [[Haarlem]], and "one of the major writers on human sexuality during the early twentieth century" (Frayser &amp; Whitby, p.&amp;nbsp;300).  It was the best-known work on its subject for several decades, and was reprinted 46 times in the original edition.  After World-War Two, it sold over a half-million copies. A revised edition was published in 1965. and a subsequent one in 2000 (Melody &amp; Pearson, p.&amp;nbsp;96).

It proclaimed the "critical goal of marriage consists of sexual pleasure shared by husband and wife" (Melody and Person, p.&amp;nbsp;93). A 2000 edition of the book described itself as concentrating "on the cultivation of the technique of eroticism as an art in marriage."

Frederica Mathewes-Green, in the ''National Review'', described it as

{{quote |the best-selling sex manual of all time. Over half a million copies were sold in the United States alone, and it enjoyed equal success in Europe.  ...This is not a prude's book.  Young couples who grab a used copy off the Internet may have even as much fun with it as their great-grandparents did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = National Review | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/mathewes-green/mathewesgreen200411220815.asp | date = 2004-11-22 | first = Frederica | last = Mathewes-Green}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first printing had an insert: "The sale of this book is strictly limited to members of the medical profession, Psychoanalysts, Scholars, and to such adults as may have a definite position in the field of Physiological, Psychological, or Social Research."  It was placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] in 1931.

&lt;!--Please See naming conventions at WP:MOSBIO, do not add details like "Dr." or "PhD"--&gt;'''John William Gofman''' (September 21, 1918 – August 15, 2007) was an American scientist and advocate. He was Professor Emeritus of Molecular and Cell Biology at [[University of California at Berkeley]].

Gofman pioneered the field of clinical [[lipidology]], and was honoured with the title of "Father of Clinical Lipidology" by the Journal of Clinical Lipidology in 2007.&lt;ref name="Brown-Journal of Clinical Lipidology 2007" /&gt; With [[Frank T. Lindgren]] and other research associates, Gofman discovered and described three major classes of [[plasma lipoproteins]], fat molecules that carry cholesterol in the blood. The team he led at the Donner Laboratory went on to demonstrate the role of lipoproteins in the causation of [[heart disease]].
&lt;!--
In his radio interview for Lipid Luminations : https://reachmd.com/programs/lipid-luminations/who-was-john-gofman/2029/, W Virgil Brown, editor-in-chief of the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, says that Gofman "is one of my heroes" and that is work was "extremely important and led the groundwork" for the future of lipidology (? I didn't get one word, but think it is either lipidology or lipoprotein) "even today".
--&gt;

Gofman was instrumental in inducing the health physics scientific community both to acknowledge the cancer risks of ionizing radiation and to adopt the [[Linear no-threshold model|Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model]] as a means of estimating actual cancer risks from low-level radiation and as the foundation of the international guidelines for radiation protection.

Gofman's earliest research was in nuclear physics and chemistry, in close connection to the [[Manhattan Project]]. He co-discovered several [[radioisotope]]s, notably [[uranium-233]] and its fissionability ; he was the third person ever to work with [[plutonium]], and, having devised an early process for separating plutonium from fission products at [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]’s request,&lt;ref name="Gofman UC-California Obituary" /&gt; he was the first chemist ever to try and isolate milligram quantities of plutonium.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Witnesses p 85" /&gt;

In 1963, Gofman established the Biomedical Research Division for the [[Livermore National Laboratory]], where he was on the cutting edge of research into the connection between [[chromosomal abnormalities]] and cancer.

Later in life, Gofman took on a role as an advocate warning of [[Anti-nuclear movement#Concerns about nuclear power|dangers involved with nuclear power]]. From 1971 onward, he was the Chairman of the [[Committee for Nuclear Responsibility]]. He was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]] for his work on the effects of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]'s low-level radiation exposure on the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratical.org/radiation/CNR/CNR.html Mission Statement of the Committee for Nuclear Responsibility]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear research==
John Gofman graduated from [[Oberlin College]] with a bachelor's in chemistry in 1939, and received a doctorate in nuclear and physical chemistry from [[University of California at Berkeley|Berkeley]] in 1943, where he worked as a graduate student under [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], the discoverer of plutonium and later a chairman of the [[US Atomic Energy Commission]]. In his PhD dissertation, Gofman described the discovery of radioisotopes [[protactinium]]-232, [[uranium-232]], protactinium-233, as well as [[uranium-233]] and the characterization of its fissionability.&lt;ref name="Gofman PhD Dissertation" /&gt; Seaborg had a very high opinion of Gofman : he called Gofman one of his "most brilliant students" when, in 1963, he appointed him to head the Biomedical Research Division at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory;&lt;ref&gt;J. Samuel Walker, Permissible Dose, p 38-39, 2000, University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-22328-4}}]]&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote that his PhD dissertation was "very brilliant".&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Seaborg and Benjamin Loeb, The Atomic Energy Commission under Nixon: Adjusting to Troubled Times, New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1993, p.123, cited in : Ioanna Semendeferi, "Exploiting Uncertainty in Radiation Limits: Monticello Dissenters, Health Physicists, and the Civilian Nuclear-Power Debate", University of Minnesota, 2003, p.84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gofman shared three patents with collaborators on their discoveries :
* n° 3,123,535 (Glenn T. Seaborg, John W. Gofman, Raymond W. Stoughton): The slow and fast neutron fissionability of uranium-233, with its application to production of nuclear power or nuclear weapons.
* n° 2,671,251 (John W. Gofman, Robert E. Connick, Arthur C. Wahl): The sodium uranyl acetate process for the separation of plutonium in irradiated fuel from uranium and fission products.
* n° 2,912,302 (Robert E. Connick, John W. Gofman, George C. Pimentel): The columbium oxide process for the separation of plutonium in irradiated fuel from uranium and fission products.&lt;ref name="Gofman CV 1996" /&gt;

Gofman later became the group co-leader of the Plutonium Project, an offshoot of the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref name="Gofman NYT Obituary"/&gt;

==Medical research==
{{expand section|date=July 2015}}

Dr. Gofman earned his medical degree from the [[University of California, San Francisco]], in 1946. After that, he and his collaborators investigated the body’s [[lipoprotein]]s, which contain both [[protein]]s and [[fat]]s, and their circulation within the bloodstream. The researchers described low-density and high-density lipoproteins and their roles in metabolic disorders and coronary disease. This work continued throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s.&lt;ref name="Gofman NYT Obituary" /&gt;

==At Livermore : taking on the US Atomic Energy Commission==

===Establishment of LLNL's Medical Department===
At the request of [[Ernest Lawrence]], Gofman established the Medical Department at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) in early 1954 and acted as the Medical Director until 1957 roughly two days a week while teaching at Berkeley the rest of the time.&lt;ref name="Gofman DOE Oral History" /&gt;

===Establishment of LLNL's Biomedical Research Division===

====AEC's response to public outcry====
In 1962, the US had resumed atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons at the Nevada test site in 1962. The State of Utah had set up its own network of monitoring facilities to test milk for radioiodine, since "data pertaining to the safety of the citizens of Utah was not forthcoming from the AEC",&lt;ref&gt;Scott Kirsch, "Harold Knapp and the Geography of Normal Controversy: Radioiodine in the Historical Environment", Osiris, 2nd Series, Vol. 19, Landscapes of Exposure: Knowledge and Illness in Modern Environments (2004), pp. 167-181&lt;/ref&gt; and the levels of radioactivity were found to be close to the limits prescribed by the Federal Radiation Council. The Commissioners of the AEC were "on the hot seat" and announced "a comprehensive, long-range program" to explore the effects of man-made radioactivity "upon plants, animals and human beings".&lt;ref&gt;John Gofman and Arthur Tamplin, "Population control through nuclear pollution", 1970, Nelson Hall co., p.54-56&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of the [[US Atomic Energy Commission]] and of LLNL's director [[John S. Foster, Jr|John Foster]], Gofman reluctantly accepted to establish the Biomedical Research Division for the LLNL in 1963. He served as the first director of the LLNL biomedical research division from 1963 to 1965 and as one of the nine associate directors of the entire lab until 1969.&lt;ref name="Semendeferi Paper"/&gt;

====Immediate moves to hinder the Biomedical Research program====
The AEC had acted too fast in response to public outcry : one of the five Commissioners, James T. Ramey, had not been consulted before announcing the establishment of the Biomedical Research Division. Gofman reported that "Apparently it would have been too embarrassing, with the extensive AEC publicity about the program, to cancel it outright. Instead, the budget was cut even from the low starting value and we were given to understand, in no uncertain terms, that the program was not going to be supported at the level required to do the tasks outlined originally." However, Gofman and colleagues "accepted the reduced program, knowing that [they] could certainly still do much of the important work on radiation hazards."

After the atmospheric test ban treaty was signed in June 1963 and the public pressure on AEC was released, "[t]he Joint Committee on Atomic Energy struck from the AEC budget the funds that were to be used to construct a Bio-Medical complex at Livermore. This was tantamount to the JCAE stating that the Livermore Bio-Medical Program was unnecessary, for without facilities to work in it was hard to envision much of a program being possible." LLNL's director John Foster and Gofman had to struggle to obtain the initially promised funds.
&lt;ref&gt;John Gofman and Arthur Tamplin, "Population control through nuclear pollution", 1970, Nelson Hall co., p.65-68&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Knapp report on radioiodine from fallout in milk===

In 1959, the geneticist [[Edward B. Lewis]] computed that children exposed to fallout from nuclear tests may have received very high doses of radioactivity from iodine-131 in cow milk. His estimates prompted the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy to request that the AEC produce a report on the risks of short-lived isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;Emory J. Jessee, PhD thesis, "Radiation Ecologies: Bombs, Bodies, and Environment during the Atmospheric Nuclear Weapons Testing Period, 1942-1965", p258-265, January 2013, Montana State University.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, [[Harold A. Knapp]], a mathematician working within the AEC Division of Biology and Medicine's Fallout Studies Branch, authored this report,&lt;ref&gt;Harold A. Knapp, June 6, 1960, "The Contribution of Short Lived Isotopes and Hot Spots to Radiation Exposure in the United States from Nuclear Test Fallout", NTA, NV00019168.&lt;/ref&gt; but since it was finished during an international moratorium on atmospheric nuclear tests, it had no notable impact. Then, in 1962, while the USSR and the USA had resumed nuclear tests and the Limited Test Ban Treaty was being prepared in response to huge international pressure, Knapp took on the task of estimating the radioiodine exposure of Americans before 1958, at a time when milk was not monitored. Knapp conclusions were alarming, and blatantly departed from preceding AEC's reassurances that the public had never been exposed to harmful levels of radioactivity. He "showed that, from just one 1953 test, infants who had been living in a radiation hotspot around St. George, Utah, might well have received I-131 doses anywhere from 150 to 750 times existing annual permissible doses." &lt;ref&gt;Scott Kirsch, "Harold Knapp and the Geography of Normal Controversy: Radioiodine in the Historical Environment", Osiris, 2nd Series, Vol. 19, Landscapes of Exposure: Knowledge and Illness in ModernEnvironments (2004), pp. 167-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in fall 1962, the AEC resorted to diverse pretexts to block the publication of Knapp's findings. In spring 1963, Gofman, was solicited to participate in a so-called "Ad Hoc Working Group on Radioiodine and the Environment" assembled by AEC's Division of Operational Safety's director, Gordon Dunning. Gofman reported that "In essence, the message to [this] Committee […] was « How can we stop this report - a report which will, in effect, make the AEC reports over the past 10 years look untrue? »".&lt;ref&gt;John Gofman and Arthur Tamplin, "Population control through nuclear pollution", 1970, Nelson Hall co., p.64-65&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of AEC's Headquarters' objections, the committee recommended publication of Knapp's report, which was finally published by the AEC in June 1963,&lt;ref&gt;Harold Knapp, "Iodine-131 in Fresh Milk and Human Thyroids Following a Single Deposition of Nuclear Test Fallout," TLD-19266, Health and Safety, TID-4500, 24th ed. (Washington, D.C., 1 June 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a summary in ''Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Knapp, "Iodine- 131 in Fresh Milk and Human Thyroids follow- ing a Single Deposition of Nuclear Test Fall-Out, " Nature, 9 May 1964, 534-7,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gofman and Tamplin===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

In 1964, Gofman raised questions about a lack of data on low-level radiation and also proposed a wide-ranging study of exposure in medicine and the workplace at a symposium for nuclear scientists and engineers. This helped start a national inquiry into the safety of atomic power. With his colleague Dr. [[Arthur R. Tamplin]], Dr. Gofman then looked at health studies of the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as other epidemiological studies, and conducted research on radiation’s influences on human chromosomes. The two scientists suggested that federal safety guidelines for low-level exposures be reduced by 90 percent in 1969. The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] contested the findings, and "the furor made Dr. Gofman a reluctant figurehead of the [[Anti-nuclear movement in the United States|anti-nuclear movement]]" according to ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name="Gofman NYT Obituary" /&gt;  In 1970, he testified in favor of a bill to ban commercial nuclear reactors in New York City and told the City Council that a reactor in an urban environment would be "equal in the opposite direction to all the medical advances put together in the last 25 years."&lt;ref name="Gofman NYT Obituary" /&gt;

==Gofman's major contribution to radiation-safety science==

Gofman and Tamplin were instrumental in inducing the health physics scientific community both to acknowledge the somatic (i.e. leukemia and cancer) risks of ionizing radiation, at a time when only the genetic risks were considered of significant concern, and to adopt the so-called [[Linear no-threshold model|Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model]] "as a means of numerically estimating actual cancer risks from low-level radiation", which "was a watershed event in radiation-safety science and politics".&lt;ref name="Ioanna Semendeferi p.300"&gt;Ioanna Semendeferi, "Legitimating a Nuclear Critic: John Gofman, Radiation Safety, and Cancer Risks", Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences, Vol. 38, Number 2, p.300. {{DOI|10.1525/hsns.2008.38.2.259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LNT model has since become the foundation of the international guidelines for radiation protection.

Indeed, it was Gofman and Tamplin's argumented opposition to the Federal Radiation Council (FRC) radiation-safety guidelines who prompted the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), on the recommendation made in December 1969 by Victor Bond, "a prominent health physicist and chairman of the NAS-NRC Subcommittee on Radiobiology of the Committee on Nuclear Science",&lt;ref&gt;Ioanna Semendeferi, "Legitimating a Nuclear Critic: John Gofman, Radiation Safety, and Cancer Risks", Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences, Vol. 38, Number 2, p.293. {{DOI|10.1525/hsns.2008.38.2.259}}&lt;/ref&gt; to gather its first BEIR (Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation) committee. According to an internal memo cited by Semendeferi, the BEIR I committee was to "thoroughly digest and carefully analyze various pertinent controversial models (Gofman and Tamplin)".&lt;ref&gt;Ioanna Semendeferi, "Legitimating a Nuclear Critic: John Gofman, Radiation Safety, and Cancer Risks", Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences, Vol. 38, Number 2, p.294. {{DOI|10.1525/hsns.2008.38.2.259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years of study, the BEIR I committee published its famous BEIR I report in November 1972. Although departing from Gofman and Tamplin's work on significant aspects, it nevertheless vindicated their arguments to a large extent. Semendeferi notes that "[t]he report's long bibliography cited almost all of Gofman and Tamplin's work. Echoing Gofman and Tamplin, the BEIR I Committee emphasized that the cancer effects of low-level radiation were of much greater concern than leukemia or genetic effects. The current radiation limit was "based on genetic considerations," and the committee concluded that the FRC limit was therefore "unnecessarily high" and could safely be much lower."&lt;ref&gt;Ioanna Semendeferi, "Legitimating a Nuclear Critic: John Gofman, Radiation Safety, and Cancer Risks", Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences, Vol. 38, Number 2, p.296. {{DOI|10.1525/hsns.2008.38.2.259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semendeferi reports that, according to the radiobiologist and environmental health specialist Edward Radford, who was a member of the BEIR I committee and the chairman of the BEIR III committee, "Gofman deserved credit for raising the issue of the somatic ris's of low-level radiation as early as he did", but "never received the recognition he deserved for his contributions to radiation-safety science" because he was "stigmatized as an extreme antinuclear scientist".&lt;ref name="Ioanna Semendeferi p.300"/&gt;

Excerpts from an obituary tribute by Dr. Kathleen Burns on the Energy Justice website at http://mail.energyjustice.net/pipermail/nukenet_energyjustice.net/2007-August/002217.html){{Cleanup-section|date=August 2007}}

John Gofman was one of the first scientists who offered a clear path to documenting the long-term harm done by radiation using cancer epidemiology. His approach to taking current real-world data on what was happening in communities of radiation-exposed people and projecting likely cancers in the future was a major leap forward. It made it possible to understand that the likely consequences of low level radiation were much greater than previously described. He understood that cancer develops in different people at different ages, and so constructed tables to "predict" the long-term consequences of exposing large populations to radiation. His 1981 book ''Radiation and Human Health'', described this and many other things that are still very relevant to our struggles for public health protection today.

For those people who also work on chemical hazards and protection of children's health, his 1981 book was one of the first that contained a concept we are finding to be extremely important in chemicals management for public health protection. His study of radiation-induced cancer showed that low dose exposures could do greater damage per unit of dose than high dose exposures (a supralinear dynamic illustrated in "Radiation and Human Health" by Gofman, as listed below)).{{Fact|date=August 2007}}  At a time when accepted truths about radiation were derived from high dose Hiroshima and Nagasaki effects, this was a leap forward in thinking about radiation and understanding the hazards of low doses of ionizing radiation. It has only been in the last 5 years that studies have been published on this same dynamic for some chemical hazards, for example lead and mercury induced cognitive damage in children (Axelrad et al., 2007 at www.ehponline.org/members/2007/9303/9303.pdf Free full text online). The implications for national public health policies are substantial - for at least some chemicals, our water, food, air, and soil standards that rely on old ways of thinking may not be sufficient.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

==Opposition to nuclear power ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

Gofman retired as a teaching professor in 1973 and became a professor emeritus of molecular and cell biology.

Gofman testified on the behalf of [[Samuel Lovejoy]] at Lovejoy's 1974 trial. Lovejoy was charged with malicious destruction of property for toppling a weather tower in [[Montague, Massachusetts]], owned by [[Northeast Utilities]]. Lovejoy's actions were an act of protest against a proposed nuclear power plant, [[Montague Nuclear Power Plant]], to be built on Montague Plains. Lovejoy was inspired by Gofman's book, ''Poisoned Power''.

Gofman used his low-level radiation health model to predict 333 excess cancer or leukemia deaths from the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gofman John W.|first=Tamplin, Arthur R.|title=Poisoned power: the case against nuclear power plants before and after Three Mile Island|date=December 1, 1979|publisher=Rodale Press|location=Emmaus, PA|page=xvii|url=http://www.ratical.org/radiation/CNR/PP/Foreward1979.html|edition=Poisoned Power (1971) updated|accessdate=1 October 2013|quote=(In 1979 Foreword:) "...we arrive at 333 fatal cancers or leukemias."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of the [[Three Mile Island accident health effects|health effects of the Three Mile Island accident]] have so far (by 2013) not observed any excess mortality. A retrospective study of Pennsylvania Cancer Registry found an increased incidence of thyroid cancer in counties south of TMI and in high-risk age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Levin RJ, De Simone NF, Slotkin JF, Henson BL |title=Incidence of thyroid cancer surrounding Three Mile Island nuclear facility: the 30-year follow-up.|work=Laryngoscope.|pages=123(8):2064–71|date= August 2013|pmid=23371046}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Talbott lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported finding only a few, small, mostly statistically non-significant, increased cancer risks within the TMI population. However, excess leukemia among males was observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Han YY, Youk AO, Sasser H, Talbott EO |title=Cancer incidence among residents of the Three Mile Island accident area: 1982-1995|work=Environ Res|location=111(8)|pages=1230–5|date=November 2011|pmid=21855866}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing TMI epidemiological research has been accompanied by a discussion of epidemiological methodology, such as problems in dose and illness classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Wing S, Richardson D, Armstrong D, Crawford-Brown D |title=A reevaluation of cancer incidence near the Three Mile Island nuclear plant: the collision of evidence and assumptions|work=Environ Health Perspect|location=105(1)|pages=52–7|date=January 1997|pmid=9074881}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Wing S, Richardson DB, Hoffmann W |title=Cancer risks near nuclear facilities: the importance of research design and explicit study hypotheses|work=Environ Health Perspect|location=119(4)|pages=417–21|date=April 2011|pmid=21147606}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months after the [[Chernobyl disaster]], Gofman predicted that Chernobyl would cause "475,000 fatal cancers plus about 
an equal number of additional non-fatal cases, occurring over time both inside and outside the ex-Soviet Union".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gofman|first=John W.|title=Radiation-Induced Cancer from Low-Dose Exposure:   An Independent Analysis|publisher=Committee for Nuclear Responsibility|location=San Francisco|url=http://www.ratical.org/radiation/CNR/RIC/|editor=Egan O'Connor|accessdate=2 October 2013|chapter=Assessing Chernobyl's Cancer Consequences: Application of Four `Laws' of Radiation Carcinogenesis. Paper presented at the Symposium on Low-Level Radiation, National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, September 9, 1986. Reprinted as Chapter 37|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, even some 19 years later in September 2005, an official UN [[IAEA]] report claimed 4,000 deaths as the final estimated toll from Chernobyl.&lt;ref name=sister&gt;{{cite web|last=Bertell |first=Rosalie |title=Behind the Cover-Up: Assessing conservatively the full Chernobyl death toll |url=http://www.pacificecologist.org/archive/12/behind-the-cover-up.pdf |work=Pacific Ecologist |accessdate=2 October 2013 |date=Winter 2006 |quote=Ref.2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004223521/http://www.pacificecologist.org/archive/12/behind-the-cover-up.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In their 2006 book Alexey V. Yablokov and other Russian and East European researchers estimated that Chernobyl caused a million deaths through 2004, nearly 170,000 of them in North America.  The book's English translation [[Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment]] was published by the New York Academy of Sciences in 2009. The book cites "5,000 mainly Slavic-language scientific papers the IAEA overlooked", notwithstanding the fact that 13 of the authors of the [[Chernobyl Forum]] were from Ukraine, Russia or Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/WHO%20Report%20on%20Chernobyl%20Health%20Effects%20July%2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyas.org"&gt;[http://www.nyas.org/Publications/Annals/Detail.aspx?cid=f3f3bd16-51ba-4d7b-a086-753f44b3bfc1 Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment"]&lt;/ref&gt; M. I. Balonov criticized the methodology of the book.&lt;ref name="nyas.org"/&gt; M. I. Balonov criticized the methodology of the book's estimation of Chernobyl's excess deaths and radiation-induced health effects and claimed the numbers were exaggerations which "could lead quite unnecessarily to a panic reaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balonov|first=M.I.|title=On protecting the inexperienced reader from Chernobyl myths|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0952-4746/32/2/181/|journal=J Radiol Prot|volume=32 | issue = 8 |pages=181–9|doi=10.1088/0952-4746/32/2/181|date=June 2012|PMID= 22569279}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosalie Bertell]] has asserted the above estimates of Gofman (1986) and Yablokov (2006) are too conservative.&lt;ref name=sister/&gt;

After a speech Gofman gave on [[nuclear waste]] at a national conference of activists in the summer of 1990, Charles Butler approached him for help. Butler was a retired physicist living in the [[Mojave Desert]] town of [[Needles, California]], and was looking for help to stop the proposed low-level nuclear waste facility at [[Ward Valley (California)|Ward Valley]]. Gofman referred him to the [[Abalone Alliance]] Clearinghouse in San Francisco. With less than two weeks before the closure of the [[Environmental Impact Statement]], the Alliance was able to mount a letter writing campaign that helped delay the EIS for an additional 90 days. This initial delay gave activists the time to form Don't Waste California and build a grassroots campaign that eventually stopped Ward Valley from opening.

Gofman also did work on the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]].

==Support to nuclear deterrence==
Gofman considered that "nuclear deterrence is important", for he did not believe that comprehensive test bans were enforceable ; thus he favored underground atomic bomb tests while acknowledging that "They are harmful, a little will leak out. A small number of people will get hurt." He claimed "I don't understand the disarmament movement".&lt;ref name="Gofman DOE Oral History" /&gt; More precisely, he was of the opinion that if the US were to disarm unilaterally, "the Soviet leaders may well try to make [the US] a slave state. […] There will surely never be a solution to human problems by any coercion or force. But there will also never be a solution through unarmed freedom as long as powerful bullies exist who will ''use'' force."&lt;ref&gt;Pat Stone, [http://www.motherearthnews.com/nature-and-environment/john-gofman-anti-nuclear-zmaz81mazraw.aspx John Gofman: Nuclear and Anti-Nuclear Scientist], Mother Earth News, March–April 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and death==

Gofman was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] to [[Jewish]] parents, David and Sarah Gofman, who immigrated to the USA from czarist Russia in about 1905.&lt;ref name="Gofman RMP book 1999" /&gt; His father had been "involved in some of the early revolutionary activities against the Czar." &lt;ref&gt;Sally Smith Hughes, [https://archive.org/details/medicalresearchr00gofmrich Medical research and radiation politics: oral history transcript - John Gofman], Bancroft Library, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Gofman died of heart failure at age 88 on August 15, 2007 in his home in San Francisco.

'''John Macías, O.P.'''  (''Spanish'' '''San Juan Macias''' ''alt. sp'' '''Massias''') (2 March 1585 [[Ribera del Fresno]], [[Extremadura]], Spain – September 16, 1645, [[Lima]], [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]), was a [[Spain|Spanish]]-born [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Friar]] who evangelized in Peru in 1620. He was canonized in 1975 by [[Pope Paul VI]]. His main image is located at the main altar of the [[Historic Centre of Lima#Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary and Convent of Santo Domingo|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary of Lima]] and is venerated by the local laity in Peru.  A church was built in his honor in 1970 in San Luis, Lima, Peru.

==Biography==
He was born '''Juan de Arcas y Sánchez''' on  March 2, 1585 in the small town of [[Ribera del Fresno]], [[Extremadura]] which was under the jurisdiction of the [[Palencia]] Diocese, to Pedro de Arcas and Juana Sánchez. His parents were poor farmers; both died when Juan and his sister Mary were young. Juan was but four years old. The two children were raised by their uncle whose last name, “Macias,” they took as their own.&lt;ref name=nashville&gt;[http://nashvilledominican.org/Charism/Our_Dominican_Heritage/Our_Saints_and_Blesseds/St_Juan_Macias "St. John Macias", Dominican sisters of St. Cecilia]&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle trained him as a shepherd. Juan would pass the long hours saying the rosary.

When he was about 16 years old, Macias met a Dominican [[friar]] while attending Mass in a neighboring village, and he began to consider the possibility of becoming a Dominican. It is said that as he began to seek God’s will for his life; he was frequently visited by the Blessed Virgin Mary and by his patron, St. John the Evangelist.&lt;ref name=nashville/&gt;

At the age of 25, Macias then started working with a wealthy businessman who offered him an opportunity to travel to South America. He set out for the Americas in 1619,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dominicans.ca/Family/Figures/masias.htm "Blessed John Macias (1585-1645)", Dominicans of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;  arriving first at [[Cartagena de Indias]], [[Colombia]], then [[Reino de Nueva Granada]], before stopping by [[Pasto]] and then [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], and eventually arriving in Lima, [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Perú]] where he would remain for the rest of his life. Juan Macias was young when he set off as an emigrant for the new world. The ships which crossed the seas in those days carried all sorts of people: soldiers led by the lure of gold or glory; missionaries going to preach the Gospel; merchants and those seeking adventure; and also the poverty stricken hoping to find better luck.&lt;ref name=canada&gt;[http://www.dominicans.ca/Documents/masters/Couesnongle/macias.html Couesnongle, O.P., Vincent de, "The social message of John Macias", ''A plea for Itinerant Preaching Conference'', Rome 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Father Vincent de Couesnongle, O.P., "[h]e knew what it meant to be uprooted and torn away from his natural surroundings, from everything he was used to. He knew what it is like to plunge into the unknown. He experienced the normal mixture of hopes and fears, and the difficulty of putting down roots and adapting to new ways. He was one of those millions of people who down through the ages have been shuttled from one country to another, not for the fun of it, or for adventure's sake, but because they had to."&lt;ref name=canada/&gt;

On 23 January 1622, Macias entered the Dominican [[Priory]] of St. [[Mary Magdalene]] in Lima. He entered as a lay brother, a non-ordained friar who, instead of preaching, would do the manual labor necessary in the monastery. One year later on 25 January 1623 he took his final vows. Macias was a contemporary of St. [[Martin de Porres]] who was in the Priory of Santo Domingo, (otherwise known as Holy Rosary). Juan was the assistant porter (doorkeeper) at St. Mary Magdalene and lived in the gatehouse.

==Counsel to the rich and poor==
[[File:JuanMacías.jpg|thumb|Procession of Juan Macías]]
John Macias was well known mainly for two things during his life.  First, he was known to love the [[rosary]], which he began to pray as a child in Spain while he shepherded his uncle’s flock of sheep.  Secondly, he was known for his generosity to the poor, 200 of whom he fed every day.  He was greatly aided in this by a little donkey that he sent through Lima.  He had a small sign put on it asking for donations for the poor. The donkey, knowing his route perfectly, would travel through the streets and come back with benefactions for the city’s poor. Often the donkey would stop at certain locations and make loud noises so that the people inside would come out to make their donations.&lt;ref name=joseph&gt;[https://opeast.org/2011/09/dominican-saints-101-st-juan-macias/ "Dominican Saints 101: St. Juan Macias", Dominican Friars Province of St. Joseph, September 18, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the priory, Macías's life was filled with fervent prayer, frequent penance and charity. As a result of his austerity, he quickly fell ill and had to have a risky surgery. Nevertheless, he continued to care for other sick and needy as they waited at the friary gates. Beggars, disabled people and other disadvantaged people were commonplace throughout Lima where they flocked to him at the monastery gates for counsel and comfort. The poor came for food, and the rich for advice.&lt;ref name=Dorcy&gt;[http://www.dominicans.ca/Family/Figures/masias.htm Dorcy, Jean Marie. "Blessed John Macias", ''St. Dominic's Family'', Tan Books and Publishers, 1983]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macias, however, expressed a greater desire to spend more time in contemplative solitude rather than engage in conversational activities with others.  He confessed this to Father Abbot Ramírez who said, “If he were to never follow his vow of obedience, nobody would have ever seen his face." But his official position as the priory's [[Ostiarius|porter]], which he held for over 20 years and went against his natural inclinations of solitude, served to continue disciplining his vow of obedience.  This filled him with a joyful sense of fulfillment. He died of natural causes in 1645.

==Veneration==
[[File:Convento Santo Domingo - Lima.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Basilica and Convent of Santo Domingo]] in [[Lima]], [[Peru]] where the remains of St. John Macias rest.]]
Several miracles were attributed to Macias during his life and after his death which led to his canonization.  He was beatified, along with Martin de Porres, in 1837 by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] and canonized in 1975 by [[Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref name=joseph/&gt; His feast day is September 18.
 
An annual public procession also takes place in Peru every third Sunday of November in Lima. Macias' image, along with that of the more famous saint, [[Martin de Porres]], (his friend and fellow Dominican laybrother) are paraded around the streets and venerated by the faithful of Peru.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
The '''menstrual cycle''' is the regular natural change that occurs in the [[female reproductive system]] (specifically the [[uterus]] and [[ovary|ovaries]]) that makes [[pregnancy]] possible.&lt;ref name=Silverthorn&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Silverthorn |first1 = Dee Unglaub |title = Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach |edition=6th |publisher = Pearson Education |location = Glenview, IL |year = 2013 | isbn = 0-321-75007-1 |pages=850–890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwood&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Sherwood |first1 = Laurelee |title = Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems | edition=8th |publisher = Cengage |location = Belmont, California | year = 2013 |isbn = 1-111-57743-9 |pages=735–794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle is required for the production of oocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=Silverthorn /&gt; Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt; Common symptoms include [[acne vulgaris|acne]], tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes.&lt;ref name=Women2014PMS&gt;{{cite web|title=Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) fact sheet|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/premenstrual-syndrome.html|website=Office on Women's Health, USA|accessdate=23 June 2015|date=December 23, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628073755/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/premenstrual-syndrome.html|archivedate=28 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as [[premenstrual syndrome]] in 20 to 30% of women.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt; --&gt; In 3 to 8%, they are severe.&lt;ref name=AFP2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biggs|first1=WS|last2=Demuth|first2=RH|title=Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.|journal=[[American Family Physician]]|date=15 October 2011|volume=84|issue=8|pages=918–24|pmid=22010771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Mechanism --&gt;
The menstrual cycle is governed by hormonal changes.&lt;ref name=Women2014Men/&gt; These changes can be altered by using [[hormonal birth control]] to prevent pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klump KL, Keel PK, Racine SE, Burt SA, Burt AS, Neale M, Sisk CL, Boker S, Hu JY | title = The interactive effects of estrogen and progesterone on changes in emotional eating across the menstrual cycle | journal = J Abnorm Psychol | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = 131–7 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 22889242 | doi = 10.1037/a0029524 | pmc=3570621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each cycle can be divided into three phases based on events in the ovary (ovarian cycle) or in the uterus (uterine cycle).&lt;ref name=Silverthorn /&gt; The ovarian cycle consists of the [[follicular phase]], [[ovulation]], and [[luteal phase]] whereas the uterine cycle is divided into [[menstruation]], proliferative phase, and secretory phase.

Stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of [[estrogen]] in the follicular phase, discharges of blood (menses) flow stop, and the [[Endometrium|lining]] of the uterus thickens. [[Ovarian follicle|Follicles]] in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles shrink and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24–36 hours after the [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an [[ovocyte]], in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a [[corpus luteum]]; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of [[progesterone]]. Under the influence of progesterone, the [[endometrium|uterine lining]] changes to prepare for potential [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. The hormone drop causes the uterus to shed its lining in a process termed menstruation. Menstruation also occurs in closely related [[primate]]s ([[ape]]s and [[monkeys]]).&lt;ref name=Kris2013&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kristin H.

The cessation of menstrual cycles at the end of a woman's reproductive period is termed [[menopause]]. The average age of menopause in women is 52 years, with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common. Menopause before age 45 is considered ''premature'' in industrialised countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Clinical topic&amp;nbsp;— Menopause | work = NHS | url = http://www.cks.nhs.uk/menopause#-292420 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090707095123/http://www.cks.nhs.uk/menopause#-292420 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 7 July 2009 | accessdate = 2 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the age of menarche, the age of menopause is largely a result of cultural and biological factors;&lt;ref name=beyene&gt;{{cite book | first=Yewoubdar | last=Beyene | year=1989 | title=From Menarche to Menopause: Reproductive Lives of Peasant Women in Two Cultures | publisher=State University of New York Press| location=Albany, NY | isbn=0-88706-866-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Shuman | first = Tracy | title = Your Guide to Menopause | work = WebMD |date=February 2006 | url = http://www.webmd.com/content/article/9/2953_504.htm | accessdate = 16 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of a woman's menstrual cycle typically varies somewhat, with some shorter cycles and some longer cycles. A woman who experiences variations of less than eight days between her longest cycles and shortest cycles is considered to have regular menstrual cycles. It is unusual for a woman to experience cycle length variations of more than four days. Length variation between eight and 20 days is considered as moderately [[irregular cycles]]. Variation of 21 days or more between a woman's shortest and longest cycle lengths is considered very irregular. &lt;!--(see [[#Cycle abnormalities|cycle abnormalities]])--&gt;&lt;ref name=kippley&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Kippley |first2=Sheila |last2=Kippley |year=1996 |title=The Art of Natural Family Planning |edition=4th |publisher=The Couple to Couple League |location=Cincinnati |isbn=978-0-926412-13-2 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days. The variability of menstrual cycle lengths is highest for women under 25 years of age and is lowest, that is, most regular, for ages 25 to 39.&lt;ref name=Chiazze1968&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chiazze L, Brayer FT, Macisco JJ, Parker MP, Duffy BJ | title = The length and variability of the human menstrual cycle | journal = JAMA | volume = 203 | issue = 6 | pages = 377–80 | date = February 1968 | pmid = 5694118 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1968.03140060001001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the variability increases slightly for women aged 40 to 44.&lt;ref name=Chiazze1968/&gt;

The luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is about the same length in most individuals (mean 14.13 days, [[standard deviation]] 1.41 days)&lt;ref name=Lenton_luteal&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lenton EA, Landgren BM, Sexton L | title = Normal variation in the length of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle: identification of the short luteal phase | journal = Br J Obstet Gynaecol | volume = 91 | issue = 7 | pages = 685–9 | date = July 1984 | pmid = 6743610 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.1984.tb04831.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the follicular phase tends to show much more variability (log-normally distributed with 95% of individuals having follicular phases between 10.3 and 16.3 days).&lt;ref name=Lenton_follicular&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lenton EA, Landgren BM, Sexton L, Harper R | title = Normal variation in the length of the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle: effect of chronological age | journal = Br J Obstet Gynaecol | volume = 91 | issue = 7 | pages = 681–4 | date = July 1984 | pmid = 6743609 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.1984.tb04830.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The follicular phase also seems to get significantly shorter with age (geometric mean 14.2 days in women aged 18–24 vs. 10.4 days in women aged 40–44).&lt;ref name=Lenton_follicular /&gt;

== Health effects ==
Some women with [[Neurology|neurological conditions]] experience increased activity of their conditions at about the same time during each menstrual cycle. For example, drops in estrogen levels have been known to trigger [[migraines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyheadache.com/2006/04/linking_migrain.html |title=Migraine and Estrogen Officially Linked |publisher=The Daily Headache |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when the woman who suffers migraines is also taking the birth control pill. Many women with [[epilepsy]] have more seizures in a pattern linked to the menstrual cycle; this is called "[[catamenial epilepsy]]".&lt;ref name=pmid18164632&gt;{{cite journal | author = Herzog AG | title = Catamenial epilepsy: definition, prevalence pathophysiology and treatment | journal = Seizure | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–9 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18164632 | doi = 10.1016/j.seizure.2007.11.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different patterns seem to exist (such as seizures coinciding with the time of menstruation, or coinciding with the time of ovulation), and the frequency with which they occur has not been firmly established. Using one particular definition, one group of scientists found that around one-third of women with intractable partial epilepsy has catamenial epilepsy.&lt;ref name=pmid18164632/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid15349872&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herzog AG, Harden CL, Liporace J, Pennell P, Schomer DL, Sperling M, Fowler K, Nikolov B, Shuman S, Newman M | title = Frequency of catamenial seizure exacerbation in women with localization-related epilepsy | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 431–4 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15349872 | doi = 10.1002/ana.20214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid9579954&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herzog AG, Klein P, Ransil BJ | title = Three patterns of catamenial epilepsy | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 38 | issue = 10 | pages = 1082–8 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9579954 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1997.tb01197.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; An effect of hormones has been proposed, in which progesterone declines and estrogen increases would trigger seizures.&lt;ref name=pmid16981857&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scharfman HE, MacLusky NJ | title = The influence of gonadal hormones on neuronal excitability, seizures, and epilepsy in the female | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 47 | issue = 9 | pages = 1423–40 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16981857 | pmc = 1924802 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2006.00672.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, studies have shown that high doses of estrogen can cause or worsen seizures, whereas high doses of progesterone can act like an antiepileptic drug.&lt;ref name="epilepsy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epilepsy.com/epilepsy/provoke_menstrual |title=Menstrual cycle |publisher=epilepsy.com |accessdate=19 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015160702/https://www.epilepsy.com/EPILEPSY/provoke_menstrual |archivedate=15 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by medical journals have found that women experiencing menses are 1.68 times more likely to [[suicide attempt|attempt suicide]].&lt;ref name=SuicideRatesPsyMed&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baca-García E, Diaz-Sastre C, Ceverino A, Saiz-Ruiz J, Diaz FJ, de Leon J | title = Association between the menses and suicide attempts: a replication study | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 237–44 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12651991 | doi = 10.1097/01.PSY.0000058375.50240.F6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mice have been used as an experimental system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of [[sex steroid]] hormones might regulate [[nervous system]] function. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when progesterone is highest, the level of [[Neuron|nerve-cell]] [[GABA A receptor|GABA receptor]] subtype delta was high. Since these GABA receptors are [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]], nerve cells with more delta receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of delta receptors. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels, the number of delta receptors decrease, increasing nerve cell activity, in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility.&lt;ref name=Maguire&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maguire JL, Stell BM, Rafizadeh M, Mody I | title = Ovarian cycle-linked changes in GABA(A) receptors mediating tonic inhibition alter seizure susceptibility and anxiety | journal = Nat.

Estrogen levels may affect [[thyroid]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doufas AG, Mastorakos G | title = The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and the female reproductive system | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 900 | issue =  | pages = 65–76 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10818393 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06217.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during the luteal phase (when estrogen levels are lower), the velocity of blood flow in the thyroid is lower than during the follicular phase (when estrogen levels are higher).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krejza J, Nowacka A, Szylak A, Bilello M, Melhem LY | title = Variability of thyroid blood flow Doppler parameters in healthy women | journal = Ultrasound Med Biol | volume = 30 | issue = 7 | pages = 867–76 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15313319 | doi = 10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2004.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among women living closely together, it was once thought that the onsets of menstruation tend to [[Menstrual synchrony|synchronize]]. This effect was first described in 1971, and possibly explained by the action of [[pheromone]]s in 1998.&lt;ref name=Mclintock&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stern K, McClintock MK | title = Regulation of ovulation by human pheromones | journal = Nature | volume = 392 | issue = 6672 | pages = 177–9 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9515961 | doi = 10.1038/32408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Adams | first = Cecil | authorlink = Cecil Adams | title = Does menstrual synchrony really exist? | work = The Straight Dope | publisher = The Chicago Reader | date = 20 December 2002 | url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/021220.html | accessdate = 10 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most fertile period (the time with the highest likelihood of pregnancy resulting from [[sexual intercourse]]) covers the time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation.&lt;ref&gt;Weschler (2002), pp.242,374&lt;/ref&gt; In a 28‑day cycle with a 14‑day luteal phase, this corresponds to the second and the beginning of the third week. A variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle; these systems are called [[fertility awareness]].

There are many [[fertility testing]] methods, including [[Urinalysis|urine test]] kits that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs).&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|007062|LH urine test (home test)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called [[fertility monitors]]. Fertility awareness methods that rely on cycle length records alone are called [[calendar-based methods]].&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite journal |title=Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use:Fertility awareness-based methods | version = Third edition |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2004 |url=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/mec/fab.html |accessdate=29 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods that require observation of one or more of the three primary fertility signs ([[basal body temperature]], [[cervical mucus]], and cervical position)&lt;ref&gt;Weschler (2002), p.52&lt;/ref&gt; are known as symptoms-based methods.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

However, despite this hypothesis, a similar [[paternal age effect]] has also been observed.

As measured on women undergoing [[in vitro fertilization]], a longer menstrual cycle length is associated with higher pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment.&lt;ref name="Brodin2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brodin T, Bergh T, Berglund L, Hadziosmanovic N, Holte J | title = Menstrual cycle length is an age-independent marker of female fertility: Results from 6271 treatment cycles of in vitro fertilization | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 90 | issue = 5 | pages = 1656–1661 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18155201 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.09.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delivery rate]]s after IVF have been estimated to be almost doubled for women with a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with women with a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days.&lt;ref name="Brodin2008"/&gt; A longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to [[gonadotropin]] stimulation and [[embryo quality]].&lt;ref name="Brodin2008"/&gt;

=== Mood and behavior ===
The different phases of the menstrual cycle correlate with women's [[Mood (psychology)|moods]]. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmidt PJ, Nieman LK, Danaceau MA, Adams LF, Rubinow DR | title = Differential behavioral effects of gonadal steroids in women with and in those without premenstrual syndrome | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 338 | issue = 4 | pages = 209–16 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9435325 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199801223380401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian [[hormones]] may contribute to increased [[empathy]] in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different phases of the menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the [[Follicular phase|follicular stage]] of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their [[Luteal phase|midluteal phase]]. A significant correlation between [[progesterone]] levels and the ability to accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on [[emotion recognition]] tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. Women in the follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Derntl B, Hack RL, Kryspin-Exner I, Habel U | title = Association of menstrual cycle phase with the core components of empathy | journal = Horm Behav | volume = 63 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–104 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23098806 | pmc = 3549494 | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.10.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, it has been found that women in the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.

[[Fear processing in the brain|Fear response]] in women during two different points in the menstrual cycle has been examined. When [[oestrogen|estrogen]] is highest in the [[Preovulatory|preovulatory stage]], women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwartz DH, Romans SE, Meiyappan S, De Souza MJ, Einstein G | title = The role of ovarian steroid hormones in mood | journal = Horm Behav | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 448–54 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22902271 | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the examination of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of [[stress (biology)|stress]] or physical health, the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pearson R, Lewis MB | title = Fear recognition across the menstrual cycle | journal = Horm Behav | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–71 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15708754 | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2004.11.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.

Sexual feelings and behaviors change during the menstrual cycle.

With regard to women's smell across the cycle, some evidence indicates that men use olfactory cues in order to know if a woman is ovulating.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Using a rating of women's odors, women who are ovulating have been rated as more attractive by men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Men demonstrate preferences for the scent of fertile women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Preferences for body features can change during the fertile phase of the cycle. Women seeking a short-term partner demonstrate a preference for taller and muscular males.&lt;ref name=Thorn2008 /&gt; Women also show preferences of males with masculine bodies at peak fertility.&lt;ref name=Thorn2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Mixed research has been found regarding body symmetry preferences throughout different phases of the cycle.&lt;ref name=Thorn2008 /&gt;

In short term mates, during the fertile phase, women may show more attraction to dominant men who display social presence.&lt;ref name=Thorn2008 /&gt; For long-term mates, shifts in desired trait preferences do not occur throughout the cycle.&lt;ref name=Thorn2008 /&gt;

=== Eating behavior ===
Females have been found to experience different eating habits at different stages of their menstrual cycle, with food intake being higher during the [[luteal phase]] than the [[follicular phase]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Dye| first = L.| last2 = Blundell| first2 = J.

Various studies have shown that during the luteal phase woman consume more [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s and [[fat]]s and that 24-hour [[Energy homeostasis|energy expenditure]] shows increases between 2.5-11.5%.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidsen|first=L.|last2=Vistisen|first2=B.|last3=Astrup|first3=A.|date=2007-08-07|title=Impact of the menstrual cycle on determinants of energy balance: a putative role in weight loss attempts|url=http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v31/n12/full/0803699a.html|journal=International Journal of Obesity|language=en|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1777–1785|doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803699|issn=0307-0565}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing intake during the luteal phase may be related to higher preferences for sweet and fatty foods, which occurs naturally and is enhanced during the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This is due to the higher metabolic demand during this phase.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; In particular, women tend to show a cravings for chocolate, with higher cravings during the luteal phase.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Females with [[premenstrual syndrome]] (PMS) report  changes in appetite across the menstrual cycle more than non-sufferers of PMS, possibly due to their oversensitivity to changes in hormone levels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In women with PMS, food intake is higher in the [[luteal phase]] than [[Follicular phase|follicular]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wurtman|first=Judith J.|last2=Brzezinski|first2=Amnon|last3=Wurtman|first3=Richard J.|last4=Laferrere|first4=Blandine|title=Effect of nutrient intake on premenstrual depression|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0002937889906716|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=161|issue=5|pages=1228–1234|doi=10.1016/0002-9378(89)90671-6|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining symptoms of PMS, including mood changes and physical symptoms, also occur during the luteal phase. No difference for preference of food types has been found between PMS sufferers and non-sufferers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The different levels of [[ovarian hormones]] at different stages of the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, with a high [[estrogen]] level dopamine is ineffective in converting to [[Norepinephrine|noradrenaline]], a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence [[binge eating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klump|first=K.

It is theorized that the use of [[oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]s should affect eating behaviour as they minimise or remove the fluctuations in hormone levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]] is also thought to play a role in food intake.

A number of factors affect whether dieting will affect these menstrual processes: age, weight loss and the diet itself. First, younger women are likely to experience [[Irregular menstruation|menstrual irregularities]] due to their diet. Second, menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss. For example, [[anovulatory cycle]]s can occur as a result of adopting a restricted diet, as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Finally, the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dye|first=L.|last2=Blundell|first2=J.

The level of substance abuse increases with PMS, mostly with addictive substances such as [[nicotine]], [[tobacco]] and [[cocaine]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; One theory behind this suggests this higher level of substance abuse is due to decreased self-control as a result of the higher metabolic demands during the luteal phase.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== Menstrual disorders === &lt;!-- [[Irregular]] refers to here --&gt;
{{main|Menstrual disorder}}
Infrequent or irregular ovulation is called ''oligoovulation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Galan | first = Nicole | title = Oligoovulation | publisher = about.com | date = 16 April 2008 | url = http://pcos.about.com/od/glossary/g/oligoovulation.htm | accessdate = 12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of ovulation is called ''[[anovulation]]''. Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it: an [[anovulatory cycle]]. In some cycles, follicular development may start but not be completed; nevertheless, estrogens will be formed and  stimulate the uterine lining. Anovulatory flow resulting from a very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called ''estrogen breakthrough bleeding''. Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called [[withdrawal bleeding]].&lt;ref name=tcoyf3&gt;Weschler (2002), p.107&lt;/ref&gt; Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before [[menopause]] (perimenopause) and in women with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]].&lt;ref name=emed2&gt;{{EMedicine|med|146|Anovulation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little flow (less than 10 ml) is called ''[[hypomenorrhea]]''. Regular cycles with intervals of 21 days or fewer are ''[[polymenorrhea]]''; frequent but irregular menstruation is known as ''[[metrorrhagia]]''. Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed ''[[menorrhagia]]''.&lt;ref name=emed1&gt;{{EMedicine|ped|2781|Menstruation Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is ''[[menometrorrhagia]]''.

== Cycles and phases ==
[[File:MenstrualCycle3 en.svg|thumb|350px|right|Menstrual cycle]]
[[File:Menstrual cycle diagram.png|thumb|350px|right|Flowchart of the hormonal control of the menstrual cycle]]
The menstrual cycle can be described by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the [[Endometrium|endometrial lining]] of the uterus.  Both cycles can be divided into three phases.  The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.&lt;ref name=Silverthorn /&gt;

=== Ovarian cycle ===

==== Follicular phase ====
{{main|Follicular phase}}
The follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg.&lt;ref name=Silverthorn /&gt; The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.

Through the influence of a rise in [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few [[ovarian follicle]]s are stimulated.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt; These follicles, which were present at birth&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt; and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance. Under the influence of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary or Graafian follicle, and it contains the ovum.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt;

==== Ovulation ====
{{main|Ovulation}}
[[File:ovulation.jpg|thumb|An ovary about to release an egg]]

Ovulation is the second phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukefertilitycenter.org/tests/ovulation-assessment/ Ovulation Test] at Duke Fertility Center. Retrieved 2 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; During the follicular phase, [[estradiol]] suppresses release of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) from the [[anterior pituitary gland]]. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of [[estradiol]] reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day&amp;nbsp;12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnology.com/ovulate/16/2/10/1/15/2013|title=Ovulation Calendar|publisher=Pregnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact mechanism of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol is not well understood.&lt;ref name=Lentz&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lentz, Gretchen M; Lobo, Rogerio A.; Gershenson, David M; Katz, Vern L.|title=Comprehensive gynecology.|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|location=St. Louis|isbn=978-0-323-06986-1|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/books/page.do?eid=4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195&amp;isbn=978-0-323-06986-1&amp;sid=1291988935&amp;uniqId=327920693-3#4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In animals, a [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) surge has been shown to precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion.&lt;ref name=Lentz /&gt; This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: [[estrogen receptor alpha]], which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and [[estrogen receptor beta]], which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu L, Gustofson RL, Feng H, Leung PK, Mores N, Krsmanovic LZ, Catt KJ | title = Converse regulatory functions of estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta subtypes expressed in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons | journal = Mol.

The release of LH matures the egg and weakens the wall of the follicle in the ovary, causing the fully developed follicle to release its [[secondary oocyte]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt; If it is fertilized by a sperm, the secondary oocyte promptly matures into an [[ootid]] and then becomes a mature [[ovum]]. If it is not fertilized by a sperm, the secondary oocyte will degenerate. The mature ovum has a diameter of about 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gray, Henry David |title=Anatomy of the human body |chapter=The Ovum |publisher=Bartleby.com |location=Philadelphia |year=2000 |chapterurl=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/gray/subjects/subject/3 |isbn=1-58734-102-6 |accessdate=5 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725031743/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/gray/subjects/subject/3 |archivedate=25 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being released from the ovary, the egg is swept into the [[fallopian tube]] by the [[Fimbria (female reproductive system)|fimbria]], which is a fringe of tissue at the end of each fallopian tube. After about a day, an unfertilized egg will disintegrate or dissolve in the fallopian tube.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt;

Fertilization by a [[spermatozoon]], when it occurs, usually takes place in the [[Ampulla of uterine tube|ampulla]], the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg immediately begins the process of [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], or development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt; It has usually reached the [[blastocyst]] stage at the time of implantation.

In some women, ovulation features a characteristic pain called ''[[mittelschmerz]]'' (German term meaning ''middle pain'').&lt;ref name=allmenses/&gt; The sudden change in hormones at the time of ovulation sometimes also causes light mid-cycle blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;Weschler (2002), p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Luteal phase ====
{{main|Luteal phase}}
The luteal phase is the final phase of the ovarian cycle and it corresponds to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt; Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Weschler (2002), p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg.  The [[syncytiotrophoblast]], which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the [[blastocyst]]) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which preserves the corpus luteum.  The corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy.  Most [[pregnancy test]]s look for the presence of hCG.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt;

=== Uterine cycle ===
The uterine cycle has three phases: menses, proliferative, secretory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Textbook of Medical Physiology | chapter = Chapter 81 Female Physiology Before Pregnancy and Female Hormones |pages =  1018ff  | edition = 11th |editors= Guyton AC and Hall JE|publisher = Elsevier Saunders | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780721602400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Menstruation ====
{{main|Menstruation}}
Menstruation (also called menstrual bleeding, menses, catamenia or a period) is the first phase of the uterine cycle. The flow of menses normally serves as a sign that a woman has not become [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. (However, this cannot be taken as certainty, as a number of factors can cause [[Vaginal bleeding#Pregnant women|bleeding during pregnancy]]; some factors are specific to [[First trimester bleeding|early pregnancy]], and some can cause [[Obstetrical hemorrhage|heavy flow]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenfield |first=Marjorie |title=Subchorionic Hematoma in Early Pregnancy |work=Ask Our Experts |publisher=DrSpock.com |date=17 September 2001 |url=http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,8334,00.html |accessdate=21 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915192741/http://www.drspock.com/faq/0%2C1511%2C8334%2C00.html |archivedate=15 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Anderson-Berry | first = Ann L |author2=Terence Zach | title = Vanishing Twin Syndrome | journal = Emedicine.com | publisher = WebMD | date = 10 December 2007 | url = http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC3411.HTM | accessdate = 21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ko | first = Patrick |author2=Young Yoon | title = Placenta Previa | journal = Emedicine.com | publisher = WebMD | date = 23 August 2007 | url = http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic427.htm | accessdate = 21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Painful cramping in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs is common during the first few days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as [[dysmenorrhea]], and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharma P, Malhotra C, Taneja DK, Saha R | title = Problems related to menstruation amongst adolescent girls | journal = Indian J Pediatr | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–9 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18334791 | doi = 10.1007/s12098-008-0018-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When menstruation begins, symptoms of [[premenstrual syndrome]] (PMS) such as [[mastalgia|breast tenderness]] and irritability generally decrease.&lt;ref name=allmenses/&gt; Many [[Menstruation#Menstrual products|sanitary products]] are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.

==== Proliferative phase ====

The proliferative phase is the second phase of the uterine cycle when estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Losos | first1 = Jonathan B. | last2 = Raven | first2 = Peter H. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = George B. | last4 = Singer | first4 = Susan R. | title = Biology | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2002 | pages = 1207–09 | isbn = 0-07-303120-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of [[estradiol]], and [[estrogen]]. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of [[endometrium]] in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates [[Crypt (anatomy)|crypts]] in the [[cervix]] to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing [[fertility awareness]].&lt;ref name=tcoyf2&gt;{{cite book | first=Toni | last=Weschler | year=2002 | title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility | pages=359–361 | edition=Revised | publisher=HarperCollins | location=New York | isbn=0-06-093764-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Secretory phase ====

The secretory phase is the final phase of the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the [[endometrium]] receptive to [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of the [[blastocyst]] and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the [[smooth muscle]] in the uterus;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lombardi, Julian|title=Comparative Vertebrate Reproduction|publisher=Springer|year=1998|isbn=9780792383369|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqQX9RMPAegC&amp;pg=PA184}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's [[basal body temperature]].&lt;ref name=tcoyf&gt;Weschler (2002), pp.361-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ovulation suppression ==

=== Birth control ===
{{main|Hormonal contraception}}
[[File:pillpacketopen.jpg|thumb|right|Half-used blister pack of a combined oral contraceptive. The white pills are [[placebos]], mainly for the purpose of reminding the woman to continue taking the pills.]]
While some forms of [[birth control]] do not affect the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen [[negative feedback]] decreases the pulse frequency of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) release by the [[hypothalamus]], which decreases the release of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the [[anterior pituitary]]. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen [[positive feedback]] on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.&lt;ref name=hatcher&gt;{{cite book |author=Trussell, James |year=2007 |chapter=Contraceptive Efficacy |editor=Hatcher, Robert A. |display-editors=etal |title=Contraceptive Technology |edition=19th rev. |pages= |location=New York |publisher=Ardent Media |isbn=0-9664902-0-7 |chapterurl=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=speroff&gt;{{cite book |author1=Speroff, Leon |author2=Darney, Philip D. |year=2005 |chapter=Oral Contraception |title=A Clinical Guide for Contraception |edition=4th |pages=21–138 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=0-7817-6488-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loose&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Laurence L. |editor1-last=Brunton |editor2-first=John S. |editor2-last=Lazo |editor3-first=Keith |editor3-last=Parker |title=[[Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]] |edition=11th |pages=1541–71| publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2005 | isbn=0-07-142280-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of ovulation suppression in progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the [[progestogen]] activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives—traditional [[progestogen only pill]]s, [[subdermal implant]]s [[Norplant]] and Jadelle, and [[IntraUterine System|intrauterine system]] Mirena—inhibit ovulation in about 50% of cycles and rely mainly on other effects, such as thickening of cervical mucus, for their contraceptive effectiveness.&lt;ref name=glasier&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Anna Glasier|Glasier]] |first=Anna |editor=DeGroot, Leslie J. |editor2=Jameson, J. Larry |title=Endocrinology |edition=5th |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-7216-0376-9 |pages=3000–1 |chapter=Contraception}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives—the progestogen-only pill Cerazette and the subdermal implant [[Nexplanon]]—allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low-dose progestogens. High-dose, progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables [[Depo-Provera]] and Noristerat—completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.&lt;ref name=glasier/&gt;

Combined hormonal contraceptives include both an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular [[breakthrough bleeding]].&lt;ref name=hatcher/&gt;&lt;ref name=speroff/&gt;&lt;ref name=loose/&gt; Several combined hormonal contraceptives—[[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], [[NuvaRing]], and the [[contraceptive patch]]—are usually used in a way that causes regular [[withdrawal bleeding]]. In a normal cycle, [[menstruation]] occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly.&lt;ref name=tcoyf/&gt; Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be [[extended cycle combined hormonal contraceptive|taken continuously]], although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.

=== Breastfeeding ===
{{main|Lactational amenorrhea method}}
[[Breastfeeding]] causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending on the strength of the negative feedback, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume.&lt;ref name=mcneilly&gt;{{cite journal | author = McNeilly AS | title = Lactational control of reproduction | journal = Reprod.

=== Etymological ===
The word "menstruation" is etymologically related to "moon".

      <comment>Updating information on the page and correcting it: OHSAS 18001 was not more specific to British needs - it was developed internationally - see Development - nor did the cited reference say it was; nor was it especially for the O&amp;G sector, which again, the cited reference did not state.</comment>

[[File:OHSAS 18001-Borjpardis.jpg|thumbnail|Certificate of conformity to OHSAS 18001:2007]]
'''OHSAS 18001''', Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, (officially '''BS OHSAS 18001''') is a [[British Standard]] for occupational health and safety [[management system]]s. Compliance with it enables organizations to demonstrate that they have a system in place for occupational health and safety. BS OHSAS 18001 is being replaced by [[ISO 45001|ISO 45001]], which was published in March 2018 by the [[International Organization for Standardization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ISO 45001 |url=https://www.iso.org/iso-45001-occupational-health-and-safety.html |website=www.iso.org |publisher=ISO official website |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations which are certified to BS OHSAS 18001 should migrate to ISO 45001 by March 2021 if they want to retain a recognized certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iso.org/news/ref2270.html|title=Let the migration begin|work=ISO|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Origins==
Organizations worldwide recognize the need to control and improve health and safety performance and do so with occupational health and safety management systems (OHSMS). However, before 1999 there was an increase of national standards and proprietary certification schemes to choose from. This caused confusion and fragmentation in the market and undermined the credibility of individual schemes.

==Development==

Recognising this deficit, an international collaboration called the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) Project Group was formed to create a single unified approach. The Group comprised representatives from [[Standards organisation#National standards bodies|national standards bodies]], academic bodies, accreditation bodies, certification bodies and occupational safety and health institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_091362.pdf|title=International Labour Office Report, Page 2, Footnote 3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the UK’s national standards body, [[BSI Group]], providing the secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iso14000expert.com/publications/OHSASsurvey.pdf|title=Occupational Health and Safety (OH&amp;S) Management Systems,Standards and Certificates Survey - to 31 December 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on the best of existing standards and schemes, the OHSAS Project Group published the OHSAS 18000 Series in 1999. The Series consisted of two specifications: 18001 provided requirements for an OHS management system and 18002 gave implementation guidelines. As of 2005, around 16,000 organizations in more than 80 countries were using the OHSAS 18001 specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en/Assessment-and-certification-services/management-systems/Business-areas/Occupational-health-and-safety-management/Updated-OHSAS-18001-coming-in-July/|title=BS OHSAS 18001 - Occupational Health &amp; Safety - BSI Group|website=www.bsigroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009 more than 54,000 certificates had been issued in 116 countries to OHSAS or equivalent OHSMS standards.

==Adoption as British Standard==
The OHSAS 18001 specification was updated in July 2007. Among other changes, the new specification was more closely aligned with the structures of [[ISO 9000]] and [[ISO 14000]] so that organizations could more easily adopt OHSAS 18001 alongside existing management systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/LocalFiles/en-GB/iso-45001/Resources/BSI-ISO45001-Revision-Whitepaper-EN-UK.pdf|title=ISO 45001 Whitepaper: A new International Standard for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=BSIgroup.com|publisher=[[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]]|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the "health" component of "health and safety" was given greater emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en/about-bsi/News-Room/BSI-News-Content/Disciplines/Risk-Management/BS-OHSAS-180012007/|title=Press releases, news, media centre, standards, ISO, 9001, 14001, 18001 - BSI Group|website=www.bsigroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Later, the BSI Group decided to adopt OHSAS 18001 as a British standard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; BSI Group subsequently adopted the updated 18002 guidance specification for publication as BS OHSAS 18002 in 2008.

==How they work==
{{technical|section|date=June 2013}}
Its supporters claim that an occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS) promotes a safe and healthy working environment by providing a framework that helps organizations to:
* Identify and control health and safety risks
* Reduce the potential for accidents
* Aid legal compliance
* Improve overall performance

The OHSAS 18000 standards provide organizations with the elements of an effective safety management system which can be integrated with other management systems and help organizations achieve better occupational health and safety performance and economic objectives.

BS OHSAS 18001 specifies requirements for an OH&amp;S management system to help an organization develop and implement a policy and objectives, which take into account legal requirements and information about OH&amp;S risks. It applies to all types and sizes of organizations and accommodates diverse geographical, cultural and social conditions.

BS OHSAS 18002 provides guidance for establishing, implementing or improving a management system which is based on OHSAS 18001 and demonstrating successful implementation of OHSAS 18001.

OHSAS 18001 can be aligned with existing ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 management systems. Historically many organizations start with the quality management system ISO 9001, then add the environment management requirements from ISO 14001. Many organizations now look at implementing all three standards at once which can minimize costs and disruption. The standards can be integrated using a standard such as BSI’s [[PAS 99]].

==Disambiguation==
The OHSAS 18000 standards were written and published wholly outside of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) framework. To avoid confusion, [[ISO/IEC 18000|ISO 18000]] does exist – but it is a [[radio-frequency identification]] standard.

==Classification of obesity==
Weight is measured by using the Body Mass Index scale (BMI). This is determined by dividing weight in kilograms by height in metres, squared. If someone is overweight their BMI will be at 25 or more.&lt;ref name="government"/&gt; If someone is obese their BMI will be at 30 or more.

==Prevalence of obesity in the Australian population==
1 in 4 children are overweight (25%) and 2 in 3 adults are overweight (63%)

===Australian adults===

In a study published in 2015 by the US Journal of Economics and Human Biology, obesity is found to have the largest impact on men aged over 75, and women aged between 60-74.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Obesity+and+health+expenditures%3A+Evidence+from+Australia&amp;rft.jtitle=Economics+%26+Human+Biology&amp;rft.au=Buchmueller%2C+Thomas+C&amp;rft.au=Johar%2C+Meliyanni&amp;rft.date=2015-04-01&amp;rft.issn=1570-677X&amp;rft.eissn=1873-6130&amp;rft.volume=17&amp;rft.spage=42&amp;rft.epage=58&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.ehb.2015.01.001&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=10_1016_j_ehb_2015_01_001&amp;paramdict=en-US |title=Obesity and health expenditures.

In 2005, a study was conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that compared the results of a 2004-05 survey with those conducted in the preceding 15 years. The results showed an increase in the number and proportion of adults who are overweight or obese. Over the four surveys, the number of overweight or obese adults increased from 4.6 million in 1989-90 to 5.4 million in 1995, 6.6 million in 2001 and 7.4 million in 2004-05.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/A54D036CCD28533ACA2573DA001C9166/$File/47190_2004-05.pdf |title=Overweight and Obesity in Adults |date=2004 |website=Australian Bureau of Statistics |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) found that 67.4% of Australian adults are overweight,&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/07/worlds-fattest-countries-forbeslife-cx_ls_0208worldfat_2.html |title=World's Fattest Countries |accessdate=12 February 2009 |author=Lauren Streib |date=8 February 2007 |work= |publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranking 21st in the world, and third out of the major countries in the [[English-speaking world]], behind the [[Obesity in the United States|United States]] (ranked 9th) and [[Obesity in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (ranked 17th).&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt; A 2005 WHO study found that just over 20% of Australian adults are obese,&lt;ref name="parliament" /&gt; which is expected to rise to roughly 29% in 2010 if current trends continue. (Update) about 29 to 30% of Australians are obese in 2017.&lt;ref name="parliament" /&gt;

In the 2005 National Health Survey, 53.6% of Australians reported being overweight with 18% falling into the "obese" category. Those numbers rose to 65% overweight and 29% obese in 2016.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;[http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/aus/ah06/ah06-c07.pdf National Health Survey stats]&lt;/ref&gt; This is nearly double the reported number from 1995, when 30% of adults were overweight and 11% were obese.&lt;ref name="government"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/Publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-hlthwt-obesity.htm |title=About Overweight and Obesity |publisher=The Department of Health, Australian Government  |access-date=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such representations would be skewed downward as people tend to overestimate their height and under-report their weight, the two key criteria to determine a BMI reading.&lt;ref name="parliament" /&gt; In the National Health Survey, obesity reports were fairly common across the board, with no major outliers. [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] had the lowest incidence of obesity, at 17.0% of the population, with [[South Australia]] reporting the highest numbers at 19.6%.&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt; By 2014, [[Canberra]] recorded an obesity rate of 25% which was placing significant strain on ageing health care infrastructure.&lt;ref name="ocp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/obesity-crisis-proves-a-weighty-issue-for-canberra-hospital-20140428-37ebm.html |title=Obesity crisis proves a weighty issue for Canberra Hospital |author=Ewa Kretowicz |accessdate=29 April 2014 |date=29 April 2014 |work=The Canberra Times |publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by The Obesity Society, between 2001 and 2025, the adult population prevalence of normal healthy weight will decrease from 40.6% to 22.9%. In conjunction with this, the prevalence of obesity will increase from 20.5% to 33.9%. It is also estimated that by the time 25- to 29-year-olds of 2000 reach the age of 60-64 (2040), over one third will be obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title=Projected Progression of the Prevalence of Obesity in Australia |date=April 2012 |journal=Obesity |doi= 10.1038/oby.2010.338|pmid=|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study reported that based on figures from the National Health Survey and/or Australian Health Survey the prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 56.3% in 1995 to 61.2% in 2007–2008 and 62.8% in 2011–2012. This was attributed largely to an increase in the level of obesity from 18.7% to 27.5% over the period, with the proportion of overweight adults remaining similar (35.3–37.6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/5/e010405.full |title=Socioeconomic disadvantage and its implications for population health planning of obesity and overweight, using cross-sectional data from general practices from a regional catchment in Australia |vauthors=Ghosh A, Charlton K, Batterham M |date=3 May 2016 |journal=BMJ Open |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010405| access-date = 5 May 2016 |issue=5 |volume=6 |pages=e010405}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study argues for preventive health measures to be gender-specific and specific to socioeconomic disadvantage within populations.

Age-standardization of the 2011-12 Australian Health Survey was done in a recent study which reported 28.3% of Australian adults to be obese with 63.4% adults being overweight or obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-14-557 |title=Using data from patient interactions in primary care for population level chronic disease surveillance: The Sentinel Practices Data Sourcing (SPDS) project |vauthors=Ghosh A, Charlton K, Girdo L, Batterham M |date=5 June 2014 |journal=BMC Public Health |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-557| access-date = 2 Jan 2015 |issue=1 |volume=14 |pmid=24899119 |pmc=4077676}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent analysis published in 2016 reported that despite of obesity and overweight together being the second highest contributor to the burden of disease in Australia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overweight and obesity |publisher=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare |url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/overweight-and-obesity/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the regular screening and recording of measures of obesity and overweight in primary care setting especially within regional Australian catchments was much lower than optimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajr.12264/full |title=Depressed, anxious and breathless missing out: Weight screening in general practice in a regional catchment of New South Wales |last=Ghosh A |first=Abhijeet |date=23 Dec 2015 |journal=Australian Journal of Rural Health |doi=10.1111/ajr.12264|access-date = 19 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indigenous population ===
Indigenous Australians have Australia's highest level of obesity.&lt;ref name="abc2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200312/s1006987.htm |title=Obesity epidemic hits Indigenous Australia |accessdate=5 July 2009 |date=10 December 2003 |work= |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 study showing that 31% of [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]] were obese, nearly double the national average at that time.&lt;ref name="abc2"/&gt;

The health and well being of Australian Indigenous youth is becoming increasingly concerning.  A cross sectional study (Valery, Moloney, Cotterill, Harris, Sinha &amp; Green, 2009) found that 46% of the total population, of participants, were overweight or obese. Of that population, 38% had enlarged waist circumferences, 43% had acanthosis nigricans present and 27% had hypertension. With this high population of overweight and obese Indigenous youth, it puts major implications on the public [[Health care in Australia|health system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title=Prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in Indigenous Australian youths |last=Valery, Moloney, Cotterill, Harris, Sinha &amp; Green |date=2009 |journal=Obesity Reviews |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X2008.00545 |pmid=|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[University of Alberta]] study, conducted in 2006, noted that 60% of Aboriginal Australians over the age of 35 in Western Australia tested positive for [[Type 2 diabetes|diabetes]].&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5ieXed7l8XssHRLx1_B9Iuq7SfjuQ |title=International study links Aboriginal health, lifestyle, local decision-making |accessdate=5 July 2009 |date=3 July 2009 |work= |publisher=The Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health issues such as heart disease, obesity, and diabetes have lowered the life expectancy for Aboriginal Australians to 17&amp;nbsp;years below the national life expectancy, a gap that continues to grow.&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt;

Professor Paul Zimmet at Monash University, who conducted the aforementioned study of diabetes rates amongst Asian immigrants, released figures at the Diabetes in Indigenous People Forum in Melbourne, estimating the rate of diabetes from poor diet at 24% of all Torres Strait Islanders&lt;ref name="couriermail"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,20745401-5003426,00.html |title=Threat to entire races |accessdate=5 July 2009 |author=Tamara McLean |date=13 November 2006 |work= |publisher=The Courier-Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remarked that unless extra steps are taken with these groups, Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders will die out within 100 years.&lt;ref name="couriermail" /&gt;

=== Immigrant populations ===

First-generation immigrants to Australia are more obese and have higher rates of obesity-related behaviours than white Australians or Australians of foreign ancestry whose families have been in the country at least two generations.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} A study conducted by the International Diabetes Institute at [[Monash University]] showed that Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Middle Eastern immigrants who moved to Australia were diagnosed with diabetes at a higher level than the average.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The increase was explained by the adoption of a Western diet in place of a more healthy "traditional" diet more common in their native countries, as well as adopting a more sedentary lifestyle which is ubiquitous in developed countries.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Australian children===
{{See|Childhood obesity in Australia}}

The percentage of overweight and obese children in Australia, despite rapid increases in the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, have remained mostly steady for the past 10 years, with 23 to 24% of Australians under the age of 18 classified as overweight, and 5 to 6% of the same demographic classified as obese.&lt;ref name="australian2" /&gt;

A study done by Nichols et al. (2011) found there has been a decreasing trend in overweight and obese preschool children, in Victoria, between 1999 and 2007. Among 2-year-old children, there was a decrease in  the obesity of these children from 13.5% in 1999 to 12.4% in 2007 and in the 3.5-year-old children a substantial decrease from 18.5% in 1999 to 15.4% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title=Decreasing trends in overweight and obesity among an Australian population of preschool children. |last=Nichols, de Silva-Sanigorski, Cleary, Goldfeld, Colahan &amp; Swinburn |date=2011 |journal=International Journal of Obesity |doi=10.1038/ijo.2011.64 |pmid=|access-date = |volume=35 |pages=916–924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased media attention on [[childhood obesity]], in 2007 and 2008 especially, caused many researchers to print findings that the rate of obesity for children has reached a plateau&lt;ref name="australian2" /&gt; or that the claims are simply "exaggerated."&lt;ref name="australian2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/05/31/1211654356335.html |title=Obesity epidemic exaggerated: report |accessdate=5 July 2009 |date=31 May 2008 |work= |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports caused Dr. [[Rosanna Capolingua]], President of the [[Australian Medical Association]], to issue a statement admonishing people and media outlets for "trivialising" the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://growingupinaustralia.gov.au/pubs/asr/2015/asr2015c.html#c3-8 |title=AMA: Don't trivialise childhood obesity |accessdate=5 July 2009 |date=31 May 2008 |work= |publisher=The Courier-Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Western Australian study (Bell et al. 2011) showed that overweight and obese primary school children have greater medical complications due to their weight status.  Overweight and obese children were more likely to complain and suffer from [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], bullying, headaches, enuresis and musculoskeletal pain. The most common site of the musculoskeletal pain was in the knees with overweight children 1.3 times and obese children 3 times more likely to complain about it than the control children.  Overweight and obese children also had significantly higher levels of hypertension (control 3.4%, overweight 7.3%, obese 19%), impaired glucose tolerance (control: normal, overweight 1.3%, obese 5.3%) and hyperinsulinism (control 8%, overweight 19.5%, obese 38.9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title=High incidence of obesity co-morbidities in young children: A cross sectional study |last=Bell, Curran, Bryne, Roby, Surinano, Jones &amp; Davis. |date=2011 |journal=Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1754.2011.02102 |pmid=|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of public health interventions in child care services has been recommended in Australia as a key strategy in the prevention of children becoming overweight or obese, especially in rural and remote areas of Australia. Quantifying the prevalence of obesity among children attending child care from non-metropolitan areas throughout Australia may be particularly important as the access to obesity prevention resources and professional development opportunities for child care service staff is limited. Financial constraints often experienced by smaller rural and remote child care services may limit their capacity to promote and encourage physical activity and health care to children participating in the child care services provided to them.

The study conducted by Wolfenden et al. found that approximately 17% of all children and 25% of indigenous children attending rural and regional child care services in the study area were overweight or obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolfenden |first1=Luke |last2=Hardy |first2=Louise L. |last3=Wiggers |first3=John |last4=Milat |first4=Andrew J. |last5=Bell |first5=Colin |last6=Sutherland |first6=Rachel |date=March 2011 |title=Prevalence and socio-demographic associations of overweight and obesity among children attending child care services in rural and regional Australia |work=Nutrition and Dietetics |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=15–20 |doi=10.1111/j.1747-0080.2010.01487.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such prevalence rates remain unacceptably high and confirm the need of prevention interventions targeting obesity in this setting.

For childhood obesity, the influence of broader parental and community contexts needs to be considered. Studies have found that young overweight boys spent significantly less time away from their parents than non-overweight boys, this potentially relates to the socio-economic status of the parents, as children residing from parents with a lower education level are at a higher risk of suffering from being overweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1754.2011.02181.x/abstract |title=Socio-economic, familial and perinatal factors associated with obesity in Sydney schoolchildren |last=gopinath baur burlutsky robaei mitchell |first=bamini louise george dana paul |date=January 2012 |journal=Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1754.2011.02181.x |pmid=|access-date = |issue=1 |volume=48 |pages=44–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that this is because young boys that spent a lot of their time with their parents were more likely to participate in sedentary activities, such as watching television or playing video games, than they were to participate in any kind of physical activity.

Jones et al. (2010) study found that early school years may be the time when child, parent and community characteristics begin to differ between overweight and non-overweight children, and may be an ideal time to target broader parental and community contexts influencing overweight and obese children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=RA |last2=Okely |first2=AD |last3=Caputi |first3=P |last4=Cliff |first4=DP |date=May 2010 |title=Relationships between child, parent and community characteristics and weight status among young children |work=International Journal of Pediatric Obesity |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=256–264 |pmid=19900149 |doi=10.3109/17477160903271971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study conducted by The Swiss School of Public Health in 2014, found a clear association between the prevalence of obesity in low socio-economic standing school children within Australia. In 2006, it was found that children of low socio-economic standing were 2.22 times more likely to be obese compared to their high socio-economic standing counterparts. It was also discovered that these children of low socio-economic standing were 2.20 times more likely to be obese in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title=Prevalence of obesity, overweight and thinness in Australian children and adolescents by socioeconomic status and ethnic cultural group in 2006 and 2012 |date=5 September 2014 |journal=International Journal of Public Health |doi= |pmid=|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diabetes and cost of obesity==

In May 2008, [[Diabetes Australia]], the national body for diabetes awareness and prevention, told the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] that the cost of obesity on the country's health system in 2005 was an estimated [[Australian dollar|A$]]25&amp;nbsp;billion (US$20&amp;nbsp;billion),&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/05/12/2242348.htm |title=Obesity costing Australia billions |accessdate=5 July 2009 |date=12 May 2008 |work= |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, Diabetes Australia's estimation more than doubled to $58&amp;nbsp;billion ($46&amp;nbsp;billion USD), this time taking into account not just health care but job productivity and other related quality of living costs.&lt;ref name="australian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24221719-5013404,00.html |title=Girth by sea: obesity costs Australia $58&amp;nbsp;billion a year |accessdate=5 July 2009 |author=Siobhain Ryan |date=22 August 2008 |work= |publisher=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the number of Australians with [[type 2 diabetes]] rose to nearly a million for the first time.&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt; In addition, the number of type 2 diabetes patients who were diagnosed solely on their weight was calculated at 242,000 in 2007, a 137% increase in cases in the previous three years.&lt;ref name="australian" /&gt;

In 2008 using the Body Mass Index scale, obese Australians (indirectly and directly) cost the nation $8.3 billion. Out of the $8.3 billion, $2.0 billion was the cost of the health system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Cost of overweight and obesity in Australia |first1=Stephen |last1=Colagiuri |first2=Crystal M Y |last2=Lee |first3=Ruth |last3=Colagiuri |first4=Dianna |last4=Magliano |first5=Jonathan E |last5=Shaw |first6=Paul Z |last6=Zimmet |first7=Ian D |last7=Caterson |display-authors=3 |date=1 March 2010 |journal=Medical Journal of Australia |doi= |accessdate=31 March 2015 |issue=5 |volume=192 |pages=260–4 |pmid=20201759 |url=https://www.mja.com.au/system/files/issues/192_05_010310/col10841_fm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government response==
In April 2008, the [[Government of Australia|Australian Federal Government]] added obesity to its list of "national health priorities", officially elevating it to the same standard of attention given to other deadly ailments such as [[cancer]], [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name="australian2" /&gt; On 1 June 2009, the first Parliamentary comment on obesity in Australia was published, with the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing recommending 20 acts for the Federal Government to consider, including tax incentives to make healthier fruits and vegetables more affordable for Australians, and pressing the government to work with the food industry to lower fat and sugar levels in existing processed food.&lt;ref name="parliament2"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/health-topics/obesity-and-overweight |title=Obesity in Australia Report - "Weighing It Up" }}&lt;/ref&gt; These recommendations covered a range of issues affecting obesity in Australia. The government agreed to the majority of the recommendations including to continue supporting the Active After-School communities program which lead more children to have more positive attitude towards physical activity and agreeing to develop consistent urban planning guidelines that focus on creating environments that encourage Australians to be healthy and active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/govt-response-obesity |title=Australian Government response to the House of Representatives standing committee on health and ageing report: weighing it up: obesity in Australia. |date=2013 |accessdate= |website= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] government under Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] wanted to tackle the obesity problem in Australia by giving tax subsidies which would fund gym memberships to people who wish to lose weight.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/news/subsidies-for-people-to-lose-weight-and-get-fit/story-e6frf00r-1225739827730 |title=Subsidies for people to lose weight and get fit |accessdate=5 July 2009 |author1=Sue Dunlevy |author2=Xanthe Kleinig |lastauthoramp=yes |date=25 June 2009 |work= |publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her watchdog group, the National Preventative Health Taskforce, also wants to target childhood obesity by banning ads for junk food during the daytime when most children's television programs air.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

In August 2008, the government of [[New South Wales]] announced that it would pay for morbidly obese patients to receive weight loss surgery, the first state to make such an announcement.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/health/state-to-pay-for-obesity-surgery/2008/08/02/1217097606084.html |title=State to pay for obesity surgery |accessdate=5 July 2009 |author=Louise Hall |date=3 August 2008 |work= |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Australians who wish to have such surgery have to go to a private hospital and pay for the procedure themselves, which costs $10,000 ($10,000 USD).&lt;ref name="smh" /&gt; A survey in [[Western Australia]] suggests that the number of patients who have undergone weight loss surgery has increased 20-fold in the past 20 years, with nine out of ten patients opting for the [[lap band]] procedure.&lt;ref name="theage2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.theage.com.au/national/obesity-surgery-numbers-skyrocket-study-20080817-3wwt.html |title=Obesity surgery numbers skyrocket: study |accessdate=5 July 2009 |date=17 August 2008 |work= |publisher=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to The Obesity Society Australia, if obesity rates continue to grow in Australia at this current rate over the next few decades, it is conceivable that the health and economic cost due to obesity will also grow to overwhelming portions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=To Time to Weight |date=March 2014 |journal=Obesity: A National Epidemic and its Impact on Australia |doi= |pmid= |url=http://www.obesityaustralia.org/resources-1/no-time-to-weight |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131074140/http://www.obesityaustralia.org/resources-1/no-time-to-weight |archivedate=31 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oregon Museum Tavern Shooting''' occurred on May 7, 1981, at Oregon Museum Tavern in [[Salem, Oregon]].

== Incident ==
Lawrence William Moore, 25, of [[Scio, Oregon]], an unemployed mill worker
walked into the crowded Oregon Museum Tavern on Front Street NE which was hosting a [[Ladies' night]] and without saying a word started to fire his 9mm Browning handgun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kval.com/news/local/32-years-later-oregon-bar-shooting-victim-dies|title=32 years later, Oregon bar shooting victim dies|first=JOCE DEWITT, Salem Statesman|last=Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore first fired at the bar, before turning the weapon at patrons who began to flee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Once the magazine had run out he reloaded and continued firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katu.com/news/local/30-years-later-sounds-of-gunfire-still-haunt-shooting-victim|title=30 years later, sounds of gunfire still haunt shooting victim|first=Bob Heye, KATU On Your Side Investigator and KATU.com|last=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the times he was reloading several patrons at the tavern overpowered him, wrestled him to ground and held him waiting of the police to arrive.

The killing spree ended with the killing 3 people at the scene and injuring 20 others; one of these died in hospital later that night, and Dennis Scharf died nearly 32 years later from injuries sustained.

== Fatalities ==
*Lori J. Cunningham, 22 – died at the scene
*John W. Cooper, 27 – died at the scene
*Robert E. Hamblin, 24 – died at the scene
*Allen L. Wilcox, 24 – died at hospital
*Dennis Scharf – died January 19, 2013 due to complications from injuries sustained

== Legal and aftermath ==
At trial, beginning on October 6, 1981, he pleaded innocent to the murder charges, citing mental disease or defect as a defense; however, he admitted to being the gunman.
Moore stated the reason for the shooting that he was trying to get members of a 'syndicate' of millionaires, Jews and criminals who had been trying to poison him.

Moore was subsequently found guilty of four counts of aggravated murder and sentenced to four life terms in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/third-court-of-appeals/1997/1301.html|title=Lawrence William Moore v.

[[File:PWA - Patients' Welfare Association logo.JPG|thumb|Patients' Welfare Association's Logo]] The '''Patients' Welfare Association''' ('''PWA''') is a non-political, non-governmental organization (NGO) located within [[Civil Hospital]], [[Karachi]] run by the students of [[Dow Medical College]], which works for the medical aid of underprivileged patients by providing a number of services free of charge. The organization depends upon its donors and volunteers for its functionality and maintenance. Other than conventional charity donations and [[zakat]] funds the PWA also holds many fund raising campaigns such as bake sales and promotion in school campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwa-chk.org |title=アコムでお金を借りる！【即日審査、振込…どうすれば可能？】 |website=Pwa-chk.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2005/07/06/local9.htm |title=KARACHI: ‘Bake Sale Mela’ held at CHK - Newspaper |website=Dawn.com |date=2005-07-06 |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/print1.asp?id=131875 |title=The News International: Latest News Breaking, Pakistan News |website=Thenews.com.pk |date=2017-06-09 |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Patients' Welfare Association was established as a small student based organization by three students of [[Dow Medical College]] in 1979,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pwa-chk1"/&gt; with simple services such as free of cost drugs for needy patients. In the years to come the organization gained much popularity and by 1982 it had gained enough funds and volunteer force to form a blood bank and a [[Thalassemia]] Follow-up Clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pwa-chk.org/blood%20bank.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606093710/http://www.pwa-chk.org/blood%20bank.html |archivedate=2009-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwa-chk.org/QASID2005_3.html ]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their influence spreading, in 1986 a diagnostic laboratory was set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pwa-chk.org/diagnostic%20lab.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608003353/http://www.pwa-chk.org/diagnostic%20lab.html |archivedate=2009-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pwa-chk2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pwa-chk.org/QASID2005_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061120/http://www.pwa-chk.org/QASID2005_1.html |archivedate=2009-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2002/06/27/local12.htm |title=KARACHI: PWA generates funds for poor patients : Fund-raising bake sale today - Newspaper |website=Dawn.com |date=2002-06-27 |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
With the slogan "''We feel, We serve''," their existence depends on service to the underprivileged segment of society. The organization achieves this by means of several departments which have been built within the vicinity of [[Civil Hospital]], [[Karachi]].

===Blood bank===
The Blood bank provides more than 350 units of blood daily on exchange basis not only to patients of Civil Hospital Karachi, but also extends its services to patients all over the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2007/11/06/local5.htm |title=KARACHI: LGH gynae section lacks staff, basic facilities - Newspaper |website=Dawn.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; All units dispatched are screened for [[Hepatitis B]], [[Hepatitis C]], [[HIV]], [[Syphilis]] and Malarial Parasite, thus ensuring patient safety. The blood bank also provides blood components such as packed cells, platelets and fresh frozen plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pwa-chk.org/bloodbank.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918135320/http://www.pwa-chk.org/bloodbank.php |archivedate=2011-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Blood Bank has also started the service of providing mega unit of platelets to patients of Civil Hospital Karachi, free of cost.

===Thalassemia Services===
Previously working under the 'Follow Up Clinics', PWA Thalassemia Services was upgraded to a separate department with the start of transfusion facility for registered Thalassemia patients in 2011. The department has got 260 registered patients suffering from Thalassemia, a hereditary blood disorder. These patients are receiving regular blood transfusions and consultations by a qualified Haematologist along with regular diagnostic investigations, Due to shortage of funds, only 60 registered patients are currently being provided with Iron chelation therapy. efforts are under-way to collect funds and start provision of Iron chelation therapy to all registered patients. The cost of treatment of one patients suffering from this lifelong disease is Pakistani Rs. 300,000 - Rs. 500,000 per annum depending upon the age and blood transfusion needs of the patient. PWA Thalassemia Services is providing all these facilities completely free of charge.

==Other events==
The Patients' Welfare Association holds many events; from fund raising activities to seminars concerning local medical issues. One of their main fund raising events is an annual ‘Food Mela', a bake sale of colossal magnitude, where funds more than one million rupees have been gathered in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2005/07/06/local9.htm |title=KARACHI: ‘Bake Sale Mela’ held at CHK - Newspaper |website=Dawn.com |date=2005-07-06 |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pwa-chk2"/&gt;

A '''preauricular sinus''' (also known as a '''congenital auricular fistula''', a '''congenital preauricular fistula''', a '''Geswein hole''',&lt;ref&gt;Geswein, a familial name of German descent,  is sometimes used to describe the anomaly of 'preauricular sinus (PAS)' because of the inherited condition known to accompany the Geswein family lineage; PASs are  furthermore inherited from the supernumerary and predecessing Smith family pedigree.

In medical terminology,  congenital physical anomalies often receive scientific names that honor a person. A taxon (e.g. species or genus; plural: taxa) named in honor of another entity is an eponymous taxon, and names specifically honoring a person or persons are known as patronyms. Scientific names are generally formally published in peer-reviewed journal articles or larger monographs along with descriptions of the named taxa and ways to distinguish them from other taxa.  

The term 'Geswein Hole' however,    adheres to none of the above criterion. 
&lt;/ref&gt; an '''ear pit''',&lt;ref name="Fitz2"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Irwin M | last1 = Freedberg | first2 = Thomas B | last2 = Fitzpatrick | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2003 | title = Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine | edition = 6th | publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn = 978-0-07-138076-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|782}} or a '''preauricular cyst'''&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rapini | first1 = Ronald P. | last2 = Bolognia | first2 = Jean L. | last3 = Jorizzo | first3 = Joseph L. | name-list-format = vanc | title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-1-4160-2999-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a common [[congenital malformation]] characterized by a nodule, dent or dimple located anywhere adjacent to the external [[ear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1118768-overview|title= Preauricular Sinuses | work = MedScape | access-date = 24 February 2009 | first1 = Noah S | last1 = Scheinfeld | first2 = Valerie | last2 = Nozad | name-list-format = vanc |date= 18 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequency of preauricular sinus differs depending the population: 0.1–0.9% in the US, 0.9% in the UK, and 4–10% in Asia and parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim HJ, Lee JH, Cho HS, Moon IS | title = A case of bilateral postauricular sinuses | journal = Korean Journal of Audiology | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–101 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 24653881 | pmc = 3936561 | doi = 10.7874/kja.2012.16.2.99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preauricular sinuses are inherited features, and most often appear [[laterality|unilaterally]]. They are present bilaterally in 25–50% of cases.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Presentation==

=== Complications ===
Occasionally a preauricular sinus or [[cyst]] can become [[Infection|infected]].&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = James | first1 = William D. | last2 = Berger | first2 = Timothy G. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 |oclc= |doi= |access-date=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most preauricular sinuses are asymptomatic, and remain untreated unless they become infected too often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Stephen | last1 = Ludwig | first2 = Stephan | last2 = Strobel | first3 = Stephen D. | last3 = Marks | first4 = Pete K. | last4 = Smith | first5 =  Magdi H. | last5 = El Habbal | first6 = Lewis | last6 = Spitz | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s8XdO4wM1QQC | title = Visual Handbook of Pediatrics and Child Health | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | date = 2008 | page = 517 | isbn =  978-0-7817-9505-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preauricular sinuses can be excised surgically, but often present a high risk of recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leopardi G, Chiarella G, Conti S, Cassandro E | title = Surgical treatment of recurring preauricular sinus: supra-auricular approach | journal = Acta Otorhinolaryngologica Italica | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 302–5 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19205595 | pmc = 2689545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Causes ==
Preauricular sinuses and cysts result from developmental defects of the first and second [[pharyngeal arches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/medical/preauricular_sinus.htm|title= Preauricular Sinus|access-date= 24 Feb 2009| work = Stedman's Medical Spellchecker | quote = cited in WrongDiagnosis.com|year= 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This and other congenital ear malformations are sometimes associated with renal anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang RY, Earl DL, Ruder RO, Graham JM | title = Syndromic ear anomalies and renal ultrasounds | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = E32 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11483842 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11483842 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In rare circumstances these pits may be seen in genetic conditions such as [[branchio-oto-renal syndrome]]; however these conditions are always concurrent with other health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Branchiootorenal syndrome | url = https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10147/branchiootorenal-syndrome | work = Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Courses of treatment typically include the following:{{fact|date=November 2016}}

* Draining the pus occasionally as it can build up a strong odor
* Antibiotics when infection occurs.
* Surgical excision is indicated with recurrent fistular infections, preferably after significant healing of the infection. In case of a persistent infection, infection drainage is performed during the excision operation. The operation is generally performed by an appropriately trained specialist surgeon e.g. an [[otolaryngologist]] or a specialist General Surgeon. 
* The fistula can be excised as a cosmetic operation even though no infection appeared. The procedure is considered an [[elective surgery|elective operation]] in the absence of any associated complications.

}}'''The Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF)''' is a joint U.S.-Japan research organization responsible for studying the medical effects of radiation and associated diseases in humans for the welfare of the survivors and all humankind.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Introduction to Radiation Effects Research Foundation. (1995).  Radiation Effects Research Foundation, pp.1-3. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://rerf.jp/shared/introd/introRERFe.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 26 Feb. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is located in Hiroshima, Japan.

The studies have been going on for 70 years, which makes RERF the only institution that has been conducting epidemiological studies on a population of more than 120,000 individuals for this long.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;A Brief Description. (2014). Radiation Effects Research Foundation, p.1. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://rerf.jp/shared/briefdescript/briefdescript_e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 26 Feb. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; RERF continues to conduct research until this day because the effects of A-bomb radiation on human health have not been fully elucidated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

RERF conducts research in multiple fields of science including epidemiology, clinical medicine, genetics, and immunology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Findings from RERF’s studies have been used not only for the medical care and welfare of the A-bomb survivors but also for the establishment of international radiation protection standards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
The preceding organization to RERF was the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission which was established in 1948 by the U.S National Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was established to determine how, over long-term, exposure to radiation affected the health of A-bomb survivors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An extensive interview survey was conducted in the 1950s, based on which records were compiled for each A-bomb survivor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These records concerned location and structure of the building the survivor may have been at the time of the bombing. Based on these records, radiation doses were calculated for most A-bomb survivors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

RERF was established on April 1, 1975, as a nonprofit foundation under the jurisdiction of the Japan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Health and Welfare.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On April 1, 2012, RERF transitioned to a public interest incorporated foundation upon authorization by Japan’s Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mothra.rerf.or.jp/|title=Radiation Effects Research Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Programs&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ==
RERF studies the effects of radiation on the survivors of the atomic bombings in Japan.

=== Life Span Study ===
This study gathers samples from the general population of both sexes and all ages. It is the most informative epidemiological study in the world, because of its long duration. It provides information about cancer incidence, cancer mortality and non-cancer effects on the survivors. RERF wants to continue the studies for complete lifetimes of the participants.

=== Adult Health Study ===
This is a clinical study of a sub-cohort of the Life Span Study, conducted every two years. It is investigating age and radiation-related physiological changes.

=== Children of Atomic-bomb Survivors Study ===
The study’s goal is to determine whether genetic effects may appear in the children of the atomic bomb survivors. RERF has observed no radiation effects in the study of birth defects, chromosome abnormalities, and serum proteins. Currently, molecular studies on DNA are being conducted.

=== In Utero Study ===
This study investigates the effects of radiation on the people who were in utero at the time of the bombing (about 3,600 persons).

=== Radiation Biology ===
Radiation biology studies seek to understand the result of physical phenomena involved in radiation response. The studies are directed to DNA indications that cause breast and thyroid cancer.

=== Immunology ===
This study focuses on the changes in the immune system of people exposed to atomic-bomb radiation.

=== Molecular Epidemiology ===
This is a newly emerging field of study at RERF, which investigates the radiation effects by looking at molecular changes in DNA. It is used to understand the mechanisms and causes of disease better.

=== Cytogenetics ===
Cytogenetics helps assess radiation exposure (biological dosimetry) by evaluating the structural damage in chromosomes.

=== Statistics ===
This study assesses the risks through the application of mathematical models to rates of disease occurrence or death to identify radiation effects. The statisticians also take part in other studies done at RERF to develop better methods for analysis of data.

=== Atomic-bomb Dosimetry ===
This study provides survivors with radiation exposure dose estimates, based on the knowledge of physics and sensitive measurements that detect minute traces of the atomic bomb radiation in various materials. The information is also combined with historical interview data.

== Facilities ==
RERF has 2 facilities: one based in Hiroshima and one in Nagasaki.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Raymond Pearl''' (3 June 1879 – 17 November 1940) was an American [[biologist]], regarded as one of the founders of [[biogerontology]]. He spent most of his career at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]]. Pearl was a prolific writer of academic books, papers and articles, as well as a committed populariser and communicator of [[science]]. At his death, 841 publications were listed against his name.

==Early life==

Pearl was born into an upper-middle class in [[Farmington, New Hampshire]] on June 3, 1879.  At an early age, Pearl was exposed to the classics.  His parents and grandparents wanted him to study Greek and Latin.  However, when he attended [[Dartmouth College]] at 16 years old, he became fascinated by biology and graduated with a B.A. as the youngest in his class.  At Dartmouth, he was known to be an exceptional student as well as a skilled musician.  He was capable of playing almost every wind instrument, and he planned amateur music performances with his friends and colleagues.  In 1899, Pearl attended the [[University of Michigan]] where he received his PhD in [[zoology]] for his work on the behavior of planarians.  He also was involved in studying the variation of fish for the Biological Survey of the [[Great Lakes]].  While working in a zoological laboratory, he met his future wife, Maude M. De Witt.  In 1903, they married, and together in 1905 and 1906, they traveled abroad and worked at the [[University of London]], [[University of Leipzig]], and Marine Biological Station in Naples.&lt;ref name=Goldman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldman|first1=I.L.|title=Raymond Pearl, smoking and longevity|journal=Genetics|date=November 1, 2002|volume=162|issue=3|pages=997–1001|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/162/3/997.short|pmid=12454050|pmc=1462343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, he spent a year studying under [[Karl Pearson]] at University College, London. During this year he discovered [[biometry]], which seemed to offer a solution to the problems he was concerned with in biology, zoology and [[eugenics]]. On his return to the US he continued his interests, but was converted from biometry to [[Mendelian genetics]].

==Career==

Pearl’s interest in statistical methods in biology began at the University of London, where he worked alongside Karl Pearson.  He stayed as an instructor at the University of Michigan until 1906, and that same year, he went to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to be an instructor in zoology.  A year later, he became the head of the Department of Biology of the Main Agricultural Experiment Station at the [[University of Maine]] in Orono where he studied the genetics of poultry and other domestic animals.  From 1917 to 1919, Pearl was the Chief of the Statistical Division of the [[United States Food Administration]].  In 1918, Pearl developed a department of laboratory statistics when he was recruited by Johns Hopkins University to be the Professor of Biometry and Vital Statistics.&lt;ref name=Goldman /&gt;

In 1920 he was elected as a [[Fellow]] of the [[American Statistical Association]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm List of ASA Fellows], retrieved 2016-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
which he also served as president.

==Wilson's attack==

In 1929, Pearl’s friend [[William Morton Wheeler]] was about to retire as the Dean of the Bussey Institution at [[Harvard University]].  At this time, there were plans to alter the current biological departments and create a field of human biology at Harvard.  Due to his connections at Harvard, Pearl was mentioned as a possible candidate to succeed Wheeler and had many supporters there.  However, [[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]], a Harvard mathematician, was a critic of Pearl and did not believe he was fit for this position.  Wilson believed that great detail and attention should be used when dealing with the math of biological data and thought that Pearl had been messy with his handling and reasoning of math in the field of biology.  Wilson’s first issue with Pearl was his study of population growth in the 1920s.  Pearl stated that he discovered the law of population that represented an S-shaped curve of growth, but Wilson thought that his data was insufficient and did not support this assertion.&lt;ref name=Kingsland&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kingsland|first1=Sharon|title=Raymond Pearl: On the Frontier in the 1920's: Raymond Pearl Memorial Lecture, 1983|journal=Human Biology|date=February 1984|volume=56|issue=1|pages=1–18|jstor=41463546|pmid=6378756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his criticism of Pearl, in 1925, Wilson reached out to Pearl for help on his cancer research.  Pearl was unaware of Wilson’s criticism of him at the time.  He did not help Wilson because he thought that he did not have a sufficient understanding of the biological and medical fields, which further ignited Wilson's distaste of Pearl.  In 1929, Pearl conducted research on the correlation between tuberculosis and cancer and published a paper that claimed that there is a negative correlation.  This research had mistakes in its data analysis, so Wilson saw this study as an opportunity to attack Pearl and prevent him from becoming the new dean.  Wilson denounced Pearl’s use of mathematics in the cancer study to different departments at Harvard and published about it as well.  His efforts paid off as the Board of Overseers at Harvard rejected Pearl’s nomination by a vote of ten to nine.  Pearl continued his scientific pursuits at Hopkins until his death.&lt;ref name=Kingsland /&gt;

==Eugenics, medicine, and politics==

Pearl was a eugenicist who held traditional [[Francis Galton|Galtonian]] beliefs.  He wanted to use eugenics and biometry in medicine and public health in order to gain knowledge of human heredity.&lt;ref name=Comfort&gt;{{cite book|last1=Comfort|first1=Nathaniel|title=The Science of Human Perfection: How Genes Became the Heart of American Medicine|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven &amp; London|pages=67–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearl founded the Constitutional Clinic at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]].  He believed in constitutional medicine, which focuses on examining the soil on which a seed falls.  He later became the director of a new Institute of Biological Research at Johns Hopkins in 1925 that was aimed at examining the genetics and environmental factors of disease.  This research institute combined biometry, genetics, and medicine to investigate the hereditary predisposition of [[tuberculosis]] and [[hypertension]].  When conducting his research of these diseases, Pearl recorded the height, weight, handedness, measurements of different body parts, and physical descriptions.  Just like Galton, he believed that race was an important factor in human characteristics and believed in using biology and genetics to improve the long-term health of the population.  Although he tried to be quantitative, objective, and systematic, his classifications of different races were influenced by social norms and prejudices.&lt;ref name=Comfort /&gt;

However, in the late 1920s, Pearl condemned eugenics.  Pearl criticized the use of race in eugenics despite conducting research that recognized racial differences.  He believed that eugenics was doing the right thing badly and that human biology was eugenics done right if it consisted of reliable statistics, objectivity, a liberal social agenda, and medical affiliations.&lt;ref name=Comfort/&gt; In 1927, he published the landmark article ''The Biology of Superiority'', which attacked the basic assumptions of eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 12 | pages = 257–266 | last = Pearl | first = Raymond | title = The biology of superiority | journal = American Mercury | year = 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article was the first general attack on eugenics by someone perceived as being within the movement.&lt;ref name=allan&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-27560-6 | pages = 169‒202 | editors = Hugo Tristram Engelhardt and Arthur Leonard Caplan (eds.) | last = Allen | first = Garland E. | title = Scientific controversies: case studies in the resolution and closure of disputes in science and technology | chapter = The role of experts in scientific controversy | location = Cambridge ; New York | year = 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also contributed to the emergence of reform eugenics and the [[population control]] movement. Pearl was an influential member of the Advisory Committee of the [[World Population Conference]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanger|first=Margaret|title=Proceedings of the World Population Conference|year=1927|publisher=Edward Arnold &amp; Co.|location=London|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MyRBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22proceedings+of+the+world+population+conference%22&amp;dq=%22proceedings+of+the+world+population+conference%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  after which Pearl helped found the [[International Union for the Scientific Study of Population Problems]].&lt;ref name="allan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ludmerer &gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ludmerer | first1 = K. M. | title = American geneticists and the eugenics movement: 1905–1935 | doi = 10.1007/BF00125023 | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 337–362 | year = 1969 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his apparent rejection of eugenics, Pearl maintained relatively good relations with key eugenicists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-534878-1 | last = Kühl | first = Stefan | title = The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism | location = Oxford | date = 2002-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed classist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = U of Minnesota Press | isbn = 978-0-8166-3558-0 | last = Ordover | first = Nancy | title = American Eugenics: Race, Queer Anatomy, and the Science of Nationalism | year = 2003 | page = 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made statements which have been interpreted as being [[anti-Semitic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-45875-7 | last = Barkan | first = Elazar | title = The Retreat of Scientific Racism: Changing Concepts of Race in Britain and the United States Between the World Wars | date = 1993-09-16 | page = 216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1927-1932, Pearl and his colleague Alan Meyer were important figures of one of the first birth control clinics in the United States called Baltimore’s Bureau for Contraceptive Advice.  Pearl was a supporter of birth control, but had a more conservative and scientific approach when compared to the ideologies of [[Margaret Sanger]].  The clinic performed a eugenic medicine study that looked at how the distribution of birth control information that was provided by a clinic affected society.&lt;ref name=Comfort/&gt;

==Scientific interests==

Pearl's main focus of interest was in biostatistics.  As one of the first biostatisticians to use mathematics as a way to interpret population genetics, Pearl published a book called ''Modes of Research in Genetics'' in 1915 and another book called ''Introduction to Medical Biometry and Statistics'' in 1923.  They were both widely read and were influential in showing the importance of statistics in the genetic and medical fields.&lt;ref name=Goldman /&gt;

Even though many of his books were well-received, some of his beliefs still caused controversy.  One such belief was that when a brother and sister reproduce, there would not be an increase in homozygosity.  Pearl believed that with brother-sister breeding and no selection past the F3 generation, heterozygosity would not fall below 50%.&lt;ref name=Goldman /&gt;

Even though his main interest was biostatistics, Pearl had a wide range of interests in biology and was known for his broad knowledge of the subject.  He published works on animal behavior, population growth, food and prices, Jewish and Christian marriages, and vegetarianism.  In the 1920s and 1930s, Pearl focused on the effect that the environment, which included disease, alcohol, and tobacco, has on longevity.  He published a book called ''Alcohol and Longevity'' in 1926, where he claimed that moderate consumption of alcohol could be beneficial for cardiovascular health, which was met with much debate due to prohibition.  Controversy continued when Pearl conducted a study on tobacco in which he demonstrated that smoking decreases longevity while drinking does not.&lt;ref name=Goldman /&gt;

Pearl is regarded as one of founders of [[Gerontology#Biogerontology|biogerontology]]. In 1908 Max Rubner observed that mammals of different size and [[longevity]] had equal [[mass]] specific [[metabolism|metabolic]] output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Max | last=Rubner |  year=1908 | title=Das Problem der Lebensdauer und seine Beziehungen zum Wachstum und Ernahrung |  publisher=Oldenbourg | location=Munich, Germany}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly based on the observation that the longevity of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] varies inversely with ambient temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Loeb, Jaques and Northrop,J.H. | title=On the influence of food and temperature upon the duration of life | journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume=32 | issue=1 | date=1 October 1917| pages=103–121 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/32/1/103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl (like Rubner) also asserted that [[maximum life span]] is inversely proportional to [[basal metabolic rate]]. Pearl accepted [[Alexis Carrel]]'s erroneous ideas that normal [[somatic cell]]s don't age, and that aging must therefore be due to dysfunction at the body level. Pearl speculated that lifespan was limited by vital cell components that were depleted or damaged more rapidly in animals with faster metabolisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Raymond | last=Pearl |  year=1928 | title=The Rate of Living, Being an Account of Some Experimental Studies on the Biology of Life Duration |  publisher=Alfred A. Knopf | location=New York}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denham Harman]]'s [[free-radical theory|free-radical theory of aging]] later provided a plausible causal mechanism for Pearl's hypothesis.

The ''Rate of Living Hypothesis'' enjoyed prominence as one of the foremost [[Senescence#Theories of aging|theories of aging]] for nearly 50 years. The ''Rate of Living Hypothesis'' is undermined by the observation that a [[rat]] and a [[bat]] have similar metabolic rate, but a bat lives several times longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Brunet-Rossinni AK, Austad SN |title=Ageing studies on bats: a review |journal=Biogerontology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=211–22 |year=2004 |pmid=15314271 |doi=10.1023/B:BGEN.0000038022.65024.d8}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, further doubts have been raised on the ''Rate of Living Hypothesis'' by the demonstration that, when modern statistical methods for correcting for the effects of body size and phylogeny are employed, metabolic rate does not correlate with longevity in mammals or birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=de Magalhães JP, Costa J, Church GM |title=An analysis of the relationship between metabolism, developmental schedules, and longevity using phylogenetic independent contrasts |journal=The Journals of Gerontology.

==Social habits and death==
Pearl was widely known for his lust for life and his love of food, drink, music and parties.&lt;ref name=kingsland&gt;{{Cite journal

Mencken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-983927-8 | last = Rodgers | first = Marion Elizabeth | title = Mencken:The American Iconoclast | date = 2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Springer New York | isbn = 978-1-4614-3648-5| pages = 129–141 | editors = Alan Agresti (ed.) | last = Meng | first = Xiao-Li | author2 = Charles Rohde| author3 = Scott L.

Raymond Pearl is, also, known for his population biology work, as in his 1928 volume, ''The Rate of Living: Being an Account of Some Experimental Studies on the Biology of Life Duration.''   In this book, he presents extensive research regarding population density effects on life duration in fruit flies, demonstrating that an optimal population density existed for that insect in his experimental model.  This raised the question of whether or not the same effect might not occur in other species, including humans.  His work demonstrating longer lifespans for flies with lower metabolic rates, also, raised the question of whether or not a similar phenomenon might be found in other species, including humans.  Thus, he became a mentor to John B. Calhoun, famous for his ecological studies of rodent populations and their possible importance for modern humans.  Population density effects on duration of life is thought, by population biologists, to be Raymond Pearl's greatest contribution to biological science.

In November 1940, Pearl was in apparently good health and paid a visit to the [[Baltimore Zoo]]. He cut his trip short complaining of chest pains and died later that day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11053">'''Roman Igorevich Tsepov''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Роман Игоревич Цепов, (July 22, 1962, [[Kolpino, Saint Petersburg|Kolpino]], [[Leningrad Oblast]], [[USSR]] – September 24, 2004, [[Saint-Petersburg]]) was a [[Saint Petersburg]] [[businessman]] and [[confidant]] to [[Vladimir Putin]] during Putin's work at the [[Saint Petersburg City Administration]]. Born Belinson, Tsepov changed his [[surname]] upon marriage to Tsepova. Tsepov was suspected of criminal and corruption activity.

== Biography ==
Upon graduation from the Supreme Political school of the [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs|Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR]], Tsepov served in the [[Internal Troops]] as a [[political commissar]]. In 1990, he retired from the Ministry of Internal Affairs at the rank of [[Captain (land and air)|captain]].

== "Baltik-Eskort" ==
In 1992, Tsepov founded the security firm "Baltik-Eskort". The idea to create this agency belonged to the future Putin's bodyguard [[Viktor Zolotov]] who later oversaw this agency as a member of the [[Active reserve (KGB)|active reserve]].&lt;ref name="Assassins"&gt;[[Yuri Felshtinsky]] and [[Vladimir Pribylovsky]] ''The Age of Assassins. The Rise and Rise of Vladimir Putin'', Gibson Square Books, London, 2008, {{ISBN|1-906142-07-6}}, pages 260-262.&lt;/ref&gt;  The firm provided protection to high ranking Saint Petersburg officials, including the city mayor [[Anatoly Sobchak]] and his family, as well as the vice-mayor [[Vladimir Putin]]. In this role, Tsepov also acted as an "intermediary between Putin and business". At the same time, "Baltik-Eskort" rendered security services to a number of criminal leaders, in particular Aleksandr Malyshev, the leader of "Malyshev's gang" and his family and several figures of the [[Tambov Gang]].&lt;ref name=gurin&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2368580 Roman Tsepov, R.I.P] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155103/http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2368580 |date=2007-09-30 }} by Charles Gurin, [[Eurasia Daily Monitor]] #93, September 27, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminal activity ==
In 1994, Tsepov was arrested on charges of illegal storage of weapons and drugs. It is rumored that the real reason for arrest was gathering of "protection" money to secure [[gambling]] licenses from city office of Vladimir Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mn.ru/issue.php?2004-37-14 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828033102/http://www.mn.ru/issue.php?2004-37-14 |archivedate=2006-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stringer&gt;http://www.stringer.ru/publication.mhtml?Part=0&amp;PubID=1269&lt;/ref&gt;

His name appears in several criminal investigations, the last one being in March 1998 on charges of [[extortion]] of 70 thousand dollars [http://www.mk-piter.ru/2004/09/29/026/][http://www.apn-spb.ru/publications/print359.htm].

== Prominent businessmen ==
Upon Vladimir Putin's coming to power, Tsepov became one of the most influential figures in the financial and political life of Saint Petersburg. He took part in the [[First inauguration of Vladimir Putin|first presidential inaugural ceremony]] of Vladimir Putin. Tsepov's power and influence were attributed to his close association with then Minister of Internal Affairs [[Rashid Nurgaliyev]], the chief of [[Presidential Security Service]] [[Viktor Zolotov]] (Zolotov attended Tsepov's funeral&lt;ref name=Polonium&gt;[http://www.newspb.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=561 Николай АНДРУЩЕНКО.

== Death by poisoning ==
On 11 September 2004, Tsepov visited colleagues at a local [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] office where he had a cup of tea. On the same day, he felt unwell after which a very serious disease developed with symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea and sudden drop of white blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/06/alexander-litvinenko-and-the-most-radioactive-towel-in-history|title=Alexander Litvinenko and the most radioactive towel in history|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=2016-03-06|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Treated in Hospital 31 in Saint Petersburg, he died on 24 September. A [[Autopsy|postmortem]] investigation found a poisoning by an unspecified [[radioactive material]]. He had symptoms similar to [[Aleksander Litvinenko]].&lt;ref name=Polonium/&gt;&lt;ref name=Svoboda/&gt;&lt;ref name=timesonline&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2484298,00.html The Putin bodyguard riddle], [[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]], December 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trivia ==
After playing a small part in [[Vladimir Bortko]]'s [[mini-series]] ''[[Banditskiy Peterburg: Advokat]]'' (2000) Tsepov co-produced the [[Vladimir Bortko]]'s [[mini-series]] ''[[My Honor]]'' (2004). The series was awarded a [[TEFI]], the highest television award in [[Russia]], as best film.

The '''Réveillon riots''' occurred between 26–29 April 1789&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safarix.com/0131930370/app02lev1sec1 SafariX Textbooks Online – SafariX is now CourseSmart&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309160745/http://www.safarix.com/0131930370/app02lev1sec1 |date=9 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; centered in the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine|St. Antoine]] district of Paris where a factory which produced luxury wallpaper was owned by [[Jean-Baptiste Réveillon]]. The factory employed around 300 people. The riots were one of the first instances of [[violence]] during the [[French Revolution]]. The factory where the riot took place was unusual in pre-revolutionary France as the factory was [[guild]]-free in an era where guilds controlled quality standards. 

Protests began after rumors spread that the owner had made a speech stating that workers, many of whom were highly skilled, were to be paid lower wages and, as a result, there would be lower prices. Workers were concerned with food shortages, high unemployment, and low wages after a difficult winter in 1789. However, Réveillon was known for his benevolence towards the poor and actually stated that bread prices should be brought down to those that people could afford (below 15 [[Solidus (coin)|sous]] a day) but his comments were misinterpreted as wage restrictions. He made the comments on 21 April when the assembly of the Saint-Marguerite was discussing its [[Cahiers de doléances|''Cahier'']] which all Estates drew up before the Estates-General was to be called. 

After informal protests on Sunday 26 April, groups of protesters congregated on the Ile de la Cité and in the [[Faubourg Saint-Marcel]], Marais, and Faubourg Saint-Antoine the next day for a series of protest-marches. Though the first three marches - one of which targeted the Third Estate's Assembly of Electors - were resolved peacefully, confrontations between troops and participants in the fourth demonstration led to the outbreak of violence in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine that evening. 

While the protesters did not manage to destroy the factory as it was being guarded by a group of around fifty troops, a factory owned by the [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] manufacturer Henriot was destroyed after he made similar comments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.periclespress.com/France.html&lt;/ref&gt; However Réveillon’s factory was destroyed a day later as was his home&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.otal.umd.edu/~msites/frchron89-90.html Chronology of the French Revolution: 1789–1790&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517224141/http://www.otal.umd.edu/~msites/frchron89-90.html |date=17 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The riot killed 25 people&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and wounded around the same number although rumour caused the casualty figures to be exaggerated. The [[Gardes Françaises|French Guard]] were used to restore order.

Ourian was born in Iran and moved the [[Los Angeles]] in the 1980s with his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Anil Bhoyrul |title=A cut above: Dr Simon Ourian, cosmetic surgeon to the stars |url=https://www.arabianbusiness.com/style/399676-abe-1925-cut-above-the-rest |publisher=[[Arabian Business]] |accessdate=2 July 2018 |date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His inclination towards cosmetic dermatology started at a young age when he saw the effect of plastic surgery on movie actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Kathleen Hale |title=Is Teenage Plastic Surgery a Feminist Act? |url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a9555312/teenage-plastic-surgery-feminism/ |publisher=[[Harper's Bazaar]] |accessdate=28 June 2018 |date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his undergraduate degree in the field of [[molecular biology]] from the [[California State University]], Northridge, and his medical degree from [[Wayne State University]] in Michigan. Ourian did his residency at UCLA.&lt;ref name="mogul"/&gt;

He is married to Sharon Naim Ourian.

==Professional experience==
After completing his education, Ourian started his own practice. He worked on his techniques and tested non-invasive procedures on himself. Ourian worked with the Fibonacci sequence to study facial elements and patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Meet cosmetic surgeon to the Kardashians, Dr Simon Ourian |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/life-style/entertainment/2017/10/30/EXCLUSIVE-Meet-cosmetic-surgeon-to-the-Kardashians-Dr-Simon-Ourian-.html |publisher=[[Al Arabiya]] |accessdate=28 June 2018 |date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1998, he founded the Epione Beverly Hills. He developed Coolaser for clearing acne and discoloration for darken skin tone and Coolbeam to get rid of stretch marks. He also created my Vibrata, a tool for minimizing pain, which is used by doctors around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Bhavna Anna Guyadeen |title=The Modern-Day Sculptor - An Interview with the Surgeon To The Stars |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/590c6966e4b056aa2363d3e5 |publisher=[[HuffPost]] |accessdate=28 June 2018 |date=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ourian uses various laser technology and non-invasive aesthetic procedures for the correction or reversal of a variety of conditions.

===Coolaser===
Ourian developed the Coolaser technology, and it has been used by celebrities such as [[Olivia Culpo]] and Kim Kardashian. It involves cooling the treatment area with a special device that emits a series of light pulses across the surface of the skin to stimulate cell repair and collagen growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Alex Warner |title=Olivia Culpo Just Showed Us The Trick Behind Her Insanely Glowy Skin |url=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a19563557/olivia-culpo-coolaser-skin-treatment/ |publisher=[[Marie Claire]] |accessdate=28 June 2018 |date=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Cristina Gibson |title=Jenna Dewan Tatum Shares Low-Makeup Selfie, Reveals How She Got Rid of Melasma |url=https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/jenna-dewan-tatum-reveals-how-she-got-rid-of-melasma/ |publisher=[[Us Weekly]] |accessdate=28 June 2018 |date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sleep–wake activity inventory''' ('''SWAI''') is a subjective multidimensional questionnaire intended to measure sleepiness.

==The instrument==
The SWAI consists of 59 items that provide six subscale scores: excessive daytime sleepiness, nocturnal sleep, ability to relax, energy level, social desirability, and psychic distress.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal et al."&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rosenthal L. |author2=Roehrs T.A. |author3=Roth T  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1993 |title=The sleep-wake activity inventory: a self-report measure of daytime sleepiness |journal=Biol Psychiatry |pmid=8292685 |volume=34 |issue=11 |pages=810–820 |doi=10.1016/0006-3223(93)90070-T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each item is rated on a 1 to 9 semicontinuous Likert type scale from "always" to "never", based on the previous seven days.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal et al."/&gt; The SWAI was normed on 554 subjects in the early 1990s and is currently being validated or has been validated in multiple languages, including Spanish, French and Dutch.

For the ''excessive daytime sleepiness'' subscale (SWAI-EDS), a score of 40 or below indicates excessive sleepiness, a score of between 40 and 50 indicates possible sleepiness and a score of greater than 50 is normal.

A short form of the SWAI exists that contains items for the ''excessive daytime sleepiness'' and ''nocturnal sleep'' subscales only.

==Comparison with other sleepiness assessments==
The SWAI has been compared to the [[multiple sleep latency test]] (MSLT), which is an objective measure that is considered the gold standard of sleepiness assessment; it measures [[sleep onset latency]] during several daytime opportunities. The SWAI-EDS has been found to correlate moderately to highly with average MSLT scores.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal et al."/&gt;

Other sleepiness scales, including the [[Stanford sleepiness scale]] and the [[Epworth sleepiness scale]] (ESS), exist. However, the ESS does not correlate as highly with the MSLT as the SWAI.&lt;ref name="Chervin et al."&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chervin R.D. |author2=Aldrich M.S. |year=1999 |title=The Epworth sleepiness scale may not reflect objective measures of sleepiness or sleep apnea |journal=Neurology |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=125–131 |doi=10.1159/000023448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESS is currently the most prevalent measure of excessive sleepiness.

==History==
The SWAI was developed by Drs. Leon Rosenthal, Timothy Roehrs and Tom Roth at the Sleep Disorders and Research Center at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan.

The media used was a purple color to illustrate the resulting pattern, normally a transparent media would be used.]]

A '''spiral plater''' is an instrument used to dispense a liquid sample onto a [[Petri dish]] in a [[spiral]] pattern. Commonly used as part of a [[Colony-forming unit|CFU]] count procedure for the purpose of determining the number of microbes in the sample.&lt;ref name="initial article"&gt;J. E. Gilchrist, J. E. Campbell, C. B. Donnelly, J. T. Peeler, and J. M. Delaney  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4632851 "Spiral Plate Method for Bacterial Determination"],  ''[[Appl Microbiol. ]]'', 1973 February; 25(2): 244–252., {{PMC|380780}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this setting, after spiral plating, the Petri dish is incubated for several hours after which the number of colony forming microbes (CFU) is determined. Spiral platers are also used for research, clinical diagnostics and as a method for covering a Petri dish with [[bacteria]] before placing antibiotic discs for [[Antibiotic sensitivity|AST]].

== Mode of action ==
The spiral plater rotates the dish while simultaneously dispensing the liquid and either [[linear motion|linearly moving]] the dish or the dispensing tip. This creates the common spiral pattern. If all movements are done in constant speed, the spiral created would have a lower concentration on the outside of the plate than on the inside. More advanced spiral platers provide different options for spiral patterns such as constant concentration (by slowing down the spinning and / or the lateral movements) or exponential concentration (by speeding up the spinning and / or the lateral movements).

== In food and cosmetic testing ==
Spiral plating is used extensively for microbiological testing of food, milk and milk products and cosmetics. It is an approved method by the FDA.&lt;ref name="fda bam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/LaboratoryMethods/ucm063346.htm |title=BAM: Aerobic Plate Count |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of spiral plating is less plates used versus plating manually because different concentrations are present on each plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/magazine-archive1/junejuly-2011/advances-in-spiral-plating-increase-reproducibility-and-cost-savings/ |title=Advances in Spiral Plating Increase Reproducibility and Cost Savings |publisher=Food Safety Magazine |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="initial article"/&gt; This also makes it harder to count the colonies and requires special techniques and equipment.&lt;ref name="fda bam"/&gt;

== Stand-alone vs. Add-on ==
Spiral platers are either available as stand-alone instruments that are fed manually with plates and samples or fed automatically using dedicated stackers. Alternatively spiral platers are available as integrated devices as part of larger automated platforms. In this case a larger workflow is often automated, e.g. plating, [[Incubator (culture)|incubation]] and [[Colony counter|counting]].

{{Nihongo|'''Tatsudaryō Incident'''|龍田寮事件|Tatsudaryō jiken}} or  {{Nihongo|'''Kurokamikō Incident'''|黒髪校事件|Kurokamikō jiken}} occurred in 1954, when children of leprosy patients were denied public schooling because  parents of the public school children [[leprosy stigma|feared their children might contract leprosy]].
&lt;!---preserve name of school---
was an incident in which pupils born of leprosy patients were denied schooling at the Kurokami Primary School in 1954 because of [[leprosy stigma]].---&gt;This became national news. The issues were the right of children to attend public school despite their parents illness, the right of the general public to avoid contagion, the accuracy of the predictions made by the medical community, and the rights of the local community over national control of education.

==Background==
When leprosy sanatoriums were constructed in 1909, the question arose concerning the care of children born to leprosy patients. In the [[Kyushu]] Sanatorium, now the [[Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium]], healthy, non-resident relatives of the family were directed to care for the children of leprosy patients. Another option was to allow the Tairo-in Sanatorium, or [[Tairoin Hospital]] take care of the children with funding provided by the leprosy prevention association.&lt;ref&gt;Kikuchi Keifuen[1960:67]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a sample list of fees for children boarded out.

===Residence for children===
In 1935, Keifūen Home&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium&lt;/ref&gt; was constructed within the campus of Kyushu Sanatorium by the Leprosy Prevention Association for the children of patients with leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;Jichikai[2006:158]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, the Kaishun Byōin, a leper hospital established by [[Hannah Riddell]] was disbanded. To replace it, Tatsuda Ryo (dormitory) was constructed with 19,800 yen donated by the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Keifuen[1960:68]&lt;/ref&gt; Those patients in the Keifuen Home were transferred to the Tatsuda Ryo.

A school was created within the dormitory.  There was one teacher. Education was limited. Patients' children of high school and junior high school age were attending local public schools, but primary school-age students were not.

In 1942,　the Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium insisted that Kumamoto City should integrate the primary school students, as well. While the city officials agreed, the public school officials declined.&lt;ref&gt;City Education Committee[1994:504]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Proposal of Matsuki Miyazaki===
[[Matsuki Miyazaki]] was a physician, leprosy specialist, and Director of the Kyushu Sanitorium. In December 1953, he met with the principal of the Kurokami Primary School to ask him to consider admitting children of leprosy patients. He requested an answer by April 1954.

The school principal said he would agree if their [[Parent Teacher Association]] (PTA) would agree. Ryunosuke Seguchi was president of the PTA. He was a physician and chairman of the Kyushu Prefectural Assembly. Seguchi said that the problem should be handled cautiously but offered no definitive answer. Miyazaki then sent a formal request to the Kumamoto District Legal Affairs Bureau asking that discrimination in schooling should be halted.&lt;ref&gt;City Education Committee[1994:505]&lt;/ref&gt; Seguchi publicly disagreed with this request. The issue became national news.

==The Incident==

===Authorities confront the local PTA===
On December 9, 1953, there was an annual meeting of the PTA of the Kurokami Primary School. Participants included Miyazaki, Seguchi, members of the city educational committee, and local representatives of the city.

A questionnaire had been sent out to parents. The results of the questionnaire were made public. Those in favor of schooling were 420 (34%), against schooling were 795 (64%) and 14 (2%) were neutral.&lt;ref&gt;City Education Committee[1994:506]&lt;/ref&gt; The Kumamoto District Legal Affairs Bureau expressed the opinion that 1) In four other leprosy sanatoriums, there had been no trouble integrating students without infection. 2) Tadao Toda, a Professor of Bacteriology at [[Kyushu University]] and Professor [[Kentaro Higuchi]], a Professor of Dermatology, Kyushu University had expressed the view that non-infected students infecting other pupils with leprosy was inconceivable.

The three ministries of Japan &lt;ref&gt;The names of the ministries are those at that time&lt;/ref&gt; of Education, [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Justice]] and [[Ministry of Health and Welfare (Japan)|Welfare]] expressed the view that denial of schooling would be illegal. The Ministry of Welfare stated that proper health maintenance could not lead to the infection of leprosy. The ministry of education thought that pupils should attend the school without discrimination, since there was no possibility of infection. The Ministry of Justice stated that the pupils should attend the school.

On March 1, the following policy was established by the Kumamoto District Legal Affairs Bureau that 1) the city education committee should ensure that the pupils attend the public school starting April 1, 1954;  2) the Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium should give more strict health maintenance to the pupils. The meeting was attended by the Legal Affairs Bureau staff, the city education committee members and the Kikuchi Keifuen staff.&lt;ref&gt;City Education Committee[1994:507]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Opposition Movement started===
On March 1, 1954, the citizens of the Kurokami Primary School held a meeting on the school grounds. Protestors claimed that although the pupils in the Tatsuda Ryo were said to be not infected, five pupils had been isolated. The protestors did not believe that there was no danger of infection. They were not convinced of the method of treatment.

The rate of developing leprosy among pupils was 0.7%. Based on that statistic, the protestors felt that they could not endanger their 1,800 students.  On March 10, Okamoto, the chairman of the city education committee stated at the city assembly that they had reached the conclusion that the pupils should attend the school. This was broadcast on the radio the following day.  Members of the PTA intensified their opposition. On March 12, they announced that they would stage a strike.

Some of the members of PTA stated that they would favor integration if a third party would guarantee that the prospective attendees had not been infected.&lt;ref&gt;Kikuchi Keifuen[1960:69]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, a health examination of the four pupils, under question, was conducted at the Department of Dermatology, Kumamoto University. This revealed that the pupils were not infected.  On April 7, the city education committee declared that the pupils would attend the school. Dissatisfied, the opposition members went on strike April 8. They displayed a large poster that pupils should not go to school with pupils with leprosy. Initially the strike was a success. Only four pupils attended the school with a kindergarten teacher. 76 pupils went to school out of 1928 registered. On the 5th day, 312 pupils attended the school. The opposition movement side started a type of [[Terakoya]] education, namely unofficial private schools at 17 sites.　On April 27, there was another examination of the four pupils under question at the Department of Dermatology, Kumamoto University. They announced that one girl needed further examination.&lt;ref&gt;Kikuchi Keifuen[1960:69]&lt;/ref&gt; This strengthened the opposition movement. Because of the conflict, the principal of the school retired and Toko Kozaki assumed the post of the principal on May 1.&lt;ref&gt;City Education Committee[1994:513]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The opposition strengthens===
On June 15, 1954, the opposition movement requested the abolishment of the Tatsuda Dormitory. A conflict started between the two lobbyist groups. Japanese [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Education Minister]] Oodate heard from both sides when he visited Kumamoto on October 7.&lt;ref&gt;City Education Committee[1994:516]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group who favored integration of primary students stated that the attitude of the Kurokami Primary School was deplorable, since graduating primary students go from the Tatsuda Ryo to local secondary schools and high schools. Miyazaki said that the prevention of leprosy was a national policy. Children born of leprosy patients live in the Tatsuda Ryo in order not to infect children. The problem should be solved from the standpoint of equal right of education. In other parts of Japan, children born of leprosy patients were welcomed.

The opposition said that they heard the explanation from Dr. Miyazaki, but it was pressure from the law and science. They had heard that three persons had developed leprosy from the Tatsuda Ryo. In the case of Sakurayama High School, they admitted a student secretly. The president of the PTA said that enlightenment should come first; if the local inhabitants became convinced. Otherwise, the children cannot feel safe.

Meetings of both sides were frequently held in the small community. When the city education committee sent a letter allowing the children to go to school, three members of the opposition movement went on a hunger strike before the city education committee.&lt;ref&gt;City Education Committee[1994:520]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediation===
The hunger strike continued over 155 hours when it was stopped by the mediation of Morio Takahashi, the President of the Kumamoto College of Commerce. He would take care of the questioned children (one boy and two girls) at his house and let them go to the school.&lt;ref&gt;City Education Committee[1994:521]&lt;/ref&gt;

A commencement ceremony took place on April 18, 1955. The children went to school accompanied by a female teacher of another school. The incident appeared to be solved but the school had taken special precautions. The children were encircled by classmates of the pro-schooling movement and special attention was given to school lunch. Starting in the fall of 1955, the children of the Tatsuda Ryo were secretly sent to various institutions and homes and relatives. In October 1957, the Tatsuda Ryo was formally abolished.&lt;ref&gt;City Education Committee[1994:525]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tidal Model'''&lt;ref name="tidalbook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barker |first=P. |author2=Buchanan-Barker P.  |title=The Tidal Model: A Guide for Mental Health Professionals |publisher=Brunner-Routledge |year=2005 |location=London |isbn=1-58391-801-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theoristbook1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brookes |first=Nancy |title=Nursing Theorists and Their Work |editor=Marriner-Tomey, M |editor2=Allgood, A |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2006 |edition=6 |pages=696–725 |chapter=Phil Barker: Tidal Model of Mental Health Recovery |isbn=978-0-323-03010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[recovery model]] for the promotion of [[mental health]] developed by Professor Phil Barker, Poppy Buchanan-Barker and their colleagues. The Tidal Model focuses on the continuous process of change inherent in all people. It seeks to reveal the meaning of people's experiences, emphasising the importance of their own voice and wisdom through the power of [[metaphor]]. It aims to empower people to lead their own recovery rather than being directed by professionals.&lt;ref name="theoristbook2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barkway |first=Patricia |title=Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing |editor=Elder, R. |editor2=Evans, K. |editor3=Nizette, D. |publisher=Mosby |year=2009 |edition=2 |pages=119–134 |chapter= Theories on Mental Health and Nursing |isbn=978-0-7295-3877-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy underpinning the model initially was inspired by a five year research into what people need for care in mental health carried out by Prof. Barker and Dr. Chris Stevenson at the [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne|University of Newcastle]], [[UK]].&lt;ref name="evaluation"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevenson |first=C. |author2=Barker, P. |author3=Fletcher, E. |year=2002 |title=Judgement days: developing an evaluation for an innovative nursing model |journal=Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing |volume=9 |pages= 271–276 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2850.2002.00472.x |pmid=12060370 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, it has been put into practice in a number of settings in the UK and abroad.&lt;ref name="tidal"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barker P. |title=The Tidal Commitments: extending the value base of mental health recovery |journal=Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing |year=2008 |volume=15 |pages=93–100 |pmid=18211556 |last2=Barker |first2=PJ |issue=2 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2850.2007.01209.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the work of Phil Barker in this area, he is frequently cited as being a prominent contemporary theorist in [[psychiatric and mental health nursing|mental health nursing]].&lt;ref name="theoristbook1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theoristbook2"/&gt;

==Six key philosophical assumptions==
The tidal model is applied through six key philosophical assumptions:&lt;ref name="tidal"/&gt;
* a belief in the virtue of curiosity
* recognition of the power of resourcefulness, rather than focusing on problems, deficits or weaknesses
* respect for the person's wishes, rather than being paternalistic
* acceptance of the paradox of crisis as opportunity
* acknowledging that all goals must belong to the person
* the virtue of pursuing elegance—the simplest possible means should be sought

==The engagement process==
In order for the practitioner to begin the process of engagement using the Tidal Model, the following needs to be accepted:
* that recovery is possible
* that change is inevitable—nothing lasts
* that ultimately, people know what is best for them
* that the person possesses all the resources they need to begin the recovery journey
* that the person is the teacher and the helpers are the pupils
* that the helper needs to be creatively curious, to learn what needs to be done to help the person

The process of engaging with the person in distress takes place in three discrete domains.&lt;ref name="tidalbook"/&gt; With the Tidal Model, the practitioner explores these dimensions to be aware of the situation in the ''present'' time and determine what needs to happen ''now''.

* '''Self domain''' is where people feel their world of experience. There is an emphasis on making people feel more secure and the practitioner helps the person develop a ''Security Plan'' to reduce threats to the person or others around them.
* '''World domain''' is where people hold their story. The Tidal Model practitioner uses a specific form of inquiry to explore this story collaboratively, revealing its hidden meanings, the person's resources, and to identify what needs to be done to assist recovery.
* '''Others domain''' represents the various relationships the person has: past, present and future. This includes Tidal Model practitioners but also other members of the health and social care team, friends, family and supporters.

==The power of metaphor==
The Tidal Model uses the metaphor of [[water]] and describes how people in distress can become [[emotion]]ally, [[human physiology|physically]] and [[spirituality|spiritually]] ''shipwrecked''.&lt;ref name="tidalbook"/&gt; It sees the experience of [[health]] and [[illness]] as a ''fluid, rather than a stable phenomenon'', and life as a journey undertaken on an ''ocean of experience''. It proposes that in mental health, the factors associated with a [[psychiatric]] [[crisis]], or its more enduring consequences, can be diverse as well as cumulative. It states that by appreciating this metaphor, nurses or other helpers will gain a greater understanding of the person's current situation and the inevitability of change. With this, the helper may, in time, be guided to ''care with'' the person beginning their journey from the state of being ''washed ashore'', ''drowning'' or being otherwise ''marooned'' by their life problems. Following the rescue, exploration can then begin as to what caused the ''storm'' in the first place and what needs to be done immediately to ''set sail'' again.

==The Ten Commitments==
The values of the Tidal Model can be distilled into Ten Commitments.&lt;ref name="tidalbook"/&gt;
# '''Value the voice''' – the person's story is paramount
# '''Respect the language''' – allow people to use their own language
# '''Develop genuine curiosity''' – show interest in the person's story
# '''Become the apprentice''' – learn from the person you are helping
# '''Reveal personal wisdom''' – people are experts in their own story
# '''Be transparent''' – both the person and the helper, Professionals are in a privileged position and should model confidence, by at all times being transparent and helping to ensure the person understand exactly what is being done &lt;ref&gt;Barker 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''Use the available toolkit''' – the person's story contains valuable information as to what works and what doesn't
# '''Craft the step beyond''' – the helper and the person work together to construct an appreciation of what needs to be done "now"
# '''Give the gift of time''' – time is the midwife of change. The question that should be asked is, "How do we use this time?".&lt;ref&gt;Barker P., Barker P. B., 2005 The Tidal Model: A guide for Mental Health Professionals. New York: Brunner- Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Know that change is constant''' – this is a common experience for all people

===The Twenty Competencies===
The Twenty Competencies were introduced to assist with the auditing of recovery practice by generating practice-based evidence for the model. They focus on competencies in practice and there are two related to each of the commitments above.&lt;ref name="tidal"/&gt;

==The model in practice==
In 2000, the Tidal Model was first implemented in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK in the adult mental health programme covering nine acute admission wards. Almost 100 different Tidal Model projects were established in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, Japan and Australia.&lt;ref name="tidal"/&gt; However, it has yet to be broadly adopted.

A '''toilet plume''' is the dispersal of microscopic particles as a result of [[flush toilet|flushing a toilet]].  The term refers to both the contamination of nearby surfaces through droplets ejected from the toilet, and the formation of smaller, dry particles that stay in the air for long periods, although the former appears to be of more concern.

While there is indirect evidence that aerosols containing pathogens could potentially be spread by a toilet [[Plume (fluid dynamics)|plume]], as of 2013 no direct experimental studies had clearly demonstrated or refuted actual disease transmission from toilet aerosols, and the risk had not been well characterized.  It has been hypothesized that dispersal of pathogens may be reduced by closing the [[Toilet seat|toilet lid]] before flushing, and by using toilets with lower flush energy.

== Possible effects on disease transmission ==

Some other pathogens speculatively identified as being of potential concern for these reasons include [[Gram-positive bacteria|gram-positive]] [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', and the [[pandemic H1N1/09 virus]] commonly known as "swine flu".&lt;ref name="Mead2013" /&gt;

There is no direct experimental evidence on disease transmission by toilet aerosols.  Whether or not aerosols can contain norovirus, SARS coronavirus, or other pathogens has not been directly measured as of 2015.&lt;ref name="Mead2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jon2015" /&gt;  The combination of cleaning and [[Disinfectant|disinfecting]] surfaces is usually effective at removing contamination, although some pathogens such as norovirus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=J.|last2=Vipond|first2=I.

Experiments to test bioaerosol production usually involve seeding a toilet with [[bacteria]] or [[virus]] particles,&lt;ref name="Mead2013" /&gt; or fluorescent microparticles,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and then testing for their presence on nearby surfaces and in the air after varying amounts of time.&lt;ref name="Mead2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The amount of bioaerosol varies with the type of flush toilet.

&lt;!-- Side effects and mechanism --&gt;
[[Side effect]]s of trengestone include [[headache]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and [[breast tenderness]] among others.&lt;ref name="HorskyPresl2012" /&gt; Trengestone is a progestin, or a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[progestogen]], and hence is an [[agonist]] of the [[progesterone receptor]], the [[biological target]] of progestogens like [[progesterone]].&lt;ref name="HorskyPresl2012" /&gt; It is not [[androgen]]ic or [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]ic.&lt;ref name="HorskyPresl2012" /&gt;

&lt;!-- History, society, and culture --&gt;
Trengestone was introduced for medical use in 1974.&lt;ref name="Brudon1983" /&gt; It is no longer available.&lt;ref name="Micromedex" /&gt;

==Medical uses==
Trengestone was used in the treatment of [[menstrual disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="Micromedex" /&gt; It has also been used to [[ovulation induction|induce ovulation]], with about a 50% success rate on average.&lt;ref name="HorskyPresl2012" /&gt;

[[Side effect]]s of trengestone include [[headache]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and [[breast tenderness]] among others.&lt;ref name="HorskyPresl2012" /&gt; It is not [[androgen]]ic and does not cause [[virilization|masculinization]].&lt;ref name="HorskyPresl2012" /&gt;

==Pharmacology==
[[File:20α-Dihydrotrengestone.svg|thumb|left|225px|[[20α-Dihydrotrengestone]], the main [[active metabolite|active form]] of trengestone.]]

===Pharmacodynamics===
Trengestone is a [[progestogen]], or an [[agonist]] of the [[progesterone receptor]].&lt;ref name="HorskyPresl2012" /&gt; It is an atypical progestogen similarly to [[dydrogesterone]].&lt;ref name="HorskyPresl2012" /&gt; For instance, unlike other progestogens, trengestone and dydrogesterone do not increase [[body temperature]] (i.e., have no [[hyperthermia|hyperthermic]] effect).&lt;ref name="HorskyPresl2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid679688"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taubert HD | title = Luteal phase insufficiency | journal = Contrib Gynecol Obstet | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 78–113 | date = 1978 | pmid = 679688 | doi = | url = | quote = Fig. 17.

One tablet per day is administered from the 5th [...] Both dydrogesterone and trengestone can inhibit ovulation in the rat and rabbit, but only the latter compound can do so in women — at doses far above the therapeutic range. Various clinical reports have suggested, on the basis of quite unrelated findings, that trengestone may, despite lack of inherent estrogenicity, somehow cause an indirect stimulation of the production of endogenous estrogens. Numerous investigators (Stamm et al., 1968; Dapunt and Windbichler, 1970) have satisfied themselves that the compound may stimulate ovulation in women with certain endocrinologic imbalances or deficiencies [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to dydrogesterone and [[progesterone (medication)|progesterone]], trengestone has no [[androgen]]ic or [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]ic activity.&lt;ref name="HorskyPresl2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16112947" /&gt;

The Office of Refugee Resettlement took over the supervision of unaccompanied minors in 2003. In the first nine years of its operations, it was charged with fewer than 8,000 children per year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Office of Refugee Resettlement, [https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/orr/orr_fact_sheet_on_unaccompanied_alien_childrens_services_0.pdf Fact Sheet: Unaccompanied Alien Children Program], June 15, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of apprehended UAC doubled from 2009 to 2013.&lt;ref name=AgeBreakdown&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/BPC%20Immigration%20Task%20Force%20-%20Child%20Migration%20by%20the%20Numbers%20June%202014.pdf |title=Child Migration by the Numbers |website=[[BipartianPolicy.Org]] |date=June 2014 |quote=The number of UAC apprehended doubled between FY 2009 and FY 2013 and is on pace to nearly double again by the end of FY 2014.&lt;br&gt;..&lt;br&gt;In FY 2013, 24 percent of arriving children were 14 or younger, compared with 10 to 15 percent in FY 2007 and FY 2008.&lt;br&gt;..&lt;br&gt;Based on case file data obtained from ORR, the Vera Institute of Justice reported that in FY 2009 and FY 2010, 41 percent of children under age 14 were either 13 or 14 and about 59 percent were 12 or younger.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the [[Obama administration]] classified UAC influx as an urgent situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/02/presidential-memorandum-response-influx-unaccompanied-alien-children-acr |title=Presidential Memorandum – Response to the Influx of Unaccompanied Alien Children Across the Southwest Border |date=2 June 2014 |website=[[archives.gov]] |quote=The influx of unaccompanied alien children (UAC) across the southwest border of the United States has resulted in an urgent humanitarian situation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They then wait, in government-run facilities, for weeks or months while agency officials search for relatives or sponsors to care for the child while their immigration case is pending.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vitiligo Research Foundation''' (VRF) is a New York-based [[501(c)3]] non-profit organization focused on the skin disease [[Vitiligo]].&lt;ref&gt;vrfoundation.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Vitiligo Research Foundation was founded in 2010 by Russian entrepreneur Dmitry Aksenov, whose daughter suffers from vitiligo, after he found that there was a lack of quality research into the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitton|first1=ME|title=Interventions for vitiligo.|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|date=Jan 20, 2010|pmid=20091542|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003263.pub4|pages=CD003263|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25710794|date = November 2018}}

The VRF is managed by a small team of permanent staff. They are assisted by a Board of Directors chaired by Professor Torello Lotti (Professor of the Dermatology Division at [[Marconi University|University of Rome “Guglielmo Marconi”]]. A Scientific Advisory Board advises on scientific issues, while a Public Advisory Board that includes members such as reporter and author [[Lee Thomas (reporter)|Lee Thomas]], advises on aspects of living with vitiligo and how best to support those affected by the condition. The members of all three Boards are volunteers.

The VRF receives no funding from government or the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and is entirely reliant on public donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tax forms|url=https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/452498489 or download directly (http://vrfoundation.org/system/resources/BAhbBlsHOgZmSSJBMjAxNC8wOS8xMi8wMl81Nl80NV81NjVfVlJfRm91bmRhdGlvbl9Gb3JtXzk5MF9ZZWFyXzIwMTMucGRmBjoGRVQ/VR_Foundation_Form_990-Year_2013.pdf)|website=vrfoundation.org|publisher=US Tax Dept.|accessdate=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main initiatives==
Initiatives instigated and/or supported by the VRF:

===Vitiligo BioBank===
The Vitiligo [[Biobank|BioBank]] is a federated network of biobanks in nine different countries that store [[genetic material]] and [[health records]] from both vitiligo patients and their unaffected relatives. All participating biobanks share common [[Standard Operating Procedures]], as well as a standardized [[data set]] (Vitiligo Patient Record) developed by the VRF. Bio samples are collected and stored locally, while accompanying anonymous clinical records are stored in the Vitiligo CloudBank.

===Vitiligo CloudBank===
The Vitiligo Cloudbank is a secure online system that holds information on vitiligo patients from across the world. This includes vitiligo patient records, laboratory analysis data and, in some cases, associated genomic data. In 2014, the VRF also invited patients to use CloudBank as a personal vitiligo health record while participating anonymously in collaborative research.

===World Vitiligo Day===
The VRF sponsors and promotes June 25 as [[World Vitiligo Day]] – a date where people across the world come together to increase awareness of vitiligo, fight prejudice and raise funds for research, support and education. Signatures are currently being collected through 25June.org to petition the [[UN Secretary General]] to officially designate the date as World Vitiligo Day.

===World Vitiligo Map===
The World Vitiligo Map is an international directory that provides global information on vitiligo research centers, patient support groups and healthcare providers experienced in treating vitiligo and supporting sufferers. It is free to use and, in general, the medical professionals who appear in the directory are not affiliated with the VRF.

===Vitiligo Crowdfunding===
In late 2014, the VRF introduced an innovative approach to [[research funding]] by setting up a [[crowdfunding]] scheme for selected research projects. This allows supporters to donate directly to vitiligo research projects and programs that are typically too small to apply for a grant but too big to be funded directly from the VRF budget.
