'''Albert Kahn Associates''' is an architectural design firm in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] with a second office located in Miami, Florida. It was established in 1895 and is still active today. Recent work includes being awarded third place in the [https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/3DPHab/five-teams-win-a-share-of-100000-in-virtual-modeling-stage Virtual Modeling Stage of NASA’s 3D-Printed Habitat Competition] (as of July 2018) for their work on martian habitats, and also creating the world's largest penguin conservation center, [https://penguins.detroitzoo.org/ Polk Penguin Conservation Center]. In earlier years, It introduced a new technology in industrial building involving a unique reinforced concrete method referred to as the [[Kahn System]] of construction using proprietary patented reinforcement steel manufactured by [[Trussed Concrete Steel Company]]. The building of automobile factories and other types of factories were revolutionized from wooden [[timber framing]] construction. Besides being an advanced technology in strength that led to wider open interior spaces, it featured a high degree of fire resistance and larger window space for light. The firm started by [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]] built factories for Chrysler for over a decade, Ford Automobile for 30 years and Packard Automobile for 35 years. Other important clients of the firm were Republic Steel and General Motors. The firm was awarded a $40 million contract to build a tractor factory in Russia in 1928. The firm's output was over a million dollars worth of work per week by 1929. By 1939, the firm designed 19 percent of all industrial buildings in the United States and had designed some $800&amp;nbsp;million of buildings worldwide.{{sfn|Nelson|1939|pp=15-18}} 

==History==
[[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]] established the Detroit firm in 1895 and was its first and only employee then.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=24}} In 1896, Kahn took on two partners: George Nettleton and Alexander Trowbridge.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=30}} All three were architects at the time with the architectural firm [[George D. Mason|Mason &amp; Rice]] in Detroit. The firm they opened in January 1896 was initially called "Nettleton, Kahn, and Trowbridge".{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=30}} At the time there was an abundance of design jobs available. Mason &amp; Rice even referred some of their work to Kahn's new firm when they had more than they could handle.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=40}}

The firm's first large design job in Detroit was to design [[Children's Hospital of Michigan|Children's Hospital]] of Michigan.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=40}} Its next major project came in 1898 from [[James E. Scripps]] to design an elaborate library with an art gallery. The Scripps Library and Museum was located adjacent to Scripps' mansion home on Trumbull Avenue at Grand River Avenue.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=41}} The dynamics of the firm changed when Trowbridge took a position at Cornell University in 1897 and Nettleton died in 1900. The firm then hired designers with good reputations and an ability to work as a team with other designers. Ernest Wilby, a young Englishman from Canada, was their key designer working for the firm at the time.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=151}} This new team then collaborated with the Mason &amp; Rice architectural firm to design the [[Palms Apartments]], a building with English architecture on Jefferson Avenue at Rivard Street in Detroit. It was one of the first buildings to use [[reinforced concrete]] as a major construction material.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=42}}

The firm changed its name in 1901 to "Albert Kahn, architect; Ernest Wilby, associate",{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=43}} and had its first industrial design the same year. [[Joseph Boyer]] had hired the firm to design a factory that made [[pneumatic tool]]s.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=45}} Boyer then asked the firm to design a building to house the Burroughs Adding Machine Company, where modern mechanical calculators were made.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=45}} Boyer in 1902 introduced Kahn to [[Henry Bourne Joy|Henry Joy]], head of the [[Packard Motor Car]] company.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/ca/ca3300/ca3339/data/ca3339data.pdf |title=Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park, Ford Assembly Plant No. CA-326-H |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1968 |website=Library of Congress Prints &amp; Photographs Online |publisher=Historic American Engineering Record, National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior |accessdate=2014-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810130804/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/ca/ca3300/ca3339/data/ca3339data.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahn's firm received several non-industrial jobs from Joy, including remodeling Joy's home.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie/&gt;{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}} Joy additionally had the firm design automobile factory buildings.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie/&gt;{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}}

Between 1903–05, the firm designed the first nine [[Packard Automotive Plant|Packard Automotive Plant buildings]] using traditional wooden designs that had spans no longer than {{convert|14|ft|m|1}}.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|pp=28-29}} Packard produced over 700 automobiles a year by 1905, so an expansion to the factory facility was in order. The team decided to use reinforced concrete to build the new factory space.{{sfn|Atlas|1907|p=131}} With Albert's younger brother [[Julius Kahn (inventor)|Julius]] as the key architect and engineer, Building Number 10 was constructed with the [[Kahn System|Kahn bar]] and other [[Hy-Rib|reinforced concrete products]]. These were manufactured at the Trussed Concrete Steel Company (aka "Truscon"), which provided {{convert|32|ft|m|1|adj=on}} spans.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}}&lt;ref name=SedlarReport&gt;{{cite web |url= http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/98436/Sedlar_Engineering_Industrial_Architecture.pdf?sequence=1 |title= Engineering Industrial Architecture / The Trussed Concrete Steel Company and Albert Kahn|last1=Sedlar  |first1=Frank |last2= |first2= |date=April 23, 2013 |website=U of M Library |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=2014-07-30}} "The Packard #10 building was the first to utilize reinforced concrete with Julius Kahn's Kahn Bar but also as previously discussed, the full range of steel building products from the Trussed Concrete Steel Company."&lt;/ref&gt; This new technology for concrete changed the way American automobile factories were built.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie/&gt;{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}} This building was built with uniquely designed steel beam reinforced concrete for reinforcement that used the Kahn bar with winged tabs on the steel bar edges that were bent back at 45 degrees to resist and counter tension stresses.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}}&lt;ref name=SedlarReport/&gt;{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=29}} This was the first time reinforced concrete was used for automobile factory construction in the United States.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}}{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=31 "Thus Plant Number Ten represented a clear advance in factory construction for Packard and for the automobile industry in general, as it was the first automobile plant to be built of reinforced concrete"}}{{sfn|Nelson|1939|p=17 "The Packard job was the first reinforced concrete factory in America, and for the first time an industrialist got a plant in which fenestration was reasonably adequate and production departments were coordinated with an eye to efficiency'"}} The new [[state of the art]] design concept featured larger open interior spaces than the old mill-framed wooden factory buildings.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=51}} The building was 322 feet long by 60 feet wide (about 98 meters by 18 meters).{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=33}} This new factory concept of building with reinforced concrete lead to Albert Kahn Associates doing all the aviation factories for the government during World War I.{{sfn|Nelson|1939|p=17 ''By the time America entered the war the office was large enough to take over all of the government's aviation work''}}

In 1906, the firm designed factory buildings for the [[Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company]] in [[Buffalo, New York]].{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=37-49}} In 1908 the [[Highland Park Ford Plant]] was designed by the firm.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=37}} It was similar to the Packard factory just a few miles away, however different from the Pierce-Arrow factory buildings that were of one-story only and had saw-tooth roofs with [[skylights]]. The Ford factory building had four stories.
It was however, of reinforced concrete design using the patented Kahn System of his brother Julius, just like the Packard and Pierce-Arrow factory buildings. The Ford plant was 860 feet long and 75 feet wide.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie/&gt; The steel reinforced concrete building designs were fireproof.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie/&gt; The "Model factory" featured what was referred to as Truscon's "Daylight System" because of the many large windows.{{sfn|Skinner|1997|p=15}}

Henry Ford had the firm design his [[River Rouge Plant|River Rouge automobile factory]] that started construction in 1917.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=50}} At the time Ford decided to make a ship factory for the United States Navy and had the firm design B Building.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=50}} This was called the Eagle Plant because it built [[Eagle Boats]] that were antisubmarine chasers that destroyed German submarines.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=59}} It was 100 feet (30 meters) high by 300 feet (91 meters) wide by 1700 feet (518 meters) long.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=50}} When World War I ended this factory plant was converted to make Ford automobiles.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=59}}

The firm designed over 50 factories between 1921 and 1929 and had a substantial quantity of work not related to industrial buildings. It had over 400 on the staff by 1930 and was producing a million dollars worth of construction a week.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=126}} The firm never hired an architectural college graduate until 1935.&lt;ref name=NPS_Rosie/&gt;{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=126}} Going into the twenty-first century the firm name is Albert Kahn Associates and has branches in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], and [[São Paulo|São Paulo, Brasil]].&lt;ref name=KahnWebsite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albertkahn.com/where.php |title=About Kahn:Where |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2014|website=Albert Kahn, family of companies  |publisher=Albert Kahn Associates |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm designed about two thousand structures between 1895 and 1945 of which twenty-six were buildings for the University of Michigan.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=24, 151}}

== Organizational layout ==

The firm had a staff of 300–400 people in the 1930s, including about 40 secretaries, stenographers, typists, and file clerks. There were around 175 architectural designers and draftsmen, 80–90 mechanical and electrical engineers, 40–50 field superintendents, and about 30 specification writers.{{sfn|Nelson|1939|p=19}} The chief administrator was Albert Kahn and his assistants were his brothers Julius, Moritz and Louis.{{sfn|Nelson|1939|p=21}}  The staff was increased to 600 people at the time of World War II. The firm ramped up for war plants to make tanks and other war related equipment.{{sfn|Ferry|1970|p=25}}

[[File:Kahn firm layout 1939.jpg|1000px|center|Albert Kahn Associates firm layout in 1939]] 
The Technical Division had departments that designed the projects which included electrical, plumbing, heating and air-conditioning.
This division was responsible for the functional design of the building. Key important design elements for factories included  "straight-line" production capability, flexibility in interior floor designs to accommodate various changing production methods, generous column spacing to give maximum open floor space, high ceilings, strong floors to carry heavy loads, and with good lighting and ventilation.{{sfn|Nelson|1939|pp=19, 20, 24}}

The Executive Division was responsible for the management of the projects. Business-like management was required for concerns of economics, speed, obtaining reliable sub-contractors, adequate supervision, and complete accurate drawings.{{sfn|Nelson|1939|pp=20, 21, 24}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11880">The '''Alternative models to the Standard Higgs Model''' are models which are considered by many [[particle physics|particle physicists]] to solve some of [[Higgs boson]]'s existing problems. Two of the most currently researched models are [[quantum triviality]], and [[Hierarchy problem|Higgs hierarchy problem]].

==Overview ==
{{See also|Introduction to the Higgs field}}
In [[particle physics]], [[elementary particle]]s and forces give rise to the world around us. Physicists explain the behaviors of these particles and how they interact using the [[Standard Model]]—a widely accepted framework believed to explain most of the world we see around us.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Nick, ''[http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/european-technology/the-cern-tech-that-helped-track-down-the-god-particle/815?tag=nl.e101/ The Cern tech that helped track down the God particle]'', TechRepublic, July 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, when these models were being developed and tested, it seemed that the mathematics behind those models, which were satisfactory in areas already tested, would also forbid elementary particles from having any [[mass]], which showed clearly that these initial models were incomplete. [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers|In 1964 three groups of physicists almost simultaneously released papers]] describing how masses could be given to these particles, using approaches known as [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry breaking]]. This approach allowed the particles to obtain a mass, without breaking other parts of particle physics theory that were already believed reasonably correct. This idea became known as the [[Higgs mechanism]], and later experiments{{which|date=February 2016}} confirmed that such a mechanism does exist—but they could not show exactly ''how'' it happens.

The simplest theory for how this effect takes place in nature, and the theory that became incorporated into the Standard Model, was that if one or more of a particular kind of "[[field (physics)|field]]" (known as a [[Higgs field]]) happened to permeate space, and if it could interact with elementary particles in a particular way, then this would give rise to a Higgs mechanism in nature. In the basic Standard Model there is one field and one related Higgs boson; in some extensions to the Standard Model there are multiple fields and multiple Higgs bosons.

In the years since the Higgs field and boson were proposed as a way to explain the origins of symmetry breaking, several alternatives have been proposed that suggest how a symmetry breaking mechanism could occur without requiring a Higgs field to exist. Models which do not include a Higgs field or a Higgs boson are known as Higgsless models. In these models, strongly interacting dynamics rather than an additional (Higgs) field produce the non-zero [[vacuum expectation value]] that breaks electroweak symmetry.

'''''Bountiful Harvest''''' is a book by [[University of Houston]] economics professor [[Thomas R. DeGregori]], debunking what he calls "[[antiscience|anti-science]] [[environmental activist]]s", and arguing for the employment modern agricultural innovations such as [[genetically modified organism|bioengineered food]]s, which he claims have increased life expectancy and crop yields, and generally improved human well-being.

The ''[[AgBiotech Reporter]]'' called DeGregori's book "an ideal handbook for anyone who wants to understand the opponents of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/cgi-bin/Web_store/web_store.cgi?page%3Dbountifulharvest.html%26cart_id%3D |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2002-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021201001315/http://cato.org/cgi-bin/Web_store/web_store.cgi?page=bountifulharvest.html&amp;cart_id= |archivedate=2002-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71489">Cell [[microencapsulation]] technology involves [[Immobilized whole cell|immobilization]] of the cells within a [[polymeric]] [[semi-permeable membrane]] that permits the bidirectional [[diffusion]] of molecules such as the influx of oxygen, nutrients, [[growth factor]]s etc. essential for cell [[metabolism]] and the outward diffusion of waste products and [[therapeutic effect|therapeutic]] proteins.  At the same time, the semi-permeable nature of the membrane prevents immune cells and [[antibodies]] from destroying the encapsulated cells regarding them as foreign invaders.

The main motive of '''cell encapsulation''' technology is to overcome the existing problem of graft rejection in tissue engineering applications and thus reduce the need for long-term use of [[immunosuppressive drugs]] after an [[organ transplant]] to control side effects.

== History ==
In 1933 Vincenzo Bisceglie made the first attempt to encapsulate cells in polymer membranes. He demonstrated that [[tumor]] cells in a polymer structure transplanted into pig [[abdominal]] cavity remained viable for a long period without being rejected by the [[immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bisceglie V |title=Uber die antineoplastische Immunität; heterologe Einpflanzung von Tumoren in Hühner-embryonen |journal=Zeitschrift für Krebsforschung |volume=40 |pages=122–140 |year=1993 |url= |doi=10.1007/bf01636399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty years later in 1964, the idea of encapsulating cells within ultra thin polymer membrane microcapsules so as to provide immunoprotection to the cells was then proposed by [[Thomas Chang]] who introduced the term "[[artificial cell]]s" to define this concept of bioencapsulation.&lt;ref name="pmid14190240"/&gt; He suggested that these artificial cells produced by a drop method not only protected the encapsulated cells from immunorejection but also provided a high surface-to-volume relationship enabling good mass transfer of oxygen and nutrients.&lt;ref name="pmid14190240"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chang TM |title=Semipermeable microcapsules |journal=Science |volume=146 |issue= 3643|pages=524–5 |date=October 1964 |pmid=14190240 |doi= 10.1126/science.146.3643.524|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Twenty years later, this approach was successfully put into practice in small animal models when alginate-polylysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules immobilizing xenograft [[Islets of Langerhans|islet]] cells were developed.&lt;ref name="pmid6776628"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lim F, Sun AM |title=Microencapsulated islets as bioartificial endocrine pancreas |journal=Science |volume=210 |issue=4472 |pages=908–10 |date=November 1980 |pmid=6776628 |doi= 10.1126/science.6776628|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study demonstrated that when these microencapsulated islets were implanted into [[diabetic]] rats, the cells remained viable and controlled [[glucose]] levels for several weeks.

== Cell microencapsulation as a tool for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine ==

Questions could arise as to why the technique of encapsulation of cells is even required when therapeutic products could just be injected at the site. An important reason for this is that the encapsulated cells would provide a source of sustained continuous release of therapeutic products for longer durations at the site of implantation. Another advantage of cell microencapsulation technology is that it allows the loading of non-human and genetically modified cells into the polymer matrix when the availability of donor cells is limited.&lt;ref name="pmid18789985"/&gt; Microencapsulation is a valuable technique for local, regional and oral delivery of therapeutic products as it can be implanted into numerous tissue types and organs. For prolonged [[drug delivery]] to the treatment site, implantation of these drug loaded  artificial cells would be more cost effective in comparison to direct drug delivery. Moreover, the prospect of implanting artificial cells with similar chemical composition in several patients irrespective of their leukocyte antigen could again allow reduction in costs.&lt;ref name="pmid18789985"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murua A, Portero A, Orive G, Hernández RM, de Castro M, Pedraz JL |title=Cell microencapsulation technology: towards clinical application |journal=J Control Release |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=76–83 |date=December 2008 |pmid=18789985 |doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.08.010 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key parameters of cell microencapsulation technology ==

The potential of using cell microencapsulation in successful clinical applications can be realized only if several requirements encountered during the development process are optimized such as the use of an appropriate [[biocompatible]] polymer to form the mechanically and chemically stable semi-permeable matrix, production of uniformly sized microcapsules, use of an appropriate immune-compatible polycations cross-linked to the encapsulation polymer to stabilized the capsules, selection of a suitable cell type depending on the situation.

=== Biomaterials ===

The use of the best biomaterial depending on the application is crucial in the development of drug delivery systems and tissue engineering. The polymer [[alginate]] is very commonly used due to its early discovery, easy availability and low cost but other materials such as cellulose sulphate, [[collagen]], [[chitosan]], [[gelatin]] and [[agarose]] have also been employed.

==== Alginate ====
Several groups have extensively studied several natural and synthetic polymers with the goal of developing the most suitable biomaterial for cell microencapsulation.&lt;ref name="pmid15763258"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sakai S, Kawabata K, Ono T, Ijima H, Kawakami K |title=Development of mammalian cell-enclosing subsieve-size agarose capsules (&lt;100 microm) for cell therapy |journal=Biomaterials |volume=26 |issue=23 |pages=4786–92 |date=August 2005 |pmid=15763258 |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.11.043 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15532084"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cellesi F, Weber W, Fussenegger M, Hubbell JA, Tirelli N |title=Towards a fully synthetic substitute of alginate: optimization of a thermal gelation/chemical cross-linking scheme ("tandem" gelation) for the production of beads and liquid-core capsules |journal=Biotechnol.

Even ultrapure alginates may contain [[endotoxin]]s, and [[polyphenol]]s which could compromise the biocompatibility of the resultant cell microcapsules.&lt;ref name="pmid16574222"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orive G, Tam SK, Pedraz JL, Hallé JP |title=Biocompatibility of alginate-poly-l-lysine microcapsules for cell therapy |journal=Biomaterials |volume=27 |issue=20 |pages=3691–700 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16574222 |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.02.048 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16265647"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dusseault J, Tam SK, Ménard M |title=Evaluation of alginate purification methods: effect on polyphenol, endotoxin, and protein contamination |journal=J Biomed Mater Res A |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=243–51 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16265647 |doi=10.1002/jbm.a.30541 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16154192"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tam SK, Dusseault J, Polizu S, Ménard M, Hallé JP, Yahia L |title=Impact of residual contamination on the biofunctional properties of purified alginates used for cell encapsulation |journal=Biomaterials |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=1296–305 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16154192 |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.08.027 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that even though purification processes successfully lower endotoxin and polyphenol content in the processed alginate, it is difficult to lower the protein content&lt;ref name="pmid16265647"/&gt; and the purification processes could in turn modify the properties of the biomaterial.&lt;ref name="pmid16154192"/&gt; Thus it is essential that an effective purification process is designed so as to remove all the contaminants from alginate before it can be successfully used in clinical applications.

=====Modification and functionalization of alginate=====
Researchers have also been able to develop alginate microcapsules with an altered form of alginate with enhanced biocompatibility and higher resistance to osmotic swelling.&lt;ref name="pmid12579568"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=King A, Strand B, Rokstad AM |title=Improvement of the biocompatibility of alginate/poly-l-lysine/alginate microcapsules by the use of epimerized alginate as a coating |journal=J Biomed Mater Res A |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=533–9 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12579568 |doi=10.1002/jbm.a.10276 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12579569"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strand BL, Mørch YA, Syvertsen KR, Espevik T, Skjåk-Braek G |title=Microcapsules made by enzymatically tailored alginate |journal=J Biomed Mater Res A |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=540–50 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12579569 |doi=10.1002/jbm.a.10337 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another approach to increasing the biocompatibility of the membrane biomaterial is through surface modification of the capsules using [[peptide]] and protein molecules which in turn controls the proliferation and rate of differentiation of the encapsulated cells. One group that has been working extensively on coupling the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) to alginate hydrogels demonstrated that the cell behavior can be controlled by the RGD density coupled on the alginate gels. Alginate microparticles loaded with myoblast cells and functionalized with RGD allowed control over the growth and differentiation of the loaded cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rowley JA, Mooney DJ |title=Alginate type and RGD density control myoblast phenotype |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=217–223 |year=2002 |doi=10.1002/jbm.1287 |pmid=11857427 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boontheekul T, Kong HJ, Hsiong SX, Huang YC |title=Quantifying the relation between bond number and myoblast proliferation |journal=Faraday Discussions |volume=139 |pages=53–70 |year=2008 |doi=10.1039/B719928G |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another vital factor that controls the use of cell microcapsules in clinical applications is the development of a suitable immune-compatible polycation to coat the otherwise highly porous alginate beads and thus impart stability and immune protection to the system.&lt;ref name="pmid12514721"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orive G, Hernández RM, Gascón AR |title=Cell encapsulation: promise and progress |journal=Nat.

Thus several research groups have been looking for alternatives to PLL and have demonstrated promising results with poly-L-ornithine&lt;ref name="pmid10415570"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Calafiore R, Basta G, Luca G |title=Transplantation of pancreatic islets contained in minimal volume microcapsules in diabetic high mammalians |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=875 |issue= |pages=219–32 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10415570 |doi= 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08506.x|url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poly(methylene-co-guanidine) hydrochloride&lt;ref name="pmid9094138"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang T, Lacík I, Brissová M |title=An encapsulation system for the immunoisolation of pancreatic islets |journal=Nat.

Several groups have also investigated the use of [[chitosan]] which is a naturally derived polycation as a potential replacement for PLL to fabricate alginate-chitosan (AC) microcapsules for cell delivery applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haque T, Chen H, Ouyang W |title=In vitro study of alginate-chitosan microcapsules: an alternative to liver cell transplants for the treatment of liver failure |journal=Biotechnol.

====Collagen====
Collagen, a major protein component of the ECM, provides support to tissues like skin, cartilage, bones, blood vessels and ligaments and is thus considered a model scaffold or matrix for tissue engineering due to its properties of biocompatibility, [[Biodegradation|biodegradability]] and ability to promote cell binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chevallay B, Herbage D |title=collagen-based biomaterials as 3D scaffold for cell cultures: applications for tissue engineering and gene therapy |journal=Med Biol Eng Comput |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=211–8 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10829416 |doi= 10.1007/bf02344779|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability allows chitosan to control distribution of cells inside the polymeric system. Thus, Type-I collagen obtained from animal tissues is now successfully being used commercially as tissue engineered biomaterial for multiple applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malafaya PB, Silva GA, Reis RL |title=Natural-origin polymers as carriers and scaffolds for biomolecules and cell delivery in tissue engineering applications |journal=Adv.

====Gelatin====
[[Gelatin]] is prepared from the denaturation of [[collagen]] and many desirable properties such as [[Biodegradation|biodegradability]], biocompatibility, non-immunogenity in physiological  
environments, and easy processability make this polymer a good choice for tissue engineering applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young S, Wong M, Tabata Y, Mikos AG |title=Gelatin as a delivery vehicle for the controlled release of bioactive molecules |journal=J Control Release |volume=109 |issue=1–3 |pages=256–74 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16266768 |doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2005.09.023 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in engineering tissues for the skin, bone and cartilage and is used commercially for skin replacements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pieper JS, Hafmans T, van Wachem PB |title=Loading of collagen-heparan sulfate matrices with bFGF promotes angiogenesis and tissue generation in rats |journal=J.

====Chitosan====
[[Chitosan]] is a polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed β-(1-4)-linked D-glucosamine (deacetylated unit) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (acetylated unit). It is derived from the N-deacetylation of [[chitin]] and  has been used for several applications such as [[drug delivery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aiedeh K, Gianasi E, Orienti I, Zecchi V |title=chitosan microcapsules as controlled release systems for insulin |journal=J Microencapsul |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=567–76 |year=1997 |pmid=9292433 |doi=10.3109/02652049709006810 |url=|title-link=chitosan }}&lt;/ref&gt; space-filling implants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Muzzarelli R, Baldassarre V, Conti F |title=Biological activity of chitosan: ultrastructural study |journal=Biomaterials |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=247–52 |date=May 1988 |pmid=3408796 |doi= 10.1016/0142-9612(88)90092-0|url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in wound dressings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Altiok D, Altiok E, Tihminlioglu F |title=Physical, antibacterial and antioxidant properties of chitosan films incorporated with thyme oil for potential wound healing applications |journal=J Mater Sci Mater Med |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=2227–36 |date=July 2010 |pmid=20372985 |doi=10.1007/s10856-010-4065-x |url=|hdl=11147/2717 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one drawback of this polymer is its weak mechanical properties  and is thus often combined with other polymers  such [[collagen]] to form a polymer with stronger mechanical properties for cell encapsulation applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tan W, Krishnaraj R, Desai TA |title=Evaluation of nanostructured composite collagen--chitosan matrices for tissue engineering |journal=Tissue Eng. |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=203–10 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11304455 |doi=10.1089/107632701300062831 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cellulose Sulphate ====
Cellulose sulphate is derived from cotton and, once processed appropriately, can be used as a biocompatible base in which to suspend cells. When the poly-anionic cellulose sulphate solution is immersed in a second, poly-cationic solution (e.g. pDADMAC), a semi-permeable membrane is formed around the suspended cells as a result of gelation between the two poly-ions. Both mammalian cell lines and bacterial cells remain viable and continue to replicate within the capsule membrane in order to fill-out the capsule. As such, in contrast to some other encapsulation materials, the capsules can be used to grow cells and act as such like a mini-bioreactor. The biocompatible nature of the material has been demonstrated by observation during studies using the cell-filled capsules themselves for implantation as well as isolated capsule material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dautzenberg|first=H |author2=Schuldt, U |author3=Grasnick, G |author4=Karle, P |author5=Müller, P |author6=Löhr, M |author7=Pelegrin, M |author8=Piechaczyk, M |author9=Rombs, KV |author10=Günzburg, WH |author11=Salmons, B |author12=Saller, RM|title=Development of cellulose sulfate-based polyelectrolyte complex microcapsules for medical applications.|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=Jun 18, 1999|volume=875|pages=46–63|pmid=10415557|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08493.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capsules formed from cellulose sulphate have been successfully used, showing safety and efficacy, in clinical and pre-clinical trials in both humans and animals, primarily as anti-cancer treatments, but also exploring possible uses for gene therapy or antibody therapies.&lt;ref name="Löhr 393–8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pelegrin 828–34"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pelegrin|first=M|author2=Marin, M |author3=Noël, D |author4=Del Rio, M |author5=Saller, R |author6=Stange, J |author7=Mitzner, S |author8=Günzburg, WH |author9=Piechaczyk, M |title=Systemic long-term delivery of antibodies in immunocompetent animals using cellulose sulphate capsules containing antibody-producing cells.|journal=Gene Therapy|date=June 1998|volume=5|issue=6|pages=828–34|pmid=9747463|doi=10.1038/sj.gt.3300632}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pelegrin 1407–15"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pelegrin|first=M|author2=Marin, M |author3=Oates, A |author4=Noël, D |author5=Saller, R |author6=Salmons, B |author7= Piechaczyk, M |title=Immunotherapy of a viral disease by in vivo production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.|journal=Human Gene Therapy|date=Jul 1, 2000|volume=11|issue=10|pages=1407–15|pmid=10910138|doi=10.1089/10430340050057486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armeanu|first=S |author2=Haessler, I |author3=Saller, R |author4=Engelmann, MG |author5=Heinemann, F |author6=Krausz, E |author7=Stange, J |author8=Mitzner, S |author9=Salmons, B |author10=Günzburg, WH |author11=Nikol, S|title=In vivo perivascular implantation of encapsulated packaging cells for prolonged retroviral gene transfer.|journal=Journal of Microencapsulation|date=Jul–Aug 2001|volume=18|issue=4|pages=491–506|pmid=11428678|doi=10.1080/02652040010018047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winiarczyk|first=S |author2=Gradski, Z |author3=Kosztolich, B |author4=Gabler, C |author5=König, G |author6=Renner, M |author7=Saller, RM |author8=Prosl, H |author9=Salmons, B |author10=Günzburg, WH |author11=Hain, J|title=A clinical protocol for treatment of canine mammary tumors using encapsulated, cytochrome P450 synthesizing cells activating cyclophosphamide: a phase I/II study.|journal=Journal of Molecular Medicine|date=September 2002|volume=80|issue=9|pages=610–4|pmid=12226743|doi=10.1007/s00109-002-0356-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using cellulose sulphate it has been possible to manufacture encapsulated cells as a pharmaceutical product at large scale and fulfilling Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) standards.

=== Biocompatibility ===
The use of an ideal high quality biomaterial with the inherent properties of biocompatibility is the most crucial factor that governs the long term efficiency of this technology. An ideal biomaterial for cell encapsulation should be one that is totally [[Biocompatibility|biocompatible]], does not trigger an immune response in the host and does not interfere with cell [[homeostasis]] so as to ensure high cell viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rabanel |first=Michel |author2=Nicolas Bertrand |author3=Shilpa Sant |author4=Salma Louati |author5=Patrice Hildgen |title=ACS Symposium Series, Vol. 934 |chapter=Polysaccharide Hydrogels for the Preparation of Immunoisolated Cell Delivery Systems |publisher=American Chemical Society |pages=305–309 |date=June 2006 |isbn=978-0-8412-3960-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one major limitation has been the inability to reproduce the different biomaterials and the requirements to obtain a better understanding of the chemistry and biofunctionality of the biomaterials and the [[microencapsulation]] system.&lt;ref name="pubs.rsc.org"/&gt;  Several studies demonstrate that surface modification of these cell containing microparticles allows control over the growth and cellular differentiation.&lt;ref name="pubs.rsc.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18724374"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Benoit DS, Schwartz MP, Durney AR, Anseth KS |title=Small functional groups for controlled differentiation of hydrogel-encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells |journal=Nat Mater |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=816–23 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18724374 |pmc=2929915 |doi=10.1038/nmat2269 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the encapsulated cells.&lt;ref name="pmid19344677"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orive G, De Castro M, Kong HJ |title=Bioactive cell-hydrogel microcapsules for cell-based drug delivery |journal=J Control Release |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=203–10 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19344677 |doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.01.005 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study proposed the use of [[zeta potential]] which measures the [[electric charge]] of the microcapsule as a means to predict the interfacial reaction between microcapsule and the surrounding tissue and in turn the biocompatibility of the delivery system.&lt;ref name="pmid17058213"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Vos P, de Haan BJ, Kamps JA, Faas MM, Kitano T |title=Zeta-potentials of alginate-PLL capsules: a predictive measure for biocompatibility? |journal=J Biomed Mater Res A |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=813–9 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17058213 |doi=10.1002/jbm.a.30979 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical strength and durability===
It is essential that the microcapsules have adequate membrane strength (mechanical stability) to endure physical and [[osmotic shock|osmotic stress]] such as during the exchange of nutrients and waste products. The microcapsules should be strong enough and should not rupture on implantation as this could lead to an immune rejection of the encapsulated cells.&lt;ref name="pmid19551901"/&gt; For instance, in the case of [[xenotransplantation]], a tighter more stable membrane would be required in comparison to [[allotransplantation]]. Also, while investigating the potential of using APA microcapsules loaded with bile salt hydrolase (BSH) overproducing active [[Lactobacillus]] plantarum 80 cells, in a simulated [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastro intestinal tract]] model for oral delivery applications, the mechanical integrity and shape of the microcapsules was evaluated. It was shown that APA microcapsules could potentially be used in the oral delivery of live bacterial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martoni C, Bhathena J, Jones ML, Urbanska AM, Chen H, Prakash S |title=Investigation of microencapsulated BSH active Lactobacillus in the simulated human GI tract |journal=J.

The capsules were pumped through a series of vessels simulating the human GI tract to determine how well the capsules would survive in the body. Extensive research into the mechanical properties of the biomaterial to be used for cell microencapsulation is necessary to determine the durability of the microcapsules during production and especially for in vivo applications where a sustained release of the therapeutic product over long durations is required.

=== Microcapsule Generation ===

==== Microfluidics ====

Droplet-based microfluidics can be used to generate microparticles with repeatable size.&lt;ref name="Zhou etal" /&gt;

* manipulation of alginate solution to allow microcapsules to be created

==== [[Electrospray]]ing Techniques&lt;ref name="Nikoo 605–612"/&gt; ====
Eletrospraying is used to create alginate spheres by pumping an alginate solution through a needle. A source of high voltage usually provided by a clamp attached to the needle is used to generate an electric potential with the alginate falling from the needle tip into a solution that contains a ground.  Calcium chloride is used as cross linking solution in which the generated capsules drop into where they harden after approximately 30 minutes. Beads are formed from the needle due to charge and surface tension.
* Size dependency of the beads
** height alterations of device from needle to calcium chloride solution
** voltage alterations of clamp on the needle
** alginate concentration alterations

===Microcapsule size===
The diameter of the microcapsules is an important factor that influences both the immune response towards the cell microcapsules as well as the mass transport across the capsule membrane. Studies show that the cellular response to smaller capsules is much lesser as compared to larger capsules&lt;ref name="pmid16680700"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sakai S, Mu C, Kawabata K, Hashimoto I, Kawakami K |title=Biocompatibility of subsieve-size capsules versus conventional-size microcapsules |journal=J Biomed Mater Res A |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=394–8 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16680700 |doi=10.1002/jbm.a.30676 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in general the diameter of the cell loaded microcapsules should be between 350-450&amp;nbsp;µm so as to enable effective diffusion across the semi-permeable membrane.&lt;ref name="pmid15603828"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugiura S, Oda T, Izumida Y |title=Size control of calcium alginate beads containing living cells using micro-nozzle array |journal=Biomaterials |volume=26 |issue=16 |pages=3327–31 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15603828 |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.08.029 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Renken A, Hunkeler D |title=Microencapsulation: a review of polymers and technologies with a focus on bioartificial organs |journal=Polimery |volume=43 |pages=530–539 |year=1998 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell choice===
The cell type chosen for this technique depends on the desired application of the cell microcapsules. The cells put into the capsules can be from the patient ([[Autotransplantation|autologous]] cells), from another donor (allogeneic cells) or from other species (xenogeneic cells).&lt;ref name="pmid12767713"/&gt; The use of autologous cells in microencapsulation therapy is limited by the availability of these cells and even though xenogeneic cells are easily accessible, danger of possible transmission of [[virus]]es, especially [[porcine]] endogenous [[retrovirus]] to the patient restricts their clinical application,&lt;ref name="pmid10782067"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Günzburg WH, Salmons B |title=Xenotransplantation: is the risk of viral infection as great as we thought? |journal=Mol Med Today |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=199–208 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10782067 |doi= 10.1016/s1357-4310(00)01708-1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after much debate several groups have concluded that studies should involve the use of allogeneic instead of xenogeneic cells.&lt;ref name="pmid11797662"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hunkeler D |title=Allo transplants xeno: as bioartificial organs move to the clinic.

This technology has not received approval for clinical trial because of the high immunogenicity of cells loaded in the capsules.

==Non-Therapeutic Applications==
[[Probiotic]]s are increasingly being used in numerous dairy products such as ice cream, milk powders, yoghurts, frozen dairy desserts and cheese due to their important health benefits. But, low viability of probiotic [[bacteria]] in the food still remains a major hurdle. The [[pH]], dissolved oxygen content, titratable acidity, storage temperature, species and strains of associative fermented dairy product organisms and concentration of lactic and acetic acids are some of the factors that greatly affect the probiotic viability in the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dave RI, Shah NP |title=Viability of yoghurt and probiotic bacteria in yoghurts made from commercial starter cultures |journal=International Dairy Journal |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=31–41 |date=January 1997 |doi=10.1016/S0958-6946(96)00046-5 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kailasapathy K, Supriadi D |title=Effect of whey protein concentrate on the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus in lactose hydrolysed yoghurt during refrigerated storage |journal=Milchwissenschaft |volume=51 |pages=565–569 |year=1996 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lankaputhra WE, Shah NP, Britz ML |title=Survival of Bifidobacteria during refrigerated storage in the presence of acid and hydrogen peroxide |journal=Milchwissenschaft |volume=51 |pages=65–70 |year=1996 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As set by [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the United Nations and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the standard in order to be considered a health food with probitic addition, the product should contain per gram at least 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; [[Colony-forming unit|cfu]] of [[:wikt:viable|viable]] probiotic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Health and nutritional properties of probiotics in food including powder milk with live lactic acid bacteria |newspaper=FAO/WHO Experts’ Report |publisher=FAQ/WHO |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary that the bacterial cells remain stable and healthy in the manufactured product, are sufficiently [[:wikt:viable|viable]] while moving through the upper digestive tract and are able to provide positive effects upon reaching the intestine of the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gilliland SE |title=Acidophilus milk products: a review of potential benefits to consumers |journal=J.

Apart from dairy products, microencapsulated probiotics have also been used in non-dairy products, such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20101123210115/http://integratedhealth.com/hpdspec/therasweet.htm TheresweetTM] which is a [[Sugar substitute|sweetener]]. It can be used as a convenient vehicle for delivery of encapsulated ''Lactobacillus'' to the intestine although it is not itself a dairy product.

==Therapeutic Applications==

===Diabetes===
The potential of using [[Artificial pancreas|bioartificial pancreas]], for treatment of [[diabetes mellitus]], based on encapsulating [[Islets of Langerhans|islet]] cells within a semi permeable membrane is extensively being studied by scientists. These devices could eliminate the need for of [[immunosuppressive drug]]s in addition to finally solving the problem of shortage of organ donors. The use of microencapsulation would protect the islet cells from immune rejection as well as allow the use of animal cells or genetically modified insulin-producing cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kizilel S, Garfinkel M, Opara E |title=The bioartificial pancreas: progress and challenges |journal=Diabetes Technol.

Several studies have been dedicated towards the development of bioartificial pancreas involving the immobilization of islets of Langerhans inside polymeric capsules. The first attempt towards this aim was demonstrated in 1980 by Lim et al. where xenograft islet cells were encapsulated inside alginate polylysine microcapsules and showed significant in vivo results for several weeks.&lt;ref name="pmid6776628"/&gt; It is envisaged that the implantation of these encapsulated cells would help to overcome the use of immunosuppressive drugs and also allow the use of xenograft cells thus obviating the problem of donor shortage.

Using sodium cellulose sulphate technology from Austrianova Singapore an islet cell line was encapsulated and it was demonstrated that the cells remain viable and release insulin in response to glucose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stadlbauer|first=V|author2=Stiegler, PB |author3=Schaffellner, S |author4=Hauser, O |author5=Halwachs, G |author6=Iberer, F |author7=Tscheliessnigg, KH |author8= Lackner, C |title=Morphological and functional characterization of a pancreatic beta-cell line microencapsulated in sodium cellulose sulfate/poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride).|journal=Xenotransplantation|date=July 2006|volume=13|issue=4|pages=337–44|pmid=16768727|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3089.2006.00315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-clinical studies, implanted, encapsulated cells were able to restore blood glucose levels in diabetic rats over a period of 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steigler|first=P |author2=Stadlbauer, V. |author3=Hackl, F. |author4=Iberer, F. |author5=Lackner, C. |author6=Hauser, O. |author7=Schaffellner, S. |author8=Strunk, D. |author9=Tscheliessnigg, K.|title=Xenotransplantation of NaCS microencapsulated porcine islet cells in diabetic rats|journal=Organ Biology|year=2009|volume=16|issue=1|pages=104|url=https://mol.medicalonline.jp/archive/search?jo=ca3organ&amp;ye=2009&amp;vo=16&amp;issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
The use of cell encapsulated microcapsules towards the treatment of several forms of [[cancer]] has shown great potential. One approach undertaken by researchers is through the implantation of microcapsules containing genetically modified cytokine secreting cells. An example of this was demonstrated by Cirone et al. when genetically modified [[Interleukin 2|IL-2 cytokine]] secreting   non-[[Autotransplantation|autologous]] mouse [[myoblast]]s implanted into mice showed a delay in the [[tumor]] growth with an increased rate of survival of the animals.&lt;ref name="pmid12133269"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cirone P, Bourgeois JM, Austin RC, Chang PL |title=A novel approach to tumor suppression with microencapsulated recombinant cells |journal=Hum. Gene Ther. |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=1157–66 |date=July 2002 |pmid=12133269 |doi=10.1089/104303402320138943 |url=|hdl=1807.1/817 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the efficiency of this treatment was brief due to an immune response towards the implanted microcapsules. 
Another approach to cancer suppression is through the use of angiogenesis inhibitors to prevent the release of [[growth factor]]s which lead to the spread of tumors. The effect of implanting microcapsules loaded with xenogenic cells genetically modified to secrete [[endostatin]], an [[Angiogenesis inhibitor|antiangiogenic]] drug which causes [[apoptosis]] in [[tumor]] cells, has been extensively studied.&lt;ref name="pmid11135549"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Joki T, Machluf M, Atala A |title=Continuous release of endostatin from microencapsulated engineered cells for tumor therapy |journal=Nat.

In 1998, a murine model of pancreatic cancer was used to study the effect of implanting genetically modified [[cytochrome P450]] expressing feline [[Epithelium|epithelial]] cells encapsulated in cellulose sulfate polymers for the treatment of solid tumors.&lt;ref name="pmid10026857"&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Karle P, Müller P, Renz R |title=Intratumoral injection of encapsulated cells producing an oxazaphosphorine activating cytochrome P450 for targeted chemotherapy |journal=Adv.

On the basis of these results, an encapsulated cell therapy product, NovaCaps, was tested in a phaseI/II clinical trial for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in patients&lt;ref name="pmid11377651"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Löhr M, Hoffmeyer A, Kröger J |title=Microencapsulated cell-mediated treatment of inoperable pancreatic carcinoma |journal=Lancet |volume=357 |issue=9268 |pages=1591–2 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11377651 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04749-8|url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lohr M, Kroger JC, Hoffmeyer A |title=Safety, feasibility and clinical benefit of localized chemotherapy using microencapsulated cells for inoperable pancreatic carcinoma in a phase I/II trial |journal=Ccancer Ther |volume=1 |pages=121–131 |year=2003 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has recently been designated by the European medicines agency (EMEA) as an orphan drug in Europe. A further phase I/II clinical trial using the same product confirmed the results of the first trial, demonstrating an approximate doubling of survival time in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lam|first=P|author2=Khan, G |author3=Stripecke, R |author4=Hui, KM |author5=Kasahara, N |author6=Peng, KW |author7= Guinn, BA |title=The innovative evolution of cancer gene and cellular therapies.|journal=Cancer Gene Therapy|date=March 2013|volume=20|issue=3|pages=141–9|pmid=23370333|doi=10.1038/cgt.2012.93}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all of these trials using cellulose sulphate, in addition to the clear anti-tumour effects, the capsules were well tolerated and there were no adverse reactions seen such as immune response to the capsules, demonstrating the biocompatible nature of the cellulose sulphate capsules. In one patient the capsules were in place for almost 2 years with no side effects.

These studies show the promising potential application of cell microcapsules towards the treatment of cancers.&lt;ref name="pubs.rsc.org"/&gt; However, solutions to issues such as immune response leading to inflammation of the surrounding tissue at the site of capsule implantation have to be researched in detail before more clinical trials are possible.

===Heart Diseases===
Numerous studies have been dedicated towards the development of effective methods to enable [[Cardiac muscle|cardiac]] tissue regeneration in patients after [[Ischemia|ischemic]] heart disease. An emerging approach to answer the problems related to ischemic tissue repair is through the use of stem cell-based therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Collins SD, Baffour R, Waksman R |title=Cell therapy in myocardial infarction |journal=Cardiovasc Revasc Med |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=43–51 |year=2007 |pmid=17293268 |doi=10.1016/j.carrev.2006.11.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual mechanism due to which this stem cell-based therapy has generative effects on cardiac function is still under investigation. Even though numerous methods have been studied for cell administration, the efficiency of the number of cells retained in the beating heart after implantation is still very low. A promising approach to overcome this problem is through the use of cell microencapsulation therapy which has shown to enable a higher cell retention as compared to the injection of free [[stem cell]]s into the heart.&lt;ref name="pmid19761398"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paul A, Ge Y, Prakash S, Shum-Tim D |title=Microencapsulated stem cells for tissue repairing: implications in cell-based myocardial therapy |journal=Regen Med |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=733–45 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19761398 |doi=10.2217/rme.09.43 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strategy to improve the impact of cell based encapsulation technique towards cardiac regenerative applications is through the use of genetically modified stem cells capable of secreting angiogenic factors such as [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) which stimulate [[neovascularization]] and restore [[perfusion]] in the damaged ischemic heart.&lt;ref name="pmid15778410"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Madeddu P |title=Therapeutic angiogenesis and vasculogenesis for tissue regeneration |journal=Exp. Physiol. |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=315–26 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15778410 |doi=10.1113/EXPPHYSIOL.2004.028571|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18061883"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacobs J |title=Combating cardiovascular disease with angiogenic therapy |journal=Drug Discov.

===Monoclonal Antibody Therapy===
The use of monoclonal antibodies for therapy is now widespread for treatment of cancers and inflammatory diseases. Using cellulose sulphate technology, scientists have successfully encapsulated antibody producing hybridoma cells and demonstrated subsequent release of the therapeutic antibody from the capsules.&lt;ref name="Pelegrin 828–34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pelegrin 1407–15"/&gt; The capsules containing the hybridoma cells were used in pre-clinical studies to deliver neutralising antibodies to the mouse retrovirus FrCasE, successfully preventing disease.

===Other conditions===
Many other medical conditions have been targeted with encapsulation therapies, especially those involving a deficiency in some biologically derived protein. One of the most successful approaches is an external device that acts similarly to a [[dialysis machine]], only with a reservoir of pig [[hepatocytes]] surrounding the semipermeable portion of the blood-infused tubing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonavita|first=AG|author2=Quaresma K|author3=Cotta-de-Almeida V|author4=Pinto MA|author5=Saraiva RM|title=Hepatocyte xenotransplantation for treating liver disease|journal=Xenotransplantation|date=May–June 2010|pages=181–187|pmid=20636538|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3089.2010.00588.x|volume=17|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This apparatus can remove toxins from the blood of patients suffering severe [[liver failure]]. Other applications that are still in development include cells that produce [[Ciliary neurotrophic factor|Ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor]] for the treatment of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] and [[Huntington's Disease]], [[Glial-derived neurotrophic factor]] for [[Parkinson's Disease]], [[Erythropoietin]] for [[Anemia]], and [[Human growth hormone|HGH]] for [[Dwarfism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lysaght|first=Micheal J.|author2=Patrick Aebischer|title=Encapsulated Cells as Therapy|journal=Scientific American|date=April 1999|pages=76–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, monogeneic diseases such as haemophilia, Gaucher's disease and some Mucopolysaccharide disorders could also potentially be targeted by encapsulated cells expressing the protein that is otherwise lacking in the patient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2445">In 1925 [[William Weir, 1st Viscount Weir|Lord Weir]] chaired a committee that proposed the creation of the Central Electricity Board (CEB) to link the UK’s most efficient power stations with consumers
via a ‘national gridiron’.

The United Kingdom '''Central Electricity Board''' was set up under '''The Electricity (Supply) Act 1926''' to standardise the nation's [[electrical power|electricity supply]]. At that time, the industry consisted of more than 600 electricity supply companies and local authority undertakings, and different areas operated at different [[voltage]]s and [[frequency|frequencies]] (including [[direct current|DC]] in some places). The board's first chairman was [[Andrew Rae Duncan|Andrew Duncan]].

The CEB established the UK's first synchronised AC grid, running at 132 [[volt|kilovolts]] and 50 [[Hertz]], which by 1933 was a collection of local grids, with emergency interlinks, covering most of [[England]]. This started operating as a national system, the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]], in 1938. The CEB ceased to exist when the grid was nationalised by the [[Electricity Act 1947 (UK)|Electricity Act 1947]] and taken over by the [[British Electricity Authority]].

The CEB coexisted with the [[Electricity Commissioners]], an industry regulator responsible to the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]].

'''Chemiluminescence''' (also '''chemoluminescence''') is the emission of light ([[luminescence]]), as the result of a chemical reaction. There may also be limited emission of heat. Given [[reactants]] '''A''' and '''B''', with an excited [[reactive intermediate|intermediate]] '''◊''',
:['''A'''] + ['''B'''] → ['''◊'''] → [''Products''] + [[light]]

For example, if  [A] is [[luminol]] and [B] is [[hydrogen peroxide]] in the presence of a suitable catalyst we have:

:&lt;chem&gt;\underset{luminol}{C8H7N3O2} + \underset{hydrogen\ peroxide}{H2O2} -&gt; 3-APA[\lozenge] -&gt; {3-APA} + light&lt;/chem&gt;

where:

* 3-APA is [[3-aminophthalate]]
* 3-APA['''◊'''] is the [[vibronic spectroscopy|vibronic]] excited state fluorescing as it decays to a lower energy level.

==General description==
[[File:Chemoluminescent reaction.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A chemoluminescent reaction in an [[Erlenmeyer flask]] ]]
The decay of this excited state['''◊'''] to a lower energy level causes light emission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vacher|first1=Morgane|last2=Fdez. Galván|first2=Ignacio|last3=Ding|first3=Bo-Wen|last4=Schramm|first4=Stefan|last5=Berraud-Pache|first5=Romain|last6=Naumov|first6=Panče|last7=Ferré|first7=Nicolas|last8=Liu|first8=Ya-Jun|last9=Navizet|first9=Isabelle|last10=Roca-Sanjuán|first10=Daniel|last11=Baader|first11=Wilhelm J.|last12=Lindh|first12=Roland|title=Chemi- and Bioluminescence of Cyclic Peroxides|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=March 2018|doi=10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00649}}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, one [[photon]] of light should be given off for each molecule of [[reactant]].  This is equivalent to [[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]] of photons per mole of reactant. In actual practice, non-enzymatic reactions seldom exceed 1% Q&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, [[quantum efficiency]].

In a [[chemical reaction]], reactants collide to form a [[transition state]], the [[Enthalpy|enthalpic]] maximum in a reaction coordinate diagram, which proceeds to the product.  Normally, reactants form products of lesser chemical energy.  The difference in energy between reactants and products, represented as &lt;math&gt;\Delta H_{rxn}&lt;/math&gt;, is turned into heat, physically realized as [[Excited state|excitation]]s in the [[Molecular vibration|vibrational state]] of the normal modes of the product.  Since vibrational energy is generally much greater than the thermal agitation, it rapidly disperses in the solvent through molecular rotation.  This is how [[exothermic]] reactions make their solutions hotter.  In a chemiluminescent reaction, the direct product of the reaction is an excited [[electronic state]]. This state then decays into an electronic [[ground state]] and emits light through either an [[selection rule|allowed transition]] (analogous to [[fluorescence]]) or a forbidden transition (analogous to [[phosphorescence]]), depending partly on the [[Spin (physics)|spin state]] of the electronic excited state formed.

Chemiluminescence differs from [[fluorescence]] or [[phosphorescence]] in that the electronic excited state is the product of a chemical reaction rather than of the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of a photon]].  It is the antithesis of a [[photochemical]] reaction, in which light is used to drive an endothermic chemical reaction.  Here, light is ''generated'' from a chemically exothermic reaction. The chemiluminescence might be also induced by an electrochemical stimulus, in this case is called [[electrochemiluminescence]].

A standard example of chemiluminescence in the laboratory setting is the [[luminol]] test.  Here, [[blood]] is indicated by [[luminescence]] upon contact with [[iron]] in [[hemoglobin]]. When chemiluminescence takes place in living organisms, the phenomenon is called [[bioluminescence]]. A [[light stick]] emits light by chemiluminescence.

== Liquid-phase reactions ==
Chemiluminescence in aqueous system is mainly caused by redox reactions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Syed Niaz Ali|last2=Lin|first2=Jin-Ming|title=Recent advances in chemiluminescence based on carbonaceous dots|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=241|pages=24–36|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2017.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The luminol reaction is

:&lt;chem&gt;\underset{luminol}{C8H7N3O2} + \underset{hydrogen\ peroxide}{H2O2} -&gt; 3-APA[\lozenge] -&gt; {3-APA} + light&lt;/chem&gt;

== Gas-phase reactions ==
[[Image:Knicklichter.jpg|thumb|Green and blue [[glow stick]]s]]
* One of the oldest known chemiluminescent reactions is that of elemental white [[phosphorus]] oxidizing in moist air, producing a green glow. This is a gas-phase reaction of phosphorus vapor, above the solid, with oxygen producing the excited states (PO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HPO.&lt;ref name=Rauhut&gt;Rauhut, Michael M. (1985), Chemiluminescence. In Grayson, Martin (Ed) (1985). ''Kirk-Othmer Concise Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology'' (3rd ed), pp 247 John Wiley and Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-51700-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another gas phase reaction is the basis of [[nitric oxide]] detection in commercial analytic instruments applied to environmental air-quality testing. [[Ozone]] is combined with [[nitric oxide]] to form [[nitrogen dioxide]] in an activated state.

:NO+O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  → NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;['''◊''']+ O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:The activated NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;['''◊'''] luminesces broadband visible to infrared light as it reverts to a lower energy state. A [[photomultiplier]] and associated electronics counts the photons that are proportional to the amount of NO present. To determine the amount of [[nitrogen dioxide]], NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in a sample (containing no NO) it must first be converted to nitric oxide, NO, by passing the sample through a converter before the above ozone activation reaction is applied. The ozone reaction produces a photon count proportional to NO that is proportional to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; before it was converted to NO. In the case of a mixed sample that contains both NO and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the above reaction yields the amount of NO and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; combined in the air sample, assuming that the sample is passed through the converter. If the mixed sample is not passed through the converter, the ozone reaction produces activated NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;['''◊'''] only in proportion to the NO in the sample.  The NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the sample is not activated by the ozone reaction. Though unactivated NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is present with the activated NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;['''◊'''], photons are emitted only by the activated species that is proportional to original NO. Final step: Subtract NO from (NO + NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to yield NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fannation.com/blogs/post/300795 Air Zoom | Glowing with Pride]. Fannation.com.

== Infrared chemiluminescence ==
In [[chemical kinetics]], ''infrared chemiluminiscence'' (IRCL) refers to the emission of infrared photons from vibrationally excited product molecules immediately after their formation. The intensities of infrared emission lines from vibrationally excited molecules are used to measure the populations of vibrational states of product molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins P. and de Paula J.

The observation of IRCL was developed as a kinetic technique by [[John Polanyi]], who used it to study the [[Potential energy surface#Attractive and repulsive surfaces|attractive or repulsive nature]] of the [[potential energy surface]] for gas-phase reactions. In general the IRCL is much more intense for reactions with an attractive surface, indicating that this type of surface leads to energy deposition in vibrational excitation. In contrast reactions with a repulsive potential energy surface lead to little IRCL, indicating that the energy is primarily deposited as translational energy.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins P. and de Paula J. p.889-890&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enhanced chemiluminescence ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Enhanced chemiluminescence]] --&gt;
Enhanced chemiluminescence is a common technique for a variety of detection assays in biology.  A [[horseradish peroxidase]] enzyme (HRP) is tethered to an antibody that specifically recognizes the molecule of interest.  This enzyme complex then catalyzes the conversion of the enhanced chemiluminescent substrate into a sensitized reagent in the vicinity of the molecule of interest, which on further [[oxidation]] by [[hydrogen peroxide]], produces a triplet (excited) [[carbonyl]], which emits light when it decays to the singlet carbonyl.  Enhanced chemiluminescence allows detection of minute quantities of a biomolecule. Proteins can be detected down to femtomole quantities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biocompare.com/review/887/SuperSignal(r)-West-Femto-Maximum-Sensitivity-Substrate-From-Pierce.html Enhanced CL review].

* Gas analysis: for determining small amounts of impurities or poisons in air. Other compounds can also be determined by this method ([[ozone]], N-oxides, S-compounds). A typical example is NO determination with detection limits down to 1 ppb.

== Biological applications ==
Chemiluminescence has been applied by [[forensic scientists]] to solve crimes. In this case, they use luminol and hydrogen peroxide. The iron from the blood acts as a catalyst and reacts with the luminol and hydrogen peroxide to produce blue light for about 30 seconds. Because only a small amount of iron is required for chemiluminescence, trace amounts of blood are sufficient.

In biomedical research, the protein that gives [[fireflies]] their glow and its co-factor, [[luciferin]], are used to produce red light through the consumption of ATP.  This reaction is used in many applications, including the effectiveness of cancer drugs that choke off a tumor's blood supply{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. This form of [[bioluminescence]] imaging allows scientists to test drugs in the pre-clinical stages cheaply.
Another protein, [[aequorin]], found in certain jellyfish, produces blue light in the presence of calcium. It can be used in molecular biology to assess calcium levels in cells. What these biological reactions have in common is their use of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) as an energy source. Though the structure of the molecules that produce luminescence is different for each species, they are given the generic name of luciferin. Firefly luciferin can be oxidized to produce an excited complex. Once it falls back down to a ground state a photon is released. It is very similar to the reaction with luminol.

:&lt;chem&gt;Luciferin{} + O2{} + ATP -&gt;[\text{Luciferase}] Oxyluciferin{} + CO2{} + AMP{} + PPi{} + light&lt;/chem&gt;
Many organisms have evolved to produce light in a range of colors. At the molecular level, the difference in color arises from the degree of conjugation of the molecule, when an electron drops down from the excited state to the ground state. Deep sea organisms have evolved to produce light to lure and catch prey, as camouflage, or to attract others. Some bacteria even use bioluminescence to communicate. The common colors for the light emitted by these animals are blue and green because they have shorter wavelength than red and can transmit more easily in water.

Chemiluminescence is different from [[fluorescence]]. Hence the application of fluorescent proteins such as [[Green fluorescent protein]] is not a biological application of chemiluminescence.

A '''collision cascade''' (also known as a displacement cascade or a displacement spike) is a set of nearby adjacent energetic (much higher than ordinary thermal energies) collisions of [[atom]]s induced by an energetic particle in a solid or liquid.&lt;ref name="Ave98"&gt;

If the maximum atom or ion energies in a collision cascade are higher than the [[threshold displacement energy]] of the material (tens of [[Electronvolt|eV]]s or more), the collisions can permanently displace atoms from their lattice sites and produce [[crystallographic defect|defect]]s. The initial energetic atom can be, e.g., an [[ion]] from a [[particle accelerator]], an atomic recoil produced by a passing high-energy [[neutron]], [[electron]] or [[photon]], or be produced when a radioactive nucleus decays and gives the atom a recoil energy.

The nature of collision cascades can vary strongly depending on the energy and mass of the recoil/incoming ion and density of the material ([[stopping power (particle radiation)|stopping power]]).

==Linear cascades==

[[File:bca collisions.png|right|thumb|Schematic illustration of independent binary collisions between atoms]]

When the initial recoil/ion mass is low, and the material where the cascade occurs has a low density (i.e. the recoil-material combination has a low [[stopping power (particle radiation)|stopping power]]), the collisions between the initial recoil and sample atoms occur rarely, and can be understood well as a sequence of independent binary collisions between atoms. This kind of a cascade can be theoretically well treated using the [[binary collision approximation]] (BCA) simulation approach. For instance, H and He ions with energies below 10 keV can be expected to lead to purely linear cascades in all materials.

[[File:linearcollisioncascade.png|right|thumb|

The thick line illustrates the position of the surface, and the thinner lines the ballistic movement paths of the atoms from beginning until they stop in the material. The purple circle is the incoming ion. Red, blue, green and yellow circles illustrate primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary recoils, respectively. In between the ballistic collisions the ions move in a straight path.]]

The most commonly used BCA code [[Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter|SRIM]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srim.org SRIM web site]&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to simulate linear collision cascades in disordered materials for all ion in all materials up to ion energies of 1 [[GeV]]. Note, however, that SRIM does not treat effects such as damage due to electronic energy deposition or damage produced by excited electrons. The nuclear and electronic [[stopping power (particle radiation)|stopping power]]s used are averaging fits to experiments, and are thus not perfectly accurate either. The electronic stopping power can be readily included in [[binary collision approximation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=M.

In linear cascades the set of recoils produced in the sample can be described as a sequence of recoil generations depending on how many collision steps have passed since the original collision: [[PKA (Irradiation)|primary knock-on atoms]] (PKA), secondary knock-on atoms (SKA), tertiary knock-on atoms (TKA), etc. Since it is extremely unlikely that all energy would be transferred to a knock-on atom, each generation of recoil atoms has on average less energy than the previous, and eventually the knock-on atom energies go below the [[threshold displacement energy]] for damage production, at which point no more damage can be produced.

==Heat spikes (thermal spikes)==

When the ion is heavy and energetic enough, and the material is dense, the collisions between the ions may occur so near to each other that they can not be considered independent of each other. In this case the process becomes a complicated process of many-body interactions between hundreds and tens of thousands of atoms, which can not be treated with the BCA, but can be modelled using [[molecular dynamics]] methods.&lt;ref name="Ave98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gib60"&gt;

[[File:heatspikecollisioncascade.png|right|thumb|As above, but in the middle the region of collisions has become so dense that multiple collisions occur simultaneously, which is called a heat spike. In this region the ions move in complex paths, and it is not possible to distinguish the numerical order of recoils - hence the atoms are colored with a mixture of red and blue.]]

Typically, a heat spike is characterized by the formation of a transient underdense region in the center of the cascade, and an overdense region around it.&lt;ref name="Ave98" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sei56&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the cascade, the overdense region becomes [[interstitial defect]]s, and the underdense region typically becomes a region of [[crystallographic defect|vacancies]].

If the kinetic energy of the atoms in the region of dense collisions is recalculated into temperature (using the basic equation E = 3/2·N·k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T), one finds that the kinetic energy in units of temperature is initially of the order of 10,000 K. Because of this, the region can be considered to be very hot, and is therefore called a ''heat spike'' or ''thermal spike'' (the two terms are usually considered to be equivalent). The heat spike cools down to the ambient temperature in 1–100 ps, so the "temperature" here does not correspond to thermodynamic equilibrium temperature. However, it has been shown that after about 3 lattice vibrations, the kinetic energy distribution of the atoms in a heat spike has the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]],&lt;ref name="Dia87"&gt;

In many cases, the same irradiation condition is a combination of linear cascades and heat spikes. For example, 10 MeV [[copper|Cu]] ions bombarding Cu would initially move in the lattice in a linear cascade regime, since the nuclear [[stopping power (particle radiation)|stopping power]] is low. But once the Cu ion would slow down enough, the nuclear stopping power would increase and a heat spike would be produced. Moreover, many of the primary and secondary recoils of the incoming ions would likely have energies in the keV range and thus produce a heat spike.

For instance, for copper irradiation of copper, recoil energies of around 5–20 keV are almost guaranteed to produce heat spikes.&lt;ref name="Ade00"&gt;

At much higher energies, the Cu ions would most likely lead initially to a linear cascade, but the recoils could lead to heat spikes, as would the initial ion once it has slowed down enough. The concept ''subcascade breakdown threshold energy'' signifies the energy above which a recoil in a material is likely to produce several isolated heat spikes rather than a single dense one.

==Time scale==
To understand the nature of collision cascade, it is very important to know the associated time scale. The ballistic phase of the cascade, when the initial ion/recoil and its primary and lower-order recoils have energies well above the [[threshold displacement energy]], typically lasts 0.1– 0.5 ps. If a heat spike is formed, it can live for some 1–100 ps until the spike temperature has cooled down essentially to the ambient temperature.&lt;ref name="Stu99"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooling down of the cascade occurs via lattice heat conductivity and by electronic heat conductivity after the hot ionic subsystem has heated up the electronic one via [[electron-phonon coupling]]. Unfortunately the rate of electron-phonon coupling from the hot and disordered ionic system is not well known, as it can not be treated equally to the fairly well known process of transfer of heat from hot electrons to an intact crystal structure.&lt;ref name="Kop93"&gt;

===Damage production===
Since the kinetic energies in a cascade can be very high, it can drive the material locally far outside thermodynamic equilibrium. Typically this results in [[Crystallographic defect|defect]] production. The defects can be, e.g., [[crystallographic defect|point defects]] such as 
[[crystallographic defect|Frenkel pairs]], ordered or disordered [[dislocation]] loops, stacking faults,&lt;ref name="Nor99"&gt;

The defects production can be harmful, such as in nuclear fission and fusion reactors where the neutrons slowly degrade the mechanical properties of the materials, or a useful and desired materials modification effect, e.g., when ions are introduced into [[semiconductor]] [[quantum well]] structures to speed up the operation of a laser.&lt;ref&gt;

A curious feature of collision cascades is that the final amount of damage produced may be much less than the number of atoms initially affected by the heat spikes.  Especially in pure metals, the final damage production after the heat spike phase can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of atoms displaced in the spike.&lt;ref name="Ave98" /&gt; On the other hand, in semiconductors and other covalently bonded materials the damage production is usually similar to the number of displaced atoms.&lt;ref name="Ave98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nor97f" /&gt; Ionic materials can behave like either metals or semiconductors with respect to the fraction of damage recombined.&lt;ref name="Trach04"&gt;

A '''crystal''' or '''crystalline solid''' is a [[solid]] material whose constituents (such as [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, or [[ion]]s) are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a [[crystal lattice]] that extends in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chem1 online textbook—States of matter |url=http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/states/states.html#SEC4 |author=Stephen Lower |accessdate=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Ashcroft and Mermin |title=Solid state physics |year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, macroscopic [[single crystal]]s are usually identifiable by their geometrical shape, consisting of flat [[face (geometry)|faces]] with specific, characteristic orientations.

Examples of large crystals include [[snowflake]]s, [[diamond]]s, and [[table salt]]. Most inorganic solids are not crystals but [[polycrystal]]s, i.e. many microscopic crystals fused together into a single solid. Examples of polycrystals include most [[metals]], rocks, [[ceramics]], and [[ice]]. A third category of solids is [[amorphous solid]]s, where the atoms have no periodic structure whatsoever. Examples of amorphous solids include [[glass]], [[wax]], and many [[plastic]]s.

Despite the name, [[lead glass|lead crystal, crystal glass]], and related products are ''not'' crystals, but rather types of glass, i.e. amorphous solids.

{{Main article|Crystal structure}}
The scientific definition of a "crystal" is based on the microscopic arrangement of atoms inside it, called the [[crystal structure]]. A crystal is a solid where the atoms form a periodic arrangement. ([[Quasicrystal]]s are an exception, see [[#Quasicrystals|below]].)

Not all solids are crystals. For example, when liquid water starts freezing, the phase change begins with small ice crystals that grow until they fuse, forming a ''[[polycrystalline]]'' structure. In the final block of ice, each of the small crystals (called "[[crystallite]]s" or "grains") is a true crystal with a periodic arrangement of atoms, but the whole polycrystal does ''not'' have a periodic arrangement of atoms, because the periodic pattern is broken at the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]]. Most macroscopic [[inorganic]] solids are polycrystalline, including almost all [[metal]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[ice]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], etc. Solids that are neither crystalline nor polycrystalline, such as [[glass]], are called ''[[amorphous solid]]s'', also called [[glass]]y, vitreous, or noncrystalline. These have no periodic order, even microscopically. There are distinct differences between crystalline solids and amorphous solids: most notably, the process of forming a glass does not release the [[latent heat of fusion]], but forming a crystal does.

A crystal structure (an arrangement of atoms in a crystal) is characterized by its ''unit cell'', a small imaginary box containing one or more atoms in a specific spatial arrangement. The unit cells are [[honeycomb (geometry)|stacked]] in three-dimensional space to form the crystal.

The [[crystal structure|symmetry of a crystal]] is constrained by the requirement that the unit cells stack perfectly with no gaps. There are 219 possible crystal symmetries, called [[Space group|crystallographic space groups]]. These are grouped into 7 [[crystal system]]s, such as [[cubic crystal system]] (where the crystals may form cubes or rectangular boxes, such as [[halite]] shown at right) or [[hexagonal crystal system]] (where the crystals may form hexagons, such as [[Ice Ih|ordinary water ice]]).

== Crystal faces and shapes ==
[[File:Crystal facet formation.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|As a [[halite]] crystal is growing, new atoms can very easily attach to the parts of the surface with rough atomic-scale structure and many [[dangling bonds]]. Therefore, these parts of the crystal grow out very quickly (yellow arrows). Eventually, the whole surface consists of smooth, [[surface energy|stable]] faces, where new atoms cannot as easily attach themselves.]]
Crystals are commonly recognized by their shape, consisting of flat faces with sharp angles. These shape characteristics are not ''necessary'' for a crystal—a crystal is scientifically defined by its microscopic atomic arrangement, not its macroscopic shape—but the characteristic macroscopic shape is often present and easy to see.

[[Euhedral]] crystals are those with obvious, well-formed flat faces. [[Anhedral (petrology)|Anhedral]] crystals do not, usually because the crystal is one grain in a polycrystalline solid.

The flat faces (also called [[facet]]s) of a [[euhedral]] crystal are oriented in a specific way relative to the underlying [[crystal structure|atomic arrangement of the crystal]]: they are [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] of relatively low [[Miller index]].&lt;ref&gt;''The surface science of metal oxides'', by Victor E. Henrich, P. A. Cox, page 28, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X6x1MmPisKkC&amp;pg=PA2 google books link]&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs because some surface orientations are more stable than others (lower [[surface energy]]). As a crystal grows, new atoms attach easily to the rougher and less stable parts of the surface, but less easily to the flat, stable surfaces. Therefore, the flat surfaces tend to grow larger and smoother, until the whole crystal surface consists of these plane surfaces. (See diagram on right.)

One of the oldest techniques in the science of [[crystallography]] consists of measuring the three-dimensional orientations of the faces of a crystal, and using them to infer the underlying [[crystal system|crystal symmetry]].

A [[Crystal habit|crystal's habit]] is its visible external shape. This is determined by the [[crystal structure]] (which restricts the possible facet orientations), the specific crystal chemistry and bonding (which may favor some facet types over others), and the conditions under which the crystal formed.

== Occurrence in nature ==
[[File:Ice crystals.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ice]] crystals]]
[[File:CalciteEchinosphaerites.jpg|thumb|[[Fossil]] [[Animal shell|shell]] with [[calcite]] crystals]]

=== Rocks ===
By volume and weight, the largest concentrations of crystals in the Earth are part of its solid [[bedrock]]. Crystals found in rocks typically range in size from a fraction of a millimetre to several centimetres across, although exceptionally large crystals are occasionally found.  {{As of|1999}}, the world's largest known naturally occurring crystal is a crystal of [[beryl]] from Malakialina, [[Madagascar]], {{convert|18|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}} in diameter, and weighing {{convert|380,000|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;G. Cressey and I. F. Mercer, (1999) ''Crystals'', London, Natural History Museum, page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Some crystals have formed by [[magmatic]] and [[metamorphic]] processes, giving origin to large masses of crystalline [[rock (geology)|rock]]. The vast majority of [[igneous rocks]] are formed from molten magma and the degree of crystallization depends primarily on the conditions under which they solidified. Such rocks as [[granite]], which have cooled very slowly and under great pressures, have completely crystallized; but many kinds of [[lava]] were poured out at the surface and cooled very rapidly, and in this latter group a small amount of amorphous or [[glass]]y matter is common. Other crystalline rocks, the metamorphic rocks such as [[marble]]s, [[mica-schist]]s and [[quartzite]]s, are recrystallized. This means that they were at first fragmental rocks like [[limestone]], [[shale]] and [[sandstone]] and have never been in a [[molten]] condition nor entirely in solution, but the high temperature and pressure conditions of [[metamorphism]] have acted on them by erasing their original structures and inducing recrystallization in the solid state.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Petrology |volume=21 |first=John Smith |last=Flett|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rock crystals have formed out of precipitation from fluids, commonly water, to form [[druse (geology)|druses]] or [[quartz]] veins.
The [[evaporite]]s such as [[halite]], [[gypsum]] and some limestones have been deposited from aqueous solution, mostly owing to [[evaporation]] in arid climates.

=== Ice ===
Water-based [[ice]] in the form of [[snow]], [[sea ice]] and [[glacier]]s is a very common manifestation of crystalline or polycrystalline matter on Earth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} A single [[snowflake]] is a single crystal or a collection of crystals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jY9ADAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=snowflake+is+usually+single+crystal#v=onepage&amp;q=snowflake%20is%20usually%20single%20crystal&amp;f=false|title=The Snowflake: Winter's Frozen Artistry|last=Libbrecht|first=Kenneth|last2=Wing|first2=Rachel|date=2015-09-01|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=9781627887335|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; while an [[ice cube]] is a [[polycrystal]].

=== Organigenic crystals ===
Many living [[organisms]] are able to produce crystals, for example [[calcite]] and [[aragonite]] in the case of most [[mollusc]]s or [[hydroxylapatite]] in the case of [[vertebrate]]s.

== Polymorphism and allotropy ==
{{Main article|Polymorphism (materials science)|Allotropy}}
The same group of atoms can often solidify in many different ways. [[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]] is the ability of a solid to exist in more than one crystal form. For example, water [[ice]] is ordinarily found in the hexagonal form [[Ice Ih|Ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]], but can also exist as the cubic [[ice Ic|Ice I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]], the [[rhombohedral]] [[ice II]], and many other forms. The different polymorphs are usually called different ''[[Phase (matter)|phases]]''.

In addition, the same atoms may be able to form noncrystalline [[Phase (matter)|phases]]. For example, water can also form [[amorphous ice]], while SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can form both [[fused silica]] (an amorphous glass) and [[quartz]] (a crystal). Likewise, if a substance can form crystals, it can also form polycrystals.

For pure chemical elements, polymorphism is known as [[allotropy]]. For example, [[diamond]] and [[graphite]] are two crystalline forms of [[carbon]], while [[amorphous carbon]] is a noncrystalline form. Polymorphs, despite having the same atoms, may have wildly different properties. For example, diamond is among the hardest substances known, while graphite is so soft that it is used as a lubricant.

[[Polyamorphism]] is a similar phenomenon where the same atoms can exist in more than one [[amorphous solid]] form.

== Crystallization ==
{{Main article|Crystallization|Crystal growth}}
[[File:1-cooling-crystallizer-schladen.JPG|thumb|upright|Vertical [[Crystallization|cooling crystallizer]] in a beet sugar factory.]]
Crystallization is the process of forming a crystalline structure from a fluid or from materials dissolved in a fluid. (More rarely, crystals may be [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposited]] directly from gas; see [[thin-film deposition]] and [[epitaxy]].)

Crystallization is a complex and extensively-studied field, because depending on the conditions, a single fluid can solidify into many different possible forms. It can form a [[single crystal]], perhaps with various possible [[phase (matter)|phases]], [[stoichiometry|stoichiometries]], impurities, [[Crystallographic defect|defects]], and [[crystal habit|habits]]. Or, it can form a [[polycrystal]], with various possibilities for the size, arrangement, orientation, and phase of its grains. The final form of the solid is determined by the conditions under which the fluid is being solidified, such as the chemistry of the fluid, the [[ambient pressure]], the [[temperature]], and the speed with which all these parameters are changing.

Specific industrial techniques to produce large single crystals (called ''[[boule (crystal)|boules]]'') include the [[Czochralski process]] and the [[Bridgman technique]]. Other less exotic methods of crystallization may be used, depending on the physical properties of the substance, including [[hydrothermal synthesis]], [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], or simply [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|solvent-based crystallization]].

Large single crystals can be created by geological processes. For example, [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]] crystals in excess of 10 [[meter]]s are found in the [[Cave of the Crystals]] in Naica, Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/crystal-giants/shea-text|title=Cave of Crystal Giants — National Geographic Magazine|work=nationalgeographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more details on geological crystal formation, see [[#Rocks|above]].

Crystals can also be formed by biological processes, see [[#Organigenic crystals|above]]. Conversely, some organisms have special techniques to ''prevent'' crystallization from occurring, such as [[antifreeze protein]]s.

== Defects, impurities, and twinning ==
{{Main article|Crystallographic defect|Impurity|Crystal twinning|Mosaicity}}
[[File:Vector de Burgers.PNG|upright|thumb|left|Two types of crystallographic defects. &lt;u&gt;Top right:&lt;/u&gt; [[edge dislocation]]. &lt;u&gt;Bottom right:&lt;/u&gt; [[screw dislocation]].]]
An ''ideal'' crystal has every atom in a perfect, exactly repeating pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9fRt0TTYUTgC&amp;q=%22ideal+crystal%22+has+every+atom+in+a+perfect,+exactly+repeating+pattern&amp;dq=%22ideal+crystal%22+has+every+atom+in+a+perfect,+exactly+repeating+pattern|title=Report of the Council|last=Britain)|first=Science Research Council (Great|date=1972|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in reality, most crystalline materials have a variety of [[crystallographic defect]]s, places where the crystal's pattern is interrupted. The types and structures of these defects may have a profound effect on the properties of the materials.

A few examples of crystallographic defects include [[vacancy defect]]s (an empty space where an atom should fit), [[interstitial defect]]s (an extra atom squeezed in where it does not fit), and [[dislocation]]s (see figure at right). Dislocations are especially important in [[materials science]], because they help determine the [[Strength of materials|mechanical strength of materials]].

Another common type of crystallographic defect is an [[impurity]], meaning that the "wrong" type of atom is present in a crystal. For example, a perfect crystal of [[diamond]] would only contain [[carbon]] atoms, but a real crystal might perhaps contain a few [[boron]] atoms as well. These boron impurities change the [[diamond color|diamond's color]] to slightly blue. Likewise, the only difference between [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]] is the type of impurities present in a [[corundum]] crystal.

[[File:Pyrite 60608.jpg|thumb|[[Crystal twinning|Twinned]] [[pyrite]] crystal group.]]
In [[semiconductor]]s, a special type of impurity, called a [[dopant]], drastically changes the crystal's electrical properties. [[Semiconductor device]]s, such as [[transistor]]s, are made possible largely by putting different semiconductor dopants into different places, in specific patterns.

[[Crystal twinning|Twinning]] is a phenomenon somewhere between a crystallographic defect and a [[grain boundary]]. Like a grain boundary, a twin boundary has different crystal orientations on its two sides. But unlike a grain boundary, the orientations are not random, but related in a specific, mirror-image way.

[[Mosaicity]] is a spread of crystal plane orientations. A [[mosaicity|mosaic crystal]] is supposed to consist of smaller crystalline units that are somewhat misaligned with respect to each other.

== Chemical bonds ==
In general, solids can be held together by various types of [[chemical bond]]s, such as [[metallic bond]]s, [[ionic bond]]s, [[covalent bond]]s, [[van der Waals bond]]s, and others. None of these are necessarily crystalline or non-crystalline. However, there are some general trends as follows.

[[Metal]]s are almost always polycrystalline, though there are exceptions like [[amorphous metal]] and single-crystal metals. The latter are grown synthetically. (A microscopically-small piece of metal may naturally form into a single crystal, but larger pieces generally do not.) [[Ionic compound]] materials are usually crystalline or polycrystalline. In practice, large [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] crystals can be created by solidification of a [[molten]] fluid, or by crystallization out of a solution. [[Covalent bond|Covalently bonded]] solids (sometimes called [[Network covalent bonding|covalent network solids]]) are also very common, notable examples being [[diamond]] and [[quartz]]. Weak [[van der Waals force]]s also help hold together certain crystals, such as crystalline [[molecular solid]]s, as well as the interlayer bonding in [[graphite]]. [[Polymer]] materials generally will form crystalline regions, but the lengths of the molecules usually prevent complete crystallization—and sometimes polymers are completely amorphous.

== Quasicrystals ==
[[File:Ho-Mg-ZnQuasicrystal.jpg|thumb|The material [[Holmium–magnesium–zinc quasicrystal|holmium–magnesium–zinc]] (Ho–Mg–Zn) forms [[quasicrystal]]s, which can take on the macroscopic shape of a [[dodecahedron]]. (Only a quasicrystal, not a normal crystal, can take this shape.) The edges are 2&amp;nbsp;mm long.]]
{{Main article|Quasicrystal}}
A [[quasicrystal]] consists of arrays of atoms that are ordered but not strictly periodic. They have many attributes in common with ordinary crystals, such as displaying a discrete pattern in [[x-ray diffraction]], and the ability to form shapes with smooth, flat faces.

Quasicrystals are most famous for their ability to show five-fold symmetry, which is impossible for an ordinary periodic crystal (see [[crystallographic restriction theorem]]).

The [[International Union of Crystallography]] has redefined the term "crystal" to include both ordinary periodic crystals and quasicrystals ("any solid having an essentially discrete [[diffraction]] diagram"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=International Union of Crystallography |year=1992 |title=Report of the Executive Committee for 1991 |journal=Acta Crystallogr. A |volume=48 |issue= 6|pages=922 |doi=10.1107/S0108767392008328|pmc=1826680 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Quasicrystals, first discovered in 1982, are quite rare in practice. Only about 100 solids are known to form quasicrystals, compared to about 400,000 periodic crystals known in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Steurer W.|journal= Z. Kristallogr. |volume=219 |year=2004|pages= 391–446|doi=10.1524/zkri.219.7.391.35643|title=Twenty years of structure research on quasicrystals. Part I. Pentagonal, octagonal, decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystals|issue=7–2004|bibcode = 2004ZK....219..391S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] was awarded to [[Dan Shechtman]] for the discovery of quasicrystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2011/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2011 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special properties from anisotropy ==
{{See also|Crystal optics}}
Crystals can have certain special electrical, optical, and mechanical properties that [[glass]] and [[polycrystal]]s normally cannot. These properties are related to the [[anisotropy]] of the crystal, i.e. the lack of rotational symmetry in its atomic arrangement. One such property is the [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric effect]], where a voltage across the crystal can shrink or stretch it. Another is [[birefringence]], where a double image appears when looking through a crystal. Moreover, various properties of a crystal, including [[electrical conductivity]], [[electrical permittivity]], and [[Young's modulus]], may be different in different directions in a crystal. For example, [[graphite]] crystals consist of a stack of sheets, and although each individual sheet is mechanically very strong, the sheets are rather loosely bound to each other. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the material is quite different depending on the direction of stress.

Not all crystals have all of these properties. Conversely, these properties are not quite exclusive to crystals. They can appear in [[glass]]es or [[polycrystal]]s that have been made [[anisotropic]] by [[Work hardening|working]] or [[stress (mechanics)|stress]]—for example, [[photoelasticity|stress-induced birefringence]].

== Crystallography ==
{{Main article|Crystallography}}
''[[Crystallography]]'' is the science of measuring the [[crystal structure]] (in other words, the atomic arrangement) of a crystal. One widely used crystallography technique is [[X-ray diffraction]]. Large numbers of known crystal structures are stored in [[crystallographic database]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11640">'''DEMO''' ('''DEMOnstration Power Station''') is a proposed [[nuclear fusion]] [[power station]] that is intended to build upon the [[ITER]] experimental nuclear fusion reactor. The objectives of DEMO are usually understood to lie somewhere between those of ITER and a "first of a kind" commercial station, sometimes referred to as [[PROTO (fusion reactor)|PROTO]].

While there is no clear international consensus on exact parameters or scope, the following parameters are often used as a baseline for design studies: DEMO should produce at least 2 [[gigawatt]]s of [[fusion power]] on a continuous basis, and it should produce 25 times as much power as required for breakeven. DEMO's design of 2 to 4 gigawatts of thermal output will be on the scale of a modern [[electric power]] station.&lt;ref name="Fusion for Energy"&gt;{{cite web |website=Fusion for Energy |title=Demonstration Fusion Reactors  |publisher=European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy |url=http://fusionforenergy.europa.eu/3_4_demo_en.htm |accessdate=5 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708082042/http://www.fusionforenergy.europa.eu/3_4_demo_en.htm |archivedate=8 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve its goals, DEMO must have [[Linear#Measurement|linear]] dimensions about
15% larger than ITER, and a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] density about 30% greater than ITER. As a [[prototype]] commercial [[fusion reactor]], DEMO could make fusion energy available by 2033. It is estimated that subsequent commercial fusion reactors could be built for about a quarter of the cost of DEMO.&lt;ref name="ITERorg"&gt;{{cite web |website=The ITER Project |title=Beyond ITER |publisher=Information Services, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory |url=http://www.iter.org/Future-beyond.htm  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107220145/http://www.iter.org/Future-beyond.htm |archivedate=7 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EFDA_Activities"&gt;{{cite web|website=[[European Fusion Development Agreement|EFDA]] |title=Overview of EFDA Activities |publisher=[[European Fusion Development Agreement]] |url=http://www.efda.org/about_efda/downloads/EFDAoverview.ppt |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001123645/http://www.efda.org/about_efda/downloads/EFDAoverview.ppt |archivedate=1 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

The following timetable was presented at the IAEA Fusion Energy Conference in 2004 by [[Christopher Llewellyn Smith]]:&lt;ref name="ITERorg"/&gt;
*Conceptual design is to be complete by 2017
*Engineering design is to be complete by 2024 (after input from ITER D-T tests, and data from [[IFMIF]] - both delayed {{As of|2016|lc=y}})
*The first construction phase is to last from 2024 to 2033
*The first phase of operation is to last from 2033 to 2038
*The station is then to be expanded and updated (e.g. with phase 2 blanket design)
*The second phase of operation is to start in 2040

In 2012 [[European Fusion Development Agreement]] (EFDA) presented a roadmap to fusion power with a plan showing the dependencies of DEMO activities on ITER and IFMIF.&lt;ref name=EFDA-roadmap-2012&gt;[https://www.euro-fusion.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/JG12.356-web.pdf Fusion Electricity - A roadmap to the realisation of fusion energy] EFDA 2012 - 8 missions, ITER, DEMO, project plan with dependencies, ...&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conceptual design to be complete in 2020 &lt;ref name=EFDA-roadmap-2012/&gt;{{rp|63}}
* Engineering design complete, and decision to build, in 2030
* Construction from 2031 to 2043
* Operation from 2044, Electricity generation demonstration 2048

This 2012 roadmap was intended to be updated in 2015 and 2019,&lt;ref name=EFDA-roadmap-2012/&gt;{{rp|49}} but EFDA was superseded by [[EUROfusion]] in 2013 and the roadmap was not further updated. It can be expected the roadmap will be at least 10 years postponed, according to schedule of [[ITER]].

==Technical design==
{{See also|nuclear fusion|fusion power}}
[[File:Deuterium-tritium fusion.svg|thumb|250px|The [[deuterium]]-[[tritium]] (D-T) fusion reaction is considered the most promising for producing [[fusion power]].]]
[[Image:DEMO power plant schematic.jpg|thumb|400px|Schematic of a DEMO nucelar fusion power plant]]
When [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] fuse, the two [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] come together to form a resonant state which splits to form in turn a [[helium]] nucleus (an [[alpha particle]]) and a high-energy [[neutron]].
:{{nuclide|Hydrogen|2}} + {{nuclide|Hydrogen|3}} → {{nuclide|Helium}} + {{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + 17.6 MeV
DEMO will be constructed once designs which solve the many problems of current fusion reactors are engineered. These problems include: containing the plasma fuel at high temperatures, maintaining a great enough density of reacting ions, and capturing high-energy neutrons from the reaction without melting the walls of the reactor.

*The activation energy for fusion is very large because the [[proton]]s in each nucleus strongly repel one another; they are both positively [[Elementary charge|charged]]. In order to fuse, the nuclei must be within 1 [[femtometre]] (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; metres) of each other, where quantum-tunnelling effects permit the parent nuclei to "fuse" together into the resonant state. In principle, some fusion reactions will occur also when beams of deuterons and tritons are accelerated and made to collide head-on, the way particle physics colliders work. However, the probability of elastic scattering (simple deflection of the beams, which will tend to de-focus the beams) is much larger than the fusion cross section (the probability for the nuclei to fuse). Therefore, much more energy would be used to accelerate the beams, than whatever energy would arise from the fusion reactions. The "trick" is to form a quasi-Maxwellian distribution for the deuterons and the tritons, at very high temperatures, where the nuclei in the "tail" of the Maxwellian undergo fusion, while the continuous elastic collisions among the other nuclei (as said, the majority of the events) will not alter the state of the plasma.
*DEMO, a [[Tokamak]] reactor, requires both dense plasma and high temperatures for the fusion reaction to be sustained.
*High [[temperatures]] give the nuclei enough energy to overcome their [[electrostatic repulsion]]. This requires temperatures in the region of 100,000,000&amp;nbsp;[[°C]], and is achieved using energy from various sources, to include [[Ohmic heating]] (from electric currents induced in the plasma), [[microwaves]], [[ion]] beams, or neutral beam injection.
*Containment vessels melt at these temperatures, so the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is to be kept away from the walls using [[magnetic confinement]].

Once fusion has begun, [[Neutron radiation|high-energy neutrons]] at about 160,000,000,000&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]]s will flood out of the plasma along with [[X-rays]], neither being affected by the strong magnetic fields. Since neutrons receive the majority of the energy from the fusion, they will be the reactor's main source of thermal energy output. The ultra-hot helium product at roughly 40,000,000,000&amp;nbsp;kelvins will remain behind (temporarily) to heat the plasma, and must make up for all the loss mechanisms (mostly [[bremsstrahlung]] X-rays from electron collisions) which tend to cool the plasma rather quickly.

*The Tokamak containment vessel will have a lining composed of ceramic or composite tiles containing tubes in which warm liquid [[lithium]] metal will flow, cooling the lining.
*Lithium readily absorbs high-speed neutrons to form helium and tritium, becoming hot in the process.
*This increase in temperature is passed on to another (intermediate) coolant, possibly (pressurized) liquid [[water]] in a sealed, pressurized pipe.
*Heat from the intermediate coolant will be used to boil water in a [[heat exchanger]].
*Steam from the heat exchanger will be used to drive turbines and generators, to create [[electric current]].
*Waste heat energy in excess of the generated electrical energy is dumped into the environment.
*Helium byproduct is the "ash" of this fusion, and will not be allowed to accumulate too much in the plasma.
*Carefully measured amounts of deuterium and tritium are added back into the plasma and heated.
*The lithium is processed to remove the helium and tritium, with the balance recycled to collect more heat and neutrons. (Only a tiny amount of lithium is consumed.)

The DEMO project is planned to build upon and improve the concepts of ITER. Since it is only proposed at this time, many of the details, including heating methods and the method for the capture of high-energy neutrons, are still undetermined.

==Conceptual design==

All aspects of DEMO were discussed in detail in a 2009 document by the Euratom-UKAEA Fusion Association.&lt;ref name=Stork2009&gt;[http://fire.pppl.gov/eu_demo_Stork_FZK%20.pdf DEMO and the Route to Fusion Power, Derek Stork, Euratom-UKAEA Fusion Association, September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
Four conceptual designs PPCS A,B,C,D were studied. Challenges identified included:&lt;ref name=Stork2009/&gt;
* structural materials resistant to the high neutron flux
* large requirements for helium unless high temperature superconductors (e.g. [[Yttrium_barium_copper_oxide|YBCO]]) could be used
* need for high efficiency in the heating and current drive systems.

In the 2012 timeline the conceptual design should be completed in 2020.

== Radioactive waste ==
While fusion reactors like ITER and DEMO will produce neither [[transuranic]] nor [[fission product]] wastes, which together make up the bulk of the [[nuclear waste]]s produced by [[fission reactor]]s, some of the components of the ITER and DEMO reactors will become radioactive due to [[neutron activation|neutrons impinging upon them]]. It is hoped that [[plasma facing material]]s will be developed so that wastes produced in this way will have much shorter [[Half life|half lives]] than the waste from fission reactors, with wastes remaining harmful for less than one century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Development of these materials is the prime purpose of the [[International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility]]. The process of [[Tritium#Production|manufacturing tritium]] currently produces long-lived waste, but both ITER and DEMO will produce their own tritium, dispensing with the fission reactor currently used for this purpose.&lt;ref name="ITER_FusionFuel"&gt;{{cite web |website= [[ITER]] |title = ITER-Fuelling the Fusion Reaction | publisher = [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]]  | url = http://www.iter.org/sci/fusionfuels | accessdate = 2010-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PROTO ==
{{Main|PROTO (fusion reactor)}}
PROTO is a proposal for a beyond-DEMO experiment, part of European Commission long-term strategy for research of fusion energy. PROTO would act as a prototype power station, taking in any remaining technology refinements, and demonstrating electricity generation on a commercial basis. It is only expected after DEMO, beyond 2050, and may or may not be a second part of DEMO/PROTO experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://community.dur.ac.uk/superconductivity.durham/The%20roadmap%20to%20magnetic%20confinement.pdf The roadmap to magnetic confinement fusion, Damian Hampshire] 2008 - Says ITER and IFMIF will be completed in 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''datum reference''' or just '''datum''' is some important part of an object—such as a [[point (geometry)|point]], [[line (geometry)|line]], [[plane (geometry)|plane]], hole, set of holes, or pair of [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]s—that serves as a reference in defining the [[geometry]] of the object and (often) in measuring aspects of the actual geometry to assess how closely they match with the [[real versus nominal value|nominal]] value, which may be an ideal, standard, average, or desired value. For example, on a car's wheel, the [[lug nut]] holes define a [[wikt:bolt circle#Noun|bolt circle]] that is a datum from which the location of the rim can be defined and measured. This matters because the hub and rim need to be [[concentric objects|concentric]] to within close limits (or else the wheel will not roll smoothly). The concept of datums&lt;ref name="plural" group="Note"&gt;The plural of this [[word sense|sense]] of the word ''[[wikt:datum#Noun|datum]]'' is ''datums'' by convention, in contrast with the other senses of the word in which ''[[data]]'' often serves as a plural form.) &lt;/ref&gt; is used in many fields, including [[carpentry]], [[metalworking]], [[needlework]], [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] (GD&amp;T), [[aviation]], [[surveying]], and others. 

==Uses==
In carpentry, an alternative, more common name is "face side" and "face edge". The artisan nominates two straight edges on a workpiece  as the "datum edges", and they are marked accordingly. One convention is to mark the first datum edge with a single slanted line (/) and the second  with double lines (//). For most work, the datum references of the workpiece need to be [[Perpendicular|square]]. If necessary they may be cut, planed or filed to make them so. In subsequent marking out, all measurements are then taken from either of the two datum references.

In aviation, an aircraft is designed to operate within a specified range of weight and (chiefly longitudinal) balance; an airman is responsible for determining these factors for each flight under his or her command.  This requires the calculation of moment for each variable mass in the aircraft (fuel, passengers, cargo, etc.), by multiplying its weight by its distance from a datum reference.  The datum for light airplanes is usually the engine firewall or the tip of the spinner, but in all cases it is a fixed plane perpendicular to the aircraft's longitudinal axis, and specified in its operating handbook.

==Engineering== 

An engineering datum used in [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] is a feature on an object used to create a reference system for [[measurement]].&lt;ref&gt;ANSI Y14.5M ({{ISBN|0-7918-2223-0}}) for engineering datums.&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[engineering]] and [[Engineering drawing|drafting]], a ''datum'' is a reference point, surface, or axis on an object against which measurements are made.

:&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle\Box}\!\!\!\!{\scriptstyle\mathsf{A}}\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\blacktriangleleft\!\!\!|&lt;/math&gt;

These are then referred to by one or more 'datum references' which indicate measurements that should be made with respect to the corresponding datum feature .

In [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]], datum reference frames are typically [[Three-dimensional space|3D]].  Datum reference frames are used as part of the [[feature control frame]] to show where the measurement is taken from.  A typical datum reference frame is made up of three planes.  For example, the three planes could be one "face side" and two "datum edges". These three planes are marked A, B and C, where A is the face side, B is the first datum edge, and C is the second datum edge. In this case, the datum reference frame is A/B/C. A/B/C is shown at the end of feature control frame to show from where the measurement is taken. (See the ASME standard Y14.5M-2009 for more examples and material modifiers.)

The engineer selects A/B/C based on the dimensional function of the part. The datums should be functional per the ASME standard. Typically, a part is required to fit with other parts. So, the functional datums are chosen based on how the part attaches. Note: Typically, the functional datums are not used to manufacture the part. The manufacturing datums are typically different from the functional datums to save cost, improve process speed, and repeatability. A [[tolerance analysis]] may be needed in many cases to convert between the functional datums and the manufacturing datums. Computer software can be purchased for dimensional analysis. A trained engineer is required to run the software.

There are typically 6 [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] that need to be considered by the engineer before choosing which feature is A, B, or C. For this example, A is the primary datum, B is the secondary, and C is the tertiary datum. The primary datum controls the most degrees of freedom. The tertiary datum controls the least degrees of freedom.  For this example, of a block of wood, Datum A controls 3 degrees of freedom, B controls 2 degrees of freedom, and C controls 1 degree of freedom. 3+2+1 = 6, all 6 degrees of freedom are considered.

The 6 degrees of freedom in this example are 3 translation and 3 rotation about the 3D [[coordinate system]]. Datum A controls 3: translation along the Z axis, rotation about the x axis, and rotation about the y axis. Datum B controls 2: translation along the y axis and rotation about the z axis.  Finally, Datum C controls 1 degree of freedom, namely the translation along the x axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dimensioning and tolerancing : engineering drawings and related documentation practices : an international standard.|date=2009|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|location=New York, NY|isbn=0791831922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3219">'''Discotic liquid crystals''' are [[mesophase]]s formed from disc-shaped molecules known as "discotic mesogens". These phases are often also referred to as [[columnar phase]]s.  Discotic mesogens are typically composed of an aromatic core surrounded by flexible alkyl chains. The aromatic cores allow [[Intervalence charge transfer|charge transfer]] in the stacking direction through the π conjugate systems. The charge transfer allows the discotic [[liquid crystal]]s to be electrically semiconductive along the stacking direction.&lt;ref&gt;Laschat, S.; Baro, A.; Steinke, N.; Giesselmann, F.; Hägele, C.; Scalia, G.; Judele, R.; Kapatsina, E.; Sauer, S.; Schreivogel, A.; Tosoni, M.

==Photovoltaic devices==
Discotic liquid crystals have similar potential to the [[Conductive polymer|conducting polymers]] for their use in [[Solar cell|photovoltaic cells]], they have the same technical challenges of low conductivity and sensitivity to UV damage as the polymer designs. However one advantage is the [[self-healing]] properties of the discotic mesogens.&lt;ref&gt;Kreouzis, T.; Donovan, K. J.; Boden, N.; Bushby, R. J.; Lozman, O. R.; Liu, Q. The Journal of [[Chemical physics|Chemical Physics]] 2001, 114, 1797-1802.&lt;/ref&gt; So far the photovoltaic applications have been limited, using a [[perylene]] and [[hexabenzocoronene]] mesogens in a simple two layer systems has only resulted in ~2% power efficiency.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Mende2001" /&gt;

==Organic light emitting diodes==
So far the study into discotic liquid crystals for light emitting diodes are still in its infancy, but there have been some examples produced; a [[triphenylene]] and [[perylene]]-[[mesogen]] combination can be used to make a red LED.&lt;ref name="Seguy2001" /&gt; The [[self-assembly]] properties make them more desirable for manufacturing purposes when producing commercial electronics, than the currently used [[Molecule|small molecule]] crystals in Sony’s new OLED displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/01/08/sonys-1-000-000-1-contrast-ratio-27-inch-oled-hdtv/ |title=Sony's 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio 27-inch OLED HDTV |publisher=Engadget.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also they have the added benefit of the self-healing properties that both the small molecule and the polymers lack as conductors, potentially being beneficial for longevity OLED products.

A '''distribution [[transformer]]''' or '''service transformer''' is a transformer that provides the final [[voltage]] transformation in the [[electric power distribution]] system, stepping down the voltage used in the distribution lines to the level used by the customer. 
The invention of a practical efficient transformer made AC power distribution feasible; a system using distribution transformers was demonstrated as early as 1882.{{sfn|Harlow|2012|p=3-4}}

If mounted on a [[utility pole]], they are called '''pole-mount transformers'''. If the distribution lines are located at ground level or underground, distribution transformers are mounted on concrete pads and locked in steel cases, thus known as a distribution tap [[Padmount transformer|pad-mount transformers]].

Distribution transformers normally have ratings less than 200 [[Volt-ampere|kVA]],{{sfn|Bakshi|2009|p=1-24}} although some national standards can allow for units up to 5000 kVA to be described as distribution transformers.   Since distribution transformers are energized for 24 hours a day (even when they don't carry any load), reducing [[Magnetic core#Core loss|iron loss]]es has an important role in their design. As they usually don't operate at full load, they are designed to have maximum efficiency at lower loads. To have a better efficiency, [[voltage regulation]] in these transformers should be kept to a minimum. Hence they are designed to have small [[leakage reactance]].{{sfn|Bakshi|2009|p=1-25}}

[[File:Jelenia_Góra_-_fotopolska.eu_(218205).jpg|thumb|Distribution substations inside a small tower-like building are common in Europe. Near [[Jelenia Góra]], Poland]]

==Classification==
Distribution transformers are classified into different categories based on certain factors such as:
* Mounting location – pole, pad, underground vault
* Type of insulation – liquid-immersed or dry-type 
* Number of Phases – single-phase or three-phase 
* Voltage class 	
* Basic impulse insulation level (BIL).
[[Image:Budakeszitrafo.JPG|thumb|Two three-phase transformers in Hungary]]
==Use==
Distribution transformers are normally located at a [[service drop]], where wires run from a utility pole or underground power lines to a customer's premises. They are often used for the power supply of facilities outside settlements, such as isolated houses, farmyards or [[pumping station]]s at [[voltage]]s below 30 kV.  Another application is the power supply of the overhead wire of [[railway]]s electrified with AC.  In this case single phase distribution transformers are used.{{sfn|Harlow|2012|p=3-17}}

The number of customers fed by a single distribution transformer varies depending on the number of customers in an area.  Several homes may be fed off a single transformer in urban areas; rural distribution may require one transformer per customer. A large commercial or industrial complex will have multiple distribution transformers.  In urban areas and neighborhoods where the primary distribution lines run underground, [[padmount transformer]]s, transformers in locked metal enclosures mounted on a concreted pad, are used.     Many large buildings have electric service provided at primary distribution voltage. These buildings have customer-owned transformers in the basement for step-down purposes.{{sfn|Harlow|2012|p=3-17}} 

Distribution transformers are also found in the power collector networks of [[wind farm]]s, where they step up power from each wind turbine to connect to a substation that may be several miles (kilometres) distant.{{sfn|Harlow|2012|p=3-10}}

==Connections==

[[File:Pole mounted single-phase transformer cutaway.jpg|thumb|170px|Primary line on the right toward the front and secondary lines in the back of this single-phase transformer]]
[[Image:Pylon transformer in Syria.jpg|thumb|170px|Three phase distribution transformer in Syria]]
Both pole-mount and pad-mount transformers convert the high 'primary' voltage of the overhead or underground distribution lines to the lower 'secondary' voltage of the distribution wires inside the building. The primaries use the [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] system. Main distribution lines always have three wires, while smaller "laterals" (close to the customer) may include one or two phases, used to serve all customers with single-phase power. If three-phase service is desired, one must have a three-phase supply. Primaries provide power at the standard distribution voltages used in the area; these range from as low as 2300 volts to about 35,000 volts depending on local distribution practice and standards; often 11,000 V (50&amp;nbsp;Hz systems) and 13,800 V (60&amp;nbsp;Hz systems) are used but many other voltages are standard.

===Primary===
The high voltage primary windings are brought out to [[Bushing (electrical)|bushings]] on the top of the case.  
*Single phase transformers, generally used in the USA system, are attached to the overhead wires with two different types of connections:
**Wye &amp;ndash; On a wye distribution circuit, a 'wye' or 'phase to neutral' transformer is used. A single phase wye transformer usually has only one bushing on top, connected to one of the three primary phases. The other end of the primary winding is connected to the transformer's case, which is connected to the neutral wire of the wye system, and is also [[ground (electrical)|grounded]]. A wye distribution system is preferred because the transformers present unbalanced loads on the line that cause currents in the neutral wire and are then grounded. But with a delta distribution system the unbalanced loads can cause variations in the voltages on the 3 phase wires.
**Delta &amp;ndash; On a delta distribution circuit, a 'delta' or 'phase to phase' transformer is used. A single phase delta transformer has two bushings on top which are connected to two of the three primary wires, so the voltage across the primary winding is the phase-to-phase voltage. A disadvantage of a delta transformer is if only one of the two primary phases is deenergized, the remaining phase will [[Backfeeding|backfeed]] through the transformer winding into the deenergized phase, which could be a hazard to line workers.
*Transformers providing three-phase secondary power, which are used for residential service in the European system, have three primary windings and are attached to all three primary phase wires. The windings are almost always connected in a 'wye' configuration, with the ends of the three windings connected and grounded.
The transformer is always connected to the primary distribution lines through protective [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] and disconnect [[switch]]es. For pole-mounted transformers this usually takes the form of a '[[Fuse cutout|fused cutout]]'. An electrical fault causes the fuse to melt, and the device drops open to give a visual indication of trouble.  It can also be manually opened while the line is energized by [[lineworker (occupation)|lineworker]]s using insulated [[hot stick]]s. In some cases completely self protected transformers are used, which have a [[circuit breaker]] built in, so a fused cutout isn't needed.

===Secondary===
The low voltage secondary windings are attached to three or four terminals on the transformer's side.  
*In the USA and countries using its system, the secondary is most often the [[split-phase electric power|split-phase]] 120/240 volt system.  The 240 V secondary winding is center-tapped and the center neutral wire is grounded, making the two end conductors "hot" with respect to the center tap. These three wires run down the service drop to the electric meter and [[Electrical service panel|service panel]] inside the building. Connecting a load between either hot wire and the neutral gives 120 volts. Connecting between both hot wires gives 240 volts.
*In Europe and countries using its system, the secondary is often the three phase 400Y/230 system.  There are three 230 V secondary windings, each receiving power from a primary winding attached to one of the primary phases.  One end of each secondary winding is connected to a 'neutral' wire, which is grounded.  The other end of the 3 secondary windings, along with the neutral, are brought down the service drop to the service panel.  230 V loads are connected between any of the three phase wires and the neutral.

Higher secondary voltages, such as 480 volts, are sometimes required for commercial and industrial uses.   Some industrial customers require [[three-phase power]] at secondary voltages.  To provide this, three-phase transformers can be used.  In the US, which uses mostly single phase transformers, three identical single phase transformers are often wired in a ''transformer bank'' in either a wye or delta connection, to create a three phase transformer.

==Construction==
[[Image:Ölgekühlter Transformator ohne Gehäuse.jpg|thumb|170px|Oil-cooled three-phase distribution transformer, similar to one in above photo, with housing off, showing construction.]]

Distribution transformers are made using a core made from laminations of sheet [[steel]] stacked and either glued together with resin or banded together with steel straps. Where large numbers of transformers are made to standard designs, a wound C-shaped core is economic to manufacture.  A steel strip is wrapped around a former, pressed into shape and then cut into two C-shaped halves, which are re-assembled on the copper windings.{{sfn|Harlow|2012|p=3-3}}

The primary coils are wound from enamel coated [[copper]]  or aluminum wire and the high current, low voltage secondaries are wound using a thick ribbon of [[aluminum]] or copper. The windings are insulated with resin-impregnated paper. The entire assembly is baked to cure the resin and then submerged in a [[Powder coating|powder coated]] steel tank which is then filled with [[transformer oil]] (or other insulating liquid), which is inert and non-conductive. The transformer oil cools and insulates the windings, and protects the transformer winding from moisture, which will float on the surface of the oil. The tank is temporarily depressurized to remove any remaining moisture that would cause arcing and is sealed against the weather with a gasket at the top.

Formerly, distribution transformers for indoor use would be filled with a [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCB) liquid. Because these liquids persist in the environment and have adverse effects on animals, they have been banned. Other fire-resistant liquids such as [[silicone]]s are used where a liquid-filled transformer must be used indoors. Certain vegetable oils have been applied as transformer oil; these have the advantage of a high fire point and are completely biodegradable in the environment.{{sfn|Harlow|2012|p=3-5}}

Pole-mounted transformers often include accessories such as surge arresters or protective fuse links. A self-protected transformer includes an internal fuse and surge arrester; other transformers have these components mounted separately outside the tank.{{sfn|Pansini|2005|p=63}} Pole-mounted transformers may have lugs allowing direct mounting to a pole, or may be mounted on crossarms bolted to the pole.  Aerial transformers, larger than around 75 kVA, may be mounted on a platform supported by one or more poles.{{sfn|Pansini|2005|p=61}} A three-phase service may use three identical transformers, one per phase.

Transformers designed for below-grade installation can be designed for periodic submersion in water.{{sfn|Harlow|2012|p=3-9}}

Distribution transformers may include an off-load tap changer to allow slight adjustment of the ratio between primary and secondary voltage, to bring the customer voltage within the desired range on long or heavily loaded lines.

Pad-mounted transformers have secure locked and bolted grounded metal enclosures to discourage unauthorized access to live internal parts.  The enclosure may also include fuses, isolating switches, load-break bushings, and other accessories as described in technical standards. Pad-mounted transformers for distribution systems typically range from around 100 to 2000 kVA, although some larger units are also used.

'''Ecoleasing''' is a system in which goods (mainly from the [[Cradle-to-cradle design|technical cycle]], i.e. appliances, ...) are rented to a client for a certain period of time after which he returns the goods so the company that made it can recycle the materials.

==Terminology==
The term ecoleasing has been used by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]] in their book Cradle_to_Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things.&lt;ref&gt;Term found in Dutch version of the book&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to distinct itself from regular [[Lease|leasing]] in that:

* the operation is similar to regular [[Purchasing|purchasing of goods]], so not requiring a contract to be made up as with leasing
* it is done with appliances and other products used for the household, rather than with land or very expensive products (cars, ...)
* the period of time the product is rented would be about the same as the lifespan of the product, so it can only be rented once before it is taken back by the company to recover the materials (and to create another product with it)

==Examples==
Ecoleasing can for instance be done with TV's. Instead of the consumer purchasing the TV, by ecoleasing it, he is entitled to say 10 000 service hours. After this, he can send the TV back to the company.

==Advantages==
* Since materials are reclaimed, fewer or no materials end up in landfills, or require other forms of waste disposal. As such, it is quite environmental.
* Materials are recovered by which the company can make new products, so the material costs for this new product are much lower for the company.
* Since new products can be made at a lower expense, the sale price of these products can also be comparatively lower than similar products made by the competition (if they use a system of purchasing the goods)

{{Politics of the European Union}}
Although the [[European Union]] has legislated in the area of [[energy policy]] for many years, the concept of introducing a mandatory and comprehensive '''European Union energy policy''' was only approved at the meeting of the informal [[European Council]] on 27 October 2005 at [[Hampton Court]]. The [[Treaty of Lisbon|EU Treaty of Lisbon]] of 2007 legally includes solidarity in matters of energy supply and changes to the energy policy within the EU. Prior to the Treaty of Lisbon, EU energy legislation has been based on the EU authority in the area of the common market and environment. However, in practice many policy competencies in relation to energy remain at national member state level, and progress in policy at European level requires voluntary cooperation by members states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceps.eu/book/eu-energy-policy-under-treaty-lisbon-rules-between-new-policy-and-business-usual |title=EU Energy Policy under the Treaty of Lisbon Rules: Between a new policy and business as usual |last=Braun |first=Jan Frederik |work=Politics and Institutions, EPIN Working Papers|date=24 February 2012 |page=14 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the EU was importing 82% of its [[petroleum|oil]] and 57% of its [[natural gas|gas]], which then made it the world's leading importer of these [[fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In January 2014, the EU agreed to a 40% emissions reduction by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and a 27% renewable energy target. The target is the most ambitious of any region in the world, and is expected to provide 70,000 full-time jobs and cut €33bn in fossil fuel imports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/31/limiting-climate-change-economic-benefits-study-finds Limiting climate change could have huge economic benefits, study finds] Stopping global warming at two degrees would create nearly half a million jobs in Europe and save over a million lives in China, analysis of emissions pledges says, Guardian 31.3.2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Energy Union Strategy is a project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/energy-union/docs/energyunion_en.pdf|title=Energy Union and Climate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; of the [[European Commission]] to coordinate the transformation of European energy supply. It was launched in February 2015, with the aim of providing secure, sustainable, competitive, affordable energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:e27fdb4d-bdce-11e4-bbe1-01aa75ed71a1.0003.03/DOC_1&amp;format=PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Tusk]], President of the [[European Council]], introduced the idea of an energy union when he was Prime Minister of Poland. Eurocommissioner Vice President [[Maroš Šefčovič]] called the Energy Union the biggest energy project since the [[European Coal and Steel Community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/energy/will-eu-states-play-ball-energy-union-312419|title=Will EU states play ball on Energy Union?|work=EurActiv - EU News &amp; policy debates, across languages}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's reliance on Russia for its energy, and the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea by Russia]] have been cited as strong reasons for the importance of this policy.

The European Council concluded on 19{{nbsp}}March 2015 that the EU is committed to building an Energy Union with a forward-looking climate policy on the basis of the Commission's framework strategy, with five priority dimensions:
* Energy security, solidarity and trust
* A fully integrated European [[energy market]]
* Energy efficiency contributing to moderation of demand
* Decarbonising the economy
* Research, innovation and competitiveness.

The strategy includes a minimum 10% electricity interconnection target for all member states by 2020, which the Commission hopes will put downward pressure onto energy prices, reduce the need to build new power plants, reduce the risk of black-outs or other forms of [[electrical grid]] [[instability]], improve the reliability of [[renewable energy]] [[supply (economics)|supply]], and encourage [[market (economics)|market]] [[Economic integration|integration]].&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:a5bfdc21-bdd7-11e4-bbe1-01aa75ed71a1.0003.01/DOC_1&amp;format=PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

EU Member States agreed 25 January 2018 on the Commission's proposal to invest €873 million in clean energy infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-383_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - More growth and jobs: EU invests €873 million in clean energy infrastructure|author=|date=|website=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projects are financed by CEF (Connecting Europe Facility).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-energy|title=CEF Energy - Innovation and Networks Executive Agency - European Commission|author=|date=|website=Innovation and Networks Executive Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* €578 million for the construction of the ''Biscay Gulf France-Spain interconnection'', a 280 km long off-shore section and a French underground land section. This new link will increase the interconnection capacity between both countries from 2.8 GW to 5 GW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4coffshore.com/windfarms/interconnector-biscay-gulf-icid152.html|title=Biscay Gulf Interconnector - 4C Offshore|author=|date=|website=www.4coffshore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* €70 million to construct the ''SüdOstLink'', 580 km of high-voltage cables laid fully underground. The power line will create an urgently needed link between the wind power generated in the north and the consumption centres in the south of Germany.
* €101 million for the ''CyprusGas2EU'' project to provide natural gas to Cyprus.

==Earlier proposals==
The possible principles of Energy Policy for Europe were elaborated at the Commission's [[green paper]] ''A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy'' on 8 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52006DC0105:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 52006DC0105 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the decision to develop a common energy policy, the first proposals, ''Energy for a Changing World'' were published by the [[European Commission]], following a consultation process, on 10 January 2007.

It is claimed that they will lead to a 'post-industrial revolution', or a [[low-carbon economy]], in the European Union, as well as increased competition in the energy markets, improved security of supply, and improved employment prospects. The Commission's proposals have been approved at a meeting of the [[European Council]] on 8 and 9 March 2007.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/23665|title=EU sticks out neck in global climate change battle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key proposals&lt;ref name=policy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52007DC0001:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 52007DC0001 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:

* A cut of at least 20% in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from all [[primary energy]] sources by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels), while pushing for an international agreement to succeed the [[Kyoto Protocol]] aimed at achieving a 30% cut by all developed nations by 2020.
* A cut of up to 95% in carbon emissions from primary energy sources by 2050, compared to 1990 levels.
* A minimum target of 10% for the use of [[biofuel]]s by 2020.
* That the energy supply and generation activities of energy companies should be 'unbundled' from their distribution networks to further increase market competition.
* Improving energy relations with the EU's neighbours, including Russia.
* The development of a European Strategic Energy Technology Plan to develop technologies in areas including renewable energy, [[energy conservation]], [[low-energy building]]s, [[Generation IV reactor|fourth generation nuclear reactor]], [[coal pollution mitigation]], and [[carbon capture and sequestration]] (CCS).
* Developing an [[Africa]]-[[Europe]] Energy partnership, to help Africa 'leap-frog' to low-carbon technologies and to help develop the continent as a sustainable energy supplier.

Many underlying proposals are designed to limit global temperature changes to no more than 2&amp;nbsp;°C above pre-industrial levels,&lt;ref&gt;[http://2008.energyconferencebulgaria.eu/html/?go=press&amp;p=detail&amp;newsId=14 New EU energy plan – more security, less pollution]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, press release by European Commission&lt;/ref&gt; of which 0.8&amp;nbsp;°C has already taken place and another 0.5–0.7&amp;nbsp;°C is already [[Climate commitment|committed]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Geden (2010), [http://swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/comments/2010C19_gdn_ks.pdf What Comes After the Two-Degree Target?], SWP Comments 19&lt;/ref&gt; 2&amp;nbsp;°C is usually seen as the upper temperature limit to avoid '[[Global warming#Defining dangerous global warming|dangerous global warming]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Randalls (2010), [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.62/abstract History of the 2 °C climate target], Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, Volume 1, Issue 4, pp. 598–605, July/August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Due to only minor efforts in global [[Climate change mitigation]] it is highly likely that the world will not be able to reach this particular target. The EU might then not only be forced to accept a less ambitious global target. Because the planned emissions reductions in the European energy sector (95% by 2050) are derived directly from the 2&amp;nbsp;°C target since 2007, the EU will have to revise its energy policy paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Geden (2012), [http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2012_RP01_lpt_prt.pdf#page=19 The End of Climate Policy as We Knew it], SWP Research Paper 2012/RP01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Geden (2012), [http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/fachpublikationen/Paradigm_Shift_EU_Energy_Policy_01.pdf Impending Paradigm Shift.

European Parliament voted in February 2014 in favour of binding 2030 targets on renewables, emissions and energy efficiency: a 40% cut in greenhouse gases, compared with 1990 levels; at least 30% of energy to come from renewable sources; and a 40% improvement in energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/05/european-parliament-votes-renewables-targets European parliament votes for stronger climate targets] The Guardian 5.2.2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current policies==

===SET Plan===
The [[Seventh Framework Programme|FP7]] research program only reserved a moderate amount of funding for energy research, although energy has recently emerged as one of the key issues of the European Union. A large part of FP7 energy funding is also devoted to [[Fusion power|fusion]] research, a technology that will not be able to help meet European [[climate and energy]] objectives until beyond 2050.&lt;ref name=ITER&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iter.org/PROJ/Pages/ITERAndBeyond.aspx |title=ITER &amp; Beyond |publisher=Iter.org |date= |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520151601/http://www.iter.org/PROJ/Pages/ITERAndBeyond.aspx |archivedate=20 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission tried to redress this shortfall with the SET plan.&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/textbase/publications/free_new_Desc.asp?PUBS_ID=2045 |title=International Energy Agency – Energy Publications |publisher=Iea.org |date= |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Steering Group on the implementation of the Strategic Energy Technologies Plan (SET Plan) on 26 June 2008 will set the agenda for an EU energy technology policy.

The climate and energy policy is a choice between [[democracy]] and [[autocracy]]. The choice is one between patronage-based oil-and-gas [[oligarchies]] on the one hand, and adaptive and innovative [[low-carbon economy]] on the other.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/07/eu-energy-strategy-putin-fossil-fuel-autocracy-russia EU energy strategy must counter Putin's fossil fuel-fed autocracy] The role of climate and energy policy in the 'long game' that will play out between Russia and the west has been overlooked, [[The Guardian]] 7 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the requirements of the [[Directive on Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources]], which entered into force in October 2001, the member states are expected to meet "indicative" targets for [[renewable energy]] production. Although there is significant variation in national targets, the average is that 22% of electricity should be generated by renewables by 2010 (compared to 13,9% in 1997). The European Commission has proposed in its Renewable Energy Roadmap21 a binding target of increasing the level of renewable energy in the EU's overall mix from less than 7% today to 20% by 2020.&lt;ref name="roadmap21"&gt;{{cite web | title=Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Renewable Energy Roadmap: Renewable Energies in the 21st century; building a sustainable future – COM(2006) 848 final|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52006DC0848:EN:NOT| accessdate=27 January 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe spent €406 billion in 2011 and €545 billion in 2012 on importing [[fossil fuels]]. This is around three times more than the cost of the [[European Financial Stability Facility#Greek bailout|Greek bailout]] up to 2013. In 2012, wind energy avoided €9.6 billion of fossil fuel costs. [[EWEA]] recommends binding renewable energy target to support in replacing fossil fuels with [[wind energy in Europe]] by providing a stable regulatory framework. In addition, it recommends setting a minimum emission performance standard for all new-build power installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/files/library/publications/reports/Avoiding_fossil_fuel_costs.pdf  Avoiding fossil fuel costs with wind energy] EWEA March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[33rd G8 summit|Heiligendamm Summit]] in June 2007, the [[G8]] acknowledged an EU proposal for an international initiative on energy efficiency tabled in March 2007, and agreed to explore, together with the International Energy Agency, the most effective means to promote energy efficiency internationally. A year later, on 8 June 2008, the G8 countries, China, India, South Korea and the European Community decided to establish the International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation, at the Energy Ministerial meeting hosted by Japan in the frame of the 2008 G8 Presidency, in Aomori.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/380&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=Rapid – Press Releases – EUROPA – The International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC) |publisher=Europa.eu |date=8 June 2008 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buildings===
Buildings account for around 40% of EU energy requirements and have been the focus of several initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/buildings/buildings_en.htm Energy Efficiency in Buildings], European Commission, Directorate-General for Energy and Transport&lt;/ref&gt; From 4 January 2006, the 2002 [[Directive on the energy performance of buildings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0091:EN:NOT |title=Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the energy performance of buildings |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires member states to ensure that new buildings, as well as large existing buildings undergoing refurbishment, meet certain minimum energy requirements. It also requires that all buildings should undergo 'energy certification' prior to sale, and that [[boiler]]s and [[air conditioning]] equipment should be regularly inspected.

[[Carbon dioxide]] emissions from transport have risen rapidly in recent years, from 21% of the total in 1990 to 28% in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mulvey |first=Stephen |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6337057.stm |title=EU car CO2 fight only beginning – |publisher=BBC News  |date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU policies include the voluntary [[ACEA agreement]], signed in 1998, to cut carbon dioxide emissions for new cars sold in Europe to an average of 140&amp;nbsp;grams of {{CO2}}/km by 2008, a 25% cut from the 1995 level. Because the target was unlikely to be met, the European Commission published new proposals in February 2007, requiring a mandatory limit of 130&amp;nbsp;grams of {{CO2}}/km for new cars by 2012, with 'complementary measures' being proposed to achieve the target of 120&amp;nbsp;grams of {{CO2}}/km that had originally been expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/155&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=Commission plans legislative framework to ensure the EU meets its target for cutting CO2 emissions from cars |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bilefsky |first=Dan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/world/europe/06iht-carbon.4494947.html |title=EU to compromise on auto emissions – Europe – International Herald Tribune |work=The New York Times  |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of fuels, the 2001 [[Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport|Biofuels Directive]] requires that 5,75% of all transport fossil fuels (petrol and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]) should be replaced by [[biofuels]] by 31 December 2010, with an intermediate target of 2% by the end of 2005. In February 2007 the European Commission proposed that, from 2011, suppliers will have to reduce [[carbon emissions]] per unit of energy by 1% a year from 2010 levels, to result in a cut of 10% by 2020 Stricter fuel standards to combat climate change and reduce air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/120&amp;type=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - Stricter fuel standards to combat climatechange and reduce air pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further area of energy policy has been in the area of consumer goods, where [[European Union energy label|energy labels]] were introduced to encourage consumers to purchase more energy-efficient appliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32010L0030:EN:NOT |title=Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===External energy relations===
{{Main|Russia in the European energy sector}}
[[Image:RF NG pipestoEU.gif|thumb|upright|180px|left|Many EU members import oil and gas from Russia.]]

Beyond the bounds of the European Union, EU energy policy has included negotiating and developing wider international agreements, such as the [[Energy Charter Treaty]], the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the post-Kyoto regime and a framework agreement on energy efficiency; extension of the EC energy regulatory framework or principles to neighbours ([[Energy Community]], [[Baku Initiative]], [[Euro-Mediterranean Partnership|Euro-Med]] energy cooperation) and the emission trading scheme to global partners; the promotion of research and the use of renewable energy.&lt;ref name=external&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52006DC0590:EN:NOT External energy relations – from principles to action]. Communication from the Commission to the European Council COM(2006) 590 final&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU-Russia energy cooperation will be based on a new comprehensive framework agreement within the post-[[Partnership and Cooperation Agreement]] (PCA), which will be negotiated in 2007. The energy cooperation with other third energy producer and transit countries is facilitated with different tools, such as the PCAs, the existing and foreseen Memorandums of Understanding on Energy Cooperation (with Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Algeria), the Association Agreements with Mediterranean countries, the [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] Action Plans; Euromed energy cooperation; the Baku initiative; and the EU-Norway energy dialogue.&lt;ref name=external/&gt; For the cooperation with African countries, a comprehensive Africa-Europe Energy partnership would be launched at the highest level, with the integration of Europe's Energy and Development Policies.&lt;ref name=policy/&gt;

For ensuring efficient follow-up and coherence in pursuing the initiatives and processes, for sharing information in case of an external energy crisis, and for assisting the EU's early response and reactions in case of energy security threats, the network of energy correspondents in the Member States was established in early 2007. After the Russian-Ukrainian Gas Crisis of 2009 the EU decided that the existing external measures regarding gas supply security should be supplemented by internal provisions for emergency prevention and response, such as enhancing gas storage and network capacity or the development of the technical prerequisites for reverse flow in transit pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/comments/2009C21_gdn_ks.pdf Effective Provisions for Emergency Prevention and Response in the Gas Sector].

== Policies under development ==

Documents leaked in late-2016 reveal that a confidential [[European Union]] impact assessment analyzes four scenarios for paring back the 'priority dispatch' system afforded to renewable generation in many countries.  Priority dispatch is mandated under the [[EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC|Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC]] which expires in 2020.  The assessment concludes that removing priority dispatch could increase carbon emissions by 45{{nbsp}}million to 60{{nbsp}}million tonnes per annum or up to 10%, with the aim of making European energy generators more flexible and cost-competitive.&lt;ref name="neslen-2016"&gt;

== Solar anti-dumping levies  ==
In 2013, a two-year investigation by the [[European Commission]] concluded that [[Solar power in China|Chinese solar panel exporters]] were selling their products in Europe up to 88% below market prices, backed by state subsidies. In response, the [[European Council]] imposed tariffs on solar imported from China at an average rate of 47.6% beginning the 6th June that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-china-court-trade-idUKKBN1671BT|title=EU wins court backing on anti-dumping duties on Chinese solar panels|first=Foo Yun|last=Chee|date=|website=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-22766639|title=EU imposes China solar panel duties|author=|date=4 June 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Commission reviewed these measures in December 2016 and proposed to extend them for two years until March 2019. However, in January 2017, 18 out of 28 EU member states voted in favor of shortening the extension period. In February 2017, the Commission announced its intention to extend its anti-dumping measures for a reduced period of 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pv.energytrend.com/news/EU_to_Shorten_Extension_on_Anti_Dumping_Duties_of_Chinese_Solar_Imports.html|title=EU to Shorten Extension on Anti-Dumping Duties of Chinese Solar Imports_EnergyTrend PV|author=|date=|website=pv.energytrend.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-eu-softens-proposal-on-extension-of-chinese-solar-panel-duties-2017-2|title=EU softens proposal on extension of Chinese solar panel duties|author=|date=|website=businessinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
The European Union is also active in the areas of energy research, development and promotion, via initiatives such as [[CEPHEUS]] (ultra-low energy housing), and programs under the umbrella titles of SAVE (energy saving) [[ALTENER]] (new and renewable energy sources), STEER (transport) and [[COOPENER]] (developing countries).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/intelligent/projects/ Projects], European Commission, Directorate-General for Energy and Transport&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[Fusion for Energy]], the EU is participating in the [[ITER]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fusionforenergy.europa.eu/ |title=Fusion for Energy |publisher=Fusionforenergy.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
In a poll carried out for the European Commission in October and November 2005, 47% of the citizens questioned in the 27 countries of the EU (including the 2 states that joined in 2007) were in favour of taking decisions on key energy policy issues at a European level. 37% favoured national decisions and 8% that they be tackled locally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_247_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 247. Attitudes towards Energy], January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar survey of 29,220 people in March and May 2006 indicated that the balance had changed in favour of national decisions in these areas (42% in favour), with 39% backing EU policy making and 12% preferring local decisions. There was significant national variation with this, with 55% in favour of European level decision making in the Netherlands, but only 15% in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_258_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 258. Energy Issues], November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive public opinion survey was performed in May and June 2006.&lt;ref name=SpecialEurobarometer2007&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_262_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 262]: Energy Technologies: Knowledge, Perception, Measures, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The authors propose following conclusions:
* Energy issues are considered to be important but not at first glance.
* EU citizens perceive great future promise in the use of renewable energies. Despite majority opposition, nuclear energy also has its place in the future [[energy mix]].
* Citizens appear to opt for changing the energy structure, enhancing research and development and guaranteeing the stability of the energy field rather than saving energy as the way to meet energy challenges.
* The possible future consequences of energy issues do not generate deep fears in Europeans’ minds.
* Europeans appear to be fairly familiar with energy issues, although their knowledge seems somewhat vague.
* Energy issues touch everybody and it is therefore hard to distinguish clear groups with differing perceptions. Nevertheless, rough distinction between groups of citizens is sketched.

'''Eno''' is an over-the-counter [[antacid]] brand, produced by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. Its main ingredients are [[sodium bicarbonate]],  and [[citric acid]]; it is sometimes used for cooking, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eno's Fruit Salt|url=http://thequackdoctor.com/index.php/enos-fruit-salt/|publisher=The Quack Doctor|date=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eno - Summary of Product Characteristics at eMC|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/21528|website=Electronic Medicines Compendium|accessdate=2 September 2016|quote=Last updated 1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Eno was first marketed by [[James Crossley Eno]] (1827&amp;ndash;1915).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/James-Eno/6000000001153183118 "James Crossley Eno"]. Geni.&lt;/ref&gt;  Legend says that his idea for the product arose while he was working at the pharmacy of an infirmary in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] where [[Dennis Embleton]] worked, and that Embleton often prescribed an effervescent drink made by mixing sodium bicarbonate and citric acid in water, and that Eno adopted this beverage from Embleton.&lt;ref name=RiseFruitSalt&gt;W. A. Campbell (June, 1966) James Crossley Eno and the Rise of the Health Salts Trade.  University of Newcastle Upon Tyne Medical Gazette 60(3):350  Reprinted as an appendix to W. A. Campbell.

Newcastle upon Tyne July 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Eno opened a pharmacy where he made the mixture in 1852, a year before Embleton came to work at the infirmary, and such [[fruit salt]] mixtures were common at the time.&lt;ref name=RiseFruitSalt/&gt;  

==Marketing==
Eno gave away his branded mixture to sea captains at the port, and in this way Eno's became a brand known around the world. By 1865 he had to move to a bigger facility, and he formally founded the company Eno's "Fruit Salt" Works in 1868.&lt;ref name=RiseFruitSalt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=edited by Colin A.|title=Chemistry, society and environment : a new history of the British chemical industry|date=1999|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780854045990|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryInvest&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkins|first1=Mira|title=The history of foreign investment in the United States, 1914-1945|date=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass|isbn=9780674045187}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|253}} In 1878 Eno moved the business to [[Hatcham]] where the factory employed 50 people by 1884.&lt;ref name=Deptford&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dews|first1=Nathan|title=The History of Deptford|date=1884|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, &amp; Co.|pages=273–274|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XDpFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eno was advertised heavily, as all [[patent medicines]] were at that time.&lt;ref name=RiseFruitSalt/&gt; In 1883 it was advertised as a cure for [[cholera]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kotar|first1=S.L.|last2=Gessler|first2=J.E.|title=Cholera a worldwide history|date=2014|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=9781476613642|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1892 for "keeping blood pure and free from disease", prevention of [[diarrhea]], and many other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=39pMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA870 Advertisement for ENO].  The Sunday Magazine, Collected issues of 1892.  Strahan &amp; Company, p 892.  Quote: "Drawing an Overdraft on the Bank of Life.  Late Hours, Fagged, Unnatural Excitement, Breathing Impure Air, too Rich Food, Alcoholic Drink, Gouty, Rheumatic, and other Blood Poisons, Fevers, Feverish Colds, Influenza, Sleeplessness, Biliousness, Sick Headache, Skin Eruptions, Pimples on the Face, Want of Appetite, Sourness of Stomach, etc. It prevents Diarrhoea, and removes it in the early stages.

TO ALL LEAVING HOME FOR A CHANGE. - Don't go without a bottle of ENO's "FRUIT SALT".  It prevents any over-acid state of the blood. It should be kept in every bedroom, in readiness for any emergency. Be careful to avoid rash acidulated salines, and use ENO's "FRUIT SALT" to prevent the bile becoming too thick and (impure) producing a gummy, viscous, clammy stickiness or adhesiveness in the mucous membrane or the intestinal canal, frequently the pivot of diarrhoea and disease. ENO's "FRUIT SALT" prevents and removes diarrhoea in the early stages. Without such a simple precaution the jeopardy of life is immensely increased. There is no doubt that where it has been taken in the earliest stages of a disease it has in many instances prevented what would otherwise have been a severe illness."&lt;/ref&gt; By 1928 the company had factories in England, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the US; that year the company was acquired by International Proprietaries, a company that had been established by Canadian businessman Harold F.

{{Infobox fluorine}} 
'''Fluorine''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''F''' and [[atomic number]] 9. It is the lightest [[halogen]] and exists as a highly toxic pale yellow [[diatomic molecule|diatomic]] gas at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]]. As the most [[electronegativity|electronegative]] element, it is extremely reactive, as it reacts with almost all other elements, except for helium and neon.

Among the elements, fluorine ranks [[Abundance of the chemical elements|24th in universal abundance and 13th in terrestrial abundance]]. [[Fluorite]], the primary mineral source of fluorine which gave the element its name, was first described in 1529; as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for [[smelting]], the Latin verb ''{{lang|la|fluo}}'' meaning "flow" gave the mineral its name. Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts. Only in 1886 did French chemist [[Henri Moissan]] isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature [[electrolysis]], a process still employed for modern production. Industrial production of fluorine gas for [[uranium enrichment]], its largest application, began during the [[Manhattan Project]] in [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].

Owing to the expense of refining pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in [[steelmaking]]. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive [[hydrogen fluoride]] en route to various organic fluorides, or into [[cryolite]] which plays a key role in [[Hall–Héroult process|aluminium refining]]. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as [[refrigerant]]s, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as [[polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as [[atorvastatin]] and [[fluoxetine]] also contain fluorine, and the [[fluoride|fluoride ion]] inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in [[toothpaste]] and [[water fluoridation]]. [[fluorochemical industry|Global fluorochemical]] sales amount to more than [[United States dollar|US$]]15 billion a year.

[[Fluorocarbon]] gases are generally [[greenhouse gas]]es with [[global-warming potential]]s 100 to 20,000 times that of [[carbon dioxide]]. [[Organofluorine compound]]s persist in the environment due to the strength of the [[carbon–fluorine bond]]. Fluorine has no known metabolic role in mammals; a few plants synthesize organofluorine poisons that deter herbivores.

==Characteristics==

===Electron configuration===
[[File:Fluorine shielding.svg|alt=Two concentric rings showing valence and non-valence electron shells|Simplified structure of the fluorine atom|left|thumb]]
Fluorine atoms have nine electrons, one fewer than [[neon]], and [[electron configuration]] 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;: two electrons in a filled inner shell and seven in an outer shell requiring one more to be filled.

The [[bond energy]] of [[Compounds of fluorine#Difluorine|difluorine]] is much lower than that of either {{chem|Cl|2}} or {{chem|Br|2}} and similar to the easily cleaved [[peroxide]] bond; this, along with high electronegativity, accounts for fluorine's easy dissociation, high reactivity, and strong bonds to non-fluorine atoms.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=804}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macomber|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HyuogOtzoaYC&amp;pg=PA230 230]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, bonds to other atoms are very strong because of fluorine's high electronegativity.

It combines with metals, nonmetals, [[metalloid]]s, and most noble gases,&lt;ref name="Riedel Kaupp 2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Riedel|Kaupp|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and usually assumes an [[oxidation state]] of −1.{{refn|Fluorine in {{chem|F|2}} is defined to have oxidation state 0.  The unstable species {{chem|F|2|-}} and {{chem|F|3|-}}, which decompose at around 40&amp;nbsp;K, have intermediate oxidation states;{{sfn|Wiberg|Wiberg|Holleman|2001|p=422}} {{chem|F|4|+}} and a few related species are predicted to be stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlöder|Riedel|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}  Fluorine's high electron affinity results in a preference for [[ionic bonding]]; when it forms [[covalent bond]]s, these are polar, and almost always [[single bond|single]].&lt;ref name="NF charge"&gt;{{harvnb|Harbison|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TRMRDXHWX7EC&amp;pg=PA515 515]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The metastable [[boron monofluoride|boron]] and [[nitrogen monofluoride]] have higher-order fluorine bonds, and some [[metal complex]]es use it as a [[bridging ligand]]. [[Hydrogen bonding]] is another possibility.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metals===
{{See also|Fluoride volatility}}
Alkali metals form ionic and highly soluble [[monofluoride]]s; these have the [[Cubic crystal system#Rock-salt structure|cubic arrangement of sodium chloride]] and analogous chlorides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katakuse et al.|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pjFTI5KgMFkC&amp;pg=PA267 267]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2000|pp=420–422}} Alkaline earth [[difluoride]]s possess strong ionic bonds but are insoluble in water,&lt;ref name="dissolve"&gt;{{harvnb|Storer|1864|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KPyLb5f-p4EC&amp;pg=PA278 278–280]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of [[beryllium difluoride]], which also exhibits some covalent character and has a [[silicon dioxide|quartz]]-like structure.&lt;ref name="Beryllium chemistry"&gt;{{harvnb|Walsh|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-GbhmSfyeYC&amp;pg=PA99 99–102], [https://books.google.com/books?id=3-GbhmSfyeYC&amp;pg=PA118 118–119]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rare earth element]]s and many other metals form mostly ionic [[trifluoride]]s.{{sfn|Emeléus|Sharpe|1983|pp=89–97}}&lt;ref name="Crystal chemistry of fluorides"&gt;{{harvnb|Babel|Tressaud|1985|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SaWLysMGF3cC&amp;pg=PA91 91–96]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein et al.|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Covalent bonding first comes to prominence in the [[tetrafluoride]]s: those of zirconium, hafnium&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown et al.|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=DvqwTdVhjMEC&amp;pg=PA144 144]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry 2011 193"&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SFD30BvPBhoC&amp;pg=PA193 193]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and several actinides&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kern et al.|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; are ionic with high melting points,{{sfn|Lide|2004|pp=4.60, 4.76, 4.92, 4.96}}{{refn|{{chem|Zr|F|4}} melts at 932&amp;nbsp;°C (1710&amp;nbsp;°F),{{sfn|Lide|2004|p=4.96}} {{chem|Hf|F|4}} sublimes at 968&amp;nbsp;°C (1774&amp;nbsp;°F),&lt;ref name="Perry 2011 193"/&gt; and {{chem|U|F|4}} melts at 1036&amp;nbsp;°C (1897&amp;nbsp;°F).{{sfn|Lide|2004|p=4.92}}|group="note"}} while those of titanium,{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=964}} vanadium,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|Müller|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and niobium are polymeric,{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=990}} melting or decomposing at no more than 350&amp;nbsp;°C (660&amp;nbsp;°F).{{sfn|Lide|2004|pp=4.72, 4.91, 4.93}} [[Pentafluoride]]s continue this trend with their linear polymers and [[oligomer]]ic complexes.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|pp=561–563}}{{sfn|Emeléus|Sharpe|1983|pp=256–277}}{{sfn|Mackay|Mackay|Henderson|2002|pp=355–356}} Thirteen metal [[hexafluoride]]s are known,{{refn|These thirteen are those of molybdenum, technetium, ruthenium, rhodium, tungsten, rhenium, osmium, iridium, platinum, polonium, uranium, neptunium, and plutonium.|group="note"}} all octahedral, and are mostly volatile solids but for liquid {{chem|link=molybdenum hexafluoride|Mo|F|6}} and {{chem|link=rhenium hexafluoride|Re|F|6}}, and gaseous {{chem|link=tungsten hexafluoride|W|F|6}}.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|loc=(various pages, by metal in respective chapters)}}{{sfn|Lide|2004|pp=4.71, 4.78, 4.92}}&lt;ref name="D_BLOCK_XF6"&gt;{{harvnb|Drews et al.|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhenium heptafluoride]], the only characterized metal [[heptafluoride]], is a low-melting molecular solid with [[pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry]].{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=819}} Metal fluorides with more fluorine atoms are particularly reactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bartlett|1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boiling-points Chalcogen-Halogen.svg|alt=Graph showing water and hydrogen fluoride breaking the trend of lower boiling points for lighter molecules|Boiling points of hydrogen halides and chalcogenides, showing the unusually high values for hydrogen fluoride and water|thumb|right]]
Hydrogen and fluorine combine to yield hydrogen fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than [[hydrogen chloride]].&lt;ref name="Pauling HF hydrogen bonds"&gt;{{harvnb|Pauling|1960|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=L-1K9HmKmUUC&amp;pg=PA454 454–464]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkins HF"&gt;{{harvnb|Atkins|Jones|2007|pp=184–185}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Scientist HF"&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It boils at a much higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is fully [[miscible]] with water.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|pp=812–816}} Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as hydrofluoric acid. Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are [[strong acids|strong]], hydrofluoric acid is a [[weak acid]] at low concentrations.{{sfn|Wiberg|Wiberg|Holleman|2001|p=425}}{{refn|See also the explanation by Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.&lt;ref name="H+"&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|Holliday|1975|pp=328–329}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other reactive nonmetals===

[[File:Chlorine-trifluoride-3D-balls.png|thumb|[[Chlorine trifluoride]], whose corrosive potential ignites asbestos, concrete, sand and other fire retardants{{sfn|Air Products and Chemicals|2004|p=1}}]]
Binary fluorides of metalloids and p-block nonmetals are generally covalent and volatile, with varying reactivities. [[Period 3]] and heavier nonmetals can form [[hypervalent molecule|hypervalent]] fluorides.&lt;ref name=Noury&gt;{{harvnb|Noury|Silvi|Gillespie|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boron trifluoride]] is planar and possesses an incomplete octet. It functions as a [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acid]] and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form [[adduct]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chang|Goldsby|2013|p=706}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbon tetrafluoride]] is tetrahedral and inert;{{refn|Carbon tetrafluoride is formally organic, but is included here rather than in the [[#Organic compounds|organofluorine chemistry section]] – where more complex carbon-fluorine compounds are discussed – for comparison with {{chem|Si|F|4}} and {{chem|Ge|F|4}}.|group="note"}} [[carbon group|its group]] analogues, silicon and germanium tetrafluoride, are also tetrahedral&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|2001|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but behave as Lewis acids.{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2000|p=423}}{{sfn|Wiberg|Wiberg|Holleman|2001|p=897}} The [[pnictogen]]s form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight, although [[nitrogen trifluoride]] resists hydrolysis and is not basic.&lt;ref name="PnFx"&gt;{{harvnb|Raghavan|1998|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pBiS0jc-kWIC&amp;pg=PA164 164–165]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with [[antimony pentafluoride]] the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|pp=561–563}}&lt;ref name=Arsenic&gt;{{harvnb|Godfrey et al.|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vVhpurkfeN4C&amp;pg=PA98 98]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2000|p=432}}

[[Chalcogen]]s have diverse fluorides: unstable difluorides have been reported for oxygen (the only known compound with oxygen in an oxidation state of +2), sulfur, and selenium; tetrafluorides and hexafluorides exist for sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. The latter are stabilized by more fluorine atoms and lighter central atoms, so [[sulfur hexafluoride]] is especially inert.&lt;ref name="(O,S,Se,Te)Fn"&gt;{{harvnb|Murthy|Mehdi Ali|Ashok|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0xl17YU8WzQC&amp;pg=PA180 180–182], [https://books.google.com/books?id=0xl17YU8WzQC&amp;pg=PA206 206–208]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|pp=638–640, 683–689, 767–778}} Chlorine, bromine, and iodine can each form mono-, tri-, and pentafluorides, but only [[iodine heptafluoride]] has been characterized among possible [[interhalogen]] heptafluorides.{{sfn|Wiberg|Wiberg|Holleman|2001|pp=435–436}} Many of them are powerful sources of fluorine atoms, and industrial applications using chlorine trifluoride require precautions similar to those using fluorine.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|pp=828–830}}&lt;ref name=Patnaik&gt;{{harvnb|Patnaik|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-CRRJBVv5d0C&amp;pg=PA478 478–479]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noble gases===
{{main|Noble gas compound}}
[[File:Xenon tetrafluoride crop.gif|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white photo showing transparent crystals in a dish|These xenon tetrafluoride crystals were photographed in 1962. The compound's synthesis, as with xenon hexafluoroplatinate, surprised many chemists.{{sfn|Moeller|Bailar|Kleinberg|1980|p=236}}]]
[[Noble gas]]es, having complete electron shells, defied reaction with other elements until 1962 when [[Neil Bartlett (chemist)|Neil Bartlett]] reported synthesis of [[xenon hexafluoroplatinate]];{{sfn|Wiberg|Wiberg|Holleman|2001|pp=392–393}} [[xenon difluoride]], [[xenon tetrafluoride|tetrafluoride]], [[xenon hexafluoride|hexafluoride]], and multiple oxyfluorides have been isolated since then.{{sfn|Wiberg|Wiberg|Holleman|2001|p=395–397, 400}} Among other noble gases, krypton forms a [[krypton difluoride|difluoride]],{{sfn|Lewars|2008|p=68}} and radon and fluorine generate a solid suspected to be [[radon difluoride]].&lt;ref name=astatineradon&gt;{{harvnb|Pitzer|1993|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CdUVspeIJAYC&amp;pg=PA111 111]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lewars|2008|p=67}} Binary fluorides of lighter noble gases are exceptionally unstable: argon and hydrogen fluoride combine under extreme conditions to give [[argon fluorohydride]].&lt;ref name="Khriachtchev et al. 2000"/&gt; Helium and neon have no long-lived fluorides,&lt;ref name=HeNeCompounds&gt;{{harvnb|Bihary|Chaban|Gerber|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and no neon fluoride has ever been observed;{{sfn|Lewars|2008|p=71}} helium fluorohydride has been detected for milliseconds at high pressures and low temperatures.&lt;ref name="HeNeCompounds"/&gt;

The [[carbon–fluorine bond]] is [[organic chemistry]]'s strongest,&lt;ref name=hagan&gt;{{harvnb|O'Hagan|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and gives stability to organofluorines.{{sfn|Siegemund et al.|2005|p=444}} It is almost non-existent in nature, but is used in artificial compounds. Research in this area is usually driven by commercial applications;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandford|2000|p=455}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the compounds involved are diverse and reflect the complexity inherent in organic chemistry.&lt;ref name="Jstg"/&gt;

====Discrete molecules====
{{main|Fluorocarbon|Perfluorinated compound}}
The substitution of hydrogen atoms in an [[alkane]] by progressively more fluorine atoms gradually alters several properties: melting and boiling points are lowered, density increases, solubility in hydrocarbons decreases and overall stability increases. Perfluorocarbons,{{refn|''Perfluorocarbon'' and ''fluorocarbon'' are [[IUPAC]] synonyms for molecules containing carbon and fluorine only, but in colloquial and commercial contexts the latter term may refer to any carbon- and fluorine-containing molecule, possibly with other elements.|group="note"}} in which all hydrogen atoms are substituted, are insoluble in most organic solvents, reacting at ambient conditions only with sodium in liquid ammonia.{{sfn|Siegemund et al.|2005|pp=451–452}}

The term ''[[perfluorinated compound]]'' is used for what would otherwise be a perfluorocarbon if not for the presence of a [[functional group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barbee|McCormack|Vartanian|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EdzO0aUxDJkC&amp;pg=PA116 116]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|This terminology is imprecise, and ''perfluorinated substance'' is also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Posner et al.|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dthjVAGP-XIC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=%22Perfluorinated+compounds,+hydrocarbons+that+are+fully+fluorinated+except+for+one+functional+group%22 187–190]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} often a [[carboxylic acid]]. These compounds share many properties with perfluorocarbons such as stability and [[hydrophobicity]],&lt;ref name="fluorotelomer"/&gt; while the functional group augments their reactivity, enabling them to adhere to surfaces or act as [[surfactant]]s;&lt;ref name=Salager2002&gt;{{Harvnb|Salager|2002|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluorosurfactant]]s, in particular,  can lower the [[surface tension]] of water more than their hydrocarbon-based analogues. [[Fluorotelomer]]s, which have some unfluorinated carbon atoms near the functional group, are also regarded as perfluorinated.&lt;ref name="fluorotelomer"&gt;{{harvnb|Posner|2011|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polymers====
Polymers exhibit the same stability increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too.{{sfn|Carlson|Scmiegel|2005|p=3}} [[Polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of [[polyethylene]] with [[structural unit]] –{{chem|C|F|2}}–, demonstrates this change as expected, but its very high melting point makes it difficult to mold.{{sfn|Carlson|Scmiegel|2005|pp=3–4}} Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: [[fluorinated ethylene propylene]] replaces some fluorine atoms with [[trifluoromethyl]] groups, [[perfluoroalkoxy alkane]]s do the same with [[trifluoromethoxy]] groups,{{sfn|Carlson|Scmiegel|2005|pp=3–4}} and [[Nafion]] contains perfluoroether side chains capped with [[sulfonic acid]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhoades|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k3AoGn0upf0C&amp;pg=PA2 2]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Okada et al.|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and [[polyvinyl fluoride]] has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.{{sfn|Carlson|Scmiegel|2005|p=4}}

==Production==

===Industrial===
[[File:Fluorine cell room.jpg|thumb|Industrial fluorine cells at [[City of Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]|alt=A machine room]]
Moissan's method is used to produce industrial quantities of fluorine, via the electrolysis of a [[potassium fluoride]]/[[hydrogen fluoride]] mixture: hydrogen and fluoride ions are reduced and oxidized at a steel container [[cathode]] and a carbon block [[anode]], under 8–12&amp;nbsp;volts, to generate hydrogen and fluorine gas respectively.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2000|p=386}} Temperatures are elevated, KF•2HF melting at {{convert|70|Celsius}} and being electrolyzed at {{convert|70|–|130|Celsius}}. KF, which acts as catalyst, is essential since pure HF cannot be electrolyzed.&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"/&gt;{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2000|pp=384–285}}{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|pp=796–797}} Fluorine can be stored in steel cylinders that have passivated interiors, at temperatures below {{convert|200|Celsius}}; otherwise nickel can be used.&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"/&gt;{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2000|pp=384–385}} Regulator valves and pipework are made of nickel, the latter possibly using [[Monel]] instead.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2000|pp=390–391}} Frequent passivation, along with the strict exclusion of water and greases, must be undertaken. In the laboratory, glassware may carry fluorine gas under low pressure and anhydrous conditions;{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2000|pp=390–391}} some sources instead recommend nickel-Monel-PTFE systems.&lt;ref name="Shriver Inorganic"&gt;{{harvnb|Shriver|Atkins|2010|p=427}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical===
While preparing for a 1986 conference to celebrate the centennial of Moissan's achievement, [[Karl O. Christe]] reasoned that chemical fluorine generation should be feasible since some metal fluoride anions have no stable neutral counterparts; their acidification potentially triggers oxidation instead. He devised a method which evolves fluorine at high yield and atmospheric pressure:&lt;ref name='year'&gt;{{harvnb|Christe|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 [[Potassium permanganate|KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2 [[Potassium fluoride|KF]] + 10 [[Hydrogen fluoride|HF]] + 3 [[Hydrogen peroxide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → 2 K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + 3 [[Molecular oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]↑
:2 K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 [[Antimony pentafluoride|SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] → 4 KSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 MnF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑

Christe later commented that the reactants "had been known for more than 100 years and even Moissan could have come up with this scheme."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Christe Research Group|n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 2008, some references still asserted that fluorine was too reactive for any chemical isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carey|2008|page=173}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial applications==
{{Main|Fluorochemical industry}}
Fluorite mining, which supplies most global fluorine, peaked in 1989 when 5.6 million [[metric ton]]s of ore were extracted. Chlorofluorocarbon restrictions lowered this to 3.6 million tons in 1994; production has since been increasing. Around 4.5 million tons of ore and revenue of [[United States dollar|US$]]550 million were generated in 2003; later reports estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales at $15 billion and predicted 2016–18 production figures of 3.5 to 5.9 million tons, and revenue of at least $20 billion.&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"&gt;{{harvnb|Kirsch|2004|pp=3–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2003b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|PRWeb|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bombourg|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|TMR|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Froth flotation]] separates mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion: 60–85% pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97%+ pure acidspar is mainly converted to the key industrial [[chemical intermediate|intermediate]] hydrogen fluoride.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SME mining 2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Fulton|Miller|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zNicdkuulE4C&amp;pg=PA471 471]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Industrial gas}}
At least 17,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons of fluorine are produced each year. It costs only $5–8 per kilogram as uranium or sulfur hexafluoride, but many times more as an element because of handling challenges. Most processes using free fluorine in large amounts employ ''in situ'' generation under [[vertical integration]].{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2000|p=392}}

The largest application of fluorine gas, consuming up to 7,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons annually, is in the preparation of {{chem|UF|6}} for the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. Fluorine is used to fluorinate [[uranium tetrafluoride]], itself formed from uranium dioxide and hydrofluoric acid.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2000|p=392}} Fluorine is monoisotopic, so any mass differences between {{chem|UF|6}} molecules are due to the presence of {{chem|235|U}} or {{chem|238|U}}, enabling uranium enrichment via gaseous diffusion or [[gas centrifuge]].{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2000|p=382}}&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; About 6,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons per year go into producing the inert [[dielectric]] {{chem|SF|6}} for high-voltage transformers and circuit breakers, eliminating the need for hazardous [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s associated with {{nowrap|oil-filled}} devices.{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2000|p=430}} Several fluorine compounds are used in electronics: rhenium and tungsten hexafluoride in [[chemical vapor deposition]], [[tetrafluoromethane]] in [[plasma etching]]{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2000|pp=391–392}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|El-Kareh|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=Wg1SnT6Cb0QC&amp;pg=PA317 317]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arana et al.|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nitrogen trifluoride]] in cleaning equipment.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; Fluorine is also used in the synthesis of organic fluorides, but its reactivity often necessitates conversion first to the gentler {{chem|Cl|F|3}}, {{chem|Br|F|3}}, or {{chem|I|F|5}}, which together allow calibrated fluorination. Fluorinated pharmaceuticals use [[sulfur tetrafluoride]] instead.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

===Inorganic fluorides===
[[File:Hall-Heroult cell schematic.svg|thumb|Aluminium extraction depends critically on cryolite]]
As with other iron alloys, around 3&amp;nbsp;kg (6.5&amp;nbsp;lb) metspar is added to each metric ton of steel; the fluoride ions lower its melting point and [[viscosity]].&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2003a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel [[Pickling (metal)|pickling]], glass etching and [[cracking (chemistry)|alkane cracking]].&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; One-third of HF goes into synthesizing [[sodium hexafluoroaluminate|cryolite]] and [[aluminium trifluoride]], both fluxes in the [[Hall–Héroult process]] for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23&amp;nbsp;kg (51&amp;nbsp;lb) of flux.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Energetics, Inc.|1997|pp=41, 50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with [[sodium fluorosilicate]] used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride.{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2000|p=428}} Other important inorganic fluorides include those of [[cobalt difluoride|cobalt]], [[nickel difluoride|nickel]], and [[ammonium fluoride|ammonium]].&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2000|pp=420–422}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willey|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PrKemPXyXNIC&amp;pg=PA113 113]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic fluorides===
Organofluorides consume over 20% of mined fluorite and over 40% of hydrofluoric acid, with [[#Refrigerant gases|refrigerant gases]] dominating and [[#Fluoropolymers|fluoropolymers]] increasing their market share.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIA f-chem report description"&gt;{{Harvnb|PRWeb|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Surfactants|Surfactants]] are a minor application but generate over $1 billion in annual revenue.&lt;ref name="fluorosurfactant market"&gt;{{harvnb|Renner|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150&amp;nbsp;°C (−240&amp;nbsp;°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through [[Finkelstein reaction|halogen exchange reactions]] such as [[Swarts fluorination]], in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts. [[Electrochemical fluorination]] subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride, and the [[Fowler process]] treats them with solid fluorine carriers like [[cobalt trifluoride]].&lt;ref name="Jstg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|Slinn|Simpson|Woytek|1994|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TRMRDXHWX7EC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91 91–93]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Refrigerant gases====
{{See also|Refrigerant}}
Halogenated refrigerants, termed Freons in informal contexts,{{refn|This DuPont trademark is sometimes further misused for CFCs, HFCs, or HCFCs.||group="note"}} are identified by [[Refrigerant#Refrigerants by class and R-number|R-numbers]] that denote the amount of fluorine, chlorine, carbon, and hydrogen present.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DuPont|2013b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs) like [[trichlorofluoromethane|R-11]], [[dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]], and [[1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane|R-114]] once dominated organofluorines, peaking in production in the 1980s. Used for air conditioning systems, propellants and solvents, their production was below one-tenth of this peak by the early 2000s, after widespread international prohibition.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were designed as replacements; their synthesis consumes more than 90% of the fluorine in the organic industry. Important HCFCs include R-22, [[chlorodifluoromethane]], and [[1,1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane|R-141b]]. The main HFC is [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|R-134a]]&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; with a new type of molecule [[2,3,3,3-Tetrafluoropropene|HFO-1234yf]], a [[Hydrofluoroolefin]] (HFO) coming to prominence owing to its [[global warming potential]] of less than 1% that of HFC-134a.&lt;ref name=HFO&gt;{{harvnb|Walter|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polymers====
[[File:A water droplet DWR-coated surface2 edit1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Shiny spherical drop of water on blue cloth|Fluorosurfactant-treated fabrics are often [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]]]
{{Main|Fluoropolymer}}
About 180,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons of fluoropolymers were produced in 2006 and 2007, generating over $3.5&amp;nbsp;billion revenue per year.&lt;ref name="yearly FP production"&gt;{{harvnb|Buznik|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The global market was estimated at just under $6 billion in 2011 and was predicted to grow by 6.5% per year up to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|PRWeb|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluoropolymers can only be formed by [[polymerization|polymerizing]] free radicals.{{sfn|Carlson|Scmiegel|2005|p=3}}

Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), sometimes called by its DuPont name Teflon,&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"/&gt; represents 60–80% by mass of the world's fluoropolymer production.&lt;ref name="yearly FP production"/&gt; The largest application is in [[electrical insulation]] since PTFE is an excellent [[dielectric]]. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated [[fabric structure|fiberglass cloth]] for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for [[non-stick surface|non-stick cookware]].&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xv420pEC2qMC&amp;pg=PA189 187–194]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored [[synthetic membrane|membrane]] sometimes referred to by the brand name [[Gore-Tex]] and used for rainwear, [[personal protective equipment|protective apparel]], and [[filtration|filters]]; [[PTFE fiber|ePTFE fibers]] may be made into [[seal (mechanical)|seals]] and [[Dust collector|dust filters]].&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"/&gt; Other fluoropolymers, including [[fluorinated ethylene propylene]], mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeBergalis&gt;{{harvnb|DeBergalis|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemically resistant (but expensive) fluorinated [[ionomer]]s are used as electrochemical cell membranes, of which the first and most prominent example is [[Nafion]]. Developed in the 1960s, it was initially deployed as fuel cell material in spacecraft and then replaced mercury-based [[chloralkali process]] cells. Recently, the fuel cell application has reemerged with efforts to install [[proton exchange membrane]] fuel cells into automobiles.&lt;ref name="Fluorinated Ionomers"&gt;{{harvnb|Grot|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=E8H1Hwd5GXUC&amp;pg=PA6 1–10]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Functional Materials"&gt;{{harvnb|Ramkumar|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ep7U5G4O3mQC&amp;pg=PA567 567]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chlor-alkali and chlorate technology"&gt;{{harvnb|Burney|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rtm_bjQd8SUC&amp;pg=PA111 111]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluoroelastomer]]s such as [[Viton]] are [[crosslink]]ed fluoropolymer mixtures mainly used in [[O-ring]]s;&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"/&gt; [[perfluorobutane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) is used as a fire-extinguishing agent.{{sfn|Slye|2012|p=10}}

====Surfactants====
{{Main|Fluorinated surfactant|Durable water repellent}}
Fluorosurfactants are small organofluorine molecules used for repelling water and stains. Although expensive (comparable to pharmaceuticals at $200–2000 per kilogram), they yielded over $1 billion in annual revenues by 2006; [[Scotchgard]] alone generated over $300 million in 2000.&lt;ref name="fluorosurfactant market"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fluorinated surfactants"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kissa|2001|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iAmE8v3bFnUC&amp;pg=PA522 516–551]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ullman fibers"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ullmann|2008|pp=538, 543–547}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorosurfactants are a minority in the overall surfactant market, most of which is taken up by much cheaper hydrocarbon-based products. Applications in [[surfactants in paint|paints]] are burdened by [[compounding]] costs; this use was valued at only $100 million in 2006.&lt;ref name="fluorosurfactant market"/&gt;

====Agrichemicals====
About 30% of [[agrichemical]]s contain fluorine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|ICIS|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; most of them [[herbicide]]s and [[fungicide]]s with a few [[plant hormone|crop regulators]]. Fluorine substitution, usually of a single atom or at most a [[trifluoromethyl]] group, is a robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals: increased biological stay time, membrane crossing, and altering of molecular recognition.&lt;ref name=Theodoridis/&gt; [[Trifluralin]] is a prominent example, with large-scale use in the U.S. as a weedkiller,&lt;ref name=Theodoridis&gt;{{harvnb|Theodoridis|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trifluralin"&gt;{{Harvnb|EPA|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is a suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DG Environment|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sodium monofluoroacetate]] (1080) is a mammalian poison in which two [[acetic acid]] hydrogens are replaced with fluorine and sodium; it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the [[citric acid cycle]]. First synthesized in the late 19th century, it was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th, and was later deployed in its current use. New Zealand, the largest consumer of 1080, uses it to protect [[kiwi]]s from the invasive Australian [[common brushtail possum]].&lt;ref name="Beasley"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beasley|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Europe and the U.S. have banned 1080.&lt;ref name = "Proudfoot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisler|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|American sheep and cattle collars may use 1080 against predators like coyotes.||group="note"}}

{{Main|Fluoride therapy|Water fluoridation|Water fluoridation controversy}}
Population studies from the mid-20th century onwards show [[topical medication|topical]] fluoride reduces [[dental caries]]. This was first attributed to the conversion of tooth enamel [[hydroxyapatite]] into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries.&lt;ref name=Pizzo&gt;{{harvnb|Pizzo|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled [[water supply|public water supply]] fluoridation to fight tooth decay&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|CDC|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans.&lt;ref name=Ripa&gt;{{harvnb|Ripa|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheng Chalmers Sheldon 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Cheng|Chalmers|Sheldon|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children.&lt;ref name=NHMRC&gt;{{harvnb|NHMRC|2007}}; see {{harvnb|Yeung|2008}} for a summary.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign [[dental fluorosis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marya|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NKYy0w1OjJoC&amp;pg=PA343 343]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[water fluoridation controversy|opposition]] still exists on ethical and safety grounds.&lt;ref name="Cheng Chalmers Sheldon 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armfield|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups.&lt;ref name="Dental caries"/&gt; [[Sodium monofluorophosphate]] and sometimes sodium or [[tin(II) fluoride]] are often found in fluoride [[toothpaste]]s, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.&lt;ref name="Dental caries"&gt;{{harvnb|Baelum|Sheiham|Burt|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fZfXWhSmG1UC&amp;pg=PA518 518]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crest continuing ed"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cracher|2012|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceuticals===
[[File:Prozac pills.jpg|thumb|alt=Capsules with "Prozac" and "DISTA" visible|[[Fluoxetine]] capsules]]
Twenty percent of modern pharmaceuticals contain fluorine.&lt;ref name="Emsley 2011 178"&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|2011|p=178}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these, the cholesterol-reducer [[atorvastatin]] (Lipitor), made more revenue than any other drug until it became generic in 2011.&lt;ref name="url_Crain's_2011"&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination asthma prescription [[Seretide]], a top-ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which – [[fluticasone]] – is fluorinated.&lt;ref name=Swinson/&gt; Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon–fluorine bond is very stable.&lt;ref name="Hagmann"&gt;{{harvnb|Hagmann|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorination also increases [[lipophilicity]] because the bond is more hydrophobic than the [[carbon–hydrogen bond]], and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence [[bioavailability]].&lt;ref name=Swinson&gt;{{harvnb|Swinson|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tricyclic antidepressant|Tricyclics]] and other pre-1980s [[antidepressant]]s had several side effects due to their non-selective interference with [[neurotransmitter]]s other than the [[serotonin]] target; the fluorinated [[fluoxetine]] was selective and one of the first to avoid this problem. Many current antidepressants receive this same treatment, including the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s: [[citalopram]], its isomer [[escitalopram]], and [[fluvoxamine]] and [[paroxetine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mitchell|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Duy5_XAD-vgC&amp;pg=PA37 37–39]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Preskorn|1996|loc=[http://www.preskorn.com/books/ssri_s2.html chap. 2]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quinolones]] are artificial [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]]s that are often fluorinated to enhance their effects.

Fluorine-18 is often found in [[radioactive tracer]]s for positron emission tomography, as its half-life of almost two hours is long enough to allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers.&lt;ref name="18F"&gt;{{harvnb|Schmitz et al.|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common tracer is [[fluorodeoxyglucose]]&lt;ref name="18F"/&gt; which, after intravenous injection, is taken up by glucose-requiring tissues such as the brain and most malignant tumors;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bustamante|Pedersen|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[X-ray computed tomography|computer-assisted tomography]] can then be used for detailed imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alavi|Huang|2007|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxygen carriers===
{{see also|Blood substitute|Liquid breathing}}
Liquid fluorocarbons can hold large volumes of oxygen or carbon dioxide, more so than blood, and have attracted attention for their possible uses in artificial blood and in liquid breathing.&lt;ref name="Gabrielet"&gt;{{harvnb|Gabriel et al.|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because fluorocarbons do not normally mix with water, they must be mixed into emulsions (small droplets of perfluorocarbon suspended in water) to be used as blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sarkar|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schimmeyer"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schimmeyer|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One such product, [[Oxycyte]], has been through initial clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davis|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These substances can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports; one cyclist's near death in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gains|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taber|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid breathing (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid, not a water emulsion) include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs.

[[File:Gifblaar.jpg|thumb|The [[gifblaar]] is one of the few organofluorine-synthesizing organisms]]
Fluorine is [[micronutrient|not essential]] for humans or other mammals; small amounts may be beneficial for bone strength, but this has not been definitively established.

{{See also|Chemical burn}}
Hydrofluoric acid is a contact poison with greater hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid even though it is weak: it remains neutral in aqueous solution and thus penetrates tissue faster, whether through inhalation, ingestion or the skin, and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994. It reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to [[hypocalcemia]] and possible death through [[cardiac arrhythmia]].&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;{{harvnb|Blodgett|Suruda|Crouch|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain&lt;ref name=Goldfrank&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoffman et al.|2007|p=1333}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and burns larger than 160&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (25&amp;nbsp;in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) can cause serious systemic toxicity.&lt;ref name="RMTHFE"&gt;{{Harvnb|HSM|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure may not be evident for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may initially be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischman|2001|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PyUSgdZUGr4C&amp;pg=PA458 458–459]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calcium gluconate]] is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions.&lt;ref name="pmid2741315"&gt;{{harvnb|El Saadi et al.|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17091088"&gt;{{harvnb|Roblin et al.|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15461243"&gt;{{harvnb|Hultén et al.|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.&lt;ref name="RMTHFE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zorich|1991|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sdB3KjhWzFQC&amp;pg=PA183 182–183]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluoride ion===

{{See also|Fluoride toxicity}}
Soluble fluorides are moderately toxic: 5–10&amp;nbsp;g sodium fluoride, or 32–64&amp;nbsp;mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, represents a lethal dose for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liteplo et al.|2002|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One-fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects,&lt;ref name="Nochimson"/&gt; and chronic excess consumption may lead to [[skeletal fluorosis]], which affects millions in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name="Nochimson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19305069"&gt;{{harvnb|Reddy|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary [[excretion]]. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.&lt;ref name="Nochimson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shin|Silverberg|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baez|Baez|Marthaler|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, most cases of fluoride poisoning have been caused by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides.&lt;ref name="Augenstein et al. 1991"&gt;{{Harvnb|Augenstein et al.|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste.&lt;ref name="Nochimson"/&gt; Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person.&lt;ref name=Gessner94&gt;{{harvnb|Gessner et al.|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|CDC|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains.&lt;ref name="Augenstein et al. 1991"/&gt; A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shulman|Wells|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental concerns==

===Atmosphere===

It starts with a lot of ozone but by 2060 is all gone.|NASA projection of stratospheric ozone over North America without the Montreal Protocol&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beck|Newman|Schindler|Perkins|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{See also|Ozone depletion|global warming}}
The [[Montreal Protocol]], signed in 1987, set strict regulations on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and [[bromofluorocarbon]]s due to their ozone damaging potential (ODP). The high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant that they were not decomposing until they reached higher altitudes, where liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules.&lt;ref name="UNEP FAQ Ozone"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aucamp|Björn|2010|pp=4–6, 41, 46–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the ban, and early indications of its efficacy, predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crow|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barry|Phillips|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With one-tenth the ODP of CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the current replacements,&lt;ref name="EPA OLP Science"&gt;{{Harvnb|EPA|2013a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030–2040 by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with no chlorine and zero ODP.&lt;ref name="HCFC0"&gt;{{Harvnb|EPA|2013b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries;&lt;ref name="HCFC Elim speedup"&gt;{{harvnb|McCoy|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] had already prohibited one HCFC's production and capped those of two others in 2003.&lt;ref name="HCFC0"/&gt; Fluorocarbon gases are generally [[greenhouse gas]]es with [[global-warming potential]]s (GWPs) of about 100 to 10,000; sulfur hexafluoride has a value of around 20,000.{{sfn|Forster et al.|2007|pp=212–213}} An outlier is [[HFO-1234yf]] which is a new type of refrigerant called a [[Hydrofluoroolefin]] (HFO) and has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1,430 for the current refrigerant standard [[HFC-134a]].&lt;ref name=HFO/&gt;

===Biopersistence===

{{main|Biological aspects of fluorine#Biopersistence|l1=Biopersistence of fluorinated organics}}
Organofluorines exhibit biopersistence due to the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond. [[Perfluoroalkyl acid]]s (PFAAs), which are sparingly water-soluble owing to their acidic functional groups, are noted [[persistent organic pollutant]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Giesy|Kannan|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]] (PFOS) and [[perfluorooctanoic acid]] (PFOA) are most often researched.&lt;ref name="PFOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|EPA|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; PFAAs have been found in trace quantities worldwide from polar bears to humans, with PFOS and PFOA known to reside in breast milk and the blood of newborn babies. A 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil PFAA levels and human activity; there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating, and higher amounts of PFOS were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA.&lt;ref name="PFOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zareitalabad|Siemens|Hamer|Amelung|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the body, PFAAs bind to proteins such as [[serum albumin]]; they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys. Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species, with half-lives of days in rodents, and years in humans.&lt;ref name="PFOA"&gt;{{harvnb|Steenland|Fletcher|Savitz|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"&gt;{{harvnb|Betts|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tox"&gt;{{harvnb|Lau et al.|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; High doses of PFOS and PFOA cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at current exposure levels.&lt;ref name="PFOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tox"/&gt;

[[File:0 joint Bal Seal.jpg|thumb|right|A garter spring inside a rubber seal]]

A '''garter spring''' is a coiled steel [[spring (device)|spring]] that is connected at each end to create a circular shape, and is used in [[oil seal]]s, shaft seals, [[Belt (mechanical)|belt-driven motors]], and [[electrical connector]]s. Compression garter springs exert outward radial forces, while extension garter springs exert inward radial forces. The manufacturing process is not much different from the creation of regular coiled springs, with the addition of joining the ends together. Like most other springs, garter springs are typically manufactured with either [[carbon steel]] or [[stainless steel]] wire.

== Types of Springs ==
=== Compression Springs ===
Compression garter springs are a type of coiled spring that exerts outward radial forces away from the center. They are typically made up of a thick steel wire with large coils; [[compression spring]]s need to be able to handle very large loads while being able to return to their natural extended position. Compression springs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://springipedia.com/compression-stress-spring.asp|title=Compression Spring – Stress and Spring Set|website=springipedia.com|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; store [[potential energy]] when they are compressed (length of spring decreases), and exert [[kinetic energy]] when released. Compression garter springs use this principle to withstand forces acting on it from outside. They may be placed inside a circular object to maintain the object's circular shape. This is similar to squeezing a [[rubber ball]]; the ball will contract when squeezed but will return to its natural state once the external pressure is released.

=== Extension Springs ===
Extension garter springs are on the opposite side of the spring spectrum. Although they are also a type of coiled spring, extension garter springs exert inward radial forces that move toward the center. Extension springs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://springipedia.com/extension-about.asp|title=Extension Springs – About|website=springipedia.com|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; store potential energy in their extended form and want to contract. Thinner wire and a greater number of coils allow extension springs to be able to contract quickly, which is essential when dealing with pressurized fluids and gases. Extension garter springs act against forces from the center, so they may be placed on the outside of a circular object to maintain the object's circular shape. They act similar to a [[bracelet]], which is extended to fit around the hand and then snaps back into shape on the wrist. Extension garter springs are more common than compression garter springs because they use less material (smaller circumference and thinner wire) and they respond to changes quicker and more efficiently.

== Manufacturing ==
=== Process ===
There are four main stages for the production of steel garter springs. The first step is to cut and coil reels of steel wire to produce normal coiled springs. The strength of the spring is proportional to the thickness of the wire. Compression springs are coiled in such a way that the coils are more spaced apart, while extension springs have no space between the coils.

The second step is to join each end of the spring to form the garter spring's unique circular shape. This can be accomplished through a few different ways:
* Interlocking the loops at both ends of the spring.
* Using a short connector with a hook on one end and a loop on the other to attach the loops.
* Reducing the diameter on one end of the spring so that it fits into the other end (nib joint). This is the most common method used. It is crucial to back-wind the spring to prevent twisting tension that could deform the spring.
The third stage is [[heat treating]], which prevents the spring from being too brittle to function. Heat treating involves placing the spring in an oven at high temperature for a predetermined amount of time, and then letting it cool slowly.

The fourth stage is applying the finishing touches to the spring, which may include grinding (flattening the ends of the spring), [[shot peening]] (shooting tiny steel balls at the spring to harden the wire further), setting (permanently fixing the length and pitch of the spring), coating ([[electroplating]] or applying paint or rubber to the surface to prevent corrosion), and packaging.

=== Materials ===
[[Carbon steel]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.keytometals.com/Articles/Art62.htm|title=Classification of Carbon and Low-Alloy Steels :: KEY to METALS Articles|website=www.keytometals.com|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; wire is typically used for garter springs due to its affordable price and usability, in comparison to stainless steel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corrosionclinic.com/corrosion_resources/stainless_steels_why_how_p1.htm|title=Stainless Steels and Alloys: Why Thet Resist Corrosion and How They Fail (Page 1)|website=www.corrosionclinic.com|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon steel&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; springs tend to have very high [[yield (engineering)|yield strengths]], and are able to return to their original shape when temporarily deformed. The carbon content in carbon steel wires range from 0.50 to 0.95 percent. This relatively small amount of [[carbon]] is enough to improve the toughness of the spring. The close proximity to oil and high-pressure engines mean heat treated garter springs are essential for enduring temperatures over 100&amp;nbsp;°C (212&amp;nbsp;°F). However, carbon steel is not suitable for highly corrosive environments; stainless steel&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; would be a more viable option. [[Stainless steel]] differs from carbon steel in the amount of chromium present; stainless steel has between 10.5% to 11% [[chromium]] by mass, while carbon steel has about 1%.

== Applications ==

The '''Greenhouse gas footprint''', or '''GHG footprint''', refers to the amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es that are emitted during the creation of products or services.

Human activities are one of the main causes of greenhouse gas. These increase the [[global warming|earth's temperature]] and are emitted from [[fossil fuel]] usage in electricity and other byproducts of manufacturing. The major effects mainly consist of [[climate change]]s, such as [[extreme weather|extreme]] [[precipitation]] and [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] and [[Effects of global warming on oceans|warming of oceans]]. Climate change has been occurring since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 1820s.  Due to humans' heavy reliance on fossil fuels, energy usage, and constant [[deforestation]], the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is increasing, which makes reducing a greenhouse gas footprint harder to achieve. However, there are several ways to reduce one's greenhouse gas footprint, such as using more [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] household appliances, increase usage of [[fuel efficient]] cars, and saving electricity.

These gases are emitted from [[Fossil fuel|fossil fue]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l usage in electricity, in heat and transportation, as well as being emitted as [[By-product|byproducts]] of manufacturing. The most common GHGs are [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and many [[fluorinated gases]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases|title=Overview of Greenhouse Gases {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OA|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A greenhouse gas footprint is the numerical quantity of these gases that a single entity emits. The calculations can be computed ranging from a single person to the entire world. A GHG footprint can be calculated on the [https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/ US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) website]. After entering data, a number with units of pounds of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be given.

== History ==
[[File:Joseph Fourier.jpg|thumb|156x156px|Joseph Fourier; first to explain climate change]][[File:Arrhenius2.jpg|thumb|128x128px|Svante Arrhenius; believed climate change would take many years|left]]As early as the 1820s the investigation on climate change was in full swing. [[Joseph Fourier]] believed that light from the sun can enter the atmosphere, but cannot leave nearly as easily. He sought to prove that air can absorb the infrared radiation and will be given back to the Earth’s surface. Later in 1859, [[John Tyndall]] discovered that water vapor and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; trap heat waves given by the sun. In 1896, [[Svante Arrhenius]] tried to prove that it would take thousands of years for the industrial production of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to raise the Earth’s temperature 5-6[[Celsius|°C]].  But this idea was met with much skepticism throughout the early 20th century because it was oversimplified. In the mid 20th century, it was concluded that there was a 10% increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the 19th century, which resulted in slight warming. It was at this time that people believed the emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will increase exponentially in the future and the oceans would absorb any surplus of greenhouse gases. In 1956, [[Gilbert Plass|Gilbert N. Plass]] concluded that greenhouse gas emissions will have an effect on the Earth’s temperature and argued that dismissing GHG emissions would be a mistake. Soon after, scientists from all sectors began to work together to figure out the mystery of GHG emissions and their effects. As technology advanced, it was in the 1980s that there was proof of a rise in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. An ice core, captured through drilling, provided clear evidence that carbon dioxide levels have risen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm|title=The Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Effect|website=history.aip.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some production of greenhouse gases is natural, human activity has increased the production substantially. Major industrial sources of greenhouse gasses are power plants, residential buildings, and road transportation, as well as energy industry processes and losses, iron and steel manufacturing, coal mining, and chemical and [[petrochemical]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allianz.com/en/about_us/open-knowledge/topics/environment/articles/140912-fifteen-sources-of-greenhouse-gases.html/#!m1b4621cf-8fa4-421d-91ad-e866c4f65de8|title=15 sources of greenhouse gases - About us {{!}} Allianz|website=www.allianz.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the environment also contribute the increase in greenhouse gas emission such as, [[deforestation]], [[forest degradation]] and land use, livestock, agricultural soils and water, and wastewater. China is the largest contributor of greenhouse gas, causing up 30% of the total emissions. The United States contributes 15%, followed by the EU with 9%, then India with 7%, Russia with 5%, Japan with 4% , and other miscellaneous countries making up the remaining 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data|title=Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OA|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the most prevalent gas, it is not the most damaging. Carbon dioxide is essential to life because animals release it during [[cellular respiration]] when they breathe and plants use it for [[photosynthesis]]. Carbon dioxide is released naturally by decomposition, ocean release and respiration. Humans contribute an increase of carbon dioxide emissions by burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and cement production.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is largely released by coal, oil, and natural gas industries. Although methane is not mass produced like carbon dioxide, it is still very prevalent. Methane is more harmful than carbon dioxide because it traps heat better than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Methane is a main component in natural gas. Recently industries as well as consumers have been using natural gas because they believe that it is better for the environment since it contains less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, this is not the case because methane is actually more harmful to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howarth|first=Robert W.|date=2014-06-01|title=A bridge to nowhere: methane emissions and the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ese3.35/abstract|journal=Energy Science &amp; Engineering|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=47–60|doi=10.1002/ese3.35|issn=2050-0505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is released by fuel combustion, most of which comes from coal fired power plants, agricultural and industrial activities.

Fluorinated gases include hydroflucarbons (HFCs), [[perfluorocarbons]] (PFCs), [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[nitrogen trifluoride]] (NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). These gases have no natural source and are solely products of human activity.  The biggest cause of these sources is the usage of ozone depleting substances; such as [[refrigerant]]s, [[aerosol]], [[propellant]]s, foam blowing agents, solvents, and [[fire retardant]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The production of all of these gases contributes to one's GHG footprint. The more that these gases are produced, the higher the GHG footprint.

== Rise in greenhouse gas over time ==
[[File:Global greenhouse gas emissions by sector, 1990-2005, in carbon dioxide equivalents (EPA, 2010).png|thumb|261x261px|Global greenhouse gas emissions over time]]
Since the Industrial Revolution, greenhouse gas emissions have increased immensely. As of 2017, the carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels are 142%, of what they were pre-industrial revolution. Methane is up 253% and nitrous oxide is 121% of pre-industrial levels. The energy driven consumption of fossil fuels has made GHG emissions rapidly increase, causing the Earth's temperature to rise. In the past 250 years, human activity such as, burning fossil fuels and cutting down carbon-absorbing forests, have contributed greatly to this increase. In the last 25 years alone, emissions have increased by more than 33%, most of which comes from carbon dioxide, accounting for three-fourths of this increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalWarming/page2.php|title=Global Warming : Feature Articles|last=Holli|first=Riebeek,|date=2010-06-03|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions/#the-long-run-history-cumulative-co2|title=CO₂ and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions|work=Our World in Data|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/09/carbon-dioxide-emissions-greenhouse-gases|title=Greenhouse gas emissions rise at fastest rate for 30 years|last=Association|first=Press|date=2014-09-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lifespan of greenhouse gases ==
Different GHGs last different amounts of time in the atmosphere. For example, fluorinated gases can last from a few weeks to a few thousand years in the atmosphere, whereas nitrous oxide can last for over a century. However, methane is somewhere in the middle, lasting a little over a decade. Carbon dioxide's lifespan cannot be calculated exactly because it does not disappear, but is either used by plants or absorbed by the ocean. There is a possibility that some greenhouse gases have been in the atmosphere since the beginning of the twentieth century, when the first signs of an increase of these gases arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/greenhouse-gases|title=Climate Change Indicators: Greenhouse Gases {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OA|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts ==
Greenhouse gases may cause severe and irreversible impacts on people and ecosystems. The warming caused by GHG emissions is effectively irreversible over multi-century time scales. Risks of GHG footprints are evaluated based on the interaction of projected damages in an earth system climate change effected by choice of emission scenarios. A lot of the effects are extreme weather changes, which include, cold winter extremes, increase in annual mean precipitation, and year round reductions in arctic sea ice.  There are a lot of key risks that span over sectors and regions. This includes severe ill-health and disrupted livelihoods, breaking down of infrastructure, and risk loss of ecosystems. The disrupted livelihoods and severe ill-health includes storm surges and coastal and inland flooding. The breaking down of infrastructure includes the networks and critical services. There is also a risk of [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], ecosystem goods, functions, and services.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Changes of weather ===
It is likely that heat waves will occur more often and last longer as a result of climate change and an increase of the carbon cycle. Climate change and the [[carbon cycle]] will be amplified because of GHG emissions. Extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent. The global mean surface temperature change per trillion tonnes of carbon emitted as CO2 is likely in range of .8 to 2.5 degrees Celsius. This is known as a transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:AYool GLODAP del pH.png|thumb|307x307px|Amount that oceans have acidified (more negative is more acidic)]]

=== Changes to the oceans ===
The extreme precipitation will cause the oceans to warm and acidify. The [[Southern Ocean|southern ocean]] will increase the most in temperature. The global mean sea levels will rise due to the extreme precipitation. Near-surface permafrost in high northern latitudes will reduce resulting in sea level rise not being uniform across regions. There will be a rise in about 95% of ocean area. The sea level rise depends on the pathway of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions not only the cumulative total. In some regions, the future sea level will be at an extreme by 2100. 70 percent of coastlines are projected to have sea level change within more or less than 20 percent of global mean.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Climate change 2014.

=== How to reduce GHGs ===

==== Reduction of carbon dioxide ====
In order to decrease CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, the reliance of fossil fuels must be lowered. These fuels are producing lots of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; across all forms of their usage. Alternatively, [[Renewable resource|renewable sources]] are cleaner for the environment. Capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from power plants will also reduce emissions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Household energy conservation measures include increasing insulation in construction, using fuel-efficient vehicles and [[Energy Star|ENERGY STAR]] appliances, and unplugging electrical items when not in use.

==== Reduction of methane ====
Reducing methane emissions can be accomplished in several ways. Capturing CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from coal mines and landfills, are two ways of reducing these emissions. Manure management and livestock operations is another possible solution. Motor vehicles use fossil fuels, which produces CO2, but fossil fuels also produce CH4 as a byproduct. Thus, better technology for these vehicles to avoid leakage would be very beneficial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Reduction of nitrous oxide ====
Nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is often given off as a byproduct in various ways. [[Nylon]] production and fossil fuel usage are two ways that N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is given off as a byproduct. Thus, improving technology for nylon production and the gathering of fossil fuels would greatly reduce nitrous oxide emissions. Also, many fertilizers have a [[nitrogenous base]]. A decrease in usage of these fertilizers, or changing their components, are more ways to reduce N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emissions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Reduction of fluorinated gases ====
Although fluorinated gases are not produced on a massive scale, they have the worst effect on the environment. A reduction of fluorinated gas emissions can be done in many ways. Many industries that emit these gases can capture or recycle them. These same industries can also invest in more advanced technology that will not produce these gases. A reduction of leakage within [[Electrical grid|power grids]] and motor vehicles will also decrease the emissions of fluorinated gases. There are also many air conditioning systems that emit fluorinated gases, thus an update in technology would decrease these emissions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Everyday life changes ===
[[File:GHG by country 2000.svg|thumb|386x386px|Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Country in 2000]]
There are many simple changes that can be made to the everyday lifestyle of a person that would reduce their GHG footprint. Reducing energy consumption within a household can include lowering one’s dependence on air conditioning and heating, using [[Compact fluorescent lamp|CFL light bulbs]], choosing ENERGY STAR appliances, recycling, using cold water to wash clothes, and avoiding a dryer. Another adjustment would be to use a motor vehicle that is fuel-efficient as well as reducing reliance on motor vehicles. Motor vehicles produce many GHGs, thus an adjustment to one’s usage will greatly affect a GHG footprint.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2626">The '''heat deflection temperature''' or '''heat distortion temperature''' '''(HDT, HDTUL, or DTUL)''' is the [[temperature]] at which a [[polymer]] or [[plastic]] sample deforms under a specified load.  This property of a given plastic material is applied in many aspects of product design, engineering and manufacture of products using [[thermoplastic]] components.

==Determination== 
The heat distortion temperature is determined by the following test procedure outlined in ASTM&amp;nbsp;D648. The test specimen is loaded in three-point bending in the edgewise direction. The outer fiber stress used for testing is either 0.455&amp;nbsp;MPa or 1.82&amp;nbsp;MPa, and the temperature is increased at 2&amp;nbsp;°C/min until the specimen deflects 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm. This is similar to the test procedure defined in the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]&amp;nbsp;75 standard.

Limitations that are associated with the determination of the HDT is that the sample is not thermally isotropic and, in thick samples in particular, will contain a temperature gradient. The HDT of a particular material can also be very sensitive to stress experienced by the component which is dependent on the component’s dimensions. The selected deflection of 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm (which is 0.2% additional strain) is selected arbitrarily and has no particular physical significance.

==Application in injection molding==
An injection molded plastic part is considered "safe" to remove from its mold once it is near or below the HDT. This means that part deformation will be held within acceptable limits after removal.  The molding of plastics by necessity occurs at high temperatures (routinely 200&amp;nbsp;°C or higher) due to the low viscosity of plastics in fluid form (this issue can be addressed to some extent by the addition of [[plasticizer]]s to the melt). Once plastic is in the mold, it must be cooled to a temperature to which little or no dimensional change will occur after removal.  In general, plastics do not conduct heat well and so will take quite a while to cool to room temperature. One way to mitigate this is to use a cold mold (thereby increasing heat loss from the part). Even so, the cooling of the part to room temperature can limit the mass production of parts.

Choosing a resin with a higher heat deflection temperature can allow manufacturers to achieve a much faster molding process than they would otherwise while maintaining dimensional changes within certain limits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1842">'''Herbfields''' are plant communities dominated by [[herbaceous plant]]s, especially [[forb]]s and [[grass]]es.  They are found where climatic conditions do not allow large [[woody plant]]s to grow, such as in [[subantarctic]] and [[alpine tundra]] environments.  Herbfield is defined in [[New South Wales]] (Australia) government legislation as native vegetation that predominantly does not contain an [[overstory|over-storey]] or a mid-storey and where ground cover is dominated by non-grass species.&lt;ref&gt;NSW Dept of Environment, Climate Change and Water.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|New Zealand Department of Conservation]] has described herbfield vegetation as that in which the cover of herbs in the canopy is 20–100%, and in which herb cover is greater than that of any other growth form, or of bare ground.&lt;ref&gt;Lux et al. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Various kinds of herbfield include:
* Tall alpine herbfield
* Short alpine herbfield
* Tussock herbfield
* Wet herbfield
* Aquatic herbfield

The '''Kavşaktepe Dam''' is a [[gravity dam]] under construction on the [[Ortasu River]] (a tributary of the [[Hezil River]]) in [[Uludere]] district of [[Şırnak Province]], southeast [[Turkey]]. Under contract from Turkey's [[State Hydraulic Works]], Be-Ha-Se Insaat began construction on the dam in 2008 and a completion date has not been announced.&lt;ref name=DSIII/&gt;

The reported purpose of the dam is water storage and it can also support a 1.57 MW [[hydroelectric]] power station in the future.&lt;ref name=DSIII&gt;{{cite web|title=DSI 10 REGIONAL OFFICE - Diyarbakir|url=http://www2.dsi.gov.tr/bolge/dsi10/sirnak.htm|publisher=State Hydraulic Works|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another purpose of the dam which has been widely reported in the Turkish press is to reduce the freedom of movement of [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) militants. Blocking and flooding valleys in close proximity to the Iraq–Turkey border is expected to help curb cross-border PKK smuggling and deny caves in which ammunition can be stored. A total of 11 dams along the border; seven in Şırnak Province and four in [[Hakkâri Province]] were implemented for this purpose. In Şırnak they are the [[Silopi Dam|Silopi]], [[Şırnak Dam|Şırnak]], [[Uludere Dam|Uludere]] and [[Balli Dam]]s downstream of the Kavşaktepe Dam and the [[Musatepe Dam|Musatepe]] and [[Çetintepe Dam]]s upstream on the Ortasu River. In Hakkari are the Gölgeliyamaç (since cancelled) and [[Çocuktepe Dam]]s on the Güzeldere River and the [[Aslandağ Dam|Aslandağ]] and [[Beyyurdu Dam]]s on the Bembo River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terror Down|url=http://www.posta.com.tr/turkiye/HaberDetay/Teror-bogulacak.htm?ArticleID=136637|publisher=Posta|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planned to be completed in the second dam on the border against the PKK|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/19088520.asp|publisher=Hurriyet|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dams Prevent Smuggling at the Border|url=http://www.aktifhaber.com/sinirdaki-barajlar-kacakciligi-onleyecek-780919h.htm|publisher=Aktif Haber|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=5 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510001959/http://www.aktifhaber.com/sinirdaki-barajlar-kacakciligi-onleyecek-780919h.htm|archivedate=10 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water retention dams began operation against PKK|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/2012/turkiye/08/23/pkkya.karsi.yapilan.barajlarda.su.tutma.islemi.basladi/674002.0/index.html|publisher=CNNTurk|accessdate=2 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lightning rocket''' is a [[rocket]] device, generally about the size of a man,{{cn|date=July 2015}} that trails behind a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], such as a fine [[copper wire]] or other medium that is conductive, to conduct [[lightning]] charges to the ground. Lightning strikes derived from this process are called "triggered lightning."

== Design ==

A conducting [[lightning rod]] which is grounded and positioned alongside the launch tube in communication with the conductive path to thereby control the time and location of a lightning strike from the thundercloud.  The conductor trailed by the rocket can be either a physical wire, or column of ionized gas produced by the engine.  A lightning rocket using solid propellant may have cesium salts added, which produces a conductive path when the exhaust gases are discharged from the rocket.  In a liquid propellant rocket a solution of calcium chloride is used to form the conductive path.

The system consists of a specially designed launch pad with lightning rods and conductors attached.  The launch pad is either controlled wirelessly or via pneumatic line to the control station to prevent the discharge traveling to the control equipment.  The fine copper wire (more recently reinforced with kevlar) is attached to the ground and plays out from the rocket as it ascends.  The initial strike follows this wire and is as a result unusually straight.  As the wire is vaporized by the initial strike subsequent strikes are more angular in nature following the ionization trail of the initial strike.  Rockets of this type are used for both lightning research and lightning control.

== Betts system ==

The Betts ''lightning rocket'', patented by  Robert E. Betts in 2003, consists of a [[rocket]] launcher that is in communication with a detection device that measures the presence of [[electrostatic]] and [[ion]]ic change in close proximity to the rocket launcher that also fires the rocket. This system is designed to control the [[time]] and the [[Location (geography)|location]] of a [[lightning strike]]. As the rocket flies to the thundercloud this liquid is expelled aft forming a column in the air of particles that are more electrically conductive than the surrounding air. In a similar fashion to the system employing a solid propellant as the conductive producer this conductive path conducts a lightning strike to ground to thereby control the time and location of a lightning strike from the thundercloud.

==History==
The Kalwakurthy Lift Irrigation Scheme foundation stone was laid way back in 1984. It was started again in 2005 but delayed again.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/161017/t-harish-rao-slams-congress-td.html&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014 the work started with a spending of ₹2100 crores and completed in October 2017 and water was released by irrigation Minister, [[Harish Rao]]. It took a little over three decades to be completed.&lt;ref&gt;https://telanganatoday.com/telangana-harish-rao-vows-ensure-water-20-lakh-acres&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ayacut==
The original design for the project was 25 TMC water capacity, but later it was increased to 40 TMC to reach the prescribed target. This project provides water to the most drought prone areas in Mahbubnagar. The water is sourced from Krishna river, by lifting water 300 meters above river level and channeling into the reservoir. 

Achampet Branch Canal will be expanded by a length of 14 km, creating an additional ayacut of 15,000 acres (10,000 acres in Uppunuthala mandal and 5,000 acre) in Achampet mandal.

==Reservoirs==
Around 51 balancing reservoirs with 20 TMC water capacity are proposed under MGKLIS for assured water supply to the ayacut. They are scheduled to be completed by June 2019.

The Buddaram Peddavagu Lake is proposed to be converted into a reservoir in 2018. It was conceptualised and conceived way back in 2008, due to delays it is completing in June 2019. With this reservoir, the entire parched lands under Wanaparthy district will get water for irrigation. This would also ensure continuous flow of water

==Water Lifting==
This project has three lifts, first lift in Eluru (Kollapur mandal) second in Jonnalaboguda village and third lift in Gudipally village. There are small reservoirs yet to be constructed to store the water which is lifted from the backwaters of the Srisailam. This project serves water through canals which will fill the lakes of all the villages and towns present in the five constituencies of Mahabubnagar district.

===Pumps===
[[ASEA Brown-Boveri|ABB]] partnered for industrial-strength water pumping technology with [[Andritz AG]], to deploy five of its massive and high-capacity 30-megawatt (MW), 11-kilovolt (kV) motors, each capable of pumping 23,000 litres per second. ABB also supplied substation equipment, transformers, and a digitally-enabled supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) monitoring system that ensures a steady and reliable drawing of power from the grid and smooth pumping of water into the reservoir.

'''Marcel Roche Dugand''' (August 15, 1920 in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]] – May 3, 2003 in [[Miami]], [[United States|USA]]) was a [[physician]], [[scientist]] and scientific leader.

He was born into a wealthy family of [[France|French]] origin. His father, [[Luis Roche]]  was a well known urbanist. His secondary education was conducted in [[Paris]], [[France]], graduating in 1938. Following this, he moved to the USA and got a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at [[Saint Joseph's University|St. Joseph’s College]], in [[Philadelphia]], following by studies in [[medicine]] at [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]], in [[Baltimore]]. After graduation in 1946, he specialized in [[endocrinology]] and [[nuclear medicine]]. Before returning to Venezuela in 1951, he carried out biomedical research for some time at the [[New York Institute of Public Health]]. 

In Venezuela, Dr. Roche started several pioneering works as an Assistant Professor of the [[Central University of Venezuela]] on [[goitre]], [[hookworm]] infections and [[nutritional deficiencies]] and [[anaemia]]s, especially among the poor and [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] people. 

He was founder and director of the Institute of Medical Research at the Central University, and in 1958 he also became the Secretary General of the [[Venezuelan Association for the Advancement of Science]]. Other institutions directed by him were the Institute of Neurology and Brain Investigation, reorganized in 1959 as the [[Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research]] after succeeding Dr. [[Humberto Fernandez Moran]] in 1958. During his tenure, Dr. Roche became interested and supported the development of [[anthropology]] and the study the [[history of science|history]] and [[sociology of science]].

He was founder and director of the [[Venezuelan National Council of Scientific Investigation]] and the magazine [[Intersciencia]], as well as being involved in the publishing of several other scientific periodicals. Dr. Roche was also a pioneer in the area of [[Public awareness of science|public understanding of science]] and a pioneer in the production of [[TV]] programs and [[documentary film]]s on many science subjects. He was very active in promoting science to the public and participated in many national and international organizations promoting science. Dr. Roche was an advisor to the [[World Health Organization]] ([[WHO]]), [[UNESCO]], a Governor of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (1958-1960), and was a Member and President of the Council of the [[University of the United Nations]] in [[Tokyo]], and Secretary of the [[Third World Academy of Sciences]]. 

He received many honours and degrees from [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[France]], the [[United States]], [[India]] and [[Brazil]]. He won the [[Kalinga Prize]] in 1987 from UNESCO for his work.

'''Massicot''' is [[Lead(II) oxide|lead (II)]] [[oxide mineral]] with an [[orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic lattice structure]].

Lead(II) oxide (formula: PbO) can occur in one of two lattice formats, [[orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]] and [[tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]]. The tetragonal form is called [[litharge]]. PbO can be changed from massicot to litharge (or vice versa) by controlled heating and cooling. At room temperature massicot forms soft ([[Mohs hardness]] of 2) yellow to reddish-yellow, earthy, scaley masses which are very dense, with a [[specific gravity]] of 9.64. Massicot can be found as a natural mineral, though it is only found in minor quantities. In bygone centuries it was mined. Nowadays massicot arises during industrial processing of lead and lead oxides,&lt;ref&gt;A simple example is given in [https://books.google.com/books?id=PpTi_JAx7PgC&amp;lpg=PA383&amp;dq=massicot&amp;pg=PA383#v=onepage&amp;f=false ''A Text Book of Inorganic Chemistry''], by Anil Kumar De, year 2007, page 383. A more complex example is in [https://books.google.com/books?id=rPzaMRjK8pQC&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=massicot&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q=massicot&amp;f=false ''The Chemistry of Metal Alkoxides''], published by Kluwer Academic Publishers, year 2002, section 9.4 on lead alkoxides, page 115.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the glass industry, which is the biggest user of PbO.

The definition of massicot as orthorhombic PbO dates from the 1840s,&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; but the substance massicot and the name massicot has been in use since the late medieval era.&lt;ref&gt;Some comments about the evolution of the definition of the word massicot over the past few centuries is in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZL4OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=massicot#v=onepage&amp;q=massicot&amp;f=false ''Lead Manufacturing in Britain: A History''], by David John Rowe, year 1983, page 16. The word is in Italian and French in the late medieval era meaning naturally occurring massicot and in some records more vaguely a lead-based ceramics glaze that may or may not have been massicot.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that the ancient Romans used the substance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7VMVguiMmY0C&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=massicot&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Archaeomineralogy''], by George Robert Rapp, year 2002, page 173, says three lead oxides were known to the ancient Romans: [[Minium (mineral)|minium]], litharge, and massicot.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may occur as an [[oxidation]] product of other lead-bearing minerals such as [[galena]], [[bournonite]], [[boulangerite]], either naturally or in industrial processing. When massicot is found in a natural environment, some other minerals that may be found with it may include [[cerussite]], litharge, [[minium]], [[wulfenite]], oxides of [[antimony]] and [[limonite]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

The '''Neoplan Transliner''' was a series of related [[mass transit|public transport]] [[transit bus|single-decker bus]] models introduced by [[Neoplan USA]] in 1981. It was able to compete with the [[Rapid Transit Series]], [[Flxible Metro]], [[Gillig Phantom]] and the [[Orion I]] in the early 1980s.

== Models ==
The Transliner was available in a wide variety of body styles. The Transliners could be ordered in 26', 30', 35', 40', and 60' lengths. [[High-floor|Standard (high)]], [[Low-floor bus|completely low]], or [[Low-floor bus|semi-low]] (with steps to access the rear section after the rear doors) floors were available.

[[Neoplan USA|NeoPlan]] offered a variety of engines, both [[diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[Compressed Natural Gas|CNG]] fueled. Depending upon the model, [[Detroit Diesel]] 40 or 50 series or the 6V92TA; [[Cummins ISM]], C-series, or [[Cummins ISL|ISL]]; or CAT C-9 engines could also be had. Most Transliners featured [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] B400 or B500 "World Transmissions". However, [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] ([[ZF Ecomat|4HP590]]) and [[Voith]] transmissions were also available on some models.

== History ==
In late 1983 through 1985, [[Neoplan USA|Neoplan]] delivered an order for over 1000 buses for the state of Pennsylvania. By 1989, the largest transportation network in Pennsylvania, SEPTA, had 1092 Neoplan AN440s in service. However over the years as they were heavily replaced mainly by [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer]] [[low-floor bus]]es, that were placed in service since between 2001 and 2006, While the remaining 35 Neoplan AN440s (EZ models) were sent to the SEPTA Frankford Depot, following after the retirement of the 1978 [[AM General]] Trolleybuses that retire in 2006, as they served as the temporary replacement, they were retired on June 20, 2008, following after the final delivery of the [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer]] [[trolleybus]]es was completed. SEPTA ordered 155 Neoplan AN460s from 1998-2000 to replace their aging [[Volvo B10M]] articulated buses and about 60 AN460 [[High-floor|high floor buses]] are in service until 2013, they were being replaced by [[Nova Bus LFS|Novabus LFS Artic]] [[articulated bus]]es, as of 2016, after delivering the last remaining set of Novabus Artics, all of the remaining AN460 buses were retired.

In the 1980s, [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|WMATA]], also known as Metro, and PAT [[Port Authority of Allegheny County|Port Authority Transit]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] complained about frame problems with their Neoplan coaches. However, today, they both run new Neoplan buses&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; WMATA with the AN460, a 60-foot articulated version, and PAT with AN460s and AN440LFs, the low floor version of these buses.

However, the AN440 and AN460 models ordered by the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] proved troublesome. Among the problems were insufficient, excessively noisy cooling fans (sounds reached up to 90&amp;nbsp;dB), faulty transmissions, maintenance intensive brake systems (needing service every 5,000 miles), and cracking frames. The problems were compounded when Neoplan eventually refused to fix the problems, instead choosing to repossess the remaining spare parts and abandon its overhaul yard located in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[Nuclear power plant]]s currently operate in 31 countries. 
Most are in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[East Asia]] and [[South Asia]].
The United States is the largest producer of nuclear power, while [[France]] has the largest share of electricity generated by nuclear power.
In 2010, before the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], it was reported that an average of about 10 nuclear reactors were expected to become operational per year, although according to the [[World Nuclear Association]], of the 17 civilian reactors planned to become operational between 2007 and 2009, only five actually came on stream.&lt;ref name="ditt"/&gt; 
Global nuclear electricity generation in 2012 was at its lowest level since 1999.&lt;ref name=wna13&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Nuclear_power_down_in_2012_2006131.html |title=Nuclear power down in 2012 |author=WNA |date=20 June 2013 |work=World Nuclear News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf104.html|title=The Nuclear Renaissance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, at least 100 older and smaller reactors will "most probably be closed over the next 10–15 years".&lt;ref name=ditt&gt;Michael Dittmar.

Some countries operated nuclear reactors in the past but have currently no operating nuclear plants. 
Among them, [[Nuclear power in Italy|Italy]] closed all of its nuclear stations by 1990 and nuclear power has since been discontinued because of the [[Italian referendums, 1987|1987 referendums]] on which Italians voted.
[[Lithuania]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Armenia]] are planning to reintroduce nuclear power in the future.

Several countries are currently operating nuclear power plants but are planning a [[nuclear power phase-out]].
These are [[Nuclear power in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Nuclear power in Germany|Germany]], [[Nuclear power in Spain|Spain]], and [[Nuclear power in Switzerland|Switzerland]]. 
Other countries, like [[Netherlands]], [[Nuclear power in Sweden|Sweden]], and [[Nuclear power in Taiwan|Taiwan]] are also considering a phase-out. 
[[Austria]] never started to use its first nuclear plant that was completely built. 

Due to financial, political and technical reasons, [[Cuba]], [[Nuclear power in Libya|Libya]], [[Nuclear power in North Korea|North Korea]], and [[Nuclear energy in Poland|Poland]] never completed the construction of their first nuclear plants, and [[Australia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Nuclear power in Ghana|Ghana]], [[Nuclear energy in Ireland|Ireland]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Peru]], [[Singapore]], and [[Nuclear energy in Venezuela|Venezuela]] never built their planned first nuclear plants.&lt;ref name=gl2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/47834 |title=Germany: Nuclear power to be phased out by 2022 |author=Duroyan Fertl |date=5 June 2011 |work=Green Left }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/business/global/26nuclear.html?_r=1 |title=Switzerland Decides on Nuclear Phase-Out |author=James Kanter |date=25 May 2011  |work=New York Times |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3331">A '''Penning mixture''',&lt;ref name="Weston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bylander" /&gt; named after [[Frans Michel Penning]], is a mixture of gases used in electric lighting or displaying fixtures. Although the popular phrase for the most common of these is a [[neon lamp]], it is more efficient to have the glass tube filled not with pure [[neon]], but with a Penning mixture, which is defined as a mixture of one [[inert gas]] with a minute amount of another gas, one that has lower [[ionization]] voltage than the main constituent (or constituents). 

== Explanation ==

The other gas, called a quench gas, has to have lower [[ionization potential]] than the first excited state of the noble gas. The energy of the excited, but neutral, noble gas atoms then can [[ionization|ionize]] the quench gas particles by energy transfer via collisions; known as the [[Penning ionization|Penning effect]].

A very common Penning mixture of about 98–99.5% of [[neon]] with 0.5–2% of [[argon]] is used in some neon lamps, especially those rated at 110 volts. The mixture is easier to ionize than either neon or argon alone, and lowers the striking voltage at which the tube becomes conductive and starts producing light. The optimal level of argon is about 0.25%, but some of it gets adsorbed onto the [[borosilicate glass]] used for the tubes, so higher concentrations are used to take the losses into account; higher argon content is used in higher-power tubes, as hotter glass adsorbs more argon. The argon changes the color of the "neon light", making it slightly more yellowish. The gas mixtures used in [[nixie tube]]s often also included a small amount of [[mercury (element)|mercury vapor]], which glowed blue.

A Penning mixture of neon and argon is also used as a starter gas in [[sodium vapor lamp]]s, where it is responsible for the faint reddish glow before the sodium emission begins.

The Penning mixture used in [[plasma display]]s is usually [[helium]] or [[neon]] with small percentage of [[xenon]], at several hundred [[torr]].

Penning mixtures with the formulas of argon-xenon, neon-argon, argon-[[acetylene]], and xenon-[[trimethylamine|TMA]] are used as filler gases in [[gaseous ionization detector]]s.

Other kinds of Penning mixture include [[helium]]-xenon.

As a result of the successful policies implemented to promote EV adoption, the stock of electric vehicles in Norway has increased rapidly, resulting in several unintended consequences, and raising several complaints and criticism. These include: high public subsidies as compared to the value of the reduced [[carbon footprint]] of electric vehicles; the possibility of traffic congestion in some of Oslo's bus lanes due to the increasing number of electric cars; the loss of revenue for some ferry operators due to the large number of electric cars exempted from payment; and the shortage of parking spaces for owners of conventional cars due to preference to electric cars (although this was actually the intended policy).&lt;ref name=Reuters032013/&gt;&lt;ref name=EVs2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=ferries/&gt;&lt;ref name=BusLanes/&gt;&lt;ref name=parking/&gt;

==Government goals and incentives==

===Existing incentives===

The adoption and deployment of [[electric vehicle]]s in Norway, particularly [[zero emission vehicle]]s, has been driven by policy, and since 1990, actively supported by the Norwegian government.&lt;ref name=Outlook2018&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webstore.iea.org/download/direct/1045?fileName=Global_EV_Outlook_2018.pdf |title=Global EV Outlook 2017: 3 million and counting |author=[[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), Clean Energy Ministerial, and Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI) |publisher=IEA Publications |date=May 2018 |accessdate=2018-11-10}} ''See pp. 9–10, 19–23, 29–28, and Statistical annex, pp. 107–113''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of Norway]] set the goal to reach 50,000 zero emission vehicles by 2018. Among the existing incentives, [[all-electric car]]s and utility vans are exempt in Norway from all non-recurring vehicle fees, including purchase taxes, which are extremely high for ordinary cars, and 25% [[VAT]] on purchase, together making electric car purchase price competitive with conventional cars.&lt;ref name=AVERE/&gt; As an example, by early 2013 the price of the top selling Nissan Leaf is 240,690 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]] (around {{USD|42,500}}) while the purchase price of the 1.3-lt [[Volkswagen Golf]] is 238,000 kroner (about {{USD|42,000}}).&lt;ref name=Reuters032013&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/13/us-cars-norway-idUSBRE92C0K020130313|title=Norway shows the way with electric cars, but at what cost? |author1=Alister Doyle  |author2=Nerijus Adomaitis |lastauthoramp=yes |work=[[Reuters]]|date=2013-03-13|accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric vehicles are also exempt from the annual [[road tax]], all public [[Free parking|parking fees]], and [[toll road|toll payments]], as well as being able to use [[bus lane]]s.&lt;ref name=AVERE/&gt;&lt;ref name=NorIncentives&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecgassociation.eu/Portals/0/Documentation/ECG%20News%202012/ECG%20News%2012.31.pdf|title=Electric Vehicle Policies in Norway|author=Lars Ole Valøen|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incentives are in effect until the end of 2017 or until the 50,000 EV target is achieved.&lt;ref name=AVERE/&gt;

Sales of plug-in hybrids have had a much smaller market penetration than pure electric car sales. Plug-in hybrids are not eligible for the same tax exemptions and other government incentives enacted for electric cars. Because the Norwegian tax system levies higher taxes to heavier vehicles, plug-in hybrids are more expensive than equivalent gasoline and diesel-powered cars due to the extra weight of the battery pack and its additional electric components.&lt;ref name=NorwaySales052013/&gt; Beginning on 1 July 2013, the existing weight deduction for [[hybrid electric vehicle|conventional hybrid]]s and plug-in hybrids of 10% was increased to 15% for PHEVs.&lt;ref name=IncentivesPHEV2013/&gt; The weight deduction was increased to 26% effective since January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2015/04/20/tema/motor/bil/38774168/ |title=Plugg inn - Nå kommer hybridene |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Plug-in: Now comes hybrids |author=Staff|work= [[Dagbladet]] |date=2015-04-26 |accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fiscal incentive combined with a broader range of models available in the market resulted in record sales of plug-in hybrids in 2015, with almost 8,000 new units registered, up from about 1,700 in 2014. The plug-in hybrid market share rose to 5.2%, up from just over 1% in 2014,&lt;ref name=Norway2015/&gt; and from 4.2% in September 2015 to 13.9% in September 2016.&lt;ref name=OFV2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=NorwaySept2016/&gt;

The government set identifying letters ("EL", "EK" and "EV") for use on license plates of electric vehicles to facilitate the enforcement of EV incentives and perks such a free parking, free passage through toll booths etc. Correspondingly, [[hydrogen vehicle]]s have "HY" as identifying letters. There is no equivalent for [[plug-in hybrid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.toi.no/getfile.php?mmfileid=33828 |title=Electromobility in Norway - experiences and opportunities with Electric vehicles |author=Erik Figenbaum Marika Kolbenstvedt |publisher=[[Institute of Transport Economics]] (TØI), Norwegian Centre for Transport Research |date=November 2013|accessdate=2016-03-05}} ''See section 3.2.1 Own identifying vehicle licence plate - EL, pp. 24.''&lt;/ref&gt;

As the number of registered electric cars and vans reached 60,000 units by July 2015, and because the "EL" prefix was set to end at "EL 99999" ([[Vehicle registration plates of Norway#Prefixes and sequence numbers|most vehicles in the country have five-digit registration numbers between 10000 and 99999]]), the Norwegian Public Roads agency opted for the prefix "EK" for the second series of plates, to signify "''elektrisk kjøretøy''", Norwegian for electric vehicle. The "EV" prefix was set aside for future electric cars.&lt;ref name=NorskEK&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2015/08/28/electric-car-craze-keeps-rolling-along/ |title=Electric car craze keeps rolling along |first=Nina |last=Berglund |work=News in English.no |date=2015-08-28 |accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, an ESA spokesman confirmed that the Government has not sent any request {{as of|2014|09|lc=y}}, nor has the agency received any complaints about Norway's original EV tax exemption. The MP said he would demand that the decision be implemented when Parliament meets in October 2014.&lt;ref name=LeasingVAT/&gt; The consultation was presented to ESA in November 2014, and the authority ruled in April 2015 that the implementation of the VAT exemption on leasing of electric vehicles and electric vehicle batteries is in line the EEA Agreement, since the goal is to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

The target of 50,000 electric cars on Norwegian roads was reached on 20 April 2015, more than two years earlier than expected. The milestone was commemorated by the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association in [[Drammen]] where the 50,000th electric car registered, a Tesla Model S, was granted the license plate "EL 60000." The special electric vehicle series began with "EL 10000."

==== Phase out of incentives ====

As one of the criteria to end the incentives was achieved, {{as of|2014|04|lc=y}}, no decision was made by the authorities about the reintroduction of the 25% VAT on purchase of electric vehicles. Among the options considered by the government were to introduce the tax in a step-wise fashion. However, Prime Minister [[Erna Solberg]] announced the government decided not to make any changes about the electric car benefits in the 2015 budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://e24.no/bil/ons-2014/hauge-slaar-alarm-om-elbilmoms/23280962|title=Hauge slår alarm om elbilmoms|language=Norwegian|trans-title=Hauge sounds the alarm over EV sales tax|first=Bjørn|last=Haugan|work=[[E24 Næringsliv]]|date=2014-08-25|accessdate=2014-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early March 2015, negotiations began among parties represented in the Parliament to define the future of all motor vehicles and fuel taxes. The Liberal Party wanted all the benefits to continue beyond the established quota. The Ministry of Finance also made a comprehensive review of all motor vehicle taxes. The two purchase tax exemptions cost the government about 3 billion kroner  (around {{USD|480 million}}) in lost revenue just in 2014, and up to 4 billion kroner  (around {{USD|640 million}}) if all the other benefits are accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv2.no/2015/02/26/nyheter/el-bil/6621425|title=Fredningstiden for elbilene snart over|language=Norwegian|trans-title=Close season for electric cars will be over soon|author1=Kristoffer Thoner  |author2=Robin Krüger |lastauthoramp=yes |work=[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV2]]|date=2015-02-26|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the Government decided to keep the existing incentives through 2017, and the political parties in Parliament agreed to reduced and phase out some of the incentives. Beginning in January 2018, electric car owners will be required to pay half of the yearly road license fee and the full rate as of 2020. The value-added tax (VAT) exemption for electric cars was scheduled to end in 2018, but replaced by a new scheme, which may be subjected to a ceiling that could be reduced as technology develops. The agreement also gave local authorities the right to decide whether electric cars can park for free and use public transport lanes.&lt;ref name=EV2018_1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/11589548/Norway-to-slash-electric-car-perks-because-its-costing-government-too-much-money.html | title=Norway to slash electric car perks because it's costing government too much money |work=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2015-05-07|accessdate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EV2018_2&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dn.no/nyheter/politikkSamfunn/2015/05/06/2226/Bilavgifter/samarbeidspartiene-enige-om-bilavgifter | title= Samarbeidspartiene enige om bilavgifter |language=Norwegian|trans-title=Cooperative parties agreed vehicle taxes |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=2015-05-06|accessdate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the Ministry of Transport issued new regulations for parking in locations with access to the general public. The new parking regulations, that went into effect on January 1, 2017, terminated the free parking for zero-emission vehicles, but established that Municipalities are allowed to introduce payment exemption for electric and hydrogen powered motor vehicles on municipal parking locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2016-03-18-260#KAPITTEL_1 | title=Forskrift om vilkårsparkering for allmennheten og håndheving av private parkeringsreguleringer (parkeringsforskriften) | language=Norwegian |trans-title=Regulations on conditions parking for the general public and the enforcement of private parking regulations (parking regulations) | author=Ministry of Transport | publisher=LOVEDATA | accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|09}}, the city councils of [[Trondheim]] and [[Tønsberg]] decided to introduce full payment for EVs from 2017; the cities of [[Bodø]] and [[Tromsø]] introduced payment for parking in downtown but exempted parking outside the city's center; and the cities of [[Oslo]], [[Mandal, Norway|Mandal]] and [[Drammen]] decided to keep free parking for zero-emission vehicles.&lt;ref name=Norsk092016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://elbil.no/drammen-fortsetter-med-gratis-elbilparkering/ | title=Drammen fortsetter med gratis elbilparkering |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Drammen continues with free parking for electric cars | first=Ståle |last=Frydenlundd |publisher=Norsk Elbilforening (Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association) |date=2016-09-21 |accessdate=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tv2.no/nyheter/8620804/ | title=I denne byen blir det slutt på gratis elbil-parkering |language=Norwegian |trans-title=This city finally gets free electric vehicle parking | first=Robin

For the 2017 National Budget, the Government proposed to extend the [[VAT]] exemption for zero-emission vehicles until 2020. It also put forward a national rule to keep a maximum tax rate of zero-emission vehicles equal to half the value charged to conventional cars. The budget proposal also included an adjustment to exempt plug-in hybrids from the higher taxes levied to heavier vehicles, and instead, to charge taxes based on their fuel economy under the [[New European Driving Cycle]] (NEDC). Until 2016, all plug-in hybrids had a weight allowance of 26% regardless of their [[all-electric range]] or fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name=NorskBudget2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=NorskBudget2017_2/&gt;

In October 2017, the National Government proposed in its 2018 Budget a new tax for EVs based on weight. This proposal would affect mainly bigger electric car models, all [[Tesla Inc.|Tesla]] vehicles, and in particular the [[Tesla Model X]]. After some public controversy, the proposal was dropped. Nevertheless, Tesla's sales surge at the end of 2017 for consumers' fear of the introduction of the new tax.&lt;ref name=CO2Norsk_1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2017/10/13/tesla-tax-norway/ |title=Understanding Norway’s new proposed ‘Tesla tax’ on electric cars |first=Fred |last=Lambert |publisher=Electrek.co |date=2017-10-13 |accessdate=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elbil.no/statsbudsjettet-2018-gambler-med-elbilmarkedet/ ||title=Statsbudsjettet 2018: – Gambler med elbilmarkedet |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Government Budget 2018: Gambling with the electric car market| author=Staff |work=Norsk Elbilforening (Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association) |date=2017-10-11 |accessdate=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals for 2018-2029===

In February 2016, the government opened for public discussion until 1 July 2016 the proposed National Transport Plan 2018-2029 (NTP). The plan explains that the transportation sector accounts for emissions of about 16.5 million [[ton]]s of {{CO2}}, which is about one third of the total [[greenhouse gas emissions]] produced domestically in Norway. And road traffic, including both private cars and heavy vehicles, account for about 10 million tons of {{Co2}}. The NTP set policies and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from private cars, trucks, ships, aircraft and construction equipment by about one half until 2030.&lt;ref name=NTP01/&gt;&lt;ref name=NTP02/&gt;

In order to achieve this objective, among others, the NTP sets the goal for all sales of new cars, urban buses and light commercial vehicles in 2025 to be [[zero emission vehicles]], this is, all-electric and [[hydrogen vehicle]]s. By 2030, heavy-duty vans, 75% of new long-distance buses, and 50% of new trucks must be zero emission vehicles.&lt;ref name=Outlook2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=NTP01/&gt;&lt;ref name=NTP02/&gt;&lt;ref name=NTP03/&gt; Also, by 2030, 40% of all ships in short sea shipping should be using biofuels or be low- or zero-emission ships. The proposed strategy states that until zero-emission vehicles take over, all internal combustion engine cars sold be plug-in hybrids, and wherever possible, biofuels must be used. Also, government agencies should as far as possible make use of biofuels, low- and zero-emission technologies in private and hired vehicles and vessels. The plan also calls to support the deployment of zero emission vehicles, but also for the reduction of the existing incentives, and proposes to invest more in public transport, walking and cycling.&lt;ref name=NTP01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.side3.no/motor/ntp-na-kommer-elbil-bakrusen/3423197581.html |title=NTP: Nå kommer elbil-bakrusen |language=Norwegian |trans-title=NTP: Now Comes EV Hangover |first = Magnus |last=Blaker |publisher=Side3.no |date=2016-02-29 |accessdate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NTP02&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kystverket.no/Nyheter/2016/februar/ntp-klimautslippene-ma-kuttes/ |title=NTP: Klimautslippene må kuttes |language=Norwegian |trans-title=NTP: Greenhouse gas emissions must be cut  |publisher=[[Norwegian Coastal Administration]] |date=2016-02-29|accessdate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NTP03&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/norway-aiming-for-100-percent-zero-emission-vehicle-sales-by-2025/ | title=Norway Aiming For 100-Percent Zero Emission Vehicle Sales By 2025 |first=Jeff |last=Cobb|work=HybridCars.com |date=2016-03-08 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the incentives===
[[File:Oslo taxi Tesla.jpg|thumb|[[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]] providing [[taxi cab]] service in Oslo]]

Since 2013 several complaints and criticism have arisen due to the rapid increase in the number of electric vehicles on the roads as a result of the existing incentives to promote EV adoption, and particularly about the non-fiscal incentives. These include high public subsidies as compared to the value of the reduced [[carbon footprint]] of electric vehicles; the [[Modal share|travel mode]] shift by people who buy an electric vehicle as a second car instead of taking buses and trains; the potential traffic congestion in Oslo's bus lanes due to the increasing number of electric cars; the loss of revenue for some ferry operators due to the large number of electric cars exempted from payment; and shortage of parking spaces for owners of conventional cars due to preference to electric cars and lack of a cap on parking time.

====Excessive subsidies====

According to the results of a study published by [[Reuters]] in March 2013, prepared by Bjart Holtsmark, an analyst of [[Statistics Norway]], the tax exemptions on the purchase of an electric car are worth almost {{USD|11,000}} in comparison to the fully taxed price of a regular [[internal combustion engine]] car, which is equivalent to {{USD|1,400}} a year over a car's lifetime (8 years). The value of the toll exemption for driving into Oslo are worth {{USD|1,400}} per year, the free parking is worth {{USD|5,000}} per year, and electric cars avoid other charges worth {{USD|400}} a year. Without adding value to the benefit of driving in bus lanes, the annual benefit of owning an electric car in Oslo is estimated at {{USD|8,200}} per car, per year. The analysis used a [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]] as the benchmark vehicle. Mr. Holtsmark also pointed out that "by encouraging people who can afford it to buy a second car instead of taking buses and trains, the electric car scheme may ironically be aggravating environmental problems and causing traffic jams."&lt;ref name=Reuters032013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rebuttal/&gt;

The Norwegian project ''Grønn bil'' (Green Car) disputed these figures because they consider the analysis is based on unrealistic assumptions. The group argues that the analysis used a very short total vehicle lifespan of 7.8 years, while Norway's' average is closer to 18 years; it is very unlikely that a vehicle can be parked in Oslo between 1,875 hours and 3,000 hours per year to save the estimated {{USD|5.000}} considering the existing time limits for parking; and the typical EV owner drives around {{Convert|15,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} per year, not the {{Convert|6,500|km|mi|abbr=on}} implicit in the analysis. Using what they consider more realistic assumptions, ''Grønn bil'' estimates that the annual benefit of owning an electric car in Oslo is estimated at {{USD|3,336}} per car, per year, 40% of Holtsmark's estimation. They also found that the cost per tonne of {{co2}} emissions reduced is {{USD|2,499}}, not the {{USD|13,600}} estimated by Holtsmark.&lt;ref name=Rebuttal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gronnbil.no/nyheter/highly-misleading-figures-regarding-norwegian-ev-benefits-in-reuters-article-article326-239.html|title=Highly misleading figures regarding Norwegian EV benefits in Reuters article|author=Ole Henrik Hannisdahl|publisher=Grønn bil|date=2012-03-22|accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bus lane congestion====

In December 2013 the newspaper ''[[Budstikka]]'' conducted an informal test to measure the difference in travel time between an electric car and a gasoline-powered car during the morning rush hour on a stretch of road between the suburban municipality of [[Asker]] in [[Akershus]], and [[Skøyen]], a neighborhood of Oslo. The electric car completed the trip in 19 minutes using the [[bus lane]] while it took 51 minutes for the conventional car traveling in the normal lanes. Around noon, the same trip took the electric car just 13 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.budstikka.no/%C3%B8konomi-bolig/sa-rask-er-el-bilen-kontra-bensinbilen-1.8202727|title=Så rask er el-bilen kontra bensinbilen|language=Norwegian|trans-title=So fast is the electric car vs. the gasoline car|first=Kaja|last=Mejlbo|work=[[Budstikka]]|date=2013-12-09|accessdate=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nissan Leaf in bus lanes Norway.jpg|thumb|left|All-electric cars have access to [[bus lane]]s in Norway. Shown a Nissan Leaf, the top selling plug-in electric car for three years running (2012-2014).]]

''Budstikka'' also did a count of the number of vehicles traveling in the bus lane during the rush hour on December 3, 2013. The newspaper found that a total of 829 vehicles used the bus lane between 7:30 and 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., of which, 618 vehicles were electric cars (74.5%). Buses accounted for only 7.5% of the traffic in the bus lane, and taxis, two-wheelers and mini-buses made up the rest. The Deputy Director of the [[Institute of Transport Economics]] (TØI) explained that the normal capacity of a highway lane is between 1,800 and 2,000 vehicles per hour, but because of the ramp entrances and exits, and the buses maneuvering in and out the bus lane to do their stops, the traffic flow starts to become troublesome when the number of vehicles in the bus lane is about 1,000 vehicles per hour. Although by December 2013 the traffic is approaching this limit, TØI's Deputy Director did not want to predict when this critical situation will occur. The Manager of the green car advocate group Grønn Bil warned that "if the only reason people bought an electric car is to drive in the bus lane, they will probably be disappointed sooner or later."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/elbilene-kan-gi-full-stopp-i-kollektivfeltet-neste-ar-1.8203938|title=Elbilene kan gi full stopp i kollektivfeltet neste år|language=Norwegian|trans-title=Electric cars can cause full stop in the bus lanes next year|author1=Nils H.

By mid-2014, bus drivers in some parts of [[Oslo]] begun complaining about the delays caused by the ever-increasing number of electric cars. An interviewed bus driver expressed his concern that the electric cars "can create a vicious circle - tired of being stuck in traffic, bus users could be tempted to buy an electric car themselves, worsening the congestion problem."&lt;ref name=EVs2015&gt;{{cite news|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/booming-electric-car-sales-under-042519998.html#msKmkdy|title=Booming electric car sales under fire in Norway|author=Pierre-Henry Deshayes|work=[[Agence France-Presse]]|publisher=[[Yahoo|Yahoo News UK]]|date=2014-08-31|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration]], {{as of|2014|08|lc=y}}, electric cars represent 85% of traffic in the bus lanes during rush hours. As of late August 2014, Norwegian ministers are under increasing pressure to reduce the non-financial incentives and tax breaks for electric cars in order to reduce a rising congestion problem, but no decision has been made by the central government authorities. The success of electric car adoption was unexpected, as the authorities planned to keep the incentives in place until the end of 2017, or until they reach 50,000 units.&lt;ref name=EVs2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2014/09/02/norway-under-pressure-to-cut-ev-incentives/|title=Norway under pressure to cut EV incentives|first=Faye|last=Sunderland|work=The Green Car Website UK|date=2014-09-02|accessdate=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the pace of sales reached during 2014, the target of 50,000 EVs registered could be met by April or May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dinside.no/932429/elbilfordelene-kan-ikke-vare-evig|title=Elbilfordelene kan ikke vare evig|language=Norwegian|trans-title=EV benefits can not last forever|first=Knut|last=Moberg|work=Dinside.com|date=2015-01-16|accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to local authorities from the city of Oslo, the negative effects on the bus lanes occur only at certain places and in certain times of the day, particularly at the [[Norwegian National Road E18]], west of Oslo. The problems are concentrated at the exit and entry ramps that in the long term might have serious consequences for bus accessibility. All the involved agencies are monitoring the situation and Oslo's authorities consider that restrictions for EVs to access the bus lanes should be considered only when it becomes a major problem for the buses.&lt;ref name=BusLanes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/forbruker/bil-baat-og-motor/elbil/34-000-elbiler-ut-paa-veien-det-neste-aaret/a/23294635/|title=Forventer eksplosjon i elbilsalget: 34.000 elbiler ut på veien det neste året|language=Norwegian|trans-title=Expecting explosion in electric car sales: 34,000 new EVs on the road next year|author1=Hanne Hattrem  |author2=Øystein Larsen-Vonstett |lastauthoramp=yes |work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=2014-09-14|accessdate=2014-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Burden on ferry operators====

[[File:Tau ferger (6934452319).jpg|thumb|Electric cars are exempted from payment of [[ferryboat]] fees.]]
As part of the incentives to promote EV adoption, plug-in electric vehicles are exempted from payment of [[ferryboat]] fees, but only the car crosses for free, the driver and each passenger pay the ordinary fare. The accelerated growth of electric cars on some ferry routes has caused complaints from [[ferryboat]] operators due to the increasing loss on their [[farebox]] revenues. According to FosenNamsos Sea AS, an operator with four ferry lines servicing [[Hordaland]] county, during the first seven months of 2014 the number of electric vehicles riding the service [[Krokeidet]]-[[Hufthamar]] from Hordaland increased by 215% compared to the same period last year, for a total of 9,226 electric cars not paying the ferry fee though the end of July. The company argues that "''no one could foresee the tremendous growth of electric cars we see on some ferry routes, but the [[Austevoll]] satellite connection involves a significant loss of revenue for us.''"&lt;ref name=ferries/&gt;

On 1 June 2014, the company's home county of [[Sør-Trøndelag]] repealed the payment exemption for electric vehicles on the county ferries. The company has also requested to Transport of Hordaland a similar end of the exemption or some form of the income loss compensation. FosenNamsos Sea AS has argued that the financial burden should be on the government not the ferry operators. {{As of|2014|09|01}}, the county of Hordaland had 5,016 registered electric cars, the second largest in Norway after Oslo. Hordaland transport authorities are studying the request but already have stated that the agency must follow state regulations for ferry rates and the regulations established for electric cars.&lt;ref name=ferries&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/Taper-stort-pa-elbilokningen-3195758.html|title=Losses due to large increase in electric car|language=Norwegian|trans-title=Taper large increase in electric car|author=Håkon Glatved-Prahl|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|date=2014-09-11|accessdate=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unfairness of free parking====

[[File:EV parking lot Oslo 10 2018 3793.jpg|thumb|Free parking lot exclusive for all-electric cars in Oslo, Norway.]]
As an incentive to promote EV adoption, plug-in electric vehicles are exempted from public [[parking fee]]s. Politicians in [[Trondheim]], in [[Sør-Trøndelag]] county are complaining about the lack of parking spaces for owners of conventional cars due to preference to electric cars. The city has a five-hour time limit for electric cars to use street parking for free, but electric car owners who use their car to commute keep moving their cars during the day, and end up having free parking all day while they are at work. A City Council member noted that in many streets there are large numbers of plug-in electric vehicles parked all day, and sometimes there are more electric cars than regular cars. This situation makes it difficult to find parking for those who come to the city to shop. In addition, the municipality of Trondheim is losing revenue. The City Counselor wants to end the incentives electric car owners have to park downtown Trondheim all day long for free.&lt;ref name=parking&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/trondelag/trondheim-fylles-opp-av-elbiler-1.11691491|title=Vil begrense parkeringstiden for elbiler|language=Norwegian|trans-title=Parking time for electric cars to be limited|author1=Sissel M Thorsen  |author2=Morten Karlsen |lastauthoramp=yes |work=[[NRK]]|date=2014-09-01|accessdate=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charging infrastructure===

{{As of|2016|03}}, there are in the country 7,632 [[electric recharge point]]s. The county with the most stations is Oslo with 1,996 points, followed by Akershus with 1,117, and Hordaland with 932. The Norwegian charging infrastructure includes 293 [[CHAdeMO]] quick charging points and 194 fast charging points at [[Tesla supercharger]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gronnbil.no/ladepunkter|title=Ladepunkter i Norge|trans-title=EV Charging Points in Norway|publisher=Grønn bil|date=March 2016|accessdate=2016-03-09|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage patterns and attitudes==

===2013 survey===
In June 2013, the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association (''Norsk Elbilforening'') conducted a survey among all-electric car owners, with a total of 1,858 respondents, representing over 15% of all the electric car owners in Norway. The study found that the typical electric car owner is a middle-aged family father with higher education and income, and he owns a Nissan Leaf as one of two cars. A total of 85% of the respondents had two or more cars in their household because they need a second car for longer journeys given the limited range current electric cars can provide. However, for everyday needs, the study found that one electric car is sufficient. Norwegians travel 42&amp;nbsp;km on average every day, mostly by car. Based on the survey, the study found that 15% of the electric car owners do their daily travel with just their one electric car. These users opt for public transport or car rental/[[car sharing|sharing]] for longer trips, because high taxation on traditional cars in Norway makes it expensive to own a car.&lt;ref name=Survey2013&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tekes.fi/contentassets/c2e729551a964321958a0c6c6c33b45f/norwegian_electric_car_user_experiences_-_evs27_paper.pdf | title=Norwegian electric car user experiences | first1=Petter | last1=Haugneland | first2=Hans | last2=Håvard Kvisle | publisher=EVS27 Barcelona | date=November 2013 | accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study also found that about half of the respondents to the 2013 survey own a Nissan Leaf the best-selling electric car in Norway and among the top five at the general model ranking. About 5% of the respondents had more than one electric car, as some owners kept their old electric car (such as Th!nk and Buddy) when they bought a new one. The survey showed that in most cases electric cars replaced a traditional car (87%), but also use of public transport (10%), and walking and bicycling (1%). Regarding everyday use of electric cars, the study found that owners use the electric car mostly for commuting to work (89.6%), shopping (88.4%) and driving to after work activities (77.0%). Other uses include delivery of children to school or kindergarten (40.9%) and for business purposes (40.2%). On the other hand, use of the electric car for holiday travel is very limited (11.7%).&lt;ref name=Survey2013/&gt;

As for the charging patterns, the 2013 survey found that 85% of the respondents could charge in their own garage or parking lot, and 10% had access to charging in the shared apartment building where they live. This means that 95% of the respondents were able to charge their electric cars at home during the night. The survey showed that 59% of the respondents had access to charging where they work, and 48% at public charging stations in the area they normally use the electric car.&lt;ref name=Survey2013/&gt;

===2016 survey===
The Norwegian [[Institute of Transport Economics]] conducted in March 2016 a survey among over 8,000 vehicle owners in Norway. The study's aim was to identified how the plug-in vehicles are used, why they are bought and how the technology is rated compared to owners of [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) vehicles. The sample consisted of 3,111 all-electric vehicles (BEV) owners, 2,065 private plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners, and 3,080 ICE vehicle owners.&lt;ref name=TOI2016/&gt; The study found that buyers of BEVs and PHEVs have different transport needs but both are motivated by economy of use and environment, whereas all-electric vehicle owners are also motivated by the free toll road incentive. The survey showed that normally diesel and gasoline vehicles are replaced with the purchase of a plug-in vehicle, but a larger share of battery electric vehicles become extra vehicles in households. BEV owners are younger, have more children, travel a longer distance to work and own more vehicles than other vehicle owners.&lt;ref name=TOI2016/&gt;

[[File:Elbilfestival i Geiranger.jpg|thumb|275px|Electric vehicle festival in [[Geiranger]]]]
Most BEV owners (71%) also own an ICEV, 4% a PHEV, and 4% more than one BEV. The remaining 21% only have one BEV. 46% of PHEV owners and 48% of ICEV owners belong to single vehicle household. The most multipurpose BEV, [[Tesla Model S]], is twice as common in single BEV households as in households also owning ICEVs, and four times as common in households owning several BEVs.&lt;ref name=TOI2016/&gt; Based on the survey, the researchers found that plug-in hybrid owners in Norway drive on average 55% of their annual distance in charge-depleting or all-electric mode ([[EV mode]]), and the share goes up to about 63% for work trips. The share of electric travel is higher for trips to work and in the summer, and lower in the winter. The average plug-in hybrid user in the survey drives 60% of the total distance in EV mode in the summer and 53% in winter. The estimate for work trips is higher at 70% in the summer and 59% in winter. On the other hand, the study found that battery electric vehicles are driven more in total and in everyday traffic.&lt;ref name=TOI2016&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.toi.no/getfile.php?mmfileid=43161 | title=Learning from Norwegian Battery Electric and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle users |first1=Erik |last1=Figenbaum |first2=Marika |last2=Kolbenstvedt |publisher=[[Institute of Transport Economics]] (TØI), Norwegian Centre for Transport Research |date=June 2016 |accessdate=2016-08-17}} ''TØI report 1492/2016. See: "Hydropower use" - pp.1, "Estimated percentage in EV mode" - pp. 55.''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the survey results, plug-in vehicles are mainly charged at home, whether in their garage or at an outdoor parking on the owner property, with 59% of BEV owners and 74% of PHEV owners charging this way. Only 6% of BEV owners and 5% of PHEV owners never charge at home. Charging at work is relatively common among BEV owners, 28% do it more than twice a week, 38% weekly. About 21% of PHEV owners do it at least weekly. Charging elsewhere is rare, but BEVs owners more frequently recharged at public charging stations and shopping centers than
PHEV owners. Fast charging is used for irregular trips where users plan to use fast chargers to accomplish the trip or to solve a problem on the go. Most battery electric vehicle owners manage everyday life well and are satisfied with the vehicle which in combination with attractive local incentives not available to plug-in hybrid owners and other vehicle users.&lt;ref name=TOI2016/&gt;

Peer-to-peer influences is particularly important to diffusion of battery electric vehicles being the biggest source of information leading to the purchase. Plug-in hybrid buyers received most information leading to the purchase from dealers and advertising material. The four reasons most frequently mentioned by the 89% of BEV owners who say they will buy a BEV again are economy of use, environmental performance, future proof technology, and the free usage of toll roads without paying. Less than 1% will not buy a BEV again. The reasons not to buy again are range and charging issues. The three main reasons why 80% of PHEV owners say they will buy one again are economy of use, environmental performance and that the technology is future proof. Only 2% will not buy a PHEV again. The main reasons not to buy again are the short range in all-electric mode and inability to use EV mode when it is cold.&lt;ref name=TOI2016/&gt;

===2018 survey===

The Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association (''Norsk Elbilforening'') conducted a survey among all-electric car owners in June 2018, with a total of 9,520 respondents. The study found that 63% of Norwegian households with electric cars also have a fossil car or hybrid car, down from 70% in 2017. The survey also found that among respondents having only one car in the household, one third (32.4%) are electric car owners, up from 26.3% in 2017.&lt;ref name=Survey2018elbil&gt;{{cite web| url=https://elbil.no/stadig-flere-husholdninger-har-bare-elbil/ | title=Stadig flere husholdninger har bare elbil | language=Norwegian |trans-title=More and more households only have a electric car |author=Martin Thronsen |work=Norsk Elbilforening (Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association) | date=2018-06-25 | accessdate=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of spectacular growth, the market share of all-electric cars suffered a decline over the previous year, while the plug-in hybrid segment experienced significant growth.&lt;ref name=NorwaySept2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norsk092016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norsk062016/&gt; In terms of sales volume during the first half of 2016, for the first time plug-in hybrid registrations (10,338) were very close to all-electrics (11,744).&lt;ref name=Norsk062016/&gt; Accounting for registrations during the first three quarters of 2016, plug-in hybrids grew nearly three-fold from the same period in 2016.&lt;ref name=NorwaySept2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norsk092016&gt;{{cite web| url=http://elbil.no/15-av-100-nye-biler-er-fortsatt-elbiler/ | title=15 av 100 nye biler er fortsatt elbiler |language=Norwegian |trans-title=15 of 100 new cars are still electric cars |author=Norsk Elbilforening (Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association) |publisher=Norsk Elbilforening | date=2016-10-13 | accessdate=2016-10-15}} ''See graph "Antall elbiler of ladbare hybrider i Norge" for number of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids in Norway by year.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OFV092016/&gt;

According to the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association this new trend is the result of uncertainty created by the government about the future incentives for zero-emission vehicles.&lt;ref name=Norsk062016/&gt; Also, buyers have more models to choose from, as the number of plug-in hybrid cars available in the market has increased significantly, {{as of|2016|08|lc=y}}, there were 19 plug-in hybrid models in the market and 15 all-electric cars.&lt;ref name=BEVorPHEV/&gt; Accounting for cumulative registrations between January and July 2016, four plug-in hybrids were listed among the top 10 selling plug-in electric cars, with a plug-in hybrid ranking for the first time ever in first place. As the trend of stronger plug-in hybrid sales continued in July 2016, the split between battery electric cars and plug-in hybrids almost reached parity, with 12,855 electric cars (51.3%) registered in the first seven months of 2016 compared to 12,203 plug-in hybrids registered in the same period (48.7%).&lt;ref name=BEVorPHEV/&gt; In September 2016, the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association proposed to the government to change the rules in the 2017 budget to limit the incentives for plug-in hybrids with insufficient [[all-electric range]] and luxury models featuring an electric powertrain with a small battery with the sole purpose of increasing power output.&lt;ref name=NorwaySept2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=NorskBudget2017&gt;{{cite web | url=http://elbil.no/et-darlig-elbilbudsjett/ | title= Et dårlig elbilbudsjett | language=Norwegian |trans-title=A poor electric car budget |first=Petter |last=Haugneland | publisher=Norsk Elbilforening (Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association) | date=2016-10-06 |accessdate=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NorskBudget2017_2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://elbil.no/gode-og-darlige-ladbare-hybrider-phev/ | title= Må skille mellom gode og dårlige ladbare hybrider | language=Norwegian |trans-title=Must distinguish between good and bad rechargeable hybrids |author=Staff | work=Norsk Elbilforening (Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association) | date=2016-10-05 |accessdate=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, [[European Federation for Transport and Environment]], based on research by the EU Electromobility Platform, reported that there is evidence from Norway and other European countries suggesting that EV adoption is being hampered locally by insufficient supply of electric cars to match the existing level of demand. In the particular case of Norway, despite being a small country, demand is outstripping supply, and as a result, the waiting time for costumers wanting to buy a electric car is between 8 months and 2 years, while thousands have paid deposits to be on a waiting list for new models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.transportenvironment.org/news/evidence-norway-poor-supply-cars-holding-back-e-vehicle-revolution | title=Evidence in Norway of poor supply of cars holding back e-vehicle revolution |publisher=[[European Federation for Transport and Environment|Transport &amp; Environment]] | date=2018-05-02 | accessdate=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association (''Norsk Elbilforening'') reported that there is a supply shortage of some electric cars models already released, and also, there are many customers who already paid a deposit for reservation of a future model, for a combined total of about 30,000 electric car customers listed on different waiting lists.&lt;ref name=30Kwaitlist&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.dinside.no/motor/i-kulissene-kampen-om-elbilene/70436196 |author=Fred Magne Skillebæk| title=I kulissene: Kampen om elbilene |trans-title=Behind the scenes: The battle for the electric cars |work=Dinside.no | date=2018-11-08 | accessdate=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NRK30k/&gt;

{{Asof|2018|10}}, the waiting list for models already released include the [[Tesla Model 3]] (10,000), [[Hyundai Kona Electric]] (6,000), [[Nissan Leaf#Second generation (2017–present)|second generation Nissan Leaf]] (3,000), and [[Jaguar I-Pace]] (3,000). The waiting list for models slated for release in the Norwegian market in the near future include: the  [[Audi e-tron quattro]] (6,300),  [[Kia e-Niro]] (5,900), [[Porsche Taycan]] (2,300), [[Mercedes-Benz EQC]] (2,200), [[DS 3 Crossback|DS Crossback E-Tense]] (1,350), and [[BMW iX3]] (1,000).&lt;ref name=NRK30k&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nrk.no/rogaland/nordmenn-har-betalt-over-400-millioner-for-a-vente-pa-elbil-1.14240822 |title=Nordmenn har betalt over 400 millioner for å vente på elbil | language=Norwegian | trans-title=Norwegians have paid over 400 million krone to wait for electric cars | author=Mari Rollag Evensen | work=[[NRK]] | date=2018-10-10| accessdate=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total paid reservations amount to more than 40,000 pre-orders, as some costumers signed in for more than one model. According to [[NRK]] estimates, the total amount paid by costumers in these waiting lists is about 400 million krone (about {{USD|48 million}}). By monetary value, the waiting list is led by the Audi e-tron quattro and the Tesla Model 3.&lt;ref name=NRK30k/&gt;

===Registrations by model===

The following table presents registrations of plug-in electric cars and utility vans by model per year since 2008 through December 2015. Figures between 2008 and 2013 correspond to the combined number of first registrations by year accounting for both, new and used imports. Figures for 2014 and 2015 correspond only to new car registrations. The breakdown between new and used import for the Nissan Leaf and the Kia Soul EV is shown because these are the two PEV models with the largest share of used import registrations (almost 70%).&lt;!--The source providing registration figures for both used and new registrations stopped publishing them in September 2014. As a result, full year figures for 2014 and 2015 report only new car registrations.--&gt;
&lt;!--I intend to update this table once a year. Feel free to update at any other time. Mariordo.--&gt;

== Effects on oil consumption == 

[[File:Annual sales of petroleum products in Norway.png|thumb|275px|Historical trend of annual sales of petroleum products for road motor vehicles in Norway, 2013-2017. Source: Statistisk sentralbyrå (Statistics Norway).]]

Despite having for many years the world's highest growth rates and highest penetration of EVs, Norway’s crude oil consumption for motor vehicles increased from 2013 to 2016, particularly dutiable diesel fuel. One factor in the slow decline of oil consumption is Norway’s relatively rapid population growth. Another factor is the significant number of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles still on the roads, with only 5% being plug-in electric passenger cars by the end of 2016.&lt;ref name=TopTen2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=OilForbes/&gt;

However, according to [[Forbes]], government figures for the sales of petroleum products in 2017, show that for the first time since 2014 Norway's consumption of gasoline and diesel declined across the board in 2017. Motor gasoline sales declined by 2.9%, dutiable diesel fell by 2.7%, and duty-free diesel (used by agricultural equipment) declined by 2.6%. This decline follows oil sales that were flat in 2014, and then grew by 1% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2016.&lt;ref name=OilForbes&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2018/05/24/electric-vehicles-could-finally-be-reducing-norways-fuel-consumption/#231f27c23ff6 |title=Electric Vehicles Could Finally Be Reducing Norway's Fuel Consumption | first=Robert | last= Rapier | work=[[Forbes]] | date=2017-05-24 | accessdate=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on average fleet CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions ==

[[File:Average fleet CO2 emissions Norway.png|thumb|275px|Historical trend of annual average new fleet {{CO2}} emissions in Norway (2011-2018).&lt;br&gt;Source: Norwegian Road Federation (OFV)]]

A 2009 [[Directive (European Union)|European Union regulation]] set a mandatory [[European emission standards#Obligatory vehicle CO2 emission limits|average {{CO2}} emissions target for new cars]] of 130 g/km, that were phased in between 2012 and 2015. A target of 95 g/km will apply from 2021. This regulation applies to the average fleet emissions of new passenger cars sold in the [[European Union]] and [[European Economic Area|EEA]] member states. A car manufacturer who fails to comply has to pay an "excess emissions premium" for each car registered according with amount of g/km of exceedance. The average emissions level of a new car sold in 2017 was significantly below the 2015 target, at 118.5 grams of {{CO2}} per km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles/cars_en |title=Reducing CO2 emissions from passenger cars |work=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway achieved in 2016 the European target set for 2021, with average {{CO2}} emissions for all new passenger cars registered in 2016 of 93 g/km, down 7 g/km from 2015.&lt;ref name=OFVCO2_122017&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofvas.no/co2-utslippet-i-desember/category708.html |title=CO2-utslippet i desember |language=Norwegian|trans-title=CO2 emissions in Dicember |author=Norwegian Road Federation (OFV)|publisher=OFV |date=January 2017 |accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to reduce the country's [[greenhouse gas emissions]], the Norwegian government pledged in 2012, among other measures, a target for the average fleet {{CO2}} emission rate of new passenger cars of 85 g/km by 2020, 10 g/km lower than the [[European Commission]]'s targets for 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regeringen.se/4a4b1c/contentassets/7bb237f0adf546daa36aaf044922f473/underlagsrapport-2---norge.pdf |title=Greenhouse Gas Abatement in the Norwegian Transport Sector |author=Lasse Fridstrøm |publisher=[[Institute of Transport Economics]] (TØI), Norwegian Centre for Transport Research |date=December 2012 |accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CO2Norsk_1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nettavisen.no/na24/tesla-salget-eksploderte-i-2017---halvparten-av-nye-biler-har-na-elmotor/3423402619.html |title=Tesla-salget eksploderte i 2017 - halvparten av nye biler har nå elmotor |language=Norwegian|trans-title=Tesla sales exploded in 2017 - half of new cars now have electric motor |first=Magnus |last=Blaker|work=[[NA24]]|date=2018-01-03 |accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of its fast growing EV [[market penetration]], average fleet {{CO2}} emissions have been falling in Norway from month to month. Average {{CO2}} emissions for all new passenger cars registered in 2017 was 82 g/km, down from 93 g/km in 2016, and below the government's target of 85 grams set for 2020. With all-electric cars accounting for just over 5% of the total stock of passenger cars registered at the end of 2017, Norway achieved its transportation emissions target three years before the pledged deadline.&lt;ref name=5pctEVs2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=CO2Norsk_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CO2Norsk_2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climateaction.org/news/norway-achieves-its-transport-emissions-target-three-years-early |title=Norway achieves its transport emissions target three years early | publisher=Climate Action| date=2018-01-04 | accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, the average {{CO2}} emissions from all first-time registered new passenger cars achieved a new record low of 55 g/km, down from 71 g/km in September 2017.&lt;ref name=OFV092018/&gt; An explanation of the new records, among other things, is found in the record sales of all-electric cars that took place in September 2018, when for the first time ever, zero emissions cars stood for almost half of passenger car sales for a month (45.3%). Such a large number of electric cars caused a record low average fleet {{CO2}} emissions.&lt;ref name=OFV092018/&gt;&lt;ref name=OFVCO2_92018&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofvas.no/co2-utslippet-i-september/category783.html |title=CO2-utslippet i september |language=Norwegian|trans-title=CO2 emissions in September |author=Norwegian Road Federation (OFV)|publisher=OFV |date=October 2018 |accessdate=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Piggyback on French subsidies===

Some car dealers in Norway have been importing new and used plug-in electric cars, in particular from Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. In the case of the Nissan Leaf, these dealers buy mostly new cars at a lower price than Norway's retail price thanks to the moderate demand for Leaf in other countries, where better price deals are offered. Then, the cars are sold in the Norwegian market up to 30,000 [[Norwegian krone|kr]] (~ {{USD|5,000}}) cheaper than from Norway's dealerships. Official Norwegian dealers have raised questions about the kind of guarantee offered for the imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bladet.no/bilogtrafikk/article6871899.ece |title=Elbil-boom i Norge|language=Norwegian|trans-title=Electric Vehicle Boom in Norway|author=Stian Hæreid Espeland |publisher=Bladet|date=2013-09-19|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of 1,412 all-electric cars registered in the country during the first quarter of 2013, 269 were used imports, representing 19% of all registrations during this quarter.&lt;ref name=Norway1Q2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elbil.no/elbiler/958-elbilsuksessen-fortsetter|title=Elbilsuksessen fortsetter|trans-title=Electric vehicle success continues|publisher=Grønn bil|date=2013-04-05|accessdate=2013-04-06|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, several French news outlets reported that according to the Norwegian newspaper [[Dagens Næringsliv]], some car dealers in Norway have been buying electric cars in France and earning the {{euro|7,000}} (~ {{USD|9,465}}) [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#France|government subsidy]]. These cars are then imported to Norway and after discounting the freight costs, they are sold at a discount. Dagens Næringsliv cited the case of one dealer near Oslo with 70% of its electric car sales corresponding to vehicles imported from France, and with at least 40 Leafs imported, totaling {{euro|280,000}} ( ~ {{USD|378,600}}) in benefits at a cost of the French taxpayers. These dealers are taking advantage of a [[loophole]] in the French law, which only requires to have an address in the country when buying a new car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.challenges.fr/economie/20130919.CHA4550/la-france-subventionne-des-voitures-electriques-qui-roulent-en-norvege.html|title=Comment la France subventionne des voitures en Norvège|language=French|trans-title=How France subsidizes cars in Norway|author=[[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP)|work=Challenges (France)|date=2013-09-19|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lesechos.fr/entreprises-secteurs/auto-transport/actu/0203016269296-quand-l-etat-francais-subventionne-les-voitures-electriques-en-norvege-607341.php|title=Quand l'Etat français subventionne les voitures électriques en Norvège|language=French|trans-title=When the French government subsidizes electric cars in Norway|first=Maxime|last=Amiot|work=[[Les Échos (France)]]|date=2013-09-20|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loophole to EU regulations===
[[File:Kia Soul EV Tromso 10 2018 2164.jpg|thumb|During 2015 a total of 2,044 used [[Kia Soul EV]]s were imported in Norway, mainly from Germany.&lt;ref name=NorskPHEV2015/&gt;]]

According to [[Der Spiegel]], by the early fourth quarter of 2015 the [[Kia Soul EV]] ranked as the top selling [[plug-in electric car]] in Germany during 2015 with 2,459 units sold, with almost 1,000 registered in October, nevertheless, there were actually only a few of them on German roads. At the time, about 1,400 Soul EVs had been shipped to Norway and sold as used cars, where availability of new Soul EVs is limited. According to the magazine, [[Kia Motors]] is registering the electric cars in Germany and then shipping them to Norway, which does not belong to the [[European Union]], as a strategy to reduce the average {{CO2}} fleet emissions of the entire [[Hyundai-Kia Group]]. This strategy allows the carmaker to comply with European Union regulations that mandate 130 grams of {{CO2}} emission per km in 2015, and so they avoid to pay a fine of {{euro|70 million}} per year for each gram above the established average limit. According to German authorities this loophole is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/hyundai-poliert-co2-flottenverbrauch-mit-kia-soul-ev-export-a-1064766.html |title=Dubiose Zulassungs-Strategie:Dieser Ladenhüter trickst Kias Umweltbilanz schön |language=German|trans-title=Dubious approval strategy: This dealer is tricking beautifully Kia's environmental balance |author1=Nils-Viktor Sorge  |author2=Wilfried Eckl-Dorna  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=2015-11-26|accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 2,044 Kia Soul EVs were imported to Norway as used cars during 2015.&lt;ref name=NorskPHEV2015/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3619">The '''Poland National Renewable Energy Action Plan''' is the [[National Renewable Energy Action Plan]] (NREAP) for [[Poland]]. The plan was commissioned by the [[Directive 2009/28/EC]] which required [[Member States of the European Union]] to notify the [[European Commission]] with a road map. The report describes how Poland planned to achieve its legally binding target of a 15% share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy by 2020. 
[[File:Farma Wiatrowa Ostrowo.jpg|thumb|280px|Renewable energy in the EU28. Wind farm in Ostrowo, Poland]]

== Main targets in Poland ==
Poland national target for the share of renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy in 2020 is 15%. The expected total energy consumption in 2020 is 69,200 ktoe and hence the amount of energy from renewable sources in target year 2020 should be 10,380.5 ktoe. National Renewable Energy Action Plan sets a target of the share of renewable energies to be 19.13% in electricity sector, 17.05% in heating/cooling sector and 10.14% in transport sector by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/8-10032014-AP/EN/8-10032014-AP-EN.PDF  Renewable energy in the EU28] 10 March 2014.

{{Infobox potassium}}
'''Potassium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''K''' (from [[New Latin|Neo-Latin]] ''[[wikt:kalium#Latin|kalium]]'') and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;19. It was first isolated from [[potash]], the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the [[periodic table]], potassium is one of the [[alkali metal]]s. All of the alkali metals have a single [[valence electron]] in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge – a [[cation]], which combines with [[anion]]s to form [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that [[redox|oxidizes]] rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite [[hydrogen]] emitted in the reaction, and burning with a [[lilac]]-[[flame color|colored flame]].  It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight&lt;ref name="seawaterconcentration"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[The Journal of Experimental Biology]] |url= http://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/16/2/178.full.pdf |title=The Sodium and Potassium Content of Sea Water |first=D. A. |last= Webb |page= 183 |date=April 1939 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/seawater.htm |title=Detailed composition of seawater at 3.5% salinity |first= J. |last= Anthoni |work=seafriends.org.nz |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and is part of many [[mineral]]s.

Potassium is chemically very similar to [[sodium]], the previous element in group 1 of the periodic table. They have a similar first [[ionization energy]], which allows for each atom to give up its sole outer electron. That they are different elements that combine with the same [[anion]]s to make similar salts was suspected in 1702,&lt;ref name="1702Suspect" /&gt; and was proven in 1807 using [[electrolysis]]. Naturally occurring potassium is composed of three [[isotope]]s, of which [[potassium-40|{{chem|40|K}}]] is [[radioactive]]. Traces of {{chem|40|K}} are found in all potassium, and it is the most common [[radioisotope]] in the human body.

Potassium ions are vital for the functioning of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous signs and symptoms, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiographic]] abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium. The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises [[serum (blood)|serum]] potassium levels, with a shift of potassium from outside to inside cells and an increase in potassium excretion by the kidneys.

Most industrial applications of potassium exploit the high [[solubility]] in water of potassium compounds, such as [[Saltwater soap|potassium]] [[soap]]s. Heavy crop production rapidly depletes the soil of potassium, and this can be remedied with agricultural fertilizers containing potassium, accounting for 95% of global potassium chemical production.&lt;ref name="g73"&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The English name for the element ''potassium'' comes from the word "[[potash]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Humphry|last=Davy|title=On some new phenomena of chemical changes produced by electricity, in particular the decomposition of the fixed alkalies, and the exhibition of the new substances that constitute their bases; and on the general nature of alkaline bodies|page=32|year=1808|volume=98|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA32|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to an early method of extracting various potassium salts: placing in a ''pot'' the ''ash'' of burnt wood or tree leaves, adding water, heating, and evaporating the solution. When [[Humphry Davy]] first isolated the pure element using [[electrolysis]] in 1807, he named it ''potassium'', which he derived from the word potash.

The symbol "K" stems from ''kali'', itself from the root word ''[[alkali]]'', which in turn comes from ''{{lang-ar|القَلْيَه}}'' ''al-qalyah'' "plant ashes."  In 1797, the German chemist  [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth|Martin Klaproth]] discovered "potash" in the minerals [[leucite]] and [[lepidolite]], and realized that "potash" was not a product of plant growth but actually contained a new element, which he proposed to call ''kali''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Klaproth (1797) "Nouvelles données relatives à l'histoire naturelle de l'alcali végétal" (New data regarding the natural history of the vegetable alkali), ''Mémoires de l'Académie royale des sciences et belles-lettres'' (Berlin), pp. 9-13 ; [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015073704093;view=1up;seq=103 see p. 13.]  From p. 13:  ''"Cet alcali ne pouvant donc plus être envisagé comme un produit de la végétation dans les plantes, occupe une place propre dans la série des substances primitivement simples du règne minéral, &amp;I il devient nécessaire de lui assigner un nom, qui convienne mieux à sa nature.&lt;br&gt;
''La dénomination de ''Potasche'' (potasse) que la nouvelle nomenclature françoise a consacrée comme nom de tout le genre, ne sauroit faire fortune auprès des chimistes allemands, qui sentent à quel point la dérivation étymologique en est vicieuse.  Elle est prise en effet de ce qu'anciennement on se servoit pour la calcination des lessives concentrées des cendres, de pots de fer (''pott'' en dialecte de la Basse-Saxe) auxquels on a substitué depuis des fours à calciner.&lt;br&gt;
''Je propose donc ici, de substituer aux mots usités jusqu'ici d'alcali des plantes, alcali végétal, potasse, &amp;c. celui de ''kali'', &amp; de revenir à l'ancienne dénomination de ''natron'', au lieu de dire alcali minéral, soude &amp;c."''&lt;br&gt;
(This alkali [i.e., potash] — [which] therefore can no longer be viewed as a product of growth in plants — occupies a proper place in the originally simple series of the mineral realm, and it becomes necessary to assign it a name that is better suited to its nature.&lt;br&gt;
The name of "potash" (''potasse''), which the new French nomenclature has bestowed as the name of the entire species [i.e., substance], would not find acceptance among German chemists, who feel to some extent [that] the etymological derivation of it is faulty. Indeed, it is taken from [the vessels] that one formerly used for the roasting of washing powder concentrated from cinders: iron pots (''pott'' in the dialect of Lower Saxony), for which roasting ovens have been substituted since then.&lt;br&gt;
Thus I now propose to substitute for the until now common words of "plant alkali", "vegetable alkali", "potash", etc., that of ''kali'' ; and to return to the old name of ''natron'' instead of saying "mineral alkali", "soda", etc.)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1807, [[Humphry Davy]] produced the element via electrolysis: in 1809, [[Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert]] proposed the name ''Kalium'' for Davy's "potassium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davy, Humphry |year=1809|title=Ueber einige neue Erscheinungen chemischer Veränderungen, welche durch die Electricität bewirkt werden; insbesondere über die Zersetzung der feuerbeständigen Alkalien, die Darstellung der neuen Körper, welche ihre Basen ausmachen, und die Natur der Alkalien überhaupt|trans-title=On some new phenomena of chemical changes that are achieved by electricity; particularly the decomposition of flame-resistant alkalis [i.e., alkalies that cannot be reduced to their base metals by flames], the preparation of new substances that constitute their [metallic] bases, and the nature of alkalies generally|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=31|issue=2|pages=113–175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyswAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA157|quote=p. 157:  In unserer deutschen Nomenclatur würde ich die Namen ''Kalium'' und ''Natronium'' vorschlagen, wenn man nicht lieber bei den von Herrn Erman gebrauchten und von mehreren angenommenen Benennungen ''Kali-Metalloid'' and ''Natron-Metalloid'', bis zur völligen Aufklärung der chemischen Natur dieser räthzelhaften Körper bleiben will.  Oder vielleicht findet man es noch zweckmässiger fürs Erste zwei Klassen zu machen, ''Metalle'' und ''Metalloide'', und in die letztere ''Kalium'' und ''Natronium'' zu setzen. — Gilbert. (In our German nomenclature, I would suggest the names ''Kalium'' and ''Natronium'', if one would not rather continue with the appellations ''Kali-metalloid'' and ''Natron-metalloid'' which are used by Mr. Erman [i.e., German physics professor [[Paul Erman]] (1764–1851)] and accepted by several [people], until the complete clarification of the chemical nature of these puzzling substances.  Or perhaps one finds it yet more advisable for the present to create two classes, ''metals'' and ''metalloids'', and to place ''Kalium'' and ''Natronium'' in the latter — Gilbert.)|bibcode=1809AnP....31..113D|doi=10.1002/andp.18090310202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1814, the Swedish chemist  [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius|Berzelius]] advocated the name ''kalium'' for potassium, with the chemical symbol "K".&lt;ref&gt;Berzelius, J. Jacob (1814) ''Försök, att, genom användandet af den electrokemiska theorien och de kemiska proportionerna, grundlägga ett rent vettenskapligt system för mineralogien'' [Attempt, by the use of electrochemical theory and chemical proportions, to found a pure scientific system for mineralogy]. Stockholm, Sweden:  A. Gadelius., [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_Uw0-AAAAcAAJ#page/n91/mode/2up p. 87.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The English and French speaking countries adopted Davy and Gay-Lussac/Thénard's name Potassium, while the Germanic countries adopted Gilbert/Klaproth's name Kalium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanderkrogt.net/elements/element.php?sym=K 19.

==Properties==
===Physical===
[[File:FlammenfärbungK.png|thumb|right|The [[flame test]] of potassium.]]
Potassium is the second least dense metal after [[lithium]]. It is a soft solid with a low [[melting point]], and can be easily cut with a knife. Freshly cut potassium is silvery in appearance, but it begins to tarnish toward gray immediately on exposure to air.&lt;ref name=g76&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[flame test]], potassium and its compounds emit a lilac color with a peak emission wavelength of 766.5 nanometers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Potassium concentration in solution is commonly determined using [[photoelectric flame photometer|flame photometry]], [[atomic absorption spectrophotometry]], [[inductively coupled plasma]], or [[ion selective electrode]]s. --&gt;

===Chemical===

Neutral potassium atoms have 19 electrons, one more than the extremely stable configuration of the [[noble gas]] [[argon]]. Because of this and its low first [[ionization energy]] of 418.8&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, the potassium atom is much more likely to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a negative charge (though negatively charged [[alkalide]] {{chem|K|−}} ions are not impossible).&lt;ref name="K-"&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]]|year = 1979|last = Dye|first=J. L. |title = Compounds of Alkali Metal Anions|volume = 18|issue = 8|pages = 587–598|doi = 10.1002/anie.197905871}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="K+++"&gt;{{cite book|first1=A. M.| last1=James|first2=M. P.|last2=Lord|title=Macmillan's chemical and physical data|publisher=Macmillan| location=London| date=1992|isbn=0-333-51167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process requires so little energy that potassium is readily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high (3052&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol), because removal of two electrons breaks the stable noble gas electronic configuration (the configuration of the inert argon).&lt;ref name="K+++"/&gt; Potassium therefore does not form compounds with the oxidation state of +2 or higher.&lt;ref name="K-"/&gt;

Potassium is an extremely active metal that reacts violently with oxygen in water and air. With oxygen it forms [[potassium peroxide]], and with water potassium forms [[potassium hydroxide]]. The reaction of potassium with water is dangerous because of its violent [[exothermic]] character and the production of [[hydrogen]] gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium-potassium ([[NaK]]) alloy are potent [[desiccant]]s that can be used to dry [[solvent]]s prior to distillation.&lt;ref name=b35&gt;[[#Burkhardt|Burkhardt]], p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the sensitivity of potassium to water and air, reactions with other elements are possible only in an inert atmosphere such as [[argon]] gas using [[air-free technique]]s. Potassium does not react with most hydrocarbons such as mineral oil or [[kerosene]].&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first1 = Arnold F.|last1 = Holleman|last2 = Wiberg|first2 = Egon|last3 = Wiberg|first3 = Nils|chapter = Potassium| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; It readily dissolves in liquid [[ammonia]], up to 480 g per 1000 g of ammonia at 0&amp;nbsp;°C. Depending on the concentration, the ammonia solutions are blue to yellow, and their electrical conductivity is similar to that of liquid metals. In a pure solution, potassium slowly reacts with ammonia to form {{chem|KNH|2}}, but this reaction is accelerated by minute amounts of transition metal salts.&lt;ref name=b32&gt;[[#Burkhardt|Burkhardt]], p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Because it can reduce the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s to the metal, potassium is often used as the reductant in the preparation of finely divided metals from their salts by the [[Rieke metal|Rieke method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rieke, R. D.|title=Preparation of Organometallic Compounds from Highly Reactive Metal Powders|journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|year= 1989|volume= 246| pages= 1260–4|doi=10.1126/science.246.4935.1260| pmid=17832221| issue=4935|bibcode = 1989Sci...246.1260R }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the preparation of magnesium by this method employs potassium as the reductant:

:{{chem|link=Magnesium chloride|MgCl|2}}  +  2 K  →  Mg  +  2 KCl

====Compounds====
:[[Image:potassium-superoxide-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png|thumb|right|upright|Structure of solid potassium superoxide ({{chem|KO|2}}).]]
The only common oxidation state for potassium is +1. Potassium metal is a powerful [[reducing agent]] that is easily oxidized to the monopositive [[cation]], {{chem|K|+}}. Once oxidized, it is very stable and difficult to reduce back to the metal.&lt;ref name="K-"/&gt;

Potassium oxidizes faster than most metals and often forms [[oxide]]s containing oxygen-oxygen bonds, as do all alkali metals except lithium. There are three possible oxides of potassium: [[potassium oxide]] (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[potassium peroxide]] (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[potassium superoxide]] (KO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Lide|first = David R.|date = 1998|title = Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|edition = 87th|publication-place = Boca Raton, Florida, United States|publisher = CRC Press|isbn = 0-8493-0594-2|pages = 477; 520}}&lt;/ref&gt; they contain three different oxygen-based ions: [[oxide]] ({{chem|O|2-}}), [[peroxide]] ({{chem|O|2|2-}}), and [[superoxide]] ({{chem|O|2|-}}). The latter two species, especially the [[superoxide]], are rare and are formed only in reaction of very [[electronegativity|electropositive]] metals (Na, K, Rb, Cs, etc.) with oxygen; these species contain oxygen-oxygen bonds.&lt;ref name=b32/&gt; All potassium-oxygen binary compounds are known to react with water violently, forming [[potassium hydroxide]].

Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a very strong alkali, and up to 1.21&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] of it can dissolve in merely one liter of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{RubberBible86th|page=4–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schultz|Schultz]], p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; KOH reacts readily with carbon dioxide to produce [[potassium carbonate]], and is used to remove traces of the gas from air.

In general, potassium compounds are highly ionic and, owing to the high hydration energy of the {{chem|K|+}} ion, have excellent water solubility. The main species in water solution are the aquated complexes {{chem|[K|(H|2|O)|n|]|+}} where n = 6 and 7.&lt;ref name=Lincoln&gt;Lincoln, S. F.; Richens, D. T. and Sykes, A. G. "Metal Aqua Ions" in J. A. McCleverty and T. J. Meyer (eds.)

===Isotopes===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Uranium]]--&gt;
{{main|Isotopes of potassium}}
There are 24 known [[isotope]]s of potassium, three of which occur naturally: {{chem|39|K}} (93.3%), {{chem|40|K}} (0.0117%), and {{chem|41|K}} (6.7%). Naturally occurring {{chem|link=potassium-40|40|K}} has a [[half-life]] of 1.250×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years. It decays to stable {{chem|link=Argon|40|Ar}} by [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]] (11.2%) or to stable {{chem|link=Calcium|40|Ca}} by [[beta decay]] (88.8%).&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center|year = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A. H.| url = http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decay of {{chem|40|K}} to {{chem|40|Ar}} is the basis of a common method for dating rocks. The conventional [[Potassium-argon dating|K-Ar dating method]] depends on the assumption that the rocks contained no argon at the time of formation and that all the subsequent radiogenic argon ({{chem|40|Ar}}) was quantitatively retained. [[Mineral]]s are dated by measurement of the concentration of potassium and the amount of radiogenic {{chem|40|Ar}} that has accumulated. The minerals best suited for dating include [[biotite]], [[muscovite]], metamorphic [[hornblende]], and volcanic [[feldspar]]; [[Petrography|whole rock]] samples from volcanic flows and shallow [[Igneous rock|instrusives]] can also be dated if they are unaltered.&lt;ref name="NUBASE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k90iAnFereYC&amp;pg=PA207|pages =203–8|chapter= Theory and Assumptions in Potassium–Argon Dating|title = Isotopes in the Earth Sciences|isbn = 978-0-412-53710-3|last1 = Bowen|first1 = Robert|last2 = Attendorn|first2 = H. G.|date = 1988|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from dating, potassium isotopes have been used as [[radioactive tracer|tracers]] in studies of [[weathering]] and for [[nutrient cycling]] studies because potassium is a [[macronutrient (ecology)|macronutrient]] required for [[life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anaç, D.|author2=Martin-Prével, P.|last-author-amp=yes |title=Improved crop quality by nutrient management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Hr4w6QhPGsC&amp;pg=PA290|date=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-5850-3|pages=290–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{chem|40|K}} occurs in natural potassium (and thus in some commercial salt substitutes) in sufficient quantity that large bags of those substitutes can be used as a radioactive source for classroom demonstrations. {{chem|40|K}} is the radioisotope with the largest abundance in the body. In healthy animals and people, {{chem|40|K}} represents the largest source of radioactivity, greater even than {{chem|link=Carbon-14|14|C}}.

==Potash==
{{main|Potash}}
Potash is primarily a mixture of potassium salts because plants have little or no sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702,&lt;ref name="1702Suspect"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b-ATAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA167|page = 167|title = Chymische Schriften|last1 = Marggraf|first = Andreas Siegmund|date = 1761}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau]] was able to prove this difference in 1736.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3533j/f73.image.r=Memoires%20de%20l%27Academie%20royale%20des%20Sciences.langEN|journal = Memoires de l'Academie royale des Sciences| title = Sur la Base de Sel Marin| last = du Monceau|first = H.

==Metal==
[[File:Sir Humphry Davy, Bt by Thomas Phillips.jpg|thumb| left|[[Humphry Davy]] ]]
[[File:Potassium.JPG|thumb|right|Pieces of potassium metal]]
Potassium ''metal'' was first isolated in 1807 by Sir [[Humphry Davy]], who derived it from [[Potassium hydroxide|caustic potash]] (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by electrolysis of molten KOH with the newly discovered [[voltaic pile]]. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis.&lt;ref name="Enghag2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Enghag|first= P.|date=2004| title=Encyclopedia of the elements| publisher=Wiley-VCH Weinheim| isbn=3-527-30666-8| chapter=11.

==Geology==
Elemental potassium does not occur in nature because of its high reactivity. It reacts violently with water (see section Precautions below)&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt; and also reacts with oxygen. [[Orthoclase]] (potassium feldspar) is a common rock-forming mineral. [[Granite]] for example contains 5% potassium, which is well above the average in the Earth's crust. [[Sylvite]] (KCl), [[carnallite]] {{chem|(KCl·MgCl|2|·6(H|2|O))}}, [[kainite]] {{chem|(MgSO|4|·KCl·3H|2|O)}} and [[langbeinite]] {{chem|(MgSO|4|·K|2|SO|4|)}} are the minerals found in large [[evaporite]] deposits worldwide. The deposits often show layers starting with the least soluble at the bottom and the most soluble on top.&lt;ref name="indus"/&gt; Deposits of niter ([[potassium nitrate]]) are formed by decomposition of organic material in contact with atmosphere, mostly in caves; because of the good water solubility of niter the formation of larger deposits requires special environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NyUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA134|pages = 134–145| chapter = The Origin of Nitrate Deposits| first = William H.| last = Ross|title = Popular Science|date = 1914|publisher=Bonnier Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological role==
{{Main|Potassium in biology}}
Potassium is the eighth or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) in the human body, so that a 60&amp;nbsp;kg adult contains a total of about 120&amp;nbsp;g of potassium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0883-2889(92)90208-V|title = A simple calibration of a whole-body counter for the measurement of total body potassium in humans|year = 1992|display-authors = 4|last1 = Abdel-Wahab|first1 = M.|last2 = Youssef|first2 = S.|last3 = Aly|first3 = A.|last4 = el-Fiki|first4 = S.|last5 = el-Enany|first5 = N.|last6 = Abbas|first6 = M.|journal = International Journal of Radiation Applications and Instrumentation.

===Homeostasis===
Potassium homeostasis denotes the maintenance of the total body potassium content, plasma potassium level, and the ratio of the intracellular to extracellular potassium concentrations within narrow limits, in the face of pulsatile intake (meals), obligatory renal excretion, and shifts between intracellular and extracellular compartments.

====Plasma levels====
Plasma potassium is normally kept at 3.5 to 5.0 millimoles (mmol) [or milliequivalents (mEq)] per liter by multiple mechanisms. Levels outside this range are associated with an increasing rate of death from multiple causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goyal | first1 = Abhinav | last2 = Spertus | first2 = John A. | last3 = Gosch | first3 = Kensey | last4 = Venkitachalam | first4 = Lakshmi | last5 = Jones | first5 = Philip G. | last6 = Van den Berghe | first6 = Greet | last7 = Kosiborod | first7 = Mikhail | year = 2012 | title = Serum Potassium Levels and Mortality in Acute Myocardial Infarction | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 307 | issue = 2| pages = 157–164 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2011.1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some cardiac, kidney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smyth | first1 = A. | last2 = Dunkler | first2 = D. | last3 = Gao | first3 = P. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2014 | title = The relationship between estimated sodium and potassium excretion and subsequent renal outcomes | url = | journal = Kidney Int | volume = 86 | issue = 6| pages = 1205–1212 | doi=10.1038/ki.2014.214}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lung diseases progress more rapidly if serum potassium levels are not maintained within the normal range.

An average meal of 40-50&amp;nbsp;mmol presents the body with more potassium than is present in all plasma (20-25&amp;nbsp;mmol). However, this surge causes the plasma potassium to rise only 10% at most as a result of prompt and efficient clearance by both renal and extra-renal mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore-Ede | first1 = M. C. | year = 1986 | title = Physiology of the circadian timing system: predictive versus reactive homeostasis | url = | journal = Am J Physiol | volume = 250 | issue = | pages = R737–R752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hypokalemia]], a deficiency of potassium in the plasma, can be fatal if severe. Common causes are increased gastrintestinal loss ([[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]]), and increased renal loss ([[polyuria|diuresis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_XavFllbnS0C&amp;pg=PA812|page = 812| chapter = Potassium|title = Pediatric critical care medicine|isbn = 978-0-7817-9469-5|last1 = Slonim|first1= Anthony D.|last2 = Pollack|first2= Murray M.|date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness, [[paralytic ileus]], ECG abnormalities, decreased reflex response; and in severe cases, respiratory paralysis, [[alkalosis]], and [[cardiac arrhythmia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c4xAdJhIi6oC&amp;pg=PT257 |page =257|chapter = hypokalemia |title = Essentials of Nephrology|edition=2nd|publisher=BI Publications |isbn = 978-81-7225-323-3 |last1 = Visveswaran |first1= Kasi |date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Control mechanisms====
Potassium content in the plasma is tightly controlled by four basic mechanisms, which have various names and classifications.  The four are 1) a reactive negative-feedback system, 2) a reactive feed-forward system, 3) a predictive or [[circadian]] system, and 4) an internal  or cell membrane transport system. Collectively, the first three are sometimes termed the "external potassium homeostasis system";{{Citation needed|date=May 2016|reason=internal cell mechanism is "external??  No citations found on web.}} and the first two, the "reactive potassium homeostasis system".
* The reactive negative-feedback system refers to the system that induces renal secretion of potassium in response to a rise in the plasma potassium (potassium ingestion, shift out of cells, or intravenous infusion.)
* The reactive feed-forward system refers to an incompletely understood system that induces renal potassium secretion in response to potassium ingestion prior to any rise in the plasma potassium. This is probably initiated by gut cell potassium receptors that detect ingested potassium and trigger [[vagal]] [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] signals to the pituitary gland.
* The predictive or circadian system increases renal secretion of potassium during mealtime hours (e.g. daytime for humans, nighttime for rodents) independent of the presence, amount, or absence of potassium ingestion. It is mediated by a [[circadian oscillator]] in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] of the brain (central clock), which causes the kidney (peripheral clock) to secrete potassium in this rhythmic circadian fashion.[[File:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary [[active transport]]. The two carrier proteins embedded in the cell membrane on the left are using [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to move sodium out of the cell against the concentration gradient; The two proteins on the right are using secondary active transport to move potassium into the cell: this process results in reconstitution of ATP.]]
* The ion transport system moves potassium across the cell membrane using two mechanisms. One is active and pumps sodium out of, and potassium into, the cell. The other is passive and allows potassium to leak out of the cell. Potassium and sodium cations influence fluid distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments by [[osmotic]] forces. The movement of potassium and sodium through the cell membrane is mediated by the [[Na+/K+-ATPase]] pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Neil|title=Biology|date=1987|isbn=0-8053-1840-2|page=795|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co.|location=Menlo Park, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Ion transporter|ion pump]] uses [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to pump three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell, creating an electrochemical gradient and electromotive force across the cell membrane. The highly selective [[potassium ion channels]] (which are [[tetramer]]s) are crucial for [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] inside [[neuron]]s after an action potential is triggered, to cite one example. The most recently discovered potassium ion channel is KirBac3.1, which makes a total of five potassium ion channels (KcsA, KirBac1.1, KirBac3.1, KvAP, and MthK) with a determined structure. All five are from [[prokaryotic]] species.&lt;ref name="pmid16253415"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Mikko |last1 = Hellgren| first2= Lars |last2= Sandberg|first3= Olle |last3= Edholm|title=A comparison between two prokaryotic potassium channels (K&lt;sub&gt;ir&lt;/sub&gt;Bac1.1 and KcsA) in a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study|journal=Biophysical Chemistry| volume=120|issue=1|pages=1–9|year=2006|pmid=16253415|doi=10.1016/j.bpc.2005.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Renal filtration, reabsorption, and excretion====
Renal handling of potassium is closely connected to sodium handling. Potassium is the major cation (positive ion) inside animal cells [150&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, (4.8&amp;nbsp;g)], while sodium is the major cation of extracellular fluid [150&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, (3.345&amp;nbsp;g)]. In the kidneys, about 180&amp;nbsp;liters of plasma is filtered through the [[glomeruli]] and into the [[renal tubules]] per day.&lt;ref name="Potts1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Potts, W. T. W.|author2=Parry, G.|date=1964|title=Osmotic and ionic regulation in animals|publisher=[[Pergamon Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This filtering involves about 600&amp;nbsp;g of sodium and 33&amp;nbsp;g of potassium. Since only 1–10&amp;nbsp;g of sodium and 1–4&amp;nbsp;g of potassium are likely to be replaced by diet, renal filtering must efficiently reabsorb the remainder from the plasma.

Sodium is reabsorbed to maintain extracellular volume, osmotic pressure, and serum sodium concentration within narrow limits; potassium is reabsorbed to maintain serum potassium concentration within narrow limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Lans |first1=H.

The potassium moves passively through pores in the cell membrane. When ions move through pumps there is a gate in the pumps on either side of the cell membrane and only one gate can be open at once. As a result, approximately 100 ions are forced through per second. Pores have only one gate, and there only one kind of ion can stream through, at 10 million to 100 million ions per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gadsby |first=D.

==Nutrition==

===Dietary recommendations===
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) sets Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), or [[Adequate Intake]]s (AIs) for when there is not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s. The AIs for potassium are: 400&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for 0-6-month-old males, 700&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for 7-12-month-old males, 3,000&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for 1-3-year-old males, 3,800&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for 4-8-year-old males, 4,500&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for 9-13-year-old males, and 4,700&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for males that are 14 years old and older.
The AIs for potassium are: 400&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for 0-6-month-old females, 700&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for 7-12-month-old females, 3,000&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for 1-3-year-old females, 3,800&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for 4-8-year-old females, 4,500&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for 9-13-year-old females, and 4,700&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for females that are 14 years old and older.
The AIs for potassium are: 4,700&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for 14-50-year-old pregnant females; furthermore, 5,100&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium for 14-50-year-old lactating females. As for safety, the IOM also sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals, but for potassium the evidence was insufficient, so no UL established.&lt;ref&gt;Potassium. IN: [https://www.nap.edu/read/10925/chapter/7 Dietary Reference Intakes for Water, Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Sulfate]. National Academy Press. 2005, PP.186-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Americans consume only half that amount per day.&lt;ref name=iom_panel2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Panel on Dietary Reference Intakes for Electrolytes and Water, Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, Food and Nutrition|title=DRI, dietary reference intakes for water, potassium, sodium, chloride, and sulfate|date=2004|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-309-53049-0|url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-Water-Potassium-Sodium-Chloride-and-Sulfate.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006174858/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-Water-Potassium-Sodium-Chloride-and-Sulfate.aspx|archivedate=2011-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, in the [[European Union]], in particular in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], insufficient potassium intake is somewhat common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karger|first=S.|journal=Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism|year=2004|volume=48|issue=2 (suppl) |pages=1–16 |title=Energy and nutrient intake in the European Union|doi=10.1159/000083041}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[National Health Service|British National Health Service]] recommends a lower intake, saying that adults need 3,500&amp;nbsp;mg per day and that excess amounts may cause health problems such as stomach pain and diarrhoea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/others/#potassium%20NHS%20Choices%20-%20Other%20vitamins%20and%20minerals%20-%20Potassium https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/others/#potassium NHS Choices - Other vitamins and minerals - Potassium]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food sources===
Potassium is present in all fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. Foods with high potassium concentrations include [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[parsley]], dried [[apricot]]s, [[milk]], [[chocolate]], all [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] (especially [[almond]]s and [[pistachio]]s), [[potato]]es, [[bamboo shoot]]s, [[banana]]s, [[avocado]]s, [[coconut water]], [[soybean]]s, and [[bran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/info/books-phds/books/foodfacts/html/data/data5b.html|title = Potassium Food Charts|publisher =Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition|accessdate = 2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] lists [[tomato paste]], [[orange juice]], [[beet greens]], [[white beans]], [[potato]]es, [[Cooking banana|plantains]], [[banana]]s, apricots, and many other dietary sources of potassium, ranked in descending order according to potassium content. A day's worth of potassium is in 5 plantains or 11 bananas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Potassium Content of Selected Foods per Common Measure, sorted by nutrient content |publisher=USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 20 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/SR20/nutrlist/sr20w306.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217043521/http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/SR20/nutrlist/sr20w306.pdf |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deficient intake===
Diets low in potassium can lead to [[hypertension]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Whelton PK, He J, Cutler JA, Brancati FL, Appel LJ, Follmann D, Klag MJ |title=Effects of oral potassium on blood pressure. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials |journal=JAMA |volume=277 |issue=20 |pages=1624–32 |year=1997 |pmid=9168293 |doi=10.1001/jama.1997.03540440058033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hypokalemia]].

===Supplementation===
Supplements of potassium are most widely used in conjunction with [[diuretic]]s that block reabsorption of sodium and water upstream from the [[distal tubule]] ([[thiazide]]s and [[loop diuretics]]), because this promotes increased distal tubular potassium secretion, with resultant increased potassium excretion. A variety of prescription and over-the counter supplements are available.  Potassium chloride may be dissolved in water, but the salty/bitter taste make liquid supplements unpalatable.&lt;ref name=bitter/&gt; Typical doses range from 10&amp;nbsp;mmol (400&amp;nbsp;mg), to 20&amp;nbsp;mmol (800&amp;nbsp;mg).  Potassium is also available in tablets or capsules, which are formulated to allow potassium to leach slowly out of a matrix, since very high concentrations of potassium ion that occur adjacent to a solid tablet can injure the gastric or intestinal mucosa. For this reason, non-prescription potassium pills are limited by law in the US to a maximum of 99&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Since the kidneys are the site of potassium excretion, individuals with impaired kidney function are at risk for [[hyperkalemia]] if dietary potassium and supplements are not restricted. The more severe the impairment, the more severe is the restriction necessary to avoid hyperkalemia.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

A [[meta-analysis]] concluded that a 1640&amp;nbsp;mg increase in the daily intake of potassium was associated with a 21% lower risk of stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=D'Elia |first1=L. |last2=Barba |first2=G. |last3=Cappuccio |first3=F. |last4=Strazzullo |year=2011 |title=Potassium Intake, Stroke, and Cardiovascular Disease: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies |journal=J Am Coll Cardiol |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=1210–9 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2010.09.070 |pmid=21371638}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Potassium chloride]] and [[potassium bicarbonate]] may be useful to control mild [[hypertension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=He FJ, Marciniak M, Carney C, Markandu ND, Anand V, Fraser WD, Dalton RN, Kaski JC, MacGregor GA |title=Effects of potassium chloride and potassium bicarbonate on endothelial function, cardiovascular risk factors, and bone turnover in mild hypertensives |journal=Hypertension |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=681–8 |year=2010 |pmid=20083724 |doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.147488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection by taste buds===
Potassium can be detected by taste because it triggers three of the five types of taste sensations, according to concentration. Dilute solutions of potassium ions taste sweet, allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices, while higher concentrations become increasingly bitter/alkaline, and finally also salty to the taste. The combined bitterness and saltiness of high-potassium solutions makes high-dose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge.&lt;ref name=bitter&gt;{{cite book|author1=Institute of Medicine (U.S.).

===Mining===
[[File:Museo de La Plata - Silvita.jpg|thumb|right| [[Sylvite]] from New Mexico]]
Potassium salts such as [[carnallite]], [[langbeinite]], [[polyhalite]], and [[sylvite]] form extensive [[evaporite]] deposits in ancient lake bottoms and [[seabed]]s,&lt;ref name=geo/&gt; making extraction of potassium salts in these environments commercially viable. The principal source of potassium – [[potash]] – is mined in [[Canada]], [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[United States]], [[Jordan]], and other places around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EHx51n3T858C|publisher=Springer|title = Potash: deposits, processing, properties and uses|isbn = 978-0-412-99071-7|last1 = Garrett|first1= Donald E.|date = 1995-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USGSCS2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/potash/mcs-2008-potas.pdf|first=Joyce A.|last=Ober|publisher=United States Geological Survey|title=Mineral Commodity Summaries 2008:Potash|accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USGSYB2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/potash/myb1-2006-potas.pdf|first=Joyce A.|last=Ober|publisher=United States Geological Survey|title=Mineral Yearbook 2006:Potash|accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mined deposits were located near Staßfurt, Germany, but the deposits span from [[Great Britain]] over Germany into Poland.

===Chemical extraction===
Several methods are used to separate potassium salts from sodium and magnesium compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in [[slag heap]]s. Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as [[potassium chloride]] after processing. The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.&lt;ref name="indus"/&gt;

Pure potassium metal can be isolated by [[electrolysis]] of its [[potassium hydroxide|hydroxide]] in a process that has changed little since it was first used by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1807. Although the electrolysis process was developed and used in industrial scale in the 1920s, the thermal method by reacting sodium with [[potassium chloride]] in a chemical equilibrium reaction became the dominant method in the 1950s.

The production of [[NaK|sodium potassium alloys]] is accomplished by changing the reaction time and the amount of sodium used in the reaction. The Griesheimer process employing the reaction of [[potassium fluoride]] with [[calcium carbide]] was also used to produce potassium.&lt;ref name="indus" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1002/0471238961.1615200103080921.a01.pub2|isbn= 9780471238966

The market is volatile because long-term storage of the metal is difficult. It must be stored in a dry [[inert gas]] atmosphere or [[anhydrous]] [[mineral oil]] to prevent the formation of a surface layer of [[potassium superoxide]], a pressure-sensitive [[explosive]] that [[Detonation|detonates]] when scratched.

===Fertilizer===
[[File:Patentkali (Potassium sulfate with magnesium).jpg|thumb|Potassium sulfate/magnesium sulfate fertilizer]]
Potassium ions are an essential component of [[plant]] nutrition and are found in most [[soil]] types.&lt;ref name=g73/&gt; They are used as a [[fertilizer]] in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], and [[hydroponic]] culture in the form of [[potassium chloride|chloride]] (KCl), [[potassium sulfate|sulfate]] ({{chem|K|2|SO|4}}), or [[potassium nitrate|nitrate]] ({{chem|KNO|3}}). Agricultural fertilizers consume 95% of global potassium chemical production, and about 90% of this potassium is supplied as KCl.&lt;ref name=g73/&gt; The potassium content of most plants range from 0.5% to 2% of the harvested weight of crops, conventionally expressed as amount of {{chem|K|2|O}}. Modern high-[[Crop yield|yield]] agriculture depends upon fertilizers to replace the potassium lost at harvest. Most agricultural fertilizers contain potassium chloride, while potassium sulfate is used for chloride-sensitive crops or crops needing higher sulfur content. The sulfate is produced mostly by decomposition of the complex minerals [[kainite]] ({{chem|MgSO|4|·KCl·3H|2|O}}) and [[langbeinite]] ({{chem|MgSO|4|·K|2|SO|4}}). Only a very few fertilizers contain potassium nitrate.&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;{{cite book|pages = 1135–57|first = Amit H. |last = Roy| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AYjFoLCNHYUC&amp;pg=PA1135|isbn = 978-0-387-27843-8|publisher=Springer|title = Kent and Riegel's handbook of industrial chemistry and biotechnology|date = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, about 93% of world potassium production was consumed by the fertilizer industry.&lt;ref name="USGSYB2006" /&gt;

Potassium sodium tartrate ({{chem|KNaC|4|H|4|O|6}}, [[Rochelle salt]]) is the main constituent of [[baking powder]]; it is also used in the [[silvering]] of mirrors. [[Potassium bromate]] ({{chem|KBrO|3}}) is a strong oxidizer (E924), used to improve dough strength and rise height. [[Potassium bisulfite]] ({{chem|KHSO|3}}) is used as a food preservative, for example in [[wine]] and [[beer]]-making (but not in meats). It is also used to [[bleach]] textiles and straw, and in the tanning of [[leather]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XqKF7PqV02cC&amp;pg=PA86|page = 86|chapter = Bleaching and Maturing Agents|title = How Baking Works: Exploring the Fundamentals of Baking Science|isbn = 978-0-470-39267-6|author = Figoni, Paula I|date= 2010|publisher=John Wiley and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eblAtwEXffcC&amp;pg=PA4|publisher=Academic Press|pages = 4–6| chapter = Uses and Exposure to Sulfites in Food|title = Advances in food research|isbn = 978-0-12-016430-1|author = Chichester, C.

[[File:Potassium water 20.theora.ogv|thumb|alt=A piece of potassium metal is dropped into a clear container of water and skates around, burning with a bright pinkish or lilac flame for a short time until finishing with a pop and splash.|A reaction of potassium metal with water. Hydrogen is produced, and with potassium vapor, burns with a pink or lilac flame. Strongly alkaline potassium hydroxide is formed in solution.]]

Potassium metal reacts violently with water producing [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) and [[hydrogen]] gas.

:2 K (s) + 2 {{H2O}} (l) → 2 KOH (aq) + {{chem|H|2}}↑ (g)

This reaction is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen in the presence of oxygen, possibly explosively splashing onlookers with [[potassium hydroxide]], which is a strong [[alkali]] that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns. Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. [[Nitrogen]], [[argon]], [[sodium chloride]] (table salt), [[sodium carbonate]] (soda ash), and [[silicon dioxide]] (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some [[Fire extinguisher|Class D]] dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2fHsoobsCNwC&amp;pg=PA459 |page = 459| title = Fire and Life Safety Inspection Manual| isbn = 978-0-87765-472-8|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning| last = Solomon |first=Robert E.| date = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potassium reacts violently with [[halogens]] and detonates in the presence of [[bromine]]. It also reacts explosively with [[sulfuric acid]]. During combustion, potassium forms peroxides and superoxides. These peroxides may react violently with [[organic compound]]s such as oils. Both peroxides and superoxides may react explosively with metallic potassium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/ns/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081d.html |title=DOE Handbook-Alkali Metals Sodium, Potassium, NaK, and Lithium |publisher=Hss.doe.gov |accessdate=2010-10-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928002539/http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/ns/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081d.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because potassium reacts with water vapor in the air, it is usually stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than six months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under the lid of the container, and can detonate upon opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncsu.edu/ehs/www99/right/handsMan/lab/Peroxide.pdf |title=Danger: peroxidazable chemicals |last=Wray |first=Thomas K. |publisher=Environmental Health &amp; Public Safety, [[North Carolina State University]] |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729111002/https://www.ncsu.edu/ehs/www99/right/handsMan/lab/Peroxide.pdf |archivedate=2016-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the highly reactive nature of potassium metal, it must be handled with great care, with full skin and eye protection and preferably an explosion-resistant barrier between the user and the metal. Ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to [[hyperkalemia]], strongly influencing the cardiovascular system.&lt;ref name="hyper"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BfdighlyGiwC&amp;pg=PA903| chapter = Potassium Chloride and Potassium Permanganate|pages = 903–5|title = Medical toxicology|isbn = 978-0-7817-2845-4|last = Schonwald|first = Seth|date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=l8RkPU1-M5wC&amp;pg=PA223 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|page =223|title =Emergency medicine secrets|isbn =978-1-56053-503-4|last =Markovchick |first=Vincent J.|last2 =Pons |first2=Peter T.|last-author-amp =yes|date =2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potassium chloride is used in the [[United States]] for [[lethal injection]] executions.&lt;ref name="hyper"/&gt;

[[File:A48steam dome &amp; valve.jpg|thumb|The [[regulator (steam engine)|regulator]] is placed high in the [[steam dome|dome]] of a boiler, as the best location to avoid priming.]]
'''Priming''' ('''foaming''' in North America) is a condition in the [[boiler (power generation)|boiler]] of a [[steam locomotive]] in which water is carried over into the steam delivery. It may be caused by impurities in the water, which foams up as it boils, or simply too high a water level. It is harmful to the valves and pistons, as [[lubrication]] is washed away, and can be dangerous as any water collecting in the [[Cylinder (locomotive)|cylinders]] is not compressible and if trapped may fracture the cylinder head or [[piston]].

==Causes==
The most frequent cause is running the locomotive with too high a level of water in the boiler and is most apparent when the [[regulator (steam engine)|regulator]] is opened sharply or steam demand is high. Thus, sensible locomotive management by the operators will help to prevent the occurrence.  The phenomenon is particularly evident in areas of impure water, where boiled water creates a foam, or a mist of droplets, filling the space that collects steam at the top of the boiler, to be drawn down the steam collector pipe in the form of slugs of water.  If boiler water is [[Surface condenser|condensed]] and re-used, any oil or grease must be extracted as this form of contamination is particularly likely to give trouble.

==Remedy==
Early designers fitted curved sheets below the steam collector pipe, but these were not successful as the whole of the steam space could contain foam.  In districts where the  feed water is unsuitable, [[Boiler blowdown|blowdown valves]] ("scum valves"), either continuously working while the regulator is open or operated in conjunction with the boiler feed,  are fitted. Valves at water level reduce surface scum; those towards the bottom of the boiler help remove [[precipitated]] solids. Other forms of prevention include the chemical treatment of water before it enters the boiler. In the event of priming (and also when steam is admitted through cold piping or into a cold cylinder) the operators need to open the [[cylinder cocks]], which are designed to release trapped water. Once occurring, the problem can affect the level indicated in the boiler's [[Sight glass|gauge glass]] and for this reason is difficult to put right without reducing the water level to the extent that the [[Firebox (locomotive)|firebox]] crown becomes dangerously exposed.

Given sufficiently high uranium prices, it is feasible for reprocessed uranium to be re-[[enriched uranium|enriched]] and reused. A higher enrichment level is required to compensate for the &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U which is lighter than &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U and therefore concentrates in the enriched product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inl.gov/technicalpublications/Documents/3667084.pdf |title=Advanced Fuel Cycle Cost Basis |publisher=Idaho National Laboratory |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://swap.stanford.edu/20090124231050/http://www.inl.gov/technicalpublications/Documents/3667084.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, if [[Breeder_reactor#Fast_breeder_reactor|fast breeder reactors]] ever come into commercial use, reprocessed uranium, like [[depleted uranium]], will be usable in their breeding blankets.

There have been some studies involving the use of reprocessed uranium in [[CANDU]] reactors.  CANDU is designed to use natural uranium as fuel; the U-235 content remaining in spent PWR/BWR fuel is typically greater than that found in natural uranium, which is about 0.72% U-235, allowing the re-enrichment step to be skipped.  Fuel cycle tests also have included the DUPIC (Direct Use of spent PWR fuel In CANDU) fuel cycle, where used fuel from a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) is packaged into a CANDU fuel bundle with only physical reprocessing (cut into pieces) but no chemical reprocessing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/brat_fuel.htm |website=DUPIC| title=The Evolution of CANDU Fuel Cycles and Their Potential Contribution to World Peace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''road verge''' is a strip of grass or plants, and sometimes also [[tree]]s, located between a [[roadway]] (carriageway) and a [[sidewalk]] (pavement).&lt;ref name="worthington"/&gt; Verges are known by dozens of other names, often quite regional; see [[#Terminology|Terminology]], below.

The land is often [[public property]], with maintenance usually being a municipal responsibility. Some municipal authorities, however, require that abutting property owners maintain their respective verge areas, as well as the adjunct [[footpath]]s or [[sidewalk]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bicycle_pedestrian/publications/sidewalk2/sidewalks210.cfm |title=Designing Sidewalks and Trails for Access, Part II of II: Best Practices Design Guide, Section 10.1.3: Maintenance responsibilities| date = 25 September 2017 | work = Bicycle and Pedestrian Program |publisher=Federal Highways Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation | accessdate= 10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits include visual aesthetics, increased safety and comfort of sidewalk users, protection from spray from passing vehicles, and a space for benches, [[bus shelter]]s, street lights, and other public amenities. Verges are also often part of [[sustainability]] for [[water conservation]] or the management of [[urban runoff]] and [[water pollution]]&lt;ref name="rainwatercollecting"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rainwatercollecting.com/blog/?p=448 | title = Passive Rainwater Harvesting | accessdate = 7 July 2010 | date = 19 September 2009 | first = Jeremy | last = Delost | work = The Rainwater Observer | dead-url = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091223200107/http://www.rainwatercollecting.com/blog/?p=448 | archive-date = 23 December 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smgov"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Departments/OSE/Categories/Landscape/PLP%2005.27.09.pdf | format = PDF | title = Parkway Landscaping Policy for the City of Santa Monica | date = 1 February 2010 | publisher = City of [[Santa Monica, California]] |accessdate= 7 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612182146/http://smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Departments/OSE/Categories/Landscape/PLP%2005.27.09.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enewsbuilder"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.enewsbuilder.net/watercon/e_article000771115.cfm?x=bbrDcbK,b2FRwTrq,w |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722043546/http://www.enewsbuilder.net/watercon/e_article000771115.cfm?x=bbrDcbK,b2FRwTrq,w | archive-date = 22 July 2011 |title=Pruning the Parkway Strip | journal = WaterWise | volume = 4 | number = 3 | date = 14 March 2007 | publisher = Austin Water, City of Austin Water Conservation | location = [[Austin, Texas]] |accessdate= 7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can provide useful wildlife habitat. Snow that has been ploughed off the street in colder climates often is stored in the area of the verge by default.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

In the [[British Isles]], verges are the last location of habitats for a range of [[flora]].&lt;ref name=BBC-verges&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-33029385 | title = Roadside verges 'last refuge for wild flowers' | work = BBC News | publisher = [[BBC]] | last = Briggs | first = Helen | date = 6 June 2015 | accessdate = 6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Roadside Verge.jpg|thumb|Protection of roadside verge in Northumberland UK]]

The main disadvantage of a road verge is that the right-of-way must be wider, increasing the cost of the road. In some localities, a wider verge offers opportunity for later road widening, should the traffic usage of a road demand this. For this reason, footpaths are usually sited a significant distance from the curb.{{fact|date=March 2016}}


== Terminology ==
The term ''verge'' has many [[synonym]]s and [[dialect]]al differences. Some [[dialect]]s and [[idiolect]]s lack a specific term for this area, instead using a [[circumlocution]].&lt;ref name="tls"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/the-triumph-of-slang/ |title=The triumph of slang| first = John A.

==Sustainable urban and landscape design==
[[File:Treelawn2.JPG|thumb|300px|Planted [[rain garden]] in the "tree lawn" zone]]
In urban and suburban areas, [[urban runoff]] from private and civic properties can be guided by [[grading (engineering)|grading]] and [[bioswale]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]] collection and [[bioretention]] within the "tree-lawn" - parkway zone in [[rain garden]]s. This is done for reducing runoff of rain and domestic water: for their carrying waterborne pollution off-site into [[storm drain]]s and sewer systems; and for the [[groundwater recharge]] of [[aquifer]]s.&lt;ref name="rainwatercollecting"/&gt;

In some cities, such as [[Santa Monica, California]], city code mandates specify: &lt;blockquote&gt;Parkways, the area between the outside edge of the sidewalk and the inside edge of the curb which are a component of the Public Right of Way (PROW) - that the landscaping should require little or no irrigation and the area produce no runoff.&lt;ref name="smgov"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

For Santa Monica, another reason for this use of "tree-lawns" is to reduce current beach and [[Santa Monica Bay]] ocean pollution that is measurably higher at city outfalls. New construction and remodeling projects needing [[building permit]]s require that [[landscape design]] submittals include [[garden design]] plans showing the means of compliance.&lt;ref name="smgov"/&gt;

In some cities and counties, such as [[Portland, Oregon]], street and highway departments are regrading and planting [[rain garden]]s in road verges to reduce boulevard and highway runoff. This practice can be useful in areas with either independent [[Storm drain|Storm sewers]] or [[combined sewers|combined storm and sanitary sewers]], reducing the frequency of pollution, treatment costs, and released overflows of untreated sewage into rivers and oceans during rainstorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/BES/index.cfm?c=34598|title=Sustainable Stormwater Management|accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural roadsides==
In some countries, the road verge can be a corridor of vegetation that remains after adjacent land has been cleared.  Considerable effort in supporting conservation of the remnant vegetation is prevalent in Australia, where significant tracts of land are managed as part of the  ''roadside conservation'' strategies by government agencies.&lt;ref name="pandora.nla.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Western Australia.

The '''Robotic Refueling Mission''' (RRM) is a [[NASA]] technology demonstration mission with equipment launches in both 2011 and 2013 to increase the technological maturity of [[outer space|in-space]] [[rocket propellant]] [[propellant transfer|transfer]] technology by testing a wide variety of potential propellant transfer hardware, of both new and existing [[satellite]] designs.

The first phase of the mission was successfully completed in 2013.  The second phase experiments continued in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://phys.org/news/2015-07-nasa-robotic-onboard-space-station.html|title = NASA robotic servicing demonstrations continue onboard the space station|website = phys.org|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Development===
The Robotic Refueling Mission was developed by the Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC).&lt;ref name=nasa20110805&gt;
{{cite web |title=Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/RRM.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
It was planned to demonstrate the technology and tools to [[propellant transfer|refuel]] [[satellite]]s in orbit by robotic means.&lt;ref name=sn20100402&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/100402-nasa-plans-refuel-mock-satellite.html |title=NASA Plans To Refuel Mock Satellite at the Space Station |author=Debra Werner |publisher=Space News |date=2 April 2010 |accessdate=10 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the proof of concept, the long-term goal of NASA is to transfer the technology to the commercial sector.&lt;ref name=sn20100402/&gt;

RRM was designed with four tools, each with electronics and two cameras and lights. Additionally, it had pumps and controllers and electrical systems such as electrical valves and sensors.&lt;ref name=cheung2011&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.edcheung.com/job/iss/iss.html|title=Satellite Servicing Demonstration |author=Ed Cheung |publisher=edcheung.com |accessdate=10 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RRM payload was transported to the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in early March 2011, where the GSFC team performed the final preparations for space flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office Newsroom|url=https://ssco.gsfc.nasa.gov/newsroom.html|website=National Aeronautic and Space Administration|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Once up on the International Space Station, RRM was planned to be installed into the ELC-4.{{clarify|date=January 2013}} The [[Dextre]] robot was planned to be used in 2012 and 2013 during the refueling demonstration experiments.&lt;ref name=nasa20110816&gt;

===Launch===
The RRM phase 1 experiment platform was launched to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) on 8 July 2011, transported by [[Space Shuttle]] ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' on [[STS-135]], the 135th and final flight mission of the [[Federal Government of the United States|American]] Space Shuttle program.&lt;ref name=nasa20110805/&gt;&lt;ref name="approved"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/08/nasa-approve-sts-135-mission-june-28-2011-launch/ | title = NASA managers approve STS-135 mission planning for June&amp;nbsp;28, 2011 launch| accessdate= 20 August 2010| publisher= NASA Space flight |first=Chris|last=Bergin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= signed&gt;{{cite news|title= Obama signs Nasa up to new future| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11518049|newspaper=BBC|date=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology demonstration==

===Phase 1===
NASA successfully completed the phase 1 demonstration mission in January 2013, performing a series of [[robotic]] [[Liquid rocket propellants|refuelings]] of satellite hardware that had not been designed for refueling .  An extensive series of [[robotics|robotically-actuated]] [[propellant transfer]] experiments on the exposed facility platform of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) were completed by the RRM equipment suite and the [[Canadarm]]/[[Dextre]] robotic arm combination.&lt;ref name=sfn20130125&gt;
{{cite news |last=Clark|first=Stephen |title=Satellite refueling testbed completes demo in orbit |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1301/25rrm/#.UQQMpvJ5GIR |accessdate=2013-01-26 |newspaper=Spaceflight Now |date=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment suite included a number of [[rocket propellant|propellant]] [[valve]]s, [[nozzle]]s and [[Seal (mechanical)|seals]] similar to those used on a wide variety [[Communications satellite|commercial]] and [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] satellites, plus a series of four [[prototype]] [[Robot end effector|tools]] that could be attached to the [[distal]] end of the Dextre [[robotic arm]].  Each tool was a prototype of a device that could be used by future satellite servicing missions to refuel spacecraft in orbit.  RRM is the first in-space refueling demonstration using a platform of fuel valves and spacecraft plumbing representative of most existing satellites, which were not designed for refueling.&lt;ref name=sfn20130125/&gt;

===Phase 2===
Phase 2 of the RRM mission began in August 2013 with the launch of the phase 2 RRM hardware to the ISS aboard the Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]] 4 ([[HTV-4]]) for test operations expected to be carried out in 2014.&lt;ref name=pa20130804&gt;
{{cite news |last=Messier|first=Doug |title=Robotic Refueling Mission Gears Up for Phase 2 |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2013/08/04/robotic-refueling-mission-gears-up-for-phase-2/ |accessdate=2013-08-05 |newspaper=Parabolic Arc |date=2013-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phase 2 hardware complement consists of:&lt;ref name=pa20130804/&gt;
*Two additional RRM task boards
*The RRM On-orbit Transfer Cage
*The [[Visual Inspection Poseable Invertebrate Robot]] (VIPIR)—a "borescope inspection tool that provides a set of eyes for internal satellite repair jobs."

In February 2014 the ground-based 'Remote Robotic Oxidizer Transfer Test' (RROxiTT) transferred [[nitrogen tetroxide]] (NTO) via a standard satellite-fueling valve at the satellite fuelling facility, [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC), using a robot [[teleoperation|controlled remotely]] from the [[Goddard Space Flight Centre]], {{convert|800|mi}} away in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=av-wk-transfer&gt;{{cite web |author=Morring, Frank, Jr. |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/awx_02_28_2014_p0-667874.xml |title=NASA Robotically Transfers Satellite Oxidizer |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 26, 2015 The RRM On-orbit Transfer Cage was loaded into the Kibo airlock and picked up by the JEM Robotic Arm who handed it off to Dextre for installation on the main module. 

On April 30, 2015 The RRM On-Orbit Transfer Cage was installed on the main module and the Phase 1 hardware was removed and placed in the cage for disposal on HTV-4. The experiment was then activated that same day.

February 2016 the Phase 2 experiment was deactivated and all fuel and cooling lines were turned off in preparation for disposal of the RRM payload and its fuel on SpaceX Dragon CRS-10.

On February 23, 2017 The main module of the RRM experiment and the Phase 2 hardware were removed and stored in the trunk of [[SpaceX CRS-10]] for disposal and the STP H5 experiment with Raven was activated beginning Phase 3.

=== Phase 3 ===
With the completion of Phase 2 Phase 3 testing is underway with the launch of Raven on CRS-10. The new Phase 3 module will be delivered to the station in December 2018 on [[SpaceX CRS-16]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8669">A '''rotating detonation engine''' ('''RDE''') is a proposed engine using a form of pressure gain combustion, where one or more detonations continuously travel around an annular channel. Although none are in production, computational simulations and experimental results have shown that the RDE has potential,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lu |first=Frank |last2=Braun |first2=Eric |date=7 July 2014 |title=Rotating Detonation Wave Propulsion: Experimental Challenges, Modeling, and Engine Concepts |url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.B34802 |journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power |publisher=The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=1125–1142 |doi=10.2514/1.B34802}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is wide interest and research into the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolanski|first1=Piotr|title=Detonative Propulsion|journal=Proceedings of the Combustion Institute|date=2013|volume=34|issue=1|pages=125-158|doi=10.1016/j.proci.2012.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, detonative combustion, (i.e. that which happens at speeds above the speeds of sound), is more efficient than the conventional [[Deflagration|deflagrative combustion]] by as much as 25%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rg.ru/2018/01/18/levochkin-vozmozhnost-sozdaniia-detonacionnogo-dvigatelia-podtverdilas.html|title=В России испытали модель детонационного двигателя для ракет будущего|date=2018-01-18|work=Российская газета|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If this theoretical gain in efficiency can be realized, there would be a major fuel savings benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cao|first1=Huan|last2=Wilson|first2=Donald|title=Parametric Cycle Analysis of Continuous Rotating Detonation Ejector-Augmented Rocket Engine|journal=49th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference|date=14–17 July 2013|page=AIAA 2013-3971|doi=10.2514/6.2013-3971|url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2013-3971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwer |first=Douglas |last2=Kailasanath |first2=Kailas |date=25 September 2010 |title=Numerical Investigation of the Physics of Rotating Detonation Engines |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1540748910003159 |journal=Proceedings of the Combustion Institute |publisher=Elsevier, Inc. |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=2195–2202 |doi=10.1016/j.proci.2010.07.050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the combustion is supersonic, it can also more efficiently provide thrust at speeds above the speed of sound. 

The disadvantages of the RDE include stability and noise.

== How it works ==
The basic concept of an RDE is a detonation wave that travels around an annulus, which is a circular channel. First, fuel and oxidizer are injected into the channel, normally through small holes or slits. Initially, a detonation must be initiated in the fuel/oxidizer mixture by use of some form of ignitor. After the engine is started, however, the detonation is self-sustaining. The passing detonation ignites the fuel/oxidizer mixture, which releases the energy necessary to sustain the detonation. The combustion products expand out of the channel and are also pushed out of the channel by the incoming fuel and oxidizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolanski|first1=Piotr|title=Detonative Propulsion|journal=Proceedings of the Combustion Institute|date=2013|volume=34|issue=1|pages=125-158|doi=10.1016/j.proci.2012.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the RDE's design is similar to the [[Pulse detonation engine|pulse detonation engine (PDE)]], one aspect that makes the RDE superior is the fact that the waves constantly cycle around the chamber, while the PDE requires the chambers to be purged after each pulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pressure Gain Combustion Program Committee - Resources |url = https://info.aiaa.org/tac/pc/PGCPC/Resources/Resources.aspx |website = AIAA Pressure Gain Combustion Program Committee |accessdate = 2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An image of an RDE can be found on the [https://info.aiaa.org/tac/pc/PGCPC/Resources/Resources.aspx American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Pressure Gain Combustion Program Committee's Resources page].

== Current development ==
Several organisations have been working on RDE design. 

=== US Navy===
The [[US Navy]] is pushing the development of this engine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How the Rotating Detonation Engine Works|url = http://auto.howstuffworks.com/under-the-hood/trends-innovations/rotating-detonation-engine3.htm|website = HowStuffWorks|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no known time of completion. Researchers at the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)]] have been showing particular interest in detonation engines, such as the RDE, because they realize these engines have the capability to reduce the fuel consumption in their heavy vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = US Navy developing rotating detonation engine|url = http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/news/news-picks/usnvydevelopingrottingdetontionengine-a-news-pick-post|journal = Physics Today|date = 2012-11-06|issn = 0031-9228|doi=10.1063/PT.5.026505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How the Rotating Detonation Engine Works|url = http://auto.howstuffworks.com/under-the-hood/trends-innovations/rotating-detonation-engine2.htm|website = HowStuffWorks|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several obstacles still remain to overcome in order to use the RDE in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Navy Researchers Look to Rotating Detonation Engines to Power the Future - U.S. Naval Research Laboratory|url = http://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2012/Navy-Researchers-Look-to-Rotating-Detonation-Engines-to-Power-the-Future|website = www.nrl.navy.mil|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; NRL researchers are currently focusing on getting a better understanding of how the RDE works.

=== Aerojet Rocketdyne ===
Since 2010, [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]] has conducted over 520 tests of multiple configurations of a rotating detonation engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claflin|first1=Scott|title=Recent Advances in Power Cycles Using Rotating Detonation Engines with Subcritical and Supercritical CO2|url=http://www.swri.org/4org/d18/sCO2/papers2014/systemConcepts/09PPT-Claflin.pdf|website=Southwest Research Institute|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA ===
Researchers at [[NASA]] also play a part in the development of the RDE. [http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/cdtb/personnel/dan.html Daniel Paxson], an accredited scientist at the [[Glenn Research Center]], has used simulations in [[Computational fluid dynamics|computational fluid dynamics (CFD)]] to assess the RDE's detonation frame of reference and compares the performance with the PDE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UCSB Full Bib - External Link|url = http://pegasus.library.ucsb.edu/F/MBE5776HMPFJMQ45D8TAUSM6V9237AU4DVN1D521M49XLCE8CG-35036?func=service&amp;doc_library=SBA01&amp;doc_number=004533761&amp;line_number=0001&amp;func_code=WEB-FULL&amp;service_type=MEDIA|website = pegasus.library.ucsb.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the results from his code of the RDE were shown to be in favor of those from a more complex code; thus, stating that the RDE can perform at least on the same level. Furthermore, he found that the performance of the RDE can be directly compared to the PDE as their performance were essentially the same.

=== Energomash ===
According to the Russian Vice Prime Minister [[Dmitry Rogozin]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/dmitry.rogozin/posts/1651863201503679?pnref=story Facebook post], in Russian&lt;/ref&gt; in mid-January 2018 [[NPO Energomash]] company successfully completed the initial test phase of the 2-ton class [[liquid-propellant rocket|liquid propelant]] RDE and plans to develop larger ones for use in the space launch vehicles. 

===Other research===
Other experiments have used numerical procedures to better understand the flow-field of the RDE.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Numerical investigation of the physics of rotating-detonation-engines|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1540748910003159|journal = Proceedings of the Combustion Institute|date = 2011-01-01|pages = 2195–2202|volume = 33|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.proci.2010.07.050|first = Douglas|last = Schwer|first2 = Kailas|last2 = Kailasanath}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Sodium diuranate'''  or '''yellow uranium oxide''', Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is a [[uranium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] also known as the yellow oxide of uranium. Sodium diuranate is commonly referred to by the initials SDU.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, A. D.(2013). Modified Sodium Diuranate Process For the Recovery of Uranium From Uranium Hexafluoride Transport Cylinder Wash Solution. (Doctoral dissertation). Retrieved from http://scholarcommons.sc.edu/etd/2466&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[ammonium diuranate]] it was a component in early [[yellowcake]]s.&lt;ref name="Kent2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=James A.

The final uranium composition was from 0.008 to 0.1% by weight uranium with an average of about 0.02%. The practice appears to have stopped in the late 1980s.

In the classical procedure for extracting uranium, [[pitchblende]] is broken up and mixed with [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mqes-uranium.com/metallurgy.html |title=MQes Uranium Inc. |language=English |accessdate=2016-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The uranium dissolves to form [[uranyl sulfate]], and [[sodium hydroxide]] is added to make the uranium [[precipitate]] as sodium diuranate. This older method of extracting uranium from its [[uraninite|uraninite ores]] has been replaced in current practice by such procedures as [[solvent extraction]], [[ion exchange]], and [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] methods.

In the past it was widely used to produce [[uranium glass]] or vaseline glass, the [[sodium]] salt dissolving easily into the [[silica]] matrix during the firing of the initial melt.

The [[alkaline]] process of milling uranium ores involves precipitating sodium uranate from the pregnant [[In-situ leaching|leaching]] solution to produce the semi-refined product referred to as [[yellowcake]].

Sodium uranate may be obtained in the amorphous form by heating together urano-uranic oxide and sodium chlorate; or by heating sodium uranyl acetate or carbonate. The crystalline form is produced by adding the green oxide in small quantities to fused sodium chloride, or by dissolving the amorphous form in fused sodium chloride, and allowing crystallization to take place. It yields reddish-yellow to greenish-yellow prisms or leaflets.

'''Solar road studs''' are flashing [[solar cell]] powered [[LED]] maintenance-free lighting devices used in road construction to delineate road edges and centrelines. Embedded in the road surface, they are an electronic improvement on the traditional [[Cat's eye (road)|cat's eyes]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/11845616/End-of-the-road-for-cats-eyes.html&lt;/ref&gt; in that they may give drivers more than a thirty-second reaction window compared with about 3 seconds for conventional reflective devices. The intense brightness of the LEDs makes them easily visible at distances of about 900 m under favourable conditions.

Averaging about 100 mm square or 100 mm diameter and about 40 mm thick, units are extremely robust to avoid damage by passing vehicles, and are normally constructed of [[engineering plastic]]s and [[polycarbonates]]. Use of solar road studs reduces the necessity of headlight main beams and the accompanying hazard of dazzling oncoming drivers. They are also more visible in rain and fog conditions where the old type [[retroreflectors]] and road markings are problematic. The solar cells charge batteries or capacitors during sunlit hours, over which period the flashing LEDs are turned off by a [[photoswitch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/astucia-solar-powered-road-studs/8382/ Gizmag]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Somali Airlines Flight 40''' was a scheduled domestic [[Somali Airlines]] flight on 20 July 1981 from [[Mogadishu]] to [[Hargeisa]] in Somalia. The aircraft crashed a few minutes after takeoff, and all 44 passengers and six crew on board were killed.

==Flight==
On 20 July 1981, Somali Airlines Flight 40, operated by a [[Fokker F27 Friendship]], took off from Mogadishu's [[Mogadishu International Airport]] en route to [[Hargeisa International Airport]] in Hargeisa. It later returned to the Mogadishu airport for some repairs, before departing a second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wbxbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mVINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4460,4139492&amp;dq=somali+airlines+crash&amp;hl=en|title=49 are killed in Somali crash|newspaper=[[St. Joseph News-Press]]|date=20 July 1981|page=3A}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few minutes after Flight 40 took off again, the aircraft entered an area of heavy rainfall. The flight crew   subsequently lost control and crashed near the town of [[Balad, Somalia|Balad]]. All 50 people on board were killed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19810720-0 Aircraft accident Fokker F-27 Friendship 600RF 6O-SAY Balad Plane crash claims 49 in Somalia]&lt;/ref&gt; the most fatalities in a single aircraft crash within Somali airspace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?Country=6O ASN Aviation Safety Database Somalia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The crash investigation determined that the aircraft had entered a spiral dive after encountering strong vertical gusts. Loads during the dive increased to approximately 5.76 [[g-force|g]], exceeding the design stress limits of the [[Fokker F27]] type and causing its right wing to separate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19810720-0 Aircraft accident Fokker F-27 Friendship 600RF 6O-SAY Balad]&lt;/ref&gt; The flight crew were believed to have erred in taking off during known thunderstorm conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=07201981&amp;reg=6O-SAY&amp;airline=Somali+Airlines Somali Airlines Flight 40 at Airdisaster.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Station Stones''' are elements of the prehistoric monument of [[Stonehenge]].

Originally there were four stones, resembling the four corners of a rectangle that straddles the inner [[sarsen]] circle, set just inside Stonehenge's surrounding bank. Two stood on earth mounds at opposing corners, one corner broadly in the north of the site and one in the south. The mounds are called the North and South [[tumulus|barrow]]s although they never contained burials. The [[ring ditch]]es surrounding these barrows respect the presence of Stonehenge's encircling bank indicating that they postdate this feature. 

The other two corners of the rectangle are occupied by the two surviving stones which are undressed sarsens. Their installation at the monument dates to sometime in [[Stonehenge#Stonehenge3i|Stonehenge phase 3]], perhaps around 4,000 years ago. 

Various astronomical alignments have been suggested for the stones, all involving other features at the site. As they cannot be said with certainty to have been contemporaneous with other stones or posts at Stonehenge, [[archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomical]] theories regarding their function have been treated with scepticism by mainstream [[archaeology]]. Although described as forming a rectangle, the two stones and the two stone settings can also be described as representing two opposite facets of an octagon. This suggests that they were laid out to a geometric plan and challenges the theory that the positions were astronomically determined.

'''Supercritical carbon dioxide''' ('''s{{chem|CO|2}}''') is a fluid state of [[carbon dioxide]] where it is held at or above its [[critical temperature]] and [[critical pressure]].

Carbon dioxide usually behaves as a [[gas]] in [[air]] at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] (STP), or as a [[solid]] called [[dry ice]] when frozen. If the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] are both increased from STP to be at or above the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] for carbon dioxide, it can adopt properties midway between a gas and a [[liquid]]. More specifically, it behaves as a [[supercritical fluid]] above its critical temperature ({{convert|304.25|K|C F|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) and critical pressure ({{convert|72.9|atm|MPa psi bar|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), expanding to fill its container like a gas but with a [[density]] like that of a liquid.

Supercritical {{chem|CO|2}} is becoming an important commercial and industrial [[solvent]] due to its role in chemical [[extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] in addition to its low toxicity and environmental impact. The relatively low temperature of the process and the stability of {{chem|CO|2}} also allows most compounds to be extracted with little damage or [[Denaturation_(biochemistry)|denaturing]]. In addition, the solubility of many extracted compounds in {{chem|CO|2}} varies with pressure,&lt;ref&gt;Discovery - Can Chemistry Save The World? - BBC World Service&lt;/ref&gt; permitting selective extractions.

==Applications==

===Solvent===
{{Main|Supercritical fluid extraction}}
Carbon dioxide is gaining popularity among [[coffee]] manufacturers looking to move away from classic decaffeinating [[solvent]]s, because of real or perceived dangers related to their use in food preparation. s{{chem|CO|2}} is forced through the green coffee beans which are then sprayed with water at high pressure to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated for resale (e.g. to the pharmaceutical or beverage manufacturers) by passing the water through [[activated carbon|activated charcoal filters]] or by [[distillation]], [[crystallization]] or [[reverse osmosis]]. Supercritical carbon dioxide is used to remove [[organochloride]] pesticides and metals from agricultural crops without adulterating the desired constituents from the plant matter in the herbal supplement industry.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercritical carbon dioxide can be used as a more environmentally friendly solvent for [[dry cleaning]] over traditional solvents such as hydrocarbons, including [[perchloroethylene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Gina|last=Stewart |title=Dry Cleaning with Liquid Carbon Dioxide|journal=Green chemistry using liquid and s{{chem|CO|2}} |editors=Joseph M. DeSimone and William Tumas |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=United States |pages=215–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercritical carbon dioxide is used as the extraction solvent for creation of [[essential oils]] and other [[herbal distillates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aizpurua-Olaizola|first=Oier|last2=Ormazabal|first2=Markel|last3=Vallejo|first3=Asier|last4=Olivares|first4=Maitane|last5=Navarro|first5=Patricia|last6=Etxebarria|first6=Nestor|last7=Usobiaga|first7=Aresatz|date=2015-01-01|title=Optimization of supercritical fluid consecutive extractions of fatty acids and polyphenols from Vitis vinifera grape wastes|journal=Journal of Food Science|volume=80|issue=1|pages=E101–107|doi=10.1111/1750-3841.12715|issn=1750-3841|pmid=25471637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main advantages over solvents such as [[hexane]] and [[acetone]] in this process are that it is non-toxic and non-flammable. Furthermore, separation of the reaction components from the starting material is much simpler than with traditional [[organic solvents]]. The {{chem|CO|2}} can evaporate into the air or be recycled by condensation into a cold recovery vessel. Its advantage over [[steam distillation]] is that it operates at a lower temperature, which can separate the plant [[waxes]] from the oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Mendiola | first1 =J.A. | last2 =Herrero | first2 =M. | last3 =Cifuentes | first3 =A. | last4 =Ibañez | first4 =E. | year =2007 | title =Use of compressed fluids for sample preparation: Food applications | url =| journal =Journal of Chromatography A | volume =1152 | issue =1-2| pages =234–246 | doi =10.1016/j.chroma.2007.02.046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[laboratory|laboratories]], s{{chem|CO|2}} is used as an extraction solvent, for example for determining total recoverable hydrocarbons from soils, sediments, fly-ash and other media,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081217144727/http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/testmethods/index.htm U.S.EPA Method 3560 Supercritical Fluid Extraction of Total Recoverable Hydrocarbons]&lt;/ref&gt; and determination of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] in soil and solid wastes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/SW-846/pdfs/3561.pdf U.S.EPA Method 3561 Supercritical Fluid Extraction of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons].&lt;/ref&gt; Supercritical fluid extraction has been used in determining [[hydrocarbon]] components in water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:796602/FULLTEXT01.pdf Use of Ozone Depleting Substances in Laboratories]. TemaNord 2003:516.&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes that use s{{chem|CO|2}} to produce micro and [[Nano-|nano]] scale particles, often for [[pharmaceutical]] uses, are under development. The gas [[antisolvent]] process, rapid expansion of supercritical solutions and supercritical antisolvent [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] (as well as several related methods) process a variety of substances into particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Yeo | first1 =S. | last2 =Kiran | first2 =E. | year =2005 | title =Formation of polymer particles with supercritical fluids: A review | doi =10.1016/j.supflu.2004.10.006 | journal =J. Supercrit. Fluids | volume =34 | issue =| pages =287–308 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its ability to selectively dissolve organic compounds and assist the functioning of enzymes, s{{chem|CO|2}} has been suggested as a potential solvent to support biological activity on [[Venus]]- or [[super-Earth]]-type planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Budisa|first1=Nediljko|last2=Schulze-Makuch|first2=Dirk|title=Supercritical Carbon Dioxide and Its Potential as a Life-Sustaining Solvent in a Planetary Environment|journal=Life|date=8 August 2014|volume=4|issue=3|pages=331–340|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/4/3/331|doi=10.3390/life4030331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufactured products===
Environmentally beneficial, low-cost substitutes for rigid [[thermoplastic]] and fired [[ceramic]] are made using s{{chem|CO|2}} as a [[chemical reagent]]. The s{{chem|CO|2}} in these processes is reacted with the alkaline components of fully hardened [[hydraulic cement]] or [[gypsum]] [[plaster]] to form various carbonates.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=James B.|last=Rubin |first2=Craig M. V. |last2=Taylor |first3=Thomas |last3=Hartmann |first4=Patricia |last4=Paviet-Hartmann |title=Enhancing the Properties of Portland Cements Using Supercritical Carbon Dioxide|journal=Green chemistry using liquid and supercritical carbon dioxide |editors=Joseph M. DeSimone and William Tumas |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |pages=241–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary byproduct is water.

Supercritical carbon dioxide is used in the foaming of [[polymers]]. Supercritical carbon dioxide can saturate the polymer with solvent. Upon depressurization and heating the carbon dioxide rapidly expands, causing voids within the polymer matrix, i.e., creating a foam. Research is also ongoing at many universities in the production of microcellular foams using s{{chem|CO|2}}.

An [[electrosynthesis|electrochemical]] [[carboxylation]] of a para-[[isobutyl]][[benzyl chloride]] to [[ibuprofen]] is promoted under s{{chem|CO|2}}.&lt;ref name=SCY&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Sakakura | first1 =Toshiyasu | author1-link =Toshiyasu Sakakura | last2 =Choi | first2 =Jun-Chul | author2-link =Jun-Chul Choi | last3 =Yasuda | first3 =Hiroyuki | author3-link =Hiroyuki Yasuda | title =Transformation of Carbon dioxide | journal =Chemical Reviews | volume =107 | issue =6 | pages =2365–2387 | publisher =American Chemical Society | location =| date =13 June 2007 | url =http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr068357u | issn =

===Working fluid===
Supercritical {{chem|CO|2}} is chemically stable, reliable, low-cost, non-toxic, non-flammable and readily available, making it a desirable candidate working fluid.

====Power generation ====
The unique properties of s{{chem|CO|2}} present advantages for closed-loop power generation and can be applied to various power generation applications. Power generation systems that use traditional air [[Brayton cycle|Brayton]] and steam [[Rankine cycle]]s can be upgraded to s{{chem|CO|2}} to increase efficiency and power output.

The relatively new [[Allam power cycle]] uses sCO2 as the working fluid in combination with fuel and pure oxygen. The CO2 produced by combustion mixes with the sCO2 working fluid and a corresponding amount of pure CO2 must be removed from the process (for industrial use or sequestration). This process reduces atmospheric emissions to zero. 

It presents interesting properties that promise substantial improvements in system efficiency. Due to its high fluid density, s{{chem|CO|2}} enables extremely compact and highly efficient turbomachinery. It can use simpler, single casing body designs while [[steam turbine]]s require multiple turbine stages and associated casings, as well as additional inlet and outlet piping. The high density allows for highly compact, microchannel-based heat exchanger technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.echogen.com/documents/why-sco2-can-displace-steam.pdf|title =Supercritical CO2 Power Cycle Developments and Commercialization: Why sCO2 can Displace Steam|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, General Electric announced an s{{chem|CO|2}}-based turbine that operated at 50% efficiency. In it the {{chem|CO|2}} is heated to 700&amp;nbsp;°C. It requires less compression and allows heat transfer. It reaches full power in 2 minutes, whereas steam turbines need at least 30 minutes. The prototype generated 10&amp;nbsp;MW and is approximately 10% the size of a comparable steam turbine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601218/desk-size-turbine-could-power-a-town/#/set/id/601246/|title=Desk-Size Turbine Could Power a Town|last=Talbot|first=David|date=April 11, 2016|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, due to its superior thermal stability and non-flammability, direct heat exchange from high temperature sources is possible, permitting higher working fluid temperatures and therefore higher cycle efficiency. And unlike two-phase flow, s{{chem|CO|2}}’s single-phase nature eliminates the necessity of a heat input for phase change that is required for the water to steam conversion, thereby also eliminating associated [[Fatigue (material)|thermal fatigue]] and corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://breakingenergy.com/2014/11/24/supercritical-carbon-dioxide-power-cycles-starting-to-hit-the-market/|title =Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Power Cycles Starting to Hit the Market|date =|accessdate =|website =Breaking Energy|publisher =|last =|first =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the promise of substantially higher efficiency and lower capital costs, the use of s{{chem|CO|2}} presents material selection and design issues. Materials in power generation components must display resistance to damage caused by [[Thermal resistance|high-temperature]], [[Anti-corrosion|oxidation]] and [[Creep (deformation)#Preventing creep|creep]]. Candidate materials that meet these property and performance goals include incumbent alloys in power generation, such as nickel-based superalloys for turbomachinery components and [[austenitic stainless steel]]s for piping. Components within s{{chem|CO|2}} Brayton loops suffer from corrosion and erosion, specifically erosion in turbomachinery and recuperative heat exchanger components and intergranular corrosion and pitting in the piping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://energy.sandia.gov/wp-content/gallery/uploads/SAND-2014-0602C.pdf|title =Corrosion and Erosion Behavior in s{{chem|CO|2}} Power Cycles|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =Sandia National Laboratories|last =|first =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing has been conducted on candidate Ni-based alloys, austenitic steels, ferritic steels and ceramics for corrosion resistance in s{{chem|CO|2}} cycles. The interest in these materials derive from their formation of protective surface oxide layers in the presence of carbon dioxide, however in most cases further evaluation of the reaction mechanics and corrosion/erosion kinetics and mechanisms is required, as none of the materials meet the necessary goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.swri.org/4org/d18/sCO2/papers2014/materials/61-Pint.pdf|title =THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE sCO2 COMPATIBILITY OF CONVENTIONAL STRUCTURAL ALLOYS|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =The 4th International Symposium - Supercritical CO2 Power Cycles|last =|first =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/e721cac4-dfdd-4490-985c-f519efec6426/etd_pdf/123e849e0ffc3b9bc8249b63b32d1738/parks-corrosionofcandidatehightemperaturealloys.pdf|title =Corrosion of Candidate High Temperature Alloys in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =Ottawa-Carleton Institute for Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering|last =J.

====Other ====
Work is underway to develop a s{{chem|CO|2}} [[closed-cycle gas turbine]] to operate at temperatures near 550&amp;nbsp;°C. This would have implications for bulk thermal and nuclear generation of electricity, because the supercritical properties of carbon dioxide at above 500&amp;nbsp;°C and 20&amp;nbsp;MPa enable thermal efficiencies approaching 45&amp;nbsp;percent. This could increase the electrical power produced per unit of fuel required by 40&amp;nbsp;percent or more. Given the volume of carbon fuels used in producing electricity, the environmental impact of cycle efficiency increases would be significant.&lt;ref&gt;V. Dostal, M.J. Driscoll, P. Hejzlar, {{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/jessiek/MacData/afs.course.lockers/22/22.33/www/dostal.pdf |title=A Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Cycle for Next Generation Nuclear Reactors |accessdate=2007-11-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227172513/http://web.mit.edu/jessiek/MacData/afs.course.lockers/22/22.33/www/dostal.pdf |archivedate=December 27, 2010 |df= }} ''MIT-ANP-Series'', MIT-ANP-TR-100 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercritical {{chem|CO|2}} is an emerging natural refrigerant, used in new, low carbon solutions for domestic [[heat pump]]s. Supercritical {{chem|CO|2}} heat pumps are commercially marketed in Asia. [[EcoCute]] systems from Japan, developed by Mayekawa, develop high temperature domestic water with small inputs of electric power by moving heat into the system from the surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heat Pumps|url=http://www.mayekawa.com/products/heat_pumps/|website=Mayekawa Manufacturing Company (Mycom)|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercritical {{chem|CO|2}} has been used since the 1980s to enhance recovery in mature oil fields.

"[[Clean coal]]" technologies are emerging that could combine such enhanced recovery methods with [[carbon sequestration]]. Using [[gasifier]]s instead of conventional furnaces, coal and water is reduced to hydrogen gas, carbon dioxide and ash. This hydrogen gas can be used to produce electrical power In [[combined cycle]] gas turbines, {{chem|CO|2}} is captured, compressed to the supercritical state and injected into geological storage, possibly into existing oil fields to improve yields. The unique properties of s{{chem|CO|2}} ensure that it remains out of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10922&amp;page=84 "The Hydrogen Economy: Opportunities, Costs, Barriers, and R&amp;D Needs"], p. 84 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FutureGen 2.0 Project |url=http://futuregenalliance.org/futuregen-2-0-project/ |website=FutureGen Alliance |accessdate=7 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210090013/http://futuregenalliance.org/futuregen-2-0-project/ |archivedate=10 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zero.no/transport/bio/fischer-tropsch-reactor-fed-by-syngas Øyvind Vessia: "Fischer- Tropsch reactor fed by syngas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929003817/http://www.zero.no/transport/bio/fischer-tropsch-reactor-fed-by-syngas |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercritical {{chem|CO|2}} could be used as a working fluid in [[Enhanced Geothermal Systems|enhanced geothermal systems]]. Possible advantages compared to water include higher energy yield resulting from its lower viscosity, better chemical interaction, {{chem|CO|2}} storage through fluid loss and higher temperature limit. As of 2011, the concept had not been tested in the field.&lt;ref&gt;K Pruess(2006), [http://www.geothermal-energy.org/pdf/IGAstandard/SGW/2000/Brown.pdf "A hot dry rock geothermal energy concept utilizing s{{chem|CO|2}} instead of water"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald W.

===Aerogel production===
Supercritical carbon dioxide is used in the production of silica, carbon and metal based [[aerogels]]. For example, silicon dioxide gel is formed and then exposed to s{{chem|CO|2}}. When the {{chem|CO|2}} goes supercritical, all surface tension is removed, allowing the liquid to leave the aerogel and produce nanometer sized pores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerogel.org/?p=345|title=Aerogel.org » Supercritical Drying|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sterilization of biomedical materials===
Supercritical {{chem|CO|2}} is an alternative for terminal sterilization of biological materials and medical devices with combination of the additive [[peracetic acid]] (PAA). Supercritical {{chem|CO|2}} does not sterilize the media, because it does not kill the spores of microorganisms. Moreover, this process is gentle, as the morphology, ultrastructure and protein profiles of inactivated microbes are preserved.&lt;ref&gt;A.White, D. Burns, T.W. Christensen, [http://www.novasterilis.com/technology/images/PDFS/BIOTEC_4178.pdf "Effective terminal sterilization using supercritical carbon dioxide"]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, ''Journal of Biotechnology''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleaning===
Supercritical {{chem|CO|2}} is used in certain industrial [[carbon dioxide cleaning|cleaning processes]].
