The '''Wayne County Airport runway collision''' involved the collision of two [[Northwest Airlines]] planes in dense fog at [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] on December 3, 1990. It occurred when '''Flight 1482''', a scheduled [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|Douglas DC-9-14]] operating from Detroit to [[Pittsburgh International Airport]], taxied onto an active runway by mistake in dense fog and was hit by a departing [[Boeing 727]] operating as '''Flight 299''' to [[Memphis International Airport]]. One crew and seven occupants of the DC-9 were killed.&lt;ref name="AAR-91-05 Final Report"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Levin NYT 12.04.90"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/04/us/collision-in-detroit-at-least-8-die-in-collision-on-detroit-airport-runway.html |title=COLLISION IN DETROIT; At Least 8 Die in Collision On Detroit Airport Runway |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=B16 |last=Levin |first=Doron P. |date=December 4, 1990 |accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==
Northwest 1482 was cleared from the gate towards Runway 03C, but it missed turning onto taxiway Oscar 6 and instead entered the Outer taxiway. To correct the error they were instructed to turn right onto Taxiway Xray but they turned onto the active runway 03C. They realised the mistake and contacted air traffic for instructions who told them to leave the runway immediately, five seconds later (at 13:45 EST) the crew saw a Boeing 727 heading towards them. The Boeing 727 was operating the Northwest 299 flight to Memphis and had just been cleared for take-off. The 727 wing hit the right-hand side of the DC-9 and cut through the fuselage just below the windows until it cut off the DC-9's #2 engine. The DC-9 caught fire and was destroyed; the 727 just had a damaged wing and was later repaired.&lt;ref name="asn1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19901203-1 |publisher=Aviation Safety Net |title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas DC-9-14 N3313L Detroit-Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, MI (DTW) |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asn2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19901203-2 |publisher=Aviation Safety Net |title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 727–251 N278US Detroit-Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, MI (DTW) |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The captain escaped from the aircraft through the left sliding window. 18 people escaped from the aircraft from the left overwing exit. 13 persons got out through the left main boarding door. 4 people jumped from the right service door. The rear jumpseat flight attendant and a passenger died from smoke inhalation in the DC-9's tailcone; the tailcone release was not activated, and later investigation determined that the tailcone release mechanism was mechanically inoperable.&lt;ref name="AAR-91-05 Final Report"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

Of the surviving passengers, the NTSB stated that 10 received serious injuries and 23 received minor or no injuries. The three surviving crew members received minor or no injuries. The NTSB added that it did not receive medical records for three passengers who were admitted to a burn center; for the purposes of the report, the NTSB labeled their injuries as serious. The NTSB did not receive medical records for the copilot and 6 passengers who were treated and released from area hospitals; for the purposes of the report the NTSB assumed that they received minor injuries.&lt;ref name="AAR-91-05 Final Report"/&gt;{{rp|11}}

==Aircraft==
The Douglas DC-9 operating Flight 1482 was [[Aircraft registration|registered]] N3313L built in 1966 and had a total of 62,253 operating hours. The DC-9 was delivered new to Delta before being sold to Northwest predecessor Southern Airways in 1973.&lt;ref name="AAR-91-05 Final Report"/&gt;{{rp|87}} The Boeing 727 operating Flight 299 was registered N278US and had been purchased by Northwest in 1975 with a total of 37,310 operating hours. The aircraft was repaired and flew for Northwest until 1995. N278US was flown by Kitty Hawk Aircargo before being scrapped in 2011.&lt;ref name="AAR-91-05 Final Report"/&gt;{{rp|87}}

==Investigation==
The accident was investigated by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]], which determined the probable cause of the accident to be:&lt;ref name="AAR-91-05 Final Report"/&gt;{{rp|79}}

{{quote|a lack of proper crew coordination, including a virtual reversal of roles by the DC-9 pilots, which led to their failure to stop taxiing their airplane and alert the ground controller of their positional uncertainty in a timely manner before and after intruding onto the active runway.

Contributing to the cause of the accident were (1) deficiencies in the air traffic control services provided by the Detroit tower, including failure of the ground controller to take timely action to alert the local controller to the possible runway incursion, inadequate visibility observations, failure to use progressive taxi instructions in low-visibility conditions, and issuance of inappropriate and confusing taxi instructions compounded by inadequate backup supervision for the level of experience of the staff on duty; (2) deficiencies in the surface markings, signage, and lighting at the airport and the failure of Federal Aviation Administration surveillance to detect or correct any of these deficiencies; and (3) failure of Northwest Airlines, Inc., to provide adequate cockpit resource management training to their line aircrews.

Contributing to the fatalities in the accident was the inoperability of the DC-9 internal tail cone release mechanism. Contributing to the number and severity of injuries was the failure of the crew of the DC-9 to properly execute the passenger evacuation.}}

The '''Argonne–Northwestern Solar Energy Research Center''' ('''ANSER Center''') is a joint research program between the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] and [[Northwestern University]]. [[Michael R. Wasielewski]], Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern founded the ANSER center in 2007 and is its current director.  The center's goal is to develop the fundamental understanding, materials, and methods necessary to create efficient and economically viable technologies for solar fuels and electricity production. The union of synthesis, measurement, theory, and engineering allows ANSER to create exceptional new energy conversion systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.research.northwestern.edu/centers/centers_details/centers_anser.html Northwestern University Office of Research&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its $777 million effort to establish Energy Frontier Research Centers, Grants provided by the US Department of Energy will enable the ANSER "to analyse photosynthesis for ways to create more efficient photovoltaic cells and create [[hybrid solar cell]]s that have both organic and inorganic components."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/2009/091022/full/nj7267-1158a.html Naturejobs.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://campustechnology.com/articles/2009/05/05/energy-dept.-commits-777-million-to-energy-frontier-research-centers.aspx Campus Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The ANSER Center was established in July 2007 and joins established strengths at [http://www.northwestern.edu/ Northwestern University] (NU) and [http://www.anl.gov/ Argonne National Laboratory] (Argonne) with those of senior personnel at [http://www.yale.edu/ Yale University], the [http://illinois.edu/ University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] (UIUC), and the [http://www.uchicago.edu/ University of Chicago] (UC) in molecular and nanostructured assemblies, materials, catalysts, and phenomena integral to solar energy conversion and storage.

'''Vision'''&lt;br /&gt;
The long-term vision of the ANSER Center is to develop the fundamental understanding, materials and methods necessary to create dramatically more efficient technologies for solar fuels and electricity production. The center plans to achieve this vision by designing and synthesizing new nanoscale architectures and studying them to deepen the understanding of basic solar energy conversion phenomena. The union of synthesis, measurement, theory, and engineering will allow ANSER to create exceptional new energy conversion systems. At the same time, the ANSER Center seeks to create and mentor a technically excellent workforce capable of solving energy-related problems far into the future.

'''Objective'''&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of multi-disciplinary research carried out by the ANSER Center is to develop a fundamental understanding of the:
-Interaction of light and charge with molecules and materials &lt;br /&gt;
-Energy levels and electronic structures of molecules and materials &lt;br /&gt;
-Dynamics of photo-induced charge generation, separation, and transport with unparalleled temporal and spatial resolution &lt;br /&gt;
-Interfaces at which charge generation, separation, transport, and selective chemical reactions occur &lt;br /&gt;
-Properties of unique materials, from self-assembling, bio-inspired materials for hydrogen fuel production from water to transparent conductors, and nanostructured hard and soft materials for solar electricity generation

'''Education and Outreach'''&lt;br /&gt;
The ANSER Center works closely with the NU-based National Center for Learning and Teaching in Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NCLT) to develop outreach programs to the science education community. NCLT participants include Argonne and UIUC, among others as primary partners. ANSER holds joint summer programs with NCLT in the area of undergraduate solar cell and nanotechnology research, professional development, summer research for science teachers, and year-round research with faculty members from partnering minority institutions. Web-based educational materials on solar energy conversion and Web podcasts on topics in the field of solar energy conversion are currently under development.

[[Image:Truck aerodynamics.jpg|right|thumb|350px|A truck with added bodywork on top of the cab to reduce drag.]]'''Automotive aerodynamics''' is the study of the [[aerodynamics]] of road vehicles.  Its main goals are reducing [[drag (physics)|drag]] and wind noise, minimizing [[roadway noise|noise emission]], and preventing undesired [[lift (force)|lift]] forces and other causes of [[Oversteer#Aerodynamic stability|aerodynamic instability]] at high speeds.  Air is also considered a fluid in this case.  For some classes of racing vehicles, it may also be important to produce [[downforce]] to improve traction and this cornering abilities.

==History==
The frictional force of aerodynamic drag increases significantly with vehicle speed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=37IHClTXkIEC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22automobile+aerodynamics&amp;ei=p0oGR5fPO6bqoQLVvKyqDQ&amp;sig=rHKVxloak0qgjaM2ikon66vxEPA] Tuncer Cebeci, Jian P. Shao, Fassi Kafyeke, Eric Laurendeau, ''Computational Fluid Dynamics for Engineers: From Panel to Navier-Stokes'', Springer, 2005, {{ISBN|3-540-24451-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as the 1920s engineers began to consider automobile shape in reducing aerodynamic drag at higher speeds. By the 1950s German and British automotive engineers were systematically analyzing the effects of automotive drag for the higher performance vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings: Institution of Mechanical Engineers (Great Britain). Automobile Division: Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Great Britain (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 1960s scientists also became aware of the significant increase in sound levels emitted by automobiles at high speed.  These effects were understood to increase the intensity of sound levels for adjacent land uses at a non-linear rate.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan &amp; Gary L. Latshaw, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/2930880 ''The relationship between highway planning and urban noise''], Proceedings of the ASCE, Urban Transportation Division specialty conference, May 21/23, 1973, Chicago, Illinois.
by American Society of Civil Engineers. Urban Transportation Division&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon highway engineers began to .design roadways to consider the speed effects of aerodynamic drag produced sound levels, and automobile manufacturers considered the same factors in vehicle design.

==Features of Aerodynamic Vehicles==
[[File:Aerodynamics of model car.jpg|thumb|Streaklines over a model car]]
An aerodynamic automobile will integrate the [[wheel]] arcs and lights into the overall shape to reduce drag. It will be [[streamliner|streamlined]]; for example, it does not have sharp edges crossing the wind stream above the [[windshield]] and will feature a sort of tail called a [[fastback]] or [[Kammback]] or [[liftback]].
Note that the [[Aptera 2e]], the [[Loremo]], and the [[Volkswagen 1-litre car]] try to reduce the area of their back.
It will have a flat and smooth floor to support the [[Venturi effect]] and produce desirable downwards aerodynamic forces. - is used for cooling, [[combustion]], and for passengers, then reaccelerated by a [[nozzle]] and then ejected under the floor.
For mid and rear engines air is decelerated and pressurized in a diffuser, loses some pressure as it passes the engine bay, and fills the [[slipstream]]. These cars need a seal between the low pressure region around the wheels and the high pressure around the gearbox.
They all have a closed engine bay floor.
The [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] is either streamlined ([[Aptera Typ-1|Aptera]]) or retracted.
[[Door handle]]s, the antenna, and roof rails can have a streamlined shape. The side mirror can only have a round fairing as a nose.
Air flow through the wheel-bays is said to increase drag ([https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article1930599/Neue_Aero-Raeder_senken_Spritverbrauch.html German source]) though race cars need it for brake cooling and many cars emit the air from the radiator into the wheel bay.

==Comparison with Aircraft Aerodynamics==
Automotive aerodynamics differs from aircraft aerodynamics in several ways.  First, the characteristic shape of a road vehicle is much less streamlined compared to an aircraft.  Second, the vehicle operates very close to the ground, rather than in free air.  Third, the operating speeds are lower (and aerodynamic [[Drag (physics)|drag]] varies as the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of speed).  Fourth, a ground vehicle has fewer [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] than an aircraft, and its motion is less affected by aerodynamic forces.  Fifth, passenger and commercial ground vehicles have very specific design constraints such as their intended purpose, high safety standards (requiring, for example, more 'dead' structural space to act as crumple zones), and certain regulations.

==Methods of Studying Aerodynamics==
[[File:Human-Mediated-Dispersal-of-Seeds-by-the-Airflow-of-Vehicles-pone.0052733.s001.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=7.5|One of the side effects of automotive aerodynamics is [[seed dispersal]].]]
Automotive aerodynamics is studied using both [[Computational fluid dynamics|computer modelling]] and [[wind tunnel]] testing. For the most accurate results from a wind tunnel test, the tunnel is sometimes equipped with a rolling road. This is a movable floor for the working section, which moves at the same speed as the air flow. This prevents a [[boundary layer]] from forming on the floor of the working section and affecting the results.

== Drag Coefficient and Drag Area ==
{{main|Automobile drag coefficient}}
[[Drag coefficient]] (C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) is a commonly published rating of a car's aerodynamic smoothness, related to the shape of the car. Multiplying C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; by the car's frontal area gives an index of total drag. The result is called ''drag area'', and is listed below for several cars. The width and height of curvy cars lead to gross overestimation of frontal area. These numbers use the manufacturer's frontal area specifications from the Mayfield Company unless noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Index to Coefficient of Drag for Many Vehicles Plus Index to Horsepower vs Speed Curves|author=Larry Mayfield|date=c. 2013|url=http://www.mayfco.com/tbls.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drag area figures that do not reflect drag coefficient and frontal area figures from independent aerodynamic testing (e.g. drag areas based on manufacturer-reported figures or educated speculation) are indicated with an asterisk (*).

== Downforce ==
{{Main|Downforce}}
Downforce describes the downward pressure created by the [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] characteristics of a [[car]] that allows it to travel faster through a corner by holding the car to the track or road surface. Some elements to increase vehicle downforce will also increase drag.
It is very important to produce a good downward aerodynamic force because it affects the car's speed and traction.&lt;ref&gt;"Background Research." Automobile Aerodynamics. 18 May 2008.

}}'''The history of Azerishiq OJSC''' has also been formed in [[Baku]] with the history of electricity. The first power plant in Baku was installed in 1895 in the "Bakinski dock" on Bayil highway. In 1903, the number of power stations reached 70.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerishiq.az/index.php?lang=en&amp;menu=about&amp;id=10|title=AZƏRİŞIQ ASC|website=www.azerishiq.az|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1880, the cruise ship company "Qafqaz and Mercury" in the Volga River and the Caspian Sea had installed new electric lanterns at the passenger port in Baku.

On January 21, 1899, the Baku Branch of the Berlin Joint Stock Company "Elektricheskaya Sila" was established in the city, which was a branch of Siemens Galske's 1886 Electricity Lighting Society. This firm was involved in financing, design and survey works, construction, equipment and supplies.

One of the members of the Executive Board of the Baku Branch of the "Electricheskie Sila" was millionaire Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev. The founders of the society were Baron Vrangel, graphic I. Golenishev-Kutuzov-Tolstoy, and real civil consultant V. Golubev.

Along with foreign investment, the share of local investment increased by Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev, Musa Nagiyev, Isa Bey Hacinski, Shamsi Asadullayev, Murtuza Mukhtarov and others.

The Elektrieskaya Sila joint stock company has been engaged in the preparation of hiring laboratories, conducting correspondence with various organizations, oil owners, businessmen, the city administration, and hiring laborers and inviting specialists before starting construction. At the beginning of 1900 the management of the Baku department prepared a report compiled by figures and calculations. Immediately after that, Siemens and Galske started building Bibi-Heybat - Bayil Nose and Beliy Gorod's second power plant.

At the beginning of July 1901, Bibi-Heybat Power Station was tested, and a week later the station was put into operation. One year later, the Beliy Gorod power plant was commissioned to supply oil to Sabunchu and to the oil refineries in Chorniy-Gorod.

More than 50% of the electricity used by the Nobel Brothers' Association and Baron Rothschild's "Caspian-Black Sea Oil Industry and Commodity Society".

In March 1906, two 8.1&amp;nbsp;km voltage lines were constructed from the power station in Beliy Gorod to Balakhani oil filed.

In 1916, 1638 of 3750 bore mining functioning in Absheron were electrified.

The next development took place in 1909-1920. At the same time, air and cable networks were strengthened. More than 60 transformer and distribution points were set up in Balakhani, Ramana and Surakhani districts. In 1913, Bibi-Heybat had to be expanded, as the station's reserves were exhausted. At that time, an agreement was reached to join the 50 wells of "Oleum i Born" company.&lt;ref&gt;Alaskarov, K. (July 27, 2002). "V lunnıe noçi kerosinovıe fonari ne qoryat?". ''"Zerkalo" newspaper.''

== Structure ==
Baku electricity grid has been operating in the following structures since 1920:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Until 1929 it was a member of Azneft's "Electrotok" department.
* In 1929, the Central Executive Committee of the USSR passed the decision to the Baku City Council.
* In 1963, by the Decree of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan, it was transferred to the Ministry of Azerenerji.
* From 1969 to 2000, it was a member of the Executive Committee of Baku City Executive Committee.
* By the order of the president from 2000 to 2002, it was transferred to the Ministry of Economic Development as "Bakielektrikshebeke" OJSC.
* From 2002 to 2006, it was managed by Turkish Barmek Holding A.Ş.

== Developments ==
The construction phase of the work, the construction of large semi-substations, transmission lines, and production facilities has been widening since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On October 20, 2000 the first turn of Baku-Heating Center No. 1 is put into operation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After restoration of Bakielektrikshebeke's activity in 2006, an order was issued to allocate funds from the Presidential Reserve Fund for the development and investment in this area in accordance with modern standards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By the decree signed by President on February 10, 2015, the name of Bakielectricshebeke OJSC changed into Azerishiq OJSC. Balababa Rzayev appointed as president of Azerishiq. Functions of Azerenerji OJSC including all its property and electric energy supply equipment was transferred to Azerishiq from The Cabinet of Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://caspianenergy.net/en/energy/18911-bakielektrikshebeke-ojsc-renamed-into-azerishiq-ojsc|title=Caspian Energy - Bakielektrikshebeke OJSC renamed into Azerishiq OJSC|work=Caspian Energy|access-date=2018-11-13|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://caspianbarrel.org/az/2015/02/bakus-electric-energy-distribution-network-to-control-entire-country/|title=Baku’s electric energy distribution network to control entire country – Caspian Barrel|website=caspianbarrel.org|language=az|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Azerishiq prepared “Power distribution Modernization Project” with the financial help of World Bank. The aim of the project is development and modernization of the distribution network, improvement of reliable power supply, and enhance efficient energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azerishiq.az/upload/files/RPF_WB_draft_eng.pdf Azerbaijan: Power Distribution Modernization Project (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1236">'''Backstay insulators''', when used as a pair, are devices which allow for the [[electrical]] isolation of a section of wire on a [[yacht]] (e.g. the [[backstay]]) so that it can be used as an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] for a [[Single-sideband modulation|single sideband]] (SSB) [[radio]].

Since these [[insulator (electricity)|insulators]] form part of the rigging, not only must they not leak [[Electric current|current]], but they must also be strong and durable enough not to fail mechanically under the sometimes tough load conditions experienced in [[sailing]].

Manufacturers include [[Hi-MOD]], [[Norseman-Gibb]] and [[Sta-Lok]].  Each design is slightly different, but all share the common characteristics of having two attachment points set back-to-back and separated by some insulating material. 

The Hi-MOD system has been designed in such a way that if the [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] material (typically some sort of [[plastic]]) were to fail mechanically, the fitting would retain [[structural integrity]], keeping the wire from separating even when it stops functioning as an insulator.

'''Bath Cabinet Makers Ltd.''' traded for sixty-seven years (1892–1959){{sfn|Festing|1998|p=146}} in a city, [[Bath, Somerset]], England, with a history of furniture-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Furniture Made in Bath|journal=Holbourne Museum Exhibition Catalogue|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under management of Charles A Richter (1876–1945) until 1934, its work was regularly illustrated in ''[[The Studio (magazine)|The Studio]]'' and the company soon began to receive international prizes.{{sfn|Festing|1998|p=157}} A variety of styles was produced, from Parisian-inspired versions of 'Adam' to [[Art Nouveau]], [[Art Deco]], [[Arts and Crafts]] and streamlined Modern in a huge range of woods, solid and veneer.{{sfn|Payne|1981|p=23}} Important contracts included furniture and fittings for [[Cunard]]'s luxury liners, the [[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]] and [[RMS Queen Elizabeth|Queen Elizabeth]]. A proportion of its output was mass-produced for cheaper markets although the workmanship was always of a high standard.

==History==
Built in 1895, the factory on Bellots Road, [[Twerton]] was one of the largest and best equipped in the country.{{sfn|Payne|1981|p=23}} Bath Timber Supply Ltd and Bath Guild of Handicraft and Design were set up in the 1920s to support Bath Cabinet Makers. George Montague Elwood was responsible for many of the [[Art Nouveau]] pieces around 1899–1900, but most of Bath Cabinet Makers's furniture was designed by the Richter brothers, Charles Augustus (1867–1946), Herbert Davis (1874–1955) and their team.{{sfn|Payne|1981|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bath Cabinet Makers|url=http://www.marvellousfurniture.co.uk/bathcabinetmakers.html|publisher=The Marvellous Furniture co|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Richter became president of the National Federation of Furniture Trades{{sfn|Festing|1998|p=162}} and was appointed to [[Baron Gorell|Lord Gorell's]] Commission on improving the standard of art in industry.&lt;ref name=Richter /&gt; In JC Rogers' Modern English Furniture (1930) he is one of forty-two designers listed beside the better-known [[Barnsley brothers|Barnsleys]] and [[Edwin Lutyens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=JC|title=Modern English Furniture|journal=Country Life Publications|date=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bath Cabinet Makers owed its existence to a strike at F and A Norris Brothers' Bath's Albion Cabinet Works in December 1891. The following year, Charles Richter, an employee at Albion, launched the Bath and West Co-operative Cabinet Makers Ltd. The intention was determinedly idealistic; men needed jobs and the city provided enterprise. Shareholders were represented by a committee five members, one of whom was the influential Cedric Chivers from the bookbinding family. Richter was elected general manager the following month, and work began in rented accommodation.{{sfn|Festing|1998|pp=153–154}}

In 1892 the name was contracted to The Bath Cabinet Makers Ltd. The next year, Charles Richter walked out, objecting to the Shareholders' reluctance to expand. Two years later the Society called him back as managing director, with Herbert Davis Richter Head of the Design Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keevil|first=HT|title=History of Bath Cabinet Makers|date=1956|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Davis Richter's drawings were reproduced in all the relevant leading architectural journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fell Granville|first=H|title=1900|journal=Art Journal special edition published for the Paris World Exhibition}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 the brothers collaborated with Messrs Silcock and Reay on the design of a distinctive new building.{{sfn|Festing|1998|pp=157–158}} In 1900, the firm won five medals at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris World Exhibition]].{{sfn|Granville Fell|1935|pp=13–14}}

==Later years==
Prior to [[World War I]], Bath Cabinet Makers furniture was on constant display in London stores such as Maples and [[Harrods]].{{sfn|Festing|1998|p=161}}
While Herbert Davis Richter left Bath Cabinet Makers in 1906 to become a painter,{{sfn|Granville Fell|1935|p=16}}  Charles Richter's hope of early retirement were interrupted by the war. The factories were converted to manufacture aircraft parts, to be restored to panelling, joinery and high-class furniture when the war ended. The family interest was extended when Herbert Davis Richter's wife, Gertrude, and Charles Richter's sister, Florence Schottler, launched The Guild of Handicraft and Design to make soft furnishings for large contracts coming in from America, India and Germany.{{sfn|Festing|1998|p=162}} Further recognition was earned at the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley]] of 1924 and the [[International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts|Paris Exhibition]] of 1925.{{sfn|Festing|1998|p=162}}  CAR's elder son Ian joined the firm in the early 1920s and became managing director in 1934. He produced some fine wood carvings that were used in the setting of BCM furniture, many on the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth|Queen Elizabeth]]. The 1930s depression affected demand for luxury furniture but Charles Richter managed to keep his firm afloat.

==Idealism of Charles A Richter== 
[[File:Richter table 1.jpg|thumb|Table in walnut with black insets, designed by CA Richter]]
[[William Morris]] considered that machines were responsible for bad design. As handwork was necessarily time-consuming, his furniture was too expensive for the very people he wanted to supply. In contrast, Charles Richter, a committed socialist and natural progressive, deplored asking men to perform arduous tasks that could easily be accomplished by machine.{{sfn|Festing|1998|p=147}}  In Bath Cabinet Makers's early days, he set up an Education Committee and ran games and dramatic clubs.{{sfn|Festing|1998|p=157}}  Acquainted with [[GB Shaw]], he asked the playwright down to Bath for a performance of Caesar and Cleopatra.{{sfn|Festing|1998|p=164}}

==Post-war==
In 1959 the firm was taken over by Yatton Furniture, its name and the goodwill lasted for more than a century.{{sfn|Festing|1998|p=146}}  Plagiarism had been a continual battle. From the outset Bath Cabinet Makers's prolific output and range of styles led to pirating by other companies.{{sfn|Festing|1998|p=160}}&lt;ref name= Richter&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: C.A.Richter
|newspaper=The Furnishing World|date=1946 | page=80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to much of their work being attributed to other firms. Current research into Wylie &amp; Lochhead and Bath Cabinet Makers reveals that prestigious museums throughout the country have believed that Bath Cabinet Makers furniture was made by the Scottish cabinet-making firm.&lt;ref&gt;Holbourne Museum Bath&lt;/ref&gt;

The company became part of the Christie-Tyler furniture group and in 1986 was bought out by Ken Fullalove, one of their directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bath craftsman honoured for lifetime devoted to furniture making  |url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/Bath-craftsman-honoured-lifetime-devoted/story-17394070-detail/story.html|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=Bath Chronicle|date=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boiling''' is the rapid [[vaporization]] of a [[liquid]], which occurs when a liquid is heated to its [[boiling point]], the [[temperature]] at which the [[vapour pressure]] of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding atmosphere. There are two main types of boiling ; nucleate boiling where small bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and critical heat flux boiling where the boiling surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film of vapor forms on the surface. Transition boiling is an intermediate, unstable form of boiling with elements of both types. The boiling point of water is 100 °C or 212 °F but is lower with the decreased atmospheric pressure found at higher altitudes.

Boiling water is used as a method of making it potable by killing [[Microorganism|microbes]] that may be present. The sensitivity of different micro-organisms to heat varies, but if water is held at 70 °C (158 °F) for ten minutes, many organisms are killed, but some are more resistant to heat and require one minute at the boiling point of water.

Boiling is also used in cooking. Foods suitable for boiling include vegetables, starchy foods such as rice, noodles and potatoes, eggs, meats, sauces, stocks, and soups. As a cooking method, it is simple and suitable for large-scale cookery. Tough meats or poultry can be given a long, slow cooking and a nutritious stock is produced. Disadvantages include loss of water-soluble vitamins and minerals. Commercially prepared foodstuffs are sometimes packed in polythene sachets and sold as "boil-in-the-bag" products.

== Types ==

=== Nucleate ===
[[Image:Kochendes wasser02.jpg|thumb|right|Nucleate boiling of water over a kitchen stove burner]]

''[[Nucleate boiling]]'' is characterized by the growth of bubbles or pops on a heated surface, which rises from discrete points on a surface, whose temperature is only slightly above the liquids. In general, the number of [[nucleation]] sites are increased by an increasing surface temperature.

An irregular surface of the boiling vessel (i.e., increased surface roughness) or additives to the fluid (i.e., surfactants and/or nanoparticles&lt;ref&gt;http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/923/1/012004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;Taylor, R.A., Phelan, P.E., ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931009004153 Pool boiling of nanofluids: Comprehensive review of existing data and limited new data]'', International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 52, Issues 23–24, November 2009, Pages 5339–5347&lt;/ref&gt;) can create additional nucleation sites,&lt;ref&gt;Robert A Taylor, Patrick E Phelan, Todd Otanicar, Ronald J Adrian, Ravi S Prasher, ''[http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=mech_fac Vapor generation in a nanoparticle liquid suspension using a focused, continuous laser]'', Applied Physics Letters, Volume:95 ,  Issue: 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; while an exceptionally smooth surface, such as plastic, lends itself to [[superheating]]. Under these conditions, a heated liquid may show [[boiling delay]] and the temperature may go somewhat above the boiling point without boiling.

===Critical heat flux===
As the boiling surface is heated above a critical temperature, a film of vapor forms on the surface. Since this vapor film is much less capable of carrying heat away from the surface, the temperature rises very rapidly beyond this point into the [[transition boiling]] regime. The point at which this occurs is dependent on the characteristics of boiling fluid and the heating surface in question.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

===Transition===
''[[Transition boiling]]'' may be defined as the unstable boiling, which occurs at surface temperatures between the maximum attainable in nucleate and the minimum attainable in film boiling.

The formation of [[Liquid bubble|bubbles]] in a heated liquid is a complex physical process which often involves [[cavitation]] and acoustic effects, such as the broad-spectrum hiss one hears in a kettle not yet heated to the point where bubbles boil to the surface.

===Film===
{{main|Leidenfrost effect}}

If a surface heating the liquid is significantly hotter than the liquid then film boiling will occur, where a thin layer of vapor, which has low [[thermal conductivity]], insulates the surface. This condition of a vapor film insulating the surface from the liquid characterizes ''film boiling''.

As a method of disinfecting water, bringing it to its boiling point at {{convert|100|°C}}, is the oldest and most effective way since it does not affect the taste, it is effective despite contaminants or particles present in it, and is a single step process which eliminates most [[microbes]] responsible for causing [[intestine]] related diseases.&lt;ref name=Oxfordjournals&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Disinfection for International and Wilderness Travelers|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/3/355.full|publisher= Oxford journals|accessdate=20 July 2013|author=Howard Backer|pages=355&amp;ndash;364|doi=10.1086/324747|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to WolframAlpha, water's boiling point rests at around 100.3 degrees celcius, when at an elevation of 0. &lt;ref&gt;http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=waters+boiling+point+at+0+metres+above+sea+level&lt;/ref&gt; In places having a proper [[water purification]] system, it is recommended only as an emergency treatment method or for obtaining potable water in the wilderness or in rural areas,&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency Disinfection of Drinking Water|url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/emerprep/emergencydisinfection.cfm#method| publisher=EPA|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it cannot remove [[toxins|chemical toxins]] or impurities.&lt;ref name="backpackers field manual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~oa/manual/water.shtml|title=OA Guide to Water Purification, The Backpacker's Field Manual, by Rick Curtis, first edition published by Random House March, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elimination of micro-organisms by boiling follows [[first-order kinetics]]&amp;mdash;at high temperatures, it is achieved in less time and at lower temperatures, in more time. The heat sensitivity of micro-organisms varies, at {{convert|70|°C}}, [[Giardia]] species (causes [[Giardiasis]]) can take ten minutes for complete inactivation, most intestine affecting microbes and ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' ([[gastroenteritis]]) take less than a minute; at boiling point, ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''  ([[cholera]]) takes ten seconds and [[hepatitis A virus]] (causes the symptom of [[jaundice]]), one minute. Boiling does not ensure the elimination of all micro-organisms; the bacterial spores [[Clostridium]] can survive at {{convert|100|°C}} but are not water-borne or intestine affecting. Thus for human health, complete [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] of water is not required.&lt;ref name="Oxfordjournals"/&gt;

The traditional advice of boiling water for ten minutes is mainly for additional safety, since microbes start getting eliminated at temperatures greater than {{convert|60|°C}} and bringing it to its boiling point is also a useful indication that can be seen without the help of a [[thermometer]], and by this time, the water is disinfected. Though the [[Atmospheric pressure boiling point|boiling point decreases]] with increasing altitude, it is not enough to affect the disinfecting process.&lt;ref name="Oxfordjournals"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it true that you can't make a decent cup of tea up a mountain?|url=http://www.physics.org/facts/air-tea.asp|publisher=physics.org| accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boiling point of water is typically considered to be 100&amp;nbsp;°C or 212&amp;nbsp;°F. Pressure and a change in the composition of the liquid may alter the boiling point of the liquid. For this reason, high [[elevation]] cooking generally takes longer since boiling point is a function of [[atmospheric pressure]]. In [[Denver]], Colorado, USA, which is at an elevation of about one mile, water boils at approximately 95&amp;nbsp;°C or 203&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapws.org/faq1/boil.htm|author=IAPWS|authorlink=IAPWS|work=FAQs About Water and Steam|title=What is the effect of pressure on the boiling of water? Why does water boil at a lower temperature at high altitudes?|accessdate=2009-12-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806060431/http://www.iapws.org/faq1/boil.htm|archivedate=2009-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the type of food and the elevation, the boiling water may not be hot enough to cook the food properly. Similarly, increasing the pressure as in a [[pressure cooker]] raises the temperature of the contents above the open air boiling point.

Some science suggests adding a water-[[solubility|soluble]] substance, such as [[salt]] or [[sugar]] also increases the boiling point. This is called [[boiling-point elevation]]. At palatable concentrations of salt, the effect is very small, and the boiling point elevation is difficult to notice and this is why experiments to prove this are considered inconclusive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=boiling-point elevation. A Dictionary of Chemistry.|last=Rennie|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780198722823|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, while making thick sugar syrup, such as for [[Gulab Jamun]], one will notice boiling point elevation. Due to variations in composition and pressure, the boiling point of water is almost never exactly 100&amp;nbsp;°C, but rather close enough for cooking.

Foods suitable for boiling include vegetables, starchy foods such as [[rice]], [[noodle]]s and [[potato]]es, eggs, meats, sauces, stocks, and soups.

Boiling has several advantages. It is safe and simple, and it is appropriate for large-scale cookery. Older, tougher, cheaper cuts of meat and poultry can be made digestible. Nutritious, well-flavored stock is produced. Also, maximum color and nutritive value is retained when cooking green vegetables, provided boiling time is kept to the minimum.
[[File:Kochen über offenem Feuer.JPG|thumb|Boiling food over a fireplace]]
On the other hand, there are several disadvantages. There is a loss of soluble vitamins from foods to the water (if the water is discarded). Boiling can also be a slow method of cooking food.

Boiling can be done in several ways: The food can be placed into already rapidly boiling water and left to cook, the heat can be turned down and the food can be simmered or the food can also be placed into the pot, and cold water may be added to the pot. This may then be boiled until the food is satisfactory.

Water on the outside of a pot, i.e., a wet pot, increases the time it takes the pot of water to boil. The pot will heat at a normal rate once all excess water on the outside of the pot evaporates.

Boiling is also often used to remove salt from certain foodstuffs, such as bacon if a less saline product is required.

===Boil-in-the-bag===
{{mainarticle|Boil-in-bag}}
{{See also|Sous-vide}}
Also known as "boil-in-bag", this involves heating or cooking ready-made foods sealed in a thick plastic bag. The bag containing the food, often frozen, is submerged in boiling water for a prescribed time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/boil-in-bag|title=Boil-in-bag - Define Boil-in-bag at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting dishes can be prepared with greater convenience as no pots or pans are dirtied in the process. Such meals are available for camping as well as home dining.

==Contrast with evaporation==

At any given temperature, all the molecules in a liquid do not have the same kinetic energy. Some high energy particles on the liquid surface may have enough energy to escape the intermolecular forces of attraction of the liquid and become a gas. This is called evaporation. 

Evaporation only happens on the surface while boiling happens throughout the liquid.
When a liquid reaches its boiling point bubbles of gas form in it which rise into the surface and burst into the air. This process is called boiling. If the boiling liquid is heated more strongly the temperature does not rise but the liquid boils more quickly.

This distinction is exclusive to the liquid-to-gas transition; any transition directly from solid to gas is always referred to as [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] regardless of whether it is at its boiling point or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1349">The '''conical refiner''' is a machine used in the refining of pulp in the papermaking process.  It may also be referred to as a Jordan refiner, after the American inventor Joseph Jordan who patented the device in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780080533681|title=Handbook of Pulping and Papermaking|last1=Biermann|first1=C|publisher=Academic Press|date=1996|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfZfyEmqs_AC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jordan refiner.jpg|Jordan patent|thumb]]

The conical refiner is a chamber with metal bars mounted around the inside of the container.  The material to be refined is pumped into the chamber at high-pressure rate in order to create an abrasive effect as the material is forced through the machine, abraided by the metal bars.  At the opposite end of the chamber the resulting pulp is pumped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=197|isbn=9781483279602|title=The Paper-making Machine: Its Invention, Evolution, and Development|last1=Clapperton|first1=R.

'''''Phoenix dactylifera''''', commonly known as '''date''' or '''date palm''',&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a flowering plant species in the palm family, [[Arecaceae]], cultivated for its edible sweet fruit. Although its place of origin is unknown because of long cultivation, it probably originated from the [[Fertile Crescent]] region straddling between Egypt and [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name="Krueger"&gt;{{cite web | last=Krueger | first=Robert R | title=Date Palm Genetic Resource Conservation, Breeding, Genetics, And Genomics In California | publisher=The Conference Exchange | url=https://pag.confex.com/pag/xx/recordingredirect.cgi/id/137 | format=PDF | accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species is widely cultivated across Northern Africa, The Middle East, The Horn of Africa and South Asia, and is naturalized in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=152659 Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, ''Phoenix dactylifera'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bonap.net/MapGallery/County/Phoenix%20dactylifera.png Biota of North America Project,  ''Phoenix dactylifera'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=200027092 Flora of China, v 253 p 143,  ''Phoenix dactylifera'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. dactylifera'' is the [[type species]] of genus ''[[Phoenix (plant)|Phoenix]]'', which contains 12–19 species of wild date palms, and is the major source of commercial production.&lt;ref name="Krueger"/&gt;

Date trees typically reach about {{convert|21|-|23|m|ft}} in height,&lt;ref name="Divya Bichu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/arabian-desert-plants.html|title=Arabian Desert Plants|author=Divya Bichu|work=Buzzle|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; growing singly or forming a clump with several stems from a single root system. Date fruits (dates) are oval-cylindrical, 3–7 cm (1.2–2.8 in) long, and about an inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, ranging from bright red to bright yellow in color, depending on variety. They are very sweet, containing about 75 percent of [[sugar]] when dried.

Dates have been a [[staple food]] of the Middle East and the [[Indus Valley]] for thousands of years. There is archaeological evidence of date cultivation in Arabia from the 6th millennium BCE. The total annual world production of dates amounts to 8.5 million [[metric tons]], countries of the Middle East and North Africa being the largest producers.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;{{cite web|title=FAOSTAT:Crops |url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC |at=Elements:Production Quantity / Items:Dates / Years:2016 |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The species name ''dactylifera'' "date-bearing" comes from the [[Greek Language|Greek]] words ''daktylos'' (δάκτυλος), which means "date" (also "finger"),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|da/ktulos|δάκτυλος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''fero'' (φέρω), which means "I bear".&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|fero|fĕro|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fruit]] is known as a date.&lt;ref&gt;"Date Palm". 15 October 2008. HowStuffWorks.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The fruit's English name (through Old French), as well as the Latin both come from the Greek word for "finger", ''dáktulos'', because of the fruit's elongated shape.

==History==
Fossil records show that the date palm has existed for at least 50 million years.&lt;ref name=NPRmedjool&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15282847|title=Medjool: A Date to Remember|date=17 October 2007|work=NPR.org|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dates have been a [[staple food]] of the [[Middle East]] and the [[Indus Valley]] for thousands of years. There is archaeological evidence of date cultivation in eastern [[Arabia]] between 5530 and 5320 [[Radiocarbon dating#Calibration|calBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tengberg |first1=M. |title=Beginnings and early history of date palm garden cultivation in the Middle East |journal=Journal of Arid Environments |date=November 2012 |volume=86 |pages=139–147 |doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2011.11.022 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140196311003569}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are believed to have originated around what is now Iraq, and have been cultivated since ancient times from [[Mesopotamia]] to prehistoric [[Egypt]]. The Ancient Egyptians used the fruits to make date [[wine]], and ate them at harvest.

There is archeological evidence of date cultivation in [[Mehrgarh]] around 7000 BCE, a Neolithic civilization in what is now western [[Pakistan]].  Evidence of cultivation is continually found throughout later civilizations in the Indus Valley, including the [[Harappa]]n period 2600 to 1900 BCE.&lt;ref name="KenoyerHeuston2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kenoyer |first1=Jonathan Mark |last2=Heuston |first2=Kimberley Burton |title=The Ancient South Asian World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CjvF88iEE8C&amp;pg=PP1 |accessdate=30 July 2013 |series=The World in Ancient Times |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-522243-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}

In [[Ancient Rome]] the palm fronds used in [[Roman triumph|triumphal]] processions to symbolize victory were most likely those of ''Phoenix dactylifera''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Top 100 Food Plants | author=Ernest Small| year=2009 | p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date palm was a popular garden plant in Roman [[peristyle]] gardens, though it would not bear fruit in the more temperate climate of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Ancient Roman Gardens | author=Linda Farrar | year=1998| p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recognizable in frescoes from [[Pompeii]] and elsewhere in Italy, including a garden scene from the House of the Wedding of Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Ancient Roman Gardens | author=Linda Farrar | year=1998| p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later times, traders spread dates around South West [[Asia]], [[North Africa|northern Africa]], and [[Spain]]. Dates were introduced into [[Mexico]] and [[California]] by the Spaniards in 1765, around [[Misión San Ignacio Kadakaamán|Mission San Ignacio]].

A date palm [[cultivar]], probably what used to be called [[Judean date palm]], is renowned for its long-lived [[orthodox seed]], which successfully sprouted after accidental storage for 2000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Hanson| first = Wendy|title = Date palm seed from Masada is the oldest to germinate|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|pages =|date = 2008-06-13|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/13/science/sci-methuselah13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper survival time limit of properly stored seeds remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Bonner|first = Franklin T.|authorlink =|title = Chapter 4 Storage of Seeds|work = Woody Plant Seed Manual, USDA FS Agriculture Handbook 727| publisher = National Seed Laboratory, 5675 Riggins Mill Rd, Dry Branch, GA 31020|date = April 2008|url = http://www.nsl.fs.fed.us/Chapter%204.pdf |accessdate = 2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Kajur.jpg|thumb|Date fruit clumps]]

Date trees typically reach about {{convert|21|-|23|m|ft}} in height,&lt;ref name="Divya Bichu"/&gt; growing singly or forming a clump with several stems from a single root system. The leaves are {{convert|4|-|6|m|ft}} long, with spines on the [[petiole (botany)|petiole]], and [[pinnate]], with about 150 leaflets. The leaflets are {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The full span of the crown ranges from {{convert|6|-|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

The date palm is [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], having separate male and female plants. They can be easily grown from seed, but only 50% of seedlings will be female and hence fruit bearing, and dates from seedling plants are often smaller and of poorer quality. Most commercial plantations thus use [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of heavily cropping cultivars. Plants grown from cuttings will fruit 2–3 years earlier than seedling plants.

Dates are naturally wind [[pollination|pollinated]], but in both traditional [[oasis]] [[horticulture]] and in the modern commercial orchards they are entirely [[hand pollination|pollinated manually]]. Natural pollination occurs with about an equal number of male and female plants. However, with assistance, one male can [[pollinate]] up to 100 females. Since the males are of value only as pollinators, this allows the growers to use their resources for many more fruit-producing female plants. Some growers do not even maintain any male plants, as male flowers become available at local markets at pollination time. Manual pollination is done by skilled labourers on [[ladder]]s, or by use of a wind machine. In some areas such as Iraq the pollinator climbs the tree using a special climbing tool that wraps around the tree trunk and the climber's back (called تبلية in Arabic) to keep him attached to the trunk while climbing.

[[Image:Freshdates.JPG|thumb|Fresh dates, clockwise from top right: crunchy, crunchy opened, soft out of skin, soft]]

Date fruits are oval-cylindrical, {{convert|3|-|7|cm|abbr=on|in}} long, and {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter, and when ripe, range from bright red to bright yellow in colour, depending on variety. Dates contain a single [[Drupe|stone]] about {{convert|2|-|2.5|cm|abbr=on|1}} long and {{convert|6|-|8|mm|abbr=on|1}} thick. Three main [[cultivar group]]s of date exist: soft (e.g. 'Barhee', 'Halawy', 'Khadrawy', '[[Medjool]]'), semi-dry (e.g. 'Dayri', '[[Deglet Noor]]', 'Zahdi'), and dry (e.g. 'Thoory'). The type of fruit depends on the [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[sucrose]] content.

===Genome===
In 2009, a team of researchers at the  Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar published a draft version of the date palm genome (Khalas variety).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090501162809.htm Date Palm Genome Drafted] Science Daily, January 14, 2010, Retrieved August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qatar-weill.cornell.edu/research/datepalmGenome/index.html Date Palm Draft Sequence] Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar, updated April 7, 2010, Retrieved August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
Dates are an important traditional crop in [[Iraq]], [[Arabia]], and north Africa west to [[Morocco]]. Dates (especially Medjool and Deglet Noor) are also cultivated in America in southern California, [[Arizona]] and southern [[Florida]] in the United States and in [[Sonora]] and [[Baja California]] in Mexico.

Date palms can take 4 to 8 years after planting before they will bear fruit, and start producing viable yields for commercial harvest between 7 and 10 years. Mature date palms can produce {{Convert|150|-|300|lb|abbr=on|-1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/GEPTS/pb143/CROP/DATE/date.htm|title=The Date, Phoenix dactylifera|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unce.unr.edu/publications/files/ho/2002/sp0212.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of dates per harvest season, although they do not all ripen at the same time so several harvests are required. In order to get fruit of marketable quality, the bunches of dates must be thinned and bagged or covered before ripening so that the remaining fruits grow larger and are protected from weather and pests such as birds.
{{clear}}

Date palms require well-drained deep sandy loam soils with pH 8-11. The soil should have the ability to hold the moisture. The soil should also be free from calcium carbonate.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Diseases and pests==
{{Main|List of date palm diseases}}
A major palm pest, the red palm beetle (''[[Rhynchophorus ferrugineus]]'') currently poses a significant threat to date production in parts of the Middle East as well as to iconic landscape specimens throughout the Mediterranean world.

In the 1920s, eleven healthy [[Madjool palm]]s were transferred from Morocco to the United States where they were tended by members of the [[Chemehuevi]] tribe{{which|date=January 2015}} in a remote region of Nevada. Nine of these survived and in 1935, cultivars were transferred to the "[[USDA Date Station|U.S. Date Garden]]" in [[Indio, California]]. Eventually this stock was reintroduced to Africa and led to the U.S. production of dates in [[Yuma, Arizona]] and the [[Bard Valley]] in California.&lt;ref name="ICN_Allen"&gt;{{cite news | title=How One Indian Couple Saved 'The Fruit of Kings' | first=Lee | last=Allen | work=Indian Country News | date=25 April 2014 | url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/25/how-one-indian-couple-saved-fruit-kings-154535 | accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Phoenix dactylifera3.jpg|left|thumb|Date Palm stump showing the fibrous structure]]

===Fruits===
Dry or soft dates are eaten out-of-hand, or may be pitted and stuffed with fillings such as [[almond]]s, [[walnut]]s, pecans, candied [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] and [[lemon]] [[Peel (fruit)|peel]], [[tahini]], [[marzipan]] or [[cream cheese]]. Pitted dates are also referred to as ''stoned dates''. Partially dried pitted dates may be glazed with glucose syrup for use as a snack food. Dates can also be chopped and used in a range of sweet and savory dishes, from [[tajine]]s (tagines) in [[Morocco]] to [[pudding]]s, [[ka'ak]] (types of Arab cookies) and other dessert items. Date nut bread, a type of cake, is very popular in the United States, especially around holidays. Dates are also processed into cubes, paste called "'ajwa", spread, date syrup or "honey" called "dibs" or "[[Rub (syrup)|rub]]" in Libya, powder (date sugar), [[vinegar]] or [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. Vinegar made from dates is a traditional product of the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ie50319a016 | title = Vinegar from Dates | year = 1936 | last1 = Das | first1 = Bhagwan | last2 = Sarin | first2 = J.

When Muslims break fast in the [[iftar|evening meal of Ramadan]], it is traditional to eat a date first.

Reflecting the maritime trading heritage of [[British cuisine|Britain]], imported chopped dates are added to, or form the main basis of a variety of traditional dessert recipes including [[sticky toffee pudding]], [[Christmas pudding]] and [[date and walnut loaf]]. They are particularly available to eat whole at [[Christmas]] time. Dates are one of the ingredients of [[HP Sauce]], a popular British condiment.

Dates can also be dehydrated, ground and mixed with grain to form a nutritious stockfeed.

In Southeast Spain (where a large date plantation exists including [[UNESCO]]-protected [[Palmeral of Elche]]) dates (usually pitted with fried almond) are served wrapped in [[bacon]] and shallow fried.

In [[Israel]] date syrup, termed "silan", is used while cooking chicken and also for sweet and desserts, and as a honey substitute.

Dates are one of the ingredients of [[Jallab]], a Middle-Eastern fruit syrup.

In Pakistan, a viscous, thick syrup made from the ripe fruits is used as a coating for leather bags and pipes to prevent leaking.

Dates provide a wide range of [[essential nutrients]], and are a very good source of [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary [[potassium]]. The [[sugar]] content of ripe dates is about 80%; the remainder consists of [[protein]], [[fiber]], and [[trace elements]] including [[boron]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]], [[fluorine]], [[magnesium]], [[manganese]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = [[International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition]] |year=2003 |volume = 54 |issue = 4|pages=247–259 |title = The fruit of the date palm: its possible use as the best food for the future? |author=Walid Al-Shahib, Richard J.

===Other parts===
====Seeds====
Date seeds are soaked and ground up for [[animal feed]]. Their oil is suitable for use in soap and cosmetics. Date palm seeds contain 0.56–5.4% [[lauric acid]]. They can also be processed chemically as a source of [[oxalic acid]]. Date seeds are also ground and used in the manner of [[coffee]] beans, or as an additive to coffee.
Experimental studies have shown that feeding mice with the aqueous extract of date  pits exhibit anti-genotoxic and reduce DNA damage induced by [[N-nitroso-N-methylurea]].&lt;ref name="Diab KA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diab|first=K.A|author2=E.

====Fruit clusters====
Stripped fruit clusters are used as brooms. Recently the floral stalks have been found to be of ornamental value in households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kiran | first1 = S | year = 2014 | title = Floral Stalk on Date Palm: A New Discovery | doi = 10.3329/ijarit.v4i2.22649 | journal = Int J Agril Res Innov Tech. | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sap====
[[File:Sweet sap from date palm.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Sweet [[Plant sap|sap]] tapped from date palm in [[West Bengal]], [[India]]]]

Apart from ''P. dactylifera'', wild date palms such as ''[[Phoenix sylvestris]]'' and ''[[Phoenix reclinata]]'', depending on the region, can be also tapped for sap.

====Leaves====
Date palm leaves are used for [[Palm Sunday]] in the [[Christian]] religion. In North Africa, they are commonly used for making huts. Mature leaves are also made into mats, screens, baskets and fans. Processed leaves can be used for [[Thermal insulation|insulating board]]. Dried leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]s are a source of [[cellulose]] pulp, used for walking sticks, brooms, fishing floats and fuel. Leaf sheaths are prized for their scent, and fibre from them is also used for rope, coarse cloth, and large hats. The leaves are also used as a [[lulav]] in the Jewish holiday of [[Sukkot]].

Young date leaves are cooked and eaten as a vegetable, as is the terminal bud or heart, though its removal kills the palm. The finely ground seeds are mixed with [[flour]] to make bread in times of scarcity. The flowers of the date palm are also edible. Traditionally the female flowers are the most available for sale and weigh {{Convert|300|-|400|g}}. The flower buds are used in salad or ground with dried fish to make a [[condiment]] for bread.

==Culture==
[[File:Emblem of Saudi Arabia.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|right|Date Palm in the [[Coat of arms of Saudi Arabia|Coat of arms]] of [[Saudi Arabia]]]]
{{Details|Palm branch (symbol)}}
Dates are mentioned more than 50 times in the [[Bible]] and 20 times in the [[Qur'an]]. In [[Islam]]ic culture, dates and yogurt or milk are traditionally the first foods consumed for [[Iftar]] after the sun has set during [[Ramadan]].

The date palm represents the provincial tree of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)]] (unofficial).

===Symbolism===
{{See also|Plants in Islam}}

In the [[Quran]], [[Allah]] instructs ''Maryām'' (the Virgin Mary) to eat dates when she gives birth to Isa (Jesus);&lt;ref&gt;The Quran, [http://quran.al-islam.com/Page.aspx?pageid=221&amp;BookID=15&amp;Page=306 Chapter 19 - verses 22-25], retrieved on Feb. 28 2015, ''So she [Virgin Mary] conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. she cried (in her anguish): 'Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight!' But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): 'Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee; And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree; it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee.' ''&lt;/ref&gt; and, similarly, they are recommended to pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;[[IslamQA.info|Islam Q &amp; A]], [http://islamqa.info/en/214222 question # 214222: Does Islam recommend any particular foods to maintain a woman’s good health during pregnancy?], retrieved on Feb. 28 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

''Phoenix dactylifera'' held great significance in early [[Judaism]] and subsequently in [[Christianity]], in part because the tree was heavily cultivated as a food source in ancient [[Israel (region)|Israel]].&lt;ref name="James Hastings 1909"&gt;{{cite book| title=Dictionary of the Bible| author=James Hastings| year=1909| p=675}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Bible palm trees are referenced as symbols of prosperity and triumph.&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 92.12&lt;/ref&gt; In Psalm 92:12 "The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree". Palm branches occurred as iconography in sculpture ornamenting the [[Second Jewish Temple]] in Jerusalem, on Jewish coins, and in the sculpture of synagogues. They are also used as ornamentation in the [[Feast of the Tabernacles]].&lt;ref name="James Hastings 1909"/&gt; Palm branches were scattered before Jesus as he entered Jerusalem on [[Palm Sunday]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3238">'''Demand-based switching (DBS)''' is a [[computer technology]] term which refers to the process of using software to optimize the use of hardware resources.

[[Intel]] uses demand-based switching  power management technology to control power voltage consumption at different states of a computer's operations.  DBS routines select a minimum [[clock speed]] of the microprocessor appropriate to the workload which specific tasks being performed by the computer place on the processor.  This results in less electricity being consumed, both by the processor and by fans counteracting excess heat output.  

Intel's processor technology  takes advantage of DBS techniques.&lt;ref name="Rahman2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rezaur Rahman|title=Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor Architecture and Tools: The Guide for Application Developers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZ-9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92|date=3 September 2013|publisher=Apress|isbn=1-4302-5927-2|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scaramella, Jed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7287">Since being founded in 1975, the '''European Nuclear Society''' (ENS) has grown to become the largest society in [[Europe]] for science, engineering and research in support of the [[nuclear industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euronuclear.org/1-about/organisation.htm|title=About ENS|last=Society|first=Author: Marion Brünglinghaus, ENS, European Nuclear|website=www.euronuclear.org|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ENS’s membership consists of national nuclear societies from 22 European countries, plus [[Israel]]. Within the membership there are also stakeholder representatives for nuclear technology and research businesses, with around 60 corporate members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ENS|url=http://www.euronuclear.org/1-about/organisation.htm|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
ENS exists to promote the advancement of peaceful uses of nuclear energy on an international level, encouraging networking between countries and facilitating meetings to support global communication on scientific and technical affairs. ENS also supports education and training in engineering, promotes international standardisation in the nuclear industry, coordinates the activities of the member organisations and develops the expertise and capability needed for the future of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aims|url=http://www.euronuclear.org/1-about/aims.htm|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One of ENS’s activities is organising conferences and workshops, providing a platform for international forums to exchange knowledge, experience, ideas and scientific developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Events|url=http://www.euronuclear.org/1-networking/ensevents.htm|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current president of the European Nuclear Society is [[Noël Camarcat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board Members|url=http://www.euronuclear.org/1-about/whoiswho.htm|accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ENS is member of the [[International Nuclear Societies Council]] (INSC).

==ENS Young Generation Network (YGN)==
The ENS [[Young Generation Network]] (YGN) has been active across the society’s member countries since 1995 when ENS supported a proposal from [[Jan Runermark]], the then President-elect of ENS, to spread the Young Generation Network (YGN) to all its member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YGN|url=http://www.euronuclear.org/ygn/index.htm|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five objectives ensure that YGN members are working towards a common goal, these are:
*Attracting more young people: Recruiting and educating young people to be skilled members of the nuclear industry
*Training new leaders: Exchanging knowledge between generations
*Thinking nationally: Participation of young people in the national nuclear societies
*Thinking internationally: Bringing together all national YGNs at European level
*Opening up nuclear conferences: Ensuring events are relevant and topical for young people to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ENS Young Generation Network|url=http://www.euronuclear.org/ygn/index.htm|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ENS YGN Supporting new nuclear projects|url=http://www.cnr-cme.ro/foren2012/PPT/RTF%203/Andrei%20Goicea.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YGN membership is available to anybody working in the nuclear industry, as well as fields of nuclear academia and research.

==European Nuclear Young Generation Forum (ENYGF)==
The European Nuclear Young Generation Forum (ENYGF) is a biennial international event, held since 2005 by the Young Generation Network (YGN) as part of the European Nuclear Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NI Getting Involved|url=http://www.ygn.nuclearinst.com/Docs/6.%20Getting%20involved.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The forum alternates with the [[International Youth Nuclear Congress]] (IYNC) and is held in a different location in Europe each time.

The aim of the event is to provide a platform for learning and networking for young professionals in all areas of nuclear application. It provides a chance to enhance international communication as well as sharing technical advances and knowledge, learning from experience and discussing best practice as well as considering social and political aspects of the nuclear industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NI Getting Involved|url=http://www.ygn.nuclearinst.com/Docs/6.%20Getting%20involved.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forum involves:
*Formal lectures and presentations
*Workshops - which have previously included Women in Nuclear (WiN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Nuclear|url=http://www.win-europe.org/news/145-workshop|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Technical tours
*Keynote speakers 
*Social and cultural events

Each forum has a number of central focuses, around which the speakers, lectures, presentations and workshops are based. In 2011, the forum in [[Prague]] focused on the topics of nuclear safety and severe accidents, education and training, new build projects and ITER and fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ENGYF 2011|url=http://www.euronuclear.org/e-news/e-news-33/ENYGF-2011-print.htm|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the 2015 forum in [[Paris]] the main focus points were nuclear efficiency and nuclear and the environment.

==Previous ENYGF events==

Following the success of IYNC conferences which began in the year 2000, the ENS-YGN decided to create the ENYGF 2005 and host the inaugural event in the city [[Zagreb]], Croatia. Following this, the ENS-YGN elected cities to host the event every two years, the host locations to date have been:

Bush and Secretary of Energy Sam Bodman listen to [[DaimlerChrysler]]´s Mark Chernoby  describing the [[FedEx]] Pilot Program [[Plug-in hybrid|Plug-in Hybrid]] [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter|Sprinter]] during visit to the [[U.S. Postal Service]]]]

'''The FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies (FCVT)''' is a U.S. national [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]] program developing more [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] and [[green vehicle|environmentally friendly highway transportation technologies]] that will enable the U.S to use less petroleum. It is currently run by Michael Berube. The long-term aim is to develop "[[leap frog]]" technologies that will provide Americans with greater freedom of mobility and [[energy security]], while lowering costs and reducing impacts on the environment.

== FCVT Office ==
The Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies (FCVT) is in the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DoE).

== Clean Cities Program ==
The Clean Cities Program is part of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's FreedomCAR &amp; Vehicle Technologies Program.

The mission of Clean Cities is to advance the nation's economic, environmental, and energy security by supporting local decisions to adopt practices that contribute to the reduction of petroleum consumption. Clean Cities carries out this mission through a network of more than 80 volunteer coalitions, which develop public and private partnerships to promote alternative fuels and vehicles, fuel blends, fuel economy, [[hybrid vehicle]]s, and [[idle reduction]].

== Partnerships==
The goal of the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership is the development of emission- and [[petroleum-free]] cars and [[light truck]]s. The Partnership focuses on the high-risk research needed to develop the necessary technologies, such as [[fuel cell]]s and advanced [[hybrid propulsion]] systems, to provide a full range of affordable cars and light trucks that are free of foreign oil and harmful emissions — and that do not sacrifice [[freedom of mobility]] and freedom of vehicle choice.

To address the research and development needs of commercial vehicles, the goal of the 21st Century Truck Partnership is for USA trucks and buses to safely and cost-effectively move larger volumes of freight and greater numbers of passengers while emitting little or no pollution, with dramatic reduction in dependence on imported petroleum.

== FreedomCAR and plug-in hybrids ==
{{Main|Plug-in hybrid}}

In 2007 DoE announced that it will invest nearly $20 million in plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) research. PHEVs have the potential to displace a large amount of gasoline by delivering up to 40 miles of electric range without recharging—a distance that includes most daily roundtrip [[commuting|commutes]]. Five projects will be cost-shared with the [[United States Advanced Battery Consortium]] (USABC), allowing up to $38 million for battery research and development. The  five [[lithium ion]] battery companies selected for the projects include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy.gov/news/4926.htm Department of Energy - DOE to Provide up to $14 Million to Develop Advanced Batteries for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[A123Systems]] of [[Watertown, Massachusetts]]; [[Compact Power]] Inc. in Michigan, selected for an award of up to $6.25 million from DOE (total DOE/industry cost share: $12.5 million) over three years for a project to develop batteries based on nanophase iron-[[phosphate]] chemistry for 10- and 40-mile range PHEVs; 
* [[Compact Power]] Inc. of [[Troy, Michigan]], selected for an award of up to $4.45 million from DOE (total DOE/industry cost share: $12.7 million) over three years to develop batteries for 10-mile range PHEVs using high energy and high power Manganese-[[spinel]];
* [[3M]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], selected for an award of up to $1.14 million from DOE (total DOE/industry cost share: $ 2.28 million) over two years to screen [[nickel/manganese/cobalt]] (NMC) cathode materials through building and testing of small-sized cells; 
* and [[Johnson Controls]] – Saft Advanced Power Solutions of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, selected for an award of up to $4.1 million from DOE (total DOE/industry cost-share: $8.2 million) over two years to develop batteries using a [[nickelate]]/layered chemistry for 10- and 40-mile range PHEVs.

The projects will focus on developing batteries and cells for 10- and 40-mile range PHEVs and building small cells to test new cathode materials.

In addition, the [[University of Michigan]] will receive nearly $2 million to explore the future of PHEVs in a two-year study conducted with DOE's [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL), [[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], and [[DTE Energy]]. The study will evaluate how PHEVs would share the power grid with other energy needs; monitor the American public's view of PHEVs and their driving behavior in such vehicles; assess the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; and identify how automakers can optimize PHEV design to increase performance and reduce cost. See the DOE press release, the PNNL press Release, and the Draft Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle R&amp;D Plan on the FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Program Web site.

A number of other efforts are also aiming to advance PHEV technologies. In early September, Google.org—the philanthropic arm of Google Inc.—offered $10 million to for-profit companies that are working to advance PHEV technologies. Meanwhile, California's [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG&amp;E) announced that it is working with [[Tesla Motors]] to study the remote control of the charging of electric vehicles. Such "smart charging" could allow a utility to vary the electric [[Load profile|charging load]] on its system in response to intermittent energy sources. In effect, electric vehicles would serve as a large energy storage system that utilities could direct energy to at times when ample supplies are available and the load on the electrical grid is low.

Also DoE and China's Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) signed a five-year agreement in September 2007 to support the large-scale deployment of electric and hybrid-electric vehicles in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy.gov/news/5518.htm Department of Energy - U.S. and China Continue to Increase Cooperation on Vehicle Efficiency&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

With the hydrogen-focused FCVT, whose goal is decades away, the Bush Administration was criticized for ignoring any intermediate-term solutions, while funding it largely with monies redirected from other renewable-energy and energy-efficiency programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grist.org/news/powers/2003/02/26/tough/ What can we learn from Bush’s FreedomCar Plan?] by Amanda Griscom Little at [http://www.grist.org Grist.org], 2003-02-26, retrieved 2009-05-13&lt;/ref&gt; As Ashok Gupta, the lead energy economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, put it, "The FreedomCAR is really about Bush's freedom to do nothing about cars today."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reduction in 2010 funding ==
The Department of Energy's congressional budget request for 2010 budget cuts funding for fuel cell technologies by 60% to US$70 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfo.doe.gov/budget/10budget/Content/Highlights/FY2010Highlights.pdf DOE Budget highlights] (PDF), May 2009, retrieved 2009-05-13&lt;/ref&gt;  Secretary of Energy [[Steven Chu]]'s presentation portrays this as "moving away from funding vehicular hydrogen fuel cells to technologies with more immediate promise."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy.gov/media/Secretary_Chu_2010_Budget_rollout_presentation.pdf Secretary Chu's DOE budget presentation] (PDF) slide 7, 2009-05-07, retrieved 2009-05-13&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="903">A '''garce''' is an obsolete [[unit of measurement]]. 

In [[India]], a garce was a unit of [[dry measure|dry volume]] approximately equal to 5,244&amp;nbsp;litres (149&amp;nbsp;US bushels). In [[Sri Lanka]], it was approximately 5,084.8&amp;nbsp;litres  (144.29447&amp;nbsp;US bushels). 

A garce was also a unit of mass in Sri Lanka approximately equal to 4,198.518&amp;nbsp;kg (4198.518&amp;nbsp;lb). After [[metrication]] by both countries in the mid-20th century, the unit became obsolete.

They let [[three-phase]] ([[Y-Δ transform|delta connected]]) systems accommodate phase-to-neutral loads by providing a return path for current to a neutral. 

Grounding transformers are typically used to:

* Provide a relatively low-impedance path to ground, thereby maintaining the system neutral at or near ground potential.
* Limit the magnitude of transient overvoltages when restriking ground faults occur.
* Provide a source of ground fault current during line-to-ground faults.
* Permit the connection of phase-to-neutral loads when desired.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The grounding point of the transformer may be connected through a resistor to limit the fault current on the system in the event of a line-to-ground fault. &lt;ref&gt;Martin Heathcote (ed.), ''J &amp; P Transformer Book'', Newnes, 2011 {{ISBN|0080551785}}pp. 421-422 &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gottelborn Solar Park''' ({{lang-de|Solarpark Zeche Göttelborn}}) is a 8.4-[[Megawatt|MW]]&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; [[photovoltaic power station]] located in [[Göttelborn]], in [[Quierschied]] municipality, Germany. The power plant was constructed by [[City Solar]] in two stages. The first stage was completed in August, 2004, followed by the second stage three years later in November 2007.&lt;ref name="pvresources"&gt;[http://www.pvresources.com/en/top50pv.php World's largest photovoltaic systems] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212195222/http://www.pvresources.com/en/top50pv.php |date=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''&lt;span lang="ar" dir="rtl"&gt;Hall&lt;/span&gt; effect sensor''' is a [[transducer]] that varies its output [[voltage]] in response to a [[magnetic field]]. [[Hall effect]] sensors are used for [[Distance|proximity]] switching, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications.&lt;ref name="ramsden"&gt;{{cite book |title= Hall-effect sensors: theory and applications |first= Edward |last=Ramsden |edition= 2, illustrated |publisher= [[Elsevier]] |year= 2006 |isbn= 0-7506-7934-4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=R8VAjMitH1QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Hall effect sensor, a thin strip of metal has a current applied along it. In the presence of a magnetic field, the electrons in the metal strip are deflected toward one edge, producing a voltage gradient across the short side of the strip (perpendicular to the feed current). Hall effect sensors have an advantage over [[Inductive sensor|inductive sensors]] in that, while inductive sensors respond to a changing magnetic field which induces current in a coil of wire and produces voltage at its output, Hall effect sensors can detect static (non-changing) magnetic fields.

In its simplest form, the sensor operates as an [[analog (signal)|analog]] transducer, directly returning a voltage. With a known magnetic field, its distance from the Hall plate can be determined. Using groups of sensors, the relative position of the magnet can be deduced.

Frequently, a Hall sensor is combined with threshold detection so that it acts as and is called a [[switch]]. Commonly seen in industrial applications such as the pictured [[pneumatic cylinder]], they are also used in consumer equipment; for example some [[computer printer]]s use them to detect missing paper and open covers. They can also be used in [[Keyboard technology#Hall-effect keyboard|computer keyboards]], an application that requires ultra-high reliability.

Hall sensors are commonly used to time the speed of wheels and shafts, such as for [[internal combustion engine]] [[Ignition system|ignition]] [[ignition timing|timing]], [[tachometer]]s and [[anti-lock braking system]]s. They are used in [[brushless DC electric motor]]s to detect the position of the permanent magnet. In the pictured wheel with two equally spaced magnets, the voltage from the sensor will peak twice for each revolution. This arrangement is commonly used to regulate the speed of [[Disk storage|disk]] drives.

==Hall probe==
A Hall probe contains an [[indium]] compound [[semiconductor]] crystal such as [[Indium antimonide#Device applications|indium antimonide]], mounted on an [[aluminum]] backing plate, and encapsulated in the probe head. The plane of the crystal is perpendicular to the probe handle. Connecting leads from the crystal are brought down through the handle to the circuit box.

When the Hall probe is held so that the magnetic field lines are passing at right angles through the sensor of the probe, the meter gives a reading of the value of magnetic flux density (B). A current is passed through the crystal which, when placed in a magnetic field has a "[[Hall effect]]" voltage developed across it. The Hall effect is seen when a conductor is passed through a uniform magnetic field. The natural electron drift of the charge carriers causes the magnetic field to apply a [[Lorentz force]] (the force exerted on a charged particle in an electromagnetic field) to these charge carriers. The result is what is seen as a charge separation, with a buildup of either positive or negative charges on the bottom or on the top of the plate. The crystal measures 5&amp;nbsp;mm square. The probe handle, being made of a non-[[ferrous]] material, has no disturbing effect on the field.

A Hall probe should be calibrated against a known value of magnetic field strength. For a [[solenoid]] the Hall probe is placed in the center.

==Working principle==
When a beam of charged particles passes through a magnetic field, forces act on the particles and the beam is deflected from a straight path. The flow of electrons through a conductor form a beam of charged carriers. When a conductor is placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the electrons, they will be deflected from a straight path. As a consequence, one plane of the conductor will become negatively charged and the opposite side will become positively charged. The voltage between these planes is called the Hall voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Hall effect devices |first= R. S.|last=Popović |edition= 2, illustrated |publisher= [[CRC Press]] |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-7503-0855-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_H5n-5sO5BAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=hall+effect+sensor#v=onepage&amp;q=hall%20effect%20sensor&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the force on the charged particles from the electric field balances the force produced by magnetic field, the separation of them will stop. If the current is not changing, then the Hall voltage is a measure of the magnetic flux density. Basically, there are two kinds of Hall effect sensors. One is linear which means the output of voltage linearly depends on magnetic flux density; the other is called threshold which means there will be a sharp decrease of output voltage at each magnetic flux density.

== Materials ==
The key factor determining sensitivity of Hall effect sensors is high [[electron mobility]]. As a result, the following materials are especially suitable for Hall effect sensors:
* [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs)
* [[indium arsenide]] (InAs)
* [[indium phosphide]] (InP)
* [[indium antimonide]] (InSb)
* [[graphene]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Oleg|last=Petruk||first2=Roman|last2=Szewczyk|first3=Tymoteusz|last3=Ciuk|first4=Włodzimierz|last4=Strupiński|first5=Jacek|last5=Salach|first6=Michał|last6=Nowicki|first7=Iwona|last7=Pasternak|first8=Wojciech|last8=Winiarski|first9=Krzysztof|last9=Trzcinka |date=2014 |title=Sensitivity and Offset Voltage Testing in the Hall-Effect Sensors Made of Graphene |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-05353-0_60 |journal=Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing |publisher=Springer |volume=267 |issue= |pages=631 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-05353-0_60 |accessdate=|displayauthors=3 |series=Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing |isbn=978-3-319-05352-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signal processing and interface==
Hall effect sensors are linear transducers. As a result, such sensors require a linear circuit for processing of the sensor's output signal. Such a linear circuit:
* provides a constant driving current to the sensors
* amplifies the output signal

In some cases the linear circuit may cancel the offset voltage of Hall effect sensors. Moreover, AC modulation of the driving current may also reduce the influence of this offset voltage.

Hall effect sensors with linear transducers are commonly integrated with digital electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall Effect Sensor Voltage Regulation and Power Management|url=http://phareselectronics.com/products/hall-effect-sensors/voltage-regulation-and-power-management/|website=phareselectronics.com|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables advanced corrections to the sensor's characteristics (e.g. temperature coefficient corrections) and digital interfacing to microprocessor systems. In some solutions of [[Integrated circuit|IC]] Hall effect sensors a [[digital signal processing|DSP]] is used, which provides for more choices among processing techniques.&lt;ref name="ramsden"/&gt;{{rp|167}}

The Hall effect sensor interfaces may include input diagnostics, fault protection for transient conditions, and short/open circuit detection. It may also provide and monitor the current to the Hall effect sensor itself. There are precision [[Integrated circuit|IC]] products available to handle these features.

== Advantages ==
A Hall effect sensor may operate as an electronic switch.
* Such a switch costs less than a [[Reed switch|mechanical switch]] and is much more reliable.
* It can be operated at higher frequencies than a mechanical switch.
* It does not suffer from contact bounce because a solid state switch with hysteresis is used rather than a mechanical contact.
* It will not be affected by environmental contaminants since the sensor is in a sealed package. Therefore, it can be used under severe conditions.

In the case of linear sensor (for the magnetic field strength measurements), a Hall effect sensor:
* can measure a wide range of magnetic fields
* is available that can measure either North or South pole magnetic fields
* can be flat

== Disadvantages ==
Hall effect sensors provide much lower measuring accuracy than [[fluxgate magnetometer]]s or [[magnetoresistance]]-based sensors. Moreover, Hall effect sensors drift significantly, requiring compensation.

== Applications ==

=== Position sensing ===
Sensing the presence of magnetic objects (connected with the position sensing) is the most common industrial application of Hall effect sensors, especially those operating in the switch mode (on/off mode). The Hall effect sensors are also used in the [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motor]] to sense the position of the rotor and to switch the transistors in the right sequence.

Smartphones use hall sensors to determine if the Flip Cover accessory is closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asus.com/Phone/ZenFone_5_A500CG/specifications/|title=ZenFone 5 (A500CG)|website=asus.com|access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Samsung Galaxy S4|Galaxy S4 Accessories]].

=== Direct current (DC) transformers ===
Hall effect sensors may be utilized for contactless measurements of [[DC current]] in [[current transformer]]s. In such a case the Hall effect sensor is mounted in the gap in magnetic core around the current conductor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petruk |first=O. |last2=Szewczyk |first2=R. |last3=Salach |first3=J. |last4=Nowicki |first4=M. |date=2014 |title=Digitally Controlled Current Transformer with Hall Sensor |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-05353-0_61 |journal=Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing |publisher=Springer |volume=267 |issue= |pages=641 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-05353-0_61 |accessdate=|series=Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing |isbn=978-3-319-05352-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the DC [[magnetic flux]] can be measured, and the DC current in the conductor can be calculated.

=== Automotive fuel level indicator ===
The Hall sensor is used in some automotive fuel level indicators. The main principle of operation of such indicator is position sensing of a floating element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liquid Level Sensing: Measuring Liquid Levels Using Hall Effect Sensors |url=https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/AppNote_Liquid_Level_Sensing_Rev.1.0.pdf?folderId=db3a30431ce5fb52011d4cae1f582dad&amp;fileId=db3a30432313ff5e0123a385f3b2262d|date=12 February 2009|accessdate=2 September 2017|website=infineon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can either be done by using a vertical float magnet or a rotating lever sensor. 
* In a vertical float system a permanent magnet is mounted on the surface of a floating object. The current carrying conductor is fixed on the top of the tank lining up with the magnet. When the level of fuel rises, an increasing magnetic field is applied on the current resulting in higher Hall voltage. As the fuel level decreases, the Hall voltage will also decrease. The fuel level is indicated and displayed by proper signal condition of Hall voltage. 
* In a rotating lever sensor a diametrically magnetized ring magnet rotates about a linear hall sensor. The sensor only measures the perpendicular (vertical) component of the field. The strength of the field measured correlates directly to the angle of the lever and thus the level of the fuel tank.

=== Keyboard switch ===
{{pov-section|date=December 2017}}
Developed by Everett A. Vorthmann and Joeseph T. Maupin for Micro Switch (a division of Honeywell) in 1969, the switch was known to still be in production until as late as 1990.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}The key-switches have been tested to have a lifetime of over 30 billion keypresses,{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} and also has dual open-collector outputs for reliability. The Honeywell Hall effect switch is most famously used in the [[Space-cadet keyboard]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} a keyboard used on LISP machines.

The '''Household Electricity Approach''' to measuring the size of the [[underground economy]] or [[black market]] of a country exploits the presumed relationship between household electrical consumption and a country's GDP. It assumes that undeclared economic activity still needs to use resources, such as electricity, to function. Since electricity consumption is generally well known it can be used as an indicator of economic activity that is not otherwise declared.
 
The household electricity approach was developed by [[Maria Lacko]] as a method to determine the size of the [[hidden economy]] in a country. Lacko’s primary focus within this approach was directed at the relationship between the household electrical consumption and [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) of a country using regression analysis. Her research in this area was particularly focused on developing methodologies that would help to more accurately determine the prevalence of the [[hidden economy]] in transitional countries such as the former [[Soviet bloc]] countries.

==History==
Lacko’s work received its basis from two other works. The first of these works, developed in 1995, is the method of Dobozi and Pohl. These researchers had suggested that aggregate economic activity and electrical power consumption were closely related (Lacko 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;347). In fact, from their observations, electrical consumption and GDP elasticity were close to a one-to-one ratio (Lacko 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;143). This was true in the case of countries under a market economy; however, it did not appear to be the case for former Soviet bloc countries.

The works of Daniel Kaufman and Aleksandr Kaliberda followed a similar path as Istvan Dobozi and Gerhard Pohl's work. Kaufman and Kaliberda developed a method that considered the growth rate of the formal market's GDP and the growth of electrical consumption (Lacko 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;123). It was evident, as noted by Dobozi and Pohl, that change within the GDP resulted in lockstep changes with electrical consumption for market economies; however, Kaufman and Kaliberda also noted that the former Soviet bloc countries did not seem to maintain this consistency. The researchers suggested that the transitional nature of these countries' economic development created a break in the consistency between GDP and electrical consumption (Lacko 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;350).  Kaufman and Kaliberda adapted their approach to allow for the calculation of this inconsistency between electrical activity and GDP.

Lacko disagreed with the previous methods use of aggregate electrical consumption as the primary source of calculations to determine the extent of the hidden economy (Lacko 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;164). Additionally, Lacko expressed concerns with the assumption of a constant electrical intensification (Lacko 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;164). The household electricity approach was developed as an alternative (Lacko 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;142–143).

==General Concepts==
{{Disputed section|date=June 2013}}
The household electricity approach follows the general idea that electrical consumption and GDP can help to estimate the size of a country's hidden market; however, the household electricity approach makes several diversions from the previous works for enhanced utility, particularly for transitional countries. The first of these was the decision to limit the concept of the informal market. Lacko limits the informal market to non-registered activities that consume household electricity. This excludes hidden activities such as bribes and many illegal activities (Lacko 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;132). By doing this, Lacko limited the magnitude of the data collecting process. Lacko also chose not to measure national electrical consumption; instead, the effort was centered on household electrical consumption (Lacko 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;361). This, in particular, would capture businesses within the informal market that were operating from a homestead. These businesses have been considered to be a traditional and rather large component of the informal economies of Eastern Europe. Additionally, Lacko presumed that household electrical consumption would not be as dramatically affected by structural changes caused by transitional experiences such as those of the former Soviet bloc countries.

Lacko’s method begins with the basic premise that each household’s electrical consumption should be associated with a portion of the informal market (Lacko 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;161).This is determined by using time-series cross sections of each country. Within this method there are three proxy variables to be studied: tax/GDP ratio, the inactive/active labor ratio and the ratio of public social welfare expenditures (Lacko 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;362). For Lacko’s original study the parameters were focused around estimates of cross-sections from nineteen [[OECD]] countries in 1990, nineteen OECD countries in 1989 and panel data for 1989-1990(Lacko 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;362). The final determinization was completed by subtracting residential electrical consumption from the actual amount of electrical consumption (Lacko 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;362).

==Formula==
      1nE + I = α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;1nC&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + α&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + αH&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + α&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) + β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
           β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;0 β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;0           β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;0

where:

:''i'' : the number assigned to the country
:E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; : ''per capita'' household electricity consumption in country i in Mtoe
:C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; : ''per capita'' real consumption of households without the consumption of electricity in country i in US dollars( purchasing parity)
:PR&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; : the real price of consumption of 1kwh of residential electricity in US dollars(at purchasing parity)
:G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; : the relative frequency of months with the need of heating in houses in country i
:Qi : the ratio of energy sources other than electric energy to all energy sources in household energy consumption
:H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; : the per capita output of the hidden economy
:T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; : the ratio of the sum of paid personal income, corporate profit and taxes on goods and services to GDP
:S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; :  the ratio of public social welfare expenditures to GDP
:D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; : the sum of number of dependants over 14 years and of inactive earners, both per 100 active earners
::(Lacko 1998, p. 133)
After the total electricity consumption of households has been determined, the next step is to proceed to find the informal economy’s contribution to the GDP of a country (Lacko 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;140). To create this index, Lacko had to determine a way to calculate how much GDP is produced by one unit of electricity (Lacko 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;140). This was done by taking known estimations of a market economy and making comparisons with this to another approach (Lacko 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;140).

==Advantages==
The household electricity approach does not require predetermined weights as had been established in previous approaches utilizing electrical consumption to determine the extent of the hidden economy (Lacko 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;149). Instead the weights of the different causes can be determined during the estimation. By the use of residential electrical consumption, Lacko's approach allows for an accurate measure of market economies as well as transitional economies approaches utilizing electrical consumption to determine the extent of the hidden economy.

==Disadvantages==
A disadvantage of the household electricity approach is that it is limited in its scope of study. The range of the study can only include those parts of the hidden economy that utilize household electricity (Lacko 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;150).

==Criticisms==
The primary criticism for the household electricity approach, as well as other electrical consumption approaches, centers around the assumptions made regarding the stability of the consistency of electrical consumption with GDP. Critics suggest that levels of stability can be altered significantly by the omission of such basic factors as shifts in the weather (Hanousek and Palda 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;14). The authors of electrical consumption approaches have admittedly been aware of the weakness of their assumptions and have made attempts to control for factors that would make electrical consumption inconsistent with GDP; however, critics do not see these attempts as being adequate enough (Hanousek and Palda 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;709).

== Plot ==
''Katiyabaaz'' is a story of [[Kanpur]]'s [[electricity crisis]], resulting in [[loadshedding]]. Power cuts of up to 15 hours a day, cause great trouble to residents and factories alike. This gap in supply and demand becomes the bedrock of local electricity thieves like Loha Singh, who provide illegal power connection to people, by plugging into official supply through live wires. However such free connection causes heavy financial losses to the power supply company, whose MD struggles to fight the menace of power theft, and local fixers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Film review: ''Katiyabaaz'' |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/film-review-katiyabaaz/ |publisher= The Indian Express |author=Shubhra Gupta |date= 22 August 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film follows Loha Singh, an electricity thief, and Ritu Maheshwari an official with [[Kanpur Electricity Supply Company]].

==Production==
The film was made on a small budget of {{INR Convert|1|c}} and had music by fusion rock band [[Indian Ocean (band)|Indian Ocean]] who composed and sang the song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CgZF_hSTVQ Kanpoora] for the film.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt; The film was shot over a period of nearly two years, with a crew of 10-12 people. Instead of staying at hotels, the crew rented a bungalow and furnished it, which was economical.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

The film's co-director, Fahad Mustafa, originally from Kanpur, researched the subject for six months before he started filming. However, they came across Loha Singh, the "''katiyabaaz''" (electricity thief) around whom the film is based, only after the shooting had already started, and another ''katiyabaaz'' had backed out in the last moment. Loha Singh, himself was initially apprehensive about allowing himself be filmed, as he thought it to be a [[sting operation]] on his work or the crew to be of the ''[[Dabangg]]'' film series. The rumour about the latter, drew large crowds to filming locations, hampering production. The fact that some of the crew were foreigners also created much curiosity. Gradually Loha Singh and the locals became comfortable with the film crew. The crew shot candid conversations, several individual stories and the crippling effects of electricity crisis in the area on the common man, local industries as well as small business owners.&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Katiyabaaz'': Filmmakers talk about documenting Kanpur's battle for electricity | url = http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/katiyabaaz-filmmakers-talk-about-documenting-kanpurs-battle-for-electricity-1179769.html |author= Deepanjana Pal |date=28 August 2014 | accessdate = 2014-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Thought I will end up in jail for 'Katiyabaaz': Loha Singh |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Thought-I-will-end-up-in-jail-for-Katiyabaaz-Loha-Singh/articleshow/41176059.cms |date=29 August 2014 |accessdate = 2014-08-30 |work=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kori Nuclear Power Plant''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 고리원자력발전소, [[Hanja]]: 古里原子力發電所) is a [[South Korea]]n [[nuclear power]] plant located in Kori, a suburban village in [[Busan]].  It is owned and operated by [[Korea Hydro &amp; Nuclear Power]], a subsidiary of [[Korea Electric Power|KEPCO]]. The first reactor began commercial operation in 1978.

An expansion of the plant begun in 2006 added four new Korean-sourced reactors, the so-called Shin Kori reactors. The first pair of Shin Kori reactors are of the [[OPR-1000]] design, while the second two are the [[APR-1400]] design. By November 2010 the first was online and the rest undergoing trials or construction. {{Asof|December 2016}} approval of operation of reactor 4 is expected in the first half of 2017.&lt;ref name=wnn-20161220/&gt; Two further APR-1400 reactors, known as Shin Kori 5 and Shin Kori 6 have started construction in April 2017 and  September 2018, respectively. &lt;ref&gt; https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/CountryStatistics/ReactorDetails.aspx?current=1074&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/CountryStatistics/ReactorDetails.aspx?current=1075&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactors==
{{Asof|February 2017}} all reactors on site are [[pressurized water reactor]]s.

Kori 1 was shutdown in June 2017 in advance of decommissioning beginning in 2022 after its [[spent nuclear fuel]] is removed.&lt;ref name=nei-20170612&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newskorea-to-decommission-its-oldest-reactor-5840900 |title=Korea to decommission its oldest reactor |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=12 June 2017 |accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==

On February 9, 2012, during a refueling outage, loss of off-site power (LOOP) occurred and emergency diesel generator (EDG) 'B' failed to start while EDG 'A' was out of service for scheduled maintenance, resulting in a station blackout (SBO). Off-site power was restored 12 minutes after the SBO condition began. 
The LOOP was caused by a human error during a protective relay test of the main generator. The EDG 'B' failing to start was caused by the failure of the EDG air start system. Further investigation revealed that the utility did not exercise proper control of electrical distribution configuration to ensure the availability of the Station Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) while conducting test on the Unit Auxiliary Transformer (UAT).
After restoring off-site power through the SAT, the operators eventually recovered shutdown cooling by restoring power to a residual heat removal pump. During the loss of shutdown cooling for 19 minutes, the reactor coolant maximum temperature in the hot leg increased from 37℃ to 58.3℃ (approximately 21.3℃ rise), and the spent fuel pool temperature slightly increased from 21℃ to 21.5℃.
There was no adverse effect on the plant safety as a result of this event, no radiation exposure to the workers, and no release of radioactive materials to the environment. However, inconsistent with the requirements, the licensee did not report the SBO event to the regulatory body in a timely manner and did not declare the "alert" status of the event in accordance with the plant emergency plan. The licensee reported this event to the regulatory body about a month after the event had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-news.iaea.org/ErfView.aspx?mId=c4d6b9a1-1f60-4bf3-b333-bb5485fa55e9 |title=Loss of shutdown cooling due to station blackout during refueling outage |publisher=IAEA |date=23 April 2012 |accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malvalic acid''' is a [[cyclopropene fatty acid]] found in  [[baobab]] seed oil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://acnfp.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/mnt/drupal_data/sources/files/multimedia/pdfs/baobabapplicationfinal.pdf |title= Baobab Dried Fruit Pulp – An application for Novel Foods Approval in the EU as a food ingredient. Section 8.4 Cyclopropene Fatty Acids |pages= 30–32 |authorlink= John Wilkinson (chemist) |first= John |last= Wilkinson |year= 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cottonseed oil]]. The [[cyclopropene]] ring is thought to be one of the causes of abnormalities that develop in animals that ingest cottonseed oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hornback|first=Joseph|title=Organic Chemistry, Second Edition|year=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0534389512|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refining processes, such as [[hydrogenation]], oil can remove or destroy malvalic acid.

==Biosynthesis==
The [[biosynthesis]] of malvalic acid starts with [[oleic acid]], an 18-carbon [[monounsaturated fatty acid]], leading to [[sterculic acid]]. An [[alpha oxidation|α-oxidation]] reaction removes one carbon from the chain to form the 17-carbon-chain structure of malvalic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewick|first=Paul|title=Medicinal Natural products|year=2009|isbn=9780470741689|pages=46–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the co-occurrence of malvalic acid and the corresponding cyclopropane acids in several types of seeds. He suggested that methylene addition to oleic acid gave rise to dihydrosterculic acid, which was desaturated to sterculic acid, and that 8-heptadecenoic acid was similarly the precursor of dihydromalvalic acid and malvalic acid. Smith and Bu'Lock&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0006-291X(64)90025-7| title = Biogenesis of cyclopropene acids| journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications| volume = 17| issue = 4| pages = 433| year = 1964| last1 = Smith | first1 = G.

'''Mattress coils''', also known as '''mattress springs''', are [[coil spring]]s used in a [[mattress]]. Coils are primarily used in the core (support layer) of [[innerspring mattress]]es, which is their original use. In recent years small "micro-coils" have started being used in the [[upholstery]] (comfort layer) of mattresses, primarily with a coil core ("coil-on-coil" construction), but sometimes with other core types.

Mattress coils were introduced in the mid-late 19th century, and remain popular in the 21st century, particularly in the United States.

==Types==
There are four types of mattress coils. A key desiderata is "response range", meaning the change in firmness as the spring is compressed – initially soft, to conform to the body, then hard, to provide support. In increasing order of response range and cost, the types are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mattress support cores - Innersprings|url=https://www.themattressunderground.com/mattresses/support-cores/innersprings.html|publisher=The Mattress Underground|accessdate=21 July 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Auer|first1=Joe|title=Mattress Coils: Considerations When Purchasing a Mattress|url=https://www.mattressclarity.com/blog/mattress-coils/|website=Mattress Clarity|accessdate=20 July 2017|date=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Continuous coils''' (the Leggett &amp; Platt brand name is "Mira-coil") is an innerspring configuration in which the rows of coils are formed from a single piece of wire. They work in a hinging effect similar to that of offset coils.
* '''Bonnell coils''' are the oldest and most common. First adapted from [[Horse and buggy|buggy seat]] springs of the 19th century, they are still prevalent in mid-priced mattresses. Bonnell springs are a knotted, round-top, hourglass-shaped steel wire coil. When laced together with cross wire helicals, these coils form the simplest innerspring unit, also referred to as a Bonnell unit.
* '''Offset coils''' are an hourglass type coil on which portions of the top and bottom convolutions have been flattened. In assembling the innerspring unit, these flat segments of wire are hinged together with helical wires. The hinging effect of the unit is designed to conform to body shape. LFK (Left Facing Knot) coils are an offset coil with a cylindrical or columnar shape.
* '''[[Marshall coil]]s,''' also known as wrapped or encased coils or '''pocket springs''', are thin-gauge, barrel-shaped, knotless coils individually encased in fabric pockets—normally a fabric from man-made, nonwoven fiber. Some manufacturers precompress these coils, which makes the mattress firmer and allows for motion separation between the sides of the bed.  As the springs are not wired together, they work more or less independently: the weight on one spring does not affect its neighbours. More than half the consumers who participated in a survey had chosen to buy pocket spring mattresses.&lt;ref name=which&gt;[http://www.which.co.uk/home-and-garden/home-improvements/guides/choosing-the-best-type-of-mattress/find-the-perfect-bed-mattress/ Which, published by Consumers Association: Mattresses:  Choosing the best type of mattress]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While coil springs were invented in the 15th century, they were not used in mattresses until the mid-late 19th century, following the use of [[upholstery coil springs]] in furniture and carriages.

Microcoils were introduced in the early 21st century, and {{as of|2014|lc=1}} are a small part of the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mattress comfort layers - Microcoils|url=https://www.themattressunderground.com/mattresses/comfort-layers/microcoils.html|publisher=The Mattress Underground|accessdate=20 July 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Upholstery coil springs|bed coil spring]] was patented by Louis Andrew Vargha. Some modern feedback on coils within mattresses cast aspersions on 
some of its attributes such as abrasion on coils eventually culminating into prodding,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Bert H., et al. "Effect of prescribed sleep surfaces on back pain and sleep quality in patients diagnosed with low back and shoulder pain." Applied ergonomics 42.1 (2010): 91-97.&lt;/ref&gt; and the audibility of the coils, as it may decrease privacy for intimate moments such as sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Terrie Heinrich. "Sleep matters: learn smart strategies to make sure your body gets the zzzzzs it needs." IDEA Fitness Journal 4.5 (2007): 102-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturers==
The mattress coil market is quite concentrated – the leading suppliers are [[Leggett &amp;amp; Platt]] (founded 1883) of [[Carthage, Missouri]] {{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and [http://www.hsmsolutions.com/ HSM Solutions] (formally Hickory Springs, founded 1944) of [[Hickory, North Carolina]]; others include [http://www.spinks-springs.com/ Spinks Springs] (founded 1840) of [[Leeds]], [[United Kingdom]] and [http://www.subinas.es/ Subiñas] (founded 1959) of [[Biscay]], [[Spain]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}. Raha mattresses are the leading mattress manufacturers in Gulf region. Cloudnine mattress is the luxury segment of Poly Products-manufacturer of Raha mattresses.

The '''Minister for Energy''' is an [[Australia]]n [[Government of Australia|Government]] [[Government department|Cabinet position]] with the duties of serving the people of Australia by developing a more prosperous and sustainable Australia by leading and coordinating the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of energy efficiency, [[adaptation to climate change]] and shaping of global solutions.

[[The Honourable|The Hon]]. [[Angus Taylor (politician)|Angus Taylor]] [[Australian House of Representatives|MP]] was appointed as Energy Minister by the Governor-General on 28 August 2018.

The position of [[Energy Minister]] previously had responsibility for the [[Department of Climate Change]] and Energy Efficiency under the [[Rudd Government (2007–10)|Rudd]] and [[Gillard Government]]. The precursor department was led by the Secretary, Blair Comley [[Public Service Medal (Australia)|PSM]] who was responsible to the [[Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (Australia)|Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency]], the Honourable [[Greg Combet]] [[Order of Australia|AM]] [[Member of Parliament#Australia|MP]]. The minister was assisted by the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the Honourable [[Mark Dreyfus]] [[Queens Counsel|QC]] MP. The [[Clean Energy Regulator]] was a [[statutory authority]] formed 2 April 2012, which was part of the department.

On 25 March 2013, responsibility for Climate Change passed to the newly formed [[Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education]], and the duties of the [[Ministry of Energy]] passed to the [[Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism]]. After the 7 September 2013 Australian federal election the responsibility for Energy passed to the [[Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science]] under the [[Abbott Government]]. Following the Australia federal election of 2 July 2016, responsibilities were passed to the [[Minister of the Environment (Australia)|Minister of the Environment and Energy]] under the [[Turnbull Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ministers |url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/ministers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the appointment of [[Scott Morrison]] as [[Prime Minister]], [[Josh Frydenberg]] was elevated to [[Treasurer of Australia]], whereby Frydenberg's previous ministerial positions were separated, with [[Melissa Price (politician)|Melissa Price]] as [[Minister of the Environment (Australia)|Minister of the Environment]] and [[Angus Taylor (politician)|Angus Taylor]] as Minister for Energy.

The '''Montalto di Castro nuclear power station''' was a nuclear power plant at [[Montalto di Castro]] in [[Italy]]. Consisting of two [[BWR]] units each of 982 MWe, it was approaching completion in 1988 when the Italian government decided to close all nuclear plants as a result of the [[Italian referendums, 1987|1987 referendum]]. It never operated.

Its area and some of the already built structures are now used by the [[fossil-fuel power station]] "Alessandro Volta", the biggest [[List of power stations in Italy|power station in Italy]].

There are currently 48 '''national parks''' in [[Russia]], a list of which is given below. Together they cover approximately {{convert|155672|km2| sqmi|sp=us}}.

==Overview==
[[File:RussianNationalParksmap.jpg|thumb|right|430px|Map of national parks in Russia]]
The oldest parks in Russia are [[Sochinsky National Park|Sochinsky]] and [[Losiny Ostrov National Park|Losiny Ostrov]] (1983); [[Samarskaya Luka National Park|Samarskaya Luka]] (1984); [[Marii Chodra National Park|Mariy Chodra]] (1985); [[Bashkiriya National Park|Bashkiriya]], [[Prielbrusye National Park|Prielbrusye]], [[Pribaykalsky National Park|Pribaykalsky]], and [[Zabaykalsky National Park|Zabaykalsky]] (1986).&lt;ref&gt;Russian Nature Press&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the law on the [[protected areas of Russia]], national parks are areas of land and water devoted to nature protection, ecological education, and scientific research. They contain sites of particular ecological, historical and aesthetic value. Regulated tourism is permitted.&lt;ref name=law &gt;[http://oopt.info/oopt_statut.html "About Special Protected Nature Areas"], a Russian Federation federal law of March 14, 1995.{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oopt"&gt;Biodiversity Conservation Centre Moscow&lt;/ref&gt;
The area of each park is divided into zones according to various functions. There should be a strictly protected area managed as a [[zapovednik]], and also recreational and buffer zones in which economic activity is allowed, such as tourism, traditional land use, and benign forms of agriculture and forestry. The strictly protected function is sometimes fulfilled by a neighbouring official zapovednik; for instance, [http://oopt.info/barguz/index.html Barguzin Zapovednik] adjoins Zabaykalsky National Park on the east side of [[Lake Baikal]].&lt;ref name="oopt"/&gt;
In 2001 [[Vodlozersky National Park]] received [[UNESCO]] [[Biosphere Reserve]] status, followed by [[Smolenskoye Poozerye National Park|Smolenskoye Poozerye]] and [[Ugra National Park]] in 2002, and two others ([[Valdaysky National Park|Valdaysky]] and [[Kenozersky National Park|Kenozersky]]) in 2004.  The newest park is [[Bikin National Park]], created in late 2015.&lt;ref name="oopt"/&gt;

The national parks are currently the responsibility of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Russia)]].&lt;ref name="oopt"/&gt;

'''Oceanic dispersal''' is a type of [[biological dispersal]] that occurs when terrestrial organisms transfer from one land mass to another by way of a sea crossing.

==History==
Rafting has played an important role in the colonization of isolated land masses by mammals. Prominent examples include [[Madagascar]], which has been isolated for ~120 million years ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), and [[South America]], which was isolated for much of the [[Cenozoic]]. Both land masses, for example, appear to have received their [[primate]]s by this mechanism. According to genetic evidence, the common ancestor of the [[lemur]]s of [[Madagascar]] appears to have crossed the [[Mozambique Channel]] by rafting between 50 and 60 Ma ago.&lt;ref name=Roos&gt;{{cite journal | first = Christian | last = Roos |author2=Schmitz, Jürgen |author3=Zischler, Hans | title = Primate jumping genes elucidate strepsirrhine phylogeny | journal = PNAS | date = July 2004 | volume = 101 | pages = 10650–10654 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/29/10650.full.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0403852101 | pmid = 15249661 | issue = 29 | pmc = 489989 | bibcode=2004PNAS..10110650R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sellers&gt;{{cite web | url = http://homepage.mac.com/wis/Personal/lectures/human-origins/PrimateEvolution.pdf | title = Primate Evolution | accessdate = 2008-10-23 | last = Sellers | first = Bill | date = 2000-10-20 | format = PDF | publisher = [[University of Edinburgh]] | pages = 13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ali&amp;Huber"&gt;{{Cite journal

Colonization of groups of islands can occur by an [[Iteration|iterative]] rafting process sometimes called [[island hopping]]. Such a process appears to have played a role, for example, in the colonization of the [[Caribbean]] by [[Mammals of the Caribbean|mammals of South American origin]] (including caviomorphs and monkeys).&lt;ref name = "Hedges2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3417/0026-6493(2006)93[231:POTAAO]2.0.CO;2| title = Paleogeography of the Antilles and Origin of West Indian Terrestrial Vertebrates1| journal = [[Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden]]| volume = 93| issue = 2| pages = 231–244| year = 2006| last1 = Hedges | first1 = S.

==Observation==
The first documented example of colonization of a land mass by rafting occurred in the aftermath of hurricanes [[Hurricane Luis|Luis]] and [[Hurricane Marilyn|Marilyn]] in the [[Caribbean]] in 1995. A raft of uprooted trees carrying fifteen or more [[green iguana]]s was observed by fishermen landing on the east side of [[Anguilla]] – an island where they had never before been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=E.|date=1998-10-15|title=Iguanas ride the waves|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/news981015-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iguanas had apparently been caught on the trees and rafted two hundred miles across the ocean from [[Guadeloupe]], where they are indigenous.&lt;ref name="Censky1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Censky|first1=E.

The advent of human civilization has created opportunities for organisms to raft on floating artifacts, which may be more durable than natural floating objects.

An '''ogee''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|dʒ|iː}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|dʒ|iː}}) is a [[curve]] (often used in [[molding (decorative)|moulding]]), shaped somewhat like an S, consisting of two [[arc (geometry)|arc]]s that curve in opposite senses, so that the ends are [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]]. It is a kind of [[sigmoid curve]].

The term has uses in [[architecture]], [[mathematics]], and [[fluid mechanics]], as well as marine [[construction]], [[clock design]] and [[plastic surgery]].

Ogee is also written '''O.G.'''.  This long-standing variant may have originated from a mis-hearing of the spoken word ''ogee'' as an abbreviation.  Nevertheless, the quasi-abbreviation is often seen in print within the millwork trade.

==Use in architecture==
===Ogee arch===
[[File:Kilfane Church, 13th Century Door Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny.jpg|thumb|An unorthodox ogee arch in [[Kilfane Church]], Ireland (13th century)]]
In architecture, the principal use of the term is to describe an [[arch]] composed of two ogees, mirrored left-to-right and meeting at an apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Nikolas|last2=Jokiniemi|first2=Erkki|title=Architect's Illustrated Pocket Dictionary|year=2011|publisher=Architectural Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-08-096537-6|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ogee arches were a feature of [[English Gothic architecture]] in the later thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 391. {{isbn|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moulding===
A building's surface detailing (indoors or out) may have a [[molding (decorative)|moulding]] with an ogee-shaped profile, consisting (going from low to high) of a [[wikt:concave|concave]] arc flowing into a [[wikt:convex|convex]] arc, with vertical ends; if the lower curve is convex and higher one concave, this is known as a [[Roman ogee]], although frequently the terms are used as if they are interchangeable and for a variety of other shapes. Alternative names for such a true Roman ogee moulding include ''cyma reversa'' and ''talon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parker|first=John Henry|authorlink=John Henry Parker|title=A glossary of terms used in Grecian, Roman, Italian, and Gothic  Architecture|volume=1|year=1850|publisher=David Bogue|location=London|page=159|oclc=719426|quote=Cyma recta…which is hollow in the upper part, and round in the lower; and Cyma reversa, (Talon…) which is hollow in the lower part and round in the upper.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cyma reversa]] form occurs in antiquity. For example, in ancient [[Persia]], the [[Tomb of Cyrus]] featured the cyma reversa.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan (2008) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18264 ''Tomb of Cyrus''], The Megalithic Portal, ed. A.{{Page needed|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cyma reversa is also evident in [[ancient Greek architecture]], and takes its name from the [[cymatium]].&lt;ref&gt;W.B.Dinsmoor, 1973{{Page needed|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ogee shape is one of the characteristics of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style of [[architecture]], especially decorative elements in the 14th and 15th century late Gothic styles called [[Flamboyant]] in [[France]] and [[Decorated Period|Decorated]] in [[England]]. Ogee windows and arches were introduced to European cities from the [[Middle East]]. The ogee curve is an analogue of a "[[Molding (decorative)#Types|cyma]] curve", the difference being that a cyma has horizontal rather than vertical ends.

The ogee and Roman ogee profiles are used in decorative moulding, often framed between mouldings with a square section. As such it is part of the standard classical decorative vocabulary, adopted from architrave and cornice mouldings of the [[Ionic order]] and [[Corinthian order]]. An ogee is also often used in the "[[crown moulding]]" frequently found at the top of a piece of [[case furniture]], or for capping a [[baseboard]] or [[plinth]], or where a wall meets the ceiling. An ogee moulding may be run in plaster or wood, or cut in stone or brickwork.

==Other uses==
[[File:Eli Terry Ogee clock.jpg|thumb|150px|Ogee clock, framed with ogee moulding.]]
Ogee is also a mathematical term, meaning an [[inflection point]].

In [[fluid mechanics]], the term is used for an ogee-shaped [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] profile.  For example, a wing may have ogee profile, particularly on supersonic aircraft such as the [[Concorde]].  Also, the downstream face of a dam [[spillway#Chute spillway|spillway]] is usually formed in an ogee curve to minimize water pressure.

An "ogee washer" is a heavy washer with a large bearing surface used in marine timber construction to prevent bolt heads or nuts from sinking into the face of timbers. The term ogee is used due to the ogee shape in radial symmetry around the centre. Due to the size and shape, they are generally manufactured as a cast iron product in accordance with ASTM A47 or A48.

An "ogee clock" is a common kind of weight-driven 19th-century [[pendulum clock]] in a simplified Gothic taste, made in the United States for a mantelpiece or to sit upon a wall bracket.  It is rectangular, with ogee-profile moulding that frames a central glass door that protects the clock face and the pendulum. The weights fall inside the ogee moulding supported by pulleys and hidden from view. The door usually carries a painted scene in the area beneath the face.  Ogee clocks are one of the most commonly encountered varieties of American antique clocks.  The design is usually attributed to [[Chauncey Jerome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=New Haven Clocks &amp; Watches |last=Ly |first=Tran Duy |date=1997 |work=New Haven Clocks &amp; Watches |publisher=Arlington Press |isbn=0930163753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In aesthetic facial surgery, the term is used to describe the malar or cheekbone prominence transitioning into the mid-cheek hollow.  The aim of a mid-face rejuvenation is to restore the ogee curve and enhance the cheekbones.  This enhancement is also commonly a part of a routine [[facelift]].

In distillation, an ogee is the bubble-shaped chamber of a pot still that connects the swan neck to the pot.   It allows distillate to expand, condense, and fall back into the pot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5601">'''Plasma Modeling''' refers to solving [[equations of motion]] that describe the state of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. It is generally coupled with [[Maxwell's Equations]] for [[electromagnetic field]]s or [[Poisson's Equation]] for electrostatic fields.  There are several main types of plasma models: single particle, kinetic, fluid, hybrid kinetic/fluid, gyrokinetic and as system of many particles.

[[Image:A Comparison Chart For Modeling Plasma2.png|800px|Image: 800 pixels|Chart for modeling plasma|right|Image on right]]

==Single Particle Description==
The single particle model describes the plasma as individual electrons and ions moving in imposed (rather than self-consistent) electric and magnetic fields.  The motion of each particle is thus described by the [[Lorentz Force Law]].
In many cases of practical interest, this motion can be treated as the superposition of a relatively fast circular motion around a point called the [[guiding center]] and a relatively slow drift of this point.

==Kinetic Description==
The kinetic model is the most fundamental way to describe a plasma, resultantly producing a [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]]
:&lt;math&gt;f(\vec{x},\vec{v},t)&lt;/math&gt;
where the independent variables &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; are [[position (vector)|position]] and [[velocity]], respectively.
A kinetic description is achieved by solving the [[Boltzmann equation]] or, when the correct description of long-range [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb interaction]] is necessary, by the [[Vlasov equation]] which contains self-consistent collective electromagnetic field, or by the [[Fokker-Planck equation]], in which approximations have been used to derive manageable collision terms. The charges and currents produced by the distribution functions self-consistently determine the electromagnetic fields via [[Maxwell's equations]].

==Fluid Description==
To reduce the complexities in the kinetic description, the fluid model describes the plasma based on macroscopic quantities (velocity moments of the distribution such as density, mean velocity, and mean energy). The equations for macroscopic quantities, called fluid equations, are obtained by taking velocity moments of the [[Boltzmann equation]] or the [[Vlasov equation]]. The fluid equations are not closed without the determination of transport coefficients such as mobility, [[diffusion coefficient]], averaged collision frequencies, and so on. To determine the transport coefficients, the velocity distribution function must be assumed/chosen. But this assumption can lead to a failure of capturing some physics.

==Hybrid Kinetic/Fluid Description==
Although the kinetic model describes the physics accurately, it is more complex (and in the case of numerical simulations, more computationally intensive) than the fluid model.  The hybrid model is a combination of fluid and kinetic models, treating some components of the system as a fluid, and others kinetically.

==Gyrokinetic Description==
In the [[Gyrokinetics|gyrokinetic model]], which is appropriate to systems with a strong background magnetic field, the kinetic equations are averaged over the fast circular motion of the [[gyroradius]].  This model has been used extensively for simulation of [[tokamak]] plasma instabilities (for example, the [[GYRO]] and [[Gyrokinetic ElectroMagnetic]] codes), and more recently in astrophysical applications.

==Quantum Mechanical Methods==
Quantum methods are not yet very common in plasma modeling.  They can be used to solve unique modeling problems; like situations where other methods do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;“A different approach to the MHD equilibrium” Hedditch, John August 2nd, 2018, 4 Pages, submitted to Physics of Plasmas, ArXiv &lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00622&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  They involve the application of [[Quantum Field Theory]] to plasma.  In these cases, the [[electric]] and [[magnetic]] fields made by particles are modeled like a [[Field (mathematics)|field]];  A web of forces.  Particles that move, or are removed from the population push and pull on this web of forces, this field.  The mathematical treatment for this involves [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] mathematics.

A '''quark''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|ɔːr|k|,_|k|w|ɑːr|k}}) is a type of [[elementary particle]] and a fundamental constituent of [[matter]]. Quarks combine to form [[composite particle]]s called [[hadron]]s, the most stable of which are [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, the components of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]].&lt;ref&gt;

 |accessdate=2008-06-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a phenomenon known as ''[[color confinement]]'', quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, which include [[baryon]]s (such as protons and neutrons) and [[meson]]s.&lt;ref name="HyperphysicsConfinment"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of hadrons.

Quarks have various [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] [[physical property|properties]], including [[electric charge]], [[mass]], [[color charge]], and [[spin (physics)|spin]]. They are the only elementary particles in the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] to experience all four [[fundamental interaction]]s, also known as ''fundamental forces'' ([[electromagnetism]], [[gravitation]], [[strong interaction]], and [[weak interaction]]), as well as the only known particles whose electric charges are not [[integer]] multiples of the [[elementary charge]].

There are six types, known as ''[[flavour (particle physics)|flavors]]'', of quarks: [[Up quark|up]], [[Down quark|down]], [[Strange quark|strange]], [[Charm quark|charm]], [[Bottom quark|bottom]], and [[Top quark|top]].&lt;ref name="HyperphysicsQuark"&gt;

 |accessdate=2008-06-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up and down quarks have the lowest [[mass]]es of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks through a process of [[particle decay]]: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the [[universe]], whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in [[high energy physics|high energy]] collisions (such as those involving [[cosmic ray]]s and in [[particle accelerator]]s). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of [[antiparticle]], known as an '''antiquark''', that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties (such as the electric charge) have [[additive inverse|equal magnitude but opposite sign]].

The [[quark model]] was independently proposed by physicists [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[George Zweig]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="Carithers"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quarks were introduced as parts of an ordering scheme for hadrons, and there was little evidence for their physical existence until [[deep inelastic scattering]] experiments at the [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory|Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;

Quarks are [[spin-½|spin-{{Frac|1|2}}]] particles, implying that they are [[fermion]]s according to the [[spin–statistics theorem]]. They are subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which states that no two identical fermions can simultaneously occupy the same [[quantum state]]. This is in contrast to [[boson]]s (particles with integer spin), of which any number can be in the same state.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[lepton]]s, quarks possess [[color charge]], which causes them to engage in the [[strong interaction]]. The resulting attraction between different quarks causes the formation of composite particles known as ''[[hadron]]s'' (see "[[#Strong interaction and color charge|Strong interaction and color charge]]" below).

The quarks that determine the [[quantum number]]s of hadrons are called ''valence quarks''; apart from these, any hadron may contain an indefinite number of [[virtual particle|virtual]] "[[#Sea quarks|sea]]" quarks, antiquarks, and [[gluon]]s, which do not influence its quantum numbers.&lt;ref&gt;

Only first-generation (up and down) quarks occur commonly in nature. Heavier quarks can only be created in high-energy collisions (such as in those involving [[cosmic ray]]s), and decay quickly; however, they are thought to have been present during the first fractions of a second after the [[Big Bang]], when the universe was in an extremely hot and dense phase (the [[quark epoch]]). Studies of heavier quarks are conducted in artificially created conditions, such as in [[particle accelerator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Having electric charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are the only known elementary particles that engage in all four [[fundamental interaction]]s of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction.&lt;ref name="Knowing" /&gt; Gravitation is too weak to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy ([[Planck energy]]) and distance scales ([[Planck distance]]). However, since no successful [[quantum theory of gravity]] exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.

See the [[#Table of properties|table of properties]] below for a more complete overview of the six quark flavors' properties.

At the time of the quark theory's inception, the "[[particle zoo]]" included, amongst other particles, a multitude of [[hadron]]s. Gell-Mann and Zweig posited that they were not elementary particles, but were instead composed of combinations of quarks and antiquarks. Their model involved three flavors of quarks, [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], and [[strange quark|strange]], to which they ascribed properties such as spin and electric charge.&lt;ref name="Gell-Man1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zweig1964a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zweig1964b"/&gt; The initial reaction of the physics community to the proposal was mixed.

In less than a year, extensions to the Gell-Mann–Zweig model were proposed. [[Sheldon Lee Glashow]] and [[James Bjorken]] predicted the existence of a fourth flavor of quark, which they called ''charm''. The addition was proposed because it allowed for a better description of the [[weak interaction]] (the mechanism that allows quarks to decay), equalized the number of known quarks with the number of known [[lepton]]s, and implied a [[mass formula]] that correctly reproduced the masses of the known [[meson]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

The strange quark's existence was indirectly validated by SLAC's scattering experiments: not only was it a necessary component of Gell-Mann and Zweig's three-quark model, but it provided an explanation for the [[kaon]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Kaon}}) and [[pion]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion}}) hadrons discovered in cosmic rays in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;

Charm quarks were produced almost simultaneously by two teams in November 1974 (see [[November Revolution (physics)|November Revolution]])—one at SLAC under [[Burton Richter]], and one at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] under [[Samuel C.

The two parties had assigned the discovered meson two different symbols, {{mvar|J}} and {{mvar|ψ}}; thus, it became formally known as the [[J/ψ meson|{{SubatomicParticle|J/Psi}} meson]].

{{quote|In 1963, when I assigned the name "quark" to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could have been "kwork". Then, in one of my occasional perusals of ''Finnegans Wake'', by James Joyce, I came across the word "quark" in the phrase "Three quarks for Muster Mark". Since "quark" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to rhyme with "Mark", as well as "bark" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as "kwork". But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the "[[portmanteau]]" words in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry "Three quarks for Muster Mark" might be "Three quarts for Mister Mark", in which case the pronunciation "kwork" would not be totally unjustified. In any case, the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in nature.}}

== Properties ==

=== Electric charge ===
{{See also|Electric charge}}
Quarks have [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] electric charge values – either (&amp;minus;{{Frac|1|3}}) or (+{{Frac|2|3}}) times the [[elementary charge]] (e), depending on flavor. Up, charm, and top quarks (collectively referred to as ''up-type quarks'') have a charge of +{{Frac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;e, while down, strange, and bottom quarks (''down-type quarks'') have −{{Frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;e. Antiquarks have the opposite charge to their corresponding quarks; up-type antiquarks have charges of −{{Frac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;e and down-type antiquarks have charges of +{{Frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;e. Since the electric charge of a [[hadron]] is the sum of the charges of the constituent quarks, all hadrons have integer charges: the combination of three quarks (baryons), three antiquarks (antibaryons), or a quark and an antiquark (mesons) always results in integer charges.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the hadron constituents of atomic nuclei, neutrons and protons, have charges of 0&amp;nbsp;e and +1&amp;nbsp;e respectively; the neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark, and the proton of two up quarks and one down quark.&lt;ref name="Knowing" /&gt;

=== Spin ===
{{See also|Spin (physics)}}
Spin is an intrinsic property of elementary particles, and its direction is an important [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]]. It is sometimes visualized as the rotation of an object around its own axis (hence the name "[[Wikt:spin|spin]]"), though this notion is somewhat misguided at subatomic scales because elementary particles are believed to be [[point particle|point-like]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin can be represented by a [[euclidean vector|vector]] whose length is measured in units of the [[reduced Planck constant]] ''ħ'' (pronounced "h bar"). For quarks, a measurement of the spin vector [[vector projection|component]] along any axis can only yield the values +''ħ''/2 or −''ħ''/2; for this reason quarks are classified as [[spin-½|spin-{{Frac|1|2}}]] particles.&lt;ref&gt;

For example, an up quark with a spin of +{{Frac|1|2}} along the ''z'' axis is denoted by u↑.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Weak interaction ===
{{Main article|Weak interaction}}
[[Image:Beta Negative Decay.svg|thumb|right|192px|upright|[[Feynman diagram]] of [[beta decay]] with time flowing upwards. The CKM matrix (discussed below) encodes the probability of this and other quark decays.|alt=A tree diagram consisting mostly of straight arrows. A down quark forks into an up quark and a wavy-arrow W[superscript minus] boson, the latter forking into an electron and reversed-arrow electron antineutrino.]]
A quark of one flavor can transform into a quark of another flavor only through the weak interaction, one of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s in particle physics. By absorbing or emitting a [[W boson]], any up-type quark (up, charm, and top quarks) can change into any down-type quark (down, strange, and bottom quarks) and vice versa. This flavor transformation mechanism causes the [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] process of [[beta decay]], in which a neutron ({{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}) "splits" into a proton ({{SubatomicParticle|proton}}), an [[electron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|electron}}) and an [[electron antineutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|electron antineutrino}}) (see picture). This occurs when one of the down quarks in the neutron ({{SubatomicParticle|up quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|down quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|down quark}}) decays into an up quark by emitting a [[virtual particle|virtual]] {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson, transforming the neutron into a proton ({{SubatomicParticle|up quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|up quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|down quark}}). The {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson then decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino.&lt;ref name="SLAC"&gt;

While the process of flavor transformation is the same for all quarks, each quark has a preference to transform into the quark of its own generation. The relative tendencies of all flavor transformations are described by a [[matrix (mathematics)|mathematical table]], called the [[Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix]] (CKM matrix). Enforcing [[Unitary operator|unitarity]], the approximate [[absolute value|magnitudes]] of the entries of the CKM matrix are:&lt;ref name="PDG2010"&gt;

[[File:Strong force charges.svg|200px|left|thumb|The pattern of strong charges for the three colors of quark, three antiquarks, and eight gluons (with two of zero charge overlapping).]]
According to [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD), quarks possess a property called ''[[color charge]]''. There are three types of color charge, arbitrarily labeled ''blue'', ''green'', and ''red''.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Despite its name, color charge is not related to the color spectrum of visible light.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of them is complemented by an anticolor – ''antiblue'', ''antigreen'', and ''antired''. Every quark carries a color, while every antiquark carries an anticolor.&lt;ref&gt;

The system of attraction and repulsion between quarks charged with different combinations of the three colors is called [[strong interaction]], which is mediated by [[force carrier|force carrying particles]] known as ''[[gluon]]s''; this is discussed at length below. The theory that describes strong interactions is called [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). A quark, which will have a single color value, can form a [[bound state|bound system]] with an antiquark carrying the corresponding anticolor. The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge ''ξ'' plus an antiquark with color charge −''ξ'' will result in a color charge of 0 (or "white" color) and the formation of a [[meson]]. This is analogous to the [[additive color]] model in basic [[optics]]. Similarly, the combination of three quarks, each with different color charges, or three antiquarks, each with anticolor charges, will result in the same "white" color charge and the formation of a [[baryon]] or [[antibaryon]].&lt;ref&gt;

In modern particle physics, [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]] – a kind of [[symmetry group]] – relate interactions between particles (see [[gauge theories]]). Color [[SU(3)]] (commonly abbreviated to SU(3)&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) is the gauge symmetry that relates the color charge in quarks and is the defining symmetry for quantum chromodynamics.&lt;ref name="PeskinSchroeder"&gt;Part III of

Two terms are used in referring to a quark's mass: ''[[current quark]] mass'' refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while ''[[constituent quark]] mass'' refers to the current quark mass plus the mass of the [[gluon]] [[quantum field theory|particle field]] surrounding the quark.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These masses typically have very different values. Most of a hadron's mass comes from the gluons that bind the constituent quarks together, rather than from the quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, they possess energy – more specifically, [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy]] (QCBE) – and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of the hadron (see [[mass in special relativity]]). For example, a proton has a mass of approximately 938&amp;nbsp;[[Electron volt#Mass|MeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], of which the rest mass of its three valence quarks only contributes about 9&amp;nbsp;MeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; much of the remainder can be attributed to the field energy of the gluons.&lt;ref name=PDGQuarks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

=== Size ===
Quarks are treated as zero-dimensional point-like entities of zero size in QCD; the lack of any detectable size in experiments puts an upper bound on their size of 10^-4 the size of a proton, i.e. less than 10^-19 metres &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2014/10/smaller-than-small/ Smaller than Small: Looking for Something New With the LHC by Don Lincoln ''PBS Nova'' blog 28 Oct 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Table of properties ===
{{See also|Flavor (particle physics)}}
The following table summarizes the key properties of the six quarks. [[Flavour quantum numbers|Flavor quantum numbers]] ([[isospin]] (''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Charm (quantum number)|charm]] (''C''), [[strangeness]] (''S'', not to be confused with spin), [[topness]] (''T''), and [[bottomness]] (''B''′)) are assigned to certain quark flavors, and denote qualities of quark-based systems and hadrons. The [[baryon number]] (''B'') is +{{Frac|1|3}} for all quarks, as baryons are made of three quarks. For antiquarks, the electric charge (''Q'') and all flavor quantum numbers (''B'', ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C'', ''S'', ''T'', and ''B''′) are of opposite sign. Mass and [[total angular momentum]] (''J''; equal to spin for point particles) do not change sign for the antiquarks.

==Interacting quarks==
{{See also|Color confinement|Gluon}}

As described by [[quantum chromodynamics]], the [[strong interaction]] between quarks is mediated by gluons, massless [[vector boson|vector]] [[gauge boson]]s. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part of a more general formulation known as [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a [[virtual particle|virtual]] emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.&lt;ref&gt;

Since gluons carry color charge, they themselves are able to emit and absorb other gluons. This causes ''[[asymptotic freedom]]'': as quarks come closer to each other, the chromodynamic binding force between them weakens.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, as the distance between quarks increases, the binding force strengthens. The color field becomes stressed, much as an elastic band is stressed when stretched, and more gluons of appropriate color are spontaneously created to strengthen the field. Above a certain energy threshold, pairs of quarks and antiquarks [[pair creation|are created]]. These pairs bind with the quarks being separated, causing new hadrons to form. This phenomenon is known as ''[[color confinement]]'': quarks never appear in isolation.&lt;ref name="Veltman295"&gt;

=== Sea quarks ===
&lt;!-- Referenced from redirects at Sea quark and elsewhere in this article - if you change this section heading you must change it in those places too.--&gt;
Hadrons contain, along with the ''[[valence quark]]s'' ({{SubatomicParticle|valence quark}}) that contribute to their [[quantum number]]s, [[virtual particle|virtual]] quark–antiquark ({{SubatomicParticle|quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|antiquark}}) pairs known as ''sea quarks'' ({{SubatomicParticle|sea quark}}). Sea quarks form when a gluon of the hadron's color field splits; this process also works in reverse in that the [[annihilation]] of two sea quarks produces a gluon. The result is a constant flux of gluon splits and creations colloquially known as "the sea".&lt;ref&gt;

Under sufficiently extreme conditions, quarks may become deconfined and exist as free particles. In the course of [[asymptotic freedom]], the strong interaction becomes weaker at higher temperatures. Eventually, color confinement would be lost and an extremely hot [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of freely moving quarks and gluons would be formed. This theoretical phase of matter is called [[quark–gluon plasma]].&lt;ref&gt;

The quark–gluon plasma would be characterized by a great increase in the number of heavier quark pairs in relation to the number of up and down quark pairs. It is believed that in the period prior to 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]] (the [[quark epoch]]), the universe was filled with quark–gluon plasma, as the temperature was too high for hadrons to be stable.&lt;ref&gt;

Given sufficiently high baryon densities and relatively low temperatures – possibly comparable to those found in [[neutron star]]s – quark matter is expected to degenerate into a [[Fermi liquid]] of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a [[condensation]] of colored quark [[Cooper pair]]s, thereby [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|breaking the local SU(3)&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry]]. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be [[color superconductivity|color superconductive]]; that is, color charge would be able to pass through it with no resistance.&lt;ref&gt;

{{About|commercial products with the name "Sunshower"|the meteorological phenomenon|Sunshower}}

Several commercial products share the name '''Sunshower'''.

Made by outdoors equipment producer [[Bear Stearns|Stearns Inc.]], the "Sun Shower" is an [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] bag that uses [[solar energy]] to heat water held within. Once heated, the user can take a shower, using the attached tubing and nozzle. Models vary, with different volumes, pressurizers, etc. Stearns also sells a variety of ''Sun Shower'' branded accessories, such as [[Biodegradable waste|bio-degradable]] soap and inflatable shower stalls.

In addition, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company Sunshower B.V. makes a combination shower/[[tanning booth]] branded ''The Sunshower''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5860">'''Too cheap to meter''' describes a [[commodity]] so inexpensive that it is cheaper and less bureaucratic to simply provide it for a [[flat fee]] or even [[Gratis versus libre|free]] and make a [[Profit (economics)|profit]] from associated services. It can also refer to services which it would cost more to itemize bills for the service than it costs to provide the service in the first place, thus it being simpler and less expensive to just provide it in a bundle along with other services.

Although sometimes attributed to [[Walter Marshall, Baron Marshall of Goring|Walter Marshall]], a pioneer of [[nuclear power]] in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/792209.stm Nuclear doubts gnaw deeper]", [[BBC News]], Thursday, 15 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase was coined by [[Lewis Strauss]], then chairman of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], who in a 1954 speech to the National Association of Science Writers said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Our children will enjoy in their homes [[electrical energy]] '''too cheap to meter'''... It is not too much to expect that our children will know of great periodic regional [[famine]]s in the world only as matters of history, will travel effortlessly over the seas and under them and through the air with a minimum of danger and at great speeds, and will experience a lifespan far longer than ours, as disease yields and man comes to understand what causes him to age."&lt;ref name="thisdayinquotes"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2009/09/too-cheap-to-meter-nuclear-quote-debate.html |title=This Day in Quotes: SEPTEMBER 16 - Too cheap to meter: the great nuclear quote debate  |access-date=December 13, 2009 |publisher=This day in quotes |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1613/ML16131A120.pdf Full text of speech]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is often assumed that Strauss' prediction was a reference to conventional [[Nuclear fission|uranium fission]] nuclear reactors. Indeed, only ten days prior to his “Too Cheap To Meter” speech, Strauss was present for the groundbreaking of the [[Shippingport Atomic Power Station]] where he predicted that, "industry would have electrical power from atomic furnaces in five to fifteen years." However, Strauss was possibly referring to [[hydrogen fusion]] power and [[Project Sherwood]], which was conducting secret research on developing practical [[Fusion power|fusion power plants]].&lt;ref&gt;Pfau, Richard (1984) ''No Sacrifice Too Great: The Life of Lewis L. Strauss'' University Press of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0813910382 p. 187] {{ISBN|978-0-8139-1038-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Abundant Power from Atom Seen; It will be too cheap for our children to meter, Strauss tells science writers," New York Times, Sept. 17, 1954, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Strauss gave no public hint at the time that he was referring to fusion reactors, because of the classified nature of Project Sherwood, and the press naturally took his prediction regarding cheap electricity to apply to conventional [[fission reactor]]s. However, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission itself, in testimony to the U.S. Congress only months before, lowered the expectations for fission power, projecting only that the costs of reactors could be brought down to about the same as those for conventional sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893336,00.html ATOMIC ENERGY: The Nuclear Revolution] Time Magazine, February 6, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Strauss viewed hydrogen fusion as the ultimate power source. He was eager to develop the technology as quickly as possible and urged the Project Sherwood researchers to make rapid progress, even suggesting a million-dollar prize to the individual or team that succeeded first.&lt;ref&gt;Bromberg, Joan Lisa (1982) ''Fusion: Science, Politics, and the Invention of a New Energy Source'' MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ECOvgg7b3MQC&amp;pg=PA97 p. 44], {{ISBN|0-262-02180-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Strauss was not optimistic about the rapid commercialisation of fusion power. In August 1955 after fusion research was made public, he cautioned "there has been nothing in the nature of breakthroughs that would warrant anyone assuming that this [fusion power] was anything except a very long range — and I would accent the word ‘very’ — prospect."&lt;ref name=nrcblog-20160603/&gt;

No evidence has been found in Strauss’s archived papers to indicate fusion was the secret subject of his speech.&lt;ref name=nrcblog-20160603&gt;{{cite web |url=https://public-blog.nrc-gateway.gov/2016/06/03/too-cheap-to-meter-a-history-of-the-phrase/ |title="Too Cheap to Meter": A History of the Phrase |author=[[Thomas Wellock]] |publisher=Nuclear Regulatory Commission |date=3 June 2016 |accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Torque density''' is a measure of the torque-carrying capability of a mechanical component. It is the ratio of torque capability to volume and is expressed in units of torque per volume.  Torque density is a system [[property]] since it depends on the design of each element of the component being examined and their interconnection.  

Torque density is useful during the [[concept]] evaluation stage of mechanical [[design]]s, especially in [[power train]] design problems. Typically, it will be one of many factors used to assign potential success measures to each concept. For example, in the upgrade of a drive train for a set of rolls in a [[rolling mill]], space is often dictated by the configuration of current components.  There may be several types of devices that can perform the function of an existing component that must be replaced. The relative torque densities of the devices may be an important determinant for which design is ultimately selected, although it will often compete with other factors such as cost, ease of maintenance, time to install, operating costs and potential failure modes.

==Units==
In [[SI|SI units]], torque density is expressed in [[joule]]s per [[cubic metre]] or equivalently [[newton (unit)|newton]]-[[metre]]s per [[cubic metre]] (though dimensionally equivalent to the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]], that is usually not used for this purpose). Small amounts can be expressed in newton-[[millimetre]]s per cubic millimetre. 

In [[U.S. customary units]], torque density is expressed in [[foot-pound force|foot-pounds force]] per cubic foot, or [[inch]]-pounds force per cubic inch or [[pound-force|ounce-force]] inches per cubic inch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3373">The '''Value of Lost Load''' ('''VoLL''') is the estimated amount that customers receiving [[Electricity generation|electricity]] with [[Electricity market|firm contracts]] would be willing to pay to avoid a [[Power outage|disruption]] in their electricity service.&lt;ref&gt;Vassilopoulos, P., “Models for the Identification of Market Power in Wholesale Electricity Markets”, Industrial Organization, D.E.A 129, September 2003 pp 46 - 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  The value of these losses can be expressed as a customer damage function (CDF).  A CDF is defined&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, M.J. and Keane, D.M., “Outage Cost Estimation Guidebook”, EPRI Research Project 2878-04 Final Report, December 1995, pp 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; as:

	Loss ($/kW) = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''ƒ'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; (duration, season, time of day, notice)

Based on the calculated outage cost, a CDF can be obtained for various customer groups.  Typically, there are three distinct groups of customers: residential, small and medium commercial/industry and large commercial/industrial.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, M.J. and Keane, D.M., “Outage Cost Estimation Guidebook”, EPRI Research Project 2878-04 Final Report, December 1995, pp 8-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Figure 1 below illustrates the incremental CDFs of these three groups.

[[Image:Voll cdf.JPG|frame|'''Figure 1: Example Customer Damage Functions''']]

The CDF relates the magnitude of customer losses (per kW interrupted) for a given duration of a power outage.  While the general shapes of all three curves are similar, the magnitude of loss varies dramatically depending on the customer’s size.  Based on VoLL data from an EGAT survey in March and April 2000,&lt;ref&gt;“Electricity Outage Cost Study”, http://www.eppo.go.th/power/ERI-study-E/ERI-ExeSummary-E.html, 19 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; it was estimated that the customers’ costs in the first hour for residential customers was Baht 11.45/kW.  For large commercial/industrial (C/I) and small &amp; medium C/I customers, the cost in the first hour was Baht 29.55/kW and Baht 89.50 /kW respectively.  Further research from [[Electric Power Research Institute|EPRI]] indicates that residential customers’ cost tend to peak at USD 1.50/kW in the first hour and falls of to USD 0.46/kW in subsequent hours.  On the other hand, large C/I and small &amp; medium C/I suffer much higher losses of USD 10/kW and USD 38/kW respectively in the first hour.  This falls to USD 4/kW and USD 9/kW respectively in the subsequent hours.

The CDF predicts the loss per interrupted kW based on factors that influence the outage.  The CDF is usually calculated based on defined market segments such as residential, commercial, and industrial.  This is done because there are large variations of costs across the utility market segments.  However, in a large area it is a normal practice that the interruption cost is aggregated to represent a general picture of the load losses.  The aggregated interruption cost is called the composite CDF.
