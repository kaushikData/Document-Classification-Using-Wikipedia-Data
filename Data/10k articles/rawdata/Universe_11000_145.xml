The '''Mississauga train derailment''' of 1979, also known as the '''Mississauga Miracle''' occurred on Saturday, November 10, 1979, in [[Mississauga|Mississauga, Ontario]], Canada, when a 106-car [[Canadian Pacific]] freight train carrying chemicals and explosives including [[styrene]], [[toluene]], [[propane]], [[caustic soda]], and [[chlorine]] from [[Windsor, Ontario]] [[derailment|derailed]] near the intersection of [[Mavis Road]] and [[Dundas Street, Toronto|Dundas Street]] in [[Mississauga, Ontario]]. As a result of the derailment, more than 200,000 people were evacuated in what was the largest peacetime evacuation in North America until the [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|New Orleans evacuation of 2005]].  There were no deaths resulting from the incident. This was the last major explosion in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] until the [[2008 Toronto propane explosion|Sunrise Propane blast]] in 2008.

==Causes==
On the 33rd car, heat began to build up in an improperly-lubricated [[journal box|journal bearing]] on one of the wheels, one of the few still in use at that time as most had long since been replaced with [[roller bearing]]s, resulting in the condition known among train workers as a "[[hot box]]". Residents living beside the tracks reported smoke and sparks coming from the car, and those who were close to Mississauga thought the train was afire. The friction eventually burned through the axle and bearing, and as the train was passing the [[Burnhamthorpe Road]] level crossing, a [[wheelset (rail transport)|wheelset]] (one axle and pair of wheels) fell off completely.

==Explosion and evacuation==
At 11:53&amp;nbsp;p.m., at the Mavis Road crossing, the damaged bogie ([[Bogie|undercarriage]]) left the track, causing the remaining parts of the train to derail. The impact caused several tank cars filled with propane to burst into flames.

The derailment also ruptured several other tankers, spilling [[styrene]], [[toluene]], [[propane]], [[caustic soda]], and [[chlorine]] onto the tracks and into the air. A huge explosion resulted, sending a fireball {{convert|1500|m|ft|-3|abbr=on}} into the sky which could be seen from {{convert|100|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} away. As the flames were erupting, the train's brakeman, Larry Krupa, 27, at the suggestion of the engineer (also his father-in-law),&lt;ref name="Train Wreck"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bibel|first=George|title=Train Wreck: The Forensics of Rail Disasters|date=2012|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=9781421405902|pages=171–2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HiU7KmXmx3oC&amp;pg=PT171|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; managed to close an air brake angle spigot at the west end of the undamaged 32nd car, allowing the engineer to release the air brakes between the locomotives and the derailed cars and move the front part of the train eastward along the tracks, away from danger. This prevented those cars from becoming involved in the fire, important as many of them also contained dangerous goods. Mr. Krupa was later recommended for the [[Order of Canada]] for his bravery,&lt;ref name="Missisauga heritage page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mississauga Train Derailment|url=http://www.heritagemississauga.com/page/Mississauga-Train-Derailment|publisher=Heritage Missisauga|date=November 10, 2009|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which a later writer has described as "bordering on lunacy."&lt;ref name="Train Wreck" /&gt;

After more explosions, firefighters concentrated on cooling cars, allowing the fire to burn itself out, but a ruptured chlorine tank became a cause for concern. With the possibility of a deadly cloud of chlorine gas spreading through suburban Mississauga, more than 200,000 people were evacuated. A number of residents (mostly the extreme west and north of Mississauga) allowed evacuees to stay with them until the crisis abated. Some of these people were later moved again as their hosts were also evacuated. The evacuation was managed by various officials including the mayor of Mississauga, [[Hazel McCallion]], the [[Peel Regional Police]] and other governmental authorities. McCallion [[sprain]]ed her ankle early during the crisis, but continued to hobble to press conferences.

==Aftermath==
Within a few days Mississauga was practically deserted, until the contamination had been cleared, the danger neutralized and residents were allowed to return to their homes. The city was finally reopened on the evening of November 16. The chlorine tank was emptied on November 19.

It was the largest peacetime evacuation in North American history until the evacuation of [[New Orleans]] due to [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, and remains the second-largest as of 2016.

Due to the speed and efficiency with which it was conducted, many cities later studied and modelled their own emergency plans after Mississauga's.

As a result of the accident, rail regulators in both the U.S. and Canada required that any line used to carry hazardous materials into or through a populated area have [[hot box|hotbox]] [[defect detector|detectors]].&lt;ref name="Train Wreck 174"&gt;Bibel, 174&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Larry Krupa was inducted into the [[North America Railway Hall of Fame]] for his contribution to the railway industry. He was recognized in the "National" division of the "Railway Workers &amp; Builders" category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://narhf.org/?s=Krupa The North America Railway Hall of Fame | Inductees: Larry Krupa]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Hazel McCallion]], in her first term as mayor at the time of the accident, was continuously re-elected ever since until her retirement in 2014 at age 93.

The song Trainwreck 1979 by Canadian band [[Death From Above 1979]] is about the derailment:

''It ran off the track, 11-79''
&lt;br /&gt;''While the immigrants slept, there wasn't much time''
&lt;br /&gt;''The mayor came calling and got 'em outta bed''
&lt;br /&gt;''They packed up their families and headed upwind''
&lt;br /&gt;''A poison cloud, a flaming sky, 200,000 people and no one died''
&lt;br /&gt;''And all before the pocket dial, yeah!''

==History==
The Tariki / Ahuroa field was discovered in 1986.  Construction of wellsite facilities began in 1995 and production commenced in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.nzpam.govt.nz/cms/pdf-library/petroleum-conferences-1/1998-petroleum-conference-proceedings/GLogan_development_engineering.pdf |title=Development and Engineering Highlights in 1996/1997 |first=Geoff |last=Logan |date=30 March 1998 |conference=1998 New Zealand Petroleum Conference |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223202833/https://www.nzpam.govt.nz/cms/pdf-library/petroleum-conferences-1/1998-petroleum-conference-proceedings/GLogan_development_engineering.pdf |archivedate=23 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The facility was in turn owned by [[Fletcher Challenge]], Shell and Swift Energy.

In 2008, when the field was largely depleted, it was acquired by [[Origin Energy]] as part of the Tariki / Ahuroa / Waihapa / Ngaere assets.  The gas storage facility was constructed by [[Contact Energy]] in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newzealandenergy.com/files/doc_presentations/NZECPPT-StrategicAcquisition.pdf| title=Strategic Taranaki Acquisition| publisher=[[New Zealand Energy Corporation]]| date=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Contact Energy sold the gas storage facility to Gas Services New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://www.nzx.com/announcements/312253| title=Contact Energy to sell AGS to Gas Services New Zealand| publisher=Contact Energy| date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asplenium trichomanes''''' (commonly known as '''maidenhair spleenwort'''&lt;ref name=BSBI07&gt;{{cite web|title=BSBI List 2007 |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland |url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |format=xls |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6VqJ46atN?url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |archive-date=2015-01-25 |accessdate=2014-10-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a small [[fern]] in the spleenwort [[genus]] ''[[Asplenium]]''. It is a widespread and common species, occurring almost worldwide in a variety of rocky [[habitat]]s. It is a variable fern with several [[subspecies]].

The [[binomial nomenclature|specific epithet]] ''trichomanes'' refers to a Greek word for “fern”.&lt;ref name=RHSLG&gt;{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Lorraine |title=RHS Latin for Gardeners |year=2012 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley |location=United Kingdom |isbn=184533731X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It grows in tufts from a short [[rhizome]]. The [[frond]]s are long and narrow, gradually tapering towards the tip. They are simply divided into small, yellow-green to dark-green [[Frond|pinna]]e. The [[stipe (botany)|stipe]] and [[rachis]] of the frond are dark all along their length. The fronds can reach 40&amp;nbsp;cm in length but are more commonly 8–20&amp;nbsp;cm. They bear long, narrow [[sorus|sori]] which contain the [[spore]]s.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is widespread in [[temperate]] and [[subarctic]] areas and also occurs in mountainous regions in the [[tropics]]. Its range includes most of Europe and much of Asia south to [[Turkey]], [[Iran]] and the [[Himalayas]] with a population in [[Yemen]]. It occurs in northern, southern and parts of eastern Africa and also in eastern [[Indonesia]], south-east Australia, [[Tasmania]], New Zealand and [[Hawaii]]. It is found in [[North America]] and [[Central America]] and [[Cuba]], and the northern and western regions of [[South America]] such as [[Chile]].

It grows in rocky habitats such as cliffs, [[scree]] slopes, walls and mine waste, the type of rock used as a substrate depending on the subspecies. It grows from sea-level up to 3000 metres in North America while in the British Isles it reaches 870 metres.

==Cultivation==
''Asplenium trichomanes'' is valued in cultivation for its hardiness (down to {{convert|-20|C|F}}), its evergreen foliage and its ability to colonise crevices in stone walls. It prefers a fully or partially shaded aspect. It has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]’s [[Award of Garden Merit]].&lt;ref name = RHSPF&gt;{{cite web 
| url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/1731/i-Asplenium-trichomanes-i/Details
|title = RHS Plantfinder - ''Asplenium trichomanes'' 
| publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subspecies==
''Asplenium trichomanes'' has diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid [[cytotype]]s, which it has been argued should be recognised as distinct species. A triploid cytotype (a sterile hybrid between the diploid and tetraploid cytotype) is also known. Within these cytotypes several subspecies are recognised, including

*''Asplenium trichomanes'' subsp. ''trichomanes'' prefers [[acid]]ic rocks such as [[sandstone]], [[basalt]] and [[granite]]. In Europe and North America it is most often found in mountainous areas and is commonest in the north. It is a delicate plant with a slender stipe and rachis and relatively few pinnae. Diploid.
*''Asplenium trichomanes'' subsp. ''quadrivalens'' prefers [[calcareous]] rocks such as [[limestone]] and [[dolomite]] and often grows on the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in walls. It is commoner than ''A. t.'' subsp. ''trichomanes'' in much of Europe but is less widespread in North America, although it is present in southern North America where ssp. ''trichomanes'' is absent. Compared to the nominate subspecies it is stouter and has more pinnae which are more square in shape and have less of a stalk. The fronds tend to grow close to the rock while those of ''A. t.'' subsp. ''trichomanes'' tend to arch away. Tetraploid.
*''Asplenium trichomanes'' subsp. ''pachyrachis'' (syn. ''Asplenium csikii'') is mainly found on limestone rocks and walls. It is small and delicate, grows close to the rock and has a rigid, fragile stipe and rachis. Tetraploid.
*[[Asplenium trichomanes subsp. coriaceifolium|''Asplenium trichomanes'' subsp. ''coriaceifolium'']] (syn. ''Asplenium azomanes''): [[Majorca]], Spain, Morocco. Tetraploid.[[File:Asplenium trichomanes2.JPG|right|thumb|Sori on the underside of the frond]]

A '''booster pump''' is a machine which will increase the [[pressure]] of a fluid. They may be used with liquids or gases, but the construction details will vary depending on the fluid.
A gas booster is similar to a [[gas compressor]], but generally a simpler mechanism which often has only a single stage of compression, and is used to increase pressure of a gas already above ambient pressure. Two-stage boosters are also made.&lt;ref name="Low cost boosters" /&gt;
Boosters may be used for increasing gas pressure, transferring high pressure gas, charging [[gas cylinder]]s and scavenging.

On new construction and retrofit projects, water pressure booster pumps are used to provide adequate water pressure to upper floors of high rise buildings. The need for a water pressure booster pump can also arise after the installation of a backflow prevention device (BFP), which is currently mandated in many municipalities{{where?|date=May 2018}} to protect the public water supplies from contaminants within a building entering the public water supply. The use of BFPs began after The [[Clean Water Act]] was passed. These devices can cause a loss of 12 PSI, and can cause [[flushometers]] on upper floors not to work properly.
After pipes have been in service for an extended period, scale can build up on the inside surfaces which will cause a pressure drop when the water flows.

==Construction and function==
Booster pumps are usually [[Reciprocating compressor|piston]] or plunger type compressors. A single-acting, single-stage booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed to withstand the operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and discharge ports, to which the supply and discharge hoses or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the inlet hose, through the inlet valve into the space between the cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the outlet hose is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the outlet hose is connected to. This flow will stop when the pressure is equalized, taking valve opening pressures into account.&lt;ref name="Low cost boosters" /&gt;

Once the flow has stopped, the booster is started, and as the piston withdraws along the cylinder, increasing the volume between the cylinder head and the piston crown, the pressure in the cylinder will drop, and gas will flow in from the inlet port. On the return cycle, the piston moves toward the cylinder head, decreasing the volume of the space and compressing the gas until the pressure is sufficient to overcome the pressure in the outlet line and the opening pressure of the outlet valve. At that point, the gas will flow out of the cylinder via the outlet valve and port. 

There will always be some compressed gas remaining in the cylinder and cylinder head spaces at the top of the stroke. The gas in this "dead space" will expand during the next induction stroke, and only after it has dropped below the supply gas pressure, more supply gas will flow into the cylinder. The ratio of the volume of the cylinder space with the piston fully withdrawn, to the dead space, is the "compression ratio" of the booster, also termed "boost ratio" in this context. Efficiency of the booster is related to the compression ratio, and gas will only be transferred while the pressure ratio between supply and discharge gas is less than the boost ratio, and delivery rate will drop as the inlet to delivery pressure ratio increases.

Delivery rate starts at very close to swept volume when there is no pressure difference, and drops steadily until there is no effective transfer when the pressure ratio reaches the maximum boost ratio.&lt;ref name="Low cost boosters" /&gt;

Compression of gas will cause a rise in temperature. The heat is mostly carried out by the compressed gas, but the booster components will also be heated by contact with the hot gas. Some boosters are cooled by water jackets or external fins to increase convectional cooling by the ambient air, but smaller models may have no special cooling facilities at all. Cooling arrangements will improve efficiency, but will cost more to manufacture.

Boosters to be used with oxygen must be made from oxygen-compatible materials, and use oxygen-compatible lubricants to avoid fire.&lt;ref name="Low cost boosters" /&gt;

==Power sources==
[[File:Russian booster pump back IMG 0410.JPG|thumb|Back view of Russian oxygen booster pump]]
[[File:Russian booster pump IMG 0409.JPG|thumb|End view of Russian oxygen booster pump]]
Boosters may be driven by an [[electric motor]], [[hydraulics]], low or high pressure air or manually by a lever system. Those powered by [[compressed air]] are usually linear actuated systems, where a pneumatic cylinder directly drives the compression piston, often in a common housing, separated by a seal. A high pressure pneumatic drive arrangement may use the same pressure as the output pressure to drive the piston, and a low pressure drive will use a larger diameter piston to multiply the applied force.&lt;ref name="Low cost boosters"/&gt;

==Manufacturers==
High pressure gas boosters are manufactured by Haskel, Draeger and others. Rugged and unsophisticated models (KN-3 and KN-4) were manufactured for the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and surplus examples are now used by [[Technical diving|technical divers]] as they are relatively inexpensive and are supplied with a comprehensive spares and tool kit. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Scottish sites of Carlin stones or natural features ==

===Carlin Skerry, Orkney===
This is a rocky islet in the South of Orkney.&lt;ref name="Carsphairn"&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/gazetteer/vol1page237.htm Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alvah, Aberdeenshire===
Near Sandlaw Farm in the parish of Alvah is the Carlin Cist, thought to have been part of a [[Dolmen|Cromlech]] at one time.&lt;ref name="Statistical"&gt;''The New Statistical Account of Scotland''. 1834. P. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backhill of Drachlaw, Aberdeenshire===
This stone was part of a recumbent stone circle, around {{convert|95|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter. It has several alternative names, such as the Caerlin stone; Cairn Riv; Cairn Rib; or Cairn-Rieve. Its map reference in the parish of Inverkeithny is NJ 6744 4659. Three stones remain in line, the Carlin Stone between two others quite small in comparison. In addition, there are two set stones projecting inward from the Carlin Stone.
This boulder is rugged, unshapely, and most unusual in height. Other stones were broken up and removed within relatively recent times; the mounds of stones being carted away for making dikes or drystone walls. In or near the circle were found a small perforated axe-hammer, portions of 3 bronze armlets, flint chips and a jet button.&lt;ref name="Carlin2"&gt;[http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/pls/portal/newcanmore.newcandig_details_gis?inumlink=18323 The Inverkeithny Carlin Stone.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aberdeenshire"&gt;[http://www.megalithia.com/sites/nj674465.html Aberdeenshire Carlin Stone]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copper(I) thiocyanate''' (or cuprous thiocyanate) is a [[coordination polymer]] with formula CuSCN. It is an air-stable, white solid used as a precursor for the preparation of other thiocyanate salts.

== Structure ==
Two [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] have been characterized. The one pictured above features copper(I) in a characteristic tetrahedral coordination geometry. The sulfur end of the SCN- ligand is triply [[bridging ligand|bridging]].&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, D. L.; Saunders, V. I. "Preparation and Structure Refinement of the 2H Polytype of beta-Copper(I) Thiocyanate" Acta Crystallographica B, 1982, volume 38, 907-909. {{DOI|10.1107/S0567740882004361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==
Copper(I) thiocyanate forms from the spontaneous decomposition of dry black copper(II) thiocyanate, releasing [[thiocyanogen]], especially when heated. It is also formed from copper(II) thiocyanate under water, releasing (among others) [[thiocyanic acid]] and the highly poisonous [[hydrogen cyanide]].&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is conveniently prepared from solutions of copper(II) in water, such as copper(II) sulphate. To a copper(II) solution [[sulphurous acid]] is added and then a soluble thiocyanate is added (preferably slowly, while stirring&lt;ref name=j3/&gt;). Copper(I) thiocyanate is precipitated as a white powder.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt; Alternatively, a [[thiosulfate]] solution may be used as a reducing agent.

== Double salts ==
Copper(I) thiocyanate forms one double salt with the group 1 elements, CsCu (SCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The double salt only forms from concentrated solutions of CsSCN, into which CuSCN dissolves. From less concentrated solutions, solid CuSCN separates reflecting its low solubility.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;
When brought together with potassium, sodium or barium thiocyanate, and brought to crystallisation by concentrating the solution, mixed salts will crystallise out. These are not considered true double salts. As with CsCu (SNC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, copper(I) thiocyanate separates out when these mixed salts are redissolved or their solutions diluted.&lt;ref name=b2/&gt;

== Uses ==
Copper(I) thiocyanate is a [[electron hole|hole]] conductor, a [[semiconductor]] with a [[wideband materials|wide]] [[band gap]] (3.6 [[electronvolt|eV]], therefore transparent to visible and near infrared light).&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nanostructured Materials|author=Wilde, G.|date=2009|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780080914237|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1qnL0qO9KNcC&amp;pg=PA256|page=256|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in [[photovoltaics]] in some third-generation cells as a hole transfer layer. It acts as a [[P-type semiconductor]] and as a solid-state electrolyte. It is often used in [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s. Its hole conductivity is however relatively poor (0.01 [[Siemens (unit)|S]].m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. This can be improved by various treatments, e.g. exposure to gaseous [[chlorine]] or doping with (SCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Photochemistry|author1=Albini, A.|author2=Fausto, R.|author3=de Melo, J.S.S.|author4=Maldotti, A.|author5=Clementi, C.|author6=Kalyanasundaram, K.|author7=Johnston, L.J.|author8=Harbron, E.|author9=Misawa, H.|author10=Romani, A.|date=2011|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=9781849731652|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NJJTW_zU5QUC&amp;pg=PA164|page=164|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CuSCN with [[nickel(II) oxide|NiO]] act synergically as a smoke suppressant additive in [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].

CuSCN precipitated on carbon support can be used for conversion of aryl halides to aryl thiocyanates.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Supported Reagents: Preparation, Analysis, and Applications|author1=Clark, J.H.|author2=Kybett, A.P.|author3=Macquarrie, D.J.|date=1992|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780471187790|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V7ahxSHqMqMC&amp;pg=PA121|page=121|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper thiocyanate is used in some [[anti-fouling paint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.copperantifouling.com/copper/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.F. Vetere et al, "Solubility and Toxic Effect of the Cuprous Thiocyanate Antifouling Pigment on Barnacle Larvae", Journal of Coatings Technology, 69:39 (March 1997) https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02696144&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages compared to [[cuprous oxide]] include that the compound is white and a more efficient biocide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5435">'''Current limiting''' is the practice in electrical or [[electronics|electronic]] [[Electronic circuit|circuit]]s of imposing an upper limit on the [[electric current|current]] that may be delivered to a [[External electric load|load]] with the purpose of protecting the circuit generating or transmitting the current from harmful effects due to a [[short-circuit]] or similar problem in the [[Electrical load|load]].

==Inrush current limiting==

{{Main article|Inrush current limiter}}

An [[inrush current limiter]] is a device or group of devices used to limit inrush current. Negative [[temperature coefficient]] (NTC) [[thermistors]] and [[resistors]] are two of the simplest options, with cool-down time and power dissipation being their main drawbacks, respectively. More complex solutions can be used when design constraints make simpler options infeasible.

==In electronic power circuits==
[[File:Использование блока ограничителя тока.gif|thumb|right|200px|Active current limiting or short-circuit protection]]
Some electronic circuits employ active current limiting, since a fuse may not protect solid-state devices.  

One style of current limiting circuit is shown in the image. The schematic is representative of a simple protection mechanism used in regulated DC supplies and [[Linear amplifier|class-AB power amplifiers]].{{efn|For class-AB stages, the circuit will be mirrored vertically and complementary devices will be used for Q1 &amp; Q2.}}

Q1 is the pass or output transistor. R&lt;sub&gt;sens&lt;/sub&gt; is the load current sensing device. Q2 is the protection transistor which turns on as soon as the voltage across R&lt;sub&gt;sens&lt;/sub&gt; becomes about 0.65 V. This voltage is determined by the value of R&lt;sub&gt;sens&lt;/sub&gt; and the load current through it (I&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt;). When Q2 turns on, it removes base current from Q1 thereby reducing the collector current of Q1. which is very nearly the load current. Thus, R&lt;sub&gt;sens&lt;/sub&gt; fixes the maximum current to a value given by 0.65/R&lt;sub&gt;sens&lt;/sub&gt;.  For example, if R&lt;sub&gt;sens&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.33&amp;nbsp;Ω, the current is limited to about 2&amp;nbsp;A even if R&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt; becomes a short (and V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; becomes zero). 

Further, this power dissipation will remain as long as the overload exists, which means that the devices must be capable of withstanding it for a substantial period. This power dissipation will be substantially less than if no current limiting circuit had been provided.  In this technique, beyond the current limit the output voltage will decrease to a value depending on the current limit and load resistance.

==Single power-supply circuits==
[[File:Ограничение извести с помощью PNP-транзисторов.png|thumb|right|200px|Current limiter with PNP transistors]]
[[File:Ограничение извести с помощью NPN-транзисторов.png|thumb|left|200px|Current limiter with NPN transistors]]
An issue with the previous circuit is that Q1 will not be saturated unless its base is biased about 0.5 volts above V{{sub|cc}}.

The circuits at right and left operate more efficiently from a single (V{{sub|cc}}) supply.  In both circuits, R1 allows Q1 to turn on and pass voltage and current to the load.  When the current through R_sense exceeds the design limit, Q2 begins to turn on, which in turn begins to turn off Q1, thus limiting the load current.  The optional component R2 protects Q2 in the event of a short-circuited load.  When V{{sub|cc}} is at least a few volts, a [[MOSFET]] can be used for Q1 for lower dropout voltage.  Due to its simplicity, this circuit is sometimes used as a [[current source]] for high-power LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Stuff!!!

==Slew rate control==
Many electronics designers put a small resistor on IC output pins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://massmind.org/techref/electips.htm#series_resistor IC output series resistor]&lt;/ref&gt;
This slows the edge rate which improves [[electromagnetic compatibility]]. Some devices have this "[[slew rate]] limiting" output resistor built in; some devices&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freescale.com/files/microcontrollers/doc/data_sheet/MC9S12XHZ512.pdf Freescale MC9S12XHZ512]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=1999&amp;ty=&amp;dty=&amp;section=&amp;NextRow=&amp;ssUserText=slew%20rate Microchip PIC18F87J50]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://initio.com/products/info/inic_940.htm Initio INIC-940] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018142732/http://initio.com/products/info/inic_940.htm |date=October 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.thomasnet.com/fullstory/24648 Fairchild FDC6901L]&lt;/ref&gt; have programmable slew rate limiting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3402">'''Density gradient''' is a spatial variation in [[density]] over an area. The term is used in the [[natural sciences]] to describe varying density of [[matter]], but can apply to any [[quantity]] whose density can be [[measured]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Aerodynamics==
In the study of [[supersonic]] flight, [[Schlieren photography]] observes the density gradient of air as it interacts with aircraft.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics, Density gradient is used to observe the acoustic waves, shock waves or expansion waves in the flow field.

==Water==
A steep density gradient in a body of water can have the effect of trapping energy and preventing [[convection]], such a gradient is employed in [[solar pond]]s. In the case of salt water, sharp gradients can lead to [[Stratification (water)|stratification]] of different concentrations of [[salinity]]. This is called a [[Halocline]].

==Biology==
In the life sciences, a special technique called density gradient separation is used for isolating and purifying cells, viruses and subcellular particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = GE Healthcare Density Gradient Separation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of this include [[Isopycnic centrifugation]], [[Differential centrifugation]], and [[Sucrose gradient centrifugation]]. A blood donation technique called [[Pheresis]] involves density gradient separation.

==Geophysics==

The understanding of what is at the centre of the earth, the [[earth core]], requires the framework of density gradients in which elements and compounds then interact. [[Fast breeder nuclear reactor]] at the core of the earth is one theory by reason of density gradient and supported and espoused by [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/93/2/646 J. Marvin Herndon] (7 &amp; 8).

==Regional Economics==
In the study of population, the density gradient can refer to the change in density in an urban area from the center to the periphery.

The '''Dodge Stratus''' is a [[mid-size car|mid-size]] car that was introduced by [[Dodge]] in February 1995, and was based on the 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] [[Chrysler JA platform]]. The Stratus, [[Plymouth Breeze]], and [[Chrysler Cirrus]] were all on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997. It received critical acclaim at launch, but ratings fell over time. An updated version of the Stratus was introduced for 2001, with the Cirrus being renamed as the [[Chrysler Sebring]], and a [[coupé]] model was also added to the range. However, production ended at the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant in early 2006 which had built 1,308,123 Stratus and Sebrings since 2000.&lt;ref name='gone'&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2006/05/21/stratus-and-sebring-gone-for-good/ |title=Stratus and Sebring gone for good |work=Autoblog |date=May 21, 2006 |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Dodge Avenger]] replaced the Stratus nameplate in early 2007 for the 2008 [[model year]].

After the discontinuation of the Stratus sedan in 2006, the assembly line and tooling were sold to the Russian concern, [[GAZ]], which manufactured 9,000 examples of a very slightly modified Stratus from 2008 through 2010 called the [[Volga Siber]].

==First generation (1995–2000)==
[[File:'99 Dodge Stratus.JPG|thumb|left|Front]]
[[File:Stratus '95.jpg|right|thumb|rear]]

{{main|Chrysler Cirrus}}
The Dodge Stratus was the middle entry of the [[Chrysler JA platform]] (with the Cirrus being the higher-end model and the Breeze being the lower-end model). The three cars differed only in the front fascia, rear bumper, taillights, and wheels. The interiors also had little variation between the three models; being almost identical, save for the name on the steering wheel, and a few available options. The Stratus directly replaced the high-volume [[Dodge Spirit|Spirit]] ([[United States]] only)

In Mexico, since 1996 to 2000 the Stratus R/T came in a turbocharged version (also the Cirrus). The Stratus R/T's turbocharged EDZ 2.4L  engine went through some improvements in 1996 when power was increased to 168 hp's @2,200.  All 2.4L turbo engines was only for the Mexican market.

The car competed in the [[Swedish Touring Car Championship]] under the name Chrysler Stratus.

In 2000, the Stratus became the last of the surviving Cloud Cars, with the Cirrus renamed as the Sebring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/chrysler-sebring-lxi-road-test |title=Chrysler Sebring LXi Road Test |publisher=Car and Driver |date=December 2000 |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |first=Larry |last=Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Breeze discontinued (along with the Plymouth brand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://consumerguide.com/used/1996-00-plymouth-breeze/ |title=1996–2000 Plymouth Breeze |publisher=Consumer Guide Auto |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generation of the Dodge Stratus was not sold in [[Canada]], although 1999 was the last year for Dodge Stratus sales in Canada. 2002 models dropped the "DODGE" badges from the doors.

[[File:Dodge-Stratus-2.jpg|thumb|left|2004–2006 Dodge Stratus sedan]]

The Stratus and Sebring [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s for the second generation used a revised version of the Chrysler JA platform named [[Chrysler JA platform#JR|JR]].  The coupe models with the same names were entirely different cars; they were actually based on the [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]].

During this time, sales declined as its ratings from consumer and auto magazines fell below average among mid-size cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/03q1/2003_dodge_stratus_vs._honda_accord_hyundai_sonata_kia_optima_and_six_more_mid-size_sedans-comparison_tests | title = 2003 Dodge Stratus vs. Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima, and Six More Mid-Size Sedans - Comparison Tests | first = Barry | last = Winfield | journal = Car and Driver | date = February 2003 | accessdate = 2010-07-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100731074726/http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/03q1/2003_dodge_stratus_vs._honda_accord_hyundai_sonata_kia_optima_and_six_more_mid-size_sedans-comparison_tests | archivedate = 2010-07-31 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the sedan market had shifted and pushed the larger Intrepid and later [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Charger]] to record sales. 2004 brought styling revisions, which did not reverse this trend. The Stratus was discontinued in May 2006&lt;ref name='gone'/&gt; (the Sebring name was continued).

In [[Mexico]], the Stratus R/T came in a turbocharged version. The Stratus R/T's turbocharged 2.4 L engine went through some improvements in 2001, when power was increased to {{Convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This improved engine would later be used in the U.S. in the [[Dodge SRT-4]] and [[Chrysler PT Cruiser|PT Cruiser GT]]. Stratus R/T engines built from March 2004 and later generated {{Convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm and {{convert|235|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 4200 rpm. Stratus R/T models with the turbocharged engine could be recognized by a rear badge saying "Turbo".

===Stratus coupe===
[[File:2001 Dodge Stratus SE coupe -- NHTSA 02.jpg|thumb|left|2001 Dodge Stratus SE coupe]]
For 2001, Dodge introduced the '''Stratus''' coupe, replacing the discontinued [[Dodge Avenger#Dodge Avenger coupe .281995.E2.80.932000.29|Avenger]]. This model along with the [[Chrysler Sebring#Coupe|Chrysler Sebring coupe]] was built at the former [[Diamond Star Motors]] plant by [[Mitsubishi Motors North America|Mitsubishi]], using the [[Chrysler D platform#ST-22|ST-22 platform]]. Like its Chrysler counterpart, the coupe models shared very little other than the name and a few exterior styling cues with sedan and convertible models. The Stratus coupe was restyled for the 2003 model year. The coupe was discontinued after 2005, one year before the sedan. The next midsize Dodge, the [[Dodge Avenger#Dodge Avenger sedan .282008.E2.80.932013.29|Avenger]], did not include a coupe version.

==Safety==
The first generation Dodge Stratus received a "Poor" rating in the IIHS frontal crash test. It was actually a Chrysler Cirrus that was tested, but the results also apply to the Stratus, and also the Plymouth Breeze. The second generation Stratus and its twin, the Chrysler Sebring, received an overall "Acceptable" rating in the IIHS frontal test due to a possible injury to the right leg. On the side test, the Stratus receives a "Poor" rating without optional side airbags due to a serious neck injury, a weak side structure, possible rib fractures, and high forces on the shoulder and pelvis. Its seats and head restraints earn an overall "Acceptable" rating from the IIHS. 

==Licensed production in Russia==
{{Main|Volga Siber}}
The license and production facilities for the second generation Dodge Stratus and [[Chrysler Sebring]] sedans were sold in April 2006 to Russian billionaire [[Oleg Deripaska]], owner the [[GAZ]] company in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], which builds the [[Volga (automobile)|Volga]] automobile. The models were built by GAZ in Russia from late 2007 through 2010 as the [[Volga Siber]] at a price of approximately US$151 million (€ 124 million). The production facilities are planned to build up to 65,000 cars of both models yearly. Four-cylinder engines were to be purchased from Chrysler and made in Mexico.

The first powerline, which was built in 1977 and runs from [[Zaporizhzhia thermal power station|Zaporizhzhia Thermal Power Plant]], consists of five 100 metres and two 90 metres high pylons, which were built on [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] in the water. The caissons with the pylons were prefabricated and then erected in the reservoir.

In 1984 a 750 kV powerline with a single circuit for transport of energy produced in the [[Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant]] was built. It consists of three 126 metres and two 100 metres high [[Electricity_pylon|pylons]], which stand also on [[Caisson_(engineering)|caissons]] in Kahovskoe reservoir of the [[Dnieper River|Dnipro river]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1347">'''Ferroelasticity''' is a [[phenomenon]] in which a material may exhibit a spontaneous strain. In [[ferroics]], ferroelasticity is the mechanical equivalent of [[ferroelectricity]] and [[ferromagnetism]]. When stress is applied to a ferroelastic material, a phase change will occur in the material from one phase to an equally stable phase, either of different [[crystal structure]] (e.g. cubic to tetragonal), or of different orientation (a 'twin' phase). This stress-induced phase change results in a spontaneous strain in the material.

The shape memory effect and [[superelasticity]] are manifestations of ferroelasticity. [[Nitinol]] (nickel titanium), a common ferroelastic alloy, can display either superelasticity or the shape - memory effect at room temperature, depending on the nickel / titanium ratio.

'''Fiber volume ratio''' is an important [[mathematics|mathematical]] element in composite [[engineering]]. '''Fiber volume ratio''', or fiber [[volume fraction]], is the percentage of fiber volume in the entire volume of a [[fiber-reinforced composite]] material.&lt;ref name=hull&gt;Derek Hull. (1981).''An Introduction to Composite Materials''. [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; When manufacturing polymer composites, fibers are impregnated with resin. The amount of resin to fiber ratio is calculated by the geometric organization of the fibers, which affects the amount of resin that can enter the composite. The impregnation around the fibers is highly dependent on the orientation of the fibers and the architecture of the fibers. The geometric analysis of the composite can be seen in the cross-section of the composite. Voids are often formed in a composite structure throughout the manufacturing process and must be calculated into the total fiber volume fraction of the composite. The fraction of fiber reinforcement is very important in determining the overall mechanical properties of a composite. A higher fiber volume fraction typically results in better mechanical properties of the composite.&lt;ref name=endru&gt;A. Endruweit, F. Gommer, A.C. Long. ''Stochastic analysis of fibre volume fraction and permeability in fibre bundles with random filament arrangement'', Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, Volume 49, June 2013, Pages 109-118, ISSN 1359-835X.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating the volume of fiber ratio in a composite is relatively simple. The volume fiber fraction can be calculated using a combination of weights, densities, elastic moduli, stresses in respective directions, poison's ratios, and volumes of the matrix (resin system), fibers, and voids.

&lt;math&gt; V_f = \frac{v_f}{v_c}\! &lt;/math&gt;   &lt;ref name=isaac&gt;Isaac M Daniel, Ori Ishai. (2006).''Engineering Mechanics of Composite Materials''. 2nd ed. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-19-532244-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;V_f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fiber]] volume [[ratio]]

and

: &lt;math&gt;v_f&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of fibers
: &lt;math&gt;v_c&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the composite

==Methods to Determine Fiber Volume Fractions==

===Acid Digestion===

This procedure involves the digestion of the polymer matrix using an acid which does not attack
the fibers. Following digestion, the remaining fibers are washed, dried, and weighed. Knowing the initial weight of the composite specimen as well as the densities of the fiber and resin, the volume fraction of both the fiber and matrix in the original laminate may be determined. This method is generally used for composites composed of carbon fiber reinforcement.&lt;ref name=gibson&gt;Gibson, R. (2007). ''Principles of composite material mechanics'' (2nd ed.). Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optical microscopy-based techniques===

Optical microscopy-based techniques involve potting sectioned samples of the laminate, polished using standard metallographic techniques, and obtaining digital cross-sectional photomicrographs using an optical microscope and magnifications between 100 and 2500.&lt;ref name=cann&gt;Michael T. Cann, Daniel O. Adams and Claudio L. Schneider, ''Characterization of Fiber Volume Fraction Gradients in Composite Laminates'', Journal of Composite Materials, 2008 42: 447&lt;/ref&gt; Digital images may be recorded at a number of locations along the length and through-the-thickness of the laminate. Computer programs aid in the analysis of fiber ratio in the photomicrograph of the polished composite specimen. This method is preferred as a non-destructive approach to determining fiber volume fraction.&lt;ref name=gibson/&gt;

===Resin Burning-off Method===

This method involves heating up the composite to a temperature at which resin will melt and fibers remain stable, burning off resin and weighing fibers, the volume fraction can be calculated from the initial weight of composite and fiber’s weight.&lt;ref name=bradford&gt;Bradford, Philip. ''Fiber Finishing, Properties and Architecture.'' TE565 Class Lecture. NCSU College of Textiles, Raleigh. 14 Sept. 2014. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt; This method is typically used with glass fibers.&lt;ref name=pan&gt;Pan, N. (1993). ''Theoretical determination of the optimal fiber volume fraction and fiber-matrix property compatibility of short fiber composites.'' Polymer Composites, 14(2), 85-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of Fiber Volume Fraction==

The amount of fiber in a fiber reinforced composite directly corresponds with the mechanical properties of the composite. Theoretically the maximum fiber ratio of round fibers that can be achieved in a composite is 90.8% if the fibers are in a unidirectional hexagonal close packed configuration. Realistically the highest fiber volume ratio is around 70% due to manufacturing parameters and is usually in the range of 50% to 65%.&lt;ref name=gibson/&gt; Adding too little fiber reinforcement in the composite will actually deteriorate the properties of the material. Too much fiber volume may also decrease the strength of the composite due to the lack of space for the matrix to fully surround and bond with the fibers.&lt;ref name=fu&gt;Fu, Shao-Tun, Bernd Lauke, and Yiu-Wing Mai. ''Science and Engineering of Short Fibre Reinforced Polymer Composites''. Woodhead Limited, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there is an optimal space between fibers that will fully exploit the uniform load transfer between fibers.&lt;ref name=pan/&gt; Given the fiber volume fraction, the theoretical elastic properties of a composite can be determined. The [[elastic modulus]] of a composite in the fiber direction of a unidirectional composite can be calculated using the following equation:

	 
&lt;math&gt; E = (1-{V_f}){E_m}+{V_f}{E_f} &lt;/math&gt;

Where:
: &lt;math&gt;V_f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fiber]] volume [[ratio]]

and

: &lt;math&gt;E_m&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic modulus of the matrix
: &lt;math&gt;E_f&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic modulus of the fibers

==Common Fiber Packing Arrangements==

Fibers are commonly arranged in a square or hexagonal lattice as well as in a layer-wise fiber array.
Assuming that each fiber has a circular cross-sectional with the same diameter, the fiber volume fraction of these two kinds of packing are respectively:

'''Hexagonal '''

&lt;math&gt;{V_f}= ({\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt3}}){(\frac{r}{R})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Square'''

&lt;math&gt;{V_f}= ({\frac{\pi}{4}}){(\frac{r}{R})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of fiber

and 
:&lt;math&gt;2R&lt;/math&gt; is the center to center spacing of the fibers.

The maximum fiber volume fraction will occur when the fibers are touching, i.e. r=R. For a hexagonal array &lt;math&gt;V_{f,max}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.907, and for square packing &lt;math&gt;V_{f,max}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.785.

However, these are ideal situations only used for theoretical analysis. In practical cases there can be variation in fiber diameter and irregular packing. In practice, it’s hard to achieve a volume fraction greater than 0.7 and this must be regarded as the realistic limit for commercial materials.

In the production process, using different fiber architecture methods can obtain different volume fractions. 2D aligned unidirectional fabrics with [[pre-preg]] (usually carbon) fibers are considered to have the highest volume fraction among common fiber architectures.&lt;ref name=bradford/&gt; Filament winding is also usually associated with high fiber volume fractions – with careful control of fiber tension and resin content, values of around 70% are possible.&lt;ref name=gibson/&gt;

==Void Volume Fraction==

[[Porosity]] or void fraction is a measure of the void (i.e., "empty") spaces in a material, and is a fraction of the volume of voids over the total volume, between 0 and 1, or as a percentage between 0 and 100%. There are many ways to determine if a composite part contains voids, such as industrial CT scanning or [[ultrasound]]. If the volume fraction of the fibers and matrix is known, the volume voids can also be found using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; V_v = 1 - V_f - V_m = \frac {v_v}{v_c} \!&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;ref name=isaac/&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;V_v&lt;/math&gt; is the void volume ratio

and
: &lt;math&gt;V_f&lt;/math&gt; is the fiber volume ratio
: &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix volume ratio
: &lt;math&gt;v_v&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of voids
: &lt;math&gt;v_c&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the composite

Another equation used to calculate void volume fraction is:

&lt;math&gt; V_v = \frac {({p_{ct}}-{p_{cm}})}{p_{ct}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: &lt;math&gt;V_v&lt;/math&gt; is the void volume ratio

and

:&lt;math&gt;p_{ct}&lt;/math&gt; is the theoretical density of the composite without voids

:&lt;math&gt;p_{cm}&lt;/math&gt; is the measured density of the composite

===Measuring Void Content===

There are many methods of evaluating the void content of materials (including composites). The first is to exam a polished section, identifying the voids in the section, either manually or using computer-aid analysis and determining the area fraction which corresponds to the volume fraction of the composite.

Another method requires accurate measurement of the density of the sample and comparing it to the theoretical density in the equation described in the previous section. The density is determined by weighing the sample in air and then in a liquid of known density. Application of Archimedes’ principle leads to the following expression for the measured density of the sample in terms of measured weight, where subscripts “a” and “L” refer to air and liquid,respectively:&lt;ref name=cann/&gt;

&lt;math&gt; p = \frac {(W_{apL}-W_{Lpa})}{(W_a-W_L)} \!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=hull/&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the measured density of the composite sample
 
and

:&lt;math&gt;W_{apL}&lt;/math&gt; is the weight of composite in  air
:&lt;math&gt;W_{Lpa}&lt;/math&gt; is the weight of composite in liquid
:&lt;math&gt;W_a&lt;/math&gt; is the weight of air
:&lt;math&gt;W_L&lt;/math&gt; is the weight of liquid

The liquid used in this method should have a high density and chemical stability and low vapour pressure and surface tension. The most popular liquid currently in use is perfluoro- 1 - methyl decalin.&lt;ref name=endru/&gt;

[[Image:Full depth recycling screenshot.jpg|thumb|Full Depth Reclamation]]

'''Full depth recycling''' or '''full depth reclamation''' ('''FDR'''), is a process that rebuilds worn out [[asphalt]] [[Pavement (material)|pavements]] by recycling the existing roadway.

Old asphalt and base materials are pulverized using a specialized machine called a [[reclaimer]]. On top of the pulverized material, water is added to reach the optimal moisture content for [[Soil compaction|compaction]] and then a variety of materials, such as dry [[cement]], [[Lime (mineral)|lime]], [[fly ash]], or asphalt [[emulsion]] are incorporated for [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilization]]. A reclaimer is used again to mix all the materials. After shaping and [[Grade (slope)|grading]], the new base is compacted to produce a strong, durable base for either an asphalt or [[concrete]] surface.

Since this method [[recycle]]s the materials ''[[in situ]]'', there is no need to haul in [[Aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] or haul out old material for [[waste management|disposal]]. The [[vehicle]] movements are reduced and there is no need for detours since it can be done under [[traffic]], making this process more convenient for local residents.

FDR with cement saves money while preserving [[natural resource]]s by using existing materials and conserving virgin [[construction aggregate|aggregates]]. The road performance is improved through better stabilization, building a stronger, low-maintenance road that will last for many years.

With proper engineering and testing protocols the FDR process provides a design life-cycle of 30-years.  FDR is a manufacturing process and not an installation.  Other pavement materials, such as concrete, asphalt, or aggregate base go through a rigorous quality control program that meets a qualified standard prior to site delivery and contractor installation.  The FDR process requires the same level of understanding and product controls during lab testing and field verification to meet long-term performance goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1805">A '''Gold universe''' is a [[cosmology|cosmological]] model of the [[universe]].  In these models, the universe starts with a [[Big Bang]] and expands for some time, with increasing [[entropy]] and a  [[thermodynamic]] [[arrow of time]] pointing in the direction of the expansion.  After the universe reaches a low-density state, it recontracts, but entropy now decreases, pointing the thermodynamic arrow of time in the opposite direction, until the universe ends in a low-entropy, high-density [[Big Crunch]]. 
There are two models of the universe which support the possibility of a reversed direction of time. The first begins with a state of low entropy at the Big Bang which continually increases until the Big Crunch. The second, a Gold Universe, posits that entropy will increase only until a moment of contraction, then gradually decrease. This latter model suggests the universe will become more orderly after the moment of contraction. The Gold model has been linked to the possibility of retrocausal change, questions concerning the preservation of information in a time-reversed universe (states of decreasing entropy), and [[Causality (physics)|causation]] in general.  The Gold Universe is named after the cosmologist [[Thomas Gold]], who proposed the model in the 1960s.

[[File:Gustnado in Jefferson County, Kansas on April 3, 2011.jpg|thumb|A gustnado near [[Williamstown, Kansas]] on 3 April 2011. This gustnado is a good example that gustnadoes can cause damage; it caused damage akin to that of a weak tornado: "Two [[center pivot irrigation]]s were flipped over, a large outdoor shed was destroyed and several tree limbs were snapped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Severe Weather: Sunday April 3|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=top&amp;storyid=66167&amp;source=0|author=National Weather Service Topeka, KS|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Colorado_Gustnado.jpg|thumb|A gustnado East of [[Limon, Colorado]]]]

A '''gustnado''' is a short-lived, shallow surface-based [[vortex]] which forms within the [[downburst]] emanating from a [[thunderstorm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is That a Tornado? Scud Clouds, Wall Clouds, Gustnadoes and Other Scary Clouds That Look Like the Real Thing|url=https://weather.com/news/news/thats-not-a-tornado-20130307|author=Chrissy Warrilow |publisher=Weather.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[gust front]] [[tornado]]", as gustnadoes form due to non-tornadic [[straight-line wind]] features in the [[downdraft]] ([[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]]), specifically within the gust front of strong thunderstorms. Gustnadoes tend to be noticed when the vortices loft sufficient debris or form condensation [[cloud]] to be visible although it is the [[wind]] that makes the gustnado, similarly to tornadoes. As these eddies very rarely connect from the surface to the [[cloud base]], they are very rarely considered as tornadoes. The gustnado has little in common with tornadoes structurally or dynamically in regard to vertical development, [[Tornado intensity|intensity]], longevity, or [[Tornadogenesis|formative process]] --as classic tornadoes are associated with [[mesocyclone]]s within the [[inflow (meteorology)|inflow]] ([[updraft]]) of the storm, not the outflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Glickman |first = Todd S. (ed.) |title = Glossary of Meteorology |publisher = American Meteorological Society |edition = 2nd |date = 2000 |location = Boston |pages = |url = http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Gustnado |doi = |isbn = 978-1-878220-34-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#gustnado1 |title = What is a Gustnado? |last = Edwards |first = Roger |date = 1 May 2017 |website = Tornado FAQ |publisher = NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction Center |access-date = 2017-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The average gustnado lasts a few seconds to a few minutes, although there can be several generations and simultaneous swarms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gustnado or Crop Circles?|url=https://www.weather.gov/lmk/Gustnado_crop_circles|author=National Weather Service Louisville, KY|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most have the winds of an [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF-0 or EF-1]] tornado (up to 110 mph or 177 km/h), and are commonly mistaken for tornadoes. However, unlike tornadoes, the rotating column of air in a gustnado ''usually'' does not extend all the way to the base of the thundercloud. Gustnadoes actually have more in common with [[Whirlwind (atmospheric phenomenon)|whirlwinds]]. They are not considered true tornadoes (unless they connect the surface to the ambient cloud base) by most meteorologists and are not included in tornado statistics in most areas. Sometimes referred to as '''spin-up tornadoes''', that term more correctly describes the rare tornadic gustnado that connects the surface to the ambient clouded base, or more commonly to the relatively brief but true tornadoes that are associated with a [[mesovortex]]. 

The most common setting for a gustnado is along the gust front of a severe thunderstorm (more than {{convert|58|mph|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}} winds), along which horizontal shear of the wind may be large.  A particularly common location is along the rear-flank gust front of supercell storms. Gustnadoes probably form owing to shear instability associated with the strong horizontal shear; a relative maximum in vertical vorticity must exist in order for shear instability to be present.   The bigger question is probably what the dynamical origin(s) of the vertical vorticity is (are), such as the tilting of horizontal vorticity into the vertical or vertical vorticity in the ambient environment that preexists the storm.  Along the rear-flank gust front of supercell storms, vertical vorticity very likely has its origins in the upward tilting of vorticity that can occur within descending air in the presence of baroclinity.  

While injuries or deaths are rare from gustnadoes, strong ones can cause damage and they are hazardous to drivers. There is some speculation that a gustnado might have been responsible for the [[Indiana State Fair stage collapse|collapse of a stage at the Indiana State Fair]] on August 13, 2011 which killed 7 people and injured 58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Gustnado" May Have Caused Indiana Stage Collapse|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gustnado-may-have-caused-indiana-stage-collapse|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''heliosphere''' is the bubble-like [[outer space#Interplanetary space|region of space]] dominated by the [[Sun]], which extends far beyond the orbit of [[Pluto]]. [[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] "blown" out from the Sun, known as the [[solar wind]], creates and maintains this bubble against the outside [[pressure]] of the [[interstellar medium]], the hydrogen and helium gas that permeates the [[Milky Way|Milky Way Galaxy]]. The solar wind flows outward from the Sun until encountering the '''termination shock''', where motion slows abruptly. The [[Voyager program|Voyager spacecraft]] have explored the outer reaches of the heliosphere, passing through the shock and entering the '''heliosheath''', a transitional region which is in turn bounded by the outermost edge of the heliosphere, called the '''heliopause'''. The shape of the heliosphere is controlled by the interstellar medium through which it is traveling, as well as the Sun and is not perfectly spherical.&lt;ref name="nasa-voyager-proves" /&gt; The limited data available and unexplored nature of these structures have resulted in many theories.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican-voyager" /&gt; The word "heliosphere" is said to have been coined by [[Alexander J. Dessler]], who is credited with first use of the word in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="dessler-revgeophys" /&gt;

On September 12, 2013, [[NASA]] announced that [[Voyager 1]] left the heliopause on August 25, 2012, when it measured a sudden increase in plasma density of about forty times.&lt;ref name="voyager-historic" /&gt; Because the heliopause marks [[Solar System#Boundaries|one boundary]] between the Sun's solar wind and the rest of the galaxy, a spacecraft such as Voyager 1 which has departed the heliosphere, can be said to have reached [[Outer space#Interstellar space|interstellar space]].

The idea of Heliosphere is an area of the influence of the Sun, and a major component is magnetic field lines and the solar wind; three major aspects to its edge are the termination shock, the heliosheath, and the heliopause. Five spacecraft have returned much of the data about its furthest reaches including Pioneer 10 (1972-1997; data to 67 AU), Pioneer 11 (1973-1995;44 AU), Voyager 1 and 2 (launched 1977, ongoing), and New Horizons (Launched 2006). A type of particle called an ENA has also been observed to have been produced from its edges. Near the Sun, there is a host of spacecraft that observe the Sun and interplanetary space, and one of the latest to explore nearer to the Sun than ever before is the [[Parker Solar Probe]] launched in 2018. Solar observations, such by Solar eclipses that allow observation of the Corona and various types of space observatories also provide data on the Sun and its influences. The study of other Stars can also allow insights indirectly.

Except for [[Magnetosphere|regions]] near obstacles such as [[planet]]s or [[Comet#Coma and tail|comets]], the heliosphere is dominated by material emanating from the Sun, although [[cosmic rays]], [[Energetic neutral atoms|fast-moving neutral atoms]], and [[cosmic dust]] can penetrate the heliosphere from the outside. Originating at the extremely hot surface of the [[corona]], solar wind particles reach [[escape velocity]], streaming outwards at 300 to 800&amp;nbsp;km/s (671 thousand to 1.79 million mph or 1 to 2.9 million km/h).&lt;ref&gt;[http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SolarWind.shtml The Solar Wind]&lt;/ref&gt; As it begins to interact with the [[interstellar medium]], its velocity slows to a stop. The point where the solar wind becomes slower than the speed of sound is called the [[Heliosphere#Termination shock|termination shock]]; the solar wind continues to slow as it passes through the [[heliosheath]] leading to a boundary called the [[Heliopause (astronomy)#Heliopause|heliopause]], where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance. The termination shock was traversed by [[Voyager 1]] in 2004,&lt;ref name=voyager/&gt; and [[Voyager 2]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="nasa-voyager-proves" /&gt;

It was thought that beyond the heliopause there was a [[bow shock]], but data from [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer]] suggested the velocity of the Sun through the interstellar medium is too low for it to form.&lt;ref name="No-Bow-Shock" /&gt; It may be a more gentle "bow wave".&lt;ref name=zank&gt;{{cite journal|title=Heliospheric Structure: The Bow Wave and the Hydrogen Wall|first1=G.

== Solar wind ==
{{main|Solar wind|Interplanetary medium}}
[[File:The Sun as seen in January 1st 2015.jpg|thumb|Earth's Sun as seen at a wavelength of 19.3 nanometers ([[ultraviolet]])]]

The solar wind consists of particles ([[ion]]ized atoms from the solar [[corona]]) and fields (in particular, [[magnetic field]]s).{{clarify|date=June 2015}} Because the Sun [[rotation|rotate]]s once approximately every 25 days, the magnetic field transported by the [[solar wind]] gets wrapped into a spiral. Variations in the Sun's magnetic field are carried outward by the solar wind and can produce [[Geomagnetic storm|magnetic storm]]s in the Earth's own [[magnetosphere]].{{clarify|date=June 2015}}

== Structure ==
[[File:Heliospheric-current-sheet.gif|thumb|200px|left|The heliospheric current sheet out to the orbit of Jupiter]]

=== Heliospheric current sheet ===
{{main|Heliospheric current sheet}}

The [[heliospheric current sheet]] is a ripple in the heliosphere created by the rotating magnetic field of the Sun. Extending throughout the heliosphere, it is considered the largest structure in the Solar System and is said to resemble a "ballerina's skirt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mursula, K. |author2=Hiltula, T. |bibcode=2003GeoRL..30.2135M |title=Bashful ballerina: Southward shifted heliospheric current sheet |date=2003 |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=30 |issue=22 |page=2135 |doi=10.1029/2003GL018201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outer structure ===

The outer structure of the heliosphere is determined by the interactions between the solar wind and the winds of interstellar space. The solar wind streams away from the Sun in all directions at speeds of several hundred km/s in the Earth's vicinity. At some distance from the Sun, well beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]], this supersonic wind must slow down to meet the gases in the [[interstellar medium]]. This takes place in several stages:
* The solar wind is traveling at [[supersonic]] speeds within the Solar System. At the termination shock, a standing [[shock wave]], the solar wind falls below the speed of sound and becomes [[Speed of sound|subsonic]].
* It was previously thought that, once subsonic, the solar wind would be shaped by the ambient flow of the interstellar medium, forming blunt nose on one side and comet-like heliotail behind, a region called the heliosheath. However, observations in 2009 showed that this model is incorrect.&lt;ref name="Cassini-shape-solar-system" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBEX-2009" /&gt; As of 2011, it is thought to be filled with a magnetic bubble "foam".&lt;ref name=surprise/&gt;
* The outer surface of the heliosheath, where the heliosphere meets the interstellar medium, is called the '''heliopause'''. This is the edge of the entire heliosphere. Observations in 2009 led to changes to this model.&lt;ref name="Cassini-shape-solar-system" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBEX-2009" /&gt;
* In theory, the heliopause causes turbulence in the interstellar medium as the sun orbits the [[Galactic Center]]. Outside the heliopause, would be a turbulent region caused by the pressure of the advancing heliopause against the [[interstellar medium]]. However, the velocity of Solar wind relative to the interstellar medium is probably too low for a bow shock.&lt;ref name="No-Bow-Shock" /&gt;

=== Termination shock ===
[[File:Heliosphere-washbasin.svg|thumb|A termination shock in a sink basin]]

The termination shock is the point in the heliosphere where the solar wind slows down to [[Speed of sound#Speed of sound in plasma|subsonic]] speed (relative to the Sun) because of interactions with the local [[interstellar medium]]. This causes [[compression (physical)|compression]], heating, and a change in the [[magnetic field]]. In the [[Solar System]] the termination shock is believed to be 75 to 90 [[astronomical unit]]s&lt;ref name="apod-heliosphere" /&gt; from the Sun. In 2004, [[Voyager 1]] crossed the [[Sun]]'s termination shock followed by [[Voyager 2]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/voyager-1210.html |title=MIT instrument finds surprises at solar system's edge |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |date=2007-12-10 |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The shock arises because solar wind particles are emitted from the Sun at about 400&amp;nbsp;km/s, while the speed of sound (in the interstellar medium) is about 100&amp;nbsp;km/s. (The exact speed depends on the density, which fluctuates considerably.) The interstellar medium, although very low in density, nonetheless has a constant pressure associated with it; the pressure from the solar wind decreases with the square of the distance from the Sun. As one moves far enough away from the Sun, the pressure of the solar wind drops to where it can no longer maintain supersonic flow against the pressure of the interstellar medium, at which point the solar wind slows to below its speed of sound, causing a [[shock wave]]. Further from the Sun, the termination shock is followed by the heliopause, where the two pressures become equal and solar wind particles are stopped by the interstellar medium.

Other termination shocks can be seen in terrestrial systems; perhaps the easiest may be seen by simply running a water [[Tap (valve)|tap]] into a [[sink]] creating a [[hydraulic jump]]. Upon hitting the floor of the sink, the flowing water spreads out at a speed that is higher than the local [[Phase velocity|wave speed]], forming a disk of shallow, rapidly diverging flow (analogous to the tenuous, supersonic solar wind). Around the periphery of the disk, a shock front or wall of water forms; outside the shock front, the water moves slower than the local wave speed (analogous to the subsonic interstellar medium).

Evidence presented at a meeting of the [[American Geophysical Union]] in May 2005 by [[Ed Stone]] suggests that the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' spacecraft passed the termination shock in December 2004, when it was about 94 AU from the Sun, by virtue of the change in magnetic readings taken from the craft. In contrast, ''[[Voyager 2]]'' began detecting returning particles when it was only 76 AU from the Sun, in May 2006. This implies that the heliosphere may be irregularly shaped, bulging outwards in the Sun's northern hemisphere and pushed inward in the south.&lt;ref name="voyager_II_cnn"&gt;{{cite news

=== Heliosheath ===

The heliosheath is the region of the heliosphere beyond the termination shock. Here the wind is slowed, compressed and made turbulent by its interaction with the interstellar medium. Its distance from the [[Sun]] is approximately 80 to 100 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) at its closest point.

A proposed model hypothesizes that the heliosheath is shaped like the [[coma (cometary)|coma]] of a comet, and trails several times that distance in the direction opposite to the Sun's path through space. At its windward side, its thickness is estimated to be between 10 and 100 AU.&lt;ref name="Brandt-2007" /&gt; However, observations in 2009 showed that model may be incorrect.&lt;ref name="Cassini-shape-solar-system" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBEX-2009" /&gt;

The ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' spacecraft have studied the heliosheath. In late 2010, ''Voyager 1'' reached a region of the heliosheath where the solar wind's velocity had dropped to zero.&lt;ref name = "Amos"&gt;{{cite news| first=Jonathan | last=Amos | date=December 14, 2010 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11988466 | title=Voyager near Solar Systems edge | accessdate = 2010-12-10 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Space.Com"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA's Voyager 1 Spacecraft Nearing Edge of the Solar System|website=Space.Com |date = 2010-12-13|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/nasa-voyager-1-leaving-solar-system-101213.html|accessdate=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brumfiel"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Voyager 1'' and ''2'' began detecting evidence for the bubbles in 2007 and 2008, respectively.&lt;ref name = "Rayl"/&gt; The probably sausage-shaped bubbles are formed by [[magnetic reconnection]] between oppositely oriented sectors of the [[solar magnetic field]] as the solar wind slows down.&lt;ref name = "Rayl"/&gt; They probably represent self-contained structures that have detached from the [[interplanetary magnetic field]].&lt;ref name = "Cook"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rayl"/&gt;

=== Heliopause ===

The heliopause is the theoretical boundary where the [[Sun]]'s [[solar wind]] is stopped by the [[interstellar medium]]; where the solar wind's strength is no longer great enough to push back the [[stellar wind]]s of the surrounding stars. This is the boundary where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance. The crossing of the heliopause should be signaled by a sharp drop in the temperature of charged particles,&lt;ref name = "Space.Com"/&gt; a change in the direction of the magnetic field, and an increase in the number of galactic cosmic rays.&lt;ref name=rays/&gt; In May 2012, ''[[Voyager&amp;nbsp;1]]'' detected a rapid increase in such cosmic rays (a 9% increase in a month, following a more gradual increase of 25% from Jan. 2009 to Jan. 2012), suggesting it was approaching the heliopause.&lt;ref name=rays/&gt;  In September of 2013, NASA announced that Voyager 1 had crossed the heliopause as of August 25, 2012.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was at a distance of 121 AU (18 billion km) from the Sun.&lt;ref name="Cowen2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cowen | first1 = R. | doi = 10.1038/nature.2013.13735 | title = Voyager 1 has reached interstellar space | journal = Nature | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to predictions, data from Voyager 1 indicates the magnetic field of the galaxy is aligned with the solar magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vergano|first1=Dan|title=Voyager 1 Leaves Solar System, NASA Confirms|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130911-voyager-interstellar-solar-system-nasa-science-space/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=9 February 2015|date=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heliotail ===

The heliotail is the tail of the heliosphere, and thus the solar system's tail. It can be compared to the tail of a comet (however, a comet's tail does not stretch behind it as it moves; it is always pointing away from the Sun). The tail is a region where the Sun's  solar wind slows down and ultimately escapes the heliosphere, slowly evaporating because of charge exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/5553/the-unexpected-structure-of-the-heliotail "The Unexpected Structure of the Heliotail"], ''Astrobiology''. July 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
The shape of the heliotail (newly found by NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer - IBEX), is that of a four-leaf clover.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cole, Steve. [http://www.nasa.gov/press/2013/july/nasa-satellite-provides-first-view-of-the-solar-systems-tail/#.UmxeevmkrJa "NASA Satellite Provides First View of the Solar System's Tail"] NASA News Release 12-211, July 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The particles in the tail do not shine, therefore it cannot be seen with conventional optical instruments. IBEX made the first observations of the heliotail by measuring the energy of "energetic neutral atoms", neutral particles created by collisions in the solar system's boundary zone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The tail has been shown to contain fast and slow particles; the slow particles are on the side and the fast particles are encompassed in the center. The shape of the tail can be linked to the sun sending out fast solar winds near its poles and slow solar wind near its equator more recently. The clover-shaped tail moves further away from the sun, which makes the charged particles begin to morph into a new orientation.

The heliopause is the final known boundary between the heliosphere and the interstellar space that is filled with material, especially plasma, not from our own star, the Sun, but from other stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/glossary.html#.UjjiKW1pP3Uis|title=Voyager Glossary|first=Tony|last=Greicius|date=11 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, just outside the heliosphere (i.e. the "solar bubble") there is a transitional region, as detected by Voyager 1.&lt;ref name=interstellar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager20130912.html|title=NASA Spacecraft Embarks on Historic Journey Into Interstellar Space|first=Tony|last=Greicius|date=5 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as some interstellar pressure was detected as early as 2004, some of the Sun's material seeps into the interstellar medium.&lt;ref name=interstellar/&gt; The heliosphere is thought to reside in the [[Local Interstellar Cloud]] inside the [[Local Bubble]], which is a region in the [[Orion Arm]] of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]].

Outside the heliosphere there is a forty-fold increase in plasma density.&lt;ref name=interstellar/&gt; There is also a radical reduction in the detection of certain types of particles from the Sun, and a large increase in Galactic cosmic rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-278|title=How Do We Know When Voyager Reaches Interstellar Space?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flow of the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) into the heliosphere has been measured by at least 11 different spacecraft as of 2013.&lt;ref name=flow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/interstellar-wind-changed-direction-over-40-years/|title=Interstellar Wind Changed Direction Over 40 Years|first=Holly|last=Zell|date=6 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, it was suspected that the direction of the flow had changed over time.&lt;ref name=flow/&gt; The flow, coming from Earth's perspective from the constellation Scorpius, has probably changed direction by several degrees since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=flow/&gt;

=== Hydrogen wall ===
{{Redirect|Hydrogen wall|other topics|Hydrogen (disambiguation)}}

According to one hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Wood, B. E. |author2=Alexander, W. R. |author3=Linsky, J.

The wall is composed of interstellar material interacting with the edge of the heliosphere. One paper released in 2013 studied the concept of a bow wave and hydrogen wall.&lt;ref name=zank /&gt;

Another hypothesis suggests that the heliopause could be smaller on the side of the Solar System facing the Sun's orbital motion through the galaxy. It may also vary depending on the current velocity of the solar wind and the local density of the interstellar medium. It is known to lie far outside the orbit of [[Neptune]]. The current mission of the ''Voyager&amp;nbsp;1'' and ''[[Voyager 2|2]]'' spacecraft is to find and study the termination shock, heliosheath, and heliopause. Meanwhile, the [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer]] (IBEX) mission is attempting to image the heliopause from Earth orbit within two years of its 2008 launch. Initial results (October 2009) from IBEX suggest that previous assumptions are insufficiently cognisant of the true complexities of the heliopause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8309179.stm|title=BBC News article | date=October 15, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010|first=Jason|last=Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, long-term studies about the hydrogen wall by the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft confirmed results first detected in 1992 by the two [[Voyager program|''Voyager'' spacecrafts]].&lt;ref name="GRL-20180807"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gladstone |first1=G.

=== Bow shock ===
{{further|Bow shocks in astrophysics}}

It was long hypothesized that the [[Sun]] produces a "shock wave" in its travels within the interstellar medium. It would occur if the interstellar medium is moving supersonically "toward" the Sun, since its solar wind moves "away" from the Sun supersonically. When the interstellar wind hits the heliosphere it slows and creates a region of turbulence. A bow shock was thought to possibly occur at about 230&amp;nbsp;AU,&lt;ref name="apod-heliosphere" /&gt; but in 2012 it was determined it probably does not exist.&lt;ref name="No-Bow-Shock" /&gt; This conclusion resulted from new measurements: The velocity of the LISM (Local Interstellar Medium) relative to the Sun's was previously measured to be 26.3&amp;nbsp;km/s by [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]], whereas IBEX measured it at 23.2&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrobites.com/2012/05/14/no-shocks-for-this-bow-ibex-says-were-wrong/|title=No Shocks for This Bow: IBEX Says We're Wrong|date=14 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon has been observed outside the Solar System, around stars other than the Sun, by NASA's now retired orbital [[GALEX]] telescope. The red giant star [[Mira]] in the constellation [[Cetus]] has been shown to have both a debris tail of ejecta from the star and a distinct shock in the direction of its movement through space (at over 130 kilometers per second).

== Observational methods ==
[[Image:PioneerH2011.jpg|thumb|Pioneer H, on display at the National Air and Space Museum, was a canceled probe to study the Sun.&lt;ref name="Pioneer-Swingby" /&gt;]]

=== Detection by spacecraft ===

The precise distance to, and shape of the heliopause is still uncertain. Interplanetary/interstellar [[spacecraft]] such as ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', ''[[Pioneer 11]]'', [[New Horizons]] and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' are traveling outward through the [[Solar System]] and will eventually pass through the heliopause. Contact to Pioneer 10 and 11 has been lost.

==== Cassini results ====

Rather than a comet-like shape, the heliosphere appears to be bubble-shaped according to data from [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini's]] Ion and Neutral Camera (MIMI / INCA).  Rather than being dominated by the collisions between the solar wind and the interstellar medium, the INCA ([[energetic neutral atom|ENA]]) maps suggest that the interaction is controlled more by particle pressure and magnetic field energy density.&lt;ref name="Cassini-shape-solar-system" /&gt;&lt;ref name="photojournal" /&gt;

==== IBEX results ====
[[File:IBEXmagneticfieldinfluence.jpg|thumb]]

Initial data from [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer]] (IBEX), launched in October 2008, revealed a previously unpredicted "very narrow ribbon that is two to three times brighter than anything else in the sky."&lt;ref name="IBEX-2009" /&gt;  Initial interpretations suggest that "the interstellar environment has far more influence on structuring the heliosphere than anyone previously believed"&lt;ref&gt;Oct.15/09 IBEX team announcement at http://ibex.swri.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;
"No one knows what is creating the ENA (energetic neutral atoms) ribbon, ..."&lt;ref name="Kerr-2009" /&gt;

"The IBEX results are truly remarkable! What we are seeing in these maps does not match with any of the previous theoretical models of this region. It will be exciting for scientists to review these ([[energetic neutral atom|ENA]]) maps and revise the way we understand our heliosphere and how it interacts with the galaxy."&lt;ref&gt;Dave McComas, IBEX Principal Investigator at http://ibex.swri.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, significant changes were detected in the ribbon after 6 months, based on the second set of IBEX observations.&lt;ref name=change&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/3634/the-ever-changing-edge-of-the-solar-system|title=Complete Archive for Astrobiology Press Release, News Exclusive, News Briefs|publisher=|date=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBEX data did not support the existence of a bow shock,&lt;ref name="No-Bow-Shock" /&gt; but there might be a 'bow wave' according to one study.&lt;ref name=zank/&gt;

=== Locally ===
[[File:Evolving Heliophysics System Observatory.jpg|thumb|Overview of [[Heliophysics]] spacecraft circa 2011]]

Of particular interest is the Earth's interaction with the heliosphere, but its extent and interaction with other bodies in the solar system have also been studied.
Some examples of missions that have or continue to collect data related to the heliosphere include ''(see also [[List of heliophysics missions]])'':
* [[Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer]]
* [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]]
* [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]]
* [[STEREO]]
* [[Ulysses (spacecraft)]]
*[[Parker Solar Probe]]

During a total eclipse the high-temperature corona can be more readily observed from Earth solar observatories. During the Apollo program the Solar wind was measured on the Moon via the [[Solar Wind Composition Experiment]]. Some examples of Earth surface based Solar observatories include the  [[McMath–Pierce solar telescope]] or the newer [[GREGOR Solar Telescope]], and the refurbished [[Big Bear Solar Observatory]]. (see also [[List of solar telescopes])

=== Timeline ===
* In 1992, Pioneer and Voyager probes detected Lyα radiation resonantly scattered by heliospheric hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas.|first=Hall, Doyle|date=1992|title=Ultraviolet resonance radiation and the structure of the heliosphere.|url=https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/186043?show=full|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As of March 2005, it was reported that measurements by the Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) instrument on board the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) have shown that the heliosphere, the solar wind-filled volume which prevents the Solar System from becoming embedded in the local (ambient) interstellar medium, is not [[axisymmetrical]], but is distorted, very likely under the effect of the local galactic magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Lallement-2005" /&gt;
* As of 2008, there is a previously unpredicted narrow ribbon of ENAs.&lt;ref name="IBEX-2009" /&gt;
* As of October 2009, the heliosphere may be bubble, not comet shaped.&lt;ref name="Cassini-shape-solar-system" /&gt;
* As of October 2010, significant changes were detected in the ribbon after 6 months, based on the second set of IBEX observations.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;
* As of June 2011, the heliosheath area is thought to be filled with magnetic bubbles (each about 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] wide), creating a "foamy zone".&lt;ref name=surprise&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/heliosphere-surprise.html|title=A Big Surprise from the Edge of the Solar System|first=Holly|last=Zell|date=7 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory helps explain [[in situ]] heliosphere measurements by the two Voyager probes.
* As of May 2012, IBEX data implies there is probably not a bow "shock".&lt;ref name="No-Bow-Shock" /&gt; 
* As of June 2012 at 119 AU&lt;!-- 11.1 billion miles (17.8 billion km)--&gt; Voyager 1 detected an increase in cosmic rays.&lt;ref name=rays/&gt;
* Between late August and early September 2012, Voyager 1 witnessed a sharp drop in protons from the sun, from 25 particles per sec in late August, to about 2 particles per second by early October.&lt;ref name="nbc-voyager" /&gt; It was later determined that it entered interstellar space on August 25, 2012.&lt;ref name="voyager-historic" /&gt;
*August 2018, long-term studies about the hydrogen wall by the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft confirmed results first detected in 1992 by the two [[Voyager program|''Voyager'' spacecraft]].&lt;ref name="GRL-20180807" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LS-20180809" /&gt;

'''High production volume chemicals''', also referred to as HPV chemicals, are produced or imported into the United States in quantities of 1 million pounds or 500 tons per year.&lt;ref name=EPA /&gt; In [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Member countries|OECD countries]], HPV chemicals are defined as being produced at levels greater than 1,000 metric tons per producer/importer per year in at least one member country/region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2004 OECD List of High Production Volume Chemicals Environment Directorate|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/55/38/33883530.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 March 2014|pages=143|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of HPV chemicals serves as an overall priority list, from which chemicals are selected to gather data for a [[screening Information Dataset|screening information dataset]] (SIDS), for testing and for initial [[hazard]] assessment.

==History==

===OECD countries including EU===
In 1987, member countries of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] decided to investigate existing chemicals. In 1991, they agreed to begin by focusing on High production volume (HPV) chemicals, where production volume was used as a [[surrogate endpoint|surrogate]] for data on occupational, consumer, and [[environmental exposure]].&lt;ref&gt;(OECD Council Acts, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Each country agreed to "sponsor" the assessment of a proportion of the HPV chemicals. Countries also agreed on a minimum set of required information, the [[Screening Information Dataset|screening information dataset]] (SIDS). Six tests are: [[acute toxicity]], [[chronic toxicity]], [[developmental toxicity]]/[[reproductive toxicity]], [[mutagenicity]], [[ecotoxicity]] and environmental fate.  Using SIDS and detailed exposure data OECD's [[High Production Volume Chemicals Programme]] conducted initial [[risk assessment]]s to screen and to identify any need for further work.

During the late 1990s, OECD member countries began to assess chemical categories and to use [[quantitative structure–activity relationship]] (QSAR) results to create OECD guidance documents, as well as a computerized QSAR toolbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History: From the HPV Chemicals Programme to the Cooperative Chemicals Assessment Programme|url=http://www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/risk-assessment/historyfromthehpvchemicalsprogrammetothecooperativechemicalsassessmentprogramme.htm| work=Chemical safety and biosafety; Assessment of chemicals|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the global [[chemical industry]], organized in the [[International Council of Chemical Associations]] (ICCA) initiative, offered to join OECD efforts. The ICCA promised to sponsor by 2013 about 1,000 substances  from the OECD's HPV chemicals list "to establish as priorities for investigation", based on "presumed wide dispersive use, production in two or more global regions or similarity to another chemical, which met either of these criteria". OECD in turn agreed to refocus and to "increase transparency, efficiency and productivity and allow longer-term planning for governments and industry". The OECD refocus was on initial [[hazard]] assessments of HPV chemicals only, and no longer extensive [[exposure assessment|exposure information]] gathering and evaluation. Detailed exposure assessments within national (or regional) programmes and priority setting activities were postponed as post-SIDS work.

===United States===
On October 9, 1998, [[EPA Administrator]] Carol Browner sent letters to the CEOs of more than 900 chemical companies that manufacture HPV chemicals, asking them to participate in EPA's voluntary testing initiative, the so-called "HPV Challenge Program". The [[Environmental Defense Fund]], the [[American Petroleum Institute]], and [[American Chemistry Council]] joined in the effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Production Volume (HPV) Challenge|url=http://www.epa.gov/chemrtk/pubs/general/basicinfo.htm#creation|work=Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention Pollution Prevention &amp; Toxics|publisher=EPA| accessdate=13 March 2014|date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== HPV chemical lists==
The OECD list of HPV chemicals keeps changing. A 2004 list of 143 pages contained 4,842 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2004 OECD List of High Production Volume Chemicals|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/55/38/33883530.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 March 2014|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 list was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2007 OECD List of High Production Volume Chemicals|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/9/43947965.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 March 2014|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of| 2009}} the EPA's HPV list had 2,539 chemicals, while the HPV Challenge Program chemical list contained only 1,973 chemicals because inorganic chemicals and polymers were not included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)|title=The HPV Voluntary Challenge Chemical List|url= http://www.epa.gov/hpv/pubs/update/hpvchmlt.htm|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA has published an online list of HPV chemicals since 2010. The list is not numerated and without footnotes.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|title=HPV Chemical Hazard Characterizations|url=http://iaspub.epa.gov/oppthpv/hpv_hc_characterization.get_report?doctype=2|work=High Production Volume Information System (HPVIS)|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=13 March 2014|date=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory context==

===Europe===
The "Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management" ([[SAICM]]) is a policy for achieving safe production and use of chemicals worldwide by 2020, developed with stakeholders from more than 140 countries, signed by 100 governments, adopted by the [[UNEP]] Governing Council in February 2006. 
The [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) proposal and the [[European Chemicals Agency]] will help the EU to fulfill objectives of SAICM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency and amending Directive 1999/45/EC and Regulation (EC) on Persistent Organic Pollutants|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/06/st15/st15315.en06.pdf|publisher=European Union|accessdate=14 March 2014|author=Council of the European Union|pages=756|date=14 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] has aimed to control production, use, trade, disposal and release of twelve [[Persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs); the European Community has proposed five additional chemicals. The Convention bans deliberate production and use of POPs, bans the development of new POPs, and aims at minimizing releases of unintentionally produced POPs. The Convention has so far been ratified by the European Community, 18 member states and the two accession countries.

===United States===
The 1976 [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] requires the EPA to "compile, keep current, and publish a list of each chemical substance that is manufactured or processed in the United States". In 1998, the EPA reported the most heavily used HPV chemicals in commerce were largely untested: 43% of 2,800 HPV chemicals had no basic [[toxicity test|toxicity data]] or screening level data at all, 50% had incomplete screening data, and only 7% of the HPV chemicals had a complete set of screening level toxicity data. However, screening level data, even if they indicated a problem, were not sufficient to restrict the use of a compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/hpv/pubs/general/hazchem.pdf|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|date=April 1998|title= Chemical Hazard Data Availability Study. What do we really know about the safety of high production volume chemicals? |author= Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1986, 2003, 2005, and in 2011 EPA issued regulations to amend and update the TSCA inventory.

As of April 2010, about 84,000 chemicals were on the TSCA inventory, per a [[GAO]] report.&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;{{cite web|title=TSCA Inventory Reset|url=http://www.epa.gov/champ/pubs/hpv/tsca.html|work=Chemical Assessment and Management Program (ChAMP)|publisher=EPA|accessdate=13 March 2014|date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; TSCA Section 4 gives EPA the authority to demand chemical testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemical Regulation: Observations on the Toxic Substances Control Act and EPA Implementation|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/655209.txt|work=GAO-13-696T|publisher=GAO|accessdate=13 March 2014|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity data==
In 1982, U.S. manufacturers, processors, and importers of 75 chemicals that the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] had found to cause cancers in animals, but the carcinogenicity of which in humans was uncertain, were surveyed. Only for 13 of the 75 chemicals had epidemiologic studies on human health been completed or were in progress. Eighteen of the 75 were HPV chemicals and only for eight HPV chemicals had epidemiologic studies been completed or were in progress. The largest number of chemicals (19) were drugs, and none of them had been epidemiologically studied. Seven chemicals that had been studied were used as pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Availability of epidemiologic data on humans exposed to animal carcinogens. II. Chemical uses and production volume|journal=Teratognesise Carcinogenesis Mutagenesis|year=1982| volume=2| issue=2|pages=151–67|pmid=6126936|author=Karstadt M |author2=Bobal R.| doi=10.1002/tcm.1770020205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] reported in “Toxic Ignorance” results of its analysis of the availability of basic health test data on HPV chemicals that only 29% of the HPV chemicals in the US met minimum data requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toxic Ignorance.|url=https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&amp;uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edf.org%2Fhealth%2Freports%2Ftoxic-ignorance|publisher=Environmental Defense Fund.|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=Summer 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1998 the EPA published a report CHEMICAL HAZARD DATA AVAILABILITY STUDY showing "55% of TRI chemicals have had full SIDS testing, while only 7% of other chemicals have full test data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=EPA’s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics|title=Chemical Hazard Data Availability Study: What Do We Really Know About the Safety of High Production Volume Chemicals?|publisher=EPA|pages=35|date=April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote 
"...of the 830 companies making HPV chemicals in the US, 148 companies have NO SIDS data available on their chemicals; an additional 459 companies sell products for which, on average, half or less of SIDS tests are available. Only 21 companies (or 3% of the 830 companies) have all SIDS tests available for their chemicals. The basic set of test data costs about $200,000 per chemical."
In 1999, the European Union (EU) published a study about how many EU-HPV chemicals were [[Publicly Available Specification|publicly available]] in a comprehensive chemical data base called [[IUCLID]]: Only 14% of the EU-HPV chemicals had data at the level of the base-set, 65% had less than base-set, and 21% had no data available. The authors concluded, "more data [were] publicly available than most previous studies" had shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=R Allanou |author2=BG Hansen |author3=Y van der Bilt |title=Public Availability of Data on EU High Production Volume Chemicals|journal=EUR| year=1999| issue=18996| publisher=European Union|url=http://www.chemicalspolicy.org/downloads/DataAvailabilityEUHPV.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, one of the partners in EPA's HPV Challenge Program assessed 532 up to then unsponsored chemicals, whether they were "orphaned" or not, and found:
* 156 chemicals (29%) likely were still "orphans" – i.e., they could and should be sponsored, but had not been
* 103 chemicals (19%) had an unclear status 
* 266 chemicals (50%) were likely no longer HPV
* only 7 chemicals (1%) appeared to be in the process of becoming sponsored.&lt;ref name=ED&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphan Chemicals in the HPV Challenge: A Status Report|url=http://www.environmentaldefense.org.|publisher=Environmental Defense|accessdate=14 March 2014|author1=Richard A. Denison |page=12|date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since 2009, the EPA required companies to perform toxicity testing on merely 34 chemicals. In 2011, the EPA announced, but as of 2013 had yet to finalize, plans to require testing for 23 additional chemicals, so altogether 57 chemicals. The EPA has prioritized 83 chemicals for [[risk assessment]], and initiated seven assessments in 2012, with plans to start 18 additional assessments in 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref name=GAO /&gt;
In 2007, EPA began Toxcast which uses "automated chemical screening technologies (called "high-throughput screening assays") to expose living cells or isolated proteins to chemicals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ToxCast™ Advancing the next generation of chemical safety evaluation|url=http://www.epa.gov/ncct/toxcast/|publisher=EPA|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=ToxCast Chemical Landscape: Paving the Road to 21st Century Toxicology|journal=Chemical Research in Toxicology|year=2016| volume=29| issue=8|pages=1225–1251|pmid=27367298|author=Richard A |author2=Judson R.| doi=10.1021/acs.chemrestox.6b00135}}&lt;/ref&gt;            

In 2009, EPA reported that it developed a system called ACToR (Aggregated Computational Toxicology Resource) to expose living cells or isolated proteins to chemicals.  It pooled chemical research, data and screening tools from multiple federal agencies including the National Toxicology Program/ National Institute of Environmental Health Science, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences and the Food and Drug Administration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2200">'''Hydrodenitrogenation''' ('''HDN''') is an industrial process for the removal of nitrogen from [[petroleum]].  Organonitrogen compounds, even though they occur at low levels, are undesirable because they cause poisoning of downstream catalysts.  Furthermore, upon combustion, organonitrogen compounds generate [[NOx]], a pollutant.  HDN is effected as general hydroprocessing, which traditionally focuses on [[hydrodesulfurization]] (HDS) because sulfur compounds are even more problematic.  To some extent, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is also effected.&lt;ref&gt;Topsøe, H.; Clausen, B. S.; Massoth, F. E., Hydrotreating Catalysis, Science and Technology, Springer-Verlag: Berlin, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical organonitrogen compounds in petroleum include [[quinoline]]s and [[porphyrin]]s and their derivatives.  The total nitrogen content is typically less than 1% and the targeted levels are in the ppm range. As described in [[organic geochemistry]], organonitrogen compounds are derivatives or degradation products of the compounds in the living matter that comprised the precursor to fossil fuels.  In HDN, the organonitrogen compounds are treated at high temperatures with [[hydrogen]] in the presence of a [[catalyst]], the net transformation being:&lt;ref&gt;Prins, Roel "Hydrotreating" Edited by Ertl, Gerhard From Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalysis (2nd Edition) (2008), 6, 2695-2718.  {{ISBN|978-3-527-31241-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   3 RH  +  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The catalysts generally consist of [[cobalt]] and [[nickel]] as well as [[molybdenum disulfide]] or less often [[tungsten disulfide]] [[catalyst support|supported]] on alumina]].  The precise composition of the catalyst, i.e. Co/Ni and Mo/W ratios, are tuned for particular feedstocks.  A wide variety of catalyst compositions have been considered, including metal [[phosphide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Oyama, S.

Under the administrative control of the [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)|Ministry of Commerce and Industry]], it is one of the smallest Central services under the Government of India.

== History ==
The organized and uniform collection of tax revenue on [[Table salt|salt]] in British India began under the [[British Raj]]. Both before and after that, various native rulers of the Indian [[Princely states]] (outside British India proper) collected such revenue in accordance with their own revenue and administrative requirements and resources. In 1856, the government appointed the young [[William Chichele Plowden]], Secretary of the Board of Revenue of the [[North West Provinces]], to report on the establishment of a uniform system of revenue realisation from salt within the British Provinces, and he recommended the extension of the [[Excise tax|excise]] system, the reduction of duty, and the introduction of a system of [[licensing]] as the measures to achieve this goal.&lt;ref name="saltcomindia"&gt;{{cite web|title=SALT ADMINISTRATION (PAST AND PRESENT)|url=http://saltcomindia.gov.in/HistoryOfSalt.html?tp=html|publisher=Office of Salt Commissioner, DIPP|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1876, separate departments under a Salt Commissioner were set up, and these operated at the level of each [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British Province and Presidency]]. It was with the passing of the [[Government of India Act, 1935]], that within British India (which then included much of present-day [[Pakistan]]) salt came under the exclusive control of the central government, with the Government of India taking over the task of collecting salt revenue and transferring it from the provincial salt agencies to the Central Excise and Revenue Department.&lt;ref name="saltcomindia" /&gt; In 1944, the Government of India passed the Central Excises and Salt Act which unified and amended all laws dealing with duties on excise and salt. In the 1940s and 1950s, after Independence, the Princely States were integrated into the new [[Union of India]], so that for the first time this service was extended to all of them.{{cn|date = May 2013}}

The Salt Department was originally a part of the Central Board of Revenue under the [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]], but since a reorganisation of the ministries of India in 1957 it has come under the authority of the [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)|Ministry of Commerce and Industry]].&lt;ref name="saltcomindia" /&gt;

According to the [[Union list in India|Union List]] of subjects under the [[Schedule VII|Seventh Schedule]] of the [[Indian Constitution]], the "manufacture, supply and distribution of salt by Union agencies; regulation and control of manufacture, supply and distribution of salt by other agencies", is the responsibility of the Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEVENTH SCHEDULE: List I—Union List|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/Const.Pock%202Pg.Rom8Fsss(35).pdf|publisher=Ministry of Law, Government of India|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  posts of Salt Controller, Deputy Salt Controller and Assistant Salt Controller were re-categorized as Salt Commissioner, Deputy Salt Commissioner and Assistant Salt Commissioner in 1952 and the Indian Salt Services were created in 1954 for the realisation of the entry under the Union List.&lt;ref name="saltcomindia" /&gt; The Salt Service has both Group A and Group B wings&lt;!--what does this mean?--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part I - Central Civil Services, Group 'A'|url=http://www.persmin.gov.in/DOPT/EmployeesCorner/Acts_Rules/ccs(cca)/SCHEDULE-1.PDF|publisher=Ministry of Personnel, Government of India|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PART II - Central Civil Services, Group 'B'|url=http://www.persmin.gov.in/DOPT/EmployeesCorner/Acts_Rules/ccs(cca)/SCHEDULE-2.PDF|publisher=Ministry of Personnel, Government of India|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Reid''' is the founder and president of the [[Conservation Strategy Fund]] (CSF), a nonprofit international environmental organization in located in [[Sebastopol, CA]]. John has worked in conservation since 1991, promoting the use of economics to address conservation challenges. Before founding CSF, he held positions with [[Resources for the Future]], [[Conservation International]] and [[Pacific Forest Trust]].&lt;ref name="live"&gt;http://live.csf.gotpantheon.com/en/profile/john-reid{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address the challenges inherent in conservation, John developed an innovative training program at CSF.&lt;ref name="live" /&gt; The program teaches conservationists how to use practical, policy-relevant analyses on a number of themes in the [[Amazon Rainforest]], [[Central America]] and the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. These themes include energy and transportation infrastructure, logging, ranching, protected areas and agriculture, among others.  He designed CSF as an independent technical organization with the aim of spreading economics skills among conservation professionals. John’s work has appeared in ''[[Scientific American]]'', ''[[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]]'', ''Environment'', the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', ''[[Megadiversidade]]'' and ''[[Ambio]]''.

[[File:Building straight up.jpg|thumb|KEVA Planks Tower]]
'''KEVA Planks''' are cuboid wooden [[Block (toy)|block toy]]s for children and adults.  Each block is sized approximately 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) x 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) x 4 1/2 inches (114.3 mm). The blocks are available for sale in [[Maple (wood)|maple]], that is produced in the United States, and less expensive imported [[pine]] versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KEVA planks Products|url=http://www.kevaplanks.com/page3/page3.html|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KEVA Planks started out as a simple construction set that is unusual because they only use one piece and no connectors in glue, in contrast to other building sets that often have specific instructions and require sorting. It has developed into a teaching tool used in classrooms and enjoyed in homes.

A number of museums have KEVA exhibits for hands on experience with design and construction including:

The '''Karrick process''' is a low-temperature [[carbonization]] (LTC) and [[pyrolysis]] process of carbonaceous materials. Although primarily meant for [[coal]] [[carbonization]], it also could be used for processing of [[oil shale]], [[lignite]] or any carbonaceous materials. These are heated at {{convert|450|°C|°F|abbr=on|-2}} to {{convert|700|°C|°F|abbr=on|-2}} in the absence of air to [[distillation|distill]] out [[synthetic fuel]]s–[[unconventional oil]] and [[syngas]]. It could be used for a [[coal liquefaction]] as also for a [[semi-coke]] production. The process was the work of oil shale technologist [[Lewis Karrick|Lewis Cass Karrick]] at the [[United States Bureau of Mines]] in the 1920s.

==History==
The Karrick process was invented by Lewis Cass Karrick in the 1920s. Although Karrick did not invent coal LTC as such, he perfected the existing technologies resulting the Karrick process.&lt;ref name=maynard&gt;

==Process==
The Karrick process is a low-temperature [[carbonization]] process, which uses a hermetic retort.&lt;ref name=handbook2/&gt;  For commercial scale production, a retort about {{convert|3|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|20|ft|m}} high would be used.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Superheated steam is injected continuously into the top of a retort filled by coal. At first, in contact with cool coal, the steam condenses to water acting as a cleaning agent. While temperature of coal rises, the [[destructive distillation]] starts.&lt;ref name=striner/&gt;  Coal is heated at {{convert|450|°C|°F|abbr=on|-2}} to {{convert|700|°C|°F|abbr=on|-2}} in the absence of air. The carbonization temperature is lower compared with {{convert|800|°C|°F|abbr=on|-2}} to {{convert|1000|°C|°F|abbr=on|-2}} for producing metallurgic coke.  The lower temperature optimizes the production of [[coal tar]]s richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar, and therefore it is suitable for processing into fuels.&lt;ref name=handbook2&gt;

The Karrick LTC process generates no [[carbon dioxide]], but it does produce a significant amount of [[carbon monoxide]].

==Products==
In the Karrick process, 1&amp;nbsp;[[short ton]] of coal yields up to 1&amp;nbsp;[[Barrel (volume)|barrel]] of oils and coal tars (12% by weight), and produces {{convert|3000|cuft|m3}} of rich [[coal gas]] and {{convert|1500|lb|kg}} of solid smokeless [[char]] or semi-coke (for one [[metric ton]], 0.175&amp;nbsp;m³ of oils and coal tars, 95&amp;nbsp;m³ of gas, and 750&amp;nbsp;kg of semi-coke).&lt;ref name=striner/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook2/&gt;  Yields by volume of approximately 25% [[gasoline]], 10% [[kerosene]] and 20% good quality [[fuel oil]] are obtainable from coal.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  Gasoline obtained from coal by the Karrick process combined with cracking and refining is equal in quality to [[tetraethyl lead]] gasolines.&lt;ref name=striner/&gt;&lt;ref name=stewart&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  More power is developed in internal combustion engines and an increase in fuel economy of approximately 20% is obtainable under identical operating conditions.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

Semi-coke can be used for utility boilers and coking coal in steel smelters, yields more heat than raw coal and can be converted to [[water gas]]. Water gas can be converted to oil by the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]].&lt;ref name=handbook2/&gt;  [[Coal gas]] from Karrick LTC yields greater [[energy density|energy content]] than [[natural gas]]. [[Phenol]]ic wastes are used by the chemical industry as feedstock for plastics, etc. Electrical power can be cogenerated at nominal equipment cost.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

==Economic viability==
Oils, including petroleum, have long been extracted from coal. Production plants were merely shut down in the 1880s because crude oil became cheaper than coal liquefaction. The capability itself, however, has never disappeared. Eight years of pilot plant tests by Karrick attest that states, cities or even smaller towns, could make their own gas and generate their own electricity.&lt;ref name=striner/&gt;

A 30-ton plant and oil refinery will show a profit over and above all operating and capital costs and the products will sell at attractive prices for equivalent products. The private sector should require no subsidies, but not in competition with those who skim off the oil from coal and sell the residual smokeless fuel to power plants.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

The cheapest liquid fuel from coal will come when processed by LTC for both liquid fuels and electric power.  As a tertiary product of the coal distilling process, electrical energy can be generated at a minimum equipment cost. A Karrick LTC plant with 1&amp;nbsp;kiloton of daily coal capacity produces sufficient steam to generate 100,000 [[kilowatt hour]]s of electrical power at no extra cost excepting capital investment for electrical equipment and loss of steam temperature passing through turbines.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt; The process steam cost could be low since this steam could be derived from off-peak boiler capacity or from turbines in central electric stations. Fuel for steam and superheating would subsequently be reduced in cost.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Compared to the [[Bergius process]], the Karrick process is cheaper, requires less water and destroys less the thermal value (one-half that of the Bergius process).&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;  The smokeless semi-coke fuel, when burned in an open grate or in boilers, delivers 20% to 25% more heat than raw coal.&lt;ref name=striner/&gt;  The coal gas should deliver more heat than natural gas per heat unit contained due to the greater quantity of combined carbon and lower dilution of the combustion gases with water vapor.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

The '''Kyshtym Disaster''' was a [[radioactive contamination]] accident that occurred on 29 September 1957 at [[Mayak]], a [[plutonium]] production site in Russia for [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear fuel reprocessing plant]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. It measured as a Level 6 disaster on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lollino et al.|2014}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pPdEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192 p. 192]&lt;/ref&gt; making it the third-most serious nuclear accident ever recorded, behind the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster]] (both Level 7 on the INES). The event occurred in [[Ozyorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast]], a [[closed city]] built around the [[Mayak]] plant, and spread [[hot particles]] over more than {{convert|20,000|sqmi}}, where at least 270,000 people lived.&lt;ref name="celannia2017"&gt;{{cite web |first= Grayson |last=Webb |date=12 Nov 2015 |title= The Kyshtym Disaster: The Largest Nuclear Disaster You've Never Heard Of |url= http://mentalfloss.com/article/71026/kyshtym-disaster-largest-nuclear-disaster-youve-never-heard |accessdate= 21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Ozyorsk/Mayak (named Chelyabinsk-40, then Chelyabinsk-65, until 1994) was not marked on maps, the disaster was named after [[Kyshtym]], the nearest known town.

==Background==
After [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Union]] lagged behind the US in development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, so it started a rapid research and development program to produce a sufficient amount of weapons-grade [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]]. The Mayak plant was built in haste between 1945 and 1948. Gaps in physicists' knowledge about nuclear physics at the time made it difficult to judge the [[nuclear safety|safety]] of many decisions. Environmental concerns were not taken seriously during the early development stage. Initially Mayak was dumping high-level radioactive waste into a nearby river, which flowed to the river [[Ob River|Ob]], flowing further down to the [[Arctic Ocean]]. All six [[nuclear reactor|reactors]] were on Lake Kyzyltash and used an open-cycle cooling system, discharging contaminated water directly back into the lake.&lt;ref name=whenTechFail&gt;{{harvnb|Schlager|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lake Kyzyltash quickly became contaminated, [[Lake Karachay]] was used for open-air storage, keeping the contamination a slight distance from the reactors but soon making Lake Karachay the "most-[[pollution|polluted]] spot on Earth".&lt;ref&gt;Lenssen, "Nuclear Waste: The Problem that Won't Go Away", Worldwatch Institute, Washington, D.C., 1991: 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Russia |author= Andrea Pelleschi |year=2013 |publisher= [[ABDO Publishing Company]] |isbn= 9781614808787}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="monterey"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/chelyabinsk-65_nuc.htm |title= Chelyabinsk-65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A storage facility for liquid nuclear waste was added around 1953. It consisted of steel tanks mounted in a concrete base, {{convert|8.2|meters}} underground. Because of the high level of radioactivity, the waste was heating itself through [[decay heat]] (though a [[chain reaction]] was not possible). For that reason, a cooler was built around each bank, containing 20 tanks. Facilities for monitoring operation of the coolers and the content of the tanks were inadequate.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuclear.tatar.mtss.ru/arxiv/332.htm |title= Conclusions of government commission |language= Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explosion==
In 1957 the cooling system in one of the tanks containing about 70–80 tons of liquid radioactive waste failed and was not repaired. The temperature in it started to rise, resulting in evaporation and a chemical explosion of the dried waste, consisting mainly of [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[acetate]]s (see [[ANFO|ammonium nitrate/fuel oil bomb]]). The explosion, on 29 September 1957, estimated to have a force of about 70–100 tons of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Kyshtym-disaster|title=Kyshtym disaster {{!}} Causes, Concealment, Revelation, &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; threw the 160-ton concrete lid into the air.&lt;ref name="official"/&gt; There were no immediate casualties as a result of the explosion, but it released an estimated 20&amp;nbsp;[[Mega-|M]][[curie|Ci]] (800&amp;nbsp;[[becquerel|PBq]]) of radioactivity. Most of this contamination settled out near the site of the accident and contributed to the pollution of the [[Techa River]], but a plume containing 2&amp;nbsp;MCi (80&amp;nbsp;PBq) of radionuclides spread out over hundreds of kilometers.&lt;ref name="kabakchi95"&gt;{{harvnb|Kabakchi|Putilov|1995|pp=46–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously contaminated areas within the affected area include the Techa river, which had previously received 2.75&amp;nbsp;MCi (100&amp;nbsp;PBq) of deliberately dumped waste, and [[Lake Karachay]], which had received 120&amp;nbsp;MCi (4,000&amp;nbsp;PBq).&lt;ref name="monterey"/&gt;

In the next 10 to 11 hours, the radioactive cloud moved towards the north-east, reaching {{cvt|300|-|350|km}} from the accident. The fallout of the cloud resulted in a long-term contamination of an area of more than {{cvt|800|to|20,000|km2}}, depending on what contamination level is considered significant, primarily with [[caesium-137]] and [[strontium-90]].&lt;ref name="monterey"/&gt; This area is usually referred to as the East-Ural Radioactive Trace (EURT).&lt;ref name="Dicus1Jan97"&gt;{{harvnb|Dicus|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evacuations==
At least 22 villages were exposed to radiation from the disaster, with a total population of around 10,000 people evacuated. Some were evacuated after a week, but it took almost 2 years for evacuations to occur at other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kostyuchenko|Krestinina|1994|pp=119–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Ecodefense Mayak Exhibition 17 Kyshtym Memorial.jpg |right|upright|thumb|Kyshtym Memorial]]

Because of the secrecy surrounding Mayak, the populations of affected areas were not initially informed of the accident. A week later (on 6 October 1957), an operation for evacuating 10,000 people from the affected area started, still without giving an explanation of the reasons for evacuation.

Vague reports of a "catastrophic accident" causing "radioactive fallout over the Soviet and many neighboring states" began appearing in the western press between 13 and 14 April 1958, and the first details emerged in the Viennese paper ''[[Die Presse]]'' on 17 March 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soran|Stillman|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryFrankland2014"&gt;{{cite book |author1= John Barry |author2= E. Gene Frankland |title= International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BXzsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 |date= 25 February 2014 |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 978-1-135-55396-8 |pages= 297}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was only in 1976 (18 years after) that [[Zhores Medvedev]] made the nature and extent of the disaster known to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Medvedev|1976}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JqEhtUjqORIC&amp;pg=PA264 pp. 264-7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Medvedev|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of verifiable information, exaggerated accounts of the disaster were given. People "grew hysterical with fear with the incidence of unknown 'mysterious' diseases breaking out. Victims were seen with skin 'sloughing off' their faces, hands and other exposed parts of their bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollock|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medvedev's description of the disaster in the ''[[New Scientist]]'' was initially derided by western nuclear industry sources, but the core of his story was soon confirmed by Professor Leo Tumerman, former head of the Biophysics Laboratory at the [[Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology]] in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;"The Nuclear Disaster They Didn't Want To Tell You About". Andrews Cockburn. ''Esquire Magazine''. 26 April 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The true number of fatalities remains uncertain because [[radiation-induced cancer]] is clinically indistinguishable from any other cancer, and its incidence rate can only be measured through epidemiological studies. One book claims that "in 1992, a study conducted by the Institute of Biophysics at the former Soviet Health Ministry in Chelyabinsk found that 8,015 people had died within the preceding 32 years as a result of the accident."&lt;ref name=whenTechFail /&gt; By contrast, only 6,000 death certificates have been found for residents of the Techa riverside between 1950 and 1982 from all causes of death,&lt;ref name=Standring /&gt; though perhaps the Soviet study considered a larger geographic area affected by the airborne plume. The most commonly quoted estimate is 200 deaths due to cancer, but the origin of this number is not clear. More-recent epidemiological studies suggest that around 49 to 55 cancer deaths among riverside residents can be associated to radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="Standring"&gt;{{harvnb|Standring|2009|pp=174–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would include the effects of all radioactive releases into the river, 98% of which happened long before the 1957 accident, but it would not include the effects of the airborne plume that was carried north-east.&lt;ref name="kellerer"&gt;{{harvnb|Kellerer|2002|pp=307–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area closest to the accident produced 66 diagnosed cases of [[chronic radiation syndrome]], providing the bulk of the data about this condition.&lt;ref name="Guskova2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Gusev|Gusʹkova|Mettler|2001|pp=15–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ozersk Broadway.jpg|thumb|[[Ozyorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast|Ozyorsk]] in 2008.]]

To reduce the spread of radioactive contamination after the accident, contaminated soil was excavated and stockpiled in fenced enclosures that were called "graveyards of the earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trabalka|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet government in 1968 disguised the EURT area by creating the [[East Ural Nature Reserve]], which prohibited any unauthorised access to the affected area.

According to Gyorgy,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gyorgy|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; who invoked the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] to gain access to the relevant [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) files, the CIA had known of the 1957 Mayak accident since 1959, but kept it secret to prevent adverse consequences for the fledgling American nuclear industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newtan|2007|pp=237–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1989 the Soviet government gradually declassified documents pertaining to the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuclear.tatar.mtss.ru/of280490.htm |title=The decision of Nikipelov Commission|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation==
The level of radiation in Ozyorsk itself, at about 0.1 mSv a year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Journal of Radiological Protection, December 2015, pp. 789-818 |language=English |pmid= 26485118 |doi= 10.1088/0952-4746/35/4/789 |volume=35 |issue=4 |journal= J Radiol Prot |pages=789–818 |last1= Suslova |first1= KG |last2= Romanov |first2= SA |last3= Efimov |first3= AV |last4= Sokolova |first4= AB |last5= Sneve |first5= M |last6= Smith |first6= G|year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is harmless, but the area of the EURT is still heavily contaminated with radioactivity.&lt;ref name="kellerer"/&gt;

The '''Lems''' was an English [[electric car]] manufactured by the London Electromobile Syndicate in London from 1903 to 1904.  The two-seater [[Runabout (car)|runabout]] claimed to run {{convert|40|mi|km}} on a single charge and reach a top speed of 12&amp;nbsp;mph (19&amp;nbsp;km/h). It was sold for 180 [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s.

In the [[United States]], there is an example of this car at [[Larz Anderson Auto Museum]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]].

[[File:Luz para Todos logo.png|thumb|right|The program logo]]
'''Luz para Todos''' ("Light for All") is a program of the [[Federation|Federal]] Government of [[Brazil]], launched in November 2003, with a goal of bringing [[electricity]] to more than 10 million rural people by the year 2008. It was initiated by [[Dilma Rousseff]], then [[Minister of Mines and Energy of Brazil]], operated by the large power utility company [[Eletrobras]], and executed by electricity [[Concession (contract)|concessionaires]] and [[cooperative]]s.&lt;ref name="TemasBlog"&gt;Keith R., [http://www.temasactuales.com/temasblog/environmental-protection/energy-the-environment/brazils-light-for-all-program-promotes-renewable-energy/ "Brazil’s Light for All Program Promotes Renewable Energy"] ''The Temas Blog'', 27 February 2009. Retrieved: 8 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project promotes [[renewable energy]] as the most practical solution in remote areas. To encourage utilizing that kind of energy, the federal government pays up to 85% of the costs for renewable energy projects in those areas.&lt;ref name="TemasBlog"/&gt;

During the program execution, more families without power at home were located, and the program was extended to be completed in 2010.&lt;ref name="OfficialSite"&gt;[http://luzparatodos.mme.gov.br/luzparatodos/asp/ "Programa Luz para Todos"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124085014/http://luzparatodos.mme.gov.br/luzparatodos/asp/ |date=24 November 2010 }} ''Ministry of Mines and Energy of Brazil'' – web site.

'''Mixed waste''' can refer to any combination of [[waste type]]s with different properties. 

Typically commercial and municipal wastes are mixtures of [[plastic]]s, [[metal]]s, [[glass]], [[biodegradable waste]] including [[paper]] and textiles along with other nondescript junk.

As defined by The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], 
Mixed Waste contains both hazardous waste (as defined by RCRA and its amendments) and radioactive waste (as defined by AEA and its amendments). It is jointly regulated by NRC or NRC's Agreement States and EPA or EPA's RCRA Authorized States. The fundamental and most comprehensive statutory definition is found in the Federal Facilities Compliance Act (FFCA) where Section 1004(41) was added to RCRA: "The term 'mixed waste' means waste that contains both hazardous waste and source, special nuclear, or byproduct material subject to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3784">In [[hydrology]], '''moisture recycling''' or '''precipitation recycling''' refer to the process by which a portion of the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitated]] [[water]] that [[evapotranspiration|evapotranspired]] from a given area contributes to the precipitation over the same area. Moisture recycling is thus a component of the [[hydrologic cycle]]. The ratio of the locally derived precipitation (&lt;math&gt;P_{L}&lt;/math&gt;) to total precipitation (&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;) is known as the '''recycling ratio''', &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\rho = P_{L}/P&lt;/math&gt;.

The recycling ratio is a diagnostic measure of the potential for interactions between [[Surface-water hydrology|land surface hydrology]] and regional [[climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koster|first1=R.|last2=Jouzel|first2=J.|last3=Suozzo|first3=R.|last4=Russell|first4=G.|last5=Broecker|first5=W.|last6=Rind|first6=D.|last7=Eagleson|first7=P.|title=Global sources of local precipitation as determined by the Nasa/Giss GCM|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=February 1986|volume=13|issue=2|pages=121–124|doi=10.1029/GL013i002p00121|bibcode=1986GeoRL..13..121K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trenberth|first1=Kevin E.|title=Atmospheric Moisture Recycling: Role of Advection and Local Evaporation|journal=Journal of Climate|date=May 1999|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1368–1381|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012&lt;1368:amrroa&gt;2.0.co;2|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012%3C1368:AMRROA%3E2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brubaker|first1=Kaye L.|last2=Entekhabi|first2=Dara|last3=Eagleson|first3=P.

The recycling ratio for the entire world is one, and for a single point is zero. Estimates for the recycling ratio for the [[Amazon basin]] range from 24% to 56%, and for the [[Mississippi river|Mississippi basin]] from 21% to 24%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterandclimate.org/MoistureWeb/Overview_Paper.htm Moisture recycling] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116022258/http://www.waterandclimate.org/MoistureWeb/Overview_Paper.htm |date=January 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of moisture recycling has been integrated into the concept of the [[precipitationshed]]. A precipitationshed is the upwind ocean and land surface that contributes evaporation to a given, downwind location's precipitation. In much the same way that a watershed is defined by a topographically explicit area that provides surface runoff, the precipitationshed is a statistically defined area within which evaporation, traveling via moisture recycling, provides precipitation for a specific point.

{{nihongo|'''Mokume-gane'''|木目金|Mokumegane}} is a Japanese metalworking procedure which produces a mixed-metal laminate with distinctive layered patterns, as well as that laminate itself. ''Mokume gane'' translates closely to "wood grain metal" or "wood eye metal" and describes the way metal takes on the appearance of natural wood grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Midgett|first=Steve|title=Mokume Gane A comprehensive study|year=2000|publisher=earthshine press|isbn=0-9651650-7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mokume gane fuses several layers of differently coloured precious metals together to form a sandwich of alloys called a "billet." The billet is then manipulated in such a way that a pattern resembling wood grain emerges over its surface. Numerous ways of working the mokume gane  create diverse pattens. Once the metal has been rolled into a sheet or bar, several techniques are used to produce a range of effects.&lt;ref name="BlogArticle"&gt;

Mokume-gane has been used to create many artistic objects. Though the technique was first developed for production of decorative sword fittings, the craft is today mostly used in the production of jewelry and hollowware.&lt;ref name="Andrew"&gt;

== History ==
===Origins===
First developed in 17th-century [[Japan]], mokume-gane was used for swords. As the customary [[Japanese swords|Japanese sword]] stopped serving as a weapon and became largely a status symbol, a demand arose for elaborate decorative handles and sheaths.&lt;ref name="Binnion2002"&gt;{{cite journal

To meet this demand, [[Denbei Shoami]] (1651–1728), a master metalworker from [[Akita Prefecture|Akita]] prefecture, invented the mokume gane process. He initially called his product ''guri bori'' for its simplest form's resemblance to ''guri'', a type of carved [[lacquerwork]] with alternating layers of red and black. Other historical names for it were ''kasumi-uchi'' (cloud metal), ''itame-gane'' (wood-grain metal), and ''yosefuki''.&lt;ref name="Pijanowski2001"&gt;{{cite journal

The early components were relatively soft metals and alloys (gold, copper, silver, [[shakudō]], [[shibuichi]], and [[kuromido]]) which would form liquid phase [[diffusion]] bonds with one another without completely melting. This was useful in the traditional techniques of fusing and soldering the layers together.&lt;ref name="Binnion2002"/&gt;

Over time, the practice of making mokume gane faded. The [[katana]] industry dried up in the late 19th century with [[Meiji Restoration]] returning ruling power to the emperor and the dissolution of the Shogunate government and the end of the Samurai class. The public display of swords as a sign of samurai status was outlawed. After this the few metalsmiths who practiced in mokume gane along with most other sword related artisans largely transferred their skills to create other objects.&lt;ref name="Andrew"/&gt;

===The West, 1877-===
[[Tiffany &amp; Co]].'s silver division under the direction of Edward C. Moore began to experiment with mokume gane techniques around 1877 and at the Paris exposition of 1878 Tiffany's in its grand prize-winning display of Moore's "Japanesque" silver wares included a magnificent "Conglomerate Vase" with asymmetrical panels of mokume gane. (The Conglomerate Vase which has been widely acclaimed as the most important work of nineteenth-century American silver was sold at Sotheby's on January 20, 1998 for $585,500.) Moore and Tiffany's silver smiths continued to develop its popular mokume techniques in preparation for the Paris exposition of 1889 where it displayed a vast array of Japanesque silver using ever more complex alloys of shakado, sedo and shibuci along with gold and silver to make laminates of up to twenty-four layers. Tiffany's display again won the grand prize for silver wares, and the company continued to produce its Japanesque silver with mokume up into the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loring|first=John|title=Magnificent Tiffany Silver|date=2001|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|isbn=0-8109-4273-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-21st century development===
By the mid 20th century, mokume gane was almost entirely unknown. Japan’s movement away from traditional craftwork, paired with the great difficulty of mastering the mokume gane art, had brought mokume gane artisans to the brink of extinction. It reached a point where only scholars and collectors of metalwork were aware of the technique.&lt;ref name="Binnion2002"/&gt; It was not until the 1970s, when Hiroko Sato Pijanowski who learned the craft from [http://galleryjapan.com/locale/en_US/artist/2472/ Norio Tamagawa.] Hiroko and her husband Eugene Pijanowski brought the craft of mokume gane back to the United States and began teaching it to their students, at this point the artform re-emerged in the public eye. 

Today, jewelry, flatware, hollowware, spinning tops and other artistic objects are made using this material.&lt;ref name="Andrew"/&gt;

Modern processes are highly controlled and include a compressive force on the billet. This has allowed the technique to include many nontraditional components such as [[titanium]], [[platinum]], [[iron]], [[bronze]], [[brass]], [[nickel silver]], and various colors of karat [[gold]] including yellow, white, sage, and rose hues as well as sterling silver.&lt;ref name="Binnion2002"/&gt; At the [http://www.santafesymposium.org/papers/ Santa Fe Symposium], a major annual gathering of jewelers from around the world, there have been several papers presented on new, more predictable, and more economic, methods of producing mokume gane materials, along with new possibilities for laminating metals such as the use of friction-stir welding.

===Liquid Phase Fusion (historic)===
Metal sheets were stacked and carefully heated; the solid [[Billet (manufacturing)|billet]] of simple stripes could be forged and carved to increase the pattern's complexity. Successful lamination using the traditional process requires a highly skilled smith with a great deal of experience. Bonding in the traditional process is achieved when some or all of the alloys in the stack are heated to the point of becoming partially molten (above solidus) this liquid alloy is what fuses the layers together. Careful heat control and skillful forging are required for this process.&lt;ref name="Binnion2002" /&gt;

===Soldering (brazing)===
In attempting to recreate the appearance of traditional mokume gane some artisans tried brazing layers together. The sheets were soldered using silver solder or some other brazing alloy. This technique joined the metals, but is difficult to perfect, particularly on larger sheets. Flux inclusions could be trapped or bubbles could form. Commonly, imperfections need to be cut out, and the metal re-soldered. Ultimately the brazed sheets do not display the ductility and work-ability of diffusion bonded material.

===Solid-state bonding (contemporary)===
The modernized process typically uses a controlled atmosphere in a temperature-controlled furnace. Mechanical aids such as a hydraulic press or torque plates (bolted clamps) are also typically used to apply compressive force on the billet during lamination. These provide for the implementation of lower temperature solid-state diffusion between the interleaved layers, thus allowing the inclusion of non-traditional materials.&lt;ref name="Binnion2002" /&gt;

== Development of the mokume pattern ==
After the fusion of layers, the surface of the billet is cut with chisel to expose lower layers, then flattened. This cutting and flattening process will be repeated over and over again to develop intricate patterns.&lt;ref name="Pijanowski2001"/&gt;

==Coloring==
To increase the contrast between the laminate layers many mokume-gane items are colored by the application of a [[patina]] (a controlled corrosion layer) to accentuate or even totally change the colors of the metal's surface.

===Niiro patination and rokushō===
One example of a traditional Japanese patination for mokume-gane is the use of the [[niiro]] process, usually involving [[rokushō]], a complex copper [[verdigris]] compound produced specifically for use as a patina. The piece to be patinated is prepared, then immersed in a boiling solution until it reaches the desired color, and each element of a compound piece may be transformed to a different color.  Historically, a paste of ground [[daikon]] radish was also used to prepare the work for the patina. The paste is applied immediately before the piece is boiled in the rokushō to protect the surface against tarnish and uneven coloring.&lt;ref name="Pijanowski2001" /&gt;

==Similar laminates==
In an accidental but parallel development, [[Sheffield plate]] was developed in England.  It follows a similar principal of bonded layers, without use of solder, but typically had 2–3 layers, whereas mokume-gane could have many more.

'''Montmorillonite''' is a very soft [[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|phyllosilicate]] group of minerals that form when they precipitate from water solution as microscopic [[crystal]]s, known as [[Clay mineral|clay]]. It is named after [[Montmorillon]] in [[France]]. Montmorillonite, a member of the [[smectite]] group, is a 2:1 clay, meaning that it has two [[tetrahedral]] sheets of [[silica]] sandwiching a central [[octahedral]] sheet of [[alumina]]. The particles are plate-shaped with an average diameter around 1 [[micrometer|μm]] and a thickness of 0.96 [[nanometer|nm]]; magnification of about 25,000 times, using an electron microscope, is required to "see" individual clay particles. Members of this group include [[saponite]].

Montmorillonite is a subclass of smectite, a 2:1 phyllosilicate mineral characterized as having greater than 50% octahedral charge; its cation exchange capacity is due to isomorphous substitution of Mg for Al in the central alumina plane. The substitution of lower valence cations in such instances leaves the nearby oxygen atoms with a net negative charge that can attract cations. In contrast, [[beidellite]] is smectite with greater than 50% tetrahedral charge originating from isomorphous substitution of Al for Si in the silica sheet.

The individual crystals of montmorillonite clay are not tightly bound hence water can intervene, causing the clay to swell. The [[water (molecule)|water]] content of montmorillonite is variable and it increases greatly in volume when it absorbs water. Chemically, it is hydrated sodium calcium aluminium magnesium silicate hydroxide (Na,Ca)&lt;sub&gt;0.33&lt;/sub&gt;(Al,Mg)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·''n''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Potassium, iron, and other cations are common substitutes, and the exact ratio of cations varies with source.  It often occurs intermixed with [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[muscovite]], [[illite]], [[cookeite]], and [[kaolinite]].

==Cave conditions==
Montmorillonite can be concentrated and transformed within [[cave]] environments. The natural weathering of the cave can leave behind concentrations of [[aluminosilicate]]s which were contained within the bedrock. Montmorillonite can form slowly in solutions of aluminosilicates. High HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations and long periods of time can aid in its formation. Montmorillonite can then transform to [[palygorskite]] under dry conditions and to halloysite-10Å ([[endellite]]) in acidic conditions (pH 5 or lower). Halloysite-10Å can further transform into [[halloysite]]-7Å by drying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Carol|author2=Paolo Forti|title=Cave Minerals of the World|publisher=[[National Speleological Society]]|year=1997|edition=Second|pages=177|chapter=Deposition and Stability of asdSilicate Minerals|isbn=1-879961-07-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Montmorillonite-en.svg|thumb|250px|Structure of montmorillonite]]
Montmorillonite is used in the [[oil well|oil drilling industry]] as a component of [[drilling mud]], making the mud slurry [[viscous]], which helps in keeping the drill bit cool and removing drilled solids.  It is also used as a [[soil]] additive to hold soil water in drought-prone soils, used in the construction of earthen dams and [[levee]]s, and to prevent the leakage of fluids.  It is also used as a component of [[Sand casting|foundry sand]] and as a [[desiccant]] to remove [[moisture]] from air and gases.

Montmorillonite clays have been extensively used in catalytic processes.  Cracking catalysts have used montmorillonite clays for over 60 years.  Other acid-based catalysts use acid-treated montmorillonite clays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Lawrie  |title=Handbook of Industrial Catalysts |year=2011 |publisher=Springer |location= New York|isbn=978-0387246826  |pages=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to many other clays, montmorillonite [[Expansive clay|swells]] with the addition of water. Montmorillonites expand considerably more than other clays due to water penetrating the interlayer molecular spaces and concomitant adsorption.  The amount of expansion is due largely to the type of exchangeable cation contained in the sample.  The presence of sodium as the predominant exchangeable cation can result in the clay swelling to several times its original volume.  Hence, sodium montmorillonite has come to be used as the major constituent in nonexplosive agents for splitting rock in natural stone quarries in an effort to limit the amount of waste, or for the demolition of concrete structures where the use of explosive charges is unacceptable.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=May 2014}}

This swelling property makes montmorillonite-containing [[bentonite]] useful also as an annular seal or plug for [[water wells]] and as a protective liner for [[landfills]].  Other uses include as an anticaking agent in animal feed, in paper making to minimize deposit formation, and as a retention and drainage aid component.  Montmorillonite has also been used in [[cosmetics]].{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=June 2012}}

In a fine powder form, it can also be used as a flocculant in ponds. Tossed on the surface as it drops into the water, making the water "clouded",  it attracts minute particles in the water and then settles to the bottom, cleaning the water.  Koi and goldfish (carp) then actually feed on the "clump" which can aid in the digestion of the fish. It is sold in pond supply shops.

Sodium montmorillonite is also used as the base of some cat litter products, due to its adsorbent and clumping properties.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=June 2012}}

===Calcined clay products===
Montmorillonite can be [[calcined]] to produce arcillite, a porous material. This calcined clay is sold as a soil conditioner for [[playing fields]] and other soil products such as for use as bonsai soil as an alternative to [[akadama]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Medicine and pharmacology===

Montmorillonite is effective as an [[Adsorption|adsorptive]] of [[Heavy metal (chemical element)|heavy metal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18319190|title=Adsorption of a few heavy|year=2008|last1=Bhattacharyya|first1=KG|last2=Gupta|first2=SS|volume=140|issue=2|pages=114–31|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2007.12.008|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For external use, montmorillonite has been used to treat [[contact dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16243136|title= A systematic review of contact dermatitis treatment and prevention|year=2005|last1=Saary|first1=J|last2=Qureshi|first2=R|last3=Palda|first3=V|last4=Dekoven|first4=J|last5=Pratt|first5=M|last6=Skotnicki-Grant|first6=S|last7=Holness|first7=L|volume=53|issue=5|pages=845|doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2005.04.075|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pet food===

Montmorillonite clay is added to some dog and cat foods as an anti-caking agent and because it may provide some resistance to environmental toxins, though research on the subject is not yet conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montmorillonite Clay Benefits, Uses in Cat / Dog Food, Structure &amp; Properties|url=http://durablehealth.net/montmorillonite/montmorillonite-clay-benefits-cat-dog-food-structure/|website=DurableHealth|accessdate=12 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104083730/http://durablehealth.net/montmorillonite/montmorillonite-clay-benefits-cat-dog-food-structure/|archivedate=4 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Montmorillonite was first described in 1847 for an occurrence in [[Montmorillon]] in the department of [[Vienne]], [[France]],&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; more than 50 years before the discovery of [[Bentonite#History and natural occurrence|bentonite]] in the US. It is found in many locations worldwide and known by other names.

==Lipid organization==
Montmorillonite is also known to cause [[micelles]] (lipid spheres) to assemble together into [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. These structures resemble cell membranes on many cells. It can also help [[nucleotides]] to assemble into [[RNA]] which will end up inside the vesicles.  This could have generated highly complex RNA polymers that could reproduce the RNA trapped within the vesicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-10/hhmi-cmh102203.php Clays May Have Aided Formation of Primordial Cells] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126233449/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-10/hhmi-cmh102203.php |date=2016-01-26 }} Howard Hughes Medical Institute, from EurekAlert!, American Association for the Advancement of Science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhmi.org/news/szostak3.html|title=Clays May Have Aided Formation of Primordial Cells|author=|date=|website=hhmi.org|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601212418/http://www.hhmi.org/news/szostak3.html|archivedate=1 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process may have played a part in [[abiogenesis]] which led to life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4307|title=Clay’s matchmaking could have sparked life|author=|date=|website=newscientist.com|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628094944/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4307|archivedate=28 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minerals similar to montmorillonites have also been found on [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2013/jun/07/nasa-mars|title=Nasa's Opportunity rover finds Martian water appropriate for the origin of life - Stuart Clark|first=Stuart|last=Clark|date=7 June 2013|website=the Guardian|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213090446/https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2013/jun/07/nasa-mars|archivedate=13 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pack goat''' is a [[goat]] used  as a beast of burden, for packing cargo.  Generally, large wether (castrated buck) goats are used for packing, though does may also be packed.&lt;ref name=pg.cWhyPack&gt;{{Citation|title=Goat packing Basics: Why pack a Goat?|url=http://www.packgoat.com/why-pack-a-goat/|accessdate=2010-07-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715032356/http://www.packgoat.com/why-pack-a-goat/|archivedate=2011-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While does are generally smaller and therefore  able to carry somewhat less cargo,&lt;ref name=pg.cWhyPack/&gt; they may also provide fresh milk.

Some public lands require permits for the use of goats as pack animals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Concerns have been raised about the disease-spreading potential that domestic goats may pose to wild animals, such as [[mountain sheep]] and mountain goats.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Accordingly, the use of pack goats is restricted in certain areas.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Goat packing was popularized in the U.S. in the 1980s and 1990s by John Mionczynski of [[Atlantic City, Wyoming]].  He developed a herd of large mixed-breed goats and used them as early as the 1970s to pack supplies for scientists working in the mountains and later to carry food and gear for tourists on [[hiking]] trips.  He designed and built customized [[pack saddles]] and [[saddlebags]]&lt;ref name=hup.cFAQ/&gt; and, with illustrator Hannah Hinchman, published a book, ''The Pack Goat'', in 1992.&lt;ref name=Mionczynski&gt;{{Citation|title=The pack goat |last1=Mionczynski |first1=John |last2=Hinchman |first2=Hannah |edition=illustrated, braille|publisher=Pruett Pub.

In mathematics, a '''pair of pants''' is a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] which is homeomorphic to the three-holed sphere. The name comes from considering one of the removed disks as the waist and the two others as the cuffs of a [[Trousers|pair of pants]].

Pairs of pants are used as building blocks for compact surfaces in various theories. Two important applications are to [[hyperbolic geometry]], where decompositions of [[closed surface]]s into pairs of pants are used to construct the [[Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates]] on [[Teichmüller space]], and in [[Topological quantum field theory]] where they are the simplest non-trivial [[cobordism]]s between 1-dimensional manifolds.

== Pants and pants decomposition ==

=== Pants as topological surfaces ===

[[File:Pants in the plane.png|thumb|A pair of pants as a plane domain (in blue, with the boundary in red)]]

As said in the lede a pair of pants is any surface which is homeomorphic to a sphere with three holes, which formally are three open disks with pairwise disjoint closures removed from the sphere. Thus a pair of pants is a compact surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] zero with three boundary components. 

The [[Euler characteristic]] of a pair of pants is equal to -1. Among all surfaces of negative Euler characteristic it has the maximal one; the only other surface with this property is the punctured torus (a [[torus]] minus an open disk).

=== Pants decompositions ===

[[File:Pants decomposition genus2.png|thumb|Two different pants decompositions for the surface of genus 2]]

The importance of the pairs of pants in the study of surfaces stems from the following property: define the complexity of a connected compact surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of [[Surface (topology)#Classification of closed surfaces|genus]] &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; boundary components to be &lt;math&gt;\xi(S) = 3g - 3 + k&lt;/math&gt;, and for a non-connected surface take the sum over all components. Then the only surfaces with negative Euler characteristic and complexity zero are disjoint unions of pairs of pants. Furthermore, for any surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and any [[simple closed curve]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; which is not [[Homotopy|homotopic]] to a boundary component, the compact surface obtain by cutting &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; has a complexity that is strictly less than &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In this sense pairs of pants are the only "irreducible" surfaces among all surfaces of negative Euler characteristic.

By an immediate recursion this implies that for any surface there is a system of simple closed curves which cut the surface into pairs of pants. This is called a ''pants decomposition'' for the surface, and the curves are called the ''cuffs'' of the decomposition. Of course there is no unicity in the decompositions obtained by this method, but by quantifying the argument one sees that all pants decomposition of a given surface have the same number of curves which is exactly the complexity.{{sfn|Ratcliffe|2006|loc=Theorem 9.7.1}} For connected surfaces a pants decomposition has exactly &lt;math&gt;2g - 2 + k&lt;/math&gt; pants.

A collection of simple closed curves on a surface is a pants decomposition if and only if they are disjoint, no two of them are homotopic and none is homotopic to a boundary component, and the collection is maximal for these properties.

=== The pants complex ===

[[File:Pants moves.png|thumb|Elementary moves between pants decomposition]]

A given surface has infinitely many distinct pants decompositions (we understand two decompositions to be distinct when they are not homotopic). One way to try to understand the relations between all these decompositions is the ''pants complex associated to the surface''.  This is a graph with vertex set the pants decompositions of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and two vertices are joined when they are related by an elementary move, which is one of the two following operations:
*take a curve &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the decomposition in a one-holed torus and replace it by a curve in the torus intersecting it only once ; 
*Take a curve &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the decomposition in a four-holed sphere and replace it by a curve in the sphere intersecting it only twice.

The pants complex is connected{{sfn|Hatcher|Thurston|1980}} (meaning any two pants decompositions are related by a sequence of elementary moves) and has infinite diameter (meaning that there is no upper bounds on the number of moves needed to get from one decomposition to the other). In the particular case when the surface has complexity 1, the pants complex is isomorphic to the [[Farey graph]]. 

The action of the [[mapping class group]] on the pants complex is of interest for studying this group. For example, Allen Hatcher and William Thurston have used it to give a proof of the fact that it is [[Finitely presented group|finitely presented]].

== Pants in hyperbolic geometry ==

===Moduli space of hyperbolic pants===

The interesting hyperbolic structures on a pair of pants are easily classified.{{sfn|Ratcliffe|2006|loc=Theorem 9.7.3}}

:''For every &lt;math&gt;(\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3) \in ]0, +\infty[&lt;/math&gt; there is a hyperbolic surface &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; which is homeomorphic to a pair of pants and whose boundary components are [[totally geodesic]] and of lengths &lt;math&gt;\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3&lt;/math&gt;. Such a surface is uniquely determined by the &lt;math&gt;\ell_i&lt;/math&gt;up to isometry. ''

By taking the length of a cuff to be equal to zero one obtains a complete metric on the pair of pants minus the cuff, which is replaced by a [[Cusp neighborhood|cusp]]. This structure is of finite volume.

=== Pants and hexagons ===

The geometric proof of the classification in the previous paragraph is important to understand the structure of hyperbolic pants. It proceeds as follows: given an hyperbolic pair of pants with totally geodesic boundary the three geodesic arcs joining the cuffs pairwise and which are perpendicular to them at their ends are uniquely determined, and are called the ''seams'' of the pants.

Cutting the pants along the seams one gets two right-angled hyperbolic hexagons which have three alternate sides of matching lengths. The following lemma can be proven with elementary hyperbolic geometry.{{sfn|Ratcliffe|2006|loc=Theorem 3.5.14}}

:''If two right-angled hyperbolic hexagons have each three alternate sides of the same length then they are isometric to each other.''

So we see that the pair of pants is the [[Double (manifold)|double]] of a right-angled hexagon along alternate sides. Since the isometry class of the hexagon is also uniquely determined by the lengths of the sides that were not glued the classification of pants follows from that of hexagons.

When a length of one cuff is zero one replaces the corresponding side in the right-angled hexagon by an ideal vertex.

=== Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates ===
{{Main article | Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates}}

A point in the Teichmüller space of a surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is represented by a pair &lt;math&gt;(M, f)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a complete hyperbolic surface and &lt;math&gt;f: S \to M&lt;/math&gt; a diffeomorphism.

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; has a pants decomposition by curves &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; then one can parametrise Teichmüller pairs by the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates which are defined as follows. The ''cuff lengths'' &lt;math&gt;\ell_i&lt;/math&gt; are simply the lengths of the closed geodesics homotopic to the &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''twist parameters'' &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt; are harder to define. They correspond to how much one turns when gluing two pairs of pants along &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt;: this defines them modulo &lt;math&gt;\ell_i\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;. One can refine the definition (using either analytic continuation{{sfn|Imayoshi|Taniguchi|1992|p=63}} or geometric techniques) to obtain twist parameters valued in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; (roughly, the point is that when one makes a full turn one changes the point in Teichmüller space by precomposing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with a [[Dehn twist]] around &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt;).

=== The pants complex and the Weil-Petersson metric ===

One can define a map from the pants complex to Teichmüller space, which takes a pants decomposition to an arbitrarily chosen point in the region where the cuff part of the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates are bounded by a large enough constant. It is a [[quasi-isometry]] when Teichmüller space is endowed with the [[Weil-Petersson metric]], which has proven useful in the study of this metric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Brock | first=Jeff | chapter=Pants decompositions and the Weil-Petersson metric | title=Complex Manifolds and Hyperbolic Geometry | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pairs of pants and Schottky groups ===

These structures correspond to [[Schottky groups]] on two generators (more precisely, if the quotient of the [[hyperbolic plane]] by a Schottky group on two generators is homeomorphic to the interior of a pair of pants then its convex core is an hyperbolic pair of pants as described above, and all are obtained as such).

== 2-dimensional cobordisms ==
{{Main article | Topological quantum field theory}}

[[File:Stef57 Cobordisme en dim 1.jpg|thumb|This [[Link (knot theory)|link]] cobordism between the [[Hopf link]] and the [[unlink]] is topologically a pair of pants.]]

A cobordism between two n-dimensional closed manifolds is a compact (n+1)-dimensional manifold whose boundary is the disjoint union of the two manifolds. The category of cobordisms of dimension n+1 is the category with objects the closed manifolds of dimension n, and morphisms the cobordisms between them (note that the definition of a cobordism includes the identification of the boundary to the manifolds). Note that one of the manifolds can be empty; in particular a closed manifold of dimension n+1 is viewed as an endomorphism of the empty set. One can also compose two cobordisms when the end of the first is equal to the start of the second. A n-dimensional topological quantum field theory (TQFT) is a monoidal functor from the category of n-cobordisms to the category of complex vector space (where multiplication is given by the tensor product).

In particular, cobordisms between 1-dimensional manifolds (which are unions of circles) are compact surfaces whose boundary has been separated into two disjoint unions of circles. Two-dimensional TQFTs correspond to [[Frobenius algebra]]s, where the circle (the only connected closed 1-manifold) maps to the underlying vector space of the algebra, while the pair of pants gives a product or coproduct, depending on how the boundary components are grouped – which is commutative or cocommutative. Further, the map associated with a disk gives a counit (trace) or unit (scalars), depending on grouping of boundary, which completes the correspondence.

'''Potential-induced degradation''' ('''PID''') is a potential-induced performance degradation in crystalline [[photovoltaic module]]s, caused by so-called stray currents. This effect may cause power loss of up to 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.en.csp.fraunhofer.de/news/details/id/857/ Fraunhofer CSP presents results of potential induced degradation (PID)] Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of the harmful leakage currents, besides the structure of the solar cell, is the voltage of the individual photovoltaic (PV) modules to the [[Ground (electricity)|ground]]. In most ungrounded PV systems, the PV modules with a positive or negative voltage to the ground are exposed to PID. PID occurs mostly at negative voltage with respect to the ground potential and is accelerated by high system voltages, high temperatures, and high humidity.

==History==
The term "potential-induced degradation" (PID) was first introduced in the English language in a published study by S. Pingel and coworkers in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the 35th IEEE PVSC 20–25 June 2010 pp. 2817-2822&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced as a degradation mode resulting from voltage potential between the cells in the photovoltaic module and ground.  Research in this field was pioneered by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, focusing primarily on electrochemical degradation in crystalline silicon &lt;ref&gt;http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/adv_tech/photovol/ppr_81-85/Pred%20Electrochem%20Breakdown%20-%20PVSC1984.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and amorphous silicon&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/adv_tech/photovol/ppr_81-85/Elechem%20Degr%20of%20a-Si%20Modules%20-%20PVSC1985.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; photovoltaic modules. The degradation mechanism known as polarization found in the first generation crystalline silicon high performance modules from SunPower in strings having positive voltage potential with respect to ground was discussed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;R. Swanson et.al. 15th PVSEC, Shanghai (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  Degradation of conventional  front junction (n+/p) solar cell modules under voltage potential was also observed.  The degradation by polarization was also covered in the trade journal Photon (4/2006, 6/2006, and 4/2007).

In 2007, PID was reported in a number of solar panels from [[Evergreen Solar]] (Photon 1/2008 and 8 /2008).  In this case, the degradation mechanism occurring in photovoltaic modules containing the more common front junction (n+/p) crystalline silicon solar cells when the modules were in negative voltage potential with respect to ground. PID was further discussed as a problem in ordinary crystalline modules (Photon 12/2010, lecture by solar energy company [[Solon SE]] at PVSEC in Valencia 2010). Statement of the solar module manufacturer [[Solon SE]]: ''"At 1000 V , a now quite common voltage for larger PV systems, it can be critical for each module technology"''. PID of the shunting type (PID-s), which is the most prevalent and most detrimental type of PID for crystalline silicon modules, was discovered to be caused by microscopic crystal defects penetrating the p-n front junction of affected solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Explanation of potential-induced degradation of the shunting type by Na decoration of stacking faults in Si solar cells|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024813003000|journal = Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date = 2014-01-01|pages = 383–389|volume = 120, Part A|doi = 10.1016/j.solmat.2013.06.015|first = Volker|last = Naumann|first2 = Dominik|last2 = Lausch|first3 = Angelika|last3 = Hähnel|first4 = Jan|last4 = Bauer|first5 = Otwin|last5 = Breitenstein|first6 = Andreas|last6 = Graff|first7 = Martina|last7 = Werner|first8 = Sina|last8 = Swatek|first9 = Stephan|last9 = Großer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
The PID-s that occurs in modules in negative polarity strings can be completely prevented if an [[inverter]] is used with the possibility of grounding (or effectively grounding) the positive or negative pole. This is possible if the inverter is [[Galvanic isolation|galvanically isolated]], e.g. using a [[transformer]], if specially designed transformerless inverter topologies are used, or by altering the electric grid potential to ground. Which pole must be grounded, is clarified with the solar module manufacturer.

==Reversal==
If the PID effect is present in the solar module, the effect can be reversed.  Five companies, [https://www.vigdu.com VIGDU], [[SMA Solar Technology]], [http://www.ilumen.be/en/pid.html iLumen], [http://padcon.de/en/products/pid-killer-plant-protection/pid-whats-that.html PADCON] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20160223110810/http://pidbull.com/en/ Pidbull] have made a device that can prevent and reverse this effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.sma.de/dl/15437/PVOFFSETBOX-DEN130824w.pdf SMA PV Offset Box] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222223620/http://files.sma.de/dl/15437/PVOFFSETBOX-DEN130824w.pdf |date=2014-02-22 }} SMA Solar Technology AG&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilumen.be/Datasheet_Ilumen_PID_Box_mini.pdf iLumen PID BOX mini] iLumen nv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://padcon.de/en/The_PID_solution_for_central_inverter.html?file=files/Padcon/Produkte/PID_KILLER/Float%20Controller%20CI%20Family/EN/Brochure%20PID%20KILLER.pdf PADCON PID KILLER] PADCON GmbH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pidbull.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/06/tech-datasheet-web-EN-2.pdf PID Solution for String Inverters] Pidbull NV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pidbull.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/06/tech-datasheet-central-EN.pdf PID Solution for Central Inverters] Pidbull NV&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[particle physics]], '''preons''' are [[point particle]]s, conceived of as subcomponents of [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s.&lt;ref name="D'Souza"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was coined by [[Jogesh Pati]] and [[Abdus Salam]] in 1974. Interest in preon models peaked in the 1980s but has slowed as the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics continues to describe the physics mostly successfully, and no direct experimental evidence for lepton and quark compositeness has been found.

In the [[hadron]]ic sector, some effects are considered anomalies within the [[Standard Model]]. For example, the [[proton spin crisis|proton spin puzzle]], the [[EMC effect]], the distributions of electric charges inside the [[nucleon]]s as found by [[Robert Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] in 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Robert |title=Electron Scattering and Nuclear Structure |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |date=1 July 1956 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=214–254 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.28.214|bibcode=1956RvMP...28..214H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofstadter |first1=R. |last2=Bumiller |first2=F. |last3=Yearian|first3=M.

When the term "preon" was coined, it was primarily to explain the two families of spin-½ fermions: leptons and quarks. More-recent preon models also account for spin-1 bosons, and are still called "preons". Each of the preon models postulates a set of fewer fundamental particles than those of the Standard Model, together with the rules governing how those fundamental particles combine and interact. Based on these rules, the preon models try to explain the [[Standard Model]], often predicting small discrepancies with this model and generating new particles and certain phenomena, which do not belong to the Standard Model.

==Goals of preon models==
Preon research is motivated by the desire to:
*Reduce the large number of particles, many that differ only in charge, to a smaller number of more fundamental particles. For example, the [[electron]] and [[positron]] are identical except for charge, and preon research is motivated by explaining that electrons and positrons are composed of similar preons with the relevant difference accounting for charge. The hope is to reproduce the [[reductionist]] strategy that has worked for the [[periodic table of elements]].
*Explain the three [[Generation (particle physics)|generation]]s of [[fermions]].
*Calculate parameters that are currently unexplained by the Standard Model, such as particle [[mass]]es, [[electric charge]]s, and [[color charge]]s, and reduce the number of experimental input parameters required by the Standard Model.
*Provide reasons for the very large differences in energy-masses observed in supposedly fundamental particles, from the [[electron neutrino]] to the [[top quark]].
*Provide alternative explanations for the [[electro-weak]] [[symmetry breaking]] without invoking a [[Higgs field]], which in turn possibly needs a [[supersymmetry]] to correct the theoretical problems involved with the Higgs field{{which|date=February 2016}}. Supersymmetry itself has theoretical problems{{which|date=February 2016}}.
*Account for [[neutrino oscillation]] and mass.
*Make new nontrivial predictions, such as [[cold dark matter]] candidates.
*Explain why there exists only the observed variety of particle species reproduce only these observed particles (since the prediction of non-observed particles is one of the major theoretical problems, as, for example, with [[supersymmetry]]).

==Background==
Before the Standard Model (SM) was developed in the 1970s (the key elements of the Standard Model known as [[quark]]s were proposed by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[George Zweig]] in 1964), physicists observed hundreds of different kinds of particles in [[particle accelerator]]s. These were organized into relationships on their physical properties in a largely ad-hoc system of hierarchies, not entirely unlike the way [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] grouped animals based on their physical features. Not surprisingly, the huge number of particles was referred to as the "[[particle zoo]]".

The Standard Model, which is now the prevailing model of particle physics, dramatically simplified this picture by showing that most of the observed particles were [[meson]]s, which are combinations of two [[quark]]s, or [[baryon]]s which are combinations of three quarks, plus a handful of other particles. The particles being seen in the ever-more-powerful accelerators were, according to the theory, typically nothing more than combinations of these quarks.

===Comparisons of quarks, leptons, and bosons===
Within the Standard Model, there are [[List of particles|several classes of particles]]. One of these, the [[quark]]s, has six types, of which there are three varieties in each (dubbed "[[Color charge|colors]]", red, green, and blue, giving rise to [[quantum chromodynamics]]).

Additionally, there are six different types of what are known as [[lepton]]s. Of these six leptons, there are three [[charged particle]]s: the [[electron]], [[muon]], and [[tau (particle)|tau]]. The [[neutrino]]s comprise the other three leptons, and for each neutrino there is a corresponding member from the other set of three leptons.

In the Standard Model, there are also [[boson]]s, including the [[photon]]s; [[W and Z bosons|W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and Z bosons]]; [[gluon]]s and the [[Higgs boson]]; and an open space left for the [[graviton]]. Almost all of these particles come in "left-handed" and "right-handed" versions (see '' [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]]''). The quarks, leptons, and W boson all have [[antiparticle]]s with opposite electric charge.

===Unresolved problems with the Standard Model===
The Standard Model also has a number of problems which have not been entirely solved. In particular, no successful theory of [[gravitation]] based on a particle theory has yet been proposed. Although the Model assumes the existence of a graviton, all attempts to produce a consistent theory based on them have failed.

Kalman &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalman |first=C. S. |journal=Nuclear Physics B: Proceedings Supplements|year=2005|volume=142|pages=235–237 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2005.01.042 |title=Why quarks cannot be fundamental particles |arxiv=hep-ph/0411313 |bibcode=2005NuPhS.142..235K}}&lt;/ref&gt; observes that, according to the concept of atomism, fundamental building blocks of nature are indivisible bits of matter that are ungenerated and indestructible. Quarks are not truly indestructible, since some can decay into other quarks. Thus, on fundamental grounds, quarks are not themselves fundamental building blocks but must be composed of other, fundamental quantities—preons. Although the mass of each successive particle follows certain patterns, predictions of the [[rest mass]] of most particles cannot be made precisely, except for the masses of almost all baryons which have been recently described very well by the model of [[Mario Everaldo de Souza|de Souza]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last1=de Souza |first1=M.E. |year=2010 |title=Calculation of almost all energy levels of baryons |journal=[[Papers in Physics]] |volume=3 |pages=030003–1 |doi=10.4279/PIP.030003 |url=http://www.papersinphysics.org/papersinphysics/article/download/64/pdf64
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Standard Model also has problems predicting the large scale structure of the universe. For instance, the SM generally predicts equal amounts of matter and [[antimatter]] in the universe. A number of attempts have been made to "fix" this through a variety of mechanisms, but to date none have won widespread support. Likewise, basic adaptations of the Model suggest the presence of [[proton decay]], which has not yet been observed.

===Motivation for preon models===
Preon theory is motivated by a desire to replicate the achievements of the periodic table, which reduced the elements to three building-blocks, and the later Standard Model which tamed the "particle zoo", by finding more fundamental answers to the huge number of arbitrary constants present in the Standard Model.

There are several models forward in an attempt to provide a more fundamental explanation of the results in experimental and theoretical particle physics, using names such as "parton" or "preon" for their basic particles. The particular preon model discussed below has attracted comparatively little interest to date among the particle physics community, in part because no evidence has been obtained so far in collider experiments to show that the fermions of the Standard Model are composite.

===Attempts===
A number of physicists have attempted to develop a theory of "pre-quarks" (from which the name ''preon'' derives) in an effort to justify theoretically the many parts of the Standard Model that are known only through experimental data. Other names which have been used for these proposed fundamental particles (or particles intermediate between the most fundamental particles and those observed in the Standard Model) include ''prequarks'', ''subquarks'', ''maons'',&lt;ref&gt;

However, in a recent work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Souza |first1=M.E. |year=2008 |title=Weak decays of hadrons reveal compositeness of quarks |journal=[[Scientia Plena]] |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=064801–1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; de Souza has shown that his model describes well all weak decays of hadrons according to selection rules dictated by a quantum number derived from his compositeness model. In his model leptons are elementary particles and each quark is composed of two ''primons'', and thus, all quarks are described by four ''primons''. Therefore, there is no need for the Standard Model Higgs boson and each quark mass is derived from the interaction between each pair of ''primons'' by means of three Higgs-like bosons.

In his 1989 [[Nobel Prize]] acceptance lecture, [[Hans Georg Dehmelt|Hans Dehmelt]] described a most fundamental elementary particle, with definable properties, which he called the ''[[cosmon]]'', as the likely end result of a long but finite chain of increasingly more elementary particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dehmelt |first1=H.G. |year=1989 |title=Experiments with an Isolated Subatomic Particle at Rest |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1989/dehmelt-lecture.html |work=Nobel Lecture |publisher=[[The Nobel Foundation]]}} See also references therein.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composite Higgs===
Many preon models either do not account for the [[Higgs boson]] or rule it out, and propose that electro-weak symmetry is broken not by a scalar Higgs field but by composite preons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Dugne |first1=J.-J. |last2=Fredriksson |first2=S. |last3=Hansson |first3=J. |last4=Predazzi |first4=E. |year=1997 |title=Higgs pain? Take a preon! |eprint=hep-ph/9709227}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Fredriksson preon theory does not need the Higgs boson, and explains the electro-weak breaking as the rearrangement of preons, rather than a Higgs-mediated field. In fact, the Fredriksson preon model and the de Souza model predict that the Standard Model Higgs boson does not exist.

==Rishon model==
{{Main|Rishon model}}
The ''[[rishon model]]'' (RM) is the earliest effort to develop a preon model to explain the phenomenon appearing in the [[Standard Model]] (SM) of [[particle physics]]. It was first developed by [[Haim Harari]] and [[Michael A. Shupe]] (independently of each other), and later expanded by Harari and his then-student [[Nathan Seiberg]].&lt;ref name=HarariSeiberg1984&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harari |first1=Haim |last2=Seiberg |first2=Nathan |url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/harari/files/Nuclear_PhysicsB_Vol204.pdf |year=1982 |title=The Rishon Model |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=204 |pages=141–167 |publisher=North-Holland Publishing |access-date=2018-06-02 |dead-url=no|bibcode=1982NuPhB.204..141H |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(82)90426-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model has two kinds of fundamental particles called '''rishons''' (which means "primary" in [[Hebrew]]). They are '''T''' ("Third" since it has an electric charge of ⅓&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|''e'']], or [[Tohu Rishon|Tohu]] which means [[Tohu va bohu|"unformed"]] in [[Book of Genesis|Hebrew Genesis]]) and '''V''' ("Vanishes",  since it is electrically neutral, or [[Vohu Rishon|Vohu]].  [Bohu means "void" in the Hebrew Tanakh (the Old Testament), though ''bohu'' may be pronounced as ''vohu'' by modern Israelis when the "b" is preceded by a vowel and thus lacks dagesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zionism-israel.com/dic/Pronunciation-Transliteration.htm |title=Hebrew - Alphabet, grammar, transliteration and pronunciation |work=The Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Zionism and Israel }}&lt;/ref&gt;] All [[lepton]]s and all [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]s of [[quark]]s are three-rishon ordered triplets. These groups of three rishons have [[spin-½]].

The [[Rishon model]] illustrates some of the typical efforts in the field. Many of the preon models theorize that the apparent imbalance of matter and antimatter in the universe is in fact illusory, with large quantities of preon-level antimatter confined within more complex structures.

==Criticisms==
===The mass paradox===
One preon model started as an internal paper at the Collider Detector at [[Fermilab]] (CDF) around 1994. The paper was written after an unexpected and inexplicable excess of jets with energies above 200&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|GeV]] were detected in the 1992–1993 running period. However, [[scattering]] experiments have shown that quarks and leptons are "pointlike" down to distance scales of less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m (or {{frac|1|1000}} of a proton diameter). The [[momentum]] [[uncertainty]] of a preon (of whatever mass) confined to a box of this size is about 200&amp;nbsp;GeV/c, 50,000&amp;nbsp;times larger than the [[rest mass]] of an up-quark and 400,000&amp;nbsp;times larger than the rest mass of an electron.

Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] states that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\Delta} x \cdot \operatorname{\Delta} p \ge \tfrac{1}{2}\hbar&lt;/math&gt; and thus anything confined to a box smaller than &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\Delta} x&lt;/math&gt; would have a momentum uncertainty proportionally greater. Thus, the preon model proposed particles smaller than the elementary particles they make up, since the momentum uncertainty &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\Delta} p&lt;/math&gt; should be greater than the particles themselves.

So the preon model represents a mass paradox: How could quarks or electrons be made of smaller particles that would have many orders of magnitude greater mass-energies arising from their enormous momenta? This paradox is resolved by postulating a large binding force between preons cancelling their mass-energies.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Conflicts with observed physics===
Preon models propose additional unobserved forces or dynamics to account for the observed properties of elementary particles, which may have implications in conflict with observation. For example, now that the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]]'s observation of a [[Higgs boson]] is confirmed, the observation contradicts the predictions of many preon models that did not include it.

Preon theories require that quarks and leptons should have a finite size. It is possible that the [[Large Hadron Collider]] will observe this when raised to higher energies.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1948 reprint/edit of his 1930 novel ''[[Skylark of Space|Skylark Three]]'', [[E. E. Smith]] postulated a series of 'subelectrons of the first and second type' with the latter being fundamental particles that were associated with the gravitation force. While this may not have been an element of the original novel (the scientific basis of some of the other novels in the series was revised extensively due to the additional eighteen years of scientific development), even the edited publication may be the first, or one of the first, mentions of the possibility that electrons are not fundamental particles.

* In the novelized version of the 1982 motion picture ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', written by [[Vonda McIntyre]], two of Dr. Carol Marcus' Genesis project team, Vance Madison and Delwyn March, have studied sub-elementary particles they've named "boojums" and "snarks", in a field they jokingly call "kindergarten physics" because it is lower than "elementary" (analogy to school levels).

* [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]]'s 1982 novel ''[[Voyage from Yesteryear]]'' discussed preons (called ''tweedles''), the physics of which became central to the plot.

[[Image:Rectification.svg|thumb|right|350px|Rectification of a sine wave produces pulsed DC.]]
'''Pulsed DC''' ('''PDC''') or '''pulsating direct current''' is a periodic current which changes in value but never changes direction. Some authors use the term '''pulsed DC''' to describe a signal consisting of one or more rectangular ("flat-topped"), rather than sinusoidal, pulses.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2 of "Introductory Signals and Circuits" by Jose B. Cruz, Jr. and M. E. Van Valkenburg, Blaisdell Publishing Company, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulsed DC is commonly produced from AC ([[alternating current]]) by a [[Rectifier#Half-wave rectification|half-wave rectifier]] or a [[Rectifier#Full-wave rectification|full-wave rectifier]]. Full wave rectified ac is more commonly known as '''Rectified AC'''. PDC has some characteristics of both [[alternating current]] (AC) and [[direct current]] (DC) waveforms.  The [[voltage]] of a DC wave is roughly constant, whereas the voltage of an AC waveform continually varies between positive and negative values. Like an AC wave, the voltage of a PDC wave continually varies, but like a DC wave, the sign of the voltage is constant.

Pulsating direct current is used on PWM controllers.

==Smoothing==
Most modern electronic items function using a DC voltage, so the PDC waveform must usually be smoothed before use. A [[reservoir capacitor]] converts the PDC wave into a DC waveform with some superimposed [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]].  When the PDC voltage is initially applied, it charges the capacitor, which acts as a short term storage device to keep the output at an acceptable level while the PDC waveform is at a low voltage.  Voltage regulation is often also applied using either [[linear regulator|linear]] or [[switching regulator|switching]] regulation.

== Difference from AC ==
Pulsating direct current has an average value equal to a constant (DC) along with a time-dependent pulsating component added to it, while the average value of alternating current is zero in steady state (or a constant if it has a DC offset, value of which will then be equal to that offset). Devices and circuits may respond differently to pulsating DC than they would to non-pulsating DC, such as a battery or regulated power supply and should be evaluated.

==Uses==
Pulsed DC may also be generated for purposes other than rectification.  It is often used to reduce [[electric arc]]s when generating thin [[carbon]] films,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astex.com/eni-rcsi-TN.html&lt;/ref&gt; and for increasing yield in [[semiconductor fabrication]] by reducing [[electrostatic]] build-up.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5249094.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also generated by the [[voltage regulator]]s in some [[automobile]]s, e.g., the classic air-cooled [[Volkswagen Beetle]].

[[Image:Band saw blades.jpg|thumb|250px|Resaw blades used in a [[sawmill]].]]

A '''resaw''' is a large [[band saw]] optimized for cutting timber along the grain to reduce larger sections into smaller sections or [[Wood veneer|veneers]]. Resawing veneers requires a wide blade – commonly 2 to 3 inches (52–78&amp;nbsp;mm) – with a small [[wikt:kerf|kerf]] to minimize waste. Resaw blades of up to 1 inch (26 mm) may be fitted to a standard band saw. Many small and medium-sized sawmills use 1- to {{frac|1|1|2}}-inch band saw blades.

[[Sawmill|Timber mills]] use larger resaws to rip large planks into smaller sizes. A typical mill sized resaw blade is eight inches wide and made with 16 gauge steel. Resaw blades can be identified by their straight back, as opposed to [[head saw|headsaws]] and doublecut blades, which have notched or toothed backs.

'''skyTran''' is a [[personal rapid transit|Personal Rapid Transit]] system concept first proposed by inventor [[Douglas Malewicki]] in 1990, and under development by Unimodal Inc. A prototype of the skyTran vehicle and a section of track have been constructed.

== System details ==
To minimize maintenance and make switching on and off the tracks efficient at high speeds, early versions of the system proposed using the [[Inductrack]] passive [[magnetic levitation]] system instead of wheels. Passive maglev requires no external power to levitate vehicles. Rather, the magnetic repulsion is produced by the movement of the vehicle over shorted wire coils in the track.&lt;ref name="LLNL" /&gt;  The cars would be driven by a [[Linear motor]] in the track or vehicle. Therefore, the system will have very few [[moving parts]]; primarily just the vehicle itself moving along the track, its parking wheels and door, and fans in heating and air conditioning units; so its promoters refer to the system as "solid state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerowebspace.com/AIAA/archives/SkyTran.pdf |title=Solid state |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216004602/http://www.aerowebspace.com/AIAA/archives/SkyTran.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this first version, the passive maglev coils are enclosed and supported by a light shell called a [[Automated guideway transit|guideway]] that also captures the vehicles mechanically to prevent derailment. Malewicki proposes a 3D grid design that avoids accident-prone intersections by [[grade separation]], with guideways and their exit and entry ramps crossing above or below each other. Tracks will be supported {{convert|20|or|30|ft|m|0}} above the ground by standard metal utility poles. They could also be attached to the sides of buildings.

After identifying problems with Inductrack and the cost associated with it, skyTran described an improved design during a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT1CjKtGFZs Horizon BBC interview with skyTran] at NASA Ames in Mountain View, CA.

New details about the levitation and motor were described in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rSvxeK4P4w keynote speech] in June 2016, showing levitation stator being plain aluminium plates and motor stator an aluminium tube. The guideway is also significantly enlarged and wider than the vehicle, so the switching can be vertical, going through the guideway. Guideway shape is shown at 16:26 in above referenced video. This new concept can be seen in a short [https://vimeo.com/165363771 simulation film].
Instead of the purely passive inductrack system, the new mechanism modify lift by mechanically angling the magnetic pads and need a servo controlled actuation. The lift control also do the switching by moving vertically through the rails.

Patents applications were filed by skytran for this new system:{{cite patent |country=US | number=20150329010 |status=application |url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=2015329010A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D#}} and {{cite patent |country=US |number=20140130703 | status=application |url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=2014130703A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D#}}

== History ==
Malewicki conceived the basic idea of skyTran in 1990, filing a US patent application that year that was granted as US Patent #5108052 in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=D329028.PN.&amp;OS=PN/D329028&amp;RS=PN/D329028

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He published several technical papers on skyTran in the following years.  In 1991, he presented a paper entitled "People Pods - Miniature Magnetic Levitation Vehicles for Personal Non-Stop Transportation" to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Future Transportation Conference in Portland, Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=People Pods - Miniature Magnetic Levitation Vehicles for Personal Non-Stop Transportation| first1=Douglas J.| last1=Malewicki| publisher=AeroVisions, Inc., and Monitoring Automation Systems| location=Irvine California, USA| first2=Frank J.| last2=Baker| date=June 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper is a thorough description of the concept at that point, although some important features of the current skyTran design are only discussed as options, including magnetic levitation rather than wheels and hanging below the guideway instead of riding above it.

The paper describes how Malewicki had built and driven a freeway-legal 154-MPG car in 1981, but realized it could never be safe on a street surrounded by far larger and heavier vehicles.  Elevated tracks would allow a very light vehicle to be safe. They are also basic to the system's inexpensiveness, because there is no need to acquire a huge right of way and tear down buildings. It presents an aerodynamic analysis (Malewicki is an aerospace engineer) supporting claims of very high energy efficiency (the paper claims {{convert|407|mpgus|mpgimp L/100 km||abbr=on|disp=or}} for skyTran's current two-passenger tandem design, though the Unimodal site claims only, "over {{convert|200|mpgus|mpgimp L/100 km|abbr=on|disp=or}}").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=People Pods| at=Table 2 "Performance Comparisons of Possible People Pod Concepts," page 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unimodal.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=37 |title=Benefits -- Energy Efficient |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122195758/http://www.unimodal.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=37 |archivedate=January 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also described how a very light vehicle that can squeeze both surfaces of a track simultaneously could reliably achieve a 6-G deceleration, allowing it to brake safely to a stop from {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0}} in just {{convert|55|ft|m|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=People Pods| at=Figure 7, "People Pod High 'g' Braking Capability," page 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 energy shortages stimulated renewed interest in [[Green vehicle]] proposals such as skyTran. The "Maglev skyTran" topic quoted a number of skyTran and [[Personal Rapid Transit]] ideas, such as passengers exiting and boarding at off-line elevated "portal" stops while high-speed traffic continues to speed by on its main line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/futurecity/plan.html |archive-date=June 17, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617124335/http://www.popsci.com/futurecity/plan.html |title=The Green MEGA CITY: An eco-savvy blueprint for tomorrow's megacity that points the way to fresh air, clean water and traffic that never jams -- Transportation -- Maglev skyTran  |date=June 13, 2008 |work=Popular Science Magazine |accessdate=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, the US [[NASA]] (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) signed a Space Act joint development agreement with Unimodal. Unimodal has tested prototype vehicles on short guideway sections at NASA's [[Ames Research Center]], in Mountain View, California. NASA control and vehicle dynamics simulation software was made available to Unimodal, which hired NASA subcontractors to program them using US DOT grant funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/nasalife/features/unimodal.html |title=NASA Partners to Revolutionize Personal Transportation |date=September 2, 2009 |last=Marlaire  |first=Ruth  |work=Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. |accessdate=June 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Unimodal and [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] (IAI) contracted to build a 400-500 meter elevated loop test track on IAI's campus in central Israel. If the pilot project is successful, IAI will build a commercial skyTran network in the city of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Herzliya]] and [[Netanya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.600947 |title=Israel's largest defense company to build world's first elevated transit network in Israel |date=June 24, 2014 |last=Rabinovitch |first=Ari |work=Haaretz |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/futuristic-skytrain-track-to-be-built-near-tel-aviv/ |title=Futuristic skytrain track to be built near Tel Aviv |date=June 24, 2014 |last=Winer |first=Stuart |work=The Times of Israel |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, Money transfer for the project in Herzliya was approved, which significantly promotes the project in Israel{{Citation needed|reason=|date=May 2018}}.

In 2018, it was announced that Indian conglomerate [[Reliance Industries]] had acquired a 12.7% stake in SkyTran.

A '''spin kit''' is a kit for a [[sailplane]] to make it [[spin (flight)|spin]]. The kit consists of [[ballast weight|ballast]] weights (usually discs) applied to the tail to move the center of gravity rearward. This increases the [[stability (aircraft)|instability]] of the glider, enabling it to spin.

A few sailplanes are very difficult, if not impossible, to spin under normal conditions. To make these sailplanes spin easily, for training purposes or demonstrations, a spin kit is available from the manufacturer.

'''''Vivian''''' was one of a series of severe [[hurricane]]s in 1990. It struck large parts of Europe from 25 to 27&amp;nbsp;February 1990 and cost 64&amp;nbsp;people their lives. A few days later it was followed by ''[[Hurricane Wiebke|Wiebke]]''. After [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992 (26.5&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;USD), ''[[Daria (hurricane)|Daria]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Hurricane Lothar|Lothar]]'' in 1999 (each costing c.&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;USD), and the [[West European Hurricane]] of 1987 (4.3&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;USD) ''Vivian/Wiebke'' was one of the most expensive Atlantic [[storm]]s in history, costing 4&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;[[US-Dollar|USD]] of insurance payments.&lt;ref&gt;''Natur- und Man-made-Katastrophen 2001: Man-made-Schäden einer neuen Dimension.'' In: ''sigma'' 1/2002, Schweizerische Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft, pS.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;
In his report ''Winter storms in Europe - History from 1703 to 2012'' (''Winterstürme in Europa - Historie von 1703 bis 2012''), Aon Benfield assessed the cost of insurance payouts for storm damage in Germany as 1.5 billion euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winterstürme in Europa.

== Area ==
Apart from Germany (15 deaths), other countries affected badly were the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]].

In [[Hamburg]] there were several successive [[storm surge]]s. Thanks to the storms, the [[Rosenmontag]] parade in [[Düsseldorf]] was postponed until May, whilst in [[Cologne]] it went ahead with high safety precautions.

Death toll: The fatalities are given as 64 persons, the damage is estimated as ca. 1.11 billion [[Euro|€]].

== Wiebke (storm) ==
* From 28 February to 1 March 1990
* In central Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)
* Death toll: 35 persons

[[File:Wiebke.jpg|thumbnail|left|Windthrow in a German forest]]
Particularly in mountain regions, a large number of trees were damaged. (Even complete [[spruce]] and [[beech]] [[Silviculture|stands/forests]]).
Hundreds of trees were bent or thrown like matches. Extrapolations go of 60 to 70 million cubic meters of extra "cut" wood by the storm, which corresponded to about twice the annual harvesting in Germany.

'''Telluropyrylium''' is an [[aromatic compound|aromatic]] [[heterocyclic compound]] consisting of a six member ring with five carbon atoms, and a positively charged [[tellurium]] atom.&lt;ref name=doddi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doddi|first1=Giancarlo|last2=Ercolani|first2=Gianfranco|title=Thiopyrylium, Selenopyrylium, and Telluropyrylium Salts|journal=Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry|date=1994|volume=60|pages=65–195|doi=10.1016/S0065-2725(08)60182-8|series=Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry|isbn=9780120207602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sugimoto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sugimoto|first1=Toyonari|title=Reactions of Pyrylium, Thiopyrylium and Selenopyrylium Salts and Their Application to Synthetic Utility|journal=Journal of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan|date=1981|volume=39|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.5059/yukigoseikyokaishi.39.1}}{{openaccess}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derivatives of telluropyrylium are important in research of infrared dyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Detty|first1=Michael R.|last2=O'regan|first2=Marie B.|title=Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds: Tellurium-Containing Heterocycles|date=1994|publisher=Wiley|pages=219–289|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470187937.ch4|chapter=Telluropyrylium Compounds|doi=10.1002/9780470187937.ch4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming and numbering==
Formerly it was named tellurapyrylium.  However this is misleading, as "tellura" indicates that tellurium substitutes for carbon atom, but actually tellurium is substituted for the oxygen atom in [[pyrilium]].&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt; In the Hantzsch-Widman  system it is called tellurinium. This is the name used by [[Chemical Abstracts]]. Replacement nomenclature would call this telluroniabenzene.&lt;ref name=doddi/&gt;

Numbering in telluropyrylium starts with 1 on the tellurium atom and counts up to 6 counter-clockwise on the carbon atoms. The positions adjacent to the chalcogen, numbered 2 and 6 can also be called α, the next two positions 3 and 5 can be termed "β" and the opposite carbon at position 4 can be called "γ".

==Occurrence==
Because telluropyrylium is a positively charged cation, it takes the solid form as a salt with non-nucleophillic anions like [[perchlorate]], [[tetrafluoroborate]], or [[hexafluorophosphate]].

==Properties==
The positive charge is not confined to the tellurium atom in telluropyrylium, but distributes on the ring in several resonance structures, so that the α and γ positions have some positive charge. A nucleophillic attack targets these carbon atoms.

The shape of the telluropyrylium molecule is not a prefect hexagon, as the bondlengths to the tellurium atom at about 2.068&amp;nbsp;Å compared to about 1.4&amp;nbsp;Å for the carbon-carbon bonds. The angle at the tellurium atom is laso reduced to about 94°, angles at the α and γ carbon atoms in the ring are about 122° and at the β positions 129°. The whole ring is bent so that it forms a boat shape with an angles of 8.7° on the Te-γ axis. (THis was measured in the crystal structure of tetraphenyl telluropyrylium-pyrylium monomethine fluoroborate.

==Related==
When the ring of telluropyrylium is fused with other aromatic rings larger aromatic structures such as tellurochromenylium, telluroflavylium, and telluroxanthylium result.

A '''thyratron''' is a type of [[gas-filled tube]] used as a high-power electrical [[switch]] and controlled [[rectifier]].  Thyratrons can handle much greater currents than similar hard-vacuum tubes. Electron multiplication occurs when the gas becomes ionized, producing a phenomenon known as  [[Townsend discharge]]. Gases used include [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor, [[xenon]], [[neon]], and (in special high-voltage applications or applications requiring very short switching times) [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=L.

In the 1920s, thyratrons were derived from early vacuum tubes such as the UV-200, which contained a small amount of argon gas to increase its [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]] as a [[radio]] signal detector; and the German LRS Relay tube, which also contained argon gas. Gas [[rectifier]]s, which predated vacuum tubes, such as the argon-filled General Electric "[[rectifier#Argon gas electron tube|Tungar bulb]]" and the [[Peter Cooper Hewitt|Cooper-Hewitt]] [[Mercury-arc valve|mercury-pool rectifier]], also provided an influence. [[Irving Langmuir]] and G. S. Meikle of GE are usually cited as the first investigators to study controlled rectification in gas tubes, about 1914. The first commercial thyratrons didn't appear until around 1928.

The term "thyristor" was derived from a combination of "thyratron" and "[[transistor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.roadrunner.com/~mathematikos/Etymology/thyristor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905132123/http://home.roadrunner.com/~mathematikos/Etymology/thyristor.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the 1960s thyristors have replaced thyratrons in most low- and medium-power applications.

==Description==
[[File:Thyratron Symbols.svg|thumb|Thyratron Symbols|Most commonly used symbols in U.S.A. and in Europe of a thyratron (variations are usually related to the representation of the filament and the cathode)]]

Thyratrons resemble [[vacuum tube|vacuum tubes]] both in appearance and construction but differ in behavior and operating principle. In a vacuum tube, conduction is dominated by [[Electron|free electrons]] because the distance between [[anode]] and [[cathode]] is small compared to the [[mean free path]] of electrons. A thyratron, on the other hand, is intentionally filled with gas so that the distance between anode and cathode is comparable with the mean free path of electrons. This means that conduction in a thyratron is dominated by [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] conductivity. Due to the high conductivity of plasma, a thyratron is capable of switching higher currents than vacuum tubes which are limited by [[space charge]]. A vacuum tube has the advantage that conductivity may be modulated at any time whereas a thyratron becomes filled with plasma and continues to conduct as long as a [[voltage]] exists between the anode and cathode. A [[pseudospark switch]] operates in a similar regime of the [[Paschen's law|Paschen curve]] as a thyratron and is sometimes called a [[cold cathode]] thyratron.

A thyratron consists of a [[hot cathode]], an anode, and one or more [[control grid|control grids]] between the anode and cathode in an airtight glass or ceramic envelope that is filled with gas. The gas is typically [[hydrogen]] or [[deuterium]] at a pressure of 300 to 500&amp;nbsp;m[[Torr]] (40 to 70&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]). Commercial thyratrons also contain a [[titanium hydride]] reservoir and a reservoir heater that together maintain gas pressure over long periods regardless of gas loss.

Conductivity of a thyratron remains low as long as the control grid is negative relative to the cathode because the grid repels electrons emitted by the cathode. Space charge limited electron current flows from the cathode through the control grid toward the anode if the grid is made positive relative to the cathode. Sufficiently high space charge limited current initiates [[Townsend discharge]] between anode and cathode. The resulting plasma provides high conductivity between anode and cathode and is not limited by space charge. Conductivity remains high until the current between anode and cathode drops to a small value for a sufficiently long time that the gas ceases to be [[ionization|ionized]]. This recovery process takes 25 to 75&amp;nbsp;μ[[second|s]] and limits thyratron repetition rates to a few&amp;nbsp;k[[Hertz|Hz]].

==Applications==
[[Image:Z806W.JPG|left|thumb|Rare Z806W ''relay tube'' used in elevators]]
[[File:Wynn-Williams Scale-of -Two Counter from the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge,UK.jpg|right|240px|thumbnail|[[C. E. Wynn-Williams#Prewar Research|Wynn-Williams's scale-of-two counter]] using thyratrons (with permission of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], [[University of Cambridge]], UK.)]]

Low-power thyratrons (''relay tubes'' and ''trigger tubes'') were manufactured for controlling incandescent lamps, electromechanical relays or solenoids, for bidirectional counters, to perform various functions in [[Dekatron]] calculators, for voltage threshold detectors in [[RC circuit|RC]] timers, etc. ''Glow thyratrons'' were optimized for high gas-discharge light output or even [[phosphor]]ized and used as self-displaying [[shift register]]s in large-format, crawling-text [[dot-matrix display]]s.

Another use of the thyratron was in [[relaxation oscillator]]s.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the plate turn-on voltage is much higher than the turn-off voltage, the tube exhibits [[hysteresis]] and, with a capacitor across it, it can function as a sawtooth oscillator. The voltage on the grid controls the breakdown voltage and thus the period of oscillation. Thyratron relaxation oscillators were used in [[power inverter]]s and [[oscilloscope]] sweep circuits.

One miniature thyratron, the triode 6D4, found an additional use as a potent [[Noise generator|noise source]], when operated as a diode (grid tied to cathode) in a transverse magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/137/6/6D4.pdf |title=''6D4 Miniature triode thyratron'' data sheet |publisher=[[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] |format=PDF |accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficiently filtered for "flatness" ("[[white noise]]") in a band of interest, such noise was used for testing radio receivers, servo systems and occasionally in analog computing as a [[hardware random number generator|random value source]].

The miniature RK61/2 thyratron marketed in 1938 was designed specifically to operate like a [[Triode|vacuum triode]] below its ignition voltage, allowing it to amplify analog signals as a [[Regenerative circuit|self-quenching superregenerative detector]] in [[radio control]] receivers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/138/r/RK61.pdf |title=''Subminiature gas triode type RK61'' data sheet |publisher=[[Raytheon|Raytheon Company]] |format=PDF |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the major technical development which led to the wartime development of radio-controlled weapons and the parallel development of [[radio-controlled models|radio controlled modelling]] as a hobby.&lt;ref name=Honnest-Redlich&gt;George Honnest-Redlich ''Radio Control for Models (1950)'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early television sets, particularly British models, used thyratrons for vertical (frame) and horizontal (line) oscillators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/british_american_comparison_prewar.html |title=Comparison of British and American Pre-1945 Sets |publisher=Early Television Museum of Hilliard OH |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medium-power thyratrons found applications in machine tool motor controllers, where thyratrons, operating as phase-controlled rectifiers, are utilized in the tool's armature regulator (zero to "base speed", "constant torque" mode) and in the tool's field regulator ("base speed" to about twice "base speed", "constant horsepower" mode). Examples include [[Monarch Machine Tool]] 10EE lathe, which used thyratrons from 1949 until solid-state devices replaced them in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lathes.co.uk/monarch/page2.html Lathes.co.uk, retrieved 2012 July 27&lt;/ref&gt;

High-power thyratrons are still manufactured, and are capable of operation up to tens of [[ampere|kiloamperes]] (kA) and tens of [[volt|kilovolts]] (kV). Modern applications include pulse drivers for pulsed [[radar]] equipment, high-energy [[gas laser]]s, [[radiotherapy]] devices, [[particle accelerator]]s and in [[Tesla coil]]s and similar devices. Thyratrons are also used in high-power [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[television]] [[transmitter]]s, to protect [[inductive output tube]]s from internal [[short circuit|short]]s, by grounding the incoming high-voltage supply during the time it takes for a [[circuit breaker]] to open and reactive components to drain their stored charges. This is commonly called a ''[[Crowbar (circuit)|crowbar circuit]]''.

Thyratrons have been replaced in most low and medium-power applications by corresponding semiconductor devices known as [[thyristor]]s (sometimes called [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s, or SCRs) and [[TRIAC|triac]]s. However, switching service requiring voltages above 20 kV and involving very short risetimes remains within the domain of the thyratron.

Variations of the thyratron idea are the [[krytron]], the [[krytron|sprytron]], the [[ignitron]], and the triggered [[spark gap]], all still used today in special applications, such as nuclear weapons (krytron) and AC/DC-AC power transmission (ignitron).

==Example of a small thyratron==
[[Image:885 Thyratron.jpg|thumb|upright|R.C.A. brand 885 Triode Thyratron]]
The ''885'' is a small thyratron tube, using [[xenon]] gas. This device was used extensively in the timebase circuits of early [[oscilloscope]]s in the 1930s. It was employed in a circuit called a [[relaxation oscillator]]. During [[World War II]], small thyratrons similar to the 885 were utilized in pairs to construct [[flip-flop (electronics)|bistable]]s, the "memory" cells used by early [[computer]]s and [[code breaking]] machines. Thyratrons were also used for [[phase angle]] control of [[alternating current]] (AC) power sources in [[battery charger]]s and [[light dimmer]]s, but these were usually of a larger current handling capacity than the 885. The 885 is a 2.5 volt, 5-pin based variant of the 884/6Q5.

The term "unchambered" means that there is no stone chamber within the stone enclosure. In Great Britain they are often known as non-megalithic long barrows or [[unchambered long cairn]]s.

These are not, however, [[megalith]]ic structures.

Neolithic monuments are an expression of the culture and ideology of neolithic communities. Their emergence and function are a hallmark of social development.&lt;ref&gt;J. Müller In: Varia neolithica VI 2009 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Megawal143.jpg|thumb|330px|Polish unchambered long barrow of a type found east of the Oder. Key: ''Einfassung'' = enclosure, ''Hügel'' = mound, ''Kulturschicht mit Pflugspuren'' = cultural layer with plough marks, ''Steinpackung'' = stone packing, ''Trennende Querreihe(n)'' = dividing row(s), ''Bestattungen'' = graves.]]

== Unchambered long barrows of the Funnelbeaker culture ==
In the region occupied by the peoples of the [[Funnelbeaker culture]] (TBK), unchambered long barrows fall into the megalith category because, in many cases, their generally very low mounds, which are located mainly along the lower reaches of the rivers [[Elbe]] ([[Unterelbe|Lower Elbe]]), [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]], have an enclosure of megaliths, about one metre high. Due to their small dimensions they were not suitable for constructing chambers, which is why there are no chambers made of large stone blocks. The enclosures (see [[Nordic megalith architecture]]) are trapezoidal or rectangular. East of the [[River Oder]] they are often trapezoidal or triangular with rounded tips, (Mound 9 at Sarnowo, near [[Konin]], [[Poland]]) mostly, however, without transverse walls (megalithic and non-megalithic) dividing them into separate chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=29147 |website=The Megalithic Portal |title=Sarnowo Long Barrows |accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of Kritzow ([[Ludwigslust-Parchim]]), has [[guardian stones]] higher than a man. Apart from the sites researched by [[Ewald Schuldt]] in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] in [[Megaliths of Gnewitz#Gnewitz 4 (no Spr.No.)|Gnewitz]], Rothenmoor and [[Megalith of Stralendorf|Stralendorf]] there are a further 11 in the area and five more examples in the forest of [[Sachsenwald]]. One group of three grave sites was first discovered in 1969 in the ''Alt Plestliner Holz'', [[Vorpommern-Greifswald]]. One of these enclosures is 80&amp;nbsp;metres long. Five unchambered barrows were investigated in the 19th century by J.&amp;nbsp;Ritter in the county of Hagenow.

All these sites are characterized by clearly defined mounds of stone (cobbles), which are covered beneath the mound with packed boulders. In the complex of Stralendorf ([[Ludwigslust-Parchim]] county) were six such mounds of cobbles, lying transversely and longitudinally, bounded by a 125-metre-long trapezoidal enclosure. Such mounds are sometimes found outside the enclosures or are found in or adjacent to barrows in which there are chambers, for example, in two of the four [[barrows of Grundoldendorf]]. The [[Alter Hau barrow#Alter Hau 1|barrow of Alter Hau]] in the forest of [[Sachsenwald]] has a length of 154 metres and is one of the longest sites in [[Nordic megalith architecture]].

The Tinnum long barrow (''Langbett von Tinnum'') on the island of [[Sylt]] is a long barrow that has neither a chamber nor a megalithic enclosure, but is constructed of stones about the size of a football. It clearly represents a transitional type.

If one considers sites without stone enclosures, whose mound had an enclosure of wooden posts in the past, of which there is now little trace, then the category of unchambered long barrows widens further, for example, to include the Tinnum long barrow, [[Barkjær]] (in [[Djursland]]) or [[Danica Nørremark]] (on Jutland). These so-called "Konens Høj type (Danish) or ''Niedźwiedź'' type graves (Polish) are especially common in the Funnelbeaker culture area east of the [[River Oder]].

== British Isles ==
The 200 or so British earthen long barrows were constructed with an enclosure of wooden posts. They are especially common in [[Wiltshire]] and [[Yorkshire]]. Three sites lie in [[Scotland]] and one on the [[Isle of Man]]. The barrows were formed over wooden chambers. In East Scotland there is another chamberless and non-megalithic variant: the "chamberless cairn", of which there are about 50&amp;nbsp;cairns without chambers. These only occur in England (12) in [[Cumbria]] and [[Northumberland]].

== France ==
The earth mounds or tumuli in Brittany are pre-megalithic, such as the ''tertres allongés'' in [[Landes (department)|Landes]] and [[Morbihan]]. They are low, slab-enclosed mounds, 15 to 35&amp;nbsp;metres wide and 40 to 100&amp;nbsp;metres long. They are rectangular or oval and contain dry walled internal structures for cremation ashes and [[grave goods]]. In the early megalithic period oversized earth mounds emerged, like the tumulus of Carnac, that has ciste-like elements. A newly discovered barrow of this type lies in [[La Trinité-sur-Mer]].

Barrows with enclosures of wooden posts (without stone) are the Middle Neolithic [[enclosures of the Passy type]], some of which are ascribed to the [[Cerny culture]]. This type of mound with wooden post or palisade enclosures are also found in the region of the early Funnelbeaker culture: the ''Konens Høj'' and ''Niedźwiedź'' type graves in Central Germany and Poland.

British, French and Nordic sites have no cultural connexion with one another at all.

'''Worldwide energy supply''' is the global production and preparation of [[fuel]], generation of electricity, and energy transport. Energy supply is a vast industry, powering the world economy. More than 10% of the world expenditures is used for energy purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardo-energy.org/blog/world-energy-expenditures|title=Energy expenditures|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all produced energy 80% is fossil. Half of that is produced by China, the United States and the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The Gulf States and Norway export most of their production, largely to the European Union and Japan where not sufficient energy is produced to satisfy their users. Energy production increases slowly, except for solar and wind energy which grows more than 20% per year.

[[File:Different energy forms (PES).png|thumb|Primary energy sources are transformed by the energy sector to generate energy carriers.]]

Produced energy, for instance crude oil, is processed to make it suitable for consumption by end users. The supply chain between production and final consumption involves many conversion activities and much trade and transport among countries, causing a loss of one third of energy before it is consumed.

Energy consumption per person in N-America is very high while in developing countries it is low and more renewable.&lt;ref name="balances" /&gt;

Worldwide carbon dioxide emission from fuel combustion was 32 gigaton in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/clasicstats/statisticssearch/report/?year=2015&amp;country=WORLD&amp;product=Indicators&lt;/ref&gt; In view of contemporary energy policy of countries the IEA expects that the worldwide energy consumption in 2040 will have increased more than a quarter and that the goal, set in the [[Paris Agreement]] about Climate Change, will not nearly be reached.

This is the worldwide production of energy, extracted or captured directly from natural sources. In [[Statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]] '''Primary Energy (PE)''' refers to the first stage where energy enters the supply chain before any further conversion or transformation process.

Energy production is usually classified as
* fossil, using [[coal]], [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]],
* nuclear, using [[uranium]],
* [[Renewable energy|renewable]], using [[hydro power]], [[biomass]], [[windpower|wind]] and [[solar energy]], among others.

Primary energy assessment follows certain rules&lt;ref group=note&gt;
Primary energy assessment:
* Fossil: based on [[lower heating value]].
* Nuclear: heat produced by nuclear reactions, 3 times the electric energy, based on 33% efficiency of [[nuclear plant]]s.
* Renewable:
** Biomass based on lower heating value.
** Electric energy produced by [[hydropower]], [[wind turbine]]s and [[solar panel]]s.
** [[Geothermal energy]] used in power plants is set at 10 times the electric energy, assuming 10% efficiency.
See [https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/statistics_manual.pdf IEA Statistics manual], chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; to ease measurement and comparison of different kinds of energy. Due to these rules uranium is not counted as PE but as the natural source of nuclear PE. Similarly water and air flow energy that drives hydro and wind turbines, and sunlight that powers solar panels, are not taken as PE but as PE sources.

The table lists the worldwide PE production and the countries/regions producing most (90%) of that.
The amounts are given in million tonnes of oil equivalent per year (1 Mtoe/a = 11.63 TWh/a = 1.327 GW).

Corresponding data are presented by the US Energy Information Administration expressed in quads. 1 quad = 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; [[BTU]] = 25.2 Mtoe. The US EIA follows different rules to assess renewable electricity generation. See [http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm EIA Glossary], Primary energy production.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary energy is converted in many ways to energy carriers, also known as secondary energy.
* Coal mainly goes to [[thermal power station]]s. [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] is derived by destructive distillation of bituminous coal.
* Crude oil goes mainly to [[oil refineries]], and is also used to make [[petroleum coke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Russia Oil Refining and Gas Processing Industry | publisher=International Business Publications, USA | series=Russia Oil Refining and Gas Processing Industry Handbook | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-7397-9236-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbFA27wsjREC&amp;pg=PA46 | access-date=May 31, 2017 | page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McKetta | first=J.J. | title=Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design: Volume 34 - Pentachlorophenol to Petroleum Fractions: Liquid Densities | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | series=Chemical Processing and Design Encyclopedia | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-8247-2484-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABrYesVa3S4C&amp;pg=PA464 | access-date=May 31, 2017 | page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Natural-gas goes to [[natural-gas processing]] plants to remove contaminants such as water, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, and to adjust the heating value. It is used as fuel gas, also in thermal power stations.
* Nuclear reaction heat is used in thermal power stations.
* [[Biomass]] is used directly or converted to [[biofuel]].

Electricity [[Electricity generation|generators]] are driven by

* [[Steam turbine|steam]] or [[gas turbine]]s in a [[thermal plant]],
* or [[water turbine]]s in a [[hydropower]] station,
* or [[wind turbine]]s, stand-alone or in a [[wind farm]].

The invention of the [[PV cell]] in 1954 started electricity generation by solar panels, connected to a [[power inverter]]. Around 2000 mass production of panels made this economic.

Much of primary and converted energy is traded among countries, about 5350 Mtoe/a worldwide, mostly oil and gas.
The table lists countries/regions with large difference of export and import.
A negative value indicates that much energy import is needed for the economy.
The quantities are expressed in Mtoe/a and the data are of 2015.&lt;ref name="balances" /&gt;

Big transport goes by [[tanker ship]], [[tank truck]], [[LNG carrier]], [[rail freight transport]], [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] and by [[electric power transmission]].

32% of primary production is used for conversion and transport, and 6% for non-energy products like lubricants, asphalt and [[petrochemicals]]. 62% remains for end-users.

'''Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES)''' indicates the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2017.pdf IEA KeyWorld2017, see Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; For the whole world TPES nearly equals primary energy PE but for countries TPES and PE differ in quantity and quality. Usually secondary energy is involved, e.g., import of an oil refinery product, so TPES is often not PE. P in TPES has not the same meaning as in PE. It refers to energy needed as ''input'' to produce some or all energy for end-users.

This is the worldwide consumption of energy by end-users. This energy consists of fuel (80%) and electricity (20%). The tables list amounts, expressed in million tonnes of oil equivalent per year (1 Mtoe = 11.63 TWh),  how much of these is renewable energy, and energy used per person per year in toe/a. Non-energy products are not considered here. The data are of 2015.&lt;ref name="balances" /&gt;

'''Fuel''':
* fossil: natural gas, fuel derived from petroleum (LPG, gasoline, kerosene, gas/diesel, fuel oil), from coal (anthracite, bituminous coal, coke, blast furnace gas).
* renewable: biofuel and fuel derived from waste.
* for [[District heating]].
The amounts are based on [[lower heating value]].

'''Electricity''':
* See [[Electric energy consumption]] (section World electricity consumption) for details, but note that the table there includes also internal consumption of power plants, about 10% of the totals.

The first table lists worldwide final consumption and the countries/regions which use most (83%). In developing countries fuel consumption per person is low and more renewable. Canada, Venezuela and Brazil generate most electricity with hydropower.

=== Energy for energy ===
{{main|Energy returned on energy invested}}
Some fuel and electricity is used to construct, maintain and demolish/recycle installations that produce fuel and electricity, such as [[oil platform]]s, uranium [[isotope separator]]s and wind turbines.
For these producers to be economic the ratio of '''[[energy returned on energy invested]]''' (EROEI) or '''energy return on investment''' (EROI) should be large enough.
There is little consensus in the technical literature about methods and results in calculating these ratios, but it is likely that for fuels (fossil and nuclear), hydro power and wind turbines the ratio is at least 10, for solar panels about 7 and for solar collectors (hot water) only 2.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Charles (2008). [http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3810  Table 1, EROI for the USA]. The Oil Drum. Retrieved May 31, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
In southern European countries solar EROEI exceeds ten&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=But What's the REAL Energy Return of Photovoltaic Energy? | website=Resilience | date=May 24, 2016 | url=http://www.resilience.org/stories/2016-05-24/but-what-s-the-real-energy-return-of-photovoltaic-energy/ | access-date=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more to the North it is less as it takes a greater part of the life time to regain the invested energy.

== Outlook until 2040 ==

Based on examination of '''Current Policies''' the IEA expects ''increasing strains on almost all aspects of energy security''.
Including new announced policies and targets the IEA estimates that to 2040 the global energy demand will have increased more than a quarter due to developing countries led by India. Renewable energy meets nearly 40% of this growth, oil and gas consumption rises by 50% and coal use will not grow. Global energy-related CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions increase slightly. The IEA calls this '''New Policies''' Scenario ''far out of step with what scientific knowledge says will be required to tackle climate change.''&lt;ref name="outlook"&gt;IEA World Energy Outlook 2018[https://webstore.iea.org/download/summary/190?fileName=English-WEO-2018-ES.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''Sustainable Development''' Scenario, overall primary energy demand in 2040 can be kept at today’s level by increasing efficiency. Renewable sources can increase their share to 30% half of which is solar and wind, nuclear increases to 10% by growth in Asia, natural gas increases slightly, oil peaks soon, coal declines immediately. Fossil fuels will meet 60% of total demand, down from 82% now. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission can reduce from 33 Mton in 2017 to 18 Mton in 2040 by capture and storage, decreasing methane emissions and eliminating flaring.
Global electricity generation can increase 40% to 36000 TWh (= 3200 Mtoe) of which 64% is renewable. The direct use of renewables (bioenergy, solar and geothermal heat) to provide heat and mobility can grow strongly. But the actions taken by governments will be decisive.&lt;ref name="outlook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IEA [https://www.iea.org/weo/] select Sustainable Development Scenario&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1781">A '''zolotnik''' (in [[Russian language|Russian]]: золотни́к; [[abbreviation|abbr.]]: zol.) was a small [[Russia]]n [[weights and measures|unit]] of [[weight]], equal to 0.1505 avoirdupois [[ounce]]s, or 4.2658 [[gram]]s (about 65.83 [[grain (measure)|grain]]s).  Used from the 10th to 20th centuries, its name is derived from the Russian word ''zoloto'', meaning [[gold]]. As a unit, the zolotnik was the standard for [[silver]] manufacture, much as the [[troy weight|troy ounce]] is currently used for gold and other [[precious metal]]s.

This unit was originally based on a [[coin]] of the same name.  The zolotnik circulated in the [[Kievan Rus]] until the 11th century; it was equal in weight to the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]].

==Relation to other units==

The Russian pound was known as the [[funt (mass)|funt]].  There were 96 zolotnik in a pound.  A smaller unit, the [[lot (unit)|lot]], was equal to three zolotnik.  There were 96 [[dolya]] in a single zolotnik.

The zolotnik was also used to measure [[fineness]] of precious metals (gold, silver, platinum). In this case, the ratio zolotnik/funt was meant, so one zolotnik meant 1/96. For example, 14-[[carat(purity)|karat]] (58.33%) gold was named "56-zolotnik gold" in Russia. As one karat means 1/24, one zolotnik is 1/4 karat.
