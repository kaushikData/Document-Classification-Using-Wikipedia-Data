The '''Abel Assessment for Sexual Interest''' (also '''Abel Assessment for Interest in Paraphilias''') is an assessment test that purports to measure sexual interest in various subjects – and especially to measure a tendency toward [[pedophilia]].&lt;ref name=Chammah&gt;{{cite web |first=Maurice |last=Chammah |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/the-sex-offender-test/397850/ |title=The Sex-Offender Test: How a computerized assessment can help determine the fate of men who've been accused of sexually abusing children |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=2015-07-09 |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test was created by [[Gene Abel|Dr. Gene G. Abel]] in 1995, and has been subsequently revised several times. It has been used as evidence in [[Northern America]] when prosecuting [[sex offender]]s, although its reliability has since been disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Statistical adequacy of the Abel Assessment for Interest in Paraphilias.|date=2014-01-24 |pmid=10497779 | volume=11 |journal=Sex Abuse |pages=195–205}} (abstract only; membership required for access to full text).&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been declared inadmissible in court in various [[jurisdiction]]s.

The Abel Assessment is controversial, because its results, although subjective, are presented as cut and dried. Some experts question its [[methodology]].&lt;ref&gt;United States of America v. Guy Randy White Horse (U.S. District Court, South Dakota Western Division 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Gillan MacLean (1998). "Testing the Reliability and Validity of the Abel Assessment". Department of Counseling and Special Education (Brigham Young University).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the test's uncertainty, [[mental health]] professionals have used the Abel Assessment to civilly commit sex offenders.

==History and testing method==
Dr. Gene Abel began researching sexual interest in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drgeneabel.com/install/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Abel-Assessment.pdf |title=The Leader in Science-based Tests for Sex Specific Evaluation &amp; Treatment |publisher=Drgeneabel.com |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214455/http://www.drgeneabel.com/install/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Abel-Assessment.pdf |archivedate=February 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that he previously used the [[penile plethysmograph]] before developing the Abel Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulstuckle.com/InformationCenter/ChildAbuse/ThePenilePlethysmograph.aspx |title=The Penile Plethysmograph in Sexual Assault Cases |publisher=Stuckle and Associates, PLLC |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Abel Assessment, the subject is shown a series of slides in two separate processes. The first measures each slide's viewing time, determining the subject's reaction vis-à-vis the mean reaction. If the subject's viewing time is longer than the mean, it is said that he has a sexual interest in the image shown. For example, if the subject looks at children in bathing suits for longer than average, the Abel Assessment shows him as having an interest in children.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

During the second process, the individual must rate the images from 1 to 7, with 1 being revolting and 7 being sexually exciting.

==Questions of validity==

The validity of the Abel Assessment has been questioned; it has struggled at times to pass the [[Daubert standard]] for admissibility in federal and [[State court (United States)|state court]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.atriumexperts.com/blogs/view/psychology-does-the-abel-assessment-of-sexual-interest-meet-the-daubert-criteria-for-evidence | title = PSYCHOLOGY: Does the Abel Assessment of Sexual Interest Meet the Daubert Criteria for Evidence? | accessdate = 2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Abel Assessment was found to be inadmissible in court cases in [[Massachusetts]], a ruling that was upheld by the [[Massachusetts Court of Appeals]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Charles Patrick |last=Ewing |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/jan06/jn.aspx |title=Judicial Notebook – Testing tool in question |publisher=Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, [[American Psychological Association]]|date= January 2006 |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of the test's methodology has been criticized. Abel is said to have exaggerated various statistics in order to prove his point. In the early 90s, he announced that he had figures suggesting sex offenders commonly have multiple [[paraphilia]]s. However, Marshall and Eccles found in 1991 that he had not mentioned that he had concentrated on any offender reporting multiple deviant acts as more than one person. This greatly increased his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childmolestationprevention.org/pdfs/study.pdf |title=The Abel and Harlow Child Molestation Prevention Study |publisher=Childmolestationprevention.org |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abel made this assertion from the results of the report "The Abel and Harlow Child Molestation Prevention Study". The report was never subject to [[peer review]] or published in any [[professional journal]]. There is also no in-depth detail about his methodology available. The Abel Assessment is based on these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frances |first=Allen |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/warning-sign-road-dsm-v-beware-its-unintended-consequences |title=A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM-V: Beware of Its Unintended Consequences |publisher=Psychiatric Times |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2014-02-17}} (membership required for access).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 decision on the admissibility of the test by Texas appellate judge Brian Quinn, the court said that since Abel's proprietary scoring methodology is not publicly known, it "could be mathematically based, founded upon indisputable empirical research, or simply the magic of young Harry Potter's mixing potions at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry".&lt;ref name=Chammah/&gt;

Abel states in his book that a therapist can use the test as a tool to determine if a child is attracted to other children. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled in 2004 that the Abel Assessment is a tool that is used only as [[Therapy|treatment]], and that it cannot detect whether a person has sexually abused children. Independent studies of the Abel Assessment have concluded it to be unreliable in adults and that there is not yet enough information to support its use with adolescents.

The Diana Screen is another test developed by Abel and his associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Micolucci | first =Vic | coauthors = | title =Test could be missing link in background checks | newspaper =[[WJXT|NBC 4 Jax]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =27 June 2013 | url = http://www.news4jax.com/news/does-new-test-prevent-child-sex-abuse/-/475880/20745492/-/i7cgnuz/-/index.html | accessdate =24 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It, too, has been a source of controversy for Abel due to it being a pass/fail test.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The '''Allard Prize for International Integrity''' is one of the world's largest prizes dedicated to the fight against corruption and the protection of human rights.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2017/09/29/news/oscars-anti-corruption-badass-women-lead-way|title=At the Oscars of anti-corruption, badass women lead the way|last=Uechi|first=Jenny|date=29 September 2017|work=National Observer|access-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is awarded biennially to an individual, movement or organization that has "demonstrated exceptional courage and leadership in combating corruption, especially through promoting transparency, accountability and the [[Rule of Law]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/prize-criteria|title=Prize Criteria|last=|first=|date=|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner receives the Allard Prize Award, a uniquely crafted brass artwork,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diatom.cc/allard-prize|title=Allard Prize Award Design|last=|first=|date=2013|website=Diatom Studio|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/award-design|title=Award Design|last=|first=|date=|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CAD$100,000. Honourable mention recipients are awarded a unique nickel-plated artwork, and may also receive a cash award.

At the 2017 Award Ceremony, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] stated that the Allard Prize “is important … and isn't devoted just to honouring anti-corruption crusaders, but to constructing and fortifying a framework that really does protect them and enables the work to proceed much more safely,"&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_DrKoWWW2A|title=2017 Allard Prize Keynote: Glenn Greenwald|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|date=28 September 2017|website=Allard Prize YouTube channel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "this kind of courage can be very contagious."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Past Allard Prize winners and others have said that the Allard Prize assists, supports and protects those working in anti-corruption and their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/indian-corruption-fighter-wins-ubcs-100k-integrity-award/|title=Indian corruption fighter wins UBC’s $100K integrity award|last=|first=|date=26 September 2013|work=Maclean's Magazine|access-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/7058-occrp-s-khadija-ismayilova-awarded-2017-allard-prize-for-international-integrity|title=OCCRP’s Khadija Ismayilova Awarded 2017 Allard Prize for International Integrity|last=|first=|date=29 September 2017|work=Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project|access-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/sites/default/files/rafael_marques_de_morais_letter_9_july_2017.pdf|title=Letter from Allard Prize Director + 11 others to Canadian Ambassador to Angola re Prosecution of Angolan Journalists Rafael Marques de Morais and Mariano Brás Lourenço|last=Barrett|first=Nicole|date=9 July 2017|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/news/allard-prize-international-integrity-calls-end-prosecution-rafael-marques-de-morais|title=Allard Prize for International Integrity Calls for End to Prosecution of Rafael Marques de Morais|last=Baker|first=Audrey|date=9 July 2017|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZArQlM93eM|title=The Allard Prize - An Introduction|last=|first=|date=31 May 2016|website=Allard Prize YouTube Channel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's [[National Observer (Canada)|National Observer]] calls The Allard Prize 'The Oscars of anti-corruption'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Prize is administered at the [[Peter A. Allard School of Law]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]].

Some Allard Prize nominees and winners have previously been subjected to threats, violence, torture, imprisonment and other attacks associated with their anti-corruption and human rights activities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One honourable mention recipient, Russian lawyer [[Sergei Magnitsky]], was nominated posthumously after being tortured to death in prison.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-trump-administration-sends-a-commendable-signal-to-despots-everywhere/2017/12/25/dc799340-e746-11e7-a65d-1ac0fd7f097e_story.html|title=The Trump administration sends a commendable signal to despots everywhere|last=|first=|date=25 December 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/recipient-and-honourable-mentions/sergei-magnitsky|title=Sergei Magnitsky|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomination and selection==
[[File:Allard Prize 2017 Operation Car Wash.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Political commentator [[Jimmy Dore]] of [[The Young Turks|TYT Network]] interviews members of Operation Car Wash at the 2017 Allard Prize ceremony.]]

The Allard Prize winner and any honourable mention recipients are chosen through a comprehensive nomination and selection process involving the Allard Prize Committee, sub-committees and an Advisory Board.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/process-nomination-and-selection|title=Process of Nomination and Selection|last=|first=|date=|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2015 Allard Prize, over 140 people were nominated from 50 countries. In 2017, the number of nominations grew to 244 from 70 countries, with 42 nominations (17 percent) from North America.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Nomination===
There are no restrictions as to who may submit a nominee for consideration. Nominations may come from anywhere including from members of the Allard Prize Committee. Self-nominations are allowed for both individuals and organizations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/frequently-asked-questions|title=Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominees range from neighbourhood activists to prominent world leaders, academics, social movements, political organizations and charitable groups.

Nominations are accepted on a rolling basis, with a new nomination cycle beginning with the announcement of finalists in the Prize year. Previously nominated candidates can be re-nominated, but new nomination forms must be submitted. There are no minimum or maximum age limits or any other limiting characteristics as to eligibility, with the exception that members of the Allard Prize Committee, Advisory Board and members of their immediate families may not be awarded the Allard Prize during their respective terms and for one year following the end of their terms.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Selection===
The Allard Prize Committee reviews all nominations and is responsible for selecting the Prize winner and any honourable mention recipients. The selection process involves research, subcommittees and due diligence, two levels of short-listing, and a requirement to submit short-listed of nominees to the Allard Prize Advisory Board for review and comment prior to the selection of the winner and honourable mention recipients.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Awarding the Prize==
The 2015 and 2017 Allard Prize public awards ceremonies were held at the University of British Columbia's Old Auditorium and were live-streamed over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4S1YenoyaY|title=Allard Prize 2015 Award Ceremony|last=|first=|date=|website=Allard Prize YouTube Channel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOGJR9KrPnQ|title=Allard Prize for International Integrity 2017 Award Ceremony|last=|first=|date=|website=Allard Prize YouTube Channel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of Allard Prize 'finalists' is released approximately one month prior to the Prize Ceremony. The public announcement identifying the Allard Prize winner is made at the Prize Ceremony, typically held in September or October of the award year. Finalists attend the ceremony in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and become part of the growing Allard Prize anti-corruption network.

== Controversies ==

=== Protest against selection of finalist Operação Lava Jato (Brazil - Car Wash Task Force) - 2017 ===
The selection of Brazil's Car Wash Task Force (Operação Lava Jato) as a 2017 Allard Prize finalist triggered objections in Brazil and Canada. A group of Brazilian lawyers wrote to the Allard Prize Committee demanding the Committee rescind their finalist status and alleging "numerous abuses, arbitrariness and legal violations" by the Task Force. A group of University of British Columbia faculty and students supported the Brazilian lawyer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/news/973391/barristers-object-nomination-controversial-brazil-anti-corruption-squad-ubc-prize|title=Barristers object to nomination of controversial Brazil anti-corruption squad for UBC prize|last=Pablo|first=Carlito|date=28 September 2017|work=The Georgia Straight|access-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During the September 28, 2017 Prize Ceremony, several audience members made vocal outbursts against the Car Wash Task Force.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In response, 2017 Allard Prize keynote speaker Glenn Greenwald said in his keynote address that while the Operation Car Wash Task Force had made some mistakes, powerful investigative work often creates controversy and enemies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In a post-award open discussion at the Allard School of Law, opponents confronted the Task Force's lead prosecutor [[Deltan Dallagnol]] with their criticisms, who responded during a recorded video session.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekjLkNuND_Y|title=2017 Allard Prize Finalist Q&amp;A Session|last=|first=|date=14 October 2017|website=Allard Prize YouTube channel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegation of Third World Bias ===
Shortly after the 2017 Allard Prize finalists were announced, journalist Russell Mokhiber noted in an article published in Corporate Crime Reporter that the Allard Prize has "a bias in favour of anti-corruption fighters in the Third World" rather than selecting nominees from Western developed countries. Mokhiber speculated that the bias might be due to a heavy representation of corporate lawyers, World Bank and Asian Development Bank personnel on the selection and advisory committees. In an interview with Mokhiber, Allard Prize Executive Director Nicole Barrett acknowledged that none of the previous finalists have been from North America. Noting that the majority of nominees are from the developing world, she said that the Allard Prize may consider developing a formal requirement of geographical balance to address this concern.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13961">{{Professional responsibility}}
The '''ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct''', created by the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA), are a set of rules that prescribe baseline standards of [[legal ethics]] and [[professional responsibility]] for [[lawyer]]s in the [[United States]]. They were promulgated by the ABA House of Delegates upon the recommendation of the Kutak Commission in 1983. The rules are merely recommendations, or models, (hence the name "Model Rules") and are not themselves binding. However, having a common set of Model Rules facilitates a common discourse on legal ethics, and simplifies professional responsibility training as well as the day-to-day application of such rules. {{As of|2015}}, 49 [[U.S. state|states]] and four [[U.S. Territory|territories]] have adopted the rules in whole or in part, of which the most recent to do so was the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]] in March 2015. [[California]] is the only state that has not adopted the ABA Model Rules, while [[Puerto Rico]] is the only U.S. jurisdiction outside of confederation has not adopted them but instead has its own ''Código de Ética Profesional''.

== State, commonwealth and territorial adoptions of the Rules ==

The [[American Bar Association]] is a private sector voluntary [[professional association]].  As such, it has no lawmaking power or regulatory authority, but it is just like any other nongovernmental [[bar association]]. Accordingly, the Model Rules are not legally binding on ABA members or within any particular jurisdiction. However, the Model Rules have been adopted, in whole or in part, and sometimes in variation, as the rules of professional conduct for attorneys in 49 states, the District of Columbia, and four of the five inhabited U.S. territories.  The rules of professional conduct or professional responsibility adopted in a particular state ''are'' legally enforceable against the lawyers of that state as well as any lawyer practicing there on a ''[[pro hac vice]]'' basis.

On December 17, 2008, New York announced that it would finally abandon the old [[American Bar Association Model Code of Professional Responsibility|ABA Model ''Code'' of Professional Responsibility]] (the last state to do so) and adopt a heavily modified version of the ABA Model ''Rules'', effective April 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/press/pr2008_7.shtml Press Release: New Attorney Rules of Professional Conduct Announced], Communications Office of the New York Courts, 17 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; New York's version of the Model Rules was created by adjusting the standard Model Rules to reflect indigenous New York rules that had been incorporated over the years into its version of the Model Code. Even though New York did not adopt the Model Rules verbatim, the advantage of adopting its overall structure is that it simplifies the professional responsibility training of New York lawyers, and makes it easier for out-of-state lawyers to conform their conduct to New York rules by simply comparing their home state's version of the Model Rules to New York's version.

In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Maine approved the adoption of the Model Rules in that state, effective August 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mebaroverseers.org/attorney_regulation/maine_conduct_rules.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213135802/http://www.mebaroverseers.org/attorney_regulation/maine_conduct_rules.html |archive-date=2015-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the portions of the Model Rules that the Maine Rules of Professional Conduct do not include is Model Rule 1.8(j) (2002) categorically prohibiting sexual relations between lawyer and client.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/index.php?topic=mebar_overseers_bar_rules&amp;id=88185&amp;v=article&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands adopted its current ''Rules of Attorney Discipline and Procedure,'' which incorporates the ABA Model Rules by reference and expands upon them by adding another 22 local rules of professional conduct.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnmilaw.org/pdf/court_rules/R07.pdf Northern Mariana Islands Rules of Attorney Discipline and Procedure.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== California ===

[[California]] still has its own set of unique rules governing professional attorney conduct.  Although many of the rules are similar and sometimes identical to the ABA Model Rules, the California rules differ markedly from the ABA models in both format, scope and content.  For example, under the ABA Model Rules, an attorney may be disciplined for the ''appearance'' of impropriety, regardless whether any actual impropriety occurred; whereas the California rules permit discipline for only ''actual'' impropriety.  This reflects the nature of California law.

It is unlikely that California will ever adopt the ABA Model Rules apart beyond harmonising the format and existing California rules that are identical or nearly identical to ABA Model Rules.  Reasons for this reluctance include the fact there are more than 280,000 attorneys licensed in California, so a drastic change from the existing rules to completely different rules would shock the profession and, ultimately, would most likely fail.  Additionally, many of California's rules of professional conduct are established by statute and, thus, would require action by the California Legislature to change them; or, alternatively, action by the people of California through the voter initiative process.

Another important factor is that the legal profession is regulated very differently in California than it is in the rest of the United States.  Outside of California, the profession is regulated solely by the judicial branch of state government.  Within California, the State Bar of California operates as a state government agency under the supervision of the California Supreme Court; but the State Bar was created by the California Legislature, and the Legislature has full power to regulate the legal profession, if it so wishes.  In particular, the State Bar cannot collect annual member dues unless and until the California Legislature passes an annual State Bar Dues Bill, which the governor must sign into law.  When Governor [[Pete Wilson]] vetoed the dues bill in 1997, the State Bar effectively shut down operations except for self-funded activities like the California Bar Exam.  In 2010, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] vetoed the dues bill but a crisis was averted on that occasion.

But the most important reason the California Bar is reluctant to adopt the ABA Model Rules is that most members believe the ABA Model Rules would not sufficiently protect the California public from harm.  This is due to California law and public policy being so markedly different from the rest of the country in so many ways.  For example, California is one of only four states where covenants not to compete are void as against public policy; and it is one of only three states where trusts are presumed to be revocable unless the trust instrument explicitly states the trust is irrevocable (whereas the opposite is true in the other 47 states).

By way of comparative example, [[California]] has long held the position that clients must be encouraged to speak candidly to their legal counsel about both past and future actions knowing their statements will be held in complete confidence. Their counsel can then explain the relevant law to them and urge them to conform their future conduct to the law, thus promoting lawful conduct. In contrast, ABA Model Rule 1.6 contains exceptions to [[confidentiality]] for both violent and nonviolent (e.g. financial) future crimes, which California believes creates a strong disincentive for clients to discuss their future plans with their attorneys - but for which the client might chose to comply with the law instead of violating it.

Another notable difference is that ABA Model Rule 1.8(j) contains an outright ban on [[sexual intercourse|sexual relations]] between attorney and client (unless the relationship predated the legal representation), while California Rule 3-120 only prohibits sexual relationships, that Require or demand sexual relations with a client incident to or as a condition of any professional representation; or, 2) Employ coercion, intimidation, or undue influence in entering into sexual relations with a client; or, 3) Continue representation of a client with whom the member has sexual relations if such sexual relations cause the member to perform legal services incompetently. The rule does not mention contracts for sexual services (i.e. prostitution) but as these contracts are criminally illegal in California, it is arguably not necessary to specify them.

A third major difference is that ABA Model Rule 4.1 prohibits an attorney from making a "false statement of material fact or law to a third person."  While the ABA model expressly applies to ''any'' context in which a lawyer acts in a representative capacity, California Rule 5-200 prohibits an attorney only from making false statements before a court. 
 
In 2001, the Commission for the Revision of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar of California began a comprehensive revision of the California rules that would, among other things, convert them into a localized version of the ABA Model Rules. However, the Commission's progress had been extremely slow, simply because there are so many substantive and structural differences between the California rules and the ABA models. In October 2010, the State Bar of California formally adopted the Commission's report, recommending adoption of 67 proposed changes to harmonise the California Rules of Professional Conduct with the ABA Model Rules of Professional Responsibility.

On September 19, 2014, however, for reasons that were not fully explained, the Supreme Court of California rejected all of the proposed revisions and returned them to the State Bar.&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rogers|first1=Joan C.|title=California Justices Tell State Bar to Redo Proposals for Updating Lawyer Conduct Rules|url=http://www.bna.com/california-justices-tell-n17179895795/|accessdate=15 October 2014|work=ABA/BNA Lawyers’ Manual on Professional Conduct|publisher=Bloomberg BNA|date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zitrin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zitrin|first1=Richard|title=Viewpoint: State Supreme Court Resets Ethics Rewrite|url=http://www.therecorder.com/home/id=1202673053087/State-Supreme-Court-Resets-Ethics-Rewrite|accessdate=15 October 2014|work=The Recorder|publisher=ALM Media Properties, LLC|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court's letter directed the State Bar to start the process all over again with a new Commission, and to submit a new set of revised rules by March 31, 2017.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zitrin" /&gt;

==Professional regulation==
Except for the [[USPTO registration examination|Patent Bar]], there is no national legal profession in the United States but there are 56 separate legal professions.  In contrast to most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]], where transactional lawyers and litigators are separately licensed as "solicitors" and "barristers," respectively; all American attorneys are licensed to practice as both solicitors and barristers (therefore these terms are almost never used).  Likewise, whereas solicitors in England and Wales are professionally self-regulated by the private-sector [[Law Society of England and Wales]] while barristers are self-regulated by the private-sector [[General Council of the Bar]], attorneys in all states except California, all territories and the District of Columbia are generally regulated by the ''public sector'' judicial branch of state, district or territorial government, as officers of the court. The legal profession in California is regulated jointly by the California Supreme Court, mostly through its agency the State Bar of California and by the California Legislature, which exercises legislative control over all professions.

Within the public sector regulatory agencies, boards and organisations, officers are invariably licensed members of the pertinent profession while key managerial and general staff typically are not.  The Executive Director and Deputy Executive Director of the State Bar of California, for example, are active members of the State Bar.  While either of their secretaries ''could'' be a member of the State Bar, they most likely are not.  Similarly, the Board of Trustees that oversee the business operations of the State Bar of California under supervision of the California Supreme Court is legally required to be a mix of attorneys licensed to practice in California and "public members" who may not be licensed attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calbar.ca.gov/AboutUs/BoardofTrustees.aspx Board of Trustees, State Bar of California.&lt;/ref&gt;

So, while American attorneys are regulated by public sector agencies instead of private sector law societies, most of the people who develop the regulatory policies are practising attorneys and sitting judges, so there ''is'' a degree of self-regulation but not nearly to the same degree that solicitors and barristers in England and Wales, and other Commonwealth jurisdictions are self-regulated by private sector associations.

'''Androcide''' refers to the systematic killing of [[men]], [[boy]]s, or males in general.
==Lexicology==
''Androcide'' is a coordinate term of [[femicide]] and a hyponym of ''[[gendercide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Welsh|first1=EE|title=Establishing Difference: The Gendering and Racialization of Power in Genocide|date=2012|url=http://etd.fcla.edu/CF/CFE0004297/Welsh_Thesis_Final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymological root of the [[hybrid word]] is derived from a combination of the Greek prefix ''andro'' meaning "man" or boy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danner|first1=Horace|title=A Thesaurus of Medical Word Roots|date=2013|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Latin suffix ''cide'', meaning killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Tamara|title=The Greek &amp; Latin Roots of English|date=2014|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People==
In the proactive scenario of human societies, androcide may be a deliberate goal, perhaps with the goal of degrading the offensive capabilities of an adversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Synnott|first1=Anthony|title=Re-Thinking Men: Heroes, Villains and Victims|date=2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RHx6BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT204&amp;dq=%22%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9781409491958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more passive scenario androcide has been likened to misandry when society in general participate or permit the decimation of a significant proportion of men and boys during conscriptions for military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nathanson|first1=Paul|title=Replacing Misandry: A Revolutionary History of Men|date=2015|ref=45|quote=without referring to the androcide of course that many societies have imposed at a later stage of the life cycle in the form of military conscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fruit flies an androcidal animosity towards males may be due to rivalry, a perception of a challenge to their dominance or a combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Srivastava|first1=U.S.|title=Golden jubilee commemoration volume, 1980|date=1980|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations that are critical of feminism as well as some publishers have argued that the targeting of men is a contemporary issue in war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nathanson|first1=Paul|title=Legalizing Misandry: From Public Shame to Systemic Discrimination Against Men|date=2006|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Androcide has also been a feature of literature in ancient Greek mythology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skempis|first1=Marios|title=Geography, Topography, Landscape: Configurations of Space in Greek and Roman Epic|date=2014|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in hypothetical situations wherein there is discord between the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Robin|title=Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist|date=1977|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants==

'''Anthony Sawoniuk''', formerly '''Andrei Andreeovich Sawoniuk''' ({{lang-be|Андрэй Саванюк}}; 7 March 1921 – 6 November 2005) was a [[Belarusian people|Belarusian]] [[Nazism|Nazi]] collaborator from the town of [[Damachava|Domaczewo]] in [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]]. 

After taking part in the murder of the Jewish community in his home town, Sawoniuk served in the [[SS]] until November 1944 when he defected to the [[Polish II Corps]] in the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]. After the war, he settled in Britain, became a British subject, and became the first and only person to be convicted under the UK's [[War Crimes Act 1991]], when he was found guilty of war crimes in 1999. He died in prison six years later, aged 84.

== Early life ==
Andrei Sawoniuk was born in Domaczewo, [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (now [[Damachava]], [[Belarus]]), a spa town on the [[Bug River]]. At that time 90% of the town's population were ethnic Jews, with the remainder being [[Poles]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Belorussians]] and German [[Volksdeutsche]]. Sawoniuk, nicknamed "Andrusha" (a Russian and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] diminutive of [[Andrey]]),&lt;ref name="nazis-hired-killer-who-lay-low-for-50-years"/&gt; has been described as Belorussian,&lt;ref name="new-arch.rp.pl"&gt;http://new-arch.rp.pl/artykul/219849_Najkrocej.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Efraim Zuroff, "Operation Last Chance: One Man's Quest to Bring Nazi Criminals to Justice", Macmillan, 2009, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; some newspaper reports say that his mother was Polish,&lt;ref name="nazis-hired-killer-who-lay-low-for-50-years"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/nazis-hired-killer-who-lay-low-for-50-years-1084566.html|title=Nazi's hired killer who lay low for 50 years|date=4 February 1999|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=8 October 2010 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Buncombe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sawoniuk never knew the identity of his father,&lt;ref name="LFNL"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/apr/02/2|title=Life for Nazi 'lord' who murdered Jews and then escaped to Britain|last=Hopkins|first=Nick|date=2 April 1999|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 October 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; although townspeople believed him to be Josef Jakubiak, the town's Jewish schoolmaster, because his mother Pelagia had been working as a cleaner at Jakubiak's school and home during the months when Sawoniuk was conceived. Sawoniuk's half-brother Nikolai said to the British ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper: "People in the village said that my brother was the son of the schoolmaster. I think the same."&lt;ref name="RETRIBUTION AT LAST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/RETRIBUTION+AT+LAST%3b+It+took+%5Bpounds+sterling%5D11m+and+56+years.+But...-a0109794040|title=RETRIBUTION AT LAST; It took &lt;nowiki&gt;[pounds sterling]&lt;/nowiki&gt;11m and 56 years.

The family were poor: his mother worked washing clothes while Sawoniuk and his half-brother collected firewood to sell.&lt;ref name="nazis-hired-killer-who-lay-low-for-50-years"/&gt; Sawonuik also worked as a [[sabbath goy]]: a gentile employed by Orthodox Jews to carry out Sabbath tasks that were forbidden to them, such as lighting fires or chopping wood. He learnt basic Yiddish from his employers.&lt;ref name="into-the-evil-heart-of-history"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/into-the-evil-heart-of-history-1070832.html|title=Into the evil heart of history|last=Lebor|first=Adam|date=14 February 1999|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=16 October 2016 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Actions during and after World War II ==
During [[World War II]] Sawonuik was a member of the local Nazi-supported [[Belarusian Auxiliary Police]]&lt;ref name="nazis-hired-killer-who-lay-low-for-50-years"/&gt;&lt;ref name="W Wielkiej Brytanii zmarł zbrodniarz wojenny z Białorusi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80649,3004388.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416081010/http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80649,3004388.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 April 2013|title=W Wielkiej Brytanii zmarł zbrodniarz wojenny z Białorusi|date=7 November 2005|work=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]|language=Polish|accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rose to the rank of Commandant.&lt;ref name="into-the-evil-heart-of-history"/&gt; While serving in the police he participated in the [[Holocaust|murdering of Jews]].

In 1944 Sawoniuk fled westwards when the [[Red Army]] advanced towards Domaczewo and in July 1944 joined the German armed forces, serving in the [[30th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Russian)|30th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS]].&lt;ref name="LFNL"/&gt; He deserted from the SS in November 1944 and changed sides, using his Polish birth certificate&lt;ref name="LFNL"/&gt; to join the 10th Hussar Regiment of the [[Polish II Corps]].&lt;ref name="sawoniuk-betrayed-by-letter-intercepted-by-the-kgb"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sawoniuk-betrayed-by-letter-intercepted-by-the-kgb-1084567.html|title=Sawoniuk betrayed by letter intercepted by the KGB|work=[[The Independent]] | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Buncombe | date=2 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/309814.stm|title=War crimes trial could be first and last|work=[[BBC Online]] | date=1 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" R. v.

After the war Sawoniuk settled in England in 1946, posing as a Polish patriot.&lt;ref name="AP2005"&gt;{{cite news|author=AP|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/07/AR2005110701777_pf.html|title=Nazi War Criminal Dies in U.K. Prison|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=22 April 2015 | location=Washington | date=7 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 he wrote a letter to his half-brother, Nikolai. The [[KGB]], who already suspected him of being a war criminal, intercepted the letter and noted that he was now living in the UK. It was not until the 1980s that the KGB started sharing such information with the UK. However, even then, due to a misspelling of his name, it took until 1993 for authorities to realise that Sawoniuk, then working for [[British Rail]], was one of the people on the KGB list and was duly arrested.

== Trial ==
Sawoniuk had by that time become a British citizen.&lt;ref name="Sawoniuk guilty of war crime"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/309559.stm Sawoniuk guilty of war crime] [[BBC Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was tried at the [[Old Bailey]] in London in 1999 on two [[specimen charges]] of murder with regard to the murder of Jews in his [[Nazi occupied Poland|German]]-occupied hometown during [[World War II]]. The jury found him guilty of one charge by unanimous decision and of the other by a ten to one majority. A further two charges of murder were withdrawn by the prosecution due to procedural errors with evidence. However, both of the murders of which Sawoniuk was convicted were individual elements of two group murders: in the first Sawoniuk, according to eyewitnesses, shot 15 Jews; in the second he shot three Jews.&lt;ref name="Nazi war criminal dies in UK prison"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1081468.ece|title=Nazi war criminal dies in UK prison|last=Freeman|first=Simon|date=7 November 2005|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=8 October 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his trial Sawoniuk said of his accusers "They are professional liars. They have criminal records. Some of the witnesses at the magistrates court have done 25 years, alcoholics. I was the best friend of the Jews." He also stated that "Everyone is telling lies. They have been told by the Russian KGB to say there was a ghetto. These devils came here with their lies against me." and "I have done no crime whatsoever. My conscience is clear. I killed no one. I would not dream of doing it. I am not a monster I am an ordinary working-class poor man."&lt;ref name="I am not a monster, claims war crimes defendant"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/23/2|title=I am not a monster, claims war crimes defendant|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 October 2010 | location=London | date=23 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also denied having been a member of the German armed forces, stating "I have never been in the German army". In court, he accused a member of the [[Metropolitan Police]] of fabricating a [[Waffen-SS]] document which contained his details.  He speculated that the Metropolitan Police had conspired against him with the help of the KGB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/302032.stm|title=Sawoniuk threatens to storm out|date=23 March 1999|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was given two life sentences and trial judge Mr Justice Potts recommended that Sawoniuk should spend the rest of his life in prison.&lt;ref name="Scuffle of the week"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/scuffle-of-the-week/96667.article|title=Scuffle of the week|date=28 June 1999|work=The Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first and the only person in United Kingdom to be convicted under the [[War Crimes Act 1991]]. From a legal perspective this case is interesting as it was also the first time that a British jury had travelled overseas to view the scene of a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/309559.stm|title=Sawoniuk guilty of war crime|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=8 October 2010 | date=1 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the House of Lords refused him permission to appeal.&lt;ref name="lords-throw-out-nazis-legal-plea"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/lords-throw-out-nazis-legal-plea-706672.html |title=Lords throw out Nazi's legal plea |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=19 June 2000 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sawoniuk died in [[Norwich Prison]] of natural causes aged 84.&lt;ref name="AP2005"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15106">The '''California Public Records Act''' (Statutes of 1968, Chapter 1473; currently codified as [[California Government Code]] §§ 6250 through 6276.48&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=06001-07000&amp;file=6250-6270.5 §§ 6250]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a law passed by the [[California]] [[California State Legislature|State Legislature]] and signed by the [[Governor of California|governor]] in 1968 requiring inspection or disclosure of governmental records to the public upon request, unless exempted by law.

The law is similar to the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], except that "the people have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business" is enshrined in Article 1 of the [[California Constitution]] due to [[California Proposition 59 (2004)|California Proposition 59]] (the Sunshine Amendment, 2004).

==Purpose==
When the legislature enacted CPRA, it expressly declared that "access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state."&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't Code § 6250.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in California "access to government records has been deemed a fundamental interest of citizenship"&lt;ref&gt;CBS v. Block, 42 Cal. 3d 646, 652 n.5, 230 Cal. Rptr. 362, 725 P. 2d 370 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; and has emphasized that "maximum disclosure of the conduct of governmental operations [is] to be promoted by the act."&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 651-52 (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt; By promoting prompt public access to government records, the CPRA is "intended to safeguard the accountability of government to the public."&lt;ref&gt;[[Register Div. of Freedom Newspapers Inc. v. County of Orange]], 158 Cal. App. 3d 893, 901, 205 Cal. Rptr. 92 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; As the California Supreme Court recognized in CBS v. Block:

{{quote|Implicit in a democratic process is the notion that government should be accountable for its actions. In order to verify accountability, individuals must have access to government files. Such access permits checks against the arbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 651.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Public records and exemptions==
In accordance with this policy, public records are broadly defined to include "any writing containing information relating to the conduct of a public's business prepared, owned, used or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristic[.]"&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't. Code § 6252(e).&lt;/ref&gt; Citing with approval an even broader definition of public records adopted by the California Attorney General, another court has stated:
{{quote|This definition is intended to cover every conceivable kind of record that is involved in the governmental process and will pertain to any new form of record-keeping instrument as it is developed. Only purely personal information unrelated to 'the conduct of the public's business' could be considered exempt from this definition, i.e., the shopping list phoned from home, the letter to a public officer from a friend which is totally void of reference to governmental activities.&lt;ref&gt;''San Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court'', 143 Cal. App. 3d 762, 774; 192 Cal. Rptr. 415, 422 (1983)(internal citations omitted); see also [[Versaci v. Superior Court]], 127 Cal. App. 4th 805, 813, 26 Cal. Rptr. 3d 92 (2005)(quoting Coronado Police Officers Ass'n v. Carroll, 106 Cal. App. 4th 1001, 1006, 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 553 (2003)(citing with approval same definition)).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Moreover, unless the public records of a local agency are exempt from the provisions of the CPRA, they must be made available for public inspection.&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v. Superior Court'', 5 Cal. 4th 337, 346, 19 Cal. Rptr. 2d 882, 852 P. 2d 377 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Exemptions must be narrowly construed and the public agency bears the burden of proving that an exemption applies.&lt;ref&gt;''Bakersfield City School Dist. v. Superior Court'', 118 Cal. App. 4th 1041, 1045, 13 Cal. Rptr. 3d 517 (2004); ''CSU Fresno Association v. Superior Court'', 90 Cal.App. 4th 810, 831, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 870 (2001); see also ''Lorig v. Medical Bd.'', 78 Cal. App. 4th 462, 467, 92 Cal. Rptr. 2d 862 (2000); ''County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court'', 82 Cal. App. 4th 819, 825, 98 Cal. Rptr. 2d 564 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the exemptions under the CPRA are set forth under Section 6254 and are specific as to certain records or types of records, but under Section 6255 a general exemption exists where, on the facts of the particular case, "the public interest served by not making the record public clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record".&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't Code § 6255 (commonly called the "catch all" exemption).&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing the propriety of an agency decision to withhold records, a court is charged with ascertaining whether nondisclosure was justified under either of these statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't Code § 6259(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the CPRA was modeled after the [[federal Freedom of Information Act]] ("FOIA"), 5 U.S.C. Section 552 et seq, courts may look to case law under FOIA in construing the CPRA.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court]]'', 53 Cal. 3d 1325, 1338, 283 Cal. Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d 240 (1991); [[ACLU v. Deukmejian]], 32 Cal. 3d 440, 447, 186 Cal. Rptr. 235, 651 P.2d 822 (1982); but see Williams, 5 Cal. 4th at 348-54 (holding that CPRA's exemption for law enforcement investigatory records did not incorporate FOIA criteria and thus courts cannot look to FOIA cases to interpret Section 6254(f) of the CPRA, but must look to the statutory language of the CPRA provision to construe the statute).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] held that when a public official or employee uses a ''personal'' account and/or device to communicate about the conduct of public business, such as e-mails or text messages, the applicable writings may be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act.&lt;ref&gt;''City of San Jose v. Superior Court'', 2 Cal. 5th 608 (March 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orders and appeals==
To facilitate prompt public access to public records, court orders either directing disclosure of public records or supporting an agency's decision of nondisclosure are immediately reviewable by an appellate court by way of an emergency petition seeking issuance of an extraordinary writ.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Gov't Code § 6259(c).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the California Supreme Court made clear that under this writ procedure, trial court orders are reviewable on their merits.&lt;ref&gt;Times Mirror Co., 53 Cal. 3d at 1336; see also [[State Bd. of Equalization v. Superior Court]], 10 Cal. App. 4th 1177, 1185, 13 Cal. Rptr. 2d 342 (1992) (echoing the decision in Times Mirror and stating that the scope of review by a writ of review is equivalent with the scope of review on appeal).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when a trial court order under the CPRA is reviewed by an appellate court, the independent review standard is employed for legal issues and factual findings made by the trial court will be upheld if they are based on substantial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Times Mirror Co., 53 Cal. 3d at 1336 (citing Block, 42 Cal. 3d at 650-51).&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 changes to Act==

In 2013, as part of budget negotiations, the Legislature approved a plan to make certain provisions in the Act optional for local agencies. The move was done in order to save "tens of millions of dollars" in state reimbursements to local agencies that comply with the Act,  according to Legislative Analyst's Office projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Budget bill would make it optional for California local governments to comply with public records laws | url= http://www.sacbee.com/2013/06/19/5507394/budget-bill-would-make-it-optional.html | newspaper= [[Sacramento Bee]] | date= 2013-06-19 | accessdate= 2013-06-19 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130619191957/http://www.sacbee.com/2013/06/19/5507394/budget-bill-would-make-it-optional.html# | archive-date= 2013-06-19 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes were added to the 2013 budget as rider bills [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB76 AB 76]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= SB 71 | url= http://openstates.org/ca/bills/20132014/AB76/ | newspaper= [[OpenStates]] | accessdate= 2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB71 SB 71], the former of which was vetoed by [[Jerry Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= SB 71 | url= http://openstates.org/ca/bills/20132014/SB71/ | newspaper= [[OpenStates]] | accessdate= 2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the bills, local agencies would no longer be required to provide the following, but are encouraged to follow them as "best practices":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Budget could limit public's access to government documents | url= http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-budget-open-records-20130619,0,659990.story |newspaper= [[L.A.

* Respond to a public record request within 10 days
* Provide electronic records in its native format
* Provide a reason for denying a request

Open government advocates and several California newspapers came out strongly against the measure. Jim Ewert, general counsel of the California Newspaper Publisher's Association, called the move "the worst assault on the public's right to know I have seen in my 18 years of doing this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= California Legislature Guts State Records Law | url= http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/06/18/58616.htm |newspaper= [[Courthouse News Service]] |date= 2013-06-18 | accessdate= 2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several newspapers, including the [[Oakland Tribune]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Oakland Tribune editorial: State lawmakers must restore California Public Records Act | url= http://www.insidebayarea.com/breaking-news/ci_23486160/oakland-tribune-editorial-state-lawmakers-must-restore-california |newspaper= [[Courthouse News Service]] |date= 2013-06-18 | accessdate= 2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fresno Bee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= EDITORIAL: Tell Jerry Brown to veto attack on Public Records Act | url= http://www.fresnobee.com/2013/06/18/3349183/editorial-tell-brown-to-veto-attack.html |newspaper= [[Fresno Bee]] |date= 2013-06-18 | accessdate= 2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Visalia Times-Delta,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Editorial: RIP, California Public Records Act | url= http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/article/20130619/OPINION01/306190004/Editorial-RIP-California-Public-Records-Act |newspaper= [[Visalia Times-Delta]] |date= 2013-06-19 | accessdate= 2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; published editorials against the changes.

Because of the outcry from the media, state leaders backed down within the week and reversed the changes. The Assembly passed a measure to revoke that provision in the budget bill, which Jerry Brown signed into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/jun/20/california-assembly-repeals-changes-public-records/|title=California Assembly Repeals Changes To Public Records Act|last=Orr|first=Katie|date=June 20, 2013|work=KPBS Radio News|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013 the legislature approved a constitutional amendment proposal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SCA3 SCA 3] from the California Legislature website&lt;/ref&gt; authored by state senator [[Mark Leno]], which would incorporate the Public Records Act into the [[California State Constitution]]. The amendment clarifies that local governments must comply with requests for publicly available documents, and requires local governments to pay the costs of those requests in full. The proposed amendment went to the voters for approval in June 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2013/09/public-records-act-amendment-going-to-june-ballot.html|title=California Public Records Act amendment going to June ballot|last=White|first=Jeremy B.|date=September 10, 2013|work=Sacramento Bee|accessdate=13 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911231824/http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2013/09/public-records-act-amendment-going-to-june-ballot.html#|archive-date=2013-09-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was passed with 61.8% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowen|first1=Debra|authorlink1=Debra Bowen|title=Statement of Vote, June 3, 2014 Statewide Direct Primary Election|url=http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2014-primary/pdf/2014-complete-sov.pdf|publisher=California Secretary of State|accessdate=11 February 2015|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Israel}}
The '''Israeli Central Elections Committee''' ({{lang-he|ועדת הבחירות המרכזית}}, ''Va'adet HaBehirot HaMerkazit'') is the body charged under the [[Knesset Elections Law]] of 1969 to carry out the elections for the upcoming [[Knesset]].  The committee is composed of Knesset members (and delegates) representing various parliamentary groups and is chaired by a [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court Justice]] (currently [[Salim Joubran]]).  Tasks for the committee include the authorization of party lists running for the Knesset, election financing, and publication and appeals of election results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections16/eng/about/cec_eng.htm The Central Elections Committee] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1985 Amendments===
In 1985, the Knesset approved a law which, for the first time, allowed the committee to disqualify a [[party list]] on the grounds of its ideological platform.  The law allowed the committee to bar parties from elections that negate the existence of Israel as a [[Jewish and democratic state]], made incitements to [[racism]], or supported the armed struggle of an enemy state or terrorist organization against the state of Israel.&lt;ref name="HA"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=162890&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=0&amp;sbSubContrassID=0 Entry barriers to the Knesset race] Haaretz, 13 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The first provision, dealing with the existence of Israel as a Jewish state, has been the most controversial since it is possible that parties favoring a [[one-state solution]] could be banned under it.

===1988 Party Bans===
The committee decided to ban the [[Progressive List for Peace]] (PLP) and the [[Kach Party]] in 1988.  The former was banned for allegedly negating the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state; the later party was banned because of incitements to racism.  The [[Supreme Court of Israel]] sustained the ban against Kach, but overturned the ban on the PLP reasoning that it was impossible to determine that "the real, central and active purpose [of the list] is to bring about the elimination of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish people".&lt;ref name="HA" /&gt;

===2003 Party Ban Controversy===
In 2003, [[Likud]] MK [[Michael Eitan]] initiated a move to ban the [[Ta'al|Ta'al Party]] from participating in that year's Knesset elections.  MK [[Michael Kleiner]], the leader of the right-wing [[Herut]] Party, initiated a similar move against the [[Balad (Israel)|Balad Party]], arguing that Balad was "a cover-up for illegal activity" and that it "supports terror organizations, identifies with the enemy and acts against Israel as a Jewish and democratic state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=230464&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=0&amp;sbSubContrassID=0 Right-wing MKs launch bid to disqualify Arab parties] Haaretz, 14 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central Election Committee proceeded to vote by a one-vote majority to disqualify Balad and Ta'al lists from the elections.  Supreme Court Justice [[Michael Cheshin]], who chaired the committee, voted against the ban, stating that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the claims against the parties and individuals within those parties, but also said that Balad's leader Azmi Bishara's past expressions of support of the militant pro-Iranian Hezbollah in Lebanon had angered him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=247451&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=0&amp;sbSubContrassID=0 Election Committee disqualifies MK Bishara and Balad list] Haaretz, 1 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The bans were appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court, where the Court unanimously overturned the bans on the [[Ta'al]] list and party leader [[Ahmad Tibi]].  The Court also overturned the ban on [[Balad (political party)|Balad]] and party leader [[Azmi Bishara]] by a 7-4 majority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2641227.stm Poll ban on Arab Israelis lifted] BBC News, 9 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 Party Bans ===
On 12 January 2009 the Committee voted to ban two Arab political parties, [[Balad (political party)|Balad]] and the [[United Arab List]]—Ta'al, from participating in the February elections. The vote passed 26-3 with one abstention to ban Balad from the elections and 21-3 with eight abstentions to disqualify UAL—Ta'al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7825032.stm |title= Israel disqualifies Arab parties |publisher= BBC |date= 2009-01-12 |accessdate= 2009-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure was proposed by the [[National Union (Israel)|National Union]] and [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] parties, who accused Balad and UAL—Ta'al of supporting terrorism and failing to recognise Israel as a democratic Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/01/2009112165350696500.html&lt;/ref&gt; Yisrael Beitenu chairman [[Avigdor Lieberman]], stated that "The next step is to declare Balad illegal because it's a terror organisation that seeks to hurt Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1231760644913&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title= Elections C'tee bans UAL, Balad lists |first= Shelly |last= Paz |publisher= Jerusalem post |date= 2009-01-12 |accessdate= 2009-02-16 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaders of the Arab parties denied the charges and appealed the decision to the Supreme court. Tibi described the vote as "a political trial led by a group of fascists and racists who are willing to see the Knesset without Arabs and want to see the country without Arabs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/01/2009112165350696500.html |title=  Israel poll ban for Arab parties |publisher= Al Jazeera |date= 2009-01-13 |accessdate= 2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamal Zahalka]], chairman of Balad, warned that the decision would lead to a deeper crisis between Israel's Jewish and Arab citizens.

On 21 January 2009, the Supreme Court overturned the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1057497.html |title=Supreme Court revokes ban on Arab parties from national elections |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2009-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227174006/http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1057497.html# |archive-date=27 February 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[law]], a '''chambers''' is a room or office used by barristers or a judge. A '''barrister's chambers''' or '''barristers' chambers''' are the rooms used by a barrister or a group of barristers. A '''judge's chambers''', on the other hand, is the office of a [[judge]], where the judge may hear certain types of cases, instead of in open court.

== Judge's chambers ==

A judge's chambers is the office of a judge, where certain types of matters can be heard "in chambers", also known as ''[[in camera]]'', rather than [[in open court]]. Generally, cases heard in chambers are cases, or parts of cases, in which the public and press are not allowed to observe the procedure.&lt;ref name= Amo&gt;{{Citation | first = Eugene | last = Ehrlich | title = Amo, Amas, Amat and More | page = 151 | ISBN = 0-06-272017-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge's chambers are often located on upper floors of the [[court house]], away from the [[courtroom]]s, sometimes in groupings of judge's chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Designing Commercial Interiors|pages=338|last=Piotrowski|first=C M|last2=Rogers|first2=E A|location=New Jersey, USA|year=2013|isbn=9781118656976|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In some jurisdictions, a courtroom, rather than the judge's actual chambers, are used to hear matters "in chambers". Such courtrooms may also be called "chambers".

== Barristers' chambers ==

In [[England and Wales]], [[New Zealand]], Australia, India, Pakistan and Hong Kong, chambers may refer to the office premises used by a [[barrister]] or to a group of barristers, especially in the [[Inns of Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.venables.co.uk/bar.htm | title=Barristers' Chambers in England and Wales | publisher=Legal Resources in UK and Ireland| accessdate=4 October 2011 | author=Venables, Delia}}&lt;/ref&gt; To share costs and expenses, barristers typically operate fraternally with each other, as [[unincorporated association]]s known as "chambers". The term "Chambers" is used to refer both to the physical premises where the Barrister's Set conduct most of their work from., as well as the 'set' or unincorporated association itself. Most prosperous Chambers typically have office spaces for the barristers to work from, conference rooms with infrastructure to conduct video conferencing for a large audience, printing and photocopying sections, a substantially large and updated [[Library]], as well as rooms for the Barristers' and clients' dining and entertainment. Most Chambers have a staff to look after administrative matters, including a full-fledged kitchen and dining hall to serve up meals and refreshments. The transactional side of chambers are administered by [[barristers' clerk]]s who receive cases from [[Solicitor]]s and agree on matters such as fees on behalf of their employers; they then provide case details to the barristers and conduct office management for them.&lt;ref name="Griffiths-Baker"&gt;{{cite book|title=Serving Two Masters: Conflicts of Interest in the Modern Law Firm|last=Griffiths-Baker|first=Janine|pages=51–52|chapter=The Modern Fiduciary: Conflicts in Other Professions|publisher= Hart Publishing|isbn=9781841132297|year=2002|location=Oregon, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some chambers specialise in particular areas of law. Members are known as tenants, and can only be dismissed for gross misconduct. 

There are chambers all over England and Wales; however, the largest concentration of them is in [[London]].&lt;ref name="Griffiths-Baker"/&gt; A report by the [[General Council of the Bar]] in 2006, showed that of the 355 practising chambers in the [[United Kingdom]], 210 were based in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Criminal Justice in England and the United States|pages=166|last=Herschel|first=David|last2=Wakefield|first2=William|last3=Sasse|first3=Scott|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|location=MA, USA|year=2007|isbn=9780763741129}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Hong Kong, the 133 chambers within the [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region]] are almost exclusively located in the [[Victoria, Hong Kong|City of Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barlist.hkba.org/hkba/ChambersEN/Chambers.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122100845/http://barlist.hkba.org/hkba/ChambersEN/Chambers.htm |archivedate=22 January 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah''''', 508 U.S. 520 (1993), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that an ordinance passed in [[Hialeah, Florida]], forbidding the "unnecessar[y]" killing of "an animal in a public or private ritual or ceremony not for the primary purpose of food consumption", was [[unconstitutional]].

==Background==
[[Santería]] is an [[Afro-American religion]] developed as a [[syncretism]] of Roman [[Catholicism]] and [[Yoruba religion]] by [[Yoruba people]] brought as slaves from [[Yorubaland]] to [[Cuba]] by the [[Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=975414503455261754&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah''], 508 U.S. 520 at 524 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  Adherents believe they can fulfill their destiny through the aid of beings known as [[orisha]]s, who subsist off blood from [[animal sacrifice]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 524.&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals, usually chickens, killed during [[ritual slaughter]] are then cooked and eaten by the celebrants, except during death and healing rituals, where sick energy is believed to have passed into the sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 525.&lt;/ref&gt;  Santeria has been subject to widespread persecution in Cuba, so it is traditionally practiced in secret, employing [[saint symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 525.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye]], Inc., is a Florida nonprofit organized in 1973 by Ernesto Pichardo, who was an Italero-level priest in the Santeria faith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6451893913491955445&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah''], 723 F. Supp. 1467 (S.D. Fla. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Lucumí language]] is used in the Santeria liturgy and [[Babalú-Ayé]] is the spirit of wrath and disease.  In April 1987, the Church leased a property at 173 W. 5th Street, Hialeah, in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]] and announced its intention to use the site to openly practice the faith.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi, 723 F. Supp. at 1477.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hialeah City Council held an emergency public session on June 9, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 526.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the session, Councilman Silvio Cardoso stated that the religion is "in violation of everything this country stands for"; Councilman Andres Mejides observed that the Bible does not allow this particular type of animal sacrifice; and Councilman Julio Martinez noted (to audience applause) that in Cuba "people were put in jail for practicing this religion."&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 541 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Hialeah's police chaplain testified that the Church worshiped "demons" and the city attorney testified that "This community will not tolerate religious practices abhorrent to its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 542 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Pichardo’s brief testimony was met with taunts from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 541 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the session the city council passed a resolution announcing its commitment to prohibit "all religious groups which are inconsistent with public morals, peace or safety”.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 526.&lt;/ref&gt;  The city further passed a resolution incorporating Florida’s animal cruelty statute into the city code and the city attorney obtained a [[Florida Attorney General]]'s Opinion from [[Bob Butterworth]] concluding that the state statute did not permit ritual animal sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 527, citing [http://www.myfloridalegal.com/ago.nsf/Opinions/2CF2A00641F0F180852565720056A3AA Fla. Op. Atty. Gen. 87-56], Annual Report of the Atty. Gen. 146, 147, 149 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 1987, the city council unanimously passed three new ordinances that criminalized “sacrifices of animals for any type of ritual, regardless of whether or not the flesh or blood of the animal is to be consumed.”&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 527.&lt;/ref&gt;  The city council exempted [[shechita|Kosher slaughterhouses]], regular slaughterhouses, hunting, fishing, pest extermination, euthanasia of stray animals, and feeding live rabbits to [[greyhound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 537.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church sued in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]].  On June 10, 1988, U.S. District Judge [[Eugene P. Spellman]] granted [[absolute immunity]] to the individual city council members and the mayor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3057933022209675661&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah''], 688 F. Supp. 1522 (S.D. Fla. 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 5, 1989, after a nine-day [[bench trial]], Judge Spellman granted [[summary judgment]] to the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 723 F. Supp. 1467.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] affirmed in an unsigned one-paragraph [[per curiam decision]], where it noted that Judge Spellman "employed an arguably stricter standard" than that applied in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'' (1990), which had in the interim found Native Americans could be fired for their ritual use of [[peyote]].&lt;ref&gt;936 F. 2d 586 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Smith'', Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] had even cited Judge Spellman’s opinion as authority, which the city highlighted in their appeals brief.&lt;ref name=uchicago&gt;{{cite journal|last1=[[Michael W. McConnell]]|title=Free Exercise Revisionism and the Smith Decision|journal=[[University of Chicago Law Review]]|date=September 1990|volume=57|issue=4|page=1109|url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4679&amp;context=uclrev|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court in ''[[Wisconsin v. Yoder]]'' (1972) had explicitly provided Amish parents a religious exemption from mandatory school attendance under the Free Exercise Clause.&lt;ref name=uchicago/&gt;  However, in the years since, free-exercise claimants had lost every case before the Court, with the exception of a line of employment decisions cases terminated by ''Smith''.&lt;ref name=uchicago/&gt;  The Church's petition for [[certiorari]] from the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] was granted, with [[Douglas Laycock]] appearing for the Church during [[oral argument]]s on November 4, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1992/91-948&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court==
===Opinion of the Court===
On June 11, 1993, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed.  Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], in an Opinion of the Court joined in parts by Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], and Justices [[Byron White]], [[John Paul Stevens]], [[Antonin Scalia]], [[David Souter]], and [[Clarence Thomas]] concluded that the city’s ordinances violated the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].

Kennedy read the ''Smith'' decision as requiring a compelling governmental interest if a law is not of neutral and general applicability.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 531.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy went on, in a section Souter and White refused to join, to conclude that although the ordinances were facially neutral, they were religiously “gerrymandered with care” to only apply to religious killings.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 542.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy, in a section only joined by Stevens, details the ordinances’ [[legislative history]], even citing taped excerpts of the Hialeah City Council Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 541 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, in a section Souter refused to join, Kennedy notes the numerous exemptions in the Florida statute, concluding the law is not generally applicable because it effectively applies “only against conduct motivated by religious belief.”&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 545.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, in a section joined by the full seven justice majority, Kennedy applies [[strict scrutiny]], which the city ordinances fail.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the ordinance suppressed more religious conduct than was necessary to achieve its stated ends, it was deemed unconstitutional, with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision, “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection”.&lt;ref&gt;"Criminal Law and Procedure By Daniel E. Hall - Cengage Learning, July 2008 - p. 266 [https://books.google.com/books?id=KnBnknQAHlkC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266&amp;dq=religious+beliefs+need+not+be+acceptable,+logical,+consistent+or+comprehensible+to+others+in+order+to+merit+First+Amendment+protection&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3ePeXVLZHE&amp;sig=v8SQRTZB0z8n5YNCA_kf98FlyPI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UeS-T76tC4TQgAfd1czyCQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=religious%20beliefs%20need%20not%20be%20acceptable%2C%20logical%2C%20consistent%20or%20comprehensible%20to%20others%20in%20order%20to%20merit%20First%20Amendment%20protection&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scalia's concurrence in part===
Justice Scalia joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, defended the ''Smith'' decision and attacked the use of [[legislative intent]], opining that there would be no constitutional violation if “the Hialeah City Council set out resolutely to suppress the practices of Santeria, but ineptly adopted ordinances that failed to do so”.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 558 (Scalia, J., concurring in part).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Souter's concurrence in part===
Justice Souter, writing alone for eighteen pages, noted that “The ''Smith'' rule, in my view, may be reexamined consistently with principles of ''[[stare decisis]]''.”&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 571 (Souter, J., concurring in part).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackmun's concurrence in the judgment===
Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], joined by Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], concurred in the judgment only.  Refusing to endorse the approach used in the majority opinion, Blackmun wrote, “I continue to believe that ''Smith'' was wrongly decided”.  Blackmun goes on, citing an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], to observe that had this case presented “a law that sincerely pursued the goal of protecting animals from cruel treatment”, the result may have been different.&lt;ref&gt;''Lukumi'', 508 U.S. at 580 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
Somewhat similarly in 2009, a [[freedom of religion]] case related to [[animal sacrifice]] was taken to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] in the case of ''Merced v. Kasson.''&lt;ref name="Merced"&gt;[http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/08/08-10358-CV0.wpd.pdf Merced v. Kasson], 577 F.3d 578 (5th Cir. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Merced was a Santeria priest and the president of Templo Yoruba Omo Orisha Texas, Inc., a Santeria religious group. He challenged [[Euless, Texas]] city ordinances prohibiting the slaughter of four-legged animals. The court ruled that the ordinances "substantially burden plaintiff's free exercise of religion without advancing a compelling governmental interest using the least restrictive means" and that Merced was entitled under the [[Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (TRFRA) to an injunction preventing the city from enforcing its ordinances that burdened his religious practices relating to the use of animals. The court did not reach Merced's claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.&lt;ref name="Merced"/&gt;

'''Citizenship of Russia''' is regulated by the [[Russian law|federal act]] regarding citizenship of the Russian Federation (of 2002, with the amendments of 2003, 2004, 2006), [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution of the Russian Federation]] (of 1993), and the [[International treaty|international treaties]] that cover citizenship questions to which the Russian Federation is a party. In accordance with the supremacy clause of the Constitution, international treaties of the Russian Federation have precedence over [[Law of Russia|Russian domestic law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=02.05.2012 |url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/02-05-2012/120996-russian_children-0/ |title=Russian children born abroad to be protected from foreign care |publisher=English pravda.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Terminology==
In the [[Russian language]], there is a distinction{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} between citizens of Russia, referred to as ''Rossiyane'' (plural, {{lang-ru|россияне}}; masc. singular россиянин ''Rossiyanin'' and fem. singular россиянка ''Rossiyanka''), and [[Russians|ethnic Russians]], referred to as ''Russkie'' ({{lang|ru|русские}}). The word ''Rossiyane'' is used much more often than ''Russkie'' in media and official documents. Those who have received Russian citizenship via naturalisation are also called Rossiyane, regardless of ethnicity and mother tongue (for example, [[Gérard Depardieu]] or [[Viktor Ahn]]). The word ''Rossiyane'' was coined by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] in the 18th century{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}.

==History==

The [[Tsardom of Russia]] became a [[multinational state]] in the 16th century. The word ''Rossiyane'', coined by Lomonosov, has been widely used since then. After the [[October Revolution|fall of the Russian Empire]], the expression "[[Soviet people]]" was used for the [[Demographics of the Soviet Union|population of the Soviet Union]], regardless of ethnicity. After the [[dissolution of the USSR]], the word ''Rossiyane'' became widely used again. 

===Post-Soviet Union===
Until 1990, the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) was a subject of the Soviet federation. In 1990, state sovereignty of the RSFSR was declared, though the [[USSR]] was not abolished until the end of 1991. Article 11 of the declaration of state sovereignty introduced RSFSR citizenship. The text of the citizenship act was ready in the summer of 1991, but was not adopted by the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Council]] (the [[legislative body]] of the RSFSR) until November 28, 1991. On January 23, 1992 some changes with respect to the [[dissolution of the USSR]] were applied to the text; the result was signed by the President and finally came into force after publication on February 6, 1992.

===Citizenship act of 1991===
In accordance with Article 13, former Soviet citizens among permanent residents on February 6, 1992 of the RSFSR were recognized as RSFSR citizens. Those who expressed their will not to become RSFSR citizens until February 6, 1993 were not recognized as RSFSR citizens. Supreme Council decree N 5206/1-1 recognized the following as Russian citizens:

* those who left the RSFSR before February 6, 1992 for study, work, treatment, or personal reasons and returned after February 6, 1992
* military personnel of RSFSR abroad

Former Soviet citizens who were born on December 30, 1922 or later on Russian territory or to a Soviet citizen who was a permanent resident of the RSFSR at the birth of his or her were recognized as if they had been RSFSR citizens by birth (see [[#Case of Smirnov (1996)|Case of Smirnov]]).

[[Image:Russian ePassport.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Russian passport]]s are a visible feature of Russian citizenship]]

Russian citizenship could be acquired:

* by birth
* by registration
* by naturalization
* by restoration of citizenship
* by opt
* by following parents' citizenship

===Compatriots act of 1999===
In 1999, in spite of the veto of the President, the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]] adopted the Act on the state policy on compatriots abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.scipio.fatal.ru/soot.html|title=Act on the state policy on compatriots abroad|publisher=Scipio.fatal.ru|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 11 stated that all former Soviet citizens and their descendants should be recognized as Russian citizens unless they had declared their intentions to be citizens of foreign states. However, this article was revoked in 2002 and persons under this article are not generally recognized by executive or court authorities of Russia as citizens of the Russian Federation unless they received documents of Russian citizenship before the article's revocation. No official comments have been given as to how this article should be interpreted. Oleg Kutafin, the chairman of the Presidential Committee on citizenship, criticized this Act in his book ''Russian Citizenship'' ({{ISBN|5-7975-0624-6}}), but the legal consequences of this Act were not analyzed there.

==Citizenship act of 2002==
In 2002, a new citizenship act, supported by President [[Vladimir Putin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=08.09.2003 |url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/08-09-2003/3667-law-0/ |title=New Citizenship Law Humiliates Russians |publisher=English pravda.ru |date=2002-05-31 |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200206/04/eng20020604_97109.shtml |title=Russian President Signs New Citizenship Law |publisher=English.peopledaily.com.cn |date=2002-06-04 |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; replaced the act of 1991.

Russian citizenship could be acquired:
* by birth
* by naturalization
* by restoration of citizenship
* by following parents' citizenship

The rules of citizenship by birth generally follow the principle of [[jus sanguinis]], though a child can be recognized as a Russian citizen in several special cases:
* neither parent, both of whom are permanent residents of Russia, is a Russian citizen, but the child is born in Russia and does not acquire any other citizenship
* the child is found abandoned on Russian territory and the parents remain unknown for more than six months

Naturalization is usually granted if the applicant meets the following requirements:
* has been a resident of Russia for not less than five years
* promises lawful behaviour
* has a legal source of income
* speaks Russian

In certain cases, some or even all of the above requirements can be waived by an Executive Order of the Russian President,&lt;ref name="Exec-Order"&gt;{{cite news|title=Executive Order on granting Russian citizenship to Gerard Depardieu|url=http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/4833 |date=January 3, 2013 |work=Russian Presidential Executive Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; as happened on 3 January 2013, when Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an Executive Order granting Russian citizenship to French-born actor [[Gérard Depardieu]], citing authority granted under Article 89(a) of the Constitution of the Russian Federation.&lt;ref name="Exec-Order" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gerard Depardieu Launches 'Proud to Be Russian' Series of Watches|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gerard-depardieu-launches-proud-be-690633 |date=March 24, 2014 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restoration of citizenship is granted under the same rules as naturalization; the only exception is the residence term requirement (three years in this case). Although not in compliance with law, executive agencies (such as the federal migration service and Russian diplomatic and consular departments abroad) usually do not grant Russian citizenship to former Russian citizens if they do not satisfy citizenship restoration requirements, even if they satisfy requirements for facilitated naturalization{{fact|date=May 2016}}.

A special provision of law made it possible for former citizens of the USSR to apply for Russian citizenship before 2009. The only requirements were holding a temporary residence permit or a permanent residence permit, or being registered as a permanent resident of Russia as of July 1, 2002 and meeting the naturalization requirements of p.&amp;nbsp;2 and p.&amp;nbsp;4.

Citizenship of children (persons under 18 years of age) generally follows the citizenship of their parents. If one or both parents obtain Russian citizenship, their children become Russian citizens as well. If one or both parents lose Russian citizenship, their children lose it too. A child can acquire or relinquish Russian citizenship by the application of his parents, but at least one parent must be a Russian citizen in this case.

==Visa requirements==
{{Main|Visa requirements for Russian citizens}}

Visa requirements for Russian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other countries placed on citizens of [[Russia]]. In 2016, Russian citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 105 countries and territories, ranking the Russian passport 48th in the world according to the [[Visa Restrictions Index]].

==Constitutional Court cases==

===Case of Smirnov (1996)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Smirnov was born on RSFSR territory in 1950. In 1979, he married and moved his permanent residence to the [[Lithuanian SSR]]. He divorced in 1992 and returned to the RSFSR on December 8, 1992. He then applied for a notice of Russian citizenship in his passport, but this was rejected by executive officers. His claim was also rejected by common jurisdiction courts, including the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.

The position of the executive officers and the courts was that Smirnov, in accordance with Article 13 of the Citizenship Act, was a former citizen of the Russian Federation, but not a citizen of the Russian Federation since February 6, 1992. He did have the option to apply for Russian citizenship through registration.

However, the Constitutional Court ruled that Article 18 of the Citizenship Act was not in conformance with the Constitution, as the registration procedure of Article 18 could be applied to Russian citizens by birth; that is, those persons who:
* were born in the territory of the RSFSR
* were citizens of the USSR
* did not renounce Russian citizenship
* relocated to another Soviet republic
* were not citizens of another Soviet republic
* eventually returned to Russia

There is an opinion that this ruling determines that every former citizen of the USSR who was born in the territory of the RSFSR and never renounced Russian citizenship is a Russian citizen by birth, even if he also has foreign citizenship. This opinion is based on the Court's interpretation of Article 6 of the Constitution given in the text of the decision: "such persons... cannot lose Russian citizenship unless they explicitly expressed their will to give it up". A notable advocate of this position is Anatoly Mostovoy, who published the book ''Get Your Citizenship Back!'' ({{ISBN|5-93165-077-6}}).

====Criticism of the decision====
1) incorrect interpretation of Article 13 of the Citizenship Act of 1991

: The interpretation of Article 13 of the Act given by the Constitutional Court does not conform to Article 12 of the Act, which states that citizenship before this Act came in force is determined by previous legislation. It is also not clear what legal consequences might be implied by declaring millions of people as Russian citizens for tens of years before the Act came in force, and even before the sovereignty of the RSFSR was declared.

: A different interpretation of Article 13 could be that "citizenship by birth in the past" defines a term which is used by Article 18, p. "e" and art. 19, p.&amp;nbsp;3, pp. "e" (since amended in 1993).

2) incorrect interpretation of constitutional articles

: Nothing in the Act states that "citizenship by birth in the past" confers Russian citizenship on the moment that the Act came into force. The Constitutional Court stated that "due to Article 6 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, they remain Russian citizens until they relinquish it of their own will" (p.&amp;nbsp;3 of the reasoning). However, the Constitution came into force in December 1993, and it evidently has no retroactive effect. Deprivation of citizenship in the USSR was legal and happened from time to time. No provisions of law restricted constructions like "a citizen only on his/her moment of birth".

3) there were no constitutional issues in this case

: Following the logic of Constitutional Court, Articles 13 and 18 of the Act conflict. The Constitutional Court should have stated why it applied Article 13 in this case. In general, considering conflicting legal norms, a court should choose one of them (using principles of [[lex posterior]] or [[lex specialis]], or a conflict norm). If one of these is chosen, it is not necessary to decide if the other is constitutional or not. The Constitutional Court has no jurisdiction to declare a norm of law unconstitutional just because it does not conform to another norm of law.

===Case of Daminova (2005)===
{{expand section|date=May 2017}}

===Case of Fatullaeva (2007)===
Until 2001-2002, former Soviet citizens could register their permanent residence on the territory of Russia in the same way as Russian citizens.

The federal act regarding Russian citizenship (2002) was amended several times to allow former Soviet citizens who had had their permanent residence registered on July 1, 2002 to apply for Russian citizenship.

Fatullaeva had been living in Russia up to this date but had never registered permanent residence.

She challenged the requirement of permanent residence registration at the Constitutional Court. The Court rejected her claim for the following reasons:
* such a requirement does not violate her constitutional rights and freedoms
* the state is not obliged to grant citizenship, except as provided by its laws, and Fatullaeva still would be able to obtain Russian citizenship after every requirement of law is satisfied

The Act on the Legal Status of Foreigners in the USSR (1981) was in force until 2002. According to this act, permanent residents of the USSR were persons who received permanent residence permits. Other foreigners were those with temporary residences in the USSR. However, former Soviet citizens did not apply for residence permits; they registered their permanent residence in the same manner as Russian citizens, in accordance with the Decree of Government N 290 of March 12, 1997. Therefore, registration of permanent residence was equivalent to obtaining residence permits in Russia{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

==International treaties on citizenship==

===Eurasian Economic Community treaties===
The [[Russian Federation]] has a treaty with [[Kazakhstan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.scipio.fatal.ru/rfkaz.html
|title=Treaty on the Facilitation of Acquisition of Citizenship between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan|publisher=Scipio.fatal.ru|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a treaty with [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.scipio.fatal.ru/kgrf.html
|title=Treaty on the Facilitation of Acquisition of Citizenship between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kyrgyzstan|publisher=Scipio.fatal.ru|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a multilateral treaty among the [[Russian Federation]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and the [[Republic of Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.scipio.fatal.ru/sog1.html
|title=Multilateral treaty on citizenship|publisher=Scipio.fatal.ru|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens of the respective states that come to Russia for permanent residence have the right to obtain Russian citizenship if they:
* were citizens of the [[RSFSR]], or
* were born in the territory of the [[RSFSR]], or
* were living in the territory of the [[RSFSR]] before December 21, 1991, or
* have relatives who are citizens or permanent residents of the [[Russian Federation]]

Until the end of 2003, those treaties were ignored by Russian executive authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://wbase.duma.gov.ru/ntc/vdoc.asp?kl=12244
|title=Declaration of State Duma on citizenship issues|publisher=Wbase.duma.gov.ru|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential Decree N 1545&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.rg.ru/2004/01/13/grazdanstvo.html
|title=Presidential decree N 1545|publisher=Rg.ru|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided some means for implementation of the treaties. However, the decree requires that the applicant provide evidence that the state of his citizenship allows him to reside in Russia (such as a special stamp in a passport or an exit document). This does not conform to the treaties and makes obtaining citizenship significantly more difficult or even impossible in some cases. The Supreme Court of the [[Russian Federation]] stated in its decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.supcourt.ru/stor_text.php?id=7408252
|title=Supreme Court decision on art. 22.1 of Presidential Decree on citizenship|publisher=Supcourt.ru|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; that one must prove, in accordance with the treaties, that he came to Russia for permanent and not temporary residence. This can be proved in accordance with Russian law. In accordance with the ''Act on the Status of Foreign Citizens in the Russian Federation'', obtaining temporary or permanent residence permission in Russia does not require any permission from foreign states, so technically every person who lawfully resides in Russia is able to apply for a temporary residence permit and then for a permanent residence permit. Although the interpretation of the Federal Act given by the Supreme Court is incompatible with the Presidential Decree, the article was not declared void.

===Dual citizenship treaties===
The following international treaties contain rules related to dual citizenship:
* Treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tajikistan (1995)
* Treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Turkmenistan (1993), the current status of which is in dispute

The Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Security between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.scipio.fatal.ru/trarm.html
|title=Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Security between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Armenia|publisher=Scipio.fatal.ru|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed December 29, 1991, grants the right to acquire citizenship of both Russia and Armenia to the citizens of Russia and Armenia.

As the Russian Federation is the successor state to the Soviet Union, some Soviet treaties on dual citizenship are still in force. For this reason, the [[Convention on the Nationality of Married Women]] is in force.

===European Convention on Nationality===
The [[European Convention on Nationality]] has been signed but not [[ratification|ratified]] by the Russian Federation. It is binding to the extent of the provisions of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]]. Domestic citizenship legislation is usually considered to conform to the convention.

{{About|the political meeting|customs relating to a Constitution|Constitutional convention (political custom)}}

[[File:Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States.jpg|400px|thumb|''[[Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States]]'']]

A '''constitutional convention''' is a gathering for the purpose of writing a new [[constitution]] or revising an existing constitution.&lt;ref name="definitionfromblackslawdictionary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thelawdictionary.org/constitutional-convention/ | title=Definition of 'Constitutional Convention' from Black's Law Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Members of a constitutional convention (sometimes referred to as "delegates" to a constitutional convention) are often, though not necessarily or entirely, elected by popular vote. However, a wholly popularly-elected constitutional convention can also be referred to as a [[Constituent assembly]].

==Examples==
===National Conventions===
Examples of constitutional conventions to form or revise the constitution of a nation include:
*'''United States''' 
** [[Annapolis Convention (1786)]], which proposed what became the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Convention]] (1787).
** [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Convention]] (1787), where the [[United States Constitution]] was drafted before being ratified by all thirteen of the States in the original Union.
** As to future amendments, two procedures are set out in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] of the constitution, but only one has ever been used. The process begins with [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], which by two-thirds majority votes of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] may submit amendments to the states for ratification. Under the second, untried method, amendments may be proposed by a [[Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution|convention of the states &lt;Smith v Union Bank of Georgetown 30US.518  1831&gt;]], which Congress must convene,  if asked to do so by the legislatures of two-thirds of the states. Under either method, a proposed amendment becomes part of the Constitution if it is ratified by three-fourths of the states, through state legislatures or [[state ratifying conventions]], whichever Congress chooses. So far, in all but one instance Congress has specified ratification by state legislatures. The convention route was used to ratify the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jost|first=In K.|title=Amending process|url=http://cqpress.com/incontext/constitution/docs/amending_process.html|work=The Supreme Court A to Z|publisher=CQ Press|accessdate=August 19, 2005|location=Washington|format=CQ Electronic Library, CQ Encyclopedia of American Government|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''France''': [[National Convention|The National Convention of 1792]] (commonly referred to as ''The Convention'') convened during [[The French Revolution]] on September 20 with the purpose of writing a Republican Constitution following [[10 August (French Revolution)|the suspension of the French Monarchy]].  The monarchy was officially abolished on September 21 by The Convention.
*'''Canada'''
** [[Quebec Conference, 1864]]
** [[London Conference of 1866]].
*'''[[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Australia]]''' held four constitutional conventions, one each in 1891, 1897, 1973, and [[Australian Constitutional Convention 1998|1998]]
*'''Germany''': [[Parlamentarischer Rat]] (Parliamentary Council) (1948) – Drafted the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law of the Federal Republic]] for ratification by the ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]''.
*'''Northern Ireland''': [[Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention]] (1975–1976) – a failed attempt to find a solution to the status of [[Northern Ireland]].
*'''Scotland''': [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] (1989) – produced a plan for Scottish [[devolution]].
*'''European Union''': [[Convention on the Future of Europe|European Convention]] (2001) – Drafted the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|Constitution for Europe]] for approval by the [[European Council]] and ratification by the [[List of European Union member states|member state]]s.
*'''[[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Philippines]]'''
**1898 - drafted the 1898 [[Malolos Constitution]], the basic law of the [[First Philippine Republic]], the very first constitutional republic in Asia.  The drafted constitution was written by [[Felipe Calderón y Roca]] and Felipe Buencamino as an alternative to a pair of proposals to the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]] by [[Apolinario Mabini]] and [[Pedro Paterno]]. After a lengthy debate in the latter part of 1898, it was enacted on 21 January 1899.
**1935 – to draft a constitution to create the autonomous [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] under the U.S. [[Tydings–McDuffie Act]]. The constitution was also used in the 3rd Republic (1946) until the passage of the 1973 constitution. Members were elected through the [[Philippine Constitutional Convention election, 1934]]
**1971 – to draft a revised constitution to replace the old U.S. customed 1935 Philippine constitution. Members were elected through the [[Philippine Constitutional Convention election, 1970]]. The system of government changed from Presidentitial to Parliamentary to Presidentital-Parliamentary (in 1984 amendment). The constitution lasted until the downfall of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in 1986 and [[Corazon Aquino]] appointed members to draft the 1987 Constitution through a [[Constitutional Commission]].
*'''Ireland''': In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Government of the 31st Dáil|government elected in March 2011]] has committed to establishing a "constitutional convention" to recommend [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional amendments]] on six specified issues and others it may consider; the government has separately promised amendments on five other issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2011/03/22/00005.asp Dáil debates Vol.728 No.3 p.5] March 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smaller Administrative Units===
Constitutional conventions have also been used by constituent states of federations — such as the individual states of the United States — to create, replace, or revise their own constitutions.  Several [[U.S. state]]s have held multiple conventions over the years to change their particular [[State constitution (United States)|state's constitutions]].
*[[Missouri]] has held four,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070529040453/http://www.courts.mo.gov/page.asp?id=1085 Law Matters: A Celebration of Two Constitutions  by Missouri Chief Justice Michael A. Wolff - Your Missouri Courts - September 9, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1820, 1865, 1875 and 1945.
*[[Michigan]] has held four,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/historical/miconstitution1835.htm Michigan Constitution of 1835]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1835,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michigan#19th century|19th Century Michigan History]]&lt;/ref&gt; 1850, 1908 and 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(jkafas45q3pl4k45z4ehxiqc))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-Constitution 1963 Constitution of the State of Michigan]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Massachusetts]] has held six, in [[Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1778|1778]], [[Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1779-1780|1779–80]], 1820-21, [[Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1853|1853]], 1917–18, and most recently 2016.
*[[Virginia Conventions]] have included six unlimited meetings. Constitutions were promulgated by fiat in 1776, 1864 and 1901-02, and ratified by referendum in 1829-30, 1850, and 1868. Limited Conventions and Constitutional Commissions resulting in revisions were held in 1927, 1945, 1956 and 1968. Subsequently the state legislature proposes amendments that are ratified in popular referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Dinan, John. "The Virginia State Constitution: a reference guide", {{ISBN|0-313-33208-8}}, 2006, p. 8-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Copyright Act 1911''', also known as the '''Imperial Copyright Act of 1911''', is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (UK) which received [[Royal Assent]] on 16 December 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1911/dec/16/royal-assent Royal Assent]&lt;/ref&gt; The act established copyright law in the UK and the [[British Empire]]. The act amended existing [[Copyright law of the United Kingdom|UK copyright law]], as recommended by a [[Royal Commission]] in 1878&lt;ref name="act-ann"&gt;Macgillivray, E. J., ''The copyright act, 1911, annotated'', 1912&lt;/ref&gt; and repealed all previous copyright legislation that had been in force in the UK.&lt;ref name="Coyle"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Coyle| first = Michael| title = The History of Copyright| publisher = Lawdit| date = 23 April 2003| url = https://www.lawdit.co.uk/reading-room/the-history-of-copyright name=../articles/The%20History%20of%20Copyright.htm|accessdate = 6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act also implemented changes arising from the first revision of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in 1908.&lt;ref name="Coyle"/&gt;

The act came into force in the UK on 1 July 1912, in the [[Channel Islands]] (except [[Jersey]]) on 1 July 1912, in Jersey on 8 March 1913, and in the [[Isle of Man]] on 5 July 1912. The Copyright Act 1911 applied or extended to all parts of the [[British Empire]]. In [[India]] the act came into force on 30 October 1912, in [[Territory of Papua|Papua]] on 1 February 1931, and all other British possessions on 1 July 1912. It was subsequently enacted on various dates in the self-governing dominions and "territories under protection" of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Patridge| first = R. C.

== The Act ==
In the two centuries after the [[Statute of Anne]] of 1710, which afforded copyright protection to books, other works were afforded copyright protection either through case law, as in the case of music, or through [[Acts of Parliament]], as in the case of engravings, paintings, drawings and photographs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| pages =9| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22copyright+act+1911%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn=978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in legislation such as the [[Engraving Copyright Act 1734]] and the Fine Arts Copyright Act 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mooney Cotter| first = Anne-Marie| title = Intellectual Property Law| publisher = Routledge Cavendish| year = 2003| pages =4| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=967501rHmt0C&amp;dq=%22copyright+act+1911%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn=978-1-85941-805-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Copyright Act 1911 consolidated previous copyright statutes, and apart from minor exceptions, the Copyright Act 1911 repealed all previous copyright legislation and established a single statute covering all forms of copyright.

The 1911 Act implemented the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], which abolished the [[common law copyright]] in unpublished works and responded to technological developments by conferring copyright on a new type of works not mentioned in the Berne Convention, namely [[sound recordings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = MacQueen| first = Hector L.| last2 = Waelde  | first2 = Charlotte| last3 = Graeme T.| first3 = Laurie| title = Contemporary Intellectual Property: law and policy | publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2007| pages =38| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=05hYU0au5NgC&amp;dq=%22copyright+act+1911%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn=978-0-19-926339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1911 Act abolished the need for registration at the [[Stationers' Hall]] and provided that copyright is established upon the creation of a work. However, as the 1911 Act come into effect at different times in different countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], registration at Stationers' Hall continued to be required in some Commonwealth countries after 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Arnold-Baker| first = Charles| title = The companion to British history | publisher = Routledge| year = 2001| pages =360| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VNAMjuMw_5kC&amp;dq=%22copyright+act+1911%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn=978-0-415-18583-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also stated that copyright arose in the act of creation, not the act of publishing.&lt;ref name="Coyle"/&gt;

The scope of copyright was further widened and producers of [[sound recordings]] were granted the exclusive right to prevent others reproducing their recordings, or playing them in public. The act provided that the copyright in literary, dramatic and music works could be infringed by the making of a film or other mechanical performance incorporating the copyrighted works.&lt;ref name="Coyle"/&gt;

In Israel, the bulk of amendments were made by the [[Knesset]] not to the 1911 Act itself, but to the 1924 Ordinance applying it, resulting in a situation in which the two legal instruments were in conflict - for instance, while the Act set a copyright term of 50 years after the author's death, the Ordinance set a term of 70. Because the Knesset did not amend the Act to respond to further technological developments, the Courts had to apply the Act's definitions, which were centered on artistic works, or types of works not mentioned in it - for instance, phone books, newspapers, restaurant menus and even the codes of Computer Programs were legally deemed "books" for copyright purposes, regardless of their (usually nonexistent) artistic value. These "stretched-boundaries" definitions are maintained in the Copyright Act 5778-2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/il/il027en.pdf Copyright Act 5778-2007, Section 1]: "In this Act -..."Literary work" – including works expressed in writing, lectures, tables, compilations, and computer programs"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary of changes ==
British lawyer [[Evan James Macgillivray]] summarised the changes in the introduction of his annotated edition of the 1911 Act as follows:&lt;ref name="act-ann"/&gt;

{{Quotation|The principal changes which the Act will effect upon the existing law may be briefly summarised —

# Extension of the term of copyright to life and fifty years (Subject to certain exceptions).
# Provision that the last twenty-five years of the term of copyright shall be unassignable by the author during his lifetime.
# Provision that during the last twenty-five years any person may reproduce a work without consent on payment of a ten per cent royalty.
# Exclusive right of dramatising and translating secured to the author.
# Dramatic works entitled to protection include pieces in dumb show, ballets and cinematograph productions, and the copyright is infringed by the making or exhibiting of unauthorised cinematograph films.
# Subject to the right in certain circumstances of making records upon payment of a royalty, the composer of a musical composition gets the sole right of adapting his composition for use upon mechanical instruments.

== Imperial copyright act ==
[[File:Copyright Act 1911.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Cover page of the British Copyright Act 1911, also known as the Imperial Copyright Act of 1911. "Part I Imperial Copyright. Rights. 1.(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, copyright shall subsist throughout the parts of His Majesty’s dominions to which this Act extends for the term hereinafter mentioned in every original literary dramatic music and artists work, if..."]]
With the exception of provisions that were expressly restricted to the United Kingdom by the act, all provisions of the Copyright Act 1911 applied "throughout His Majesty's dominions" and self-governing dominions if enacted by the parliament of that dominion without modifications that were not necessary to adapt the act "to the circumstances of the dominion". The Copyright Act 1911 was adapted to circumstances and enacted by the then self-governing dominions of [[Australia]] ([[Copyright Act 1912]]), [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (Newfoundland Copyright Act 1912) and the [[Union of South Africa]] (Patents, Designs, Trade Marks and Copyright Act 1916).
The Copyright Act 1911 also provided that the UK Secretary of State could certify copyright laws passed in any self-governing dominion if the copyright legislation was “substantially identical” to those of the Copyright Act 1911. Though the Secretary of State could certify copyright law even if their provisions on copyright enforcement and the restriction on importation of works manufactured in “foreign countries” were not identical to that of the Copyright Act 1911. Such self-governing dominions were then treated as if the Copyright Act 1911 extended to the self-governing dominion. The Secretary of State certified the copyright laws of [[New Zealand]] (New Zealand Copyright Act 1913, certified April 1914) and Canada ([[Copyright Act of Canada]] 1923, certified 1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Patridge| first = R. C. Barrington| title = The History of the Legal Deposit of Books| publisher = Read Books| year = 2008| pages = 153| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=79XC3RmBN_sC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-4437-2545-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Copyright Act 1911 also provided that “His Majesty may, by Order in Council, extend this Act to any territories under his protection and to Cyprus” and the act would then apply to these countries as if they were dominions of the [[British Empire]]. In 1912 an [[Order in Council]] extended the Copyright Act 1911 to [[Cyprus]] and the following territories: [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]], [[East Africa]], [[The Gambia]], the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]], [[Northern Nigeria]], the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Northern Territories of the Gold Coast]], [[Nyasaland]], [[Northern Rhodesia]], [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Somaliland]], [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern Nigeria]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Swaziland]], [[Uganda]] and [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]]. The Copyright Act 1911 was extended to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] by an [[Order in Council]] in 1924, it was extended to [[Tanganyika]] by an [[Order in Council]] in 1924 and 1931, it was extended to the [[Federated Malay States]] by an [[Order in Council]] in 1931 and 1932, and it was extended to the [[British Cameroons|Cameroons under British Mandate]] by an [[Order in Council]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Patridge| first = R.

== Influence of the act ==
The Copyright Act 1911 provided the template for an approach to [[copyright exceptions]] where a specific list of exceptions carefully defines permitted uses of the copyrighted work. The 1911 Act formed the basis of [[UK copyright law]] and, as an imperial measure, formed the basis for copyright law in most of what were then [[British Empire|British colonies and dominions]]. While many of these countries have had their own [[copyright law]] for a considerable number of years, most have followed the imperial model developed in 1911. [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]] and [[South Africa]] define the limits on and exceptions to copyright by providing an exhaustive list of specifically defined exceptions.&lt;ref name="Burrell 2005 249"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Burrell| first = Robert|author2=Alison Coleman | title = Copyright exceptions: the digital impact| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2005| pages = 249| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=Vu5n-ARorC0C&amp;dq=%22copyright+act+1911%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-84726-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commonwealth approach to exceptions ===
This "Commonwealth approach" to copyright is in contrast with that adopted in [[US copyright law]]. US copyright does contain a number of specific exceptions, as well as providing for a [[fair use]] defence in section 107 of the [[Copyright Act 1976]]. The Section provides a list of illustrative example of uses under this defence, such as criticism, comment and research. In contrast to the Commonwealth [[fair dealing]] exceptions, the fair use defence allows US courts to find that a defendant's use is fair and hence not an infringement of copyright, even though the use does not fall within the statutory list provided for in Section 107.&lt;ref name="Burrell 2005 249"/&gt;

[[File:Ci581 pek.JPG|right|thumb|200px|On January 29, 2005 [[China Airlines]] Flight 581 took off from [[Taoyuan International Airport]] and landed at [[Beijing International Airport]]]]

The '''cross-strait charters''' ({{zh|t=兩岸包機|s=两岸包机|p=liǎng'àn bāojī}}) are special flights between Taiwan and Mainland China, across the [[Taiwan Strait]]. After the [[Chinese Civil War]], no direct flights were allowed between Taiwan and Mainland China due to mistrust and security concerns; this remained the case until 2003. Passengers had to transfer in a third city, such as [[Hong Kong]], to complete their trip.

For the years 2003 and 2005, the scheme was restricted for the [[Chinese New Year]] period, so it was then called the '''Lunar New Year cross-strait charter''' ({{zh|t=兩岸春節包機|s=两岸春节包机|p=liǎng'àn chūnjié bāojī|links=no}}) in Taiwan, and the '''charter for Taiwan residents''' ({{zh|t=臺灣居民包機|s=台湾居民包机|p=táiwān jūmín bāojī|links=no}}) in [[Mainland China]]. For these years, the scheme was restricted for Taiwanese businessmen and their family members (excluding students and tourists) who are in Mainland China to travel to and from Taiwan.

In 2006, the service was opened to all residents of Taiwan for the first time. From the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] on 2006, the valid period of the agreement was expanded to four main Chinese festivals: [[Qingming Festival]], [[Duanwu Festival|Dragon Boat Festival]], [[Mid-Autumn Festival]], and the original [[Chinese New Year]].

In July 2008, charter flights expanded to weekends. Flight restrictions on nationalities were removed and Mainland China residents as well as foreign citizens were able to take the flights.

In November 2008, flights became daily instead only for the weekends. 108 weekly flights were established and the planes no longer had to travel through Hong Kong airspace, cutting travel times by two thirds in some cases such as flying from [[Taipei]] to [[Shanghai]].

In April 2009, a new agreement was reached to allow cross-strait flights to become regularly scheduled instead of chartered. The cap on the flights was also raised to 270 flights per week, effective 31 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090426-700018.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430102402/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090426-700018.html |archivedate=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 May 2010, another 100 additional weekly flights were permitted to be operated effective 14 June 2010, and [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport]] and [[Shijiazhuang Zhengding International Airport|Shijiazhuang Airport]] were added to the list of allowed destinations.&lt;ref&gt;http://atwonline.com/airports-routes/news/chinese-carriers-expected-operate-more-cross-straits-flights-0524&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1284453&amp;lang=eng_news&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
There was no official contact for over 50 years between the governments of Taiwan — where the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) had retreated — and Mainland China since the [[Communist Party of China]] established the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, after the Chinese Civil War. However, when the [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|Chinese Economic Reform]] began welcoming foreign funds in the 1980s, Mainland China sought greater contact with Taiwan. [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] refused, beginning a policy of "[[Three Noes]]". The Three Noes policy was abandoned, however, when a Taiwan flight was hijacked and Taiwan was forced to negotiate with Mainland China, beginning a series of negotiations. Merchants started investing in Mainland China and people visited their relatives. Air traffic between Taiwan and Mainland China grew dramatically, but no direct flights were allowed. Passengers traveling to Mainland China had to travel via an intermediate destination such as Hong Kong or [[Macau]], or via [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]. The travel time usually took more than a half day, especially during the holidays such as the [[Chinese New Year|Spring Festival]].

In the 1990s, the government of Mainland China proposed the 'three direct links' - including direct air flights between Mainland China and Taiwan - to ease the travel problem.  However, Taiwanese government rejected this idea.

In 2002, Taiwan legislator [[John Chiang (Taiwan)|John Chiang]] proposed that there should be special charters across the strait, and received support from the public and the aviation industry in Taiwan.

==The talks==
The previous regime of negotiations via the [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] and the [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] had broken down by the time [[Chen Shui-bian]] came to office. A political impasse prevented the resumption of semi-official dialogue, because the People's Republic of China government insisted on the recognition of the [[one China policy|one China principle]] or the more ambiguous [[1992 consensus]] as the basis for the talks. By contrast, the Republic of China government under [[Chen Shui-bian]] did not recognise the [[one China policy|one China principle]] and repudiated the [[1992 consensus]] reached under the previous administration. As a result, aviation industry bodies were accredited by the respective governments to negotiate only on the technical and operational aspects of the charter flights.

The governmental bodies politically responsible for the talks were the [[ROC Affairs Office]] of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]], led by [[Chen Yunlin]].

From 2000 to 2008, progress of talks were often severely affected by the political climate in Taiwan. After the re-election of the Chen Shui-bian government in 2004, the talks for the 2004 Chinese New Year charter flights were aborted when the PRC government was offended by Chen's independence-leaning rhetoric talks.

===Aviation industry===
Aviation companies operated at a huge loss for the 2003 charter flights due to the fact that all passengers could only travel one-way - that is, the flights traveled with no passengers for half the journey. Moreover, due to complicated procedures set out in the talks, the aviation companies could not hold direct-flights and had to travel through Hong Kong or Macau, greatly increasing their cost.  Nonetheless, the aviation companies were glad to provide the services, in part due to the historical nature and in part due to the possible promotional benefits from participating in the events, which were widely reported by the media.

===Reaction in Taiwan and in Mainland China===
The [[Pan-Blue coalition]], which led the talks from Taiwan, supported the charter flights. The majority Pan-Green coalition, however, saw it as "step towards reunification " which Taiwanese people do not prefer and criticized the Pan-Blue coalition for holding talks with the PRC without government permissions. The Taiwanese public at large, and especially the merchants who benefited the most, supported the charter flights, and the Pan-Blue coalition benefited from the positive response.

==2003 Charters==
*Time Period: January 26 to February 10, 2003
*Number of flights: 16
*Passengers: ROC businesspersons only
*Destinations: Shanghai &lt;-&gt; Taipei, Kaohsiung
*Airlines: Six Taiwanese carriers
*Number of Travelers: approximate 2600
*Feature: One way only, with a mandatory stop-over

===Events===
*October 27, 2002: ROC legislator John Chiang proposed '''The Project of Mainland Taiwanese Businesspeople Returning Home''', the project of "the direct charter". He said that Taiwanese airliners should be allowed to carry merchants back to Taipei at certain times, between selected airports, during the Lunar New Year.
*October 30, 2002: [[Taiwan Affairs Office|The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council]] stated their willingness to help Taiwan merchants return home. The PRC claimed the idea of equality and mutual benefit, hoping that PRC carriers could also provide services; however, the ROC government disagreed.
*December 4, 2002: The ROC government established regulations for allowing ROC business people to return to Mainland China:
:#Only ROC operators could fly the routes during the Chinese New Year as a charter.
:#Flights may only originate in Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek International Airport ([[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport]]) and [[Kaohsiung International Airport]], and may only arrive in [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport]] or [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]].
:#Charters must have at least one stopover in either Hong Kong or Macau, with no traffic between the stopover and both Taiwan and Mainland China cities.
:#Passengers may only be merchants and their families.
*Between late 2002 to early 2003, six Taiwanese airlines applied to run the charters.
*On January 26, 2003, at 3:55 am, [[China Airlines]] flight 585 operated with a [[Boeing 747]] departed from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport of Taipei. The crew consisted of pilots '''Zhang Yisong''' and '''Chen Beibei''' on board.  After a stop in Hong Kong, the aircraft landed successfully at Shanghai Pudong International Airport at 8:52 am, and became the first legal Taiwanese aircraft to land in Mainland China for more than 54 years.
*On 11:15 am, a China Airlines flight carrying 222 passengers took off from Pudong International Airport and arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at 3:40am with a short stop in Hong Kong.
*On the same day, [[TransAsia Airways]] flight 386, an [[Airbus A320]], left Taipei with no passengers at 8:20, and reached Shanghai at 12:40 pm via Macau. The return flight with 137 passengers departed Shanghai at 2 pm, and arrived Kaohsiung at 6:15 with a stopover in Macau.
*On February 9, China Airlines flight 585 was the last flight of the 2003 Lunar New Year charter services. The flight arrived with 237 travelers on board in Pudong International Airport at 11:14 pm the same day.

The period of 16 charter flights occurred between January 26 and February 9, 2003.

===Flight details===
*China Airlines (CAL) operated the first flight. Due to the one-way-only service restriction, only the crew,  securities of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (ROC side), two officers of the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], and 14 CAL staff were on board the  Taipei-Shanghai section for the first flights ceremony.
*After coming to a complete standstill, staff at [[Pudong International Airport]] showed a huge red banner with the words "{{lang|zh|热烈欢迎中华航空公司包机首航上海}}" ''(Ardently welcome CAL's First charter flight to Shanghai)''. A "[[Lion Dance]]" show was held.
*CAL [[Chief executive officer]] Wei, Philip Hsing-Hsiung (present Chairman) and crew waved their hands in greeting when stepping out the aircraft.
*Due to the sensitive state and the problem on using the ''[[Taiwan Compatriot Pass]]'', the vice secretary of the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], Zhi-Hong Jam({{lang|zh|詹志宏}}) did not attend the celebration but stayed in the aircraft after a short salutation.
*At C.K.S. International Airport, Taipei, CAL arranged a small ceremony to salute the first passengers. Then CAL Chairman Lee, Yun-Ning said "It's better to have direct flight as soon as possible. It's better to have it from tomorrow."
*The greeting ceremony was different in Kaohsiung. Numerous police were inside the terminal waiting for TransAsia's flight back to Kaohsiung.

==2005 Charters==
*Time Period: January 26 to February 20, 2005
*Number of flights: 48
*Passengers: Mainly businesspeople, some tourists and overseas students
*Destinations: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou &lt;-&gt; Taipei, Kaohsiung
*Airlines: Six Taiwanese carriers and six Chinese airlines
*Number of travelers: more than 10,000
*Features: Both way available without any stopover

===Events===
*There was no charter service in 2004 for several reasons, including the ROC presidential election in which the independence-leaning [[Pan-Green coalition]] was re-elected.
*In December 2004, [[John Chiang (Taiwan)|John Chiang]] expressed high expectations for the 2005 charter.
*January 2, 2005, the spokesperson of [[Taiwan Affairs Office|The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council]] proclaimed that they do care for the accomplishment of 2005 charters. They also demanded that the services this time should be operated as round-trip, non-stop service by airlines of both side with an increased number of destinations. They suggested the civil airlines negotiate with each other on technical and operational problems.
*January 9, 2005, '''Mission Animating the Tai-merchants Charters''' led by John Chiang arrived [[Beijing]].
*January 10, 2005, [[Chen Yunlin]], minister of the Taiwan Affairs Office (PRC), delegate of the General Administration of Civil Aviation (PRC) met during the mission. Chen said he would urge to carry the air links into reality.
*January 11, 2005, During the conference, the PRC aspect hoped the available airports could include [[Taichung Airport|Taichung]]. But the proposal was rejected by the ROC because Taichung Airport is an air force base. The ROC aspect hoped the destinations could be more than Beijing and original [[Shanghai]], like [[Guangzhou]], [[Xiamen]], [[Chongqing]], and [[Shenzhen]]. The ROC also wished that flights could fly through [[Okinawa]] [[Flight Information Region]] in order to reduce the unnecessarily lengthy flight time. The PRC refused the rearward in avoiding the charters being considered as international flights. They only permitted the flights go via the air space of Hong Kong and Macau.
*January 15, the civil operators came to terms. The agreement is as follows,
:#Time Period: January 29~February 20, 2005.
:#Restricted destinations: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou &lt;-&gt; Taipei, Kaohsiung
:#Airlines on both side could apply the charters to the related governmental departments on the opposite side. Charters would operated in the type of "Both-joining, directly non-stop, carrying passengers both ways (round-trip), and more dots (means destinations in Chinese) included".
:#Only Tai-merchants could take the flights.
:#Planes had to go through the Hong Kong [[Flight Information Region]] without landing.
*Between January 29 and February 20, 2005, twelve mainland Chinese and Taiwanese airlines flew 48 charters.
*At 7:46 am on January 29, [[Air China]] Flight 1087 was the first flight to depart Mainland China with 88 passengers. [[China Airlines]] flight 581 was the first to depart Taiwan aircraft from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in Taipei.
*At 9:20 am, [[China Southern Airlines]] Flight 3097, originating in Guangzhou, arrived Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport in Taipei. China Southern became the first airline landing Taiwan legally after the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The reason why the earliest-departed was not the earliest-arrived is that Guangzhou, which the city is located in the southern province of [[Guangdong]], is far closer to Taiwan than the northern Beijing.
*On February 20, the last charter of the year, Hainan Airlines flight 7952 arrived Beijing Capital International Airport at 9:30pm.

===Flight records===
The six mainland Chinese airlines originated in three cities in Mainland China: [[Beijing]] ([[Air China]], [[Hainan Airlines]]), [[Shanghai]] ([[China Eastern Airlines]]), and [[Guangzhou]] ([[China Southern Airlines]], [[Xiamen Airlines]]). All Air China's flight are operated by [[Shandong Airlines]]' aircraft to avoid Air China's livery which features the "Five Star Red Flag".

The Taiwanese airlines were the same as in 2003. Most Taiwanese flights departed for Guangzhou ([[TransAsia Airways]]), and [[Kaohsiung]] was mainly serviced by [[Uni Air]].

===Flight details===
*This was the first time in which mainland Chinese airlines were allowed to fly the charters, which was why the mainland Chinese carriers were more zealous in preparing the flights. Airlines in Taiwan, however, thought that the preparing time was shorter than that of 2003. Moreover, many merchants had already bought tickets of flights which needed stopovers in Hong Kong or Macau. The Taiwanese airlines therefore postponed their launching date to that closer to New Year's Eve.
*Chinese carrier were more "first-flight-bashing" than Taiwanese. They labored over it hoping to be the first mainland Chinese airlines arriving Taiwan. Original, [[Air China|Air China (CA)]] arranged the outbound plane leaving at 4:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., January 29, 2005. But they adjust the time to eight o'clock in the morning. It made CA the first-left airlines. However, they departed 14 minutes earlier than the scheduled 8:00, and that caused a "delayed" passenger to miss his flight. He was angry about CA's arrangement.
*Geographically, [[Guangzhou]] is closer to Taiwan than any other major mainland Chinese city, so the [[China Southern Airlines]]' (CZ) flight '''CZ3097''' which departed at 8:00 became the first P. R. Chinese plane touching down in Taiwan. Because Guangzhou is the base of CZ, on January 29, '''CZ3097''' had a greater celebration ceremony than the [[Xiamen Airlines]]'s flight '''MF881''', which parked beside it, leaving 15 minutes later.
*[[Air China]] used the rented aircraft from [[Shandong Airlines]] that time.  The reason might be that all CA aircraft have the [[Flag of the People's Republic of China|Five-Starred Red Flag]] and word "{{lang|zh|國際}}" meaning "International" on them. they wanted to avoid the charters being confounded with the international flights. Though Taipei aspect said that it was acceptable, CA or the Mainland China aspect was still not willing to do so. They used Shandong Airlines's aircraft with repainted "{{lang|zh|國航}}" words (abbreviation of ''Air China'' without the original "International" meaning in Chinese) with no flag at the end.
*All mainland Chinese carriers flew faster than expected. Take CA for example, the charter to Taipei and Kaohsiung landed at 11:33 and 11:35 am, both an hour earlier. [[Hainan Airlines]]' flight from Beijing to Taipei arrived 33 minutes beforehand. [[China Eastern Airlines|China Eastern]] forwarded 30 minutes from Shanghai to Taipei. [[Shanghai Airlines]] was 17 minutes ahead of time. Hainan Airlines was 33 mins ahead of schedule. CZ and Xiamen Airlines both antedated 4 mins. The CA captain Zhou, Ning said it was because that passengers have had boarded fast as the result of early took-off. And by the time passing Hong Kong FIR, the control centre asked them to go faster. So they arrived earlier. Meanwhile, as confided, the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] regulated charters should go pass above the [[Hong Kong International Airport]]. Nevertheless, CAD (Civil Aviation Department) of Hong Kong did not response. So the flights follow the notice from CAD for "continuation of international flights". This meant that the flights no longer needed to pass through the surrounding area of Hong Kong International Airport. Direct flights from [[Shantou]] can now pass through [[Xiamen]] and [[Fuzhou]] to final destination, [[Shanghai]]. Another reason for shorter flight time is due to seasonal winds.
*The above promoter, ROC legislator [[John Chiang (Taiwan)|John Chiang]], was not allowed to travel the cross-strait charter due to his non-merchants dignity. He had to transfer to another flight for Beijing at Hong Kong for the launch ceremony. He said in jest, "Maybe I should have a [[soy milk]] store in Beijing so that I could be a Taiwan merchant!"
* China Southern Captain How, Jien-hwa ({{lang|zh|郝建華}}) confided that when the first-arrived-in-Taiwan charter flight ''CZ3097'' reached the Taipei Flight Information Region, he and the controller communicated in Chinese most of the time with very little English. In particular, at the time approaching the airport, the Mandarin euphony "{{lang|zh|歡迎來到台北}}" (Welcome to Taipei!) from the ground sounded especially accommodative. At 8:47 am when the aircraft entered the Taiwan airspace and Captain How proclaimed the information, the passengers celebrated. How then said a few words representing the exhilaration that all on board had, "The same sky, the same agog spirit" ({{lang|zh|一樣的天空，激動的心情}})
*Each airline company chose the best pilots and crews for these flights. The cuisine was specially designed to suit passengers tastes. Planes with special liveries were also chosen for the charter flights.
**About the aircraft, Hainan Airlines took ''National Beauty'' and ''Golden wheat, the Harvest'' as the topic of its painting on the plane. At the same time, TransAsia Airways painted the Hong Kong actress [[Carina Lau]] on their plane, and invited her to be their [[spokesperson]]. Many other airlines also decorated the cabin with plenty Chinese decorations representing the Chinese New Year.
**Commodore for the first flight: The first landed China Southern flight was flown by Captain How, Jien-hwa. He was the general manager of China Southern, who has been flying for over 36 years. In 2003, he was even Captain of the flight to [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], which was carrying the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Tang, Jia-xuan (唐家璇).
**The "First Charter-to-go" for Air China was flown by Captain Yibin Gin, aged 37, the captain of the third pilot crew (第三飛行大隊) in the company. He was the youngest captain of a pilot crew throughout the nation, having been flying for 16 years and over ten thousand hours.
**The first flight captains for China Airlines were Hsiaoping Wang (王曉平), Menghsian Ma (馬孟先), and copilot Sun Hui-Chün (孫慧君), a woman. EVA Airways' first flight captain was Tso Wei-kang (左惟康), who had also flown the 2003 charters.
**Flight attendants were all the best of the best of each carrier: airlines picked the very best elite crews to serve passengers on  New Year charters. They need to speak excellent Mandarin and [[Min Nan|Taiwanese]]. As the charters for Lunar New Year, airlines also designed special uniform corresponding to the holiday.
**Being the first Taiwanese carrier arriving in Guangzhou, TransAsia Airways sent for the welcoming ceremony their own cheerleaders with banners on which "Hello Guangzhou!" was written. The TransAsia cheerleaders are made up with its flight attendants and usually cheer on Taiwanese baseball teams.
**On board some flights, flight attendants put on performances. The cabin crew on Air China sang chorally the famous Taiwanese song "Grandma's Penghu Bay" (外婆的澎湖灣), and played the Chinese nursery rhymes "[[Mo Li Hua|The Jasmine Flowers]]" on the saxophone. Attendants on Xiamen Airlines greeted passengers in [[Min Nan]], showing that their home base, [[Fujian Province]] has a close kinship with Taiwan both geographically and demographically.
**Meals on board also became a spotlight. Airlines catering departments had invented special menus, with the following:

*Although the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] had ruled that only Taiwanese merchants and their family would be able to use the charters, many beyond the regulation were also on board, including tourists, students, journalists, and even Filipino domestic helpers who are not even Taiwanese residents. The reason might be, according to some, that Taiwanese merchant certificates are quite accessible through most Taiwanese merchants associations.
*Not every chartered flight was full. On February 5, the [[Far Eastern Air Transport]] flight EF666 from [[Taipei]] to [[Guangzhou]] had only four passengers on board. Taiwanese merchant Ms. Lai and her family traveled from [[Wuhan]], [[Hubei]] on a [[Xiamen Airlines]] flight back to Taipei on January 29, and then on a Far Eastern Air Transport flight to Guangzhou on February 5. Ms. Lai and her family (four passengers total) and a flight crew of 20.

==One-Way/round-trip argument==
As the charter flight was only for Taiwanese merchants returning home for the [[Chinese New Year]], there would not be a demand to travel from Taiwan to Mainland China before the New Year's Day. Neither would there be people needing to travel on the flights from Mainland China to Taiwan that operated on dates after the New Year period.

In order to make sure the original purpose was not violated, in the 2003 case, the ROC government ensured that passengers could only travel one way, that meant no one was allowed to fly from Taiwan to Mainland China before the festival, and no one could travel on the return flight after the festival.

However, since the 2005 charters, the ROC government later approved of passengers traveling the entire round-trip though there were still other limits.

==2006 Charters==
*Time span: January 20, 2006 to February 13, 2006
*Number of flights: 36 flights in each direction, 72 flights in total
*Main target: Taiwanese residents
*Cities served: PRC -- [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Xiamen]] ; ROC -- [[Taipei]], [[Kaohsiung]]
*Airlines: 6 airline companies from ROC and PRC
**PRC -- [[Air China]], [[China Eastern Airlines]], [[China Southern Airlines]], [[Shanghai Airlines]], [[Xiamen Airlines]], [[Hainan Airlines]]
**ROC -- [[China Airlines]], [[Eva Air]], [[Mandarin Airlines]], [[Uni Air]], [[TransAsia Airways]], [[Far Eastern Air Transport]]
*Number of passengers: To be tabulated
*Features: Direct flights to and from Mainland China, passing through Hong Kong [[Flight Information Region]]

===Events===
*November 18, 2005：vice director-general of Cross-Straits Aviation Transport Exchange Council (海峡两岸航空运输交流委员会) [[Pu Zhaozhou]] said at the news conference of [[Taiwan Affairs Office|the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council]] that the plan for 2006 charters has been confirmed.
*January 20, 2006: 07:06am, [[China Airlines]] flight CI 585, the earliest-departed charter, took off at the Taipei Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport, and arrived Shanghai at around noon. The returning flight (same aircraft with new flight number - CI586) included a Taiwanese [[motor neurone disease]] patient, the 1960s singer [[Ye Ling]] (葉彩育). The ROC's Mainland Affairs Council also permitted two mainland Chinese paramedic to take the charter to assist the patient. This was also the first time for heavily-injured people to be able to travel home directly across the strait for their treatment. China Airlines, especially for her, ripped six seats in a row with two left. The spare space was for her stretcher's settlement; this made Ye's way home comfortable. "My Wife couldn't make her way back to Taiwan if there had not been the charters!" her husband said appreciatively.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/simp/hi/newsid_4630000/newsid_4630900/4630932.stm 两岸包机直航首开载重症病患返台]." ''[[BBC]] Chinese''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*2006 was the first time for adding [[Xiamen]] to be a destination.

===Flight details===
*Different from the great reactions in 2005, media and airlines took the 2006 one much less seriously. The airline operating the first-departed charter, [[China Airlines]], did not hold any ceremony; it only saw the charter as a normal commercial flight. Quantity of news reports from both sides of the strait was less than the previous one. Only the Taiwanese [[Eastern Television]] and the mainland Chinese [[China Central Television|CCTV]] have had some reports on news programs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
*Specially-designed aircraft was the focus of this year. Most airlines sent out their aircraft with special livery to fly the routes:
**[[Air China]] used a [[Boeing 737-700]] aircraft which registration number is [http://www.airliners.net/open.file/988256/M/ B-5202] with logos and slogan, One World, One Dream, of [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]] on it.
**[[EVA Air]] used an [[Airbus A330]] aircraft, registration number [http://www.airliners.net/open.file/987695/M/ B-16303], which has [[Hello Kitty]] characters painted on it. It flew the Taipei - Beijing route.
**[[Hainan Airlines]]' "Happy Waves" (快樂海浪) special-painted plane operated the Beijing-Taipei flight, symbolizing the cheerful setting sail.
**[[Far Eastern Air Transport]] flew to Xiamen with their painted plane "unlimited dignity", showing respect to all charter passengers.

==2008 Humanitarian flights==
Date: May 16, 2008

Airlines: [[EVA Air]] (Chongqing), [[China Airlines]] (Chongqing), [[TransAsia Airways]] (Chongqing), [[Mandarin Airlines]] (Chengdu)

Due to the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|Sichuan earthquake]], many Taiwan travelers were unable to get flights out of the quake region. Both governments reached a deal and chartered four flights to depart from [[Chengdu]] and [[Chongqing]] to Taiwan on May 16, 2008.

==2008 Charters==
[[File:Cross-strait charters weekends08.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Route Map of the weekend Cross-strait charter, for flights as of August, 2008.]]

Under the agreement reached on June 13, 2008, charter flights began on weekends starting July 4, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7488965.stm |title=Direct China-Taiwan flights begin |publisher=BBC |date=2008-07-04 |accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 18 flights per weekend (Friday to Monday) are allowed under this agreement. Unlike previous charters, anyone with legal traveling documents, regardless of nationality, was allowed to travel on these charter flights. Initially, Mainland China permitted flights from [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]] ([[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Pudong Airport]]), [[Guangzhou]], [[Xiamen]], and [[Nanjing]] airports, and the plan was to permit flights from [[Chengdu]], [[Chongqing]], [[Dalian]], [[Guilin]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Shenyang]], [[Xian]] and other spots with market demand in the future, while the ROC government permitted flights from [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|Taiwan Taoyuan Airport]], [[Taipei Songshan Airport]], [[Kaohsiung International Airport|Kaohsiung]], [[Taichung]], [[Makung]], [[Hualien City|Hualien]], [[Kinmen]], and [[Taitung City|Taitung]].

On July 4, 2008, the first flight carrying 230 passengers belonging to [[China Southern Airlines]] arrived at [[Taoyuan International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/07/04/China-taiwan.html |title=Historic China-Taiwan flights a sign of warming relations |publisher=[[CBC News|CBC]] |date=2008-07-04 |accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three Links==
Started on 15 December 2008, direct flights, direct shippings and direct mail are fully restored between Mainland China and Taiwan per the [[Three Links]] agreement. It marks the end of cross-strait charter flights and marks the beginning of regular scheduled flights. Shanghai and Taipei Area Control Center can pass traffic to each other at SULEM{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} in the northern flight path while no direct pass-off for southern flight path.

'''Directive on intra-EU-transfers of defence-related products''' (officially: Directive 2009/43/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[Council of the European Union]] of 6 May 2009 simplifying terms and conditions of transfers of defence-related products within the Community) is a [[European Union Directive]] with relevance for the [[European Economic Area (EEA)]]. It is also known as the "ICT-Directive". 

The Directive entered into force at the end of June in 2009. The deadline for transposition in the Member States was 30 June 2011. The national laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive shall apply  from 30 June 2012 (Article 18). There is also an amending act, the Directive 2010/80/EU. With this act the Annex to Directive 2009/43/EC was amended.&lt;ref&gt;see Directive 2010/80/EU http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/defence/files/directive_2010_80_eu_-_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Directive 2009/43/EC defines a "European licence system" for the transfer of defence-related-products within the [[European Union]]. Defence-related products mean any products listed in the Annex of the Directive.&lt;ref&gt;see Annex of the Directive 2009/43/EC http://eurlex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:146:0001:0036:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; All these products correspond to those listed in the Common Military List of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;see Common Military List of the European Union http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2011:086:0001:0036:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objective of the Directive 2009/43/EC is to build an [[internal market]] for defence-related products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+IM-PRESS+20081216IPR44603+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN - European Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and objectives==
The [[member states of the European Union]] each have their own licensing system concerning the export of defence-related products. There are differences in terms of procedures, scope and duration.&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/businesses/intellectual_property/l33288_en.htm - Europa&lt;/ref&gt; These disparities can destroy the competitiveness of European defence industry and can create barriers that hamper exports of defence-related products in the internal market.&lt;ref&gt;see Commission 2007, 765 p 1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2007:0765:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Article 1 of the Directive "the aim of the directive is to simplify the rules and procedures applicable to the intra-EU-transfer of defence-related products in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market"&lt;ref&gt;see Article 1 of the Directive 2009/43/EC http://eurlex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:146:0001:0036:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the conditions for SMEs’ participation in armament development and production shall be improved. In addition with respect to this Directive, the [[European Commission|Commission]] intends to increase the industrial cooperation of defence-related products to generate [[economies of scale]] &lt;ref&gt;see Commission 2007 765, p 4 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2007:0765:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the Directive aims to facilitate the intra-EU-transfer of defence-related products and to improve the competitiveness of the European defence industry on an international level.&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/businesses/intellectual_property/l33288_en.htm - Europa&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior authorisation==
In accordance with Article 4 of the Directive the movement of defence-related products between EU Member States is subject to prior authorisation. For the whole intra-EU-transfer only one transfer licence is necessary. There are three types of export licences: the general transfer licence; the global transfer licence as well as the individual transfer licence. The individual transfer licences would remain the exception.&lt;ref&gt;see Commission 2007, 765, p 7 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2007:0765:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global transfer licence===
According to Article 6 of the Directive a global transfer licence shall be granted on request to individual suppliers. With such a licence the supplier can deliver products to one or more recipients in other Member States during a period of three years. The licence is renewable.

===Individual transfer licence===
Article 7 of the Directive describes the usage of an individual transfer licence. Such a licence shall be granted on request. With an individual transfer licence a supplier can deliver products only once to only one recipient in another Member State.

===General transfer licence===
According to Article 5 of the Directive general transfer licences are granted ex officio. A request for them is not needed. All movements, which meet the given legal conditions of the licence, are authorized automatically.
 
Such licences give suppliers the chance and the opportunity to export different kinds of defence-related products to different recipients placed in different Member States without a request. 

Under Article 5 of the Directive general transfer licences shall be published at least in the following cases:

For transfer
* to certified recipients;
* to the armed forces of other Member States;
* for demonstration, evaluation or exhibition purposes;
* for maintenance and repair purposes.

==Certification of recipients==
Article 9 of the Directive lays down the rules for the "certification of recipients" and provides some criteria, which have to be considered during the certification process. Furthermore there is the [[Commission Recommendation]] 2011/24/EU on the certification of defence undertakings under Article 9 of Directive 2009/43/EC.
In each Member State there is a competent authority, which has to carry out the certification of companies based on certain criteria. If a company is certified, suppliers from other Member States can deliver defence-related products to this company by using a general transfer licence. The certification will be valid for five years.

==Obligations to suppliers==
Article 8 (3) of the Directive foresees the obligation for the suppliers to keep certain records of their transfers. 

According to Article 8 (1,2) of the Directive suppliers have to inform 
* recipients of the terms and conditions of the transfer licence.
* the competent authoritiy of their intention to use a general transfer licence for the first time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7594">'''Endowment tax''' is a US [[taxation]] of some [[Financial endowment|endowment]]s. Typically endowment payments, because of their attachment to non-profit organizations, are not taxed. Endowments can be up to several billion dollars at some of the richest [[universities]] in the United States.  The [[non-profit]] status of some institutions like hospitals has been questioned in the United States [[House Ways and Means Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ways and Means Questions Nonprofit Hospitals' Tax Status|work=|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund  1 East 75th Street, New York, NY|date=|url=http://www.cmwf.org/healthpolicyweek/healthpolicyweek_show.htm?doc_id=278529|format=Web|doi=|accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite paper|author=Jill Horwitz|title=Testimony Before House Ways and Means Committee|version=|publisher=|date=2005-05-26|url=http://www.sph.umich.edu/cleh/papers/horwitz.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As enacted in the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] and amended by the [[Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018]], a proposed excise tax of 1.4% will be levied on endowments supported by institutions who have  at least 500 tuition-paying students with a resulting net asset of $500,000 per student. In turn, without adjusting the $500,000 for inflation, more institutions will result in being subject to this tax over time. Thus the tax applies to the wealthiest large institutions as well as some smaller colleges with small enrollments as of present day.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/01/02/wealthy-colleges-face-uncertainty-they-seek-ways-avoid-new-endowment-tax&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a donation made to an endowment fund can be tax-deductible for those who give the contribution.

==Historical precedents==
The city of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], has proposed taxing [[MIT]] and other major universities on these previously exempt, non-profit earnings, however most organizations still fight against the introduction of this tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=He|first=Ray C.|title=Cambridge Seeks to Tax Earnings on Endowment|work=Volume 125, Number 44|publisher=''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]''|date=October 4, 2005|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V125/N44/cambsurcharge.html|format=Web|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical forms==

* Taxable allowance

When a donation exceeds 50 percent of the donor's adjusted gross income (AGI), the IRS will limit the amount of money donated by the donor.
Some donors are likely to have a 20% to 30% tax exemption, and marital status may affect that amount, so it is best to consult a tax adviser before making a big charitable donation.
In addition, the life insurance death claim donation is not restricted by AGI.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Enders, Tax Incentives: An Economic Basis for Charitable Giving, http://learningtogive.org/papers/paper63.html(Last view June 6, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* In-kind donations

In addition to donating money, many charities accept donations in kind, such as cars, houses and art.
When a donation is made in kind, the donor must demonstrate the value of the donation in the open market to obtain the corresponding allowance.
 
* Accrued asset donation
Before donating to an asset that has increased in value since the purchase, it is important to consider whether it is better to donate directly to the asset or to donate after the sale.
Direct donations can be taxed at the original purchase price without paying more tax on any potential profits.&lt;ref&gt;Boris I. Bittker, Charitable Contributions: Tax Deductions or Matching Grants? 28 TAX L. REV.37,1972
&lt;/ref&gt;

* Stock donation
If a donor receives an income tax credit on the day's value of the share transfer, he does not have to pay VAT on the added value of the donated stock.
And after giving away the stock, the donor can buy back the stock at any time, so if you can buy back the stock, it will bring a significant amount of income.
But only 30 percent of the tax allowance is given, often less than cash donations.
 
* Real estate donation
A property held for more than a year can be used as a charitable donation to be taxed at market prices.
The allowance is 30% of the adjusted gross income, but can be assessed within five years and can be deducted from the federal estate tax.
Donors at the same time, also need not pay property taxes, maintenance fees, property tax and donors after donation will also retain rights in their lifetime, just put the permanent transfer of the land can get tax breaks.
 
* Donation related expenses

The related expenses incurred in the donation can also be used to offset tax.
This is similar to the reimbursement of related expenses at work, which maximizes the benefit of the donor.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Taxation, Historical Development and Present Law of the Federal Tax Exemption for Charities and Other Tax- exempt Organizations, Report No. JCX-29-05,April 19, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endowment tax in China==
In order to encourage enterprises and individuals to donate to the public in the affected areas, the State Administration of Taxation stipulates that individuals should use their income for donation expenditures. The donation amount does not exceed 30% of the taxable income declared by the taxpayer, and the taxable income can be taxable from it. Deductions are made from the amount of income so as to offset part of the tax. The current tax law stipulates that public welfare donation expenses incurred by an enterprise shall be deducted from the calculation of taxable income in the portion of the total annual profit of less than 12%.&lt;ref&gt;http://economiclaw.whu.edu.cn/Public/static/ueditor/php/upload/20160512/1463022549125661.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* For enterprises:
Non-profit donations (through non-profit social organizations or the people's government departments at the county level and donations for prescribed public welfare undertakings) that occur in an enterprise can be used to calculate the amount of taxable income within 12% of the total annual profit.
* For individuals:
Individual donations for public welfare donations that don't exceed 30% of the taxable income can be deducted; individuals donate real estate in the following cases: The parties do not levy individual income tax: Free the housing property to the spouse, parents, children, and the like. The grandparents, grandchildren, grandchildren, brothers and sisters, who directly support or support the family, shall obtain the inheritor of the house property rights, the heirs to the testator, or the bequeathor according to law. In the case of the above, the recipient's donated income received from the unpaid house is paid personal income tax in accordance with the “Other income taxed by the financial department of the State Council.”

Individuals may pass their income through social groups and state agencies in China to education and other social public welfare undertakings, as well as donations that have suffered serious natural disasters in areas and impoverished areas. The donation amount does not exceed 30% of the taxable income declared by taxpayers. It is deducted from its taxable income.
Individuals donating to rural compulsory education through non-profit social organizations and state agencies are allowed to fully deduct the amount of income before the individual income tax is paid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1297">The '''Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure''' (officially abbreviated '''Fed. R. App. P.'''; colloquially '''FRAP''') are a set of rules, promulgated by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on recommendation of an advisory committee, to govern procedures in cases in the [[United States Courts of Appeals]]. 

The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure were originally adopted in 1967 and have been amended regularly since then.  Prior to 1967, some aspects of appellate procedure were covered in the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].  

In addition to these rules, procedure in the [[United States Courts of Appeals|Courts of Appeals]] is governed by applicable statutes (particularly [[Title 28 of the United States Code]]) and by local rules adopted by each individual court. Many of these local rules incorporate Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure by reference.

[[File:Furnival's Inn, Holborn - Shepherd, 1828.jpg|thumb|The rebuilt Furnival's Inn, as depicted by [[Thomas Hosmer Shepherd|Shepherd]] in 1828]]
'''Furnival's Inn''' was an [[Inn of Chancery]] which formerly stood on the site of the present [[Holborn Bars]] building (the former [[Prudential plc|Prudential Assurance Company]] building) in [[Holborn]], [[London]], England.

== History ==
[[File:142 Holborn Bars, London.jpg|thumb|[[Holborn Bars]] – former site of Furnival's Inn, built in phases between 1885 and 1901]]
Furnival's Inn was founded about 1383 when William de Furnival, 4th Lord Furnival leased a boarding facility to Clerks of Chancery, who prepared writs for the king’s courts, assisted by apprentices who, as such, received a preliminary legal training.
By the 15th century the Inns of Chancery had become preparatory schools for students wishing to be called to the bar by the Inns of Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/crace/g/007000000000015u00035000.html|title=Ground plan of Furnivals Inn|first=Colin|last=Wight|website=www.bl.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1548 it was affiliated to [[Lincoln's Inn]] through a long term lease. [[Sir Thomas More]] was Reader at the Inn from 1504 to 1507.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histparl.ac.uk/volume/1509-1558/member/more-thomas-i-147778-1535|title=MORE,   Thomas I (1477/78-1535),  of London and Chelsea, Mdx. - History of Parliament Online|website=www.histparl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the seventeenth century, the Inns of Chancery began to turn into societies for attorneys and solicitors; they became residences, offices and dining clubs.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;[http://www.literarylondon.org/london-journal/march2010/parker.html Parker, David. "Dickens, the Inns of Court, and the Inns of Chancery", ''The Literary London Journal'', March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The greater part of the old Inn was taken down in Charles I.'s time, and a new building erected in its stead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianlondon.org/legal/furnivalsinn.htm Cunningham, Peter. ''Hand-Book of London'', 1850]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it survived the [[Great Fire of London]], the Inn, together with the other Inns of Chancery, ceased to exist in the 19th century. According to the ''Gentleman's Magazine'' of June 1818, "'Furnival's Inn Cellar' was a place well known to the professional gentlemen, where a good dinner may be had at a reasonable price."&lt;ref&gt;[http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?&amp;action=GET&amp;textsid=39015 "Elegy written at Furnival's Inn", ''Gentleman's Magazine'', 88, June 1818, 544]&lt;/ref&gt; The Inn was dissolved as a society in 1817 when Lincoln's Inn did not renew its lease and the medieval building was demolished in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/gallery/92.html "Charles Dickens, Homes and other associated places", ''Victorian Web'', (George P. Landow, ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; The building was rebuilt as apartments by a new owner who retained the old name.

[[File:St Giles &amp; Holborn Civil Parish Map 1870.png|thumb|250px|left|A map showing the boundaries of the Inn in 1870.]]
[[Charles Dickens]] rented rooms here between December 1834 and throughout the first year of his marriage, until 1837. He began the ''[[Pickwick Papers]]'' while a tenant there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zXioBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=furnival's+inn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9flyXEF3Mf&amp;sig=WI4xKxTT9S3JrVNBFtkBjlUyzzM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwATgUahUKEwjple7M6fLIAhWCVD4KHftIBOQ#v=onepage&amp;q=furnival's%20inn&amp;f=false Cox, Helen. ''Mr. and Mrs. Charles Dickens Entertain at Home'', Elsevier, 2014] {{ISBN|9781483160450}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character John Westlock in ''Martin Chuzzlewit'' lives in Furnival’s Inn, and describes it as &lt;blockquote&gt;"...a shady, quiet place, echoing to the footsteps of the stragglers who have business there; and rather monotonous and gloomy on summer evenings. ... there are snug chambers in those Inns where the bachelors live, and, for the desolate fellows they pretend to be, it is quite surprising how well they get on".&lt;ref name=Parker /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[J.M. Barrie]] lived in a set of chambers at No. 7 Furnival's Inn from 1888 to 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mackail, ''The Story of J.M.B.'' (Peter Davies, 1941)&lt;/ref&gt;  The site was redeveloped again, in 1879, as the headquarters of the Prudential Assurance. A plaque marks the site where Furnival's Inn stood.

== Governance ==
Furnival's Inn was an area for local government partly in the [[City of London]] and partly in [[Middlesex]]. It was an [[extra-parochial area]] and became a [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in 1858 within the Holborn [[Poor Law Union]]. The part within the City of London was transferred to [[St Andrew Holborn]] in 1900. The remaining parish was part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Holborn]] from 1900 and was abolished as a civil parish in 1930.&lt;ref name="Youngs"&gt;{{cite book | first=Frederic |last=Youngs | title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England | volume=I: Southern England | year=1979 | publisher=[[Royal Historical Society]] | location=London | isbn=0-901050-67-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unpopulated after the construction of Holborn Bars.

Dr. [[Yaniv Erlich]] conducted a study in 2013 that revealed vulnerabilities in the security of public databases that contain genetic data.  Erlich's study reported a method to discover the identity of anonymous research subjects whose genomes had been sequenced as part of a genomics project.&lt;ref name=nature1&gt;{{cite web|title=Genetic privacy|url=http://www.nature.com/news/genetic-privacy-1.12238|publisher=Nature|accessdate=29 December 2016|pages=451–451|doi=10.1038/493451a|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, research subjects could sometimes be identified by their DNA alone. &lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/science/poking-holes-in-the-privacy-of-dna.html|title=Poking Holes in Genetic Privacy|last1=Kolata|first1=Gina|date=16 June 2013|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Bender Gerstein]], a [[Yale]] professor who studies large genetic databases notes that "research subjects who share their DNA may risk a loss of not just their own privacy but also that of their children and grandchildren, who will inherit many of the same genes".&lt;ref name=nytimes1/&gt;

Furthermore, the vast databases of corporations or states are susceptible to get [[data breach|breached]] by criminals or governments.&lt;ref name=nytimes1/&gt; There is a controversy regarding the responsibility that a [[DNA testing]] company has to ensure that [[data leak|leaks]] and breaches do not happen. Regulation rules are not clearly laid out. What is still not determined is who legally owns the genome information: the company or the individual whose genome has been read. There have been published examples of personal genome information being exploited.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=De Cristofaro|first=Emiliano|date=2012-10-17|title=Whole Genome Sequencing: Innovation Dream or Privacy Nightmare?|eprint=1210.4820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional privacy concerns, related to, e.g., [[genetic discrimination]], loss of anonymity, and psychological impacts, have been increasingly pointed out by the academic community&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/its-time-to-talk-about-who-can-access-your-digital-genomic-data-87682|title=It's time to talk about who can access your digital genomic data|last=Curtis|first=Caitlin|date=December 4, 2017|work=The Conversation|access-date=May 21, 2018|last2=Hereward|first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as government agencies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Dr. [[David Altshuler]] of the [[Broad Institute|Broad Institute of Harvard and M.I.T.]] notes that the amount of genetic data that has been gathered so far ({{as of|2013}}) is minuscule compared with what will be coming in the next few years{{when|date=March 2018}}, making it important to address the problems before the data deluge makes them worse, saying that they "see substantial issues" and "want to have serious discussions now".&lt;ref name=nytimes1/&gt;

The [[American Society of Human Genetics]] has brought up issues about administering genetic tests on children. Moreover, they infer that this could lead to negative consequences for the children. Some of the negative consequences that this could lead to include the child’s likelihood of getting adopted which as a result could lead the child to suffer from self esteem issues; the child’s well-being could also suffer because of things like paternity testing or a custody battle requiring this type of information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderlik|first=Mary R|last2=Rothstein|first2=Mark A.|date=2001|title=Privacy and Confidentiality of Genetic Information: What Rules for the New Science?|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.genom.2.1.401#_i20|journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|volume=2|pages=401-433|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
{{Expand section|date=January 2017|reason=Other countries than the US?!}}
A 2015 study found that state genetic [[privacy law]]s take three alternative approaches to protecting patient privacy: requiring informed consent on the part of the individual; restricting discriminatory usage of genetic data by employers, health care providers or insurance companies; or limiting redisclosure without the consent of the individual or defining genetic data as the 'property' of the individual" and that "giving users control over redisclosure encourage the spread of genetic testing, but that
the informed consent approach deters individuals from obtaining genetic tests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Privacy Protection, Personalized Medicine and Genetic Testing|url=https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_comments/2015/09/00010-97509.pdf|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the access of genetic information is regulated it can prevent [[insurance companies]] and employers from reaching such data. Further, this could avoid issues of discrimination which could oftentimes leave an individual whose information has been breached without a job or without insurance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===In the United States===
{{See also|Genetic policy in the United States}}
The [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] of 2008 (GINA) protects the genetic privacy of the public, including research participants. The passage of GINA makes it illegal for health insurers or employers to request or require genetic information of an individual or of family members (and further prohibits the discriminatory use of such information). More information on GINA is available here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy in Genomics|url=https://www.genome.gov/27561246/privacy-in-genomics/|publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, biomedical research containing human subjects is governed by a baseline standard of ethics known as [[Common Rule|The Common Rule]], which aims to protect a subject's privacy by requiring "identifiers" such as name or address to be removed from collected data.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioethics.gov/node/764|title=Privacy and Progress in Whole Genome Sequencing|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues|access-date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 report by the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]] stated, however, that "what constitutes 'identifiable' and 'de-identified' data is fluid and that evolving technologies and the increasing accessibility of data could allow de-identified data to become re-identified".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In fact, research has already shown that it is "possible to discover a study participant's identity by cross-referencing research data about him and his DNA sequence … [with] genetic genealogy and public-records databases".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Check Hayden|first=Erika|title=Privacy loophole found in genetic databases|url=http://www.nature.com/news/privacy-loophole-found-in-genetic-databases-1.12237|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.12237}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to calls for policy-makers to establish consistent guidelines and best practices for the accessibility and usage of individual genomic data collected by researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutmann|first=Amy|last2=Wagner|first2=James W.|date=2013-05-01|title=Found Your DNA on the Web: Reconciling Privacy and Progress|journal=Hastings Center Report|volume=43|issue=3|pages=15–18|doi=10.1002/hast.162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy protections for genetic research participants were strengthened by provisions of the [[21st Century Cures Act]] (H.R.34) passed on 7 December 2016 for which the [[American Society of Human Genetics]] (ASHG) commended Congress, [[Elizabeth Warren|Senator Warren]] and [[Mike Enzi|Senator Enzi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASHG Supports Genetic Privacy Provisions in 21st Century Cures Act {{!}} ASHG|url=http://www.ashg.org/press/201612-21CC.html|publisher=ASHG|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASHG supports Genetic Privacy Provisions in 21st Century Cures Act|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-12/asoh-asg120716.php|publisher=EurekAlert!|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congress passes 21st Century Cures Act with billions for new research, treatments|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/21st-century-cures-act-congress-health-care-passed/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congress acts to protect the most personal data – genetic information|url=http://www.pinebluffspost.com/story/2016/12/15/opinion/congress-acts-to-protect-the-most-personal-data-genetic-information/5208.html|publisher=Pine Bluffs Post|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
To balance data sharing with the need to protect the privacy of research subjects geneticists are considering to move more data behind controlled-access barriers, authorizing trusted users to access the data from many studies, rather than "having to obtain it piecemeal from different studies".&lt;ref name=nature1/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes1/&gt;

In October 2005, [[IBM]] became the world's first major corporation to establish a genetics privacy policy. Its policy prohibits using employees' genetic information in employment decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM100 - Pioneering Genetic Privacy|url=https://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/geneticprivacy/|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breaching techniques==
According to a 2014 study genetic privacy breaching by [[Yaniv Erlich]] and [[Arvind Narayanan]] techniques fall into three categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|title=Routes for breaching and protecting genetic privacy|eprint=1310.3197|date=2013|author1=Yaniv Erlich |author2=Arvind Narayanan |class=q-bio.GN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Identity Tracing
:Here the aim is to link between an unknown genome and the concealed identity of the data originator by accumulating quasi-identifiers − residual pieces of information that are embedded in the dataset − and to gradually narrow down the possible individuals that match the combination of these quasi-identifiers.
* Attribute Disclosure Attacks via DNA (ADAD)
:Here the adversary already has access to the identified DNA sample of the target and to a database that links DNA-derived data to sensitive attributes without explicit identifiers, for example a public database of the genetic study of drug abuse. The ADAD techniques match the DNA data and associate the identity of the target with the sensitive attribute
* Completion Techniques
:Here the adversary also knows the identity of a genomic dataset but has access only to a sanitized version without sensitive [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]. The aim here is to expose the sensitive loci that are not part of the original data.

'''Internal security''', or '''IS''', is the act of keeping peace within the [[border]]s of a [[sovereign state]] or other [[Self-governance|self-governing territories]], generally by upholding the national [[law]] and defending against internal security threats. Responsibility for internal security may range from [[police]] to [[paramilitary]] forces, and in exceptional circumstances, the [[military]] itself.

==Threats to internal security==
Threats to the general peace may range from low-level [[civil disorder]], large scale [[violence]], or even an armed [[insurgency]]. Threats to internal security may be directed at either the state's [[citizen]]s, or the organs and infrastructure of [[State (polity)|the state]] itself, and may range from petty [[crime]], serious [[organised crime]], political or industrial unrest, or even domestic [[terrorism]]. Foreign powers may also act as a threat to internal security, by either committing or sponsoring terrorism or [[rebellion]], without actually [[Declaration of war|declaring war]].

==Forces and agencies==
Governmental responsibility for internal security will generally rest with an [[interior ministry]], as opposed to a [[Defence minister|defence ministry]]. Depending on the state, a state's internal security will be maintained by either the ordinary [[Law enforcement agency|police or law enforcement]] agencies or more militarised police forces (known as [[Gendarmerie]] or, literally, the [[Internal Troops]].). Other specialised internal security agencies may exist to augment these main forces, such as [[border guard]]s, [[List of special law enforcement units|special police unit]]s, or aspects of the state's [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]]. In some states, internal security may be the primary responsibility of a [[secret police]] force.

The level of authorised force used by agencies and forces responsible for maintaining internal security might range from unarmed [[police]] to fully armed [[paramilitary]] organisations, or employ some level of [[less-lethal weapon]]ry in between. For violent situations, internal security forces may contain some element of military type equipment such as [[non-military armored vehicles]].

==Justice aspects==
Depending on the organisation of the state, internal security forces may have [[jurisdiction]] on national or [[Federation|federal]] levels. As the concept of internal security refers to the entity of the state and its citizens, persons who are threats to internal security may be designated as an [[enemy of the state]] or [[enemy of the people]].

Persons detained by internal security forces may either be dealt with by the normal [[criminal justice]] system, or for more serious crimes against internal security such as [[treason]], they may face special measures such as [[secret trial]]s. In times of extreme unrest, internal security actions may include measures such as [[internment]] (detention without trial).

==Relationship with the military==
Depending on the nature of the specific state's [[form of government]], enforcing internal security will generally not be carried out by a country's [[military]] forces, whose primary role is external defence, except in times of extreme unrest or other [[state of emergency]], short of [[civil war]]. Often, military involvement in internal security is explicitly prohibited, or is restricted to authorised [[military aid to the civil power]] as part of the principle of [[civilian control of the military]]. Military [[List of special forces units|special forces units]] may in some cases be put under the temporary command of civilian powers, for special internal security situations such as [[counter terrorism]] operations.

The '''International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes''' ('''ICSID''') is an [[international arbitration]] institution established in 1966 for legal [[dispute resolution]] and [[conciliation]] between international investors. The ICSID is part of and funded by the [[World Bank Group]], headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the [[United States]]. It is an autonomous, multilateral specialized institution to encourage international flow of investment and mitigate non-commercial risks by a treaty drafted by the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]'s executive directors and signed by member countries.&lt;ref name="ICSID About 2012"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About ICSID | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;actionVal=ShowHome&amp;pageName=AboutICSID_Home | accessdate = 25 July 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120610184851/http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;actionVal=ShowHome&amp;pageName=AboutICSID_Home | archivedate = 10 June 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICSID Organizational Structure 2012"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Organizational Structure of ICSID | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;actionVal=RightFrame&amp;FromPage=Organization%20and%20Structure&amp;pageName=Organization | accessdate = 25 July 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120731040440/http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;actionVal=RightFrame&amp;FromPage=Organization%20and%20Structure&amp;pageName=Organization | archivedate = 31 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of |May 2016}}, 153 contracting member states agreed to enforce and uphold [[arbitral award]]s in accordance with the ICSID Convention.

The center performs advisory activities and maintains several publications.

==History==
In the 1950s and 1960s, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (now the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]) had made several attempts to create a framework to protect international investments, but its efforts revealed conflicting views on how to provide compensation for the [[expropriation]] of [[foreign direct investment]].

===Creation===
In 1961, then-General Counsel of the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD) [[Aron Broches]] developed the idea for a [[multilateral treaty|multilateral agreement]] on a process for resolving individual investment disputes on a case by case basis as opposed to imposing outcomes based on standards. Broches held conferences to consult legal experts from all parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia, to discuss and compose a preliminary agreement. The IBRD staff wrote an official draft of the agreement and consulted with legal representatives of the IBRD's board of directors to finalize the draft and have it approved.

The board of directors approved the final draft of the agreement, titled ''Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States'', and the Bank president disseminated the convention to its member states for signature on 18 March 1965. Twenty states immediately ratified the convention. The convention established the ICSID would become officially active on 14 October 1966.&lt;ref name="ICSID About 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed et al. 2010"&gt;{{cite book | title=Guide to ICSID Arbitration, 2nd Edition | publisher=Kluwer Law International | author=Reed, Lucy | author2=Paulsson, Jan | author3=Blackaby, Nigel | year=2010 | location=The Hague, Netherlands | pages=468 | isbn=978-9-04-113401-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref name="ICSID Convention 2006"&gt;{{cite report | url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/CRR_English-final.pdf | title=ICSID Convention, Regulations and Rules | publisher=World Bank Group | date=2006 | accessdate=25 July 2012 | author=International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | pages=128 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904160429/https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/CRR_English-final.pdf | archivedate=4 September 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

===Disputes settled===
The [[Indonesia]]n government was sued in June 2012 by a [[London]]-based mining company [[Churchill Mining]] after the local government revoked the concession rights held by a local company in which the firm had invested.&lt;ref name=SC /&gt; The government is countering the Churchill case, claiming that Churchill did not have the correct type of mining licenses.&lt;ref name=SC /&gt;

In October 2012, an ICSID tribunal awarded a judgment of $1.8 billion for [[Occidental Petroleum]] against the government of [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/globalization/globalization-of-the-economy-2-1/trade-agreements-2-4/52113-the-emerging-crisis-of-investment-treaties.html | title=The emerging crisis of investment treaties | work=Global Policy Forum | date=21 November 2012 | author=Martin Khor }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Ecuador had to pay $589 million in backdated [[compound interest]] and half of the costs of the tribunal, making its total penalty around $2.4 billion.&lt;ref name=SC /&gt; The South American country annulled a contract with the oil firm on the grounds that it violated a clause that the company would not sell its rights to another firm without permission. The tribunal agreed the violation took place but judged that the annulment was not fair and equitable treatment to the company.&lt;ref name=SC /&gt;

Irish oil firm [[Tullow Oil]] took the [[Uganda]]n government to court in November 2012 after [[value-added tax]] (VAT) was placed on goods and services the firm purchased for its operations in the country.&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Tullow-sues-government-in-new-tax-dispute/-/688334/1645452/-/10bijel/-/index.html | title=Tullow Sues Government in New Tax Dispute | work=Daily Monitor | date=17 December 2012 | accessdate=15 May 2016 | author=Tabu Butagira | location=Uganda}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ugandan government responded that the company had no right to claim tax on such goods prior to commencement of drilling.

Tobacco major [[Philip Morris v. Uruguay|Philip Morris sued Uruguay]] for alleged breaches to the Uruguay-Swiss BIT for requiring cigarette packs to display graphic health warnings and sued Australia under the Australia-Hong Kong BITS for requiring plain packaging for its cigarettes. The company claimed that the packaging requirements in both countries violate its investment.&lt;ref name=SC /&gt;

In the context of [[Nuclear power phase-out]] in Germany, Swedish Energy company [[Vattenfall]] sought compensation from the German government for the premature shut-down of nuclear plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://corporate.vattenfall.com/press-and-media/news/2014/why-vattenfall-is-taking-germany-to-court/ | title=Why Vattenfall is taking Germany to court | work=Vattenfall AB website | date=9 December 2014 | accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/vattenfall-klage-eu-unterstuetzt-deutschland-a-1054667.html | title=Klage gegen Atomausstieg: EU unterstützt Deutschland im Streit mit Vattenfall | work=Der Spiegel | date=2014 | accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance since creation===
[[Bilateral investment treaty|Bilateral investment treaties]] (BITs) proliferated during the first decade of the 21st century, reaching more than 2,500 by 2007. Many such treaties contain text that refers present and future investment disputes to the ICSID.&lt;ref name="Weisbrot 2007"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://risal.collectifs.net/article.php3?id_article=2298 | title=Le CIRDI en ligne de mire : la Bolivie, le Venezuela et le Nicaragua claquent la porte | publisher=RISAL | date=10 July 2007 | accessdate=27 July 2012 | author=Weisbrot, Mark | language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its launch to 30 June 2012, the ICSID has registered 390 dispute cases.&lt;ref name="ICSID Caseload Statistics 2012" /&gt;{{rp|7}}  The ICSID's caseload consisted of 88% convention arbitration cases, 2% convention conciliation cases, as well as 9% additional facility arbitration cases, and 1% additional facility conciliation cases.&lt;ref name="ICSID Caseload Statistics 2012" /&gt;{{rp|8}} The ICSID's registered cases were distributed across [[fossil fuel|oil, gas]] and [[mining]] (25%), [[Electric energy|electricity]] and other energy (13%), other industries (12%), [[transportation industry]] (11%), [[construction industry]] (7%), [[financial industry]] (7%), [[information industry]] and communication industry (6%), [[water industry]], sanitation, and food protection (6%), [[Primary sector of the economy|agriculture, fishing, and forestry]] (5%), [[Tertiary sector of the economy|services and trade]] (4%), and [[tourism industry]] (4%).&lt;ref name="ICSID Caseload Statistics 2012"&gt;{{Cite report | title = The ICSID Caseload – Statistics (Issue 2012-2) | publisher = World Bank Group | date = 2012 | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/resources/Documents/2012-2%20%20-%20English.pdf | accessdate = 25 July 2012}}{{broken link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}

{{As of|2012|7|27}}, 246 of 390 registered arbitration cases were concluded, {{As of|2012|6|30|lc=y}}, the ICSID's tribunal had resolved nearly two thirds (62%) of disputes while the remainder (38%) were settled or discontinued.&lt;ref name="ICSID Caseload Statistics 2012" /&gt;{{rp|13}} 
{{As of|2016|5|14}}, 362 of 574 (62%) registered arbitration cases were concluded .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/cases/Pages/AdvancedSearch.aspx | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231040923/https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/cases/Pages/AdvancedSearch.aspx | dead-url=yes | archive-date=31 December 2014 | title=Cases | publisher=International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | date=14 May 2016 | accessdate=14 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Conciliation commission reports were issued for 67% of the conciliation proceedings, while 33% of proceedings were discontinued. In 75% of the conciliation reports, parties failed to reach agreement, and only 25% recorded agreement among parties.&lt;ref name="ICSID List of Concluded Cases 2012"&gt;{{Cite web | title = List of Concluded Cases | publisher = World Bank Group | author = | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=GenCaseDtlsRH&amp;actionVal=ListConcluded | accessdate = 26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2012}} only two governments, Gabon and Romania, had ever filed an ICSID case against an investor.  States appearing most often as a respondent were in descending order: Argentina 49, Venezuela 36, Egypt 17, Ecuador 12, Congo 12, Peru 11 and Ukraine 10 times. Between 2009 and 2012, legal representation cost between US$ 1 and 7.6 million. The approximate duration of a case was 3.6 years.&lt;ref name=kluwer&gt;{{cite web|author1=Inna Uchkunova|title=ICSID: Curious Facts|url=http://kluwerarbitrationblog.com/blog/2012/10/25/icsid-curious-facts/|publisher=Kluwer Arbitration Blog|accessdate=3 January 2015|date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The ICSID is governed by its Administrative Council which meets annually and elects the center's secretary-general and deputy secretary-general, approves rules and regulations, conducts the center's case proceedings, and approves the center's budget and annual report. The council consists of one representative from each of the center's contracting member states and is chaired by the [[World Bank Group#Presidency|President of the World Bank Group]], although the president may not vote. The ICSID's normal operations are carried out by its secretariat, which comprises 40 employees and is led by the secretary-general of the ICSID. The secretariat provides support to the Administrative Council in conducting the center's proceedings. It also manages the center's Panel of Conciliators and Panel of Arbitrators. Each contracting member state may appoint four persons to each panel.&lt;ref name="ICSID Convention 2006" /&gt;{{rp|15}} In addition to serving as the center's principal, the secretary-general is responsible for legally representing the ICSID and serving as the registrar of its proceedings. {{As of|2012}}, Meg Kinnear serves as the center's secretary-general.&lt;ref name="ICSID Organizational Structure 2012" /&gt;

==Membership==

ICSID's 161 member states which have signed the center's convention include 160 [[United Nations member states]] plus [[Republic of Kosovo|Kosovo]]. Of these member states, only 153 are "contracting member states", that is they have ratified the contract.&lt;ref name="ICSID Member States" /&gt; Former members are [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]] (withdrew 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter= On the Internationalization of Administrative Contracts, Arbitration and the Calvo Doctrine | last= Tawil | first= Guido Santiago | pages= 345–346 | title= Arbitration Advocay in Changing Times | volume= 15 | year= 2011 | editor-first= Albert | editor-last= Jan Berg | publisher= Kluwer Law International | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QeyYCCG10yAC&amp;pg=PA346 | quote= Ecuador notified its withdrawal from the ICSID Convention on 6 July 2009.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Venezuela]], which withdrew in 2012.&lt;ref name="Eljuri 2012"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Venezuela denounces the ICSID Convention | publisher = Norton Rose | author = Eljuri, Elisabeth | url = http://www.nortonrose.com/knowledge/publications/62427/venezuela-denounces-the-icsid-convention | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120606073513/http://www.nortonrose.com/knowledge/publications/62427/venezuela-denounces-the-icsid-convention | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-06-06 | date = January 2012 | accessdate = 19 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
All ICSID contracting member states, whether or not they are parties to a given dispute, are required by the ICSID Convention to recognize and enforce ICSID arbitral awards.&lt;ref name="ICSID Convention 2006" /&gt;

===Non-contracting signatories===
The following member states have signed the ICSID convention (date in parentheses), but have not ratified it.&lt;ref name="ICSID Member States" /&gt;
*{{flagu|Belize}} (1986)
*{{flagu|Dominican Republic}} (2000)

===Non members===
[[Brazil]], [[India]], [[Mexico]] and [[South Africa]] are countries with large economies that have never been ICSID members, until January 2018 when Mexico joined the ICSID.

==Activities==
The ICSID does not conduct arbitration or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers institutional and procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has two sets of rules that determine how cases will be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. To be processed in accordance with the ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's contracting member states and a national of another contracting member state. It must also be of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of the parties to the dispute is either not a contracting member state or a national of a contracting member state. However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention.&lt;ref name="ICSID Annual Report 2011"&gt;{{Cite report | title = ICSID 2011 Annual Report | publisher = World Bank Group | date = 2011 | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=ICSIDPublicationsRH&amp;actionVal=ViewAnnualReports&amp;year=2011_Eng | accessdate = 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICSID Annual Report 2010"&gt;{{Cite report | title = ICSID 2010 Annual Report | publisher = World Bank Group | date = 2010 | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=ICSIDPublicationsRH&amp;actionVal=ViewAnnualReports&amp;year=2010_Eng | accessdate = 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = How "Water for All!" policy became hegemonic: The power of the World Bank and its transnational policy networks | journal = Geoforum | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | year = 2007 | pages = 786–800 | author = Goldman, Michael | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718506001382 | accessdate = 2 August 2012 | doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2005.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary. However, once the parties have consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither party can unilaterally withdraw its consent.&lt;ref name="ICSID Dispute Settlement Facilities 2012"&gt;{{Cite web | title = ICSID Dispute Settlement Facilities | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;actionVal=RightFrame&amp;FromPage=Dispute%20Settlement%20Facilities&amp;pageName=Disp_settl_facilities | accessdate = 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICSID Secretariat may also administer dispute resolution proceedings under other treaties and regularly assists tribunals or disputing parties in arbitrations among investors and states under the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] (UNCITRAL)'s arbitration regulations. The center provides administrative and technical support for a number of international dispute resolution proceedings through alternative facilities such as the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], the [[London Court of International Arbitration]], and the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] in [[Paris]], France.&lt;ref name="ICSID Annual Report 2011" /&gt;

The ICSID also conducts advisory activities and research and publishes ''Investment Laws of the World and of Investment Treaties''.&lt;ref name="ICSID Publications 2012"&gt;{{Cite web | title = ICSID Publications | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=ICSIDPublicationsRH&amp;actionVal=ViewPublications&amp;reqFrom=Main | accessdate = 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since April 1986, the center has published a semi-annual law journal entitled ''[[ICSID Review|ICSID Review: Foreign Investment Law Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="ICSID Review Journal 2012"&gt;{{Cite web | title = ICSID Review-Foreign Investment Law Journal | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=ICSIDBibliographyRH&amp;actionVal=IcsidReview | accessdate = 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ICSID's proceedings generally take place in Washington, D.C., parties may agree that proceedings be held at one of a number of possible alternative locations, including the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Regional Arbitration Centres of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee in [[Cairo]], in [[Kuala Lumpur]], or in [[Lagos]], the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration in [[Melbourne]], the Australian Commercial Disputes Centre in Sydney, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, the Gulf Cooperation Council Commercial Arbitration Centre in Bahrain, the German Institution of Arbitration, the [[Maxwell Chambers]] in Singapore, the [[Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre]], and the Centre for Arbitration and Conciliation at the Chamber of Commerce of Bogota.&lt;ref name="ICSID Institutional Arrangements 2012"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Institutional Arrangements | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;actionVal=RightFrame&amp;FromPage=Co-operation%20agreements&amp;pageName=Coop_with_Oth_Inst | accessdate = 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Journal of Law and Religion''''' is a peer-reviewed, interdisciplinary journal published through [[Cambridge University Press]] and edited by the [[Center for the Study of Law and Religion]] at [[Emory University School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-and-religion|title=Journal of Law and Religion|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary interests include topics related to the relationship between religion and law, including subjects related to theological [[jurisprudence]] and [[political theology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The journal was founded at [[Hamline University School of Law]] by the Harvard Law professor [[Harold J. Berman]] in 1982 along with Stephen B.Young, then Dean of the law school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamline.edu/HUNewsDetail.aspx?id=2110|title=Journal of Law &amp; Religion Salutes 25 Years of "Building Community and Deepening Understanding"|last=|first=|date=|website=Hamline University Law School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council on Religion and Law and Harvard Divinity School Professor [[James Luther Adams]] were also instrumental in starting the Journal. The goal of the Journal was to provide multiple frameworks of analysis for the study and discussion of structures of positive law. The Journal moved to the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at [[Emory University School of Law|Emory]] in 2013, two years prior to Hamline's merger with [[William Mitchell College of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationaljurist.com/national-jurist-magazine/journal-law-and-religion-moves-hamline-emory|title=Journal of Law and Religion moves from Hamline to Emory|last=|first=|date=8 August 2013|website=The National Jurist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jus tertii''''' ([[Latin]], “''third party rights''”) is the legal classification for an argument made by a third party (as opposed  to the legal [[title]] holder) which attempts to justify entitlement to [[Possession (law)|possessory]] rights based on the showing of legal title in another person. By showing legitimate title in another person, ''jus tertii'' arguments imply that the present possessor’s interest is illegitimate or that the present possessor is a [[thief]].

Under [[United States law]], ''jus tertii'' arguments are generally insufficient to support actions for [[replevin]] because they fail to show that possession is ''more'' legitimate in the third party than in the present possessor.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Gissel v. State'', [[Case citation|727 P.2d 1153]] (Idaho 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Bailment|bailee]] or other legal [[Agent (law)|agent]] of the owner may successfully assert the argument.

The principle is sometimes used to allow one person to enforce or test the constitutional rights of another, which usually can't be done due to lack of standing.  This is only possible for fundamental rights, where there is a close connection between the person whose rights are violated and the person wishing to enforce them, and the constitutional right being enforced is a fundamental right.  See, e.g., ''Singleton v. Wulff'' Et Al., 96 S. Ct. 2868, 428 U.S. 106 (U.S. 1976).

==Hypothetical example==
Art brings an [[cause of action|action]] for replevin against Burt, seeking to recover a [[bicycle]]. In support for the action, Art presents evidence that Cathy is in fact the true owner of the bicycle in question, not Burt. A US court would reject Art’s ''jus tertii'' argument for replevin because he has failed to show that he has a more legitimate interest in the bike than Burt.

==Case law example==
In ''Gissel v. State'', [[Case citation|727 P.2d 1153]] (Idaho 1986), Gissel unlawfully harvested wild rice growing on land jointly owned by the state of Idaho and the [[National Forest Service]]. An Idaho Court convicted Gissel of [[trespass]], and Idaho officials seized and sold the rice at [[Sheriff's sale|auction]]. Because Idaho had only one half interest in the land, Gissel challenged the state’s authority to seize, sell, and keep the profits from all of the rice. The [[Idaho Supreme Court]] held that Gissel was entitled to half of the profits because Idaho did not effectively make the ''jus tertii'' argument on behalf of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], “the Gissels, though trespassers and without legal title, which title rests with the Forest Service, still by mere possession have greater rights superior to that of the state.”

The ''jus tertii'' principle also extends to criminal law. For example, in ''Anic, Stylianou &amp; Suleyman v R'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|SASC|4159|1993|litigants=Anic, Stylianou and Suleyman v R |parallelcite= (1993) 61 [[South Australian State Reports|SASR]] 223 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; three men were charged with larceny (among other things) after breaking into a house to steal drugs. The men argued that they should not be charged with stealing something which is unlawfully possessed. The court rejected this argument on the basis that larceny has always been an offence against possession. The common law has never recognised an absolute right of ownership. The owner is merely the person who has the best right to possession. Therefore, a person can be guilty of larceny by stealing from someone who had stolen the thing from someone else. The right to possess drugs is limited by statute but the occupant of the house had a better right to possession than the defendants.

The '''Kyoto Protocol''' is an international [[treaty]] which extends the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) that commits state parties to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, based on the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] that (part one) [[global warming]] is occurring and (part two) it is extremely likely that human-made [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions]] have predominantly caused it. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]] on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005. There are currently 192 parties ([[Canada]] withdrew from the protocol, effective December 2012)&lt;ref name=UNlist/&gt; to the Protocol.

The Kyoto Protocol implemented the objective of the UNFCCC to reduce the onset of global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to "a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system" (Article 2). The Kyoto Protocol applies to the six greenhouse gases listed in Annex A: Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous oxide (N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). &lt;ref&gt;Report Of The Conference Of The Parties On Its Third Session, Held At Kyoto From 1 To 11 December 1997 https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/cop3/07a01.pdf#page=28&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: it acknowledges that individual countries have different capabilities in combating climate change, owing to [[economic development]], and ergo puts the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed countries on the basis that they are historically responsible for the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

The Protocol's first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012. A second commitment period was agreed on in 2012, known as the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, in which 37 countries have binding targets: [[Australia]], the [[European Union]] (and its 28 [[Member states of the European Union|member states]]), [[Belarus]], [[Iceland]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Ukraine]]. Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine have stated that they may withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol or not put into legal force the Amendment with second round targets.&lt;ref name="figueres doha summary"&gt;{{citation | last=Figueres | first= C. | title=Environmental issues: Time to abandon blame-games and become proactive - Economic Times | work=The Economic Times / Indiatimes.com| publisher=Times Internet | url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-12-15/news/35836633_1_emission-reduction-targets-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change | date=15 December 2012 | accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan, [[New Zealand]] and [[Russia]] have participated in Kyoto's first-round but have not taken on new targets in the second commitment period. Other developed countries without second-round targets are Canada (which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2012) and the [[United States]] (which has not ratified). As of November 2018, 122&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/doha_amendment/items/7362.php|website=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|accessdate=23 July 2016|ref=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; states have accepted the Doha Amendment, while entry into force requires the acceptances of 144 states. Of the 37 countries with binding commitments, 7 have ratified.

Negotiations were held in the framework of the yearly UNFCCC Climate Change Conferences on measures to be taken after the second commitment period ends in 2020. This resulted in the 2015 adoption of the [[Paris Agreement]], which is a separate instrument under the UNFCCC rather than an amendment of the Kyoto Protocol.

The European Union as a whole has in accordance with this treaty committed itself to a 6.7% reduction. However, many member states (such as Greece, Spain, Ireland and Sweden) have not committed themselves to any reduction while France has committed itself not to expand its emissions (0% reduction).&lt;ref&gt;KOM(2007) final edition page 2{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The view that human activities are likely responsible for most of the observed increase in global mean temperature ("global warming") since the mid-20th century is an accurate reflection of current scientific thinking.&lt;ref&gt;

{{See also|History of climate change science}}

'''1992''' The UN Conference on the Environment and Development is held in Rio de Janeiro. It results in the Framework Convention on Climate Change [http://www.unfccc.int/ ("FCCC" or "UNFCCC")] among other agreements.

'''1995''' Parties to the UNFCCC meet in Berlin (the 1st Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC) to outline specific targets on emissions.

'''1997''' In December the parties conclude the Kyoto Protocol in Kyoto, Japan, in which they agree to the broad outlines of emissions targets.

'''2004''' Russia and Canada ratify the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC bringing the treaty into effect on 16 February 2005.

'''2011''' Canada became the first signatory to announce its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ec.gc.ca/Publications/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=EE4F06AE-1&amp;xml=EE4F06AE-13EF-453B-B633-FCB3BAECEB4F&amp;offset=3&amp;toc=show Canadian government official archives&lt;/ref&gt;

* Implementation. In order to meet the objectives of the Protocol, Annex I Parties are required to prepare policies and measures for the reduction of greenhouse gases in their respective countries. In addition, they are required to increase the absorption of these gases and utilize all mechanisms available, such as joint implementation, the clean development mechanism and emissions trading, in order to be rewarded with credits that would allow more greenhouse gas emissions at home.
* Minimizing Impacts on Developing Countries by establishing an [[Climate change adaptation|adaptation]] fund for climate change.

==First commitment period: 2008–2012==
Under the Kyoto Protocol, 37 [[industrialized countries]] and the [[European Community]] (the [[European Union]]-15, made up of 15 states at the time of the Kyoto negotiations) commit themselves to binding targets for GHG emissions.&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc kyoto protocol overview"/&gt;  The targets apply to the four greenhouse gases [[carbon dioxide]] ({{Chem|CO|2|}}), [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}), [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}}), [[sulphur hexafluoride]] ({{chem|S|F|6}}), and two groups of gases, [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s (HFCs) and [[perfluorocarbon]]s (PFCs).&lt;ref name="grubb kyoto gases"&gt;
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=147}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The six GHG are translated into [[Co2e|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents]] in determining reductions in emissions.&lt;ref&gt;
The benchmark 1990 emission levels accepted by the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Conference of the parties]] of UNFCCC (decision 2/CP.3) were the values of "[[global warming potential]]" calculated for the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]]. These figures are used for converting the various greenhouse gas emissions into comparable [[Co2e|carbon dioxide equivalents]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq) when computing overall sources and sinks.

&lt;/ref&gt; However, five state parties have an alternative base year:&lt;ref name="2008 unfccc kyoto protocol reference manual"/&gt;

* Hungary: the average of the years 1985–1987;
* Poland: 1988;
* Romania: 1989;
* Slovenia: 1986.

Annex I Parties can use a range of sophisticated "flexibility" mechanisms (see below) to meet their targets. Annex I Parties can achieve their targets by allocating reduced annual allowances to major operators within their borders, or by allowing these operators to exceed their allocations by offsetting any excess through a mechanism that is agreed by all the parties to the UNFCCC, such as by buying [[emissions trading|emission allowances]] from other operators which have excess emissions credits.

==Flexibility mechanisms==

The Protocol defines three "[[flexibility mechanisms]]" that can be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their emission limitation commitments.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; "Marginal cost" is the cost of abating the last tonne of {{chem|CO|2}}-eq for an Annex I/non-Annex I Party. At the time of the original Kyoto targets, studies suggested that  the flexibility mechanisms could reduce the overall ([[aggregate data|aggregate]]) cost of meeting the targets.&lt;ref name="hourcade 2001 economic costs of flexibility mechanisms"&gt;

The CDM and JI are called "project-based mechanisms," in that they generate emission reductions from projects. The difference between IET and the project-based mechanisms is that IET is based on the setting of a quantitative restriction of emissions, while the CDM and JI are based on the idea of "production" of emission reductions.&lt;ref name="toth 2001 flexibility mechanisms"/&gt;  The CDM is designed to encourage production of emission reductions in non-Annex I Parties, while JI encourages production of emission reductions in Annex I Parties.

The production of emission reductions generated by the CDM and JI can be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their emission limitation commitments.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The emission reductions produced by the CDM and JI are both measured against a hypothetical [[Economics of climate change mitigation#Baselines|baseline]] of emissions that would have occurred in the absence of a particular emission reduction project. The emission reductions produced by the CDM are called [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CERs); reductions produced by JI are called [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs). The reductions are called "[[carbon credit|credits]]" because they are emission reductions credited against a hypothetical baseline of emissions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Each Annex I country is required to submit an annual report of inventories of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from sources and removals from sinks under UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. These countries nominate a person (called a "designated national authority") to create and manage its [[greenhouse gas inventory]]. Virtually all of the non-Annex I countries have also established a designated national authority to manage their Kyoto obligations, specifically the "CDM process". This determines which GHG projects they wish to propose for accreditation by the CDM Executive Board.

OECD countries with a deficit could meet their Kyoto commitments by buying allowances from transition countries with a surplus. Unless other commitments were made to reduce the total surplus in allowances, such trade would not actually result in emissions being reduced&lt;ref name="2009 carbon trust carbon market"/&gt;{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}} (see also the section below on the [[Kyoto Protocol#Green Investment Scheme|Green Investment Scheme]]).

====Green Investment Scheme====

A Green Investment Scheme (GIS) refers to a plan for achieving environmental benefits from trading surplus allowances (AAUs) under the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref name="Definition of Green Investment Scheme (GIS)"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Investment Scheme (GIS), a mechanism in the framework of International Emissions Trading (IET), is designed to achieve greater flexibility in reaching the targets of the Kyoto Protocol while preserving environmental integrity of IET. However, using the GIS is not required under the Kyoto Protocol, and there is no official definition of the term.&lt;ref name="Definition of Green Investment Scheme (GIS)"/&gt;

Under the GIS a Party to the Protocol expecting that the development of its economy will not exhaust its Kyoto quota, can sell the excess of its Kyoto quota units (AAUs) to another Party. The proceeds from the AAU sales should be "greened", i.e. channeled to the development and implementation of the projects either acquiring the greenhouse gases emission reductions (hard greening) or building up the necessary framework for this process (soft greening).&lt;ref name="2009 carbon trust carbon market"/&gt;{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}}

====Clean Development Mechanism====

Between 2001, which was the first year [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) projects could be registered, and 2012, the end of the first Kyoto commitment period, the CDM is expected to produce some 1.5&amp;nbsp;billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e) in emission reductions.&lt;ref name=wdr&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these reductions are through [[renewable energy commercialisation]], [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and fuel switching (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;262). By 2012, the largest potential for production of CERs are estimated in [[China]] (52% of total CERs) and India (16%). CERs produced in Latin America and the Caribbean make up 15% of the potential total, with Brazil as the largest producer in the region (7%).

====Joint Implementation====

The formal crediting period for [[Joint Implementation]] (JI) was aligned with the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, and did not start until January 2008 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;20).&lt;ref name="2009 carbon trust carbon market"&gt;{{cite web

The total projected emission savings from JI by 2012 are about one tenth that of the CDM. Russia accounts for about two-thirds of these savings, with the remainder divided up roughly equally between the Ukraine and the EU's New Member States. Emission savings include cuts in methane, HFC, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emissions.

==Stabilization of GHG concentrations==

As noted [[Kyoto Protocol#Objectives|earlier on]], the first-round Kyoto emissions limitation commitments are not sufficient to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of GHGs. Stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations will require further emissions reductions after the end of the first-round Kyoto commitment period in 2012.&lt;ref name="grubb commitments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ipcc kyoto stabilization"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that Annex I emissions would need to be 25% to 40% below 1990 levels by 2020, and 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. The only Annex I Parties to have made voluntary pledges in line with this are Japan (25% below 1990 levels by 2020) and Norway (30-40% below 1990 levels by 2020).&lt;ref&gt;

Gupta ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;ref name="450ppm scenarios"/&gt; also looked at what 450&amp;nbsp;ppm scenarios projected for non-Annex I Parties. Projections indicated that by 2020, non-Annex I emissions in several regions ([[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]], [[East Asia]], and [[planned economy|centrally planned]] [[Asia]]) would need to be substantially reduced below [[Economics of climate change mitigation#Baselines|"business-as-usual"]].&lt;ref name="450ppm scenarios"/&gt; "Business-as-usual" are projected non-Annex I emissions in the absence of any new policies to control emissions. Projections indicated that by 2050, emissions in all non-Annex I regions would need to be substantially reduced below "business-as-usual".&lt;ref name="450ppm scenarios"/&gt;

==Details of the agreement==

The agreement is a protocol to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) adopted at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992, which did not set any legally binding limitations on emissions or enforcement mechanisms. Only Parties to the UNFCCC can become Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted at the third session of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 3) in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan.

National emission targets specified in the Kyoto Protocol exclude international aviation and shipping. Kyoto Parties can use [[land use]], land use change, and [[forestry]] (LULUCF) in meeting their targets.&lt;ref name="Dessai 2001 3"&gt;{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LULUCF activities are also called "sink" activities. Changes in sinks and land use can have an effect on the climate,&lt;ref&gt;

}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report on [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry]] estimates that since 1750 a third of global warming has been caused by land use change.&lt;ref&gt;Robert T. Watson, Ian R. Noble, Bert Bolin, N. H. Ravindranath, David J. Verardo and David J. Dokken (editors), 2000, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry, Cambridge University Press, UK&lt;/ref&gt; Particular criteria apply to the definition of forestry under the Kyoto Protocol.

[[Forest management]], [[farm|cropland]] management, [[grazing]] land management, and [[revegetation]] are all eligible LULUCF activities under the Protocol.&lt;ref name="forest management"&gt;
{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|p=9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Annex I Parties use of forest management in meeting their targets is capped.&lt;ref name="forest management"/&gt;

===Negotiations===

{{See also|Views on the Kyoto Protocol#Commentaries on negotiations}}

Article 4.2 of the UNFCCC commits industrialized countries to "[take] the lead" in reducing emissions.&lt;ref name="grubb original unfccc target"&gt;
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=144}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The initial aim was for industrialized countries to stabilize their emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.&lt;ref name="grubb original unfccc target"/&gt; The failure of key industrialized countries to move in this direction was a principal reason why Kyoto moved to binding commitments.&lt;ref name="grubb original unfccc target"/&gt;

At the first UNFCCC Conference of the Parties in Berlin, the [[Group of 77|G77]] was able to push for a mandate (the "Berlin mandate") where it was recognized that:&lt;ref name="liverman berlin mandate"&gt;
{{harvnb|Liverman|2009|p=290}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* developed nations had contributed most to the then-current concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere (see [[Greenhouse gas#Cumulative and historical emissions]]).
* developing country [[Greenhouse gas#Regional and national attribution of emissions|emissions per-capita]] (i.e., average emissions per head of population)&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation
 | title=Table A1: Energy-related emissions: Indicator: per capita (metric tons)
 | chapter=Part II: Selected Development Indicators
 | chapter-url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDRS/Resources/477365-1327504426766/8389626-1327510418796/Statistical-Annex.pdf
}}, in {{harvnb|World Bank|2010|p=370}}
&lt;/ref&gt; were still relatively low.
* and that the share of global emissions from developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.
During negotiations, the G-77 represented 133 developing countries. China was not a member of the group but an associate.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|p=4}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become a member.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|G-77|2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlin mandate was recognized in the Kyoto Protocol in that developing countries were not subject to emission reduction commitments in the first Kyoto commitment period.&lt;ref name="liverman berlin mandate"/&gt; However, the large potential for growth in developing country emissions made negotiations on this issue tense.&lt;ref name="grubb developing country emissions"&gt;
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|pp=145–146}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the final agreement, the Clean Development Mechanism was designed to limit emissions in developing countries, but in such a way that developing countries do not bear the costs for limiting emissions.&lt;ref name="grubb developing country emissions"/&gt; The general assumption was that developing countries would face quantitative commitments in later commitment periods, and at the same time, developed countries would meet their first round commitments.&lt;ref name="grubb developing country emissions"/&gt;

====Emissions cuts====

[[Views on the Kyoto Protocol#Commentaries on negotiations]] contains a list of the emissions cuts that were proposed by UNFCCC Parties during negotiations. The G77 and China were in favour of strong uniform emission cuts across the developed world.&lt;ref name="liverman negotiations"&gt;
{{harvnb|Liverman|2009|p=291}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The US originally proposed for the second round of negotiations on Kyoto commitments to follow the negotiations of the first.&lt;ref name="grubb second round negotiations"&gt;
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=148}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, negotiations on the second period were set to open no later than 2005.&lt;ref name="grubb second round negotiations"/&gt; Countries over-achieving in their first period commitments can "bank" their unused allowances for use in the subsequent period.&lt;ref name="grubb second round negotiations"/&gt;

The EU initially argued for only three GHGs to be included – {{chem|CO|2}}, {{chem|CH|4}}, and {{chem|N|2|O}} – with other gases such as HFCs regulated separately.&lt;ref name="liverman negotiations"/&gt; The EU also wanted to have a "bubble" commitment, whereby it could make a collective commitment that allowed some EU members to increase their emissions, while others cut theirs.&lt;ref name="liverman negotiations"/&gt;

The most vulnerable nations – the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS) – pushed for deep uniform cuts by developed nations, with the goal of having emissions reduced to the greatest possible extent.&lt;ref name="liverman negotiations"/&gt; Countries that had supported differentiation of targets had different ideas as to how it should be calculated, and many different indicators were proposed.&lt;ref name="grubb differentiation"/&gt; Two examples include differentiation of targets based on [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and differentiation based on [[energy intensity]] (energy use per unit of economic output).&lt;ref name="grubb differentiation"&gt;
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=151}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The final targets negotiated in the Protocol are the result of last minute political compromises.&lt;ref name="liverman negotiations"/&gt; The targets closely match those decided by Argentinian Raul Estrada, the [[diplomat]] who chaired the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Depledge|2000|p=46}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The numbers given to each Party by Chairman Estrada were based on targets already pledged by Parties, information received on latest negotiating positions, and the goal of achieving the strongest possible environmental outcome.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Depledge|2000|p=44}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The final targets are weaker than those proposed by some Parties, e.g., the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] and the G-77 and China, but stronger than the targets proposed by others, e.g., Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Depledge|2000|p=45}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial commitments===

The Protocol also reaffirms the principle that developed countries have to pay billions of dollars, and supply technology to other countries for climate-related studies and projects. The principle was originally agreed in [[UNFCCC]]. One such project is [[The Adaptation Fund]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adaptation-fund.org/|title=AF - Adaptation Fund|website=www.adaptation-fund.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;", that has been established by the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.

===Implementational provisions===
The protocol left several issues open to be decided later by the sixth Conference of Parties [[United Nations Climate Change conference#2000: COP 6, The Hague, Netherlands|COP6]] of the UNFCCC, which attempted to resolve these issues at its meeting in [[the Hague]] in late 2000, but it was unable to reach an agreement due to disputes between the European Union (who favoured a tougher implementation) and the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia (who wanted the agreement to be less demanding and more flexible).

In 2001, a continuation of the previous meeting (COP6bis) was held in [[Bonn]] where the required decisions were adopted. After some concessions, the supporters of the protocol (led by the [[European Union]]) managed to get the agreement of Japan and [[Russia]] by allowing more use of [[CO2 sink|carbon dioxide sinks]].

[[United Nations Climate Change conference#2001: COP 7, Marrakech, Morocco|COP7]] was held from 29 October 2001 through 9 November 2001 in [[Marrakech]] to establish the final details of the protocol.

The first Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP1) was held in [[Montreal]] from 28 November to 9 December 2005, along with the 11th conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP11). See [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]].

During COP13 in Bali, 36 developed [[Contact Group]] countries (plus the EU as a party in the [[European Union]]) agreed to a 10% emissions increase for [[Iceland]]; but, since the EU's member states each have individual obligations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Kyoto protocol – A brief summary | work=European Commission | url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/kyoto.htm | accessdate=19 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; much larger increases (up to 27%) are allowed for some of the less developed EU countries (see below [[Kyoto Protocol#Increase in greenhouse gas emission since 1990]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/background/items/3145.php |title=Kyoto Protocol |publisher=UNFCCC |date=14 May 2008 |accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduction limitations expired in 2013.

===Mechanism of compliance===

The protocol defines a mechanism of "compliance" as a "monitoring compliance with the commitments and penalties for non-compliance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Compliance with the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change
|first= S |last=Maljean-Dubois,

|publisher=Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations
|url=http://www.iddri.org/Publications/Collections/Syntheses/Compliance-with-the-Kyoto-Protocol-on-Climate-Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Grubb (2003),&lt;ref name="grubb compliance"&gt;
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=157}}
&lt;/ref&gt; the explicit consequences of non-compliance of the treaty are weak compared to domestic law.&lt;ref name="grubb compliance"/&gt; Yet, the compliance section of the treaty was highly contested in the Marrakesh Accords.&lt;ref name="grubb compliance"/&gt;

===Enforcement===

If the enforcement branch determines that an Annex I country is not in compliance with its emissions limitation, then that country is required to make up the difference during the second commitment period plus an additional 30%.  In addition, that country will be suspended from making transfers under an emissions trading program.&lt;ref&gt;

==Ratification process==

The Protocol was adopted by [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|COP 3]] of UNFCCC on 11 December 1997 in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. It was opened on 16 March 1998 for signature during one year by parties to [[UNFCCC]], when it was signed Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, the Maldives, Samoa, St. Lucia and Switzerland. At the end of the signature period, 82 countries and the [[European Community]] had signed. [[Ratification]] (which is required to become a party to the Protocol) started on 17 September with ratification of Fiji. Countries that did not sign acceded to the convention, which has the same legal effect.&lt;ref name=parties/&gt;

Article 25 of the Protocol specifies that the Protocol enters into force "on the ninetieth day after the date on which not less than 55 Parties to the Convention, incorporating Parties included in [[Annex I]] which accounted in total for at least 55% of the total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990 of the [[Annex I]] countries, have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kyoto Protocol full text (PDF)|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.pdf|publisher=UNFCC Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU and its Member States ratified the Protocol in May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/02/794&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=European Union ratifies the Kyoto Protocol |publisher=European Union|date=31 May 2002 |accessdate=13 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the two conditions, the "55 parties" clause was reached on 23 May 2002 when [[Iceland]] ratified the Protocol.&lt;ref name=parties&gt;{{cite web|title=Status of ratification|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/items/2613.php|publisher=UNFCC Homepage|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratification by [[Russia]] on 18 November 2004 satisfied the "55%" clause and brought the treaty into force, effective 16 February 2005, after the required lapse of 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=West|first=Larry|title=What is the Kyoto Protocol|url=http://environment.about.com/od/kyotoprotocol/i/kyotoprotocol.htm|publisher=About.com (Part of NYT)|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2013, [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|191 countries]] and one regional economic organization (the [[European Economic Community|EC]]) have ratified the agreement, representing over 61.6% of the 1990 emissions from [[Annex I]] countries.&lt;ref name = "Kyoto-PDF-unfccc"&gt;{{cite web | title=Kyoto Protocol: Status of Ratification | url=http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/application/pdf/kp_ratification.pdf | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=6 May 2009 | publisher=[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the 191 ratifying states—Canada—has renounced the protocol.

===Non-ratification by the US===
The US signed the Protocol on 12 November 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Research Service Reports #98-349: Global Climate Change: Selected Legal Questions About the Kyoto Protocol|url=http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/ern/01jul/98-349.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] presidency. To become binding in the US, however, the treaty had to be ratified by the [[United States Senate|Senate]], which had already passed the 1997 non-binding [[Byrd-Hagel Resolution]], expressing disapproval of any international agreement that did not require developing countries to make emission reductions and "would seriously harm the economy of the United States".  The resolution passed 95–0.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd-Hagel Resolution ({{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcenter.org/KyotoSenate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626110143/http://www.nationalcenter.org/KyotoSenate.html |archivedate=26 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }})&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even though the [[Clinton administration]] signed the treaty,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/12/11/kyoto/ "Clinton Hails Global Warming Pact"]. All Politics (CNN). 11 December 1997. Retrieved 5 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; it was never submitted to the Senate for ratification.

When [[George W. Bush]] was elected US president in 2000, he was asked by [[US Senator]] [[Chuck Hagel]] what his administration's position was on climate change. Bush replied that he took climate change "very seriously",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/George_W__Bush_Energy_+_Oil.htm#56|title=George W. Bush on Energy &amp; Oil|website=www.ontheissues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that he opposed the Kyoto treaty because "it exempts 80% of the world, including major population centers such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy."&lt;ref name="Dessai 2001 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tyndall Centre]] for Climate Change Research reported in 2001:&lt;blockquote&gt;This policy reversal received a massive wave of criticism that was quickly picked up by the international media. Environmental groups blasted the White House, while Europeans and Japanese alike expressed deep concern and regret. [...] Almost all world leaders (e.g. China, Japan, South Africa, Pacific Islands, etc.) expressed their disappointment at Bush's decision.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In response to this criticism, Bush stated: "I was responding to reality, and reality is the nation has got a real problem when it comes to energy." The Tyndall Centre called this "an overstatement used to cover up the big benefactors of this policy reversal, i.e., the US oil and coal industry, which has a powerful lobby with the administration and conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] congressmen."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, the US is the only signatory that has not ratified the Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-a&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |title=United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US accounted for 36% of emissions in 1990. As such, for the treaty to go into legal effect without US ratification, it would require a coalition including the EU, Russia, Japan, and small parties. A deal, without the US Administration, was reached in the Bonn climate talks (COP-6.5), held in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|pp=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other states and territories where the treaty is not applicable===
Andorra, [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[South Sudan]], the United States and, following their withdrawal on 15 December 2012, Canada are the only UNFCCC Parties that are not party to the Protocol. Furthermore, the Protocol is not applied to UNFCCC observer the [[Holy See]]. Although the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] approved the protocol for the whole Kingdom, it did not deposit an instrument of ratification for Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten or the [[Caribbean Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minbuza.nl/en/key-topics/treaties/search-the-treaty-database/1997/12/008415.html|work=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)]]|title=Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total aggregate GHG emissions excluding emissions/removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF, i.e., carbon storage in forests and soils) for all Annex I Parties (see list below) including the United States taken together decreased from 19.0 to 17.8 thousand [[Orders of magnitude (mass)|teragrams]] (Tg, which is equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg) {{chem|CO|2}} equivalent, a decline of 6.0% during the 1990-2008 period.&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"&gt;

Emissions growth in Annex I Parties have also been limited due to policies and measures (PaMs).&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/&gt;{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}} In particular, PaMs were strengthened after 2000, helping to enhance energy efficiency and develop renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/&gt;{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}} Energy use also decreased during the economic crisis in 2007-2008.&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/&gt;{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}}

====Projections====

UNFCCC (2011)&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/&gt;{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}} made projections of changes in emissions of the Annex I Parties and the effectiveness of their PaMs. It was noted that their projections should be interpreted with caution.&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/&gt;{{Rp|7|date=November 2012}}  For the 39 Annex I Parties, UNFCCC (2011) projected that existing PaMs would lead to annual emissions in 2010 of 17.5 thousand Tg {{chem|CO|2}} eq, excluding LULUCF, which is a decrease of 6.7% from the 1990 level.&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/&gt;{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}} Annual emissions in 2020 excluding LULUCF were projected to reach 18.9 thousand Tg {{chem|CO|2}} eq, which is an increase of 0.6% on the 1990 level.&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/&gt;{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}}

UNFCCC (2011)&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/&gt;{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}} made an estimate of the total effect of implemented and adopted PaMs. Projected savings were estimated relative to a [[Economics of climate change mitigation#Baselines|reference (baseline) scenario]] where PaMs are not implemented.  PaMs were projected to deliver emissions savings relative to baseline of about 1.5 thousand Tg {{chem|CO|2}} eq by 2010, and 2.8 thousand Tg {{chem|CO|2}} eq by 2020.&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/&gt;{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}}  In percentage terms, and using annual emissions in the year 1990 as a reference point, PaMs were projected to deliver at least a 5.0% reduction relative to baseline by 2010, and a 10.0% reduction relative to baseline in 2020.&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/&gt;{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}} Scenarios reviewed by UNFCCC (2011)&lt;ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/&gt;{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}} still suggested that total Annex I annual emissions would increase out to 2020 (see the preceding paragraph).

====Annex I Parties with targets====

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Percentage changes in emissions for Annex I Parties with Kyoto targets&lt;ref&gt;Emissions data given in this table may not fully reflect progress towards the first-round Kyoto targets. This is because of the implicit trading of targets under the EU ETS (see [[Kyoto Protocol#Intergovernmental Emissions Trading]]), possible effects of trade in AAUs (see [[Kyoto Protocol#Trade in AAUs]]), and the use of different emissions base years for some Parties (see [[Kyoto Protocol#2012 emission targets and "flexible mechanisms"]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Data given in the table above may not be fully reflective of a country's progress towards meeting its first-round Kyoto target. The summary below contains more up-to-date information on how close countries are to meeting their first-round targets.''

Collectively the group of industrialized countries committed to a Kyoto target, i.e., the Annex I countries excluding the US, have a target of reducing their GHG emissions by 4.2% on average for the period 2008-2012 relative to the base year, which in most cases is 1990.&lt;ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/&gt;{{Rp|24|date=November 2012}}  According to Olivier ''et al.'' (2011),&lt;ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/&gt;{{Rp|24|date=November 2012}} the Kyoto Parties will comfortably exceed their collective target, with a projected average reduction of 16% for 2008-2012. This projection excludes both LULUCF and credits generated by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).&lt;ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/&gt;{{Rp|24|date=November 2012}}

As noted in the preceding section, between 1990–1999, there was a large reduction in the emissions of the EITs.&lt;ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/&gt;{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}} The reduction in the EITs is largely responsible for the total (aggregate) reduction (excluding LULUCF) in emissions of the Annex I countries, excluding the US.&lt;ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/&gt;{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}} Emissions of the Annex II countries (Annex I minus the EIT countries) have experienced a limited increase in emissions from 1990–2006, followed by stabilization and a more marked decrease from 2007 onwards.&lt;ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/&gt;{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}} The emissions reductions in the early nineties by the 12 EIT countries who have since joined the EU, assist the present EU-27 in meeting its collective Kyoto target.&lt;ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/&gt;{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}}

Almost all European countries are on track to achieve their first-round Kyoto targets.&lt;ref name="eea 1st round kyoto"&gt;
{{harvnb|EEA|2012|p=7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Spain plans to meet its target by purchasing a large quantity of Kyoto units through the flexibility mechanisms.&lt;ref name="eea 1st round kyoto"/&gt; Australia,&lt;ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/&gt;{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}} Canada&lt;ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/&gt;{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}} (Canada withdrew from the Kyoto treaty in 2012),&lt;ref name="vaughan 2011 canada withdrawal"/&gt; and Italy&lt;ref name="eea 1st round kyoto"/&gt; are not on course to meet their first-round Kyoto targets. In order to meet their targets, these countries would need to purchase emissions credits from other Kyoto countries.&lt;ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/&gt;{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}} As noted in the section on [[Kyoto Protocol#Intergovernmental Emissions Trading|Intergovernmental Emissions Trading]], purchasing surplus credits from the EIT countries would not actually result in total emissions being reduced. An alternative would be the purchase of CDM credits or the use of the voluntary Green Investment Scheme.

In December 2011, Canada's environment minister, [[Peter Kent]], formally announced that [[Climate change in Canada|Canada]] would withdraw from the Kyoto accord a day after the end of the [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (see the section on the [[Kyoto Protocol#Withdrawal of Canada|withdrawal of Canada]]).&lt;ref name="vaughan 2011 canada withdrawal"&gt;

'''Emissions'''

GHG emissions, excluding land use change and forestry (LUCF), reported by 122 non-Annex I Parties for the year 1994 or the closest year reported, totalled 11.7&amp;nbsp;billion tonnes (billion&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,000,000,000) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was the largest proportion of emissions (63%), followed by [[methane]] (26%) and [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) (11%).

The [[energy sector]] was the largest source of emissions for 70 Parties, whereas for 45 Parties the agriculture sector was the largest. Per capita emissions (in tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq, excluding LUCF) averaged 2.8&amp;nbsp;tonnes for the 122 non-Annex I Parties.
* The Africa region's [[aggregate data|aggregate]] emissions were 1.6&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 2.4&amp;nbsp;tonnes.
* The Asia and Pacific region's aggregate emissions were 7.9&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 2.6&amp;nbsp;tonnes.
* The Latin America and [[Caribbean]] region's aggregate emissions were 2&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 4.6&amp;nbsp;tonnes.
* The "other" region includes [[Albania]], Armenia, [[Azerbaijan]], Georgia, Malta, [[Republic of Moldova|Moldova]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. Their aggregate emissions were 0.1&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 5.1&amp;nbsp;tonnes.

Parties reported a high level of uncertainty in LUCF emissions, but in aggregate, there appeared to only be a small difference of 1.7% with and without LUCF. With LUCF, emissions were 11.9&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;tonnes, without LUCF, total aggregate emissions were 11.7&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;tonnes.

''Trends''

In several large developing countries and fast growing economies (China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, and Iran) GHG emissions have increased rapidly (PBL, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrialised countries will collectively meet 2010 Kyoto target |author=PBL |date=16 October 2009 |publisher=Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) website |url=http://www.pbl.nl/en/dossiers/COP13Bali/moreinfo/Industrialised-countries-will-collectively-meet-2010-Kyoto-target.html |accessdate=3 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409000327/http://www.pbl.nl/en/dossiers/COP13Bali/moreinfo/Industrialised-countries-will-collectively-meet-2010-Kyoto-target.html |archivedate=9 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, emissions in China have risen strongly over the 1990–2005 period, often by more than 10% year. Emissions per-capita in non-Annex I countries are still, for the most part, much lower than in industrialized countries. Non-Annex I countries do not have quantitative emission reduction commitments, but they are committed to mitigation actions. China, for example, has had a national policy programme to reduce emissions growth, which included the closure of old, less efficient coal-fired power plants.

Without US participation, and with full use of the Kyoto flexible mechanisms, costs were estimated at less than 0.05% of Annex B GDP. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.1–1.1%. Without use of the flexible mechanisms, costs without US participation were estimated at less than 0.1%. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.2–2%. These cost estimates were viewed as being based on much evidence and high agreement in the literature.

This has particularly centered on the balance between the low emissions and high vulnerability of the developing world to climate change, compared to high emissions in the developed world. Another criticism of the Kyoto Protocol and other international conventions, is the right of indigenous peoples right to participate. Quoted here from The Declaration of the [[International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Climate Change|First International Forum of Indigenous Peoples on Climate Change]], it says "Despite the recognition of our role in preventing global warming, when it comes time to sign international conventions like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, once again, our right to participate in national and international discussions that directly affect or Peoples and territories is denied."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51559162|title=Indigenous peoples and environmental issues : an encyclopedia|last=1950-|first=Johansen, Bruce E.

As mentioned earlier, a number of Annex I Parties have implemented emissions trading schemes (ETSs) as part of efforts to meet their Kyoto commitments. General commentaries on emissions trading are contained in [[emissions trading]] and [[carbon emission trading]]. Individual articles on the ETSs contain commentaries on these schemes (see [[Kyoto Protocol#International Emissions Trading]] for a list of ETSs).

One of the arguments made in favour of the flexibility mechanisms is that they can reduce the costs incurred by Annex I Parties in meeting their Kyoto commitments.&lt;ref name="toth flexibility mechanisms"/&gt; Criticisms of flexibility have, for example, included the ineffectiveness of emissions trading in promoting investment in non-fossil energy sources,&lt;ref&gt;

=== Philosophy ===
As the Kyoto Protocol seeks to reduce environmental pollutants while at the same time altering the freedoms of some citizens.

As discussed by [[Milton Friedman]], one can achieve both economic and political freedom through capitalism; nonetheless, it is never guaranteed that one is going to have equality of wealth of those on top of the "food chain" of this capitalistic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-02|title=Capitalist realism|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Capitalist_realism&amp;oldid=768189102|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these alterations come to what the leaders of the citizens choose to impose in means of improving ones lifestyle. In the case of the Kyoto Protocol, it seeks to impose regulations that will reduce production of pollutants towards the   environment. Furthermore, seeking to compromise the freedoms of both private and public citizens. In one side it imposes bigger regulations towards companies and reducing their profits as they need to fulfill such regulations with, which are oftentimes more expensive, alternatives for production. On the other hand, it seeks to reduce the emissions that potentially cause the rapid environmental change called [[climate change]].

The conditions of the Kyoto Protocol consist of mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions for the world's leading economies. As provided by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, "These targets range from -8 per cent to +10 per cent of the countries' individual 1990 emissions levels with a view to reducing their overall emissions of such gases by at least 5 per cent below existing 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/background/items/2879.php|title=A Summary of the Kyoto Protocol|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These goals are challenged, however, by climate change deniers, who condemn strong scientific evidence of the human impact on climate change. One prominent scholar opines that these climate change deniers "arguably" breach Rousseau's notion of the social contract, which is an implicit agreement among the members of a society to coordinate efforts in the name of overall social benefit. The climate change denial movement hinders efforts at coming to agreements as a collective global society on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFcdDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT93&amp;lpg=PT93&amp;dq=kyoto+protocol+social+contract&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=93zVaUURaH&amp;sig=LKlZaN4CNJJ9ZIDzvJBshK_6euo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiio4ya9bjSAhUrilQKHZ09BnwQ6AEIUDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=kyoto%20protocol%20social%20contract&amp;f=false|title=Remaking the Urban Social Contract: Health, Energy, and the Environment|last=Pagano|first=Michael A.|date=2016-08-30|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252099137|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference of the Parties==
{{further information|United Nations Climate Change conference}}
The official meeting of all states party to the Kyoto Protocol is the ''Conference of the Parties''. It is held every year as part of the United Nations Climate Change conference, which also serves as the formal meeting of UNFCCC. The first Meetings of Parties of the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) was held in 2005 in conjunction with the eleventh Conferences of parties to UNFCCC (COP). Also parties to the Convention that are not parties to the Protocol can participate in Protocol-related meetings as observers. The first conference was held in 1995 in Berlin, while the 2013 conference was held in [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Warsaw]]. Later COPs were held in Lima, Peru in 2014 and in Paris, France in 2015. COP 21 aims to hold the increase in the global average rise in temperature below 2 degree. COP 22 Marakash, Morocco and COP 23 in Bonn, Germany.

The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009 was one of the annual series of UN meetings that followed the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio. In 1997 the talks led to the Kyoto Protocol, and the conference in Copenhagen was considered to be the opportunity to agree a successor to Kyoto that would bring about meaningful carbon cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; At the Doha meeting of the parties to the UNFCCC on 8 December 2012, the European Union chief climate negotiator, Artur Runge-Metzger, pledged to extend the treaty, binding on the 27 European Member States, up to the year 2020 pending an internal ratification procedure.

Ban Ki Moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, called  on world leaders to come to an agreement on halting global warming during the 69th Session of the UN General Assembly&lt;ref&gt;http://sd.iisd.org/events/69th-session-of-the-un-general-assembly-unga-69&lt;/ref&gt; on 23 September 2014 in New York. UN member states have been negotiating a future climate deal over the last five years. A preliminary calendar was adopted to confirm "national contributions" to the reduction of CO2 emissions by 2015 before the UN climate summit which was held in Paris at the  [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]].

'''LexML Brasil''' (or ''LexML-BR'' or ''LexML Brazil'') is a project of [[Brazil]]'s [[Electronic Government]] initiative. Its objective is to establish open data systems, integrate work processes and share data, in the context of identifying and structuring [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[judiciary]] documents.  The ''LexML-BR'' standards define a set of simple technology-neutral electronic protocols and representations, based on [[XML]] and [[HTTP]] ecossistem.

While the project was officially launched on June 30, 2009, Brazil has been participating in the '''[[LexML]]''' community since 2006. In 2009, LexML became an explicit national data standard in the "[[:pt:e-PING]]".&lt;ref name="eping2010"&gt;
LexML standards was recommended in [http://www.governoeletronico.gov.br/documentos-e-arquivos/e-PING%20v2010%2011%2012%202009.pdf Documento de Referência e-PING v2010], section 10.5, "Areas of Integration for Electronic Government: Technical Specifications".
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eping2014"&gt;LexML continues to have the status "Adopted" in the [http://eping.governoeletronico.gov.br/#p2s5.1 2016 e-PING, Table 16].&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 2012, Brazil's "Public Access to Information" law  (''Lei de Acesso a Informações Públicas'') entered into force,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexml.gov.br/urn/urn:lex:br:federal:lei:2011-11-18;12527 Lei Federal 12.527 de 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; which strengthened the standing of LexML as a transparency tool that could assist in carrying out the obligation to publish government data in the areas of legislative and court documents.

== Schema ==
LexML's [[technical standard]]s allow efficient handling of an enormous quantity of legislative and court information available in [[Brasil]]. These include:

* ''[[w:XML Schema|XML-Schema]]'' of the full text of laws (in accordance with [http://www.lexml.gov.br/urn/urn:lex:br:federal:lei.complementar:1998-02-26;95 LCP-95]).  Technical Norm "LexML-BR Part 3".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dedicated resources ==
The main resources needed for the project are already in place:
* Permanent URLs ([[w:PURL|PURL]]) for the [[Uniform resource name#Resolvers|URN resolvers]]: http://www.lexml.gov.br/urn 
* Website search engine for laws, http://www.lexml.gov.br. Site specialized in laws, decrees, agreements and bills, among other documents at the federal, state and municipal level in all of Brazil.
* A toolset for the production and conversion of documents into specified formats.&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==
An early development at Brazil occurred at 1997, in a scholar initiative,&lt;ref name="dorante"&gt;Alessandra Dorante (1997), "Investigação de processo de conversão automática de textos estruturados para hiperdocumentos", [http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/76/76132/tde-15092010-164303/publico/AlessandraDoranteM.pdf Dissertação (Mestrado)].&lt;/ref&gt; with the modeling of the structure of Brazilians legislative documents, and the demonstration that all legislative documents can be automatically translated to HTML hypertext, with intra and inter links. The seminal algorithms (implemented&lt;ref name="dorante"/&gt; as [[Perl|Perl scripts]] and [[regular expressions]]) was lost one decade, rediscovered during the development of an important LexML tool, the  ''lexml-linker''.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/lexml/lexml-linker&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholar studies continued,&lt;ref&gt;Krauss and Lima (2004) "[http://www.nilc.icmc.usp.br/til/til2003/poster/krauss_Lima2.pdf Notação canônica para a citação de trechos de normas estatutárias jurídicas brasileiras]", In: TIL2003, "1º Workshop em Tecnologia da Informação e da Linguagem Humana, 2003".&lt;/ref&gt; and served as support to redirect the initial LexML-BR focus on ''XML schemas'' to [[metadata]] and ''URN schemas''.

The ''LexML-BR Project'' was started in ~2006, and had the LexML-IT as an antecedent,&lt;ref&gt;

On June 30, 2009, it was launched officially.&lt;ref&gt;
"Portal LEXML, o 'Google das Leis', busca a adesão dos Estados e municípios", [http://www.convergenciadigital.com.br/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?infoid=19374&amp;sid=4 notícia da Convergencia Digital]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://projeto.lexml.gov.br/ciclo-conferencias-sobre-organizacao-informacao-legislativa-juridica Launch program agenda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704014019/http://projeto.lexml.gov.br/ciclo-conferencias-sobre-organizacao-informacao-legislativa-juridica |date=2009-07-04 }}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now a joint initiaitve of many administrative bodies, including Brazil's legislature, executive and judiciary branches, part of the [http://www.ticontrole.gov.br IT Management Community], which combines the areas of legislative and court information.

The goals of the LexML Brazil project can be divided into two main areas:
* LexML 1.0: consists of the search engine, resolver service, generation of persistent identifiers and a "link service".
* LexML 2.0 (from 2010): wider adoption of open source tools for the production of documents, in accordance with the "LexML Brazil XML Schema".&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2010/10/15/lexml-brazil-project/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==

}}

In addition to the legal requirements in Brazil for transparency and publication of government documents (see [[:pt:LexML Brasil|Motivations]]), the sheer volume of legislation places a premium on digitization and better public access to digital forms of the law.

In 20 years, Brazil has produced approximately:&lt;ref name="Amaral04"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* federal laws: 150 thousand, an average of 21 per day.
* state laws: 1 million. On average 27 states produce 5 laws per day (135 laws per day total).
* municipal laws: 2.6 million laws, on average each of the 5700 municipalities produce 4 laws per week (360 laws per day in total).

There has been some research identifying this proliferation of laws and bureaucracy as partly responsible for many economic activities going 'underground'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26981">Below is a list of countries which have signed and [[Ratification|ratified]] one or more '''multilateral [[international copyright treaties]]'''.   This list covers only [[Multilateral treaty|multilateral treaties]] (i.e., treaties by more than two countries).  It does not include [[Bilateral treaty|bilateral treaties]] (treaties between only two countries).  [[Related rights]] provide [[intellectual property]] rights for performers, producers of sound recordings ([[Sound recording and reproduction|phonogram]]s) and broadcasting organisations. In some countries these rights are known simply as [[copyright]], while other countries distinguish them from [[authors' rights]]: in either case, the international laws which are concerned with them are distinct from those concerned with literary and artistic works under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] and other treaties.

The '''''Michigan Law Review''''' is an American [[law review]] that was established in 1902 and is completely run by law students. It is the flagship law journal of the [[University of Michigan Law School]] and one of the top law journals in the United States.

== History ==
The ''Michigan Law Review'' was established in 1902, after [[Gustavus Ohlinger]], a student in the [[University of Michigan Law School|Law Department]] (now the Law School) of the [[University of Michigan]], approached the dean with a proposal for a law journal.&lt;ref name="michiganlawreview.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michiganlawreview.org/history/|title=History - Michigan Law Review|website=michiganlawreview.org|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Michigan Law Review'' was originally intended as a forum in which the faculty of the Law Department could publish its legal scholarship. The faculty resolution creating the ''Michigan Law Review'' required every faculty member to submit two articles per year to the new journal.&lt;ref name="michiganlawreview.org"/&gt;

From its inception until 1940, the ''Michigan Law Review'''s student members worked under the direction of faculty members who served as [[editor-in-chief]].&lt;ref name="michiganlawreview.org"/&gt; The first of these was [[Floyd Mechem]], the last [[Paul Kauper]]. In 1940, the first student editor-in-chief was selected. During the years that followed, student editors were given increasing responsibility and autonomy; today, the ''Michigan Law Review'' is run with no faculty supervision.&lt;ref name="michiganlawreview.org"/&gt; The current editor-in-chief is Megan Brown. Day-to-day production operations are overseen by the current managing editor, [[Kristin Froehle]]. Seven of each volume's eight issues ordinarily are composed of two major parts: "Articles" by legal scholars and practitioners and "Notes" written by the student editors. One issue in each volume is devoted to book reviews. Occasionally special issues are devoted to symposia or colloquia.

== Rankings ==
In 2016, PrawfsBlawg ranked the ''Michigan Law Review'' as the 6th best law journal by weighing its Google Scholar Metrics law journal ranking, US News Peer Reputation Ranking, US News Overall Ranking, and the W&amp;L Combined Ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2016/04/2016-meta-ranking-of-flagship-us-law-reviews.html|title=PrawfsBlawg: 2016 Meta-Ranking of Flagship US Law Reviews|website=prawfsblawg.blogs.com|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/ranking-the-top-law-reviews/|title=Ranking The Top Law Reviews|first=Joe|last=Patrice|website=abovethelaw.com|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on data from 2009 through 2016, Washington and Lee University School of Law ranked the ''Michigan Law Review'' as the 7th best law journal.&lt;ref name="wlu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx|title=Law Journals: Submissions and Ranking|website=lawlib.wlu.edu|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Google Scholar Metrics, the ''Michigan Law Review'' was the 7th best law journal in 2015 and the 6th best law journal in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://witnesseth.typepad.com/blog/2016/02/google-law-review-rankings-2015-with-specialty-journals.html|title=Google Law Review Rankings 2015 with Specialty Journals|website=witnesseth.typepad.com|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://witnesseth.typepad.com/blog/2014/08/google-law-review-rankings-2014.html|title=Google Law Review Rankings 2014|website=witnesseth.typepad.com|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Washington and Lee University School of Law's Law Library, the ''Michigan Law Review'' is the 7th most cited law journal in academic works, being cited in journals 3888 times between 2009 and 2016, and the 6th most cited law journal by courts, being cited in 128 cases between 2009 and 2016.&lt;ref name="wlu.edu"/&gt; As of 2012, the ''Michigan Law Review'' has published 4 of the 100 most cited law journal articles of all time—the 5th highest of any law journal.&lt;ref name="umich.edu"&gt;http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&amp;context=mlr&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 95 articles that constitute the 5 most cited law journal articles from each year between 1991 and 2009, 9 of them were published by the ''Michigan Law Review''—the 5th most of any law journal.&lt;ref name="umich.edu"/&gt;

== Parody ==
The ''Michigan Raw Review'', a parody of the ''Michigan Law Review'', was published annually by the Barristers Society, a self-styled honorary at the University of Michigan Law School. The ''Raw Review'' used the same cover, layout, and typeface, but contained content totally dissimilar, leaning to the "insulting and semi-pornographic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/55586 Swift, Theodore W., "There's a unicorn in the garden", ''Law Quadrangle Notes'' (Fall, 1981)] Reprinted in Frazier, Richard, ''Let the Record Show'', Michigan State University Press, {{ISBN|0-87013-425-6}} (1997), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

''''Miller v. Skumanick'''' was a 2010 [[Third Circuit Court of Appeals]] case regarding the practice of [[sexting]] and its legal relationship to [[child pornography]].

==Background==
In October 2008, [[Tunkhannock Area School District]] officials confiscated several students' cellphones and found photographs of three female students, two were in their underwear and one was topless. No photos were exposed below the waist and no sexual acts were portrayed. He gave those photos as to [[Wyoming County, Pennsylvania|Wyoming County]] District Attorney George Skumanick, Jr.  Skumanick promised to file charges against those posing in the photographs for production of child pornography unless they agreed to probation, completed a six to nine month educational program which would require participants to submit an essay explaining why their actions were wrong.  No actions were proposed against the male students possessing and distributing the images. The three families collectively filed for a [[Injunction#Temporary restraining orders|temporary restraining order]] in [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania|district court]] to prevent the prosecution from taking place while they seek an injunction.  The restraining order was granted, and Skumanick appealed.

==Decision==
The plaintiffs argued that prosecution would amount to retaliation against their children's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to free expression and against compelled speech, and the parents' [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] substantive due process right to direct the upbringing of their children.  The appellate court upheld the temporary restraining order based on the second and third claims.  Specifically, the court affirmed that the students' First Amendment right against compelled speech would be violated by the program's requirement that the student involve explain why their actions were wrong, and the parents' Fourteenth Amendment rights would be violated by the program's moral nature.

The appellate court opinion in this matter did not address whether the pictures in question were pornographic in nature, as it instead ruled that there was no evidence that the plaintiffs ever possessed or distributed the photos.

'''''Nude Nuns with Big Guns''''' is a 2010 [[nunsploitation]] [[thriller film]] directed by Joseph Guzman and starring [[Asun Ortega]], David Castro, and Perry D'Marco.

The film was the subject of one of the largest copyright lawsuits in California.&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt;  The two lawsuits are the first time that two different companies claiming the intellectual-property rights of the same movie are each suing the same alleged 5,865 BitTorrent downloaders.&lt;ref name="Kravets3"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Two Firms Battle for Right to Sue Nude Nuns Downloaders|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/05/nude-nuns-brouhaha/|first=David |last=Kravets|date=May 9, 2011 |accessdate=May 9, 2011|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A young Mexican nun, named Sister Sarah, is neglected and abused by a corrupt clergy that produces and distributes heroin. After a bad drug deal, she is handed over to thugs to be used as an instrument as sex for money. On the verge of death after being heavily drugged and wounded and fingered, the nun receives a commandment from God to take revenge. Acquiring heavy weapons (including big guns and vibrators), Sister Sarah sets out to kill those who had abused her and are using the church for their own personal gain. The frightened drug lords in the church hires "Los Muertos", a violent motorcycle gang, to track her down and eliminate her.  Los Muertos' base of operations is the local brothel "Titty Flickers", where they to try and gather more information on the vigilante nun. After being wounded in a shootout, Sister Sarah hides out in a fleabag motel where she recovers and finally achieves vengeance by killing Los Muertos, degenitalizing Chavo (the brutal leader of Los Muertos), and saving her female lover who had been raped. But in the final scene, the clergy drug lord, known only as the Monsignor, hires another hit man to track down the vigilante nun, leaving the door wide open for a sequel.

==BitTorrent lawsuit==
On March&amp;nbsp;7, 2011, [[Camelot Entertainment Group]], a film company based in Los Angeles, filed a federal lawsuit, Case No. CV 11-1949 DDP (FMOx), in the District Court for the Central District of California, against BitTorrent users who allegedly downloaded the movie between January and {{Nowrap|March 2011}}.&lt;ref name="Kravets"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/03/bittorrent/|title=How Mass BitTorrent Lawsuits Turn Low-Budget Movies Into Big Bucks|last=Kravets|first=David|date=March 31, 2011|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired News]]|accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 3, 2011|title=Utynam's Heirs: Barefaced Cheek|journal=Managing IP Magazine|url=http://www.managingip.com/IssueArticle/2817237/Archive/Utynams-Heirs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit which targets 5,865 IP addresses, seeks to compel ISPs to identify the defendants from their IP addresses.&lt;ref name="Kravets"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/129413/20110401/p2p-bit-torrent-priaa-mpaa-film-hollywood-porn-isp-hurt-locker.htm|title=Porn Distributor 'joins 'em, to beat 'em' in P2P fight|date=April 1, 2011|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has until May&amp;nbsp;13 to "show cause why the Doe defendants should not be severed and/or dismissed from this action based on improper joinder of parties or lack of personal jurisdiction".&lt;ref name="Poulsen"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/04/nude-nuns-judge/|title=Nude Nuns Judge Questions Mass BitTorrent Lawsuit |last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|date=April 22, 2011|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired News]]|accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] will act as amicus counsel on the side of the defendants, who at this stage are known only by their internet IP addresses and rough geographic location.&lt;ref name="Poulsen"/&gt;

Incentive Capital of Utah also filed a nearly identical lawsuit against the same IP addresses with the same judge on May 6, 2011.&lt;ref name="Kravets3"/&gt;

On May 23, 2011, Camelot filed to dismiss their case, though the distribution group stated that they may refile the case in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="K4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/05/nude-nuns-curtains/|title=Nude Nuns Mass BitTorrent Lawsuit Killed, Clone Lives On|last=Kravets|first=David|date=May 24, 2011|work=Threat Level|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit filed by Incentive Capital was dropped on June 10, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/nude-nuns-lawsuit-ends/|title=Nude Nuns Mass BitTorrent Lawsuit is Terminated |last=Kravets|first=David|date=June 10, 2011|work=[[Wired News]]|accessdate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film rights==
Following the filing of the BitTorrent lawsuit, concerns have been raised as to whether Camelot Distribution Group actually owns the rights to the film.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/film-company-suing-thousands-pirates-173604|title=Film Company Suing Thousands of Pirates Might Have A Big Problem (Exclusive)|last=Gardner|first=Eriq|date=March 31, 2011|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poulsen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Studio Suing BitTorrent Pirates Does Not Own the Movie, Records Show|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/04/nude-nuns/|first=David |last=Kravets|date=April 1, 2011 |accessdate=April 27, 2011|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masnick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110331/16532013718/film-company-thats-sued-thousands-might-not-even-own-rights-to-film-its-suing-over.shtml|title=Film Company That's Sued Thousands Might Not Even Own Rights To Film It's Suing Over|last=Masnick|first=Mike|newspaper=[[TechDirt]]|accessdate=April 24, 2011|date=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camelot defaulted on a loan financed by Incentive Capital used to purchase the movie rights.&lt;ref name="Poulsen"/&gt; Though Incentive Capital has already foreclosed on the film,  Camelot has stated that the foreclosure was an improper "usurpation of its assets".&lt;ref name="Poulsen"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6474">'''Policy by press release''' refers to the act of attempting to influence [[public policy]] by [[press release]]s intended to alarm the public into demanding action from their [[elected official]]s. In modern times, the term is used to dismiss an opponent's claims by suggesting the arguments to be lacking in substance and created solely to generate media attention.

== Cold War ==

Perhaps the most common use of the term refers to an infamous period during the [[Eisenhower administration]] when "leaked" documents were a common way for the various branches of the [[US military]] to attempt to garner funding for their pet projects when traditional chains of command failed, or they actively ended them. Practically any idea, no matter how outlandish, could gain some traction by simply claiming that the [[Soviet Union]] was working on a similar device.

The first and most costly example of this behavior was the mythical "[[bomber gap]]." After seeing the latest Soviet designs in 1955, a clamor broke out in Washington about the Soviets developing a lead in deploying strategic bombers, with estimates that hundreds would be available shortly. The result was a massive expansion of the US building program, which led to the eventual introduction of about 2,500 jet bombers. Although it was not revealed at the time, US intelligence services had actually made real estimates of the size of the Soviet fleet as early as 1956 by placing it at around 20 aircraft.&lt;ref name="heppenheimer1998"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA | author=Heppenheimer, T. A. | year=1998 | page=193 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/contents.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the tactic of claiming the gap existed and then brushing aside any criticism as being "weak on defense," was so successful it led to a wave of similar claims.

Another famous case was a claim that suggested the Soviets were working on a global-range [[nuclear aircraft]]. An article, complete with images claimed to be leaked by a spy agency, appeared in the December 1958 issue of ''[[Aviation Week]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/site-files/aviationweek.com/files/uploads/2014/10/1958-%20Soviet%20Nuclear%20Bomber.pdf "Soviets Flight Testing Nuclear Bomber"], ''Aviation Week'', 1 December 1958, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The article described a system that was suspiciously similar to some of the designs that were currently under consideration by large US aviation companies. Concerns were soon expressed that "the Russians were from three to five years ahead of the US in the field of atomic aircraft engines and that they would move even further ahead unless the US pressed forward with its own program."&lt;ref&gt;''Soviet Nuclear Plane Possibility Conceded'', Ford Eastman, Aviation Week, 19 January 1959, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the entire article was a hoax; third parties later revealed that the aircraft appearing in the pictures was the entirely-conventional [[Myasishchev M-50]] ''Bounder'', which never entered production. The rumored aircraft was a nuclear-powered version of the [[Tupolev Tu-95]] bomber, called [[Tupolev Tu-119]]. The controversy managed to secure, for a time, continued funding of US efforts, which culminated in the [[Convair B-36#Experiments|NB-36]] testbed aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Norris, [http://aviationweek.com/blog/false-starts-aviation-s-atomic-age "False Starts For Aviation’s ‘Atomic Age’"], ''Aviation Week'', 14 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Another apparent case of policy by press release was the famous ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' article on [[flying saucer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Is this the real Flying Saucer?'', Look, Volume 19, 14 June 1955&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the [[US Air Force]] and then the [[US Army]] were funding the development of the [[Avrocar (aircraft)|Avrocar]] at [[Avro Canada]] in [[Toronto]]. The article, in the 14 June 1955 edition, suggested that the recent wave of saucer reports were possibly caused by Soviet flying saucers, and the article went on to describe them and their capabilities. It included several images that appeared to be provided to them by Avro Canada, or someone in contact with them, including a description of the control system, which was identical to the one used on the Avrocar. In the end, the concept proved unfeasible, and the Avrocar project was eventually cancelled in 1961. The article nevertheless remains famous, as it is often presented as a US government misinformation campaign to deflect attention away from "real" UFO's: to exactly what end varies by the source.

==Contemporary use==
The term is now more commonly used, especially in the US, to refer to [[environmental policy]], but it is still used in discussions of [[defense policy]]. Myriad claims asserting [[global warming]] or [[ozone depletion]] have been described by editorialists, such as Mark Martin, the Chronicle Sacramento Bureau,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/02/17/MNG56HAEPT1.DTL Governor to push global warming fight - Bold policy gambits expected in bid to lower greenhouse gases], San Francisco Chronicle, 17 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and Hugh Ellsaesser, as "policy by press release."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcenter.org/npa159.html Why the U.S. Should Withdraw from the Montreal Protocol], The National Center for Public Policy Research, February 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--BROKEN LINK:
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepp.org/key%20issues/ozone/ozonscare.html The Latest Ozone Scare: Policy by Press Release], Washington Times, 17 March 1992&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Likewise, the implication that Iraq was involved in the 9-11 attacks
or had [[weapons of mass destruction]], based on evidence that the CIA's own reports had dismissed, was described as "policy by press release" by [[John Kerry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3916793/ January 11, 2004 - Meet the Press]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lou Dobbs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0701/26/ldt.01.html CNN.com Transcripts: Lou Dobbs Tonight]&lt;/ref&gt;

A related term, ''public health by press release'', is occasionally used ironically to imply official pronouncements or media campaigns belie inadequate effort or funding, but the term appeared in an article warning against a pitfall from the opposite direction (potential misassessment of limited clinical studies by press and policymakers).&lt;ref&gt;"The perils of public health by press release," Lancet, 2004 Sep 18;364:1037-1038&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10957">The '''Reciprocal Tariff Act''' (enacted June 12, 1934, ch. 474, {{USStat|48|943}}, {{usc|19|1351}}) provided for the negotiation of [[tariff]] agreements between the United States and separate nations,  particularly [[Latin America]]n countries.&lt;ref&gt;"The Institutional Roots of American Trade Policy: Politics, Coalitions, and International Trade." Michael Bailey, Judith Goldstein, and Barry Weingast. World Politics, Volume 49, No. 3, 1997."&lt;/ref&gt; The Act served as an institutional reform intended to authorize the president to negotiate with foreign nations to reduce tariffs in return for reciprocal reductions in tariffs in the United States. It resulted in a reduction of duties.

== Reciprocal Tariff Act of 1934 ==

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (RTAA) into law in 1934.  RTAA gave the president power to negotiate bilateral, [[Trade pact|reciprocal trade agreement]]s with other countries.  This law enabled Roosevelt to liberalize [[Trade policy of the United States|American trade policy]] around the globe.  It is widely credited with ushering in the era of liberal [[trade policy]] that persisted through the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Hiscox"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hiscox|first=Michael J.|title=The Magic Bullet? The RTAA, Institutional Reform, and Trade Liberalization|journal=International Organization|date=Autumn 1999|volume=53|issue=4|pages=669–98|doi=10.1162/002081899551039|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/polisci243b/readings/v0002090.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tariff]]s in the United States were at historically high levels from the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] period through the 1920s.  In response to the [[Great Depression]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] accelerated its protectionist policies, culminating in the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act|Smoot–Hawley Act of 1930]].  The Smoot-Hawley Act was a smorgasbord of high tariffs across many American industries.  At the same time, countries in Europe enacted protectionist policies. The RTAA marked a sharp departure from the era of [[protectionism]] in the United States.  American duties on foreign products declined from an average of 46% in 1934 to 12% by 1962.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Michael A.|author2=Goldstein, Weingast |title=The Institutional Roots of American Trade Policy|journal=World Politics|date=April 1997|volume=49|pages=309–38|doi=10.1353/wp.1997.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How the RTAA was different from other trade agreements ===
Before the RTAA, if Congress wanted to establish a lower tariff for particular [[import]]s, it would act unilaterally, taking the foreign country's tariff rate as fixed. Congress would choose a tariff rate that was either a little higher or lower than the median preferred tariff, depending upon the composition of the Congress.  Generally, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] controlled Congress would prefer higher tariffs and a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] controlled Congress would prefer lower tariffs.  Thus, tariffs were chosen based on the [[domestic politics]] of the United States.  Individual members of Congress were under great pressure from industry [[lobbyist]]s to raise tariffs to protect them from the negative effects of foreign imports.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;   
	
The RTAA’s novel approach freed Roosevelt and Congress to break this trend of tariff increases.  First, it tied tariff reductions by the United States to reciprocal tariff reductions with international partners. It also allowed Congress to approve the tariffs with a [[majority|simple majority]], as opposed to the requisite [[two-thirds majority]] necessary for other treaties.  Lastly, the president had the authority to negotiate the terms.  These three innovations in trade policy created the political will and feasibility to enact a more liberal American trade policy.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; 
	
[[Reciprocity (international relations)|Reciprocity]] was an important tenet of the [[trade agreement]]s brokered under RTAA because it gave Congress more of an incentive to lower tariffs.  As more foreign countries entered into bilateral tariff reduction deals with the United States, American exporters had more incentive to lobby Congress for even lower tariffs across many industries.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; 
	
By giving the President the authority to negotiate these deals, the Congress effectively ceded a part of their power (authorized under US Constitution, Article I, Section VIII) to the executive branch.  The President had to consider the aggregate welfare of all Americans, his [[foreign policy]] priorities, and what was feasible with other countries in making his decisions on tariffs. These considerations generally left presidents more inclined to reduce tariffs than the Congress.&lt;ref name="Alt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alt|first=James E.|author2=Gilligan, Michael |title=The Political Economy of Trading States: Factor Specificity, Collective Action Problems and Domestic Political Institutions|journal=The Journal of Political Philosophy|year=1994|volume=2|issue=2|pages=165–92|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9760.1994.tb00020.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Whether Roosevelt or Congress foresaw this result is a matter of historical debate.

=== The historical partisan divide over tariffs and the RTAA ===
After the Civil War, Democrats were generally the party of [[trade liberalization]], while Republicans were generally for higher tariffs. This pattern was clear in congressional votes for tariffs from 1860 until 1930. Democrats were the congressional minority in the majority of Congresses between the Civil War and the election of Roosevelt. During their brief stints in the majority, Democrats passed several tariff reduction bills. Examples include the [[Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act|Wilson–Gorman Act of 1894]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1913|Underwood Tariff Act of 1913]]. However, subsequent Republican majorities always undid these unilateral tariff reductions.&lt;ref name="Hiscox"/&gt; 
	
By the Great Depression, tariffs were at historic highs. Members of Congress commonly entered in informal ''[[quid pro quo]]'' agreements where they voted for other members’ preferred tariffs in order to secure support for their own. At no point did anyone take into account the aggregate toll on American [[consumer]]s or [[exporter]]s. This practice is commonly referred to as [[logrolling]]. President Roosevelt and key members of his administration were intent on stopping this practice.&lt;ref name="Alt"/&gt;  
	
Though Democrats voted for trade liberalization far more often than Republicans, they were not uniform in their preferences. Democrats skeptical of reducing tariffs during the Depression included Representative [[Henry Rainey]] (D-IL) and members of Roosevelt’s own administration – [[Rexford Tugwell]], [[Raymond Moley]] and [[Adolf Berle]]. However, the administration decided to take advantage of having a Democratic-controlled Congress and Presidency to push through the RTAA. In 1936 and 1940, the Republican Party ran on a platform of repealing the tariff reductions secured under the RTAA. But when they won back Congress in 1946, they did not act to remove the tariffs. In the years since the enactment of the RTAA in 1934, the economies of Europe and [[East Asia]] had been decimated by the violence of [[World War II]]. This left a huge global production vacuum that was filled by American exporters.&lt;ref name="Hiscox"/&gt; In the World War II period, the United States had its highest positive account balance in its history. Republican preferences for tariffs started shifting as exporters from their home districts began to benefit from increased [[international trade]]. By the 1950s, there was no statistically significant difference between Republicans and Democrats on tariff policies. This change has endured to the present day.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

=== The durability of the RTAA ===

Another key feature of the RTAA was the fact that if Congress wanted to repeal a tariff reduction, it would take a two-thirds [[supermajority]]. That means that the tariff would have to be especially onerous and that the Congress would have to be especially protectionist. Once enacted, tariff reductions tended to stick.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; 
	
As more American [[Industry|industries]] began to benefit from tariff reductions, some of them began to lobby Congress for lower tariffs. Prior to RTAA, Congress was mostly lobbied by industries seeking to create or increase tariffs to protect their industry. This change also helped to lock in many of the gains in trade liberalization. In short, the political [[incentive]] to raise tariffs decreased while the political incentive to lower tariffs increased.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

=== How RTAA changed the world ===
As American duties dropped off dramatically, global markets also increasingly liberalized. World trade expanded at a rapid pace. The RTAA, though a law of the United States, provided the first widespread system of guidelines for bilateral trade agreements. The United States and the European nations began avoiding [[beggar thy neighbour]] policies (which pursued national trade objectives at the expense of other nations). Instead, countries started to realize the gains from trade cooperation.
	
Led by the United States and the United Kingdom, international cooperation flourished and concrete institutions were created. In talks begun at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] of 1944, the [[International Monetary Fund]] was created. By 1949, the first international board governing trade, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was established. In 1994, GATT was replaced with the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which oversees international trade agreements today.&lt;ref name="Oatley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oatley|first=Thomas|title=International Political Economy|year=2010|pages=71–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruggie|first=John Gerard|title=International regimes, transactions, and change: embedded liberalism in the postwar economic order|journal=International Organization|date=Spring 1982|volume=36|series=2|pages=379–415|doi=10.1017/s0020818300018993}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
The [[United States Department of State]] also found good use of the expansion of [[free trade]] after [[World War II]]. Many in the State Department saw multilateral trade agreements as a way to engage the world in accordance with the [[Marshall Plan]] and the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. US trade policy became an integral part of [[United States foreign policy|US foreign policy]]. This pursuit of free-trade-cum-[[diplomacy]] intensified during the [[Cold War]], as the United States competed with the [[Soviet Union]] for relationships around the globe.&lt;ref name="Oatley"/&gt;

[[File:Former Saudi-Kuwaiti Neutral Zone en.svg|thumb|300px|right|&lt;center&gt;The Saudi–Kuwait Neutral Zone&lt;BR&gt;
(2 December 1922 – 18 January 1970).&lt;BR&gt;
(Established by the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair Convention]] of December 1922.)&lt;/center&gt;]]
The '''Saudi–Kuwaiti neutral zone''', also known as the '''Divided Zone''', was an area of {{Convert|5,770|km2||abbr=on}} between the borders of [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]] that was left undefined when the border was established by the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair Convention]] of 2 December 1922.

In the area, which was later called the "Neutral Zone" or "Divided Zone", the Uqair Convention stated that "the Government of [[Kingdom of Nejd|Najd]] and Kuwait will share equal rights until through the good offices of the Government of [[United_Kingdom|Great Britain]] a further agreement is made between Najd and Kuwait concerning it".

However, there was little interest in a more definitive settlement in the so-called "Neutral Zone" until the discovery, in 1938, of oil in the [[Burgan Field|Burgan]] (Burqan) of [[Kuwait]]. With the possibility of oil discovery within the "Neutral Zone" itself, concessions were granted in 1948–1949 by each government to private companies. Later the two countries exploited the oil under a joint operating agreement.

In 1957, Saudi Arabia signed a concession agreement with the Japanese-owned Arab Oil Co., and Kuwait signed in 1958.  That concession expired in 2000.&lt;ref name="Ali"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Naimi |first1=Ali |title=Out of the Desert |date=2016 |publisher=Portfolio Penguin |location=Great Britain |isbn=9780241279250 |pages=173,234-236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partitioning negotiations commenced shortly after the rulers of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia met and decided, in October 1960, that the Neutral Zone should be divided. On 7 July 1965, the two governments signed an agreement (which took effect on 25 July 1966) to partition the Neutral Zone adjoining their respective territories. A demarcation agreement dividing the Neutral Zone was signed on 17 December 1967 but did not formally take effect until the exchange of instruments and signing which took place in Kuwait on 18 December 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meij.or.jp/text/border/KSA-Kuwait/ksakwt1969.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050109064808/http://www.meij.or.jp/text/border/KSA-Kuwait/ksakwt1969.htm |archivedate=2005-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratification followed on 18 January 1970, and the agreement was published in the ''Kuwaiti Official Gazette'' on 25 January 1970.

The zone was never assigned an [[ISO 3166]] code since it was partitioned before the adoption of ISO 3166 in 1974.

{{Update|reason=Uniform Guidance in 2 CFR 200 Subpart F has superseded OMB Circular A-133|date=February 2018}}
In the United States, the '''Single Audit''', Subpart F of the '''OMB Uniform Guidance''', is a rigorous, organization-wide [[audit]] or examination of an entity that expends $750,000 or more of [[administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal assistance]] (commonly known as [[federal funds]], [[federal grant]]s, or federal awards) received for its operations.&lt;ref name="OFFM"&gt;OMB Office of Federal Financial Management, [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial/fin_single_audit.html The Single Audit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507211049/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial/fin_single_audit.html |date=2009-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a133_200"&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/a133/a133_revised_2007.pdf OMB Circular A-133]; Subpart B – ''Audits''; §___.200 – ''Audit requirements'',&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;[http://www.tgci.com/magazine/02fall/audit1.asp ''Understanding Single Audits''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920140654/http://www.tgci.com/magazine/02fall/audit1.asp |date=2006-09-20 }} by Henry Flood, Grantsmanship Center Magazine, Fall 2002, retrieved on June 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Usually performed annually,&lt;ref name="a133_220"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart B – ''Audits''; §___.220 – ''Frequency of audits''&lt;/ref&gt; the Single Audit's objective is to provide [[Assurance (accounting)|assurance]] to the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] as to the management and use of such funds by [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States#Recipients|recipients]] such as states, cities, universities, non-profit organizations, and Indian Tribes. The audit is typically performed by an independent [[certified public accountant]] (CPA) and encompasses both financial and [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]] components. The Single Audits must be submitted to the [[Federal Audit Clearinghouse]] along with a data collection form, Form SF-SAC.

==History==
Before implementing the Single Audit, the federal government relied on numerous audits carried out on individual federally funded programs to ensure these funds were spent properly. Because the government had numerous agencies awarding hundreds of different programs, the task of auditing all programs became increasingly difficult and time consuming. To improve this situation, the Single Audit Act of 1984 standardized audit requirements for States, local governments, and Indian tribal governments that receive and use federal financial assistance programs.&lt;ref name="OMB_intro"&gt;OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part I: Background, Purpose and Applicability; Background; pg. 1-1, par. 1 through 4 and pg. 1–2, par. 1 through 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) issued OMB Circular A-128, "Audits of State and Local Governments," to help recipients and auditors implement the new Single Audit. In 1990, OMB administratively extended the Single Audit process to non-profit organizations by issuing OMB Circular A-133, "Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Organizations" which superseded OMB A-128. These new guides and provisions standardized the Single Audit in the United States to include all states, local governments, non-profit organizations, and institutions that receive federal funds from the US government.&lt;ref name="a133_200"&gt;OMB Circular A-133 Subpart A – ''General''; §___.100 – ''Purpose''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OMB_intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a133_200(1)"&gt;OMB Circular A-133 Title 1 – ''Purpose''&lt;/ref&gt; On December 26, 2013, OMB issued the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, which standardized compliance and audit requirements for government entities, non-profit organizations and institutions of higher education.&lt;ref name="Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/12/26/2013-30465/uniform-administrative-requirements-cost-principles-and-audit-requirements-for-federal-awards|title=Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards|date=26 December 2013|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These consolidated requirements are codified in Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 200 with the single audit requirements in Subpart F of this section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ab9ff8f4b35e7a1839a52514e2e69c34&amp;mc=true&amp;node=sp2.1.200.f&amp;rgn=div6|title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations|website=www.ecfr.gov|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms 2 CFR 200 and Uniform Guidance can be used interchangeably.

==Purpose and components==
The federal government provides an extensive array of federal assistance to recipients reaching over $400 billion annually.&lt;ref name="OFFM"/&gt; This assistance is provided through thousands of individual grants and awards annually for the purpose of benefiting the general public in the areas of education, health, public safety, welfare, and public works, among others. However, as a condition of receiving this assistance recipients must comply with applicable federal and state [[United States law|laws and regulations]], as well as any particular provisions tied with the specific assistance.&lt;ref name="OMB_intro3"&gt;OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part I: Background, Purpose and Applicability; Overview of this Supplement; Internal Control; pg. 1–6, par. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Single Audit provides the Federal government with assurance that these recipients comply with such directives by having an independent external source (the CPA) report on such compliance. However, it only applies to state, local government, and nonprofit recipients that expend $750,000 or more of such assistance in one year.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070621150845/http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/financial/fin_single_audit.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041012/http://www.aicpa.org/audcommctr/toolkitsnpo/Single_Audit_Act.htm|title=Single Audits Circular No. A-133: Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations|date=27 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Single Audit encompasses an examination of a recipient's financial records, [[financial statements]], federal award transactions and [[expenditure]]s, the general management of its operations, internal control systems, and federal assistance it received during the audit period (the time period of recipient operations examined in the Single Audit, which is usually covers a natural or fiscal year).&lt;ref name="Flood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a133_500"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of Audit''&lt;/ref&gt; The Single Audit is divided into two areas: Compliance and Financial.

The compliance component of a Single Audit covers the study and understanding (planning stage) as well as the testing and evaluation (exam stage) of the recipient with respect to federal assistance usage, operations and compliance with laws and regulations.&lt;ref name="a133_500"/&gt; The financial component is exactly like a [[financial audit]] of a non-federal entity which includes the audit of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Depending on the recipient, the Single Audit can be simple and straightforward, or it could be complex and troublesome. This is because there are millions of federal grants awarded each year to thousands of recipients, each with its own independent way of operating. Therefore, the Single Audit differs from recipient to recipient and from federal program to program.

For these reasons, the federal government requires auditors to perform the compliance audit of a recipient with a planning stage and an exam stage. During the first stage, or planning stage, the auditor must study the recipient, determine whether there is a high or low risk that the recipient does not comply with laws and regulations, identify federal programs, and evaluate such programs. The second stage, or exam or audit stage, is where the auditor actually audits the federal assistance and programs.&lt;ref name="a133_500"/&gt; The planning stage is considered an integral part of the Single Audit because it allows the auditor to design and perform the audit based on the qualities, characteristics and needs of the recipient to be audited.

==Compliance audit: planning stage==

===Low- or high-risk auditee===
Before determining which federal programs to examine, the auditor must first determine, based on specific criteria, whether the recipient is a '''high-risk''' auditee or a '''low-risk''' auditee. A high-risk auditee is a recipient which has a high risk of not complying with federal laws and regulations, while a low-risk auditee is the exact opposite. The Uniform Guidance has set certain requirements a recipient must meet to be considered a low-risk auditee. This includes the following to be evaluated for each of the preceding two audit periods:&lt;ref name="a133_530"&gt;2 CFR 200.520&lt;/ref&gt;

* Single audits have been performed on an annual basis in prior years.
* The auditor's opinions on the [[financial statements]] and the Schedule of Federal Expenditures (discussed later) were unmodified.
* There are no material weaknesses identified.
* The auditor did not report a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern.
*None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two audit periods in which they were classified as Type A programs:
**Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control for major programs;
**A modified opinion on a major program in the auditor's report on major programs; or
**Known or likely questioned costs that exceeded five percent of the total Federal awards expended for a Type A program during the audit period.

The Uniform Guidance uses the high and low risk determination to regulate the dollar amount of federal expenditures to be audited. Although the actual work necessary for a Single Audit is established by the auditor, the OMB has set a limit for auditing high-risk and low-risk auditees. For high-risk auditees, the auditor is required to audit not less than 40% of all the federal assistance received during the year. For low-risk auditees, that limit is decreased to 20%.&lt;ref name="a133_520f"&gt;2 CFR 200.518(f)&lt;/ref&gt;

This determination affects the entire Single Audit because the auditor adjusts the scope of the audit accordingly. Since the auditor must provide an opinion to the federal government on whether the recipient and its programs complied with laws and regulations, the auditor performs sufficient procedures to confirm the opinion is correct.&lt;ref name="a133_500d4"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of audit''; section (d)(4) – ''Compliance''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification of major programs===

==== Step 1: Type A or Type B ====
To determine which federal programs to audit under the compliance audit, federal assistance expended by the recipient (also called '''federal expenditures''') during one year is identified by federal program name, Federal agency and [[Federal assistance in the United States#Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance#CFDA number|CFDA number]]. These federal expenditures are then combined to determine the total amount expended during the year. Any recipient whose total federal expenditures during a year equal or exceed $750,000 requires a Single Audit.&lt;ref&gt;2 CFR 200.501&lt;/ref&gt; If the recipient does not meet this threshold, a Single Audit is not required, although the recipient may elect to have a program-specific audit (an audit of a single federal program, without auditing the entire entity). Once this determination is performed, 2 CFR 200.518 requires that federal programs be categorized in two groups: Type A programs and Type B programs.&lt;ref name="a133_520b"&gt;2 CFR 200.518&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Type A program''' – a Type A program is any federal program within a recipient that meets the following criteria:
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than or equal to $750,000 and less than or equal to $25 million, then any program that expends more than $750,000 is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $25 million and less than or equal to $100 million, then any program that expends more than 3% of total federal awards is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $100 million and less than or equal to $1 billion, then any program that expends more than $3 million is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $1 billion and less than or equal to $10 billion, then any program that expends more than 0.3% of total federal awards is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $10 billion and less than or equal to $20 billion, then any program that expends more than $30 million is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $20 billion, then any program that expends more than 0.15% of total federal awards is Type A.
In other words, if a recipient expended a total of $25 million or less in federal assistance, then any single program which expended $750,000 or more is considered a Type A. If a recipient expended $30 million in federal assistance, then any single program which expended $900,000 or more (3% × $30,000,000) is considered a Type A program.&lt;ref name="a133_520b"/&gt; Special consideration must be given to large loan programs in determining the Type A threshold.
* '''Type B program''' – A Type B program is any single program which does not meet the Type A requirements.&lt;ref name="a133_520b2"&gt;2 CFR 200.518(b)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
Example 1 – The City of Example operates a Section 8 program, and expended $950,000 in Section 8 funds and $5,000,000 of total federal assistance during the year. Since this amount does not exceed $25,000,000, the Section 8 program is considered a Type A program because $950,000 exceeds the $750,000 threshold.

Example 2 – Using the same data in Example 1 with the exception that the City of Example now expended a total of $30,000,000 in federal assistance, the Section 8 program would meet the Type A threshold because $950,000 is greater than $30,000,000 x 3% ($900,000).

Example 3 – Using the same data in Example 1 with the exception that the City of Example now expended a total of $100,000,000 in federal assistance, the Section 8 program would not meet the Type A threshold because $950,000 is less than $3 million, and would be considered a Type B program.

====Step 2 &amp; 3: Risk assessment====
{{main|Risk assessment}}

After determining which programs are Type A and Type B, the Uniform Guidance requires that the auditor study and understand the operations and internal controls of such programs within the entity, and perform&lt;ref name="a133_520c"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.520 – ''Major program determination''; section (c) – ''Step 2''&lt;/ref&gt; and document&lt;ref name="a133_520g"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.520 – ''Major program determination''; section (g) – ''Documentation of risk''&lt;/ref&gt; a [[risk assessment]] based on such study to determine whether each program has either a high or low risk of not complying with laws and regulations. Auditor may consider numerous factors including current and prior audit experience, good or poor internal controls over Federal programs, many or no prior audit findings, continuous or lack of oversight exercised by the federal government over the recipient, evidence or knowledge of fraud, and the inherent risk of the Federal program.&lt;ref name="a133_525"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.525 – ''Criteria for Federal program risk''&lt;/ref&gt;

For a Type A program to be considered low risk according to 2 CFR 200.518, it must have been audited as a major program at least once in the past two years and must not have had:&lt;ref name="a133_520b"/&gt;
* Material weaknesses in internal control
* A modified opinion in the audit report
* Known or likely questioned costs exceeding 5% of total federal award expenditures

For any Type A program considered to be a high risk of not complying, the Uniform Guidance requires that the auditor to perform a compliance audit on that program.&lt;ref name="a133_520e"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.520 – ''Major program determination''; section (e) – ''Step 4''&lt;/ref&gt; For a Type A program that is considered to be of low risk, then the auditor is not required to perform a compliance audit, although the Uniform Guidance allows the auditor to do so if he/she chooses to.&lt;ref name="a133_520e" /&gt; Although the risk assessment is performed by the auditor based on his/her judgment,&lt;ref name="a133_525" /&gt; the Uniform Guidance does have two requirements for a program to be considered low risk.

In assessing the risk of Type B programs, auditors should use professional judgement and criteria established in the Uniform Guidance. According to 2 CFR 200.518, a minimum number of Type B programs must be identified as high risk, calculated as 25% of the number of low-risk Type A programs (rounded up). In assessing risk, auditors are encouraged to use an approach that allows different programs to be identified as high risk over time. The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on smaller Type B programs with expenditures that do not exceed 25% of the Type A threshold determined in step 1. Type B programs which have a low risk of not complying are not required to be audited.&lt;ref name="a133_520b"/&gt;

==== Step 4: Major program determination &amp; percentage of coverage ====
High-risk Type A and high-risk Type B programs are considered major programs and must be audited. The auditor then totals all of the federal award expenditures for the identified major programs and divides by the total federal award expenditures for the entity as a whole. For low-risk auditees, major program expenditures as a percentage of total award expenditures must be at least 20%. For high-risk auditees, the required coverage percentage is increased to 40%. If the identified major programs do not meet the required coverage percentage, then the auditor must select additional programs to audit until the required coverage percentage is met.&lt;ref name="a133_520b"/&gt;

==Compliance audit: exam stage==
After the auditor determines which federal programs to audit, the auditor performs a compliance audit that scrutinizes operations of the program—examining files, documents, contracts, checks, etc. The auditor investigates, to some degree, transactions between the federal program and other parties. These functions are compared with the laws and regulations applicable to a program to see if they complied or not. The examination does not require observing every single document and every single process generated by the program, nevertheless the auditor is required to perform enough procedures to form an opinion on whether the program (as a whole) complied with laws and regulations.&lt;ref name="a133_500d"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of audit''; section (d) – ''Compliance''&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the amount of federal regulations, the federal government has provided certain guides and literature to assist the auditor in the examination, which includes the OMB Compliance Supplement and the Compliance requirements:&lt;ref name="a133_500d"/&gt;

===OMB compliance supplement===
The OMB Compliance Supplement is a large and extensive guide created by the OMB for Single Audits, and is considered the most important tool of both the auditor and the recipient when performing, or being subject to, a Single Audit.&lt;ref name="OMB_intro"/&gt; It was created following amendments in 1996 to the Single Audit Act and serves to identify existing important compliance requirements that the Federal Government expects to be considered as part of a Single Audit. Without it, auditors would need to research thousands of laws and regulations for each single program of a recipient to determine which compliance requirements are important to the Federal Government. For Single Audits, the Supplement replaces any agency audit guides and other audit requirement documents for individual Federal programs.&lt;ref name="OMB_intro"/&gt;

===Compliance requirements===
{{main|Compliance requirements}}

Compliance requirements are series of directives provided by Federal agencies that summarize hundreds of laws and regulations applicable to federal assistance and are important to the successful management of such assistance. The OMB created 14 basic and standard compliance requirements for which recipients must always comply with when receiving and using federal assistance, and provided detailed explanations, discussions, and guidance about them in the OMB Compliance Supplement.&lt;ref name="OMB_cr"&gt;OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part III: Compliance Requirements&lt;/ref&gt; These compliance requirements only serve as guidelines for compliance with the specific laws and regulations applicable to the assistance and their objectives are designed to be generic in nature, because of the amount of different federal programs provided by the government. For example, many federal programs have eligibility requirements for individuals or organizations to participate in such programs because they have been established by either laws, regulations, or contract provisions. However, while the criterion for determining eligibility varies from program to program, the objective of the Eligibility compliance requirement that "only eligible and qualified individuals or organizations participate" is consistent and universal across all federal assistance programs. This eligibility universal criteria is called the '''Eligibility''' compliance requirement.&lt;ref name="OMB_E"&gt;OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part III: Compliance Requirements, pg. 3-E-1, Eligibility&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial audit==
{{main|Financial audit}}

The Single Audit requires that a recipient prepare [[financial statements]] that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited.&lt;ref name="a133_310a"&gt;2 CFR 200.510(a)&lt;/ref&gt; It also requires that a [[financial audit]] be performed on the recipient, which includes the federal assistance operations as well as the non-federal assistance operations. Tests of transactions and account balances are performed to ensure that the information presented in the financial statements, and [[notes to the financial statements|notes]] thereof, are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.&lt;ref name="a133_500b"&gt;2 CFR 200.514(b)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the recipient must prepare a Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA), which is supplementary information to the financial statements unique to recipients of federal assistance that details all the federal assistance expended by the recipient during the year, categorized by federal program.&lt;ref name="a133_310b"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart C – ''Auditees''; §___.310 – ''Financial Statements''; section (b) – ''Schedule of Federal Expenditures''&lt;/ref&gt; The auditor must then audit and report on this Schedule "in relation to" the financial statements as a whole.

==Data Collection and Reporting Package==
After the Single Audit is concluded, the recipient prepares two documents: a "Data Collection Form and a "Reporting Package". The data collection form, Form SF-SAC, is a standard form which is basically a summary of the Single Audit. It includes details of the auditor, a list of the federal programs audited, and a summary of any audit findings reported by the auditor. The Reporting Package includes all the auditor's final reports along with the recipient's financial statements. It includes:&lt;ref name="a133_320c"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart C – ''Auditees''; §___.320 – ''Report submission''; section (c) – ''Reporting Package''&lt;/ref&gt;

* Auditor's reports
* Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A) – This serves as an introduction to the recipient's financial statements where the recipient's management (e.g., Governors, in the case of states; Mayors, in the case of cities; President, in the case of non-profit organizations, etc.) discusses the results of operations and other financial information, offering insight and detailed description about the recipient itself.
* Recipient's financial statements – This contains the financial statements required by the [[Governmental Accounting Standards Board]] (GASB), which includes the Government-wide statements as well as the Fund Financial Statements.
* Recipient's [[notes to the financial statements]] – This includes any notes and disclosures for the financial statements as required by [[US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP).
* Supplemental Information – This section includes both financial and non-financial information relative to the recipient which is not covered in the MD&amp;A or the financial statements and their respective notes.
* Schedule of Federal Award Expenditures – This document details all federal assistance expenditures made by the recipient during the audit period, categorized by the federal program and federal agency.
* Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs – If the auditor finds situations where the recipient did not comply with laws and regulations, where internal controls are deficient, or a situation of illegal acts or fraud, the auditor is required to report such situations to the federal government in this section, as well as any questioned costs. Questioned costs are amounts that the recipient expended, but which the auditor has determined that they were not permitted and must be returned to the federal government.&lt;ref name="a133_505"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.505 – ''Audit reporting''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Schedule of Prior Audit Findings – In this section, the auditor is required to follow up and report about the recipient's corrective action on any audit findings reported in prior years.

Both the Data Collection and the Reporting Package are kept by the recipient with copies submitted to the [[Federal Audit Clearinghouse]] (FAC), and to any Federal agency who specifically requests it.&lt;ref name="a133_320c"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart C – ''Auditees''; §___.320 – ''Report submission''; section (d) – Submission to clearinghouse''&lt;/ref&gt; Federal guidelines require recipients to submit the documents no more than 30 days after the auditor submits his reports or 9 months after the final day of the audit period, whichever comes first.&lt;ref name="a133_320"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart C – ''Auditees''; §___.320 – ''Report submission''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditor responsibility==
The auditor is responsible for conducting the actual audit of the recipient in accordance with [[Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards]] (GAGAS)&lt;ref name="a133_500a"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of audit''; section (a) – ''General''&lt;/ref&gt; and using the guidance provided by the OMB Circular A-133 and its Compliance Supplement, all of which establish certain rules to follow during the Single Audit. The auditor must establish audit objectives that determine whether the recipient complied with laws and regulations. They must research the recipient's federal assistance awards and programs to determine applicability of specific laws and regulations. They must understand the recipient, its organization, operations, internal control systems, and ability to responsibly manage federal assistance. They must perform audit procedures (some of which are suggested by the Compliance Supplement) to meet these audit objectives.

The auditor must understand the recipient's internal control system to determine if the recipient has proper safeguards that help manage federal assistance responsibly. After obtaining sufficient knowledge of that system, the auditor must perform audit procedures to verify the recipient's internal control system works properly, and the recipient's federal program operations comply with laws and regulations (e.g., the compliance audit portion of the Single Audit).&lt;ref name="Flood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a133_500c"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of audit''; section (c) – ''Internal control''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AICPA"&gt;''The Single Audit Act'', AICPA&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Single Audit, the auditor must prepare and submit three individual reports to the recipient and to the federal government. The first report is an opinion, or a disclaimer thereof, on whether the recipient's financial statements are presented in conformity with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, identical to a financial audit's report on a non-recipient entity. The second report is about the status of internal controls relative to the financial statements and major programs. The third report is an opinion, or a disclaimer thereof, on the degree to which the recipient has complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the federal assistance awards. Following the last two reports, if the Single Audit produced audit findings, the auditor must prepare the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs discussed earlier.&lt;ref name="a133_505"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AICPA"/&gt;

The auditor's judgment is necessary to determine which audit procedures are sufficient to achieve the audit objectives, and whether additional or alternative audit procedures are needed to achieve such objectives. The auditor is responsible for determining the nature, timing, and extent of the audit procedures necessary to meet the audit objectives (i.e., it is the auditor who determines the necessary amount of his/her audit work needed to form an opinion on whether the recipient complied with laws and regulations).

{{US Constitution article series}}
[[File:16th Amendment Pg1of1 AC.jpg|190px|thumb|The Sixteenth Amendment in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]
The '''Sixteenth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XVI''') to the [[United States Constitution]] allows the Congress to levy an [[income tax]] without apportioning it among [[U.S. state|the states]] or basing it on the [[United States Census]]. This amendment exempted income taxes from the constitutional requirements regarding [[Direct tax#U.S. constitutional law|direct taxes]], after income taxes on rents, dividends, and interest were ruled to be direct taxes in the court case of ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.]]'' (1895). The amendment was adopted on February 3, 1913.

==Text==
{{quote|The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on [[Income tax in the United States|incomes]], from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.}}

==Other Constitutional provisions regarding taxes==
[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], Section 2, Clause 3:

{{quote|Representatives and [[Direct tax#U.S. constitutional law|direct taxes]] shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers...&lt;ref&gt;''Knowlton v. Moore'' {{ussc|178|41|1900}} and ''[[Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.]]'' {{ussc|220|107|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Article I, Section 8, Clause 1:

{{quote|The Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.}}

Article I, Section 9, Clause 4:

{{quote|No [[Tax per head|Capitation]], or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.}}

This clause basically refers to a tax on property, such as a tax based on the value of land,&lt;ref name=hylton&gt;''[[Hylton v. United States]]'' {{ussc|3|171|1796}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a capitation.

Article I, Section 9, Clause 5:

{{quote|No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.}}

==Income taxes before the ''Pollock'' case==

Until 1913, [[Duty (economics)|customs duties]] (tariffs) and [[excise]] taxes were the primary sources of federal revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Buenker, John D. 1981. "The Ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment." ''The Cato Journal''. 1:1. [https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/1981/5/cj1n1-10.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; During the War of 1812, Secretary of the Treasury [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander J. Dallas]] made the first public proposal for an income tax, but it was never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Baack, Bennet T. and Edward John Ray. 1985. "Special Interests and the Adoption of the Income Tax in the United States." ''The Journal of Economic History'' V. 45, No. 3. pp. 607-625.&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress did introduce an income tax to fund the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] through the [[Revenue Act of 1861]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/July-August-08/On-this-Day--Congress-Enacts-First-Income-Tax.html|title=On This Day: Congress Passes Act Creating First Income Tax|publisher=Findingdulcinea.com|accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It levied a [[flat tax]] of three percent on annual income above $800. This act was replaced the following year with the [[Revenue Act of 1862]], which levied a [[Progressive tax|graduated tax]] of three to five percent on income above $600 and specified a termination of income taxation in 1866. The Civil War income taxes, which expired in 1872, proved to be both highly lucrative and drawing mostly from the more industrialized states, with [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Massachusetts]] generating about 60 percent of the total revenue that was collected.&lt;ref name="Baack and Ray, p. 608"&gt;Baack and Ray, p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt; During the two decades following the expiration of the Civil War income tax, the Greenback movement, the Labor Reform Party, the Populist Party, the Democratic Party and many others called for a graduated income tax.&lt;ref name="Baack and Ray, p. 608"/&gt;

The [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]] advocated a graduated income tax in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slp.org/pdf/platforms/plat1887.pdf|title=Socialist Labor Party Platform|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] "demand[ed] a graduated income tax" in its 1892 platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5361|title=Populist Party Platform, 1892|publisher=Historymatters.gmu.edu|accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic Party, led by [[William Jennings Bryan]], advocated the income tax law passed in 1894,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WORfl6qe2ewC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=%22point+of+attack+is+the+income+tax%22|title=Speeches of William Jennings Bryan, pp. 159-179|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2012-03-26|year=1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed an income tax in its 1908 platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showplatforms.php?platindex=D1908 1908 Democratic party platform] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113115038/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showplatforms.php?platindex=D1908 |date=January 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.]]'', all income taxes had been considered to be indirect taxes imposed without respect to geography, unlike direct taxes, that have to be apportioned among the states according to population.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary, James W. Ely, Jr., on the case of ''Springer v. United States'', in answers.com, at [http://www.answers.com/topic/springer-v-united-states]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Again the situation is aptly illustrated by the various acts taxing incomes derived from property of every kind and nature which were enacted beginning in 1861, and lasting during what may be termed the Civil War period. It is not disputable that these latter tax laws were classed under the head of excises, duties, and imposts because it was assumed that they were of that character, although putting a tax burden on income of every kind, including that derived from property real or personal, since they were not taxes directly on property because of its ownership." ''Brushaber v. Union Pac. Railroad'', {{ussc|240|1|1916}}, at 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Pollock'' case==

In 1894, an amendment was attached to the [[Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act]] that attempted to impose a federal tax of two percent on incomes over $4,000 (equal to ${{Inflation|US|4|1894|r=0}},000 in {{Inflation-year|US}}).{{Inflation-fn|US}} The federal income tax was strongly favored in the South, and it was moderately supported in the eastern North Central states, but it was strongly opposed in the Far West and the Northeastern States (with the exception of [[New Jersey]]).&lt;ref&gt;Baack and Ray, p. 610&lt;/ref&gt; The tax was derided as "un-Democratic, inquisitorial, and wrong in principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. Cockran's Final Effort|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/01/31/104107025.pdf|work=New York Times|date=1894-01-31|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] declared certain taxes on incomes – such as those on property under the 1894 Act – to be [[Constitutionality|unconstitutionally]] unapportioned [[direct tax]]es. The Court reasoned that a tax on ''income from property'' should be treated as a tax on "property by reason of its ownership" and so should be required to be apportioned. The reasoning was that taxes on the rents from land, the dividends from stocks, and so forth, burdened the property generating the income in the same way that a tax on "property by reason of its ownership" burdened that property.

After ''Pollock'', while income taxes on wages (as indirect taxes) were still not required to be apportioned by population, taxes on interest, dividends, and rental income were required to be apportioned by population. The ''Pollock'' ruling made the ''source of the income'' (e.g., property versus labor, etc.) relevant in determining whether the tax imposed on that income was deemed to be "direct" (and thus required to be apportioned among the states according to population) or, alternatively, "indirect" (and thus required only to be imposed with geographical uniformity).&lt;ref&gt;Read a description of the decision at the [http://www.tax.org/Museum/1866-1900.htm Tax History Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814151715/http://www.tax.org/museum/1866-1900.htm |date=2010-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissenting in ''Pollock'', Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] stated:

{{quote|When, therefore, this court adjudges, as it does now adjudge, that Congress cannot impose a duty or tax upon personal property, or upon income arising either from rents of real estate or from personal property, including invested personal property, bonds, stocks, and investments of all kinds, except by apportioning the sum to be so raised among the States according to population, it practically decides that, without an amendment of the Constitution – two-thirds of both Houses of Congress and three-fourths of the States concurring – such property and incomes can never be made to contribute to the support of the national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0158_0601_ZD.html|title=Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion in ''Pollock''|publisher=Law.cornell.edu|accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Members of Congress responded to ''Pollock'' by expressing widespread concern that many of the wealthiest Americans had consolidated too much economic power.&lt;ref&gt;See the quotes from Theodore Roosevelt at the [http://www.tax.org/Museum/1901-1932.htm Tax History Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814150842/http://www.tax.org/museum/1901-1932.htm |date=2010-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
On June 16, 1909, President [[William Howard Taft]], in an address to the [[61st United States Congress|Sixty-first Congress]], proposed a two percent federal [[income tax]] on [[corporation]]s by way of an [[excise tax]] and a constitutional amendment to allow the previously enacted income tax.{{quote|Upon the privilege of doing business as an artificial entity and of freedom from a general partnership liability enjoyed by those who own the stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/print.php?pid=68517|title=Taft Address of June 16, 1909 (American Presidency Project)|publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu|date=1909-06-16|accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Sm9aaKTgAWsC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;vq=june+16+1909+%22income+tax%22&amp;dq=june+16+1909+%22income+tax%22|title=President Taft Presidential addresses|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2012-03-26|year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An income tax amendment to the Constitution was first proposed by Senator [[Norris Brown]] of [[Nebraska]]. He submitted two proposals, Senate Resolutions Nos. 25 and 39. The amendment proposal finally accepted was Senate Joint Resolution No. 40, introduced by Senator [[Nelson W. Aldrich]] of [[Rhode Island]], the Senate majority leader and [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]] Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Volume 36, Statutes at Large, 61st Congress Session I, Senate Joint Resolution No. 40, p. 184, approved July 31, 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 1909, the resolution proposing the Sixteenth Amendment was passed by the Congress&lt;ref&gt;Senate Joint Resolution 40, 36 Stat. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and was submitted to the state legislatures. Support for the income tax was strongest in the western and southern states, while opposition was strongest in the northeastern states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj1n1/cj1n1-10.pdf|title=The Ratification of the Federal Income Tax Amendment, John D. Buenker|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-03-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114120602/http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj1n1/cj1n1-10.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the income tax believed that it would be a much better method of gathering revenue than tariffs, which were the primary source of revenue at the time. From well before 1894, Democrats, Progressives, Populists and other left-oriented parties argued that tariffs disproportionately affected the poor, interfered with prices, were unpredictable, and were an intrinsically limited source of revenue. The South and the West tended to support income taxes because their residents were generally less prosperous, more agricultural and more sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. A sharp rise in the cost of living between 1897 and 1913 greatly increased support for the idea of income taxes, including in the urban Northeast.&lt;ref&gt;Buenker, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of Republicans also began supporting the idea, notably Theodore Roosevelt and the "Insurgent" Republicans (who would go on to form the Progressive Party).&lt;ref&gt;Buenker, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; These Republicans were driven mainly by a fear of the increasingly large and sophisticated military forces of Japan, Britain and the European powers, their own imperial ambitions and the perceived need to defend American merchant ships.&lt;ref&gt;Baack and Jay, p. 613-614&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these progressive Republicans were, as the name suggests, convinced that central governments could play a positive role in national economies.&lt;ref&gt;Buenker, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; A bigger government and a bigger military, of course, required a correspondingly larger and steadier source of revenue to support it.

Opposition to the Sixteenth Amendment was led by establishment Republicans because of their close ties to wealthy industrialists, although not even they were uniformly opposed to the general idea of a permanent income tax. In 1910, [[List of Governors of New York|New York Governor]] [[Charles Evans Hughes]], shortly before becoming a Supreme Court Justice, spoke out against the income tax amendment. Hughes supported the idea of a federal income tax, but believed the words "from whatever source derived" in the proposed amendment implied that the federal government would have the power to tax state and municipal bonds. He believed this would excessively centralize governmental power and "would make it impossible for the state to keep any property".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj1n1/cj1n1-9.pdf|title=Arthur A.

Between 1909 and 1913, several conditions favored passage of the Sixteenth Amendment. Inflation was high and many blamed federal tariffs for the rising prices. The Republican Party was divided and weakened by the loss of Roosevelt and the Insurgents who joined the Progressive Party, a problem that blunted opposition even in the Northeast.&lt;ref&gt;Buenker, pp. 219-221&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the Democrats won the presidency and control of both houses of Congress. The country was generally in a left-leaning mood, with the Socialist Party winning a seat in the House in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1910|1910]] and polling six percent of the popular presidential vote in [[1912 presidential campaign|1912]].

Three advocates for a federal income tax ran in the [[United States presidential election, 1912|presidential election of 1912]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Young, "[https://www.mises.org/story/1597 The Origin of the Income Tax]", Ludwig von Mises Institute, Sept. 7, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On February 25, 1913, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Philander C.

According to the [[United States Government Publishing Office]], the following states ratified the amendment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/constamrat.html|title=Ratification of Constitutional Amendments|publisher=U.S. Constitution Online|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Pollock'' overruled==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=November 2017}}
The Sixteenth Amendment removed the precedent set by the ''Pollock'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Bittker]], "Constitutional Limits on the Taxing Power of the Federal Government," ''The Tax Lawyer'', Fall 1987, Vol. 41, No. 1, p. 3 ([[American Bar Association]]) (''Pollock'' case "was in effect reversed by the sixteenth amendment")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution overruled Pollock ..." ''Graf v. Commissioner'', 44 T.C.M. (CCH) 66, TC Memo. 1982-317, CCH Dec. 39,080(M) (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Sheldon D. Pollack at the University of Delaware wrote:

{{quote|On February 25, 1913, in the closing days of the Taft administration, Secretary of State Philander C. Knox, a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania and attorney general under McKinley and Roosevelt, certified that the amendment had been properly ratified by the requisite number of state legislatures. Three more states ratified the amendment soon after, and eventually the total reached 42. The remaining six states either rejected the amendment or took no action at all. Notwithstanding the many frivolous claims repeatedly advanced by so-called tax protestors, the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution was duly ratified as of February 3, 1913. With that, the ''Pollock'' decision was overturned, restoring the ''status quo ante''. Congress once again had the "power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration".&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon D. Pollack, "Origins of the Modern Income Tax, 1894-1913," 66 ''Tax Lawyer'' 295, 323-324, Winter 2013 (Amer. Bar Ass'n) (footnotes omitted; italics in original).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From William D. Andrews, Professor of Law, Harvard Law School:

{{quote|In 1913 the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution was adopted, overruling ''Pollock'', and the Congress then levied an income tax on both corporate and individual incomes.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Andrews, ''Basic Federal Income Taxation'', p. 2, Little, Brown and Company (3d ed. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From Professor Boris Bittker, who was a tax law professor at Yale Law School:

{{quote|As construed by the Supreme Court in the Brushaber case, the power of Congress to tax income derives from Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, of the original Constitution rather than from the Sixteenth Amendment; the latter simply '''eliminated''' the requirement that an '''income tax, to the extent that it is a direct tax''', must be apportioned among the states. A corollary of this conclusion is that any direct tax that is not imposed on "income" remains subject to the rule of apportionment. Because the Sixteenth Amendment does not purport to define the term "direct tax," the scope of that constitutional phrase remains as debatable as it was before 1913; but the practical significance of the issue was greatly reduced once '''income taxes, even if direct''', were relieved from the requirement of apportionment.&lt;ref&gt;Boris I. Bittker, Martin J. McMahon, Jr. and Lawrence A. Zelenak, ''Federal Income Taxation of Individuals'' (2d ed. 2006) (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Professor Erik Jensen at Case Western Reserve University Law School has written:

{{quote|[The Sixteenth Amendment] was a response to the Income Tax Cases (Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.), and it exempts only "taxes on incomes" from the apportionment rule that otherwise applies to direct taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Erik M. Jensen, "The Taxing Power, The Sixteenth Amendment, And the Meaning of 'Incomes'", Oct. 4, 2002, ''Tax Analysts'' (footnotes not reproduced).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Professor Calvin H. Johnson, a tax professor at the University of Texas School of Law, has written:

{{quote|The Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1913, was written to allow Congress to tax income without the hobbling apportionment requirement.

...

Pollock was itself overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment as to apportionment of income ...&lt;ref&gt;Calvin H. Johnson, "Purging Out Pollock: The Constitutionality of Federal Wealth or Sales Tax", Dec. 27, 2002, ''Tax Analysts''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From Gale Ann Norton:

{{quote|Courts have essentially abandoned the permissive interpretation created in Pollock. Subsequent cases have viewed the Sixteenth Amendment as a rejection of Pollock's definition of "direct tax". The apportionment requirement again applies only to real estate and capitation taxes. Even if the Sixteenth Amendment is not viewed as narrowing the definition of direct taxes, it at least introduces an additional consideration to analysis under the Apportionment Clause. For the Court to strike an unapportioned tax, plaintiffs must establish not only that a tax is a direct tax, but also that it is not in the subset of direct taxes known as an income tax.&lt;ref&gt;Gale Ann Norton, "The Limitless Federal Taxing Power," Vol. 8 ''Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy'' 591 (Summer, 1985) (footnotes omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From Alan O. Dixler:

{{quote|In Brushaber, the Supreme Court validated the first post - 16th Amendment income tax. Chief Justice White, who as an associate justice had dissented articulately in Pollock, wrote for a unanimous Court. Upholding the income tax provisions of the tariff act of October 3, 1913, Chief Justice White observed that the 16th Amendment did not give Congress any new power to lay and collect an income tax; rather, the 16th Amendment permitted Congress to do so without apportionment ...&lt;ref&gt;Alan O. Dixler, "Direct Taxes Under the Constitution: A Review of the Precedents", Nov. 20, 2006, ''Tax Analysts''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Congress may impose taxes on income from any source without having to apportion the total dollar amount of tax collected from each state according to each state's population in relation to the total national population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment16/01.html#2|title=Findlaw: Sixteenth Amendment, History and Purpose of the Amendment|publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com|accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Wikoff v. Commissioner'', the [[United States Tax Court]] said:

{{quote|[I]t is immaterial, with respect to Federal income taxes, whether the tax is a direct or an indirect tax. Mr. Wikoff [the taxpayer] relied on the Supreme Court's decision in Pollock v.

Memo. 1978-372 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Abrams v. Commissioner'', the Tax Court said:

{{quote|Since the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, it is immaterial with respect to income taxes, whether the tax is a direct or indirect tax.

==Case law==

The federal courts' interpretations of the Sixteenth Amendment have changed considerably over time and there have been many disputes about the applicability of the amendment.

===The ''Brushaber'' case===

In ''[[Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad]]'', {{ussc|240|1|1916}}, the Supreme Court ruled that (1) the Sixteenth Amendment removes the ''Pollock'' requirement that certain income taxes (such as taxes on income "derived from real property" that were the subject of the ''Pollock'' decision), be apportioned among the states according to population;&lt;ref&gt;"As construed by the Supreme Court in the ''Brushaber'' case, the power of Congress to tax income derives from Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the Constitution, rather than from the Sixteenth Amendment; the latter simply eliminated the requirement that an income tax, to the extent that it is a direct tax, must be apportioned among the states." [[Boris Bittker|Boris I. Bittker]], Martin J. McMahon, Jr. &amp; Lawrence A. Zelenak, ''Federal Income Taxation of Individuals'', ch. 1, paragr. 1.01[1] [a], Research Institute of America (2d ed. 2005), as retrieved from 2002 WL 1454829 (W. G. &amp; L.).&lt;/ref&gt; (2) the federal income tax statute does not violate the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against the government taking property without due process of law; (3) the federal income tax statute does not violate the Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 requirement that excises, also known as indirect taxes, be imposed with geographical uniformity.

===The ''Kerbaugh-Empire Co''. case===

In ''[[Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co.]]'', {{ussc|271|170|1926}}, the Supreme Court, through [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Justice Pierce Butler]], stated:{{quote|It was not the purpose or the effect of that amendment to bring any new subject within the taxing power. Congress already had the power to tax all incomes. But taxes on incomes from some sources had been held to be "direct taxes" within the meaning of the constitutional requirement as to apportionment. [citations omitted] The Amendment relieved from that requirement and obliterated the distinction in that respect between taxes on income that are direct taxes and those that are not, and so put on the same basis all incomes "from whatever source derived". [citations omitted] "Income" has been taken to mean the same thing as used in the Corporation Excise Tax of 1909 (36 Stat. 112), in the Sixteenth Amendment, and in the various revenue acts subsequently passed. [citations omitted] After full consideration, this court declared that income may be defined as gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined, including profit gained through sale or conversion of capital.}}

===The ''Glenshaw Glass'' case===

In ''[[Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.]]'', {{ussc|348|426|1955}}, the Supreme Court laid out what has become the modern understanding of what constitutes "gross income" to which the Sixteenth Amendment applies, declaring that income taxes could be levied on "accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion". Under this definition, ''any'' increase in wealth – whether through [[wage]]s, benefits, bonuses, sale of stock or other property at a profit, bets won, lucky finds, awards of [[punitive damages]] in a lawsuit, [[qui tam]] actions – are all within the definition of income, unless the [[United States Congress|Congress]] makes a specific exemption, as it has for items such as [[life insurance]] proceeds received by reason of the death of the insured party,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[gift]]s, [[bequest]]s, devises and inheritances,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and certain [[scholarship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|117}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Income taxation of wages, etc.===
Federal courts have ruled that the Sixteenth Amendment allows a direct tax on "wages, salaries, commissions, etc. without apportionment".&lt;ref&gt;''Parker v. Commissioner'', 724 F.2d 469, 84-1 U.S. Tax Cas. ([[CCH (company)|CCH]]) ¶ 9209 (5th Cir. 1984) (closing parenthesis in original has been omitted). For other court decisions upholding the taxability of wages, salaries, etc. see ''United States v. Connor'', 898 F.2d 942, 90-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,166 (3d Cir. 1990); ''Perkins v. Commissioner'', 746 F.2d 1187, 84-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9898 (6th Cir. 1984); ''White v. United States'', 2005-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,289 (6th Cir. 2004), ''cert. denied'', ____ U.S. ____ (2005); ''Granzow v. Commissioner'', 739 F.2d 265, 84-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9660 (7th Cir. 1984); ''Waters v. Commissioner'', 764 F.2d 1389, 85-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9512 (11th Cir. 1985); ''United States v. Buras'', 633 F.2d 1356, 81-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9126 (9th Cir. 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Penn Mutual'' case===

Although the Sixteenth Amendment is often cited as the "source" of the congressional power to tax incomes, at least one court has reiterated the point made in ''Brushaber'' and other cases that the Sixteenth Amendment itself did not grant the Congress the power to tax incomes, a power the Congress had since 1789, but only removed the possible requirement that any income tax be apportioned among the states according to their respective populations. In ''Penn Mutual Indemnity'', the [[United States Tax Court]] stated:&lt;ref&gt;''Penn Mutual Indemnity Co. v. Commissioner'', 32 T.C. 653 at 659 (1959), ''aff'd'', 277 F.2d 16, 60-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9389 (3d Cir. 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In dealing with the scope of the taxing power the question has sometimes been framed in terms of whether something can be taxed as income under the Sixteenth Amendment. This is an inaccurate formulation ... and has led to much loose thinking on the subject. The source of the taxing power is not the Sixteenth Amendment; it is [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Enumerated powers|Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution]].}}

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] agreed with the Tax Court, stating:&lt;ref&gt;''Penn Mutual Indemnity Co. v. Commissioner'', 277 F.2d 16, 60-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶. 9389 (3d Cir. 1960) (footnotes omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
It did not take a constitutional amendment to entitle the United States to impose an income tax. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429, 158 U. S. 601 (1895), only held that a tax on the income derived from real or personal property was so close to a tax on that property that it could not be imposed without apportionment. The Sixteenth Amendment removed that barrier. Indeed, the requirement for apportionment is pretty strictly limited to taxes on real and personal property and capitation taxes.

It is not necessary to uphold the validity of the tax imposed by the United States that the tax itself bear an accurate label. Indeed, the tax upon the distillation of spirits, imposed very early by federal authority, now reads and has read in terms of a tax upon the spirits themselves, yet the validity of this imposition has been upheld for a very great many years.

It could well be argued that the tax involved here [an income tax] is an "excise tax" based upon the receipt of money by the taxpayer. It certainly is not a tax on property and it certainly is not a capitation tax; therefore, it need not be apportioned. We do not think it profitable, however, to make the label as precise as that required under the Food and Drug Act. Congress has the power to impose taxes generally, and if the particular imposition does not run afoul of any constitutional restrictions then the tax is lawful, call it what you will.}}

===The ''Murphy'' case===

On December 22, 2006, a three-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] [[Vacated judgment|vacated]]&lt;ref&gt;Order, Dec. 22, 2006, the ruling of ''Murphy v. Internal Revenue Service and United States'', U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; its unanimous decision (of August 2006) in ''[[Murphy v. IRS|Murphy v. Internal Revenue Service and United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;460 F.3d 79, 2006-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,476, 2006 WL 2411372 (D.C. Cir. August 22, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In an unrelated matter, the court had also granted the government's motion to dismiss Murphy's suit against the Internal Revenue Service. Under [[Sovereign immunity in the United States#Federal sovereign immunity|federal sovereign immunity]], a taxpayer may sue the federal government, but not a government agency, officer, or employee (with some exceptions). The Court ruled:

{{quote|Insofar as the Congress has waived sovereign immunity with respect to suits for tax refunds under {{uscsub|28|1346|a|1}}, that provision specifically contemplates only actions against the "United States". Therefore, we hold the IRS, unlike the United States, may not be sued ''[[eo nomine]]'' in this case.}}

An exception to federal sovereign immunity is in the [[United States Tax Court]], in which a taxpayer may sue the [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]].&lt;ref&gt;([http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200608/05-5139a.pdf ''Murphy v. United States''])&lt;/ref&gt; The original three-judge panel then agreed to rehear the case itself. In its original decision, the Court had ruled that {{uscsub|26|104|a|2}} was unconstitutional under the Sixteenth Amendment to the extent that the statute purported to tax, as income, a recovery for a nonphysical personal injury for mental distress and loss of reputation not received in lieu of taxable income such as lost wages or earnings.

Because the August 2006 opinion was vacated, the Court of Appeals did not hear the case ''[[en banc]]''.

On July 3, 2007, the Court (through the original three-judge panel) ruled (1) that the taxpayer's compensation was received on account of a nonphysical injury or sickness; (2) that gross income under section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|61}} ([http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200707/05-5139b.pdf ''Murphy v United States, on rehearing''])&lt;/ref&gt; does include compensatory damages for nonphysical injuries, even if the award is not an "accession to wealth", (3) that the income tax imposed on an award for nonphysical injuries is an indirect tax, regardless of whether the recovery is restoration of "human capital", and therefore the tax does not violate the constitutional requirement of [[Denied powers|Article I, Section 9, Clause 4]], that [[Tax per head|capitations]] or other [[direct tax]]es must be laid among the states only in proportion to the population; (4) that the income tax imposed on an award for nonphysical injuries does not violate the constitutional requirement of [[Taxing and Spending Clause|Article I, Section 8, Clause 1]], that all [[Customs duty|duties]], [[Tax#tariff|imposts]] and [[excise]]s be uniform throughout the United States; (5) that under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the Internal Revenue Service may not be sued in its own name.&lt;ref&gt;Opinion on rehearing, July 3, 2007, ''Murphy v. Internal Revenue Service and United States'', case no. 05-5139, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 2007-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,531 (D.C. Cir. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court stated that "[a]lthough the 'Congress cannot make a thing income which is not so in fact', ... it can ''label'' a thing income and tax it, so long as it acts within its constitutional authority, which includes not only the Sixteenth Amendment but also Article I, Sections 8 and 9."&lt;ref&gt;Opinion on rehearing, July 3, 2007, p. 16, ''Murphy v. Internal Revenue Service and United States'', case no. 05-5139, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 2007-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,531 (D.C. Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled that Ms. Murphy was not entitled to the tax refund she claimed, and that the personal injury award she received was "within the reach of the Congressional power to tax under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution" – even if the award was "not income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment".&lt;ref&gt;Opinion on rehearing, July 3, 2007, p. 5-6, ''Murphy v. Internal Revenue Service and United States'', case no. 05-5139, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 2007-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,531 (D.C. Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; See also the ''Penn Mutual'' case cited above.

On April 21, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the decision by the Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2008/04/court-to-hear-anti-dumping-case/|title=Court to hear anti-dumping, sentencing cases|last=Denniston|first=Lyle|date=April 21, 2008|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=21 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{UStaxation}}
Taxes under '''State Unemployment Tax Act''' (or '''SUTA''') are those designed to finance the cost of state [[Unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance benefits]] in the [[United States]], which make up all of unemployment insurance expenditures in normal times, and the majority of unemployment insurance expenditures during [[Recession|downturns]], with the remainder paid in part by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] for "emergency" benefit extensions.

The [[tax]] is unique in two primary aspects. First, the tax is [[Experience rating|experience rated]] which means that tax rates are firm-specific and the rate a firm faces updates each year to reflect the cost of the benefits that firm's former employees have received recently. Because it is primarily firms in stress that generate [[Layoff|layoffs]], these tax increases target firms that are already under strain. For this reason, states limit how high they allow taxes to rise, but these limits vary by almost an order of magnitude from state to state.

The second unique feature of [[Unemployment insurance|UI]] taxes under SUTA is that the taxable base is ~$10,000 (on average, varies by state) per employee, much less than the average yearly earnings of a given worker. Because of this feature, firms pay a fixed "lump sum" tax per worker they employ. This provides a modest incentive for firms to reduce unskilled and part-time work in favor of skilled and full-time work.

One interesting feature of the UI tax is that it targets firms that have recently had layoffs, potentially hitting distressed firms. Recent work shows that UI tax increases significantly reduce hiring and employment in affected firms, potentially eroding the [[macroeconomics]] stabilizing influence of the UI program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unemployment Insurance Taxes and Labor Demand: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Administrative Data |work=SSRN Repository |publisher=Working Paper |url= https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3062412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Basic Forms of government}}

'''Theocracy''' is a form of government in which a religious institution is the source from which all authority derives. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has this definition:
{{quote|1. a system of government in which priests rule in the name of God or a god.
1.1. the commonwealth of Israel from the time of Moses until the election of Saul as King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theocracy|title=Theocracy; Dictionary&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher= Merriam-webster.com |year=2015 |accessdate= 2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/theocracy Theocracy, n.]" in ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2015); Retrieved 28 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An '''ecclesiocracy''' is a situation where the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation: for example, the [[prince-bishop]]s of the [[European Middle Ages]], where the bishop was also the temporal ruler. Such a state may use the administrative hierarchy of the religion for its own administration, or it may have two "arms"—administrators and clergy—but with the state administrative hierarchy subordinate to the religious hierarchy. Theocracy differs from [[theonomy]], the latter of which is government based on [[divine law]].&lt;ref name="Neuhaus1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Neuhaus|first=Richard John|title=The Naked Public Square: Religion and Democracy in America|year=1986|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|language=English|isbn=9780802800800|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The papacy in the [[Papal States]] occupied a middle ground between theocracy and ecclesiocracy, since the Pope did not claim he was a prophet who received revelation from God and translated it into civil law.

Religiously endorsed monarchies fall between theocracy and ecclesiocracy, according to the relative strengths of the religious and political organs.

Most forms of theocracy are [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] in nature, involving rule of the many by the few, some of whom so anointed under claim of divine commission.

==Etymology==
The word ''theocracy'' originates from the Greek θεοκρατία meaning "the rule of God". This in turn derives from [[:wikt:θεός|θεός]] (''theos''), meaning "god", and [[:wikt:κρατέω|κρατέω]] (''krateo''), meaning "to rule". Thus the meaning of the word in Greek was "rule by god(s)" or human incarnation(s) of god(s).

The term was initially coined by [[Flavius Josephus]] in the first century A.D. to describe the characteristic government of the [[Jew]]s. Josephus argued that while mankind had developed many forms of rule, most could be subsumed under the following  three types: monarchy, [[oligarchy]], and democracy. The government of the Jews, however, was unique. Josephus offered the term "theocracy" to describe this polity, ordained by Moses, in which God is sovereign and his word is law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2849/2849-h/2849-h.htm|title=Against Apion by Flavius Josephus,  Book II, Chapter 17|work=gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephus' definition was widely accepted until the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era, when the term started to collect more universalistic{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} and negative [[connotation]]s, especially in [[Hegel]]'s hands. The first recorded English use was in 1622, with the meaning "sacerdotal government under divine inspiration" (as in Biblical Israel before the rise of kings); the meaning "priestly or religious body wielding political and civil power" is recorded from 1825.

==Synopsis==
{{tone|section|date=December 2016}}
In some religions, the ruler, usually a king, was regarded as the chosen favorite of God (or gods) who could not be questioned, sometimes even being the descendant of, or a god in their own right. Today, there is also a form of government where clerics have the power and the supreme leader could not be questioned in action. From the perspective of the theocratic government, "God himself is recognized as the head" of the state,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14568a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia] "A form of civil government in which God himself is recognized as the head."&lt;/ref&gt; hence the term ''theocracy'', from the [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|θεοκρατία}} "rule of God", a term used by [[Josephus]] for the [[kingdoms of Israel and Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;English form the 17th century (''[[OED]]'').
The Greek term is explicitly coined by Josephus and isn't attested elsewhere in Ancient Greek; Josephus marks it as a [[nonce word|nonce]] coinage by calling it a "strained expression".
W. Whiston tr. [[Josephus]], ''Against Apion'' ii. §17 (1814) IV. 340: "He [Moses] ordained our government to be what, by a strained expression, may be termed a Theocracy", translating  {{lang|grc|ὡς δ'ἄν τίς εἴποι, βιασάμενος τὸν λόγον, θεοκρατίαν}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Taken literally, ''theocracy'' means rule by God or gods and refers primarily to an internal "rule of the heart", especially in its biblical application. The common, generic use of the term, as defined above in terms of rule by a church or analogous religious leadership, would be more accurately described as an ''ecclesiocracy''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/bth ''Biblical Theocracy: A vision of the biblical foundations for a Christian political philosophy''] (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1993), introduced these more precise uses of the terms in arguing that theocracy (in this pure sense) is the only political system defended in the Bible. While Palmquist defends theocracy in this pure form as a viable (though "non-political") political system, he warns that what normally goes by this name is actually ecclesiocracy, the most dangerous of all political systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pure theocracy, the civil leader is believed to have a personal connection with the civilization's religion or belief. For example, [[Moses]] led the Israelites, and [[Muhammad]] led the early Muslims. There is a fine line between the tendency of appointing religious characters to run the state and having a religious-based government. According to the Holy Books, Prophet Joseph was offered an essential governmental role just because he was trustworthy, wise and knowledgeable (Quran 12: 54–55). As a result of the Prophet Joseph's knowledge and also due to his ethical and genuine efforts during a critical economic situation, the whole nation was rescued from a seven-year drought (Quran 12: 47–48).

When religions have a "holy book", it is used as a direct message from God. Law proclaimed by the ruler is also considered a divine revelation, and hence the law of God. As to the Prophet Muhammad ruling, "The first thirteen of the Prophet's twenty-three year career went on totally apolitical and non-violent. This attitude partly changed only after he had to flee from Mecca to Medina.This ''hijra'', or migration, would be a turning point in the Prophet's mission and would mark the very beginning of the Muslim calendar. Yet the Prophet did not establish a theocracy in Medina. Instead of a polity defined solely by Islam, he founded a territorial polity based on religious pluralism. This is evident in a document called the ’[[Constitution of Medina|Charter of Medina]]’, which the Prophet signed with the leaders of the other community in the city."&lt;ref&gt;Akyol, Mustafa. ''Islam without extremes'' W.W.Norton, 2013, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Quran, Prophets were not after power or material resources. For example in surah 26 verses (109, 127, 145, 164, 180), the Koran repeatedly quotes from Prophets, [[Noah]], [[Hud (prophet)|Hud]], [[Salih]], [[Lut]], and [[Shu'aib]] that: "I do not ask you for it any payment; my payment is only from the Lord of the worlds." While, in theocracy many aspects of the holy book are overshadowed by material powers. Due to be considered divine, the regime entitles itself to interpret verses to its own benefit and abuse them out of the context for its political aims. An ecclesiocracy, on the other hand, is a situation where the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation.  For example, the [[prince-bishop]]s of the European Middle Ages, where the bishop was also the temporal ruler. Such a state may use the administrative hierarchy of the religion for its own administration, or it may have two "arms"—administrators and clergy—but with the state administrative hierarchy subordinate to the religious hierarchy. The papacy in the [[Papal States]] occupied a middle ground between theocracy and ecclesiocracy, since the pope did not claim he was a prophet who received revelation from God and translated it into civil law.

Religiously endorsed monarchies fall between these two poles, according to the relative strengths of the religious and political organs.

Theocracy is distinguished from other, secular forms of government that have a [[state religion]], or are influenced by theological or moral concepts, and monarchies held "[[By the Grace of God]]". In the most common usage of the term, some civil rulers are leaders of the dominant religion (e.g., the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor as patron and defender of the official Church); the government proclaims it rules on behalf of God or a higher power, as specified by the local religion, and divine approval of government institutions and laws. These characteristics apply also to a [[Caesaropapism|caesaropapist]] regime. The Byzantine Empire however was not theocratic since the patriarch answered to the emperor, not vice versa; similarly in Tudor England the crown forced the church to break away from Rome so the royal (and, especially later, parliamentary) power could assume full control of the now [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] hierarchy and confiscate most church property and income.

Secular governments can also co-exist with a state religion or delegate some aspects of civil law to religious communities. For example, in [[Israel]] marriage is governed by officially recognized religious bodies who each provide marriage services for their respected adherents, yet no form of civil marriage (free of religion, for atheists, for example) exists nor marriage by non-recognized minority religions.

They are usually clerics, appointed as Ordinaries, but in the past have also included men who were not bishops nor clerics.&lt;ref name="wfbvat"/&gt; A pope is elected for life, and either dies or may resign.

====Mount Athos (Athonite State)====
{{Main|Mount Athos}}
Mount Athos is a mountain peninsula in Greece which is an Eastern Orthodox autonomous region consisting of 20 [[monasteries]] under the direct jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]. There has been almost 1,800-years of continuous Christian presence on Mount Athos and it has a long history of monastic traditions, which dates back to at least 800 A.D. The origins of self-rule are originally from an edict by the Byzantine Emperor [[John Tzimisces|Ioannis Tzimisces]] in 972, which was later reaffirmed by the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in 1095. After Greece's independence from the Ottoman Empire, Greece claimed mount Athos but after a diplomatic dispute with Russia the region was formally recognised as Greek after World War 1.

Mount Athos is specifically exempt from the free movement of people and goods required by Greece's membership of the European Union&lt;ref&gt;Joint Declaration No. 5 attached to the Final Act of the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:42000A0922(06):EN:''not'' accession treaty].&lt;/ref&gt; and entrance is only allowed with express permission from the monks. The number of daily visitors to Mount Athos is restricted, with all visitors required to obtain an entrance permit. Only men are permitted to visit and Orthodox Christians take precedence in permit issuing. Residents of Mount Athos must be men aged 18 and over who are members of the Eastern Orthodox Church and also either monks or workers.

Athos is governed jointly by a 'Holy Community' consisting of representatives from the 20 monasteries and a Civil Governor, appointed by the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Holy Community also has a four-member executive committee called the 'Holy Administration' which is led by a [[Protos (monastic office)|Protos]].

The [[Guardian Council]], has the power to veto bills from [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|majlis]] (parliament), approve or disapprove candidates who wish to run for high office (president, majlis, the Assembly of Experts). The council supervises elections, and can greenlight or ban investigations into the election process.&lt;ref name="wfbiran"/&gt; Six of the Guardians (half the council) are faqih empowered to approve or veto all bills from the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|majlis]] (parliament) according to whether the faqih believe them to be in accordance with Islamic law and customs (''Sharia''). The other six members are lawyers appointed by the head of the judiciary (who is also a cleric and also appointed by the Leader).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/government/constitution-11.html Constitution of Iran], Article 157:

An [[Islamic republic]] is the name given to several states that are officially ruled by [[Islamic laws]], including the Islamic Republics of  [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Mauritania]]. Pakistan first adopted the title under the constitution of 1956. Mauritania adopted it on 28 November 1958. Iran adopted it after the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. Afghanistan adopted it in 2004 after the fall of the [[Taliban]] government. Despite having similar names the countries differ greatly in their governments and laws.

The term "Islamic republic" has come to mean several different things, some contradictory to others. To some Muslim religious leaders in the Middle East and Africa who advocate it, an Islamic republic is a [[Sovereign state|state]] under a particular [[Islam]]ic [[form of government]]. They see it as a compromise between a purely Islamic [[caliphate]] and secular nationalism and [[republicanism]]. In their conception of the Islamic republic, the [[penal code]] of the state is required to be compatible with some or all laws of [[Sharia]], and the state may not be a monarchy, as many Middle Eastern states are presently.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Central Tibetan Administration===
The [[Central Tibetan Administration]], colloquially known as the Tibetan government in exile, is a [[Tibetan exile]] organisation with a state-like internal structure. According to its charter, the position of head of state of the Central Tibetan Administration belongs ''ex officio'' to the current [[Dalai Lama]], a religious hierarch. In this respect, it continues the traditions of the [[Ganden Podrang|former government of Tibet]], which was ruled by the Dalai Lamas and their ministers, with a specific role reserved for a class of [[monk official]]s.

On March 14, 2011, at the [[14th Dalai Lama]]'s suggestion, the parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration began considering a proposal to remove the Dalai Lama's role as head of state in favor of an elected leader.

The first directly elected [[Kalon Tripa|Kalön Tripa]] was [[Samdhong Rinpoche]], who was elected August 20, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan Roebert, ''Samdhong Rinpoche: Uncompromising Truth for a Compromised World'' ([[World Wisdom]], 2006) {{ISBN|978-1-933316-20-8}} (On August 20, 2001, Venerable Professor Samdhong Rinpoche was elected Kalon Tripa (Prime Minister) of the Tibetan Government in Exile, receiving 84.5% of the popular exile vote.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2011, the [[Kalon Tripa|Kalön Tripa]] position was subordinate to the [[14th Dalai Lama]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/t100000_.html The Charter of Tibetans in-Exile], Article 20 of the [[Constitution of Tibet]], retrieved 2010-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; who presided over the government in exile from its founding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/t100000_.html The Charter of Tibetans in-Exile], Articles 19, 30, &amp; 31 of the Constitution of Tibet, retrieved 2010-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In August of that year, Lobsang Sangay polled 55 percent votes out of 49,189, defeating his nearest rival Tethong Tenzin Namgyal by 8,646 votes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/Lobsang-Sangay-chosen-for-political-work/article14699924.ece |title=Lobsang Sangay chosen for political work |website=The Hindu |access-date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the second popularly elected Kalon Tripa. The Dalai Lama announced that his political authority would be transferred to Sangay.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Nelson [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/tibet/8688087/Lobsang-Sangay-profile.html Lobsang Sangay: profile], The Telegraph, 08 Aug 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Change to Sikyong====
On September 20, 2012, the 15th Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile unanimously voted to change the title of Kalön Tripa to ''Sikyong'' in Article 19 of the Charter of the Tibetans in exile and relevant articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=32159&amp;t=1 Tibetan Parliament changes 'Kalon Tripa' to 'Sikyong']&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama had previously referred to the Kalon Tripa as Sikyong, and this usage was cited as the primary justification for the name change. According to ''Tibetan Review'', "Sikyong" translates to "political leader", as distinct from "spiritual leader".&lt;ref name="TR"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tibetanreview.net/news.php?id=11207|title=Kalon Tripa to be now referred to as Sikyong|date=2012-09-22|accessdate=2012-12-11|publisher=Tibetan Review|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017051755/http://www.tibetanreview.net/news.php?id=11207|archivedate=2013-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign affairs Kalon [[Dicki Chhoyang]] stated that the term "Sikyong" has had a precedent dating back to the [[7th Dalai Lama]], and that the name change "ensures historical continuity and legitimacy of the traditional leadership from the fifth Dalai Lama".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tibet.net/2012/11/16/international-support-groups-meet-in-dharamsala-to-deal-with-critical-situation-in-tibet/|title=International Support Groups Meet in Dharamsala to Deal with Critical Situation In Tibet|date=2012-11-16|publisher=Central Tibetan Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online Dharma Dictionary translates sikyong (''srid skyong'') as "secular ruler; regime, regent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/srid_skyong|title=srid skyong|work=tsadra.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title ''sikyong'' had previously been used by [[regent]]s who ruled Tibet during the Dalai Lama's minority.

===States with official state religion===

{{main|State religion}}
Having a state religion is not sufficient to be a theocracy in the narrow sense. Many countries have a state religion without the government directly deriving its powers from a divine authority or a religious authority directly exercising governmental powers. Since the narrow sense has few instances in the modern world, the more common usage is the wider sense of an enforced state religion.

==Historic states with theocratic aspects==

=== Ancient Egypt ===
The pharaoh was the offspring of the sungod.

=== Japan ===
The emperor was the offspring of the sungoddess.

===Western Antiquity===
{{further|Imperial cult|State church of the Roman Empire|Israelites}}

The [[imperial cult]]s in [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Roman Empire]], as well as numerous other monarchies, deified the ruling monarch. The state religion was often dedicated to the worship of the ruler as a deity, or the incarnation thereof.

[[Confederated Tribes of Israel|Early Israel]] was ruled by Judges before instituting a monarchy. The Judges were believed to be representatives of YHVH [[Yahweh]] (also translated as, [[Jehovah]]).

In ancient and medieval Christianity, [[Caesaropapism]] is the doctrine where a head of state is at the same time the head of the church.

===Tibet===
Unified religious rule in Tibet began in 1642, when the [[Fifth Dalai Lama]] allied with the military power of the Mongol [[Gushri Khan]] to consolidate the political power and center control around his office as head of the Gelug school.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{Cite book

This form of government is known as the [[dual system of government]]. Prior to 1642, particular monasteries and monks had held considerable power throughout Tibet, but had not achieved anything approaching complete control, though power continued to be held in a diffuse, feudal system after the ascension of the Fifth Dalai Lama.  Power in Tibet was held by a number of traditional elites, including members of the nobility, the heads of the major Buddhist sects (including their various [[tulku]]s), and various large and influential monastic communities.&lt;ref name="Lopez"&gt;{{Cite book

Political power was sometimes used by monastic leaders to suppress rival religious schools through the confiscation of property and direct violence.&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parenti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelparenti.org/Tibet.html |title=Friendly Feudalism – The Tibet Myth |publisher=Michaelparenti.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social mobility was somewhat possible through the attainment of a monastic education, or recognition as a reincarnated teacher, but such institutions were dominated by the traditional elites and governed by political intrigue.&lt;ref name="Lopez"/&gt;  Non-Buddhists in Tibet were members of an outcast underclass.&lt;ref name="Lopez"/&gt;

The [[Outer Mongolia (1911–1919)|Bogd Khaanate]] period of [[Mongolia]] (1911–19) is also cited as a former Buddhist theocracy.

===China===
{{further|Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Chinese emperor}}

Similar to the Roman Emperor, the [[Chinese sovereign]] was historically held to be the [[Son of Heaven]]. However, from the first historical Emperor on, this was largely ceremonial and tradition quickly established it as a posthumous dignity, like the Roman institution. The situation before [[Qin Shi Huang Di]] is less clear.

The [[Shang dynasty]] essentially functioned as a theocracy, declaring the ruling family the sons of heaven and calling the chief sky god [[Shangdi]] after a word for their deceased ancestors.&lt;ref name=wibla/&gt; After their overthrow by the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]], the royal clan of Shang were not eliminated but instead moved to a ceremonial capital where they were charged to continue the performance of their rituals.

The titles combined by [[Shi Huangdi]] to form his new title of [[Chinese emperor|emperor]] were originally applied to [[Three Sovereigns|god-like beings]] who ordered the heavens and earth and to [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|culture heroes]] credited with the invention of [[Five Grains|agriculture]], [[traditional Chinese clothing|clothing]], [[traditional Chinese music|music]], [[Chinese astrology|astrology]], &amp;c. Even after the fall of [[Qin dynasty|Qin]], an emperor's words were considered sacred edicts ({{lang|zh|聖旨}}) and his written proclamations "directives from above" ({{lang|zh|上諭}}).

As a result, some [[Sinologist]]s translate the title ''huangdi'' (usually rendered "[[emperor of China|emperor]]") as '''thearch'''. The term properly refers to the head of a thearchy (a kingdom of gods), but the more accurate "theocrat" carries associations of a strong priesthood that would be generally inaccurate in describing imperial China. Others reserve the use of "thearch" to describe the legendary figures of Chinese prehistory while continuing to use "emperor" to describe historical rulers.&lt;ref name=wibla&gt;Nadeau, Randall L. ''The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions'', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=bWwV2W14-30C&amp;pg=PA54 pp. 54 ff.] John Wiley &amp; Sons (Chichester), 2012. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9031-2}} Accessed 22 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace]] in 1860s [[Qing China]] was a heterodox Christian theocracy led by a person who said that he was the younger brother of [[Jesus Christ]], [[Hong Xiuquan]]. This theocratic state fought one of the most destructive wars in history, the [[Taiping Rebellion]], against the [[Qing dynasty]] for fifteen years before being crushed following the fall of the rebel capital [[Nanjing]].

===Caliphate===

{{Main|Caliphate}}

The Sunni branch of Islam stipulates that, as a head of state, a Caliph should be elected by Muslims or their representatives. Followers of Shia Islam, however, believe a Caliph should be an Imam chosen by God from the Ahl al-Bayt (the "Family of the House", Muhammad's direct descendants).

===Byzantine Empire===
{{main|Byzantine Empire#Religion}}
The [[Byzantine Empire]] ({{sm|a.d.}} 324–1453) operated under [[caesaropapism]], meaning that the [[List of Byzantine emperors|emperor]] was both the head of civil society and the ultimate authority over the ecclesiastical authorities, or [[patriarchates]]. The emperor was considered to be God's omnipotent representative on earth and he ruled as an absolute [[Autocracy|autocrat]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''The Byzantine Theocracy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Fretland VanVoorst argues, “the Byzantine Empire became a theocracy in the sense that Christian values and ideals were the foundation of the empire's political ideals and heavily entwined with its political goals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Fretland VanVoorst|title=The Byzantine Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyOoBQiCm88C&amp;pg=PA14|year=2012|publisher=Compass Point Books|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Steven Runciman]] says in his book on ''The Byzantine Theocracy'' (2004):
{{quote|The constitution of the Byzantine Empire was based on the conviction that it was the earthly copy of the Kingdom of Heaven. Just as God ruled in Heaven, so the Emperor, made in His image, should rule on earth and carry out his commandments....It saw itself as a universal empire. Ideally, it should embrace all the peoples of the Earth who, ideally, should all be members of the one true Christian Church, its own Orthodox Church. Just as man was made in God's image, so man's kingdom on Earth was made in the image of the Kingdom of Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''The Byzantine Theocracy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge Press, 2003; 1st printing 1977), 1–2, 162–63.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Geneva and Zurich===
Historians debate the extent to which Geneva, Switzerland,  in the days of [[John Calvin]] (1509–64) was a theocracy. On the one hand, Calvin's theology clearly called for separation between church and state. Other historians have stressed the enormous political power wielded on a daily basis by the clerics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark J. Larson|title=Calvin's Doctrine of the State: A Reformed Doctrine and Its American Trajectory, The Revolutionary War, and the Founding of the Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ItFLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|year=2009|publisher=Wipf and Stock |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harro Höpfl, ''The christian polity of John Calvin'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

In nearby [[Zurich]], Switzerland, Protestant reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]] (1484-1531) built a political system that many scholars have called a theocracy, while others have denied it.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Walton, ''Zwingli's Theocracy'' (Toronto University Press. 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deseret===
{{main|State of Deseret|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
{{see also|Theodemocracy}}
The question of theocracy has been debated at extensively by historians regarding the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon]] communities in Illinois, and especially in Utah.&lt;ref&gt;D. Michael Quinn,  "National Culture, Personality, and Theocracy in the Early Mormon Culture of Violence". ''The John Whitmer Historical Association Journal'' (2002): 159–86.

[[Joseph Smith]], mayor of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], and founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], ran as an independent for president in 1844. He proposed the redemption of slaves by selling public lands; reducing the size and salary of Congress; the closure of prisons; the [[annexation of Texas]], Oregon, and parts of Canada; the securing of international rights on high seas; [[free trade]]; and the re-establishment of a [[national bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Smith|first=Joseph Jr.|author-link=Joseph Smith|year=1844|title=General Smith's Views on the Powers and Policy of the Government of the United States|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/NCMP1820-1846,2597}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His top aide [[Brigham Young]] campaigned for Smith saying, "He it is that God of Heaven designs to save this nation from destruction and preserve the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth H. Winn|title=Exiles in a Land of Liberty: Mormons in America, 1830–1846|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESwIEefhOWwC&amp;pg=PA203|year=1990|page=203}}, quote on p 203&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign ended when Smith was [[Death of Joseph Smith|killed by a mob]] while in the Carthage, Illinois, jail on June 27, 1844.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carthage Jail]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After severe persecution, the Mormons left the United States and resettled in a remote part of Utah, which was then part of Mexico. However the United States took control in 1848 and would not accept polygamy. The Mormon [[State of Deseret]] was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/pioneers_and_cowboys/deseret.html ''Deseret''] utah.gov&lt;/ref&gt; Its original borders stretched from western [[Colorado]] to the [[southern California]] coast. When the Mormons arrived in the valley of the [[Great Salt Lake]] in 1847, the [[Great Basin]] was still a part of Mexico and had no secular government. As a result, [[Brigham Young]] administered the region both spiritually and temporally through the highly organized and centralized [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]]. This original organization was based upon a concept called [[theodemocracy]], a governmental system combining Biblical theocracy with mid-19th-century American political ideals.&lt;ref&gt;John G. Turner, ''Brigham Young: Pioneer Prophet'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Q. Mason, "God and the People: Theodemocracy in Nineteenth-Century Mormonism". ''Journal of Church and State'' (2011) {{doi|10.1093/jcs/csq135}} [https://webprod.uvu.edu/religiousstudies/docs/mormonamerican/mason_patrick_god_and_the_people_theodemocracy.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304235204/https://webprod.uvu.edu/religiousstudies/docs/mormonamerican/mason_patrick_god_and_the_people_theodemocracy.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1849, the Saints organized a secular government in Utah, although many ecclesiastical leaders maintained their positions of secular power. The Mormons also petitioned Congress to have Deseret admitted into the Union as a state. However, under the [[Compromise of 1850]], [[Utah Territory]] was created and Brigham Young was appointed governor. In this situation, Young still stood as head of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) as well as Utah's secular government.

After the abortive [[Utah War]] of 1857–1858, the replacement of Young by an outside Federal Territorial Governor, intense federal prosecution of LDS Church leaders, and the eventual resolution of controversies regarding [[plural marriage]], and accession by Utah to statehood, the apparent temporal aspects of LDS [[theodemocracy]] receded markedly.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Perry and Christopher Cronin, ''Mormons in American Politics: From Persecution to Power'' (ABC-CLIO, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persia===
During the [[Achaemenid Empire]], [[Zoroastrianism]] was the state religion and included formalized worship. The Persian kings were known to be pious Zoroastrians and also ruled with a Zoroastrian form of law called ''[[asha]]''. However, [[Cyrus the Great]], who founded the empire, avoided imposing the Zoroastrian faith on the inhabitants of conquered territory. Cyrus's kindness towards Jews has been cited{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2016}} as sparking Zoroastrian influence on Judaism.

Under the Seleucids, Zoroastrianism became autonomous. During the [[Sassanid]] period, the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] was reformed, image-use was banned, [[Fire Temples]] were increasingly built and intolerance towards other faiths prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/zoroastrian/history/persia_1.shtml Zoroastrianism under Persian rule] retrieved 5 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
The short reign (1494–1498) of [[Girolamo Savonarola]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest, over the city of Florence had features of a theocracy. During his rule, "un-Christian" books, statues, poetry, and other items were burned (in the [[Bonfire of the Vanities]]), [[sodomy]] was made a capital offense, and other Christian practices became law.

'''Trademark dilution''' is a [[trademark]] law concept giving the owner of a famous trademark [[Standing (law)|standing]] to forbid others from using that mark in a way that would lessen its uniqueness. In most cases, trademark dilution involves an unauthorized use of another's trademark on products that do not compete with, and have little connection with, those of the trademark owner. For example, a famous trademark used by one company to refer to hair care products might be ''diluted'' if another company began using a similar mark to refer to [[breakfast cereal]]s or [[spark plug]]s.&lt;ref name = "Ty Inc."&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Ty Inc. v. Perryman|vol= 306|reporter= F.3d|opinion= 509|pinpoint= |court= 7th Cir.|date= 2002|url= http://www.leagle.com/decision/2002815306F3d509_1786|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dilution is a basis of trademark infringement that applies only to famous marks. With non-famous marks, the owner of the mark must show that the allegedly infringing use creates a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the product or service being identified by the allegedly infringing use. With non-famous marks, it is highly unlikely a likelihood of confusion will be found if the products or services are in unrelated markets. However, with famous marks, any use by another person of the mark has the potential for confusion, since a famous mark is so well known among the consuming public that people will assume affiliation with the owner of the mark regardless of the product or service being sold under the infringing use.

==Background==
Trademark law traditionally concerned itself with situations where an unauthorized party sold goods that are directly competitive with or at least related to those sold by the trademark owner. A trademark is diluted when the use of similar or identical trademarks in other non-competing markets means that the trademark in and of itself will lose its capacity to signify a single source. In other words, unlike ordinary trademark law, dilution protection extends to trademark uses that do not confuse consumers regarding who has made a product. Instead, dilution protection law aims to protect sufficiently strong trademarks from losing their singular association in the public mind with a particular product, perhaps imagined if the trademark were to be encountered independently of any product (e.g., just the word [[Pepsi-Cola|Pepsi]] spoken, or on a [[Billboard (advertising)|billboard]]).&lt;ref name = "Ty Inc."/&gt;

==Requirements for protection==
The strength required for a trademark to deserve dilution protection differs among jurisdictions, though it generally includes the requirement that it must be distinctive, famous, or even unique. Such trademarks would include instantly recognizable brand names, such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[Kleenex]], [[Kool-Aid]], or [[Sony]], and unique terms that were invented (such as [[ExxonMobil|Exxon]]) rather than surnames (such as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] or [[Frank Zamboni|Zamboni]]) or ordinary words in language. Some [[jurisdiction]]s require additional registration of these trademarks as '''defensive marks''' in order to qualify for dilution protection.

Another way of describing the necessary strength of a trademark may establish some basis for dilution protection from a consumer-confusion standpoint. Truly famous trademarks are likely to be seen in many different contexts due to branching out or simple sponsorship, to the extent that there may be very few markets, if any, that a consumer would be surprised to see that famous trademark involved in. A prime example may be the past involvement of Coca-Cola in clothing lines.

==Blurring and tarnishment==
Dilution is sometimes divided into two related concepts: blurring, or essentially basic dilution, which "blurs" a mark from association with only one product to signify other products in other markets (such as "Kodak shoes"); and tarnishment, which is the weakening of a mark through unsavory or unflattering associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. Haute Diggity Dog, LLC|vol= 464|reporter= F. Supp. 2d|opinion= 495|pinpoint= 504-505|court= E.D. Va.|date= 2006|url= http://counterfeitchic.com/cases/hautediggity.pdf|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all dilution protection laws recognize tarnishment as an included concept.

==Laws by country==

===Canada ===

In Canada, the legal basis can be found in s. 22 of the ''[[Trade-marks Act]]'':

{{cquote|
'''22'''. (1) no person shall use a trade mark registered by another person in a manner that is likely to have the effect of depreciating the value of the goodwill attaching thereto.

(2) In any action in respect of a use of a trade mark contrary to subsection (1), the court may decline to order the recovery of damages or profits and may permit the defendant to continue to sell wares marked with the trade-mark that were in his possession or under his control at the time notice was given to him that the owner of the registered trade-mark complained of the use of the trade-mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Trade-marks Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. T-13), s. 22|url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/section-22.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
 
It is commonly acknowledged that goodwill is constituted by the reputation of a trade mark and its persuasive effect.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=525}}

==== Application of Section 22 by Canadian Courts ====

In the ''Clairol'' case,&lt;ref name = "Clairol"&gt;''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/55775674/Clairol-International-Corp-v-Thomas-Supply Clairol International Corp. v. Thomas Supply &amp; Equipment Co. Ltd.]'', (1968) 55 C.P.R. 176, [1968] 2 Ex. C.R. 552&lt;/ref&gt; the court stated that goodwill can be depreciated through "reduction of the esteem in which the mark itself is held or through the direct persuasion and enticing of customers who could otherwise be expected to buy or continue to buy goods bearing the trade mark". The court added that the test of confusion is irrelevant here and that the "test is the likelihood of depreciating the value of the goodwill attaching to the trade mark" and that this result could be obtained without actual deception/confusion.&lt;ref name = "Clairol"/&gt;

S. 22 thus steps where confusion fails to tread. Even if there is no actual risk that the consumer might be confused between the two products, the trade mark owner will still be able to prevent another person from using his/her trade mark if that use is likely to depreciate the value of the trade mark.

In the ''Veuve Clicquot'' case,&lt;ref&gt;''Veuve Clicquot Consardin v Boutiques Cliquot Ltéé''&lt;/ref&gt; the trade mark of the famous French champagne was used by a small chain of women's clothing store that was trading in eastern Quebec and Ottawa. According to the court, s. 22 applies even where a defendant's wares or services do not compete with the plaintiff's and their mark are not identical. The marks were not identical ("Cliquot" and "Veuve clicquot") and the risk of confusing the champagne brand and a clothing store was low. However the court ruled that the only element needed was the ability of an average consumer to recognize the first distinctive character. Even if the trade mark is not that well known, the fact that a significant goodwill is attached to it might be enough for the court to find the use by another person unlawful.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=526}} However, in that particular case, the court claimed that the plaintiff [[Veuve Clicquot]] failed to prove that the linkage between Champagne and clothing was likely to cause depreciation.

In the ''Perrier'' case,&lt;ref&gt;''Source Perrier v. Fira-Less Marketing Co. Limited'', [1983] 2 F.C. 18&lt;/ref&gt; the plaintiff, a French company, was the bottler and distributor of spring water. It sought an injunction to restrain another company base in Ontario from advertising and distributing bottled water in association with the name "Pierre eh!" claiming that the value of the goodwill attached to the French trade mark would likely be depreciated. The plaintiff succeeded on section 22 to stop the use of "Pierre Eh!" on bottled water.

==== Proving depreciation of goodwill====

The plaintiff has to prove the elements of section 22, particularly that the use would likely depreciate the value of the goodwill of the claimant's mark. A precision has been made by Vaver, that the fact "that the use could well cause depreciation is not enough. The use must actually have caused depreciation".{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=526}}

==== Limits to the use of Section 22 ====

The use of Section 22 was restricted in the Clairol case to the use "in the technical trade-mark sense". For example, unions are allowed to use the trade mark to caricature because caricature or criticism is not a trade mark infringement, nor event a use of the trade mark, if it occurs outside "the normal course of trade". (see also The Michelin v CAW case. In that case, the court rejected the trade mark infringement argument because no one was planning on using the trade mark to sell a product).

===United States===
Prior to specifically targeted laws being adopted, dilution protection was used in some U.S. jurisdictions to attack domain name infringement of trademarks (see [[Cybersquatting]]). For example, in the 1998 case of ''Panavision International v. Toeppen'', defendant [[Dennis Toeppen]] registered the domain name www.panavision.com, and posted aerial views of the city of [[Pana, Illinois]] on the site. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found that trademark dilution occurred when potential customers of [[Panavision]] could not find its web site at panavision.com, and instead were forced to search through other (less obvious) domain names. The fact that potential customers might be discouraged from locating Panavision's legitimate website, coupled with evidence that Toeppen was in the business of registering domain names for profit, led the court to find that Toeppen's conduct "diminished the capacity of the Panavision marks to identify and distinguish Panavision's goods and services on the Internet", and thus constituted dilution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Panavision Int'l v. Toeppen|vol= 141|reporter= F.3d|opinion= 1316|pinpoint= |court= 9th Cir. |date= 1998|url= http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&amp;case=/uscircs/9th/9755467.html|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lately, the [[Trademark Dilution Revision Act]] of 2006 (H.R. 683), was signed into law, which overturned ''[[Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|537|418|2003}}. ''Moseley'' held the plaintiff needed to prove ''actual'' dilution under the Federal Trademark Dilution Act ("FTDA"). The new law revises the FTDA, requiring the plaintiff to show only that the defendant's mark is ''likely'' to cause dilution.&lt;ref&gt;Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006, {{USStatute|109|312|120|1730}}, amending {{uscsub|15|1125|c}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the revision also reduced the universe of marks falling under its protection, requiring that marks be nationally well known to qualify for protection from dilution.

For example, when Wolfe's Borough Coffee, Inc., a New Hampshire-based coffee company, sold its coffee under the trademarks that included the words "Charbucks Blend" and "Mr. Charbucks," [[Starbucks Corporation]] sued, claiming that the use of the word "Charbucks" diluted the "Starbucks" mark by both blurring and tarnishment. The [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] decided&lt;ref name=leagle&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Starbucks Corporation v. Wolfe's Borough Coffee, Inc. d/b/a Black Bear Micro Roastery|vol= 588|reporter= F.3d|opinion= 97|pinpoint= |court= 2d Cir.|date= 2009|url= http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FCO%2020131115094.xml/STARBUCKS%20CORPORATION%20v.%20WOLFE%27S%20BOROUGH%20COFFEE,%20INC.|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that marks need not be "substantially similar" under the FTDA for dilution to occur when other factors supporting a finding of dilution, such as the distinctiveness of the famous mark and the degree of its recognition, were present. In its decision, the court found that these other factors may be sufficient to support a dilution claim and remanded the case to the district court in order to determine whether dilution had in fact occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sunsteinlaw.com/has-starbucks-been-diluted-the-ongoing-effort-to-protect-famous-marks/ |title = Has STARBUCKS Been Diluted? The Ongoing Effort to Protect Famous Marks|author = Steve Abreu|date = January 2010|publisher = Sunstein Kann Murphy &amp; Timbers LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2015}} The district court ruled that sales of Charbucks did not violate the trademark and could continue.&lt;ref name=leagle /&gt;

The '''Universal Mobile Telecommunications System''' ('''UMTS''') is a [[3G|third generation]] mobile cellular system for networks based on the [[GSM]] standard. Developed and maintained by the [[3GPP]] (3rd Generation Partnership Project), UMTS is a component of the [[International Telecommunications Union]] [[IMT-2000]] standard set and compares with the [[CDMA2000]] standard set for networks based on the competing [[IS-95|cdmaOne]] technology. UMTS uses wideband [[code division multiple access]] (W-CDMA) radio access technology to offer greater spectral efficiency and bandwidth to mobile network operators.

UMTS specifies a complete network system, which includes the [[radio access network]] ([[UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network]], or UTRAN), the [[core network]] ([[Mobile Application Part]], or MAP) and the authentication of users via SIM ([[subscriber identity module]]) cards.

The technology described in UMTS is sometimes also referred to as [[Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access]] (FOMA)&lt;ref name="othernames"&gt;{{cite web |title=Draft summary minutes, decisions and actions from 3GPP Organizational Partners Meeting#6, Tokyo, 9 October 2001 |publisher =3GPP |url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/op/OP_07/DOCS/pdf/OP6_13r1.pdf |format=PDF |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 3GSM.

Unlike [[EDGE]] (IMT Single-Carrier, based on [[GSM]]) and CDMA2000 (IMT Multi-Carrier), UMTS requires new base stations and new frequency allocations.

== Features ==
UMTS supports maximum theoretical data [[Bit rate|transfer rates]] of 42 [[Mbit/s]] when [[Evolved HSPA]] (HSPA+) is implemented in the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/communications/soa/Telstra-boosts-Next-G-to-21Mbps/0,130061791,339293706,00.htm | title=Telstra boosts Next G to 21Mbps | first=Suzanne | last=Tindal | date=8 December 2008 | publisher=[[ZDNet]] Australia | accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users in deployed networks can expect a transfer rate of up to 384 kbit/s for Release '99 (R99) handsets (the original UMTS release), and 7.2&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s for [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access]] (HSDPA) handsets in the downlink connection. These speeds are significantly faster than the 9.6 kbit/s of a single GSM error-corrected circuit switched data channel, multiple 9.6 kbit/s channels in [[High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data]] (HSCSD) and 14.4 kbit/s for CDMAOne channels.

Since 2006, UMTS networks in many countries have been or are in the process of being upgraded with [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access]] (HSDPA), sometimes known as [[3.5G]]. Currently, HSDPA enables [[downlink]] transfer speeds of up to 21 Mbit/s. Work is also progressing on improving the uplink transfer speed with the [[High-Speed Uplink Packet Access]] (HSUPA). Longer term, the [[3GPP Long Term Evolution]] (LTE) project plans to move UMTS to 4G speeds of 100 Mbit/s down and 50 Mbit/s up, using a next generation air interface technology based upon [[OFDM|orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]].

The first national consumer UMTS networks launched in 2002 with a heavy emphasis on telco-provided mobile applications such as mobile TV and [[Video teleconference|video calling]]. The high data speeds of UMTS are now most often utilised for Internet access: experience in Japan and elsewhere has shown that user demand for video calls is not high, and telco-provided audio/video content has declined in popularity in favour of high-speed access to the World Wide Web—either directly on a handset or connected to a computer via [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]] or [[USB]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=April 2015}}

== Air interfaces ==
[[File:UMTS structures.svg|thumb|400px|UMTS network architecture]]
UMTS combines three different terrestrial [[air interface]]s, [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]]'s [[Mobile Application Part]] (MAP) core, and the GSM family of speech codecs.

The  air interfaces are called '''UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access''' ('''UTRA''').&lt;ref name="glossary01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3gnewsroom.com/html/glossary/u.shtml |title=3G Glossary – UTRA | website=3GNewsroom.com |date=2003-11-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406074310/http://www.3gnewsroom.com/html/glossary/u.shtml |archivedate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; All air interface options are part of [[ITU]]'s [[IMT-2000]]. In the currently most popular variant for cellular mobile telephones, W-CDMA (IMT Direct Spread) is used.

Please note that the terms W-CDMA, TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA are misleading. While they suggest covering just a [[channel access method]] (namely a variant of [[CDMA]]), they are actually the common names for the whole air interface standards.&lt;ref name="ituover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-d/opb/stg/D-STG-SG02.18-1-2006-PDF-E.pdf|author=ITU-D Study Group 2|title=Guidelines on the smooth transition of existing mobile networks to IMT-2000 for developing countries (GST); Report on Question 18/2|accessdate=2009-06-15|pages=4, 25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== W-CDMA (UTRA-FDD) ===
[[File:3G symbol Android.png|thumb|3G sign shown in notification bar on an Android powered smartphone.]]
[[File:UMTS-fridge.jpg|thumb|UMTS base station on the roof of a building]]

'''W-CDMA''' or '''WCDMA''' ('''Wideband [[Code Division Multiple Access]]'''), along with '''UMTS-FDD''', '''UTRA-FDD''', or '''IMT-2000 CDMA Direct Spread''' is an [[air interface]] standard found in [[3G]] [[mobile telecommunications]] networks. It supports conventional cellular voice, text and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] services, but can also carry data at high speeds, allowing mobile operators to deliver higher bandwidth applications including streaming and broadband Internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsma.com/aboutus/gsm-technology/3gwcdma |title=What is 3G/WCDMA? |publisher=GSMA.com |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W-CDMA uses the [[DS-CDMA]] channel access method with a pair of 5&amp;nbsp;MHz wide channels. In contrast, the competing [[CDMA2000]] system uses one or more available 1.25&amp;nbsp;MHz channels for each direction of communication. W-CDMA systems are widely criticized for their large spectrum usage, which delayed deployment in countries that acted relatively slowly in allocating new frequencies specifically for 3G services (such as the United States).

The specific [[Band (radio)|frequency bands]] originally defined by the UMTS standard are 1885–2025&amp;nbsp;MHz for the mobile-to-base (uplink) and 2110–2200&amp;nbsp;MHz for the base-to-mobile (downlink). In the US, 1710–1755&amp;nbsp;MHz and 2110–2155&amp;nbsp;MHz are used instead, as the 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz band was already used.&lt;ref&gt;The FCC's [http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/aws/data/awsbandplan.pdf Advanced Wireless Services bandplan]&lt;/ref&gt; While UMTS2100 is the most widely deployed UMTS band, some countries' UMTS operators use the 850&amp;nbsp;MHz and/or 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz bands (independently, meaning uplink and downlink are within the same band), notably in the US by [[AT&amp;T Mobility]], New Zealand by [[Telecom New Zealand]] on the [[XT Mobile Network]] and in Australia by [[Telstra]] on the [[Next G]] network.  Some carriers such as [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] use band numbers to identify the UMTS frequencies.  For example, Band I (2100&amp;nbsp;MHz), Band IV (1700/2100&amp;nbsp;MHz), and Band V (850&amp;nbsp;MHz).

'''UMTS-FDD''' is an acronym for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) - [[frequency-division duplex]]ing (FDD) and a [[3GPP]] [[standardized]] version of UMTS networks that makes use of [[frequency-division duplex]]ing for [[duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]]ing over an UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access ([[UTRA]]) air interface.&lt;ref name="ts25.201"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/25201.htm |title=TS 25.201 |accessdate=2009-02-23 |author=3GPP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W-CDMA is the basis of Japan's [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access|FOMA]] service and the most-commonly used member of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) family and sometimes used as a synonym for UMTS.&lt;ref&gt;[[3GPP]] notes that “there currently existed many different names for the same system (eg FOMA, W-CDMA, UMTS, etc)”; {{cite web|title=Draft summary minutes, decisions and actions from 3GPP Organizational Partners Meeting#6, Tokyo, 9 October 2001|author=[[3GPP]]|url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/op/OP_07/DOCS/pdf/OP6_13r1.pdf|format=PDF|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the [[DS-CDMA]] channel access method and the [[Frequency-division duplex|FDD]] duplexing method to achieve higher speeds and support more users compared to most previously used [[time division multiple access]] (TDMA) and [[time division duplex]] (TDD) schemes.

While not an evolutionary upgrade on the airside, it uses the same [[core network]] as the [[2G]] [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] networks deployed worldwide, allowing [[dual mode mobile]] operation along with GSM/[[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]]; a feature it shares with other members of the UMTS family.

==== Development ====
In the late 1990s, W-CDMA was developed by [[NTT DoCoMo]] as the [[air interface]] for their 3G network [[FOMA]]. Later NTT DoCoMo submitted the specification to the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) as a candidate for the international 3G standard known as [[IMT-2000]]. The ITU eventually accepted W-CDMA as part of the IMT-2000 family of 3G standards, as an alternative to [[CDMA2000]], [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]], and the short range [[DECT]] system. Later, W-CDMA was selected as an air interface for [[UMTS frequency bands|UMTS]].

As NTT DoCoMo did not wait for the finalisation of the 3G Release 99 specification, their network was initially incompatible with UMTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Hsiao-Hwa Chen|title=The Next Generation CDMA Technologies|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2007|isbn=978-0-470-02294-8|pages=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has been resolved by NTT DoCoMo updating their network.

Code Division Multiple Access communication networks have been developed by a number of companies over the years, but development of cell-phone networks based on CDMA (prior to W-CDMA) was dominated by [[Qualcomm]], the first company to succeed in developing a practical and cost-effective CDMA implementation for consumer cell phones and its early [[cdmaOne|IS-95]] air interface standard has evolved into the current CDMA2000 (IS-856/IS-2000) standard. Qualcomm created an experimental wideband CDMA system called CDMA2000 '''3x''' which unified the W-CDMA ([[3rd Generation Partnership Project|3GPP]]) and CDMA2000 ([[3rd Generation Partnership Project 2|3GPP2]]) network technologies into a single design for a worldwide standard air interface. Compatibility with CDMA2000 would have beneficially enabled roaming on existing networks beyond Japan, since Qualcomm CDMA2000 networks are widely deployed, especially in the Americas, with coverage in 58 countries {{as of|2006|lc=on}}. However, divergent requirements resulted in the W-CDMA standard being retained and deployed globally. W-CDMA has then become the dominant technology with 457 commercial networks in 178 countries as of April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsacom.com/downloads/pdf/HSPA_operator_commitments_160412.php4|title=GSM Association HSPA Market update April 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several CDMA2000 operators have even converted their networks to W-CDMA for international roaming compatibility and smooth upgrade path to [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]].

Despite incompatibility with existing air-interface standards, late introduction and the high upgrade cost of deploying an all-new transmitter technology, W-CDMA has become the dominant standard.

==== Rationale for W-CDMA ====
W-CDMA transmits on a pair of 5&amp;nbsp;MHz-wide radio channels, while CDMA2000 transmits on one or several pairs of 1.25&amp;nbsp;MHz radio channels. Though W-CDMA does use a [[Direct-sequence spread spectrum|direct sequence]] CDMA transmission technique like CDMA2000, W-CDMA is not simply a wideband version of CDMA2000. The W-CDMA system is a new design by NTT DoCoMo, and it differs in many aspects from CDMA2000. From an engineering point of view, W-CDMA provides a different balance of trade-offs between cost, capacity, performance, and density{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}; it also promises to achieve a benefit of reduced cost for video phone handsets. W-CDMA may also be better suited for deployment in the very dense cities of Europe and Asia. However, hurdles remain, and [[cross-licensing]] of [[patent]]s between Qualcomm and W-CDMA vendors has not eliminated possible patent issues due to the features of W-CDMA which remain covered by Qualcomm patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/04/05/HNqualcommonnokiapatents_1.html|title=Qualcomm says it doesn't need Nokia patents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W-CDMA has been developed into a complete set of specifications, a detailed protocol that defines how a mobile phone communicates with the tower, how signals are modulated, how datagrams are structured, and system interfaces are specified allowing free competition on technology elements.

==== Deployment ====
The world's first commercial W-CDMA service, [[FOMA]], was launched by NTT DoCoMo in [[Japan]] in 2001.

Elsewhere, W-CDMA deployments are usually marketed under the UMTS brand.

W-CDMA has also been adapted for use in satellite communications on the U.S. [[Mobile User Objective System]] using geosynchronous satellites in place of cell towers.

[[J-Phone]] Japan (once [[Vodafone]] and now [[SoftBank Mobile]]) soon followed by launching their own W-CDMA based service, originally branded "Vodafone Global Standard" and claiming UMTS compatibility.  The name of the service was changed to "Vodafone 3G" (now "SoftBank 3G") in December 2004.

Beginning in 2003, [[Hutchison Whampoa]] gradually launched their upstart UMTS networks.
 
Most countries have, since the ITU approved of the 3G mobile service, either "auctioned" the radio frequencies to the company willing to pay the most, or conducted a "beauty contest"—asking the various companies to present what they intend to commit to if awarded the licences. This strategy has been criticised for aiming to drain the cash of operators to the brink of bankruptcy in order to honour their bids or proposals. Most of them have a time constraint for the rollout of the service—where a certain "coverage" must be achieved within a given date or the licence will be revoked.

[[Vodafone]] launched several UMTS networks in Europe in February 2004. [[MobileOne]] of [[Singapore]] commercially launched its 3G (W-CDMA) services in February 2005. [[New Zealand]] in August 2005 and [[Australia]] in October 2005.

[[AT&amp;T Wireless]] (now a part of [[Cingular]] Wireless) has deployed UMTS in several cities.  Though advancements in its network deployment have been delayed due to the merger with Cingular, Cingular began offering [[HSDPA]] service in December 2005.

Rogers in [[Canada]] March 2007 has launched [[HSDPA]] in the Toronto Golden Horseshoe district on W-CDMA at 850/1900&amp;nbsp;MHz and plan the launch the service commercial  in the top 25 cities October, 2007.

[[TeliaSonera]] opened W-CDMA service in [[Finland]] October 13, 2004 with speeds up to 384 kbit/s. Availability only in main cities. Pricing is approx. €2/MB. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

[[SK Telecom]] and [[KTF]], two largest mobile phone service providers in [[South Korea]], have each started offering W-CDMA service in December 2003. Due to poor coverage and lack of choice in handhelds, the W-CDMA service has barely made a dent in the Korean market which was dominated by [[CDMA2000]]. By October 2006 both companies are covering more than 90 cities while [[SK Telecom]] has announced that it will provide nationwide coverage for its WCDMA network in order for it to offer SBSM (Single Band Single Mode) handsets by the first half of 2007. [[KT Freecel]] will thus cut funding to its CDMA2000 network development to the minimum.

In [[Norway]], [[Telenor]] introduced W-CDMA in major cities by the end of 2004, while their competitor, [[NetCom (Norway)|NetCom]], followed suit a few months later. Both operators have 98% national coverage on [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]], but Telenor has parallel WLAN roaming networks on GSM, where the UMTS service is competing with this. For this reason Telenor is dropping support of their WLAN service in Austria (2006).

[[Maxis Communications]] and [[Celcom]], two mobile phone service providers in [[Malaysia]], started offering W-CDMA services in 2005.

In [[Sweden]], [[Telia Company|Telia]] introduced W-CDMA March 2004.

=== UTRA-TDD ===
'''UMTS-TDD''', an acronym for '''Universal Mobile Telecommunications System''' ('''UMTS''') - '''time-division duplexing''' ('''TDD'''), is a [[3GPP]] [[standardized]] version of UMTS networks that use UTRA-TDD.&lt;ref name="ts25.201"/&gt; UTRA-TDD is a [[UTRA]] that uses [[time-division duplex]]ing for [[duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]]ing.&lt;ref name="ts25.201"/&gt; While a full implementation of UMTS, it is mainly used to provide Internet access in circumstances similar to those where [[WiMAX]] might be used.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} UMTS-TDD is not directly compatible with UMTS-FDD: a device designed to use one standard cannot, unless specifically designed to, work on the other, because of the difference in air interface technologies and frequencies used.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  It is more formally as IMT-2000 CDMA-TDD or IMT 2000 Time-Division (IMT-TD).&lt;ref name="Forkel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.11.3672 |title=Performance Comparison Between UTRA-TDD High Chip Rate And Low Chip Rate Operation |accessdate=2009-02-16 |author=Forkel|year=2002|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whatistdscdma" /&gt;

The two UMTS air interfaces (UTRAs) for UMTS-TDD are TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA. Both air interfaces use a combination of two [[channel access method]]s, [[code division multiple access]] (CDMA) and [[time division multiple access]] (TDMA): the frequency band is divided into time slots (TDMA), which are further divided into channels using CDMA spreading codes. These air interfaces are classified as TDD, because time slots can be allocated to either uplink or downlink traffic.

==== TD-CDMA (UTRA-TDD 3.84 Mcps High Chip Rate (HCR)) ====
'''TD-CDMA''', an acronym for '''Time-division-Code division multiple access''', is a [[channel access method]] based on using [[spread spectrum]] multiple access ([[Code division multiple access|CDMA]]) across multiple time slots ([[Time-division multiplexing|TDMA]]). TD-CDMA is the [[channel access method]] for '''UTRA-TDD HCR''', which is an acronym for '''UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access-Time Division Duplex High Chip Rate'''.&lt;ref name="Forkel"/&gt;

UMTS-TDD's air interfaces that use the TD-CDMA channel access technique are standardized as '''UTRA-TDD HCR''', which uses increments of 5&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]] of spectrum, each slice divided into 10&amp;nbsp;ms frames containing fifteen time slots (1500 per second).&lt;ref name="Forkel"/&gt; The time slots (TS) are allocated in fixed percentage for downlink and uplink. TD-CDMA is used to multiplex streams from or to multiple transceivers. Unlike W-CDMA, it does not need separate frequency bands for up- and downstream, allowing deployment in tight [[frequency band]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UMTS World TD-CDMA information|url=http://www.umtsworld.com/technology/tdcdma.htm|publisher=umtsworld.com|accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TD-CDMA is a part of [[IMT-2000]], defined as IMT-TD Time-Division ('''IMT CDMA TDD'''), and is one of the three UMTS air interfaces ([[UTRA]]s), as standardized by the [[3GPP]] in UTRA-TDD HCR. UTRA-TDD HCR is closely related to W-CDMA, and provides the same types of channels where possible. UMTS's [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access|HSDPA]]/[[High-Speed Uplink Packet Access|HSUPA]] enhancements are also implemented under TD-CDMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPWireless Ships First Commercial 3GPP Chipset with Full HSDPA Implementation|url=http://www.ipwireless.com/news/press_020805.html|publisher=ipwireless.com|accessdate=2008-02-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010536/http://www.ipwireless.com/news/press_020805.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the technology have been used for public safety and government use in the [[New York City]] and a few other area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/ipwireless-introduces-td-cdma-network-a-box-targeting-rural-operators-public-safety|title=IPWireless introduces TD-CDMA Network in a Box targeting rural operators, public safety - FierceWireless|website=www.fiercewireless.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, IPMobile planned to provide TD-CDMA service in year 2006, but it was delayed, changed to TD-SCDMA, and bankrupt before the service officially started.

==== TD-SCDMA (UTRA-TDD 1.28 Mcps Low Chip Rate (LCR)) ====

'''Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access''' ('''TD-SCDMA''') or '''UTRA TDD 1.28 [[Cycle per second|mcps]] low chip rate''' ('''UTRA-TDD LCR''')&lt;ref name="whatistdscdma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdscdma-forum.org/en/pdfword/200511817463050335.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330050828/http://www.tdscdma-forum.org/en/pdfword/200511817463050335.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-30|title=TD-SCDMA Whitepaper: the Solution for TDD bands|author=Siemens|publisher=TD Forum|format=pdf|accessdate=2009-06-15|date=2004-06-10|pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ituover"/&gt; is an [[air interface]]&lt;ref name="whatistdscdma"/&gt; found in UMTS [[mobile telecommunications]] networks in China as an alternative to W-CDMA.

TD-SCDMA uses the [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] channel access method combined with an adaptive [[synchronous CDMA]] component&lt;ref name="whatistdscdma"/&gt; on 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz slices of spectrum, allowing deployment in even tighter frequency bands than TD-CDMA. It is standardized by the 3GPP and also referred to as "UTRA-TDD LCR". However, the main incentive for development of this Chinese-developed standard was avoiding or reducing the license fees that have to be paid to non-Chinese patent owners. Unlike the other air interfaces, TD-SCDMA was not part of UMTS from the beginning but has been added in Release 4 of the specification.

Like TD-CDMA, TD-SCDMA is known as '''IMT CDMA TDD''' within IMT-2000.

The term "TD-SCDMA" is misleading. While it suggests covering only a channel access method, it is actually the common name for the whole air interface specification.&lt;ref name="ituover"/&gt;

TD-SCDMA / UMTS-TDD (LCR) networks are incompatible with W-CDMA / UMTS-FDD and TD-CDMA / UMTS-TDD (HCR) networks.

===== Objectives =====
TD-SCDMA was developed in the People's Republic of China by the Chinese Academy of Telecommunications Technology (CATT), [[Datang Telecom]], and [[Siemens AG]] in an attempt to avoid dependence on Western technology. This is likely primarily for practical reasons, since other [[3G]] formats require the payment of patent fees to a large number of Western patent holders.

TD-SCDMA proponents also claim it is better suited for densely populated areas.&lt;ref name="whatistdscdma"/&gt; Further, it is supposed to cover all usage scenarios, whereas W-CDMA is optimised for symmetric traffic and macro cells, while TD-CDMA is best used in low mobility scenarios within micro or pico cells.&lt;ref name="whatistdscdma"/&gt;
 
TD-SCDMA is based on spread spectrum technology which makes it unlikely that it will be able to completely escape the payment of license fees to western patent holders. The launch of a national TD-SCDMA network was initially projected by 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetasia.com/ART_8800451183_499488_67aa06a5200701_no.HTM ''3G in China still held up''], EE Times Asia, Global Sources&lt;/ref&gt; but only reached large scale commercial trials with 60,000 users across eight cities in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cellular-news.com/story/30163.php ''China Mobile to Test Td-scdma on 60,000 Phones from April 1,''], Cellular News&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 2009, China granted a TD-SCDMA 3G licence to [[China Mobile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUKTRE5061KP20090107 ''China issues 3G licences to main carriers''] The Reuters UK&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2009, China Mobile officially announced that it had 1,327,000 TD-SCDMA subscribers as of the end of August, 2009.

While TD is primarily a China-only system, it may well be exported to developing countries. It is likely to be replaced with a newer [[TD-LTE]] system over the next 5 years.

===== Technical highlights =====
TD-SCDMA uses [[Duplex (telecommunications)#Time-division duplexing|TDD]], in contrast to the [[Duplex (telecommunications)#Frequency-division duplexing|FDD]] scheme used by [[W-CDMA]].  By dynamically adjusting the number of timeslots used for [[downlink]] and [[uplink]], the system can more easily accommodate asymmetric traffic with different data rate requirements on downlink and uplink than FDD schemes.  Since it does not require paired spectrum for downlink and uplink, spectrum allocation flexibility is also increased.  Using the same carrier frequency for uplink and downlink also means that the channel condition is the same on both directions, and the [[base station]] can deduce the downlink channel information from uplink channel estimates, which is helpful to the application of [[beamforming]] techniques.

TD-SCDMA also uses [[time division multiple access|TDMA]] in addition to the [[code division multiple access|CDMA]] used in WCDMA.  This reduces the number of users in each timeslot, which reduces the implementation complexity of [[multiuser detection]] and [[beamforming]] schemes, but the non-continuous transmission also reduces [[coverage (telecommunication)|coverage]] (because of the higher peak power needed), mobility (because of lower [[power control]] frequency) and complicates [[radio resource management]] algorithms.

The "S" in TD-SCDMA stands for "synchronous", which means that uplink signals are synchronized at the base station receiver, achieved by continuous timing adjustments.  This reduces the [[Interference (communication)|interference]] between users of the same timeslot using different codes by improving the [[Orthogonality#Communications|orthogonality]] between the codes, therefore increasing system capacity, at the cost of some hardware complexity in achieving uplink synchronization.

===== History =====
On January 20, 2006, [[Ministry of Information Industry]] of the People's Republic of China formally announced that TD-SCDMA is the country's standard of 3G mobile telecommunication. On February 15, 2006, a timeline for deployment of the network in China was announced, stating pre-commercial trials would take place starting after completion of a number of test networks in select cities. These trials ran from March to October, 2006, but the results were apparently unsatisfactory. In early 2007, the Chinese government instructed the dominant cellular carrier, [[China Mobile]], to build commercial trial networks in eight cities, and the two fixed-line carriers, [[China Telecom]] and [[China Netcom]], to build one each in two other cities. Construction of these trial networks was scheduled to finish during the fourth quarter of 2007, but delays meant that construction was not complete until early 2008.

The standard has been adopted by [[3GPP]] since Rel-4, known as "UTRA TDD 1.28Mbps Option".&lt;ref name="whatistdscdma" /&gt;

On March 28, 2008, China Mobile Group announced TD-SCDMA  "commercial trials" for 60,000 test users in eight cities from April 1, 2008. Networks using other 3G standards (WCDMA and CDMA2000 EV/DO) had still not been launched in China, as these were delayed until TD-SCDMA was ready for commercial launch.

In January  2009  the [[Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Industry and Information Technology]] (MIIT) in China took the unusual step of assigning licences for 3 different third-generation mobile phone standards to three carriers in a long-awaited step that is expected to prompt $41 billion in spending on new equipment. The Chinese-developed standard, TD-SCDMA, was assigned to China Mobile, the world's biggest phone carrier by subscribers. That appeared to be an effort to make sure the new system has the financial and technical backing to succeed. Licences for two existing 3G standards, [[W-CDMA]] and [[Evolution-Data Optimized|CDMA2000 1xEV-DO]], were assigned to China Unicom and China Telecom, respectively. Third-generation, or 3G, technology supports Web surfing, wireless video and other services and the start of service is expected to spur new revenue growth.

==== Unlicensed UMTS-TDD ====
In Europe, [[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations|CEPT]] allocated the 2010-2020&amp;nbsp;MHz range for a variant of UMTS-TDD designed for unlicensed, self-provided use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ERC/DEC/(99)25 EU Recommendation on UMTS TDD|url=http://www.ero.dk/documentation/docs/doc98/official/pdf/DEC9925E.PDF|publisher=ero.dk|accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some telecom groups and jurisdictions have proposed withdrawing this service in favour of licensed UMTS-TDD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Award_of_available_spectrum:_2500-2690_MHz,_2010-2025_MHz_and_2290-2300_MHz|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/2ghzawards/2ghzawards.pdf|publisher=ofcom.org.uk|accessdate=2008-02-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030814/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/2ghzawards/2ghzawards.pdf |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to lack of demand, and lack of development of a UMTS TDD air interface technology suitable for deployment in this band.

==== Comparison with UMTS-FDD ====
Ordinary UMTS uses UTRA-FDD as an air interface and is known as [[UMTS-FDD]].  UMTS-FDD uses [[W-CDMA]] for multiple access and [[Frequency division duplex|frequency division]] for duplexing, meaning that the up-link and down-link transmit on different frequencies. UMTS is usually transmitted on frequencies assigned for [[1G]], [[2G]], or [[3G]] mobile telephone service in the countries of operation.

UMTS-TDD uses time division duplexing, allowing the up-link and down-link to share the same spectrum. This allows the operator to more flexibly divide the usage of available spectrum according to traffic patterns. For ordinary phone service, you would expect the up-link and down-link to carry approximately equal amounts of data (because every phone call needs a voice transmission in either direction), but Internet-oriented traffic is more frequently one-way. For example, when browsing a website, the user will send commands, which are short, to the server, but the server will send whole files, that are generally larger than those commands, in response.

UMTS-TDD tends to be allocated frequency intended for mobile/wireless Internet services rather than used on existing cellular frequencies. This is, in part, because TDD duplexing is not normally allowed on [[Mobile phone|cellular]], [[Personal Communications Service|PCS]]/PCN, and 3G frequencies. TDD technologies open up the usage of left-over unpaired spectrum.

Europe-wide, several bands are provided either specifically for UMTS-TDD or for similar technologies. These are 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1920&amp;nbsp;MHz and between 2010&amp;nbsp;MHz and 2025&amp;nbsp;MHz. In several countries the 2500-2690&amp;nbsp;MHz band (also known as MMDS in the USA) have been used for UMTS-TDD deployments. Additionally, spectrum around the 3.5&amp;nbsp;GHz range has been allocated in some countries, notably Britain, in a technology-neutral environment. In the Czech Republic UTMS-TDD is also used in a frequency range around 872&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T-Mobile launches UMTS TDD network in the Czech Republic|url=http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=4693|date=21 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Deployment ====
UMTS-TDD has been deployed for public and/or private networks in at least nineteen countries around the world, with live systems in, amongst other countries, Australia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Botswana, South Africa, the UK, and the USA.

Deployments in the US thus far have been limited. It has been selected for a public safety support network used by emergency responders in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northrop Grumman Wins $500 Million New York City Broadband Mobile Wireless Contract|url=http://www.ipwireless.com/news/press_091206.html|publisher=ipwireless.com|accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but outside of some experimental systems, notably one from [[Nextel]], thus far the WiMAX standard appears to have gained greater traction as a general mobile Internet access system.

==== Competing Standards ====
A variety of Internet-access systems exist which provide broadband speed access to the net. These include [[WiMAX]] and [[HIPERMAN]]. UMTS-TDD has the advantages of being able to use an operator's existing UMTS/[[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] infrastructure, should it have one, and that it includes UMTS modes optimized for circuit switching should, for example, the operator want to offer telephone service. UMTS-TDD's performance is also more consistent. However, UMTS-TDD deployers often have regulatory problems with taking advantage of some of the services UMTS compatibility provides. For example, UMTS-TDD spectrum in the UK cannot be used to provide telephone service, though the regulator [[OFCOM]] is discussing the possibility of allowing it at some point in the future. Few operators considering UMTS-TDD have existing UMTS/GSM infrastructure.

Additionally, the WiMAX and HIPERMAN systems provide significantly larger bandwidths when the mobile station is in close proximity to the tower.

Like most mobile Internet access systems, many users who might otherwise choose UMTS-TDD will find their needs covered by the ad hoc collection of unconnected [[Wifi]] access points at many restaurants and transportation hubs, and/or by Internet access already provided by their mobile phone operator. By comparison, UMTS-TDD (and systems like WiMAX) offers mobile, and more consistent, access than the former, and generally faster access than the latter.

== Radio access network ==
{{main|UTRAN}}

UMTS also specifies the '''Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network''' ('''UTRAN'''), which is composed of multiple base stations, possibly using different terrestrial air interface standards and frequency bands.

UMTS and GSM/EDGE can share a Core Network (CN), making UTRAN an alternative radio access network to [[GERAN]] (GSM/EDGE RAN), and allowing (mostly) transparent switching between the RANs according to available coverage and service needs. Because of that, UMTS's and GSM/EDGE's radio access networks are sometimes collectively referred to as '''UTRAN/GERAN'''.
 
UMTS networks are often combined with GSM/EDGE, the latter of which is also a part of IMT-2000.

The UE ([[User equipment|User Equipment]]) interface of the [[Radio access network|RAN]] (Radio Access Network) primarily consists of [[Radio Resource Control|RRC]] (Radio Resource Control), [[PDCP]] (Packet Data Convergence Protocol), [[Radio Link Control|RLC]] (Radio Link Control) and MAC (Media Access Control) protocols. RRC protocol handles connection establishment, measurements, radio bearer services, security and handover decisions. RLC protocol primarily divides into three Modes—Transparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledge Mode (UM), Acknowledge Mode (AM). The functionality of AM entity resembles TCP operation whereas UM operation resembles UDP operation. In TM mode, data will be sent to lower layers without adding any header to [[Service data unit|SDU]] of higher layers. MAC handles the scheduling of data on air interface depending on higher layer (RRC) configured parameters.

The set of properties related to data transmission is called Radio Bearer (RB). This set of properties decides the maximum allowed data in a TTI (Transmission Time Interval). RB includes RLC information and RB mapping. RB mapping decides the mapping between RB&lt;-&gt;logical channel&lt;-&gt;transport channel. Signaling messages are sent on Signaling Radio Bearers (SRBs) and data packets (either CS or PS) are sent on data RBs. RRC and [[Non Access Stratum|NAS]] messages go on SRBs.

Security includes two procedures: integrity and ciphering. Integrity validates the resource of messages and also makes sure that no one (third/unknown party) on the radio interface has modified the messages. Ciphering ensures that no one listens to your data on the air interface. Both integrity and ciphering are applied for SRBs whereas only ciphering is applied for data RBs.

== Core network ==
{{main|Mobile Application Part}}

With '''Mobile Application Part''', UMTS uses the same [[core network]] standard as GSM/EDGE. This allows a simple migration for existing GSM operators. However, the migration path to UMTS is still costly: while much of the core infrastructure is shared with GSM, the cost of obtaining new spectrum licenses and overlaying UMTS at existing towers is high.

The CN can be connected to various [[backbone network]]s, such as the [[Internet]] or an [[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN) telephone network. UMTS (and GERAN) include the three lowest layers of [[OSI model]]. The network layer (OSI 3) includes the [[Radio Resource Management]] protocol (RRM) that manages the bearer channels between the mobile terminals and the fixed network, including the handovers.

== Frequency bands and channel bandwidths ==

=== UARFCN ===
A '''UARFCN''' ([[abbreviation]] for [[UTRA]] Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number, where UTRA stands for UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access) is used to identify a frequency in the [[UMTS frequency bands]].

Typically channel number is derived from the frequency in MHz through the formula Channel Number = Frequency * 5.  However, this is only able to represent channels that are centered on a multiple of 200&amp;nbsp;kHz, which do not align with licensing in North America.  3GPP added several special values for the common North American channels.

=== Spectrum allocation ===
{{Update|section|date=October 2013}}
{{main|UMTS frequency bands}}
Over 130 licenses have already been awarded to operators worldwide (as of December 2004), specifying [[W-CDMA]] radio access technology that builds on [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]]. In Europe, the license process occurred at the tail end of the technology bubble, and the auction mechanisms for allocation set up in some countries resulted in some extremely high prices being paid for the original 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz licenses, notably in the UK and Germany. In [[Germany]], bidders paid a total €50.8 billion for six licenses, two of which were subsequently abandoned and written off by their purchasers (Mobilcom and the [[Sonera]]/[[Telefonica]] consortium). It has been suggested that these huge license fees have the character of a very large tax paid on future income expected many years down the road. In any event, the high prices paid put some European telecom operators close to bankruptcy (most notably [[KPN]]). Over the last few years some operators have written off some or all of the license costs. Between 2007 and 2009, all three Finnish carriers began to use 900&amp;nbsp;MHz UMTS in a shared arrangement with its surrounding 2G GSM base stations for rural area coverage, a trend that is expected to expand over Europe in the next 1–3 years.{{update after|2012|6|2}}

The 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz band (downlink around 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz and uplink around 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz) allocated for UMTS in Europe and most of Asia is already used in North America. The 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz range is used for [[2G]] ([[Personal Communications Service|PCS]]) services, and 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz range is used for satellite communications. Regulators have, however, freed up some of the 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz range for 3G services, together with a different range around 1700&amp;nbsp;MHz for the uplink.

AT&amp;T Wireless launched UMTS services in the United States by the end of 2004 strictly using the existing 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum allocated for 2G PCS services. Cingular acquired AT&amp;T Wireless in 2004 and has since then launched UMTS in select US cities. Cingular renamed itself [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] and rolled out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vries|first1=Lloyd|title=From AT&amp;T To Cingular And Back Again|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/from-att-to-cingular-and-back-again/|website=CBS News|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; some cities with a UMTS network at 850&amp;nbsp;MHz to enhance its existing UMTS network at 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz and now offers subscribers a number of dual-band UMTS 850/1900 phones.

[[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]]'s rollout of UMTS in the US was originally focused on the 1700&amp;nbsp;MHz band. However, T-Mobile has been moving users from 1700&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz (PCS) in order to reallocate the spectrum to 4G [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2015/06/24/t-mobile-shifting-1700mhz-hspa-users-to-1900mhz-band/ |title=T-Mobile shifting 1700&amp;nbsp;MHz HSPA+ users to 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz band |publisher=TeleGeography |date=2015-06-24 |accessdate=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, UMTS coverage is being provided on the 850&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz bands on the Rogers and Bell-Telus networks. Bell and Telus share the network. Recently, new providers [[Wind Mobile]], [[Mobilicity]] and [[Videotron]] have begun operations in the 1700&amp;nbsp;MHz band.

In 2008, Australian telco [[Telstra]] replaced its existing CDMA network with a national UMTS-based 3G network, branded as [[NextG]], operating in the 850&amp;nbsp;MHz band. Telstra currently provides UMTS service on this network, and also on the 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz UMTS network, through a co-ownership of the owning and administrating company 3GIS. This company is also co-owned by [[Hutchison 3G|Hutchison 3G Australia]], and this is the primary network used by their customers. [[Optus]] is currently rolling out a 3G network operating on the 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz band in cities and most large towns, and the 900&amp;nbsp;MHz band in regional areas. [[Vodafone Australia|Vodafone]] is also building a 3G network using the 900&amp;nbsp;MHz band.

In India, [[BSNL]] has started its 3G services since October 2009, beginning with the larger cities and then expanding over to smaller cities. The 850&amp;nbsp;MHz and 900&amp;nbsp;MHz bands provide greater coverage compared to equivalent 1700/1900/2100&amp;nbsp;MHz networks, and are best suited to regional areas where greater distances separate base station and subscriber.

Carriers in South America are now also rolling out 850&amp;nbsp;MHz networks.

== Interoperability and global roaming ==
UMTS phones (and data cards) are highly portable—they have been designed to roam easily onto other UMTS networks (if the providers have roaming agreements in place). In addition, almost all UMTS phones are UMTS/GSM dual-mode devices, so if a UMTS phone travels outside of UMTS coverage during a call the call may be transparently handed off to available GSM coverage. Roaming charges are usually significantly higher than regular usage charges.

Most UMTS licensees consider ubiquitous, transparent global [[roaming]] an important issue. To enable a high degree of interoperability, UMTS phones usually support several different frequencies in addition to their GSM fallback. Different countries support different [[UMTS frequency bands]] – Europe initially used 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz while the most carriers in the USA use 850&amp;#160;MHz and 
1900&amp;#160;MHz. T-Mobile has launched a network in the US operating at 1700&amp;nbsp;MHz (uplink) /2100&amp;nbsp;MHz (downlink), and these bands also have been adopted elsewhere in the US and in Canada and Latin America. A UMTS phone and network must support a common frequency to work together. Because of the frequencies used, early models of UMTS phones designated for the United States will likely not be operable elsewhere and vice versa. There are now 11 different frequency combinations used around the world—including frequencies formerly used solely for 2G services.

UMTS phones can use a [[Universal Subscriber Identity Module]], USIM (based on GSM's [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]]) and also work (including UMTS services) with GSM SIM cards. This is a global standard of identification, and enables a network to identify and authenticate the (U)SIM in the phone. Roaming agreements between networks allow for calls to a customer to be redirected to them while roaming and determine the services (and prices) available to the user. In addition to user subscriber information and authentication information, the (U)SIM provides storage space for phone book contact. Handsets can store their data on their own memory or on the (U)SIM card (which is usually more limited in its phone book contact information). A (U)SIM can be moved to another UMTS or GSM phone, and the phone will take on the user details of the (U)SIM, meaning it is the (U)SIM (not the phone) which determines the phone number of the phone and the billing for calls made from the phone.

Japan was the first country to adopt 3G technologies, and since they had not used GSM previously they had no need to build GSM compatibility into their handsets and their 3G handsets were smaller than those available elsewhere. In 2002, [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access|FOMA]] 3G network was the first commercial UMTS network—using a pre-release specification,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Hsiao-Hwa Chen|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2007|title=The Next Generation CDMA Technologies|isbn=978-0-470-02294-8|pages=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was initially incompatible with the UMTS standard at the radio level but used standard USIM cards, meaning USIM card based roaming was possible (transferring the USIM card into a UMTS or GSM phone when travelling). Both NTT DoCoMo and [[SoftBank Mobile]] (which launched 3G in December 2002) now use standard UMTS.

=== Handsets and modems ===
{{update section|date=August 2015}}
[[Image:Nokia6650 unlocked.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Nokia 6650]], an early (2003) UMTS handset]]

All of the major 2G phone manufacturers (that are still in business) are now manufacturers of 3G phones. The early 3G handsets and modems were specific to the frequencies required in their country, which meant they could only roam to other countries on the same 3G frequency (though they can fall back to the older GSM standard). Canada and USA have a common share of frequencies, as do most European countries. The article [[UMTS frequency bands]] is an overview of UMTS network frequencies around the world.

Using a [[cellular router]], PCMCIA or USB card, customers are able to access 3G broadband services, regardless of their choice of computer (such as a [[Tablet computer|tablet PC]] or a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]). Some software [[self installing|installs itself]] from the modem, so that in some cases absolutely no knowledge of technology is required to get [[online]] in moments. Using a phone that supports 3G and Bluetooth 2.0, multiple Bluetooth-capable laptops can be connected to the Internet. Some smartphones can also act as a mobile [[WLAN access point]].

There are very few 3G phones or modems available supporting all 3G frequencies (UMTS850/900/1700/1900/2100&amp;nbsp;MHz). Nokia has recently  released a range of phones that have [[Multi-band|Pentaband]] 3G coverage, including the [[Nokia N8|N8]] and [[Nokia E7-00|E7]].  Many other phones are offering more than one band which still enables extensive roaming. For example, Apple's [[iPhone 4]] contains a quadband chipset operating on 850/900/1900/2100&amp;nbsp;MHz, allowing usage in the majority of countries where UMTS-FDD is deployed.

== Other competing standards ==
The main competitor to UMTS is [[CDMA2000]] (IMT-MC), which is developed by the [[3GPP2]].  Unlike UMTS, CDMA2000 is an evolutionary upgrade to an existing 2G standard, [[cdmaOne]], and is able to operate within the same frequency allocations.  This and CDMA2000's narrower bandwidth requirements make it easier to deploy in existing spectra. In some, but not all, cases, existing GSM operators only have enough spectrum to implement either UMTS or GSM, not both. For example, in the US [http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/data/bandplans/pcsband.pdf D, E, and F PCS spectrum blocks], the amount of spectrum available is 5&amp;nbsp;MHz in each direction.  A standard UMTS system would saturate that spectrum.  Where CDMA2000 is deployed, it usually co-exists with UMTS.  In many markets however, the co-existence issue is of little relevance, as legislative hurdles exist to co-deploying two standards in the same licensed slice of spectrum.

Another competitor to UMTS is [[EDGE]] (IMT-SC), which is an evolutionary upgrade to the 2G GSM system, leveraging existing GSM spectrums.  It is also much easier, quicker, and considerably cheaper for wireless carriers to "bolt-on" EDGE functionality by upgrading their existing GSM transmission hardware to support EDGE rather than having to install almost all brand-new equipment to deliver UMTS.  However, being developed by [[3GPP]] just as UMTS, EDGE is not a true competitor. Instead, it is used as a temporary solution preceding UMTS roll-out or as a complement for rural areas.  This is facilitated by the fact that GSM/EDGE and UMTS specification are jointly developed and rely on the same [[core network]], allowing dual-mode operation including [[vertical handover]]s. &lt;!--  AT&amp;T Wireless launched EDGE nationwide in 2003, AT&amp;T launched EDGE in most markets and T-Mobile USA has launched EDGE nationwide as of October 2005.  Rogers Wireless launched nation-wide EDGE service in late 2003 for the Canadian market.  Bitė Lietuva (Lithuania) was one of the first operators in Europe to launch EDGE in December 2003. TIM (Italy) launched EDGE in 2004. — This should be part of the EDGE article, not UMTS. --&gt;

China's [[TD-SCDMA]] standard is often seen as a competitor, too. TD-SCDMA has been added to UMTS' Release 4 as UTRA-TDD 1.28 Mcps Low Chip Rate (UTRA-TDD LCR). Unlike [[TD-CDMA]] (UTRA-TDD 3.84 Mcps High Chip Rate, UTRA-TDD HCR) which complements [[W-CDMA]] (UTRA-FDD), it is suitable for both micro and macro cells. However, the lack of vendors' support is preventing it from being a real competitor.

While [[DECT]] is technically capable of competing with UMTS and other cellular networks in densely populated, urban areas, it has only been deployed for domestic cordless phones and private in-house networks.

All of these competitors have been accepted by ITU as part of the [[IMT-2000]] family of 3G standards, along with UMTS-FDD.

On the Internet access side, competing systems include [[WiMAX]] and [[Flash-OFDM]].

== Migrating from GSM/GPRS to UMTS ==
From a GSM/GPRS network, the following network elements can be reused:
* [[Home Location Register]] (HLR)
* [[Visitor Location Register]] (VLR)
* Equipment Identity Register (EIR)
* [[Mobile Switching Center]] (MSC) (vendor dependent)
* [[Authentication Center]] (AUC)
* Serving GPRS Support Node ([[SGSN]]) (vendor dependent)
* Gateway GPRS Support Node ([[GGSN]])

From a GSM/GPRS communication radio network, the following elements cannot be reused:
* '''Base station controller (BSC)'''
* Base transceiver station (BTS)
They can remain in the network and be used in dual network operation where 2G and 3G networks co-exist while network migration and new 3G terminals become available for use in the network.

The UMTS network introduces new network elements that function as specified by [[3GPP]]:
* [[Node B]] (base transceiver station)
* [[Radio Network Controller]] (RNC)
* Media Gateway (MGW)

The functionality of MSC and SGSN changes when going to UMTS. In a GSM system the MSC handles all the circuit switched operations like connecting A- and B-subscriber through the network. SGSN handles all the packet switched operations and transfers all the data in the network. In UMTS the Media gateway (MGW) take care of all data transfer in both circuit and packet switched networks. MSC and SGSN control MGW operations. The nodes are renamed to MSC-server and GSN-server.

== Problems and issues ==
Some countries, including the United States, have allocated spectrum differently from the [[International Telecommunications Union|ITU]] recommendations, so that the standard bands most commonly used for UMTS (UMTS-2100) have not been available.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In those countries, alternative bands are used, preventing the interoperability of existing UMTS-2100 equipment, and requiring the design and manufacture of different equipment for the use in these markets. As is the case with GSM900 today{{when|date=December 2014}}, standard UMTS 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz equipment will not work in those markets. However, it appears as though UMTS is not suffering as much from handset band compatibility issues as GSM did, as many UMTS handsets are multi-band in both UMTS and GSM modes. Penta-band (850, 900, 1700, 2100, and 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz bands), quad-band GSM (850, 900, 1800, and 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz bands) and tri-band UMTS (850, 1900, and 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz bands) handsets are becoming more commonplace.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In its early days{{when|date=December 2014}}, UMTS had problems in many countries: Overweight handsets with poor battery life were first to arrive on a market highly sensitive to weight and form factor.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The Motorola A830, a debut handset on Hutchison's 3 network, weighed more than 200&amp;nbsp;grams and even featured a detachable camera to reduce handset weight. Another significant issue involved call reliability, related to problems with handover from UMTS to GSM. Customers found their connections being dropped as handovers were possible only in one direction (UMTS → GSM), with the handset only changing back to UMTS after hanging up. In most networks around the world this is no longer an issue.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Compared to GSM, UMTS networks initially required a higher [[base station]] density. For fully-fledged UMTS incorporating [[video on demand]] features, one base station needed to be set up every 1–1.5&amp;nbsp;km (0.62–0.93&amp;nbsp;mi). This was the case when only the 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz band was being used, however with the growing use of lower-frequency bands (such as 850 and 900&amp;nbsp;MHz) this is no longer so. This has led to increasing rollout of the lower-band networks by operators since 2006.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Even with current technologies and low-band UMTS, telephony and data over UMTS requires more power than on comparable GSM networks. [[Apple Inc.]] cited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118306134626851922|title=iPhone 'Surfing' On AT&amp;T Network Isn't Fast, Jobs Concedes|first1=Nick|last1=Wingfield|first2=Amol|last2=Sharma|date=30 June 2007|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; UMTS power consumption as the reason that the first generation [[iPhone]] only supported [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]]. Their release of the iPhone 3G quotes talk time on UMTS as half that available when the handset is set to use GSM. Other manufacturers indicate different battery lifetime for UMTS mode compared to GSM mode as well. As battery and network technology improve, this issue is diminishing.

===Security issues===
As early as 2008 it was known that carrier networks can be used to surreptitiously gather user location information.&lt;ref name=wp814&gt;{{cite news|author1=Craig Timberg|title=For sale: Systems that can secretly track where cellphone users go around the globe|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/for-sale-systems-that-can-secretly-track-where-cellphone-users-go-around-the-globe/2014/08/24/f0700e8a-f003-11e3-bf76-447a5df6411f_story.html|accessdate=20 December 2014|work=Washington Post|date=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the Washington Post reported on widespread marketing of surveillance systems using [[Signalling System No. 7]] (SS7) protocols to locate callers anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name=wp814/&gt;

In December 2014, news broke that SS7's very own functions can be repurposed for surveillance, because of its lax security, in order to listen to calls in real time or to record encrypted calls and texts for later decryption, or to defraud users and cellular carriers.&lt;ref name=wp1214&gt;{{cite news|author1=Craig Timberg|title=German researchers discover a flaw that could let anyone listen to your cell calls.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/12/18/german-researchers-discover-a-flaw-that-could-let-anyone-listen-to-your-cell-calls-and-read-your-texts/|accessdate=20 December 2014|work=The Switch- Washington Post|publisher=Washington Post|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deutsche Telekom]] and [[Vodafone]] declared the same day that they had fixed gaps in their networks, but that the problem is global and can only be fixed with a telecommunication system-wide solution.&lt;ref name=ard&gt;{{cite news|author1=Peter Onneken|title=Sicherheitslücken im UMTS-Netz|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/umts-sicherheitsluecken-101.html|accessdate=20 December 2014|work=Tagesschau|publisher=ARD-aktuell / tagesschau.de|date=18 December 2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unsplash''' is a website dedicated to sharing [[stock photography]] under the [[Unsplash#License|Unsplash license]]. The website claims over 100,000 contributing photographers and generates more than 9 billion photo impressions per month on their growing library of over 690,000 photos.&lt;ref name="unsplashhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unsplash.com/stats|title=Stats|last1=Unsplash|first=|date=|website=Unsplash.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsplash has been cited as one of the world's leading photography websites by [[Forbes]], [[Entrepreneur Magazine]], [[CNET]], Medium and The Next Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laurinavicius|first1=Tomas|title=33 Epic Sites With Breathtaking Free Stock Photos|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaslaurinavicius/2016/03/07/free-stock-photos/|website=Forbes|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ark|first1=Casey|title=14 Amazingly Free Stock Photo Websites|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238646|website=Entrepreneur|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Taylor|title=Use these 7 sites to keep your desktop wallpaper fresh|url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/use-these-7-sites-to-keep-your-desktop-wallpaper-fresh/|website=CNET|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Senos|first1=Dustin|title=Stock photos that don’t suck|url=https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b |website=Medium |accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zee|title=Unsplash is a site full of images you can freely use for your next startup’s splash page|url=https://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2013/08/14/unsplash-is-a-site-full-of-images-you-can-use-freely-for-your-next-startups-splash-page/|website=The Next Web|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsplash allows [[photographers]] to upload photos to its website, which are then curated by a team of photo editors. The permissive [[copyright]] terms on its photos has led to Unsplash becoming one of the largest photography suppliers on the internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Czikk |first1=Joseph |title=Unsplash: We’re the most viral photo site|url=http://www.montrealintechnology.com/unsplash-were-the-most-viral-photography-platform-in-the-world/|website=Montreal in Technology|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its members’ photos frequently appearing on articles.

As from 18th February 2018 Unsplash changed their license terms to restrict the sale of photos without first updating, modifying, or otherwise incorporating new creative elements into the photos, prohibiting selling unaltered copies, including selling the photos as prints or printed on physical goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/unsplash/the-unsplash-license-f6fb7de5c95a|title=The Unsplash License|last=Unsplash|date=2018-03-06|website=Unsplash Blog|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
One of the pioneers of the [[Stock photography#Types of stock photo licenses|copyright-free photography]] model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Webb|first1=Scott|title=Free stock photography websites photographers must know ASAP|url=https://pineapplesupply.co/free-stock-photography-websites/|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsplash was created in 2013 by Montreal-based entrepreneur Mikael Cho. While creating a new homepage for his company [[Crew (company)|Crew]], Cho was unable to find a suitable stock photo and hired a photographer instead.&lt;ref name="sideprojects"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cho|first1=Mikael|title=How side projects saved our startup|url=https://qz.com/281725/how-side-projects-saved-our-startup/|website=Quartz|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Cho posted the outtakes from his company photoshoot on Tumblr, inviting people to use them as they saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bourel|first1=Fanny|title=Mikael Cho : Une tenacité payante|url=http://www.lesaffaires.com/dossier/un-quebec-fort-ils-y-croient/une-tenacite-payante/579731|website=Les Affaires|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before June 2017, photos uploaded to Unsplash were made available under the [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|Creative Commons zero]] license, which is a [[public domain equivalent license]] and a [[waiver]], which allowed individuals to freely reuse, repurpose and [[Remix culture|remix]] photos for their own projects. This was changed in June 2017, and photos are now made available under the Unsplash license, which imposes some additional restrictions.&lt;ref name="Unsplash License"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Unsplash|title=Unsplash License|url=https://unsplash.com/license|website=Unsplash.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsplash received more than 50,000 visits on its first day.&lt;ref name="sideprojects" /&gt;

On 18th February 2018 Unsplash changed their license terms to restrict the sale of photos without first updating, modifying, or otherwise incorporating new creative elements into the photos, prohibiting selling unaltered copies, including selling the photos as prints or printed on physical goods.

While Cho supplied the first batch of Unsplash photos, the site is now sustained by community contributions from amateur and professional photographers. Due to the volume of photo submissions, the site employs an editorial team and “curators” picked from the Unsplash community, including [[Guy Kawasaki]], [[Nas]], [[Khoi Vinh]], [[Amanda Hesser]] and [[Om Malik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Unsplash|title=Unsplash Collections|url=https://unsplash.com/collections|website=Unsplash.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==License==
Unsplash photos are covered by the Unsplash license, which is similar to a [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|Creative Commons zero]] license. The difference between a CC0 license and the Unsplash license is the Unsplash license does not include the right to compile photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unsplash.com/license|title=License {{!}} Unsplash|last=Unsplash|website=unsplash.com|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both licenses give viewers the right to "copy, modify, distribute and use the photos for free, including commercial purposes, without asking permission from or providing attribution to the photographer or Unsplash”&lt;ref name="Unsplash License" /&gt; but the Unsplash licence, prohibits selling unaltered copies, including selling the photos as prints or printed on physical goods. Until June 2017, Unsplash photos were covered by the [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|Creative Commons zero]] license itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://unsplash.com/license |title=Unsplash Licence (May 2017) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530053437/https://unsplash.com/license |archivedate=2017-05-30 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of attribution for Unsplash photos has been the subject of controversy among photography circles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@glimmero/unethical-unsplash-a79ae8d3a5e2|title=Unethical Unsplash|last1=Tyler|first=|date=|website=A Funny Thing Happened|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to some companies using free Unsplash photography for profit without compensating the photographers. Unsplash itself has stated that it does not support the practice.&lt;ref name="Unsplash License" /&gt;

==Book==
In 2016, Unsplash released the Unsplash Book, the world's “first ever fully [[Crowd sourcing|crowd-source]]d” book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ifking|first1=Emma|title=The first fully crowd-sourced open book|url=https://itkey.media/the-first-fully-crowd-sourced-open-book/|website=IT Key Media|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's photos, essays, and funding were all contributed by Unsplash's community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Unsplash|title=Unsplash Book|url=https://book.unsplash.com/|website=Unsplash.com|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book raised $106,000 on [[Kickstarter]] and included contributions from [[Harvard Law School|Harvard law]] professor and CC0 inventor [[Lawrence Lessig]], and designer [[Tobias van Schneider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKay|first1=Jory|title=Want to be a published author?|url=https://crew.co/blog/want-to-be-a-published-author-theres-a-place-for-you-in-the-unsplash-book/|website=Crew Blog|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unsplash API==
In addition to its website, Unsplash provides a public [[Application programming interface]] (API) that powers more than 140 million photo requests per month.&lt;ref name="unsplashapi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Unsplash|title=Unsplash API|url=https://unsplash.com/developers|website=Unsplash.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the products relying on the Unsplash API include Unsplash Instant, an extension for [[Google Chrome]] that loads Unsplash photos in new tabs, Unsplash for [[Apple TV]], and Pablo by Buffer.&lt;ref name="unsplashapi" /&gt;

==Unsplash Local==
Beyond its website and API, Unsplash hosts [[photo walk]]s in cities around the world including Tokyo, Montreal, and Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=TimeOut Toronto|title=Unsplash Toronto Photo Walk|url=https://www.timeout.com/toronto/things-to-do/unsplash-photo-walk-toronto|website=TimeOut|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unsplash.com/history|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=Unsplash|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photo walks are hosted by guides from the Unsplash community who show participants the best places to take photos in their city, how to use their cameras, and how to compose better photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Unsplash|title=Unsplash Local|url=https://unsplash.com/local|website=Unsplash.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1382">'''Varatuomari''' (lit. "vice-judge", Swedish: ''vicehäradshövding'') or '''Master in Law with court training'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lakimiesliitto.fi/julkaisut/muutjulkaisut/lakimiesnimikkeet/  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091910/http://www.lakimiesliitto.fi/julkaisut/muutjulkaisut/lakimiesnimikkeet/ |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''trained on the bench''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] legal title. The degree consists of a [[Master of Laws|master's degree in law]] and one year of [[court]] training as a Trainee District Judge in a [[district court]], usually done very soon after graduation. The title is granted by the local [[Appellate court|appeals court,]] on a recommendation of the chief judge (''[[lawspeaker|laamanni]]''). Thus, it can be considered a specially regulated [[Externship#Legal Externships|legal externship]]. Officially, the degree is no longer a formal requirement to any state office, but it remains a ''[[de facto]]'' requirement for applying into the positions of a [[judge]] or a [[prosecutor]], and is usually held also by [[Defense attorney|defense attorneys]]. It is recognized as a relevant master's degree for purposes of police officer promotions.
