      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3298">'''Aimlessness''' or '''uncommittedness''' or '''wishlessness''' ([[Sanskrit]] ''apraṇihita'' अप्रणिहित) is a form of concentration in some schools of [[Buddhist meditation]]. The concept is particularly associated with the teachings of [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]], who counts aimlessness as the third form of concentration or "Third Door of Liberation".&lt;ref&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh, Rachel Neumann ''Buddha Mind, Buddha Body'' 1427092923 2008 Page 140  "AIMLESSNESS The third concentration is aimlessness, apraṇihita.

==Aimless wandering==
'''Aimless wandering''' refers to both "[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]" (the cycle of birth, death and rebirth) and a mindfulness practice of exploration without destination that often takes the form of a walking [[meditation]] (though it does not require movement). In this practice, attention is paid to one's [[sensory perception]] of the experience rather than one's thoughts about the experience.

[[File:Belisaire demandant l'aumone Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|Giving [[alms]] to the poor is often considered an altruistic action.]]
'''Altruism''' is the [[moral principle|principle]] and [[moral courage|moral practice]] of concern for [[happiness]] of other [[human kind|human beings]] and/or animals, resulting in a [[quality of life]] both [[material]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]]. It is a traditional [[virtue]] in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of "others" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. In Hindu / Sanathana Dharma (whose philosophy is "inclusive", i.e includes, and welcomes everybody), where the dictum "Vasudaiva Kutumbakam" (the world is ONE FAMILY) is in force, always, "others" means "EVERYONE", unconditionally.

In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness which is the opposite of [[selfishness]].

In a common way of living, it doesn't deny the singular nature of the subject, but realizes the traits of the individual [[personality]] in relation to the others, with a true, direct and personal [[interaction]] with each of them. It is focusing both on a single person and the whole [[community]]. In a (not only) Christian practice, it is the law of love direct to the ego and his neighbour.

The word "altruism" was coined by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as ''altruisme'', for an [[antonym]] of [[egoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=altruism (n .)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teske|first1=Nathan|title=Political Activists in America: The Identity Construction Model of Political Participation|date=2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=9780271035468|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7B38I2UEPa0C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived it from the Italian ''altrui'', which in turn was derived from Latin ''alteri'', meaning "[[alterity|other people]]" or "somebody else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ciciloni|first1=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neAGAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another third-party individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is "intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Altruism in medicine: its definition, nature, and dilemmas|last = Steinberg|first = David|date = 2010|journal = Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=249–57|doi = 10.1017/s0963180109990521|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]], in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships. Much debate exists as to whether ''"true"'' altruism is possible in human psychology. The theory of [[psychological egoism]] suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal [[gratification]]. The validity of this argument depends on whether [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic rewards]] qualify as "benefits".

The term ''[[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]'' may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with [[ethical egoism|egoism]], which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first.

==The notion of altruism==
The concept has a long history in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Ethics|ethical]] thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher of science]], [[Auguste Comte]], and has become a major topic for [[psychologists]] (especially [[evolutionary psychology]] researchers), [[evolutionary biologists]], and [[ethology|ethologists]]. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.

==Scientific viewpoints&lt;!--linked from 'Evolution of morality'--&gt;==
===Anthropology===
[[Marcel Mauss]]'s book ''The Gift'' contains a passage called "Note on alms". This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand, and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Evolutionary explanations===

[[File:Manner of Francis Wheatley, Giving alms to beggar children.jpg|thumb|upright|Giving alms to beggar children]]
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.&lt;ref name="Bell2008"&gt;{{cite book| last = Bell| first = Graham| title = Selection: the mechanism of evolution| year = 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 0-19-856972-6| pages = 367–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[evolutionary psychology]] this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, [[Tip (gratuity)|tipping]], courtship gifts, production of [[public good]]s, and [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref name="AEP1"&gt;Pat Barcaly. The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation. In {{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from [[evolutionary game theory]] a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies.

Some of the proposed mechanisms are:
* [[Kin selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biological Altruism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/#2|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Okasha|first=Samir|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures. Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior. One kinship cue is facial resemblance. One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons. Another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare, and this has been found to increase helpful behavior. Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group. Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study. This effect was especially strong for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* Vested interests. People are likely to suffer if their friends, allies, and similar social [[ingroup]]s suffer or even disappear. Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist. Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness. Extreme self-sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] threatens to kill the entire ingroup.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/406755|last1=Trivers|first1=R.L.|year=1971|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|pages=35–57|url=https://www.academia.edu/1591793}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Reciprocity (evolution)]].
** Direct [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.7466396 |author=R Axelrod and WD Hamilton |title=The evolution of cooperation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=211 |issue=4489 |date=27 March 1981 |pages=1390–1396 |pmid=7466396 |bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1390A|citeseerx=10.1.1.147.9644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help. The effective [[tit for tat]] strategy is one [[game theory|game theoretic]] example. Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future. People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower. They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors. Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a "Community Game" instead of a "Wall Street Game."&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them. This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity. Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation. The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts. As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
** Indirect reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature04131|author=Martin Nowak &amp; Karl Sigmund|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=437|issue=27|date=October 2005|pages=1291–1298|pmid=16251955|bibcode = 2005Natur.437.1291N |url=https://www.academia.edu/17949833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a person's [[reputation]] to become very important. A person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
** [[Strong reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gintis |first=Herbert |author-link=Herbert Gintis|title=Strong Reciprocity and Human Sociality|journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]]|volume=206|issue=2|date=September 2000|pmid=10966755|pages=169–179|doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2111|hdl=10419/105717|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism. A number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence.
** Pseudo-reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|title=Genetic and Cultural Evolution of Cooperation, Chapter 11|isbn=0-262-08326-4|publisher=Dahlem Workshop Reports|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist.
* [[Signalling theory|Costly signaling]] and the [[handicap principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/3677205|last1=Zahavi|first1=A.|year=1995|title=Altruism as a handicap – The limitations of kin selection and reciprocity|jstor=3677205|journal=Avian Biol|volume=26|issue=1|pages=1–3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245271476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an "honest signal" of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources. This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner. It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling. It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help. Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits, resources, and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else. Similarly, holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one's resources. Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

[[File:FEMA - 15337 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 09-10-2005 in Texas.jpg|thumb|Volunteers assist Hurricane victims at the [[Houston Astrodome]], following Hurricane Katrina.]]
:Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt; Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.&lt;ref name="AEP2"&gt;Wendy Iredal and Mark van Vugt. Altruism as showing off: a signaling perspective on promoting green behaviour and acts of kindness. In {{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners. When looking for a long-term partner, altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children. It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman. While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man. Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AEP2/&gt;

:People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause [[competitive altruism]]. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as [[psychopathy]] or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Explicit [[extrinsic]] rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Group selection]]. It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as [[David Sloan Wilson]] that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level. Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons. Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also [[in-group favoritism]]). Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Neyfakh

[[File:Helping the homeless (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Helping the [[Homelessness|homeless]] in New York City]]
Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their [[inclusive fitness]] when they are doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]], which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides.'' These protists live as individual [[amoeba]]e until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.

Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1701_01 |last1=Brown |first1=S.L. |last2=Brown |first2=R.M. |year=2006 |title=Selective investment theory: Recasting the functional significance of close relationships |url=http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/Brown-Stephanie.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714230521/http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/Brown-Stephanie.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-07-14 |format=PDF |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=17 |pages=1–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icts.res.in/media/uploads/Talk/Document/StLouis2011TelmoFIN.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902 book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' and [[Peter Singer]] in his book ''[[A Darwinian Left]].''

===Neurobiology===
Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. In their research, published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA in October 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Human fronto–mesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation, PNAS 2006:103(42);15623–15628&lt;/ref&gt; they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/[[septal region]]. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;{{cite news

In fact, in an experiment published in March 2007 at the [[University of Southern California]] neuroscientist [[Antonio R. Damasio]] and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that When confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with "end-justifies-the-means" answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue - in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city - these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to [[Adrian Raine]], a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study's implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: "Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets. Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?"&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;

In another study, in the 1990s, Dr. Bill Harbaugh, a [[University of Oregon]] economist, concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fMRI scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist colleague Dr. Ulrich Mayr, reached the same conclusions of Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman about giving to charity, although they were able to divide the study group into two groups: "egoists" and "altruists". One of their discoveries was that, though rarely, even some of the considered "egoists" sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others, leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity, such as a person's environment and values.&lt;ref name="neurons"/&gt;

===Psychology===
The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines ''psychological altruism'' as "a motivational state with the goal of increasing another’s welfare." Psychological altruism is contrasted with ''psychological egoism,'' which refers to the motivation to increase one's own welfare.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;["Altruism." International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Ed. William A. Darity, Jr. 2nd ed. Vol. 1. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2008. 87-88. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 10 April 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism.&lt;ref name="batson3"&gt;[Batson, C. (2011). Altruism in humans. New York, NY US: Oxford University Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name="prosocial"&gt;[Batson, C. (2012). A history of prosocial behavior research. In A. W. Kruglanski, [[Wolfgang Stroebe|W. Stroebe]], A. W. Kruglanski, (Eds.), Handbook of the history of social psychology (pp. 243–264). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The [[social exchange theory]] postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self.&lt;ref name="noaltruism"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maner | first1 = J.

He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle ([[principlism]]). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless.&lt;ref name=" baston2"&gt;[Batson, C., Ahmad, N., &amp; Stocks, E. L. (2011). Four forms of prosocial motivation: Egoism, altruism, collectivism, and principlism. In D. Dunning, D. Dunning (Eds.), Social motivation (pp. 103–126). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis'' basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Svetlova|first1=M.|last2=Nichols|first2=S.

In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service.&lt;ref name="prosocial"/&gt; Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the ''[[Bystander effect]]''). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson | first1 = James M. | last2 = Bruckman | first2 = Amy S. | year = 2004 | title = The Bystander Effect: A Lens for Understanding Patterns of Participation | url = | journal = Journal of the Learning Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 165–195 | doi = 10.1207/s15327809jls1302_2 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.72.4881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness.&lt;ref name="volunteer5"/&gt; For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant).&lt;ref name="overwhelmed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=C.|last2=Meisenhelder|first2=J.|last3=Ma|first3=Y.|last4=Reed|first4=G.|year=2003|title=Altruistic Social Interest Behaviors Are Associated With Better Mental Health|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=65|issue=5|pages=778–785|doi=10.1097/01.PSY.0000079378.39062.D4|pmid=14508020|citeseerx=10.1.1.529.7780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, while generous acts make people feel good about themselves, it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others. Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being.

===Sociology===
"Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity". American Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/sections/altruism.cfm American Sociological Association: Altruism, Morality and Social Solidarity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503051933/http://asanet.org/sections/altruism.cfm |date=3 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges [[Public sociology]] saying, "The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity" ASA). This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and "build the good society". The motivation of altruism is also the focus of study; some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims.&lt;ref&gt;Thulin EW, Bicchieri C.

===Pathological altruism===
[[Pathology|Pathological]] altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme, and either harms the altruistic person, or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good.

The term "pathological altruism" was popularised by the book ''[[Pathological Altruism]]''.

Examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid.&lt;ref&gt;http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199738571.do&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious viewpoints==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}
Most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Sikhism]], etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.

===Buddhism===
[[File:Monks collecting alms - Bun Vat Phu.JPG|thumb|Monks collecting alms]]
Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. "Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being" ([[Dalai Lama]]).&lt;ref name="Speech by the Dalai Lama"&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm Speech by the Dalai Lama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003223717/http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm |date=3 October 2009 }}&lt;br&gt;The phrase "core of our being" is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: "The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes" (Dalai Lama&lt;ref name="Speech by the Dalai Lama"/&gt;).

In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.

===Jainism===
{{see also|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Ahinsa.jpg|thumb|Sculpture depicting the Jain concept of ''ahimsa'' (non-injury)]]
The fundamental principles of [[Jainism]] revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of ''[[Ahimsa]]'' – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabhdev]], introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.

Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment.

Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:
# Non-violence (Ahimsa);
# Truthfulness (Satya);
# Non-stealing (Asteya);
# Celibacy ([[Brahmacharya]]);
# [[Non-possession]] or non-materialism (Aparigraha);
The "great vows" ([[Mahavrata]]) are prescribed for monks and "limited vows" ([[Anuvrata]]) are prescribed for householders. The house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows. The monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.

The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become ''Siddha'' ([[God in Jainism]]). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.

===Christianity===
[[File:StThomasMount Theresa.JPG|thumb|Statue of [[Mother Teresa]] in India]]
Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the [[Gospel]], especially in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. From biblical to medieval [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of "disinterested love", as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase "love seeks not its own interests." In his book ''Indoctrination and Self-deception,'' Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.

[[St Thomas Aquinas]] interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself'&lt;ref&gt;[[Leviticus]] 19 and Matthew 22&lt;/ref&gt; as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'', II:II Quaestio 25, Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship" and quotes Aristotle that "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] IX.4 1166a1&lt;/ref&gt; he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.

Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God. [[Thomas Jay Oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.

German philosopher [[Max Scheler]] distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, "motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way is merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], the concept 'ithaar' (إيثار) (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by ALLAH on the human body, considered to be property of ALLAH alone. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; [[Islam]] considers those practicing Eyaar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = M| title = Key Concepts in the Practice of Sufism: Emerald Hills of the Heart| year = 2004| publisher = Fountain| location = Rutherford, N.J.| isbn = 1-932099-75-1| pages = 10–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for [[ALLAH]] (i.e. God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.&lt;ref name="Neusner2005"&gt;{{cite book| last = Neusner| first = Jacob Eds| title = Altruism in World Religions| year = 2005| publisher = Georgetown Univ. Press| location = Washington, D.C.| isbn = 1-58901-065-5| pages = 79–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like [[Rabia al-Adawiyya]] who paid attention to the difference between dedication to [[ALLAH]] (i.e. God) and dedication to people. Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet [[Yunus Emre]] explained this philosophy as "Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü" or ''We love the creature, because of The Creator.'' For many Muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays. However, i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times.

===Judaism===
Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author2=Ben Zion Bokser |last1=Kook |first1=Abraham Isaac| title = Abraham Isaac Kook: The lights of penitence, The moral principles, Lights of holiness, essays, letters, and poems| year = 1978| publisher = Paulist Press| isbn = 978-0-8091-2159-5| pages = 135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is defined as [[Tzedakah|bestowal]], or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. [[Kabbalah]] defines God as the force of giving in [[existence]]. Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Luzzatto| first = Moshe Ḥayyim| title = The way of God| year = 1997| publisher = Feldheim Publishers| isbn = 978-0-87306-769-0| pages = 37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 120–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 175–180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness. The concept of [[selfless service|"seva]]," or selfless service to the community for its own sake is an important concept in Sihkism. &lt;ref name=DictofSikhism&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/APopularDictionaryOfSikhism/page/n38 |title=A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism |publisher=''Curzon Press''|author=Cole, W. Owen and Sambhi, Piara Singh |pages=38-39, 84 |date=1990|accessdate=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev, sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth. The ninth Guru, Tegh Bahadur, sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. In the late seventeenth century, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji (the tenth [[guru]] in Sikhism), was in war with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh, [[Bhai Kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy.&lt;ref name=GobindSingh&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofthesikh025030mbp/page/n7 |title=A History Of The Sikhs |publisher=''Oxford University Press''|author= Joseph Davey Cunningham |date=1918 |page=ix |accessdate=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield."What were you doing, and why?" asked the Guru. "I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them," replied Bhai Kanhaiya. The Guru responded, "Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru."

It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = O. P. Ralhan| title = The great gurus of the Sikhs| year = 1997| publisher = Anmol Publications Pvt Ltd.| location = New Delhi| isbn = 81-7488-479-3| page = 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism Selflessness (Atmatyag), Love (Prema), Kindness (Daya) and Forgiveness (Kshama) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or "Manushyattva". Giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as a divine act or "Punya" and Hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or "Paapa" and will led them to heaven or "Swarga" in afterlife. Altruism is also the central act of various Hindu mythology and religious poems and songs.

[[Swami Vivekananda]], the legendary Hindu monk, has said -"Jive prem kare jeijon, Seijon sebiche Iswar" (Whoever loves any living being, is serving god.). Mass donation of clothes to poor people (Vastraseva), or blood donation camp or mass food donation (Annaseva) for poor people is common in various Hindu religious ceremonies.

[[Swami Sivananda]], an [[Advaita]] scholar, reiterates the views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the [[Brahma Sutras]], a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[Merit (Buddhism)|punya]], which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.

However the very well known and popular text, the [[Bhagavad Gita]] supports the doctrine of karma yoga (achieving oneness with God through action) &amp; "nishkaama karma" or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism. Altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8'', Sutras 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{main|Altruism (ethics)}}

There exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical altruism]] maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is [[ethical egoism]], which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with [[utilitarianism]], which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.

A related concept in [[descriptive ethics]] is [[psychological egoism]], the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. [[Rational egoism]] is the view that [[rationality]] consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).

==Genetics==
The genes [[OXTR]], [[CD38]], [[COMT]], [[DRD4]], [[DRD5]], [[IGF2]], [[GABRB2]] have been found to be candidate genes for altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3871336 | pmid=24132092 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2013.0395 | volume=9 | title=Genes underlying altruism | year=2013 | journal=Biol Lett | page=20130395 | last1 = Thompson | first1 = GJ | last2 = Hurd | first2 = PL | last3 = Crespi | first3 = BJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ascribed characteristics''', as used in the [[social sciences]], refers to properties of an individual attained at birth, by inheritance, or through the aging process. The individual has very little, if any, control over these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology: A Global Perspective|last=Ferrante|first=Joan|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples include race, ethnicity, gender, caste, height, and appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population : an introduction to concepts and issues|last=Weeks|first=John Robert|publisher=Cenage|year=|isbn=9781305094505|edition=Twelfth|location=Boston, MA|pages=|oclc=884617656}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term is apt for describing characteristics chiefly caused by "nature" (e.g. genetics) and for those chiefly caused by "nurture" (e.g. parenting during early childhood), See: [[Nature versus nurture|Nature versus Nurture]].

== Use Within Demography ==

Demography being the statistical study of populations requires the ability to differentiate between populations. Most populations self-ascribe themselves as being different than another by the creation of a country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/creation-israel|title=Milestones: 1945–1952 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This allows Demographers to draw lines between countries and compare them. However useful, countries have significant complex populations that require more exacting definitions. Commonly seen are uses of [[Race (human categorization)|Race]], [[Gender]] and [[Ethnicity]]. In the scope of academic demography, all of these are [[Social construction of gender|Social Constructs]], '''ASCRIBED''' to groups or individuals for Stratification &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/06/16/how-fluid-is-racial-identity/race-and-racial-identity-are-social-constructs|title=Race and Racial Identity Are Social Constructs|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender roles : a sociological perspective|last=Lindsey|first=Linda|isbn=9780205899685|edition=Sixth|location=Boston|oclc=892213147|date = December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With these [[Theory|theories]] in place, many new theories can be formed and data collected to either prove or disprove them. Ascribed characteristics can have large by-products weather perceived or not. Discussed below are Race, Gender, [[Social status|Social Status]] / [[Caste]] and Hiring / Promotion.

=== Race ===
Ascribed characteristics are not always used for academic purposes. People with certain ascribed characteristics can be systematically treated with prejudice. Thus, the study of [[racism]] can be seen, at least superficially, as the study of the ways that people with a certain skin color and cultural background are systematically treated differently by society at large&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discourse and Discrimination: Rhetorics Of Racism and Antisemitism|last=Resigl|first=Martin|last2=Wodak|first2=Ruth|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Race does not entirely have a 

=== Gender ===
[https://www.uu.nl/staff/fvantubergen/0 Frank van Tubergen] studied the how ascribed characteristics and achieved characteristics effect their [[Social capital|Social Capital]] in the article ''Personal networks in Saudi Arabia: The role of ascribed and achieved characteristics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Tubergen|first=Frank|last2=Al-Modaf|first2=Obaid Ali|last3=Almosaed|first3=Nora F.|last4=Al-Ghamdi|first4=Mohammed Ben Said|title=Personal networks in Saudi Arabia: The role of ascribed and achieved characteristics|journal=Social Networks|volume=45|pages=45–54|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2015.10.007|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The article highlighted that women have less social capital than men in [[Saudi Arabia]] citing specifically that it was "due to fewer non-family connections". There are many arguments that stem from disagreements over the definition of what is a fact when it comes to gender, showing the fluidity of ascribed characteristics. For example, people who find [[homosexuality]] morally objectionable may attempt to justify this by insisting that homosexuals make a conscious decision about the nature of the sexual desire they experience however, it would difficult to condemn homosexuality if homosexuality was predetermined, either genetically or from early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Q|last2=Wilson|first2=G.D|year=2003|title=Sexual orientation and the 2nd to 4th finger length ratio: evidence for organising effects of sex hormones or developmental instability?|url=|journal=International Society of Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=28|pages=288–303|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Sexual orientation]].). Both Groups do however use the term all the same, simply '''ascribing''' different definitions to those individuals.

=== Social Status / Caste ===
Many different societies have had varying types of social stratification both historically and in the modern era. One of the most obvious examples is [[India]], and its [[Caste system in India|Caste System]]. In its essence, it was a system that ascribed sweepers the lowest status, making this one group literally untouchable. Although India officially states that discrimination against lower castes is illegal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/CII2011/cii-2011/Chapter%207.pdf][http://www.ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/CII2011/cii-2011/Chapter%207.pdf CRIME AGAINST PERSONS BELONGING TO SCs / STs]'''Government of India, National Crime Records Bureau''' (2011), page 108&lt;/ref&gt;.   

=== Hiring / Promotion ===

[[Ronald P. Dore]] was a British sociologist that was a specialist in the Japanese Economy. His view will be expressed here. In his largest work, ''British Factory, Japanese Factory''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British factory, Japanese factory : the origins of national diversity in industrial relations|last=Dore|first=Ronald|date=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520024953|location=Berkeley|pages=|oclc=20130326}}&lt;/ref&gt; , Dore investigates whether decisions on hiring and promotion, in the Japanese firm Hitachi, over a particular time were based chiefly on "achievement" or chiefly on "ascribed characteristics". The context of the discussion implied that achievement-based decisions are good, while those based on ascribed characteristics are bad. His discussion admits explicitly and, implicitly, that there are several complications to moral judgement that include:

* Some achievement characteristics are positively correlated with some ascribed characteristics such as intelligence and socioeconomic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strenze|first=Tarmo|date=2007-09-01|title=Intelligence and socioeconomic success: A meta-analytic review of longitudinal research|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289606001127|journal=Intelligence|volume=35|issue=5|pages=401–426|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "the power to command...may be much more likely to be bred in upper class families" to the extent that "the power to command" is viewed as a measure of merit. Promotion decisions favoring high merit would not be entirely distinguishable from making promotion decisions favoring high class thus, it can be difficult, to tell whether a particular promotion decision has been made for just or unjust reasons.
* It is possible to, "irrelevantly acquire discriminatory characteristics", or even do so intentionally. For example, by converting to a new religion or getting married. 
* It is reasonable to view even some ascribed characteristics as factors that should affect employee compensation. In Hitachi, for example, pay is positively correlated both with performance and with age. The latter is an ascribed characteristic, but Dore suggests that it is a perfectly reasonable consideration, especially since expenses such as childcare, tend to increase over the duration of employment at Hitachi.

Dore also points out that what counts as an ascribed characteristic can vary depending on context. In evaluating the fairness of hiring standards, he viewed an applicant's success in the educational system as a good approximation of achievement. Thus, he noted that hiring decisions at Hitachi, during the time of his study, were "regulated by very strict qualification standards" and not very significantly influenced by ascribed characteristics. When he turned to evaluate opportunities for advancement within the firm, however, Dore noted that "educational qualifications...limit the range of posts which one can achieve". Meaning even if one's level of achievement increases, one may still be kept down by a relative lack of achievement in the educational system. Therefore, in investigating opportunities for promotions, educational achievement " the two become another form of ascribed characteristic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hearn|first=James C.|title=Attendance at higher-cost colleges: Ascribed, socioeconomic, and academic influences on student enrollment patterns|journal=Economics of Education Review|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=65–76|doi=10.1016/0272-7757(88)90072-6|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additional forms of ascribed characteristics expand on the definition of an ascribed characteristic allowing for it to have more applications.

'''Black Girl Magic''' (#BlackGirlMagic) is a concept and movement that was popularized by CaShawn Thompson in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Dexter|title=Why everyone's saying 'Black Girls are Magic'|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-everyones-saying-black-girls-are-magic-20150909-htmlstory.html|accessdate=3 September 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was born as a way to "celebrate the beauty, power and resilience of black women", as described by Julee Wilson from ''[[HuffPost]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Julee|title=The Meaning Of #BlackGirlMagic, And How You Can Get Some Of It|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-black-girl-magic-video_us_5694dad4e4b086bc1cd517f4|accessdate=3 September 2016|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to congratulate black women on their accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Ali|first1=Rasha|title= What Is Black Girl Magic?

Though born online, the movement has inspired many organizations across the world to host events using the title.

In 2016, poet [[Mahogany L. Browne]] created a [[poetry slam|slam poetry]] piece entitled "Black Girl Magic".&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/poet-mahogany-l-browne-on-black-girl-magic|title=Poet Mahogany L. Browne on ‘black girl magic’|date=February 25, 2016|work=[[PBS NewsHour]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==

===Hashtag===

In 2013, Thompson coined the phrase via the [[hashtag]] #BlackGirlsAreMagic— now shortened to #BlackGirlMagic—to create an online dialogue centered around the achievements of black women, in a society that has historically recognized very few of these achievements.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Since being popularized, one can find the hashtag being used on [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and other social media and mainstream media platforms, celebrating positive messages and images of black women all across the globe.

=== Clothing campaign===

In January 2014, Thompson began selling t-shirts sporting the "Black Girls Are Magic" logo that she created with her friend.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; At the time, Thompson only meant to sell these shirts to her friends and family, but has since sold over 3,000 T-shirts through her Teespring account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= D'Oyley|first1=Demetria Lucas|title= Elle, You Just Don’t Understand #BlackGirlMagic.|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2016/01/elle_you_just_don_t_understand_blackgirlmagic/|accessdate=30 November 2016|work=TheWrap|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the popularity of the shirts started among active social media users, Thompson was quickly surprised to see that people were also buying them as gifts for granddaughters, daughters, and nieces, as they felt that the message was encouraging for young girls too.

The shirts have also gained some celebrity recognition, with prominent young black women such as [[Willow Smith]] and [[Amandla Stenberg]] posting pictures of themselves on various social media platforms wearing their Black Girls Are Magic gear.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Philosophy==

"I say 'magic' because it's something that people don't always understand," Thompson told [[Los Angeles Times|''The Los Angeles Times'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-everyones-saying-black-girls-are-magic-20150909-htmlstory.html|title=Why everyone's saying 'Black Girls are Magic'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to explain how "Sometimes our accomplishments might seem to come out of thin air, because a lot of times, the only people supporting us are other black women." At its core, the purpose of this movement is to create a platform where women of color can stand together against the [[stereotyping]], [[colourism]], [[misogynoir]] and [[racism]] that is often their lived experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Controversy==

As its usage has grown, the concept has also drawn criticism.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

==="Black girls aren't magic. We're human." ===

While many black women support the concept of Black Girl Magic, some{{who?|date=November 2017}} feel it reinforces the "strong black woman" [[archetype]] that black women often confront. In an article for [[Elle (magazine)|Elle Magazine]], Linda Chavers argued that the movement suggests that black women are superhuman, or something other than human.&lt;ref name= ":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1= Chavers|first1=Linda|title= Here's My Problem With #BlackGirlMagic|url=http://www.elle.com/life-love/a33180/why-i-dont-love-blackgirlmagic//|accessdate=6 November 2016|work=Elle Magazine|date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to explain how, historically, black women have been seen and treated as subhuman beings, and how the image of black women persevering despite her suffering, is the epitome of the strong black woman type that is often celebrated while simultaneously being criticized in today's culture.&lt;ref name= ":2"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 2016, Black Girl Magic Ltd was established as an [[nonprofit organization]] in an attempt to create a legacy and continuity throughout the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10477476|title=BLACK GIRL MAGIC LTD - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10678">[[File:Buttered cat.png|thumb|A cartoon illustration of the [[thought experiment]]]]

The '''buttered cat paradox''' is a common joke based on the [[tongue-in-cheek]] combination of two [[adage]]s:

* [[Cat righting reflex|Cats always land on their feet]].
* Buttered toast always lands [[Buttered toast phenomenon|buttered side down]].

The [[paradox]] arises when one considers what would happen if one attached a piece of buttered toast (butter side up) to the back of a cat, then dropped the cat from a large height. The buttered cat paradox, submitted by artist [[John Frazee]] of [[Kingston, New York]], won a 1993 ''[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]]'' magazine competition about paradoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Scot |date=July 1993 |title=I have a theory... |magazine=Omni |url=http://www.housevampyr.com/training/library/books/omni/OMNI_1993_07.pdf |page=96 |volume=15 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verley |first=Jason C. |date=November 2001 |title=Letters: More on Alternate Theories |magazine=APS News |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200111/letters.cfm |volume=10 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic premise, stating the conditions of the cat and bread and posed as a question, was presented in a routine by comic and juggler [[Michael Davis (juggler)|Michael Davis]], appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]'', July 22, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq0YjR11bx8 ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'', July 22, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thought experiments ==
Some people jokingly maintain that the experiment will produce an [[anti-gravity]] effect.  They propose that as the cat falls towards the ground, it will slow down and start to rotate, eventually reaching a [[steady state]] of hovering a short distance from the ground while rotating at high speed as both the buttered side of the toast and the cat’s feet attempt to land on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/fmd/newsletter/Newsletter_No14.pdf |title=UoWaikato newsletter |format=PDF |date=August 2003 |publisher=University of Waikato |accessdate=2012-06-20 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2003, Kimberly Miner won a [[Student Academy Award]] for her film ''Perpetual Motion''.&lt;ref&gt;Available at http://www.kminer.net/2011/07/perpetual-motion/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202085129/http://www.kminer.net/2011/07/perpetual-motion/# |date=2015-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifidimensions.com/Apr04/oscaranimation.htm |title=Oscar Nominated Animated Shorts 2003 |publisher=Scifidimensions.com |date=2004 |first=John C. |last=Snider |accessdate=2012-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204063041/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Apr04/oscaranimation.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miner based her film on a paper written by a high-school friend that explored the potential implications of the cat and buttered toast idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=PG |last=Klein |website=[[University of Leeds]], School of Physics &amp; Astronomy |url=http://www.physics.leeds.ac.uk/pages/PerpetualMotion |title=Perpetual Motion |date=2002-12-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022204806/http://www.physics.leeds.ac.uk/pages/PerpetualMotion |archivedate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rit.edu/success.php?s=43 |title=Student wins Academy Award for animated film |website=[[Rochester Institute of Technology]] |date=Spring 2004 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In humor ==
The faux paradox has captured the imagination of science-oriented [[humorist]]s.  In May 1992, the [[Internet Oracle|Usenet Oracle]] Digest #441 included a question from a supplicant asking about the paradox.&lt;ref name=oracle&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Internet Oracle|Usenet Oracle]] |url=http://internetoracle.org/digest.cgi?N=441#441-07 |title=Usenet Oracularities #441 |date=1992-05-04 |editor-first1=Steve |editor-last=Kinzler |editor-link=Steve Kinzler |author=Usenet Oracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Testing the theory is the main theme in an episode of the [[comic book]] strip ''[[Jack B. Quick]]'', the title character seeks to test this theory, leading to the cat hovering above the ground, with the cat's wagging tail providing propulsion.  The March 31, 2005, strip of the [[webcomic]] ''[[Bunny (webcomic)|Bunny]]'' also explored the idea in the guise of a plan for a "Perpetual Motion MoggieToast 5k Power Generator", based on [[Sod's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunny-comic.com/211.html |title=Feline cunning and sods law |work=[[Bunny (webcomic)]] |first=Huw "Lem" |last=Davies |number=211 |date=2005-03-31 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Science Askew'', Donald E. Simanek comments on this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="SimanekHolden2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simanek |first1=Donald E. |last2=Holden |first2=John C. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Science Askew: A Light-hearted Look at the Scientific World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldX0FkgurzoC&amp;pg=PA201 |accessdate=2010-06-30 |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-7503-0714-7 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea appeared on the British [[panel game]] ''[[QI]]'', where the idea was discussed. As well as talking about the idea, they also brought up other questions regarding the paradox. These included:
*"Would it still work if you used [[margarine]]?",
*"Would it still work if you used [[I Can't Believe It's Not Butter]]?", and
*"What if the toast was covered in something that was not butter, but the cat thought it was butter?" (the idea being that it would act like a [[placebo]]).&lt;ref name="QI"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Hypothetical |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/episodes/8/8/ |series=QI |serieslink=QI |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |location=London |airdate=2010-11-05 |seriesno=H |number=8 |first1=Sandi |last1=Toksvig |first2=Johnny |last2=Vegas |first3=John |last3=Lloyd |last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paradox also appeared in the episode "Gravitational Anarchy" of the scientific podcast ''[[Radiolab]]''.&lt;ref name="Radiolab"&gt;{{cite episode |url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/102525-vertigo/ |title=Gravitational Anarchy |series=[[Radiolab]] |network=[[NPR]] |time=20:48 |date=2010-11-29 |accessdate=2015-01-11 |first1=Robert |last1=Krulwich |authorlink1=Robert Krulwich |first2=Jad |last2=Abumrad |authorlink2=Jad Abumrad |first3=David (guest) |last3=Quammen |authorlink3=David Quammen |first4=Neil (guest) |last4=deGrasse Tyson |authorlink4=Neil deGrasse Tyson |last-author-amp=yes}} [https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/wnycs-radiolab/id152249110 Alternate link] via [[iTunes]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a humoristic explainer animation&lt;ref name="The Cat and Jelly Toast Experiment"&gt;{{cite web |author=[http://www.barqvideo.com barqvideo] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7Is22CmY_Y |title=The Cat and Jelly Toast Experiment aka the Buttered Cat Paradox explainer |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was put together by the animated production company Barq, based on an extracted audio clip from the ''Radiolab'' episode.

It also appeared in a comics series called ''[[Kid Paddle]]'' where Kid tells the story to his gullible friend Horace while at the dinner table. The comic is fairly popular in France and Belgium.

== In reality ==
In reality, cats possess the ability to turn themselves right side up in mid-air if they should fall upside-down, known as the [[cat righting reflex]]. This enables them to land on their feet if dropped from sufficient height, about {{Convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/ |title=How does a Cat always land on its feet? |first=Huy D. |last=Nguyen |date=1998 |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Medical Engineering |accessdate=2014-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010410235503/http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/ |archivedate=2001-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toast, being an inanimate object, lacks both the ability and the desire to right itself. A study at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] involving dropping 100 slices under laboratory conditions established that toast typically lands on the floor butter-side-down as a result of the manner in which it is typically dropped from a table, and the aerodynamic drag caused by the air pockets within the bread. The toast is typically butter-side-up when dropped. As it falls, it rotates; given the typical speed of rotation and the typical height of a table, a slice of toast that began butter-side-up on the table will land butter-side-down on the floor in 81% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/-rav--r-manchester-boffins-5842879 |title=(-Rav)/ t = R: Manchester boffins find formula for why toast lands butter side down |first=Chris |last=Slater|newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2017-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Otis Whitman''' (December 6, 1842 – December 14, 1910) was an American [[zoologist]], who was influential to the founding of classical [[ethology]].&lt;ref&gt;Danchin. Behavioural Ecology. pp.16&lt;/ref&gt; A dedicated educator who preferred to teach a few research students at a time, he made major contributions in the areas of [[evolution]] and [[embryology]] of worms, [[comparative anatomy]], [[heredity]], and [[ethology|animal behaviour]]. He was known as the "Father of Zoology" in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/charles-otis-whitman-1842-1910 Charles Otis Whitman (1842-1910)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Charles_Otis_Whitman.png|thumb|220px|Charles Otis Whitman]]
Whitman was born in [[Woodstock, Maine]]. His parents were [[Adventism|Adventist]] [[pacifism|pacifist]]s and prevented his efforts to enlist in the Union army in 1862. He worked as a part-time teacher and converted to [[Unitarianism]]. He graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] in 1868. Following graduation, Whitman became principal of the Westford Academy, a small Unitarian-oriented college preparatory school outside [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. In 1872 he moved to [[Boston]] and after becoming a member of the [[Boston Society of Natural History]] in 1874, he decided to study zoology full-time. In 1875, he took a leave of absence and went to the [[University of Leipzig]] in Germany to complete a Ph.D. which he obtained in 1878.
[[File:Ectopistes migratoriusMCN2P28CA.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Drawing of a [[passenger pigeon]] from one of Whitman's books]]
A year later he received a postdoctoral fellowship at the [[Johns Hopkins University]], but immediately gave it up when after recommended by noted biologist [[Edward Sylvester Morse]], he was [[oyatoi gaikokujin|hired by the Japanese government]] to succeed Morse as professor at the [[Tokyo Imperial University]] from 1879-1881. Influenced by his training in Germany, he introduced systematic methods of biological research, including the use of the [[microscope]].

After leaving Japan, Whitman performed research at the [[Naples Zoological Station]] (1882), became an assistant at the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]], [[Harvard University]] (1883–5), then directed the Allis Lake Laboratory, in [[Milwaukee]] (1886–9), where he founded the ''[[Journal of Morphology]]'' (1887).

In 1884, Whitman married Emily Nunn. He moved to [[Clark University]] ([[Worcester, Massachusetts]]) (1889–92), then became a professor and curator of the Zoological Museum at the [[University of Chicago]] (1892–1910),&lt;ref&gt;Dugatkin. The Altruism Equation. pp.38&lt;/ref&gt; while concurrently serving as founding director of the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]] (1888–1908).&lt;ref&gt;Sapp. Genesis: The Evolution of Biology. pp.84&lt;/ref&gt;   During the 1880s, Whitman established himself as the central figure of academic biology in the United States. He systematized the procedures that European anatomists and zoologists had gradually developed over the past two decades.

Over the course of his career, Whitman worked with more than 700 species of [[pigeon]]s, studying the relationship between phenotypic variation and heredity. By the turn of the 20th century, the last group of [[passenger pigeons]], all descended from the same pair, was kept by Whitman at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="Rothschild"&gt;{{Cite book

In December 1910, however, he caught a chill and died a few days later.

Whitman was a non-Darwinian [[evolutionist]]. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] wrote that Whitman did not believe in [[Lamarckism]], [[Darwinism]] or [[mutationism]], instead Whitman was an advocate of [[orthogenesis]]. Whitman only wrote one book on orthogenesis which was published nine years after his death in 1919 titled ''Orthogenetic evolution in pigeons'' the book was published in a three volume set titled ''Posthumous Works of Charles Otis Whitman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2456225|last1 = Castle|first1 = W.

{{For|the term in media studies|Concision (media studies)}}
{{Redirect|Succinct}}
'''Concision''' (alternatively '''brevity''', '''laconicism''', '''terseness''', or '''conciseness''') is the cutting out of unnecessary words while conveying an idea. It aims to enhance communication by eliminating [[redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] without omitting important information. Concision has been described as one of the elementary principles of writing.&lt;ref name="tEoS"&gt;{{cite book |author=William Strunk |title=The Elements of Style |year=1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related concept of '''succinctness''' is the opposite of [[verbosity]].

==Description==
Concision means to be economical with words, expressing what's needed using the fewest words necessary.&lt;ref name="Concision"&gt;"What is Concision?" Accessed February 4, 2017. [https://concision.co.uk/concision/ Link.]&lt;/ref&gt; That may involve removing redundant or unnecessary phrases or replacing them with shorter ones. It is described in ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' by [[Strunk and White]] as follows:&lt;ref name="tEoS"/&gt;

{{quote|Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.|Elementary Principles of Composition, ''The Elements of Style''}}

Concision has also been described as "eliminat[ing] words that take up space without saying much."&lt;ref name="Boulder"&gt;Program for Writing and Rhetoric, University of Colorado at Boulder. "Writing Tip #27: Revising for Concision and Clarity." Accessed June 19, 2012. [http://www.colorado.edu/pwr/writingtips/27.html Link.]&lt;/ref&gt; Simple examples include replacing "{{sic|due to the fact that}}" with "because" or "at this point in time" with "now" or "currently."&lt;ref name="UNT"&gt;UNT Writing Lab. "Concision, Clarity, and Cohesion." Accessed June 19, 2012. [http://www.unt.edu/writinglab/UNTOWL_Concision_Clarity_and_Cohesion.pdf Link.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example sentence, with explanation:&lt;ref name="Boulder"/&gt;

{{quote|'''"It is a fact that most arguments must try to convince readers, that is the audience, that the arguments are true."''' Notice the beginning of the sentence: "it is a fact that" doesn't say much; if something is a fact, just present it. So begin the sentence with "most arguments..." and turn to the next bit of overlap. Look at "readers, that is the audience"; the redundancy can be reduced to "readers" or "audience." Now we have "Most arguments must try to convince readers that the arguments are true." Let's get rid of one of the "arguments" to produce '''"Most arguments must demonstrate (their) truth to readers,"''' or a similarly straightforward expression.}}

==Example paragraph==
The following example is taken from:&lt;ref name="UNT"/&gt;

{{quote|The author of the poem illustrated various differences between the characters. The poem, which was a [[romantic poem]], showed that each individual character was sort of devious in the way in which he or she did things and behaved. The two characters in the poem, who were named Jim and Dwight, were never definitely and completely honest with each other, which led to the final outcome of them being unhappy. This outcome, which was undesirable, is designed in a way to show the readers just exactly how the author feels about lying and deceit.}}

The source suggests this replacement:

{{quote|The romantic poem showed that its characters were devious. Jim and Dwight, the poem’s two characters, were never honest with each other and ended up unhappy. This undesirable outcome shows the readers how the author feels about lying.}}

In the second quote, the same information is communicated in less than half the length. However, it could be more concisely rewritten and communicate the same information:

{{quote|The romantic poem’s characters, Jim and Dwight, were dishonest with each other and ended up unhappy, showing the author's feelings about lying.}}

==Teaching concise expression==
Concise expression, particularly in writing, is considered one of the basic goals of teaching the English language.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Buczynski, Kristin Fontichiaro, ''Story Starters and Science Notebooking: Developing Student Thinking Through Literacy and Inquiry'' (2009), p. 7, {{ISBN|1591586860}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques to achieve concise writing are taught for students at all levels, from the introduction to writing to the preparation of PhD dissertations,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, ''Authoring a PhD: How to Plan, Draft, Write and Finish a Doctoral Thesis or Dissertation'' (2003), p. 273, {{ISBN|023036800X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and legal writing for law students.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Writing Institute, ''Legal Writing: The Journal of the Legal Writing Institute'' (2002), Vol. 7, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that although "in expository prose English places a high value on conciseness... [t]he value placed on conciseness... is not shared by all cultures", with, for example, the [[Thai culture]] as one where redundancy is prized as an opportunity to use additional words to demonstrate the writer's command of the language.&lt;ref name="Pacific Rim"&gt;Mark Newell Brock, Larry Walters, ''Teaching Composition Around the Pacific Rim: Politics and Pedagogy'' (1992), p. 4-5, {{ISBN|1853591602}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This may lead to a tendency for people from those cultures to use repetitive or redundant phrasing when learning English.&lt;ref name="Pacific Rim"/&gt;

==Succinctness==
The related concept of '''succinctness''' is a characteristic of [[Plain language|speech]],&lt;ref name=Garner2009b&gt;{{cite book | last1=Garner| first1=Bryan A.| author1-link=Bryan A. Garner| title=[[Garner on Language and Writing]]: Selected Essays and Speeches of Bryan A.

It is the opposite of verbosity, in which there is an excess of words.

Brevity in succinctness is not achieved by shortening original material by [[code|coding]] or [[Data compression|compressing]] it, but rather by omitting [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundant]] material from it.

The '''culture of violence theory''' addresses the pervasiveness of specific violent patterns within in a societal dimension.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galtung|first=Johan|date=2016-07-01|title=Cultural Violence|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343390027003005|journal=Journal of Peace Research|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|pages=291–305|doi=10.1177/0022343390027003005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of violence being ingrained in Western society and culture has been around for at least the past century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Developed from [[structural violence]], as research progressed the notion that a culture can sanction violent acts developed into what we know as culture of violence theory today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two prominent examples of culture legitimizing violence can be seen in [[rape myth]]s and [[victim blaming]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suarez|first=Eliana|last2=Gadalla|first2=Tahany M.|date=2010-01-11|title=Stop Blaming the Victim: A Meta-Analysis on Rape Myths|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886260509354503|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|language=en|volume=25|issue=11|pages=2010–2035|doi=10.1177/0886260509354503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape myths lead to misconstrued notions of blame; it is common for the responsibility associated with the rape to be placed on the victim rather than the offender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Development of the theory ==
As mentioned previously the culture of violence theory addresses the pervasiveness of specific violent patterns within in a societal dimension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specifically, culture of violence theory explains how cultures and societies can sanction violent acts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While related to [[structural violence]], cultural violence theory is different by explaining why direct acts of violence or violence built into systems of society exists and how they are legitimized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research suggests that cultures can encourage and permit violence to exist as a response to various environmental obstacles, such as widespread resource impoverishment.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199738403.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199738403-e-13|title=Culture of Honor, Violence, and Homicide|last=Brown|first=Ryan P.|last2=Osterman|first2=Lindsey L.|date=2012-07-20|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199738403.013.0013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen within various aspects of culture, such as film, television, music, language, art, and propaganda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ph.D|first=LeeAnn Kahlor|last2=Ph.D|first2=Matthew S.

== Relation to cultural values in the United States ==

=== Rape myths ===
[[Rape myths]] refer to the inaccurate views and stereotypes of forced sexual acts, and the victims and perpetuators of them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These notions are prevalent among the general population and often suggest that the victims of non-consensual sexual acts have bad reputations, are promiscuous, dress provocatively, or are fabricating assault when they regret the consensual acts after the fact.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These views are often legitimized by the status quo of men dominating women across domains such as family, education, work, and many others.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Rape myth acceptance can lead to poor assault/rape prevention measures, decrease in reporting of assaults/rapes, increases of assaults/rapes, and re-victimization.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Violence in relationships ===
Violence in relationships, commonly referred to as intimate partner violence (IPV), is impacted by various factors including the presence of mental illness or use of substances.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oram|first=S.|last2=Trevillion|first2=K.|last3=Khalifeh|first3=H.|last4=Feder|first4=G.|last5=Howard|first5=L.

=== Violence in pop culture and media ===
The prevalence of legitimization of violence may be facilitated by its presence in various media.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hald|first=Gert Martin|last2=Malamuth|first2=Neil M.|last3=Yuen|first3=Carlin|date=2010-01-01|title=Pornography and attitudes supporting violence against women: revisiting the relationship in nonexperimental studies|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.20328/abstract|journal=Aggressive Behavior|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=14–20|doi=10.1002/ab.20328|issn=1098-2337}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that sex-related crimes account for nearly 10% of all dialogue on television related to sex, most of which is found on fictional programs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, research has also found a positive relationship between pornography consumption and attitudes supporting violence against women, especially when the pornography in question is violent in nature.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, consideration of individual differences is necessary in evaluating exposure to violent media and overall outcomes.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffner|first=Cynthia A.|last2=Levine|first2=Kenneth J.|date=2005-05-01|title=Enjoyment of Mediated Fright and Violence: A Meta-Analysis|url=https://doi.org/10.1207/S1532785XMEP0702_5|journal=Media Psychology|volume=7|issue=2|pages=207–237|doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0702_5|issn=1521-3269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors which influence media content exposure and subsequent outcomes include gender and personality traits.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Individuals who are male, hostile, impulsive, and are low on empathy are more likely to be susceptible to violent media exposure.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Public justification of violence ===
Public justification of violence arise when those not necessarily directly involved in the violent act will not react negatively to the violence because they believe it is warranted.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Examples of public justification of violence are most evident in rape myths and victim blaming, as discussed above.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, the common belief regarding legitimate violence tends to place responsibility on victims or potential victims of violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Another example that is not as often noted, is the pervasive notion of the "chosen one," within some extremist religious language and various nationalism propaganda that will function as a means to perpetuate the undermining of the other and allowance of violence against the other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trauma responses and cultural violence ==
Early childhood trauma, specifically exposure to abuse or violence, is linked to mental health disorder development.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Witnessing domestic violence during childhood places individuals at a greater risk for developing psychological disorders such as depression.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; General functioning may be impacted in behavioral or emotional domains as a result of exposure to domestic violence as a child.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a widely supported potential resultant diagnosis of childhood trauma.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alisic|first=Eva|last2=Zalta|first2=Alyson K.|last3=Wesel|first3=Floryt van|last4=Larsen|first4=Sadie E.|last5=Hafstad|first5=Gertrud S.|last6=Hassanpour|first6=Katayun|last7=Smid|first7=Geert E.|date=2014-05-01|title=Rates of post-traumatic stress disorder in trauma-exposed children and adolescents: meta-analysis|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/204/5/335|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=204|issue=5|pages=335–340|doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.113.131227|issn=0007-1250|pmid=24785767}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, interpersonal trauma places children and adolescents at an increased risk for developing PTSD, with girls being the most susceptible.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Furthermore, exposure to bullying has also been shown to induce symptoms of PTSD or be connected to a PTSD diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Morten Birkeland|last2=Tangen|first2=Tone|last3=Idsoe|first3=Thormod|last4=Matthiesen|first4=Stig Berge|last5=Magerøy|first5=Nils|title=Post-traumatic stress disorder as a consequence of bullying at work and at school.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15021">In [[logic]], a true/false [[decision problem]] is '''decidable''' if there exists an [[effective method]] for deriving the correct answer (instead of looping indefinitely, crashing, returning "don't know", or returning a wrong answer). [[Formal system|Logical system]]s such as [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] are decidable if membership in their set of [[Validity (logic)|logically valid]] formulas (or theorems) can be effectively determined. A [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] (set of sentences [[Deductive closure|closed]] under [[logical consequence]]) in a fixed logical system is decidable if there is an effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are included in the theory. Many important problems are [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], that is, it has been proven that no effective method for determining membership (returning a correct answer after finite, though possibly very long, time in all cases) can exist for them.

==Relationship to computability==

As with the concept of a [[decidable set]], the definition of a decidable theory or logical system can be given either in terms of ''[[effective method]]s'' or in terms of ''[[computable function]]s''. These are generally considered equivalent per [[Church's thesis]]. Indeed, the proof that a logical system or theory is undecidable will use the formal definition of computability to show that an appropriate set is not a decidable set, and then invoke Church's thesis to show that the theory or logical system is not decidable by any effective method (Enderton 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;206''ff.'').

==Decidability of a logical system==

Each [[logical system]] comes with both a [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic component]], which among other things determines the notion of [[formal proof|provability]], and a [[Formal semantics (logic)|semantic component]], which determines the notion of [[logical validity]]. The logically valid formulas of a system are sometimes called the '''theorems''' of the system, especially in the context of first-order logic where [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] establishes the equivalence of semantic and syntactic consequence. In other settings, such as [[linear logic]], the syntactic consequence (provability) relation may be used to define the theorems of a system.

A logical system is decidable if there is an effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are theorems of the logical system. For example, [[propositional logic]] is decidable, because the [[truth table|truth-table]] method can be used to determine whether an arbitrary [[propositional formula]] is logically valid.

[[First-order logic]] is not decidable in general; in particular, the set of logical validities in any [[signature (logic)|signature]] that includes equality and at least one other predicate with two or more arguments is not decidable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Trakhtenbrot|Trakhtenbrot]], 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Logical systems extending first-order logic, such as [[second-order logic]] and [[type theory]], are also undecidable.

The validities of [[monadic predicate calculus]] with identity are decidable, however. This system is first-order logic restricted to signatures that have no function symbols and whose relation symbols other than equality never take more than one argument.

Some logical systems are not adequately represented by the set of theorems alone. (For example, [[ternary logic|Kleene's logic]] has no theorems at all.) In such cases, alternative definitions of decidability of a logical system are often used, which ask for an effective method for determining something more general than just validity of formulas; for instance, validity of [[sequent]]s, or the [[logical consequence|consequence relation]] {(Г, ''A'') | Г ⊧ ''A''} of the logic.

==Decidability of a theory==

A [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] is a set of formulas, which here is assumed to be closed under [[logical consequence]]. The question of decidability for a theory is whether there is an effective procedure that, given an arbitrary formula in the signature of the theory, decides whether the formula is a member of the theory or not. This problem arises naturally when a theory is defined as the set of logical consequences of a fixed set of axioms. Examples of decidable first-order theories include the theory of [[real closed field]]s, and [[Presburger arithmetic]], while the theory of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[Robinson arithmetic]] are examples of undecidable theories.

There are several basic results about decidability of theories. Every inconsistent theory is decidable, as every formula in the signature of the theory will be a logical consequence of, and thus a member of, the theory. Every [[complete theory|complete]] [[recursively enumerable]] first-order theory is decidable. An extension of a decidable theory may not be decidable. For example, there are undecidable theories in propositional logic, although the set of validities (the smallest theory) is decidable.

A consistent theory that has the property that every consistent extension is undecidable is said to be '''essentially undecidable'''. In fact, every consistent extension will be essentially undecidable. The theory of fields is undecidable but not essentially undecidable. [[Robinson arithmetic]] is known to be essentially undecidable, and thus every consistent theory that includes or interprets Robinson arithmetic is also (essentially) undecidable.

==Some decidable theories==

Some decidable theories include (Monk 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;234):&lt;ref name=Monk1976 /&gt;
* The set of first-order logical validities in the signature with only equality, established by [[Leopold Löwenheim]] in 1915.
* The  set of first-order logical validities in a signature with equality and one unary function, established by Ehrenfeucht in 1959.
* The first-order theory of the natural numbers in the signature with equality and addition, also called [[Presburger arithmetic]]. The completeness was established by [[Mojżesz Presburger]] in 1929.
* The first-order theory of the natural numbers in the signature with equality and multiplication, also called [[Skolem arithmetic]].
* The first-order theory of Boolean algebras, established by [[Alfred Tarski]] in 1940 (found in 1940 but published in 1949).
* The first-order theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic, established by Tarski in 1949.
* The [[Decidability of First-order Theory of Real Numbers|first-order theory of real-closed ordered fields]], [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem|established by Tarski in 1949]] (see also [[Tarski's exponential function problem]]).
* The first-order theory of Euclidean geometry, established by Tarski in 1949.
* The first-order theory of Abelian groups, established by Szmielew in 1955.
* The first-order theory of hyperbolic geometry, established by Schwabhäuser in 1959.
* Specific [[decidable sublanguages of set theory]] investigated in the 1980s through today.(Cantone ''et al.'', 2001)

Methods used to establish decidability include [[quantifier elimination]], [[model completeness]], and [[Vaught's test]].

==In context of games==
Some [[games]] have been classified as to their decidability:
* [[Chess]] is decidable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/47722/q-is-chess-game-movement-tm-decidable http://cs.stackexchange.com/Computer Science.

* Mate in ''n'' in [[infinite chess]] (with limitations on rules and gamepieces) is decidable.&lt;ref name="Decidability"&gt;[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/27967/decidability-of-chess-on-an-infinite-board/63684 Mathoverflow.net/Decidability-of-chess-on-an-infinite-board] Decidability-of-chess-on-an-infinite-board.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mate in N"&gt;Dan Brumleve, Joel David Hamkins, Philipp Schlicht, The Mate-in-n Problem of Infinite Chess Is Decidable, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Volume 7318, 2012, pp. 78-88, Springer [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-30870-3_9], available at [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.5597v4 arXiv].&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are positions (with finitely many pieces) that are forced wins, but not mate in ''n'' for any finite ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/63423/checkmate-in-omega-moves&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some team games with imperfect information on a finite board (but with unlimited time) are undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/sampler.pdf http://www-math.mit.edu/Undecidable Problems: A Sampler, Bjorn Poonen] Undecidable Problems: A Sampler, Bjorn Poonen (Section 14.1, "Abstract games").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some undecidable theories==
Some undecidable theories include (Monk 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;279):&lt;ref name=Monk1976&gt;{{cite book|author =Donald Monk | year = 1976| title =Mathematical Logic| publisher =Springer-Verlag |isbn=9780387901701}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The set of logical validities in any first-order signature with equality and either: a relation symbol of arity no less than 2, or two unary function symbols, or one function symbol of arity no less than 2, established by [[Boris Trakhtenbrot|Trakhtenbrot]] in 1953.
* The first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition, multiplication, and equality, established by Tarski and [[Andrzej Mostowski]] in 1949.
* The first-order theory of the rational numbers with addition, multiplication, and equality, established by [[Julia Robinson]] in 1949.
* The first-order theory of groups, established by [[Alfred Tarski]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1=Tarski| first1=A. | last2=Mostovski| first2=A. | last3=Robinson| first3=R. |  title=Undecidable Theories | publisher=North-Holland, Amsterdam | series=Studies in Logic and the Foundation of Mathematics | year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Remarkably, not only the general theory of groups is undecidable, but also several more specific theories, for example (as established by Mal'cev 1961)  the theory of finite groups. Mal'cev also established that the theory of semigroups and the theory of rings are undecidable. Robinson established in 1949 that the theory of fields is undecidable.
* [[Robinson arithmetic]] (and therefore any consistent extension, such as [[Peano arithmetic]]) is essentially undecidable, as established by [[Raphael Robinson]] in 1950.
* The first-order theory with equality and two function symbols&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gurevich |first=Yuri |date=1976 |title= The Decision Problem for Standard Classes|url=http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/journals/jsyml/Gurevich76 |journal= J. Symb. Log.|publisher= |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=460–464 |doi= |access-date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[interpretability]] method is often used to establish undecidability of theories. If an essentially undecidable theory ''T'' is interpretable in a consistent theory ''S'', then ''S'' is also essentially undecidable. This is closely related to the concept of a [[many-one reduction]] in computability theory.

==Semidecidability==

A property of a theory or logical system weaker than decidability is '''semidecidability'''.  A theory is semidecidable if there is an effective method which, given an arbitrary formula, will always tell correctly when the formula is in the theory, but may give either a negative answer or no answer at all when the formula is not in the theory. A logical system is semidecidable if there is an effective method for generating theorems (and only theorems) such that every theorem will eventually be generated. This is different from decidability because in a semidecidable system there may be no effective procedure for checking that a formula is ''not'' a theorem.

Every decidable theory or logical system is semidecidable, but in general the converse is not true; a theory is decidable if and only if both it and its complement are semi-decidable. For example, the  set of logical validities ''V'' of first-order logic is semi-decidable, but not decidable. In this case, it is because there is no effective method for determining for an arbitrary formula ''A'' whether ''A'' is not in ''V''. Similarly, the set of logical consequences of any [[recursively enumerable set]] of first-order axioms is semidecidable. Many of the examples of undecidable first-order theories given above are of this form.

==Relationship with completeness==

Decidability should not be confused with [[complete theory|completeness]]. For example, the theory of [[algebraically closed field]]s is decidable but incomplete, whereas the set of all true first-order statements about nonnegative integers in the language with + and &amp;times; is complete but undecidable. 
Unfortunately, as a terminological ambiguity, the term "undecidable statement" is sometimes used as a synonym for [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent statement]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21601">A '''hot-cold empathy gap''' is a [[cognitive bias]] in which people underestimate the influences of [[#Visceral_factors|visceral drives]] on their own attitudes, preferences, and behaviors.&lt;ref name=VanBoven2013/&gt;

The most important aspect of this idea is that human understanding is "state-dependent". For example, when one is angry, it is difficult to understand what it is like for one to be calm, and vice versa; when one is blindly in love with someone, it is difficult to understand what it is like for one not to be, (or to imagine the possibility of not being blindly in love in the future). Importantly, an inability to minimize one's gap in empathy can lead to negative outcomes in medical settings (e.g., when a doctor needs to accurately diagnose the physical pain of a patient),&lt;ref name=Loewenstein2005/&gt; and in workplace settings (e.g., when an employer needs to assess the need for an employee's bereavement leave).&lt;ref name="Nordgren2011" /&gt;

Hot-cold empathy gaps can be analyzed according to their direction:&lt;ref name="Loewenstein2005" /&gt;
#'''Hot-to-cold''': People under the influence of visceral factors (''hot state'') don't fully grasp how much their behavior and preferences are being driven by their current state; they think instead that these short-term goals reflect their general and long-term preferences.
#'''Cold-to-hot''': People in a ''cold state'' have difficulty picturing themselves in hot states, minimizing the motivational strength of visceral impulses. This leads to unpreparedness when visceral forces inevitably arise.

They can also be classified in regards to their relation with time (past or future) and whether they occur intra- or inter-personally:&lt;ref name="Loewenstein2005" /&gt;
#intrapersonal '''prospective''': the inability to effectively predict their own future behavior when in a different ''state''. See also [[projection bias]].&lt;ref name=Loewenstein2000/&gt;
#intrapersonal '''retrospective''': when people recall or try to understand behaviors that happened in a different ''state''. See [[#retrospective|retrospective hot-cold empathy gaps]].
#'''interpersonal''': the attempt to evaluate behaviors or preferences of another person who is in a ''state'' different from one's own.

The term ''hot-cold empathy gap'' was coined by [[Carnegie Mellon University]] psychologist, [[George Loewenstein]]. Hot-cold empathy gaps are one of Loewenstein's major contributions to behavioral economics.{{According to whom|date=May 2016}}

==Visceral factors==
{{see also|Impulsive behavior}}
Visceral factors are an array of influences which include hunger, thirst, sexual arousal, drug cravings for the drugs one is addicted to, physical pain, and strong emotions. These drives have a disproportionate effect on decision making and behavior: the mind, when affected (i.e., in a hot state), tends to ignore all other goals in an effort to placate these influences. These states can lead a person to feel "out of control" and act impulsively.&lt;ref name="Loewenstein1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Loewenstein1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Risen2007/&gt;

==&lt;span id="retrospective"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Memory==
Hot-cold empathy gap is also dependent on the person's memory of visceral experience. As such, it is very common to underestimate visceral state due to restrictive memory. In general, people are more likely to underestimate the effect of pain in a cold state as compared to those in the hot state.

===The experiment===
Nordgren, van der Pligt and van Harreveld (2006) assessed the impact of pain on the subjects performance on a memory test. In the assessment process, participants were questioned how pain and other factors affected their performance.&lt;ref name=Nordgren2006 /&gt;

===The result of experiment===
The results revealed that those participants in the pain free or cold state undervalued the impact of pain on their performance. Whereas, participants undergoing pain, accurately measured the effect of pain on performance.&lt;ref name=Nordgren2006 /&gt;

==Areas of study==

===Sexual desire===
Implications of the empathy gap were explored in the realm of sexual decision-making, where young men in an unaroused "cold state" failed to predict that in an aroused "hot state" they will be more likely to make risky sexual decisions, (e.g., not using a condom).&lt;ref name="Ariely2006"/&gt;

===Bullying===
The empathy gap has also been an important idea in research about the causes of [[bullying]].&lt;ref name="Robers2010"/&gt;{{rp|IV}} In one study examining a central theory that, "only by identifying with a victim’s social suffering can one understand its devastating effects,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-01-empathy-gap-bullying.html|title=The empathy gap in bullying|publisher=}} Cites {{harvtxt|Nordgren|Banas|MacDonald|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers created five experiments. The first four examined the degree to which participants in a game who were not excluded could estimate the social pain of participants who were excluded. The findings were that those who were not socially excluded consistently underestimated the pain felt by those who were excluded. A survey included in the study directed at teachers' opinions of school policy toward bullying found that those with an experience of social pain, caused by bullying, often rated the pain experienced by those facing bullying or social exclusion as higher than teachers who did not have such experience, and further, that teachers who had experienced social pain were more likely to punish students for bullying.&lt;ref name="Nordgren2011" /&gt;

===Addiction===
George F. Loewenstein explored visceral factors related to addictions like smoking. The factors have to do with drive states which are essential for living – for example, sleepiness and hunger. Somehow, addiction is miscategorized as an essential living drive state due to a behavior disorder.&lt;ref name="Loewenstein1999" /&gt; From the findings emerged new discoveries about hot and cold empathy gap and its important role in drug addictions, such as smoking.

====In smokers====
A study done in year 2008 explored empathy gap within smokers.&lt;ref name="Sayette2008" /&gt;

=====The experiment=====
98 smokers, from the age of 18 to 40 who smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day for their past 12 days and are not interested in quitting, were selected through paper advertisements. For the experiments, smokers were asked to shun smoking for two days. The participants started off from session one and then moved on to session two.&lt;ref name="Sayette2008" /&gt;

# Session one: In this session, smokers were asked to only imagine themselves in pain. This was to encourage the participants to stimulate themselves with thoughts irrelevant to smoking. This lead the experimenters to see if the participants were at either hot or cold stage of empathy gap. After the experimenters discovered the stage of the participants, experimenters did another experiment. The participants in the cold state were categorized in the controlled cue and were asked to remove a plastic cover of a tray after 20 seconds of the exposure of the plastic cover. Underneath was a tape roll. The participants were asked to stare at the tape roll and then were surveyed. The participants in the hot state were categorized in the smoking cue. They were asked to do similar ritual of removing the plastic cover but the only difference was underneath the plastic cover was a pack of cigarettes, a lighter and an ashtray. The participants were asked to pick up a cigarette, light it with the lighter and stare at it without smoking it and were later surveyed. Then they (both controlled and smoker participants) are asked the minimum amount of money needed to delay smoking. Both hot and cold staged participants are asked to state the minimum price amount they need to delay smoking "right now".&lt;ref name="Sayette2008" /&gt;
# Session two: Then the participants were going through similar session as session one. The only difference was that for the participants in the smoking cue were asked to express their minimum price to delay smoking before and after removing the plastic cover off the tray. The participants were also informed that there will be a 50% chance that the compensation the participants expressed will be taken into consideration for their real compensation given at the end of the study. In the end, all participants were rewarded five dollars for their participation.&lt;ref name="Sayette2008" /&gt;

=====Results=====
"Willingness to accept craving" (WTAC) is a measurement based on the money that participants received for previous smoking research. The results indicate that the compensation demand increased from first session to the second session for those in controlled cue and decreased for those in the hot cue.&lt;ref name="Sayette2008" /&gt;

=====Influence in smoking=====
The cold cue participants underpredicted their monetary compensation to delay smoking whereas the hot cue participants overpredicted their monetary compensation. This shows the gap both groups in different stages of empathy. It can also lead to a prediction that they will be misinformed about high risk situations. For example, many smokers in parties will probably underestimate their consumption of smoking, however, the consumption may be higher than predicted for the smoker. Those who would like to quit smoking may find quitting easy, however during the time of quitting smoking, they might find it incredibly difficult to control the urge to smoke. High craving situations will lead to a higher chances for a person to smoke, whereas those who are not in the state of craving smoke will have no idea about how it is like to intensely crave smoking.&lt;ref name="Sayette2008" /&gt;

== Power ==
The [[Power (philosophy)#Bargaining games|bargaining games]] conclude that if one is completely powerless, the one proposing the offer to the powerless will lack strategy. Thus, the powerless will ironically receive higher outcomes. This is because of the egocentric empathy gap.&lt;ref name=Handgraaf2008 /&gt;{{rp|1138}}

In general, people have difficulty taking perspectives of a typical situation and [[decision making]]. Often, attribution bias of [[false consensus]] is the reason why the overestimation of similar perspective occurs.&lt;ref name="Carlson2010"/&gt;{{rp|480}}

=== Van Boven experiment ===
Van Boven divided students in the experiment into sellers and buyers of the coffee mug. He collected the price that buyers are willing to pay and collected the price at which the sellers are willing to sell the mug. To test the empathy gap, the buyers of the coffee mug were also asked to predict the price that the sellers would have to offer.&lt;ref name=VanBoven2003 /&gt;

==== Results ====
Prediction of the sellers and buyers were close to their own price proposed and depended on their own evaluation of the mug. This leads to a conclusion that empathy gap does exist since both parties were unable to evaluate the other party. When being the weaker party, an encouragement of being more strategic occurs since the weaker party fears that their outcome will be in threat. In fact, this leads to a decision more in favor of the weaker party.&lt;ref name=VanBoven2003 /&gt;

==== General conclusion about the results ====
Further conclusion can be made about empathy gap and power: the weaker party often doesn't realize that being in a weaker party can actually give them more power to strategically think and make decision, leading to better outcomes. The weaker party has no idea what they are capable of doing. They convince themselves that being more powerful is often more advantageous. Whereas the powerful party lacks strategy and leads to a poor outcome.
Trial of experiments that held different combinations of the ultimatum game was done. The trials lead to an ultimate conclusion that participants like to be more powerful than to be powerless. Since the reasoning is not necessarily true due to attribution bias of false consensus, the powerful ones didn't abuse their power. Even though an assumption of being powerful leads to power's abuse, in reality it calls for more pro-social behavior and responsibility.&lt;ref name=Handgraaf2008 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5631">In [[mathematics]], '''essential dimension''' is an invariant defined for certain [[algebraic structure]]s such as [[algebraic group]]s and [[quadratic form]]s. It was introduced by [[Joe P. Buhler|J. Buhler]] and [[Zinovy Reichstein|Z. Reichstein]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the essential dimension of a finite group|journal=Compositio Mathematica|year=1997|first=J.|last=Buhler|author2=Reichstein, Z. |volume=106|issue=2|pages=159–179|id= |url=|format=|doi=10.1023/A:1000144403695 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2008-04-15--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
and in its most generality defined by [[Alexander Merkurjev|A. Merkurjev]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Essential Dimension: a Functorial Point of View (after A. Merkurjev)|journal=Documenta Mathematica|year=2003|first=G.|last=Berhuy|author2=Favi, G. |volume=8|issue=|pages=279–330 (electronic)|id= |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basically, essential dimension measures the complexity of algebraic structures via their [[field (mathematics)|field]]s of definition. For example, a [[quadratic form]] q : V → K over a field K, where V is a K-[[vector space]], is said to be defined over a subfield L of K if there exists a K-[[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of V such that q can be expressed in the form &lt;math&gt;q(\sum x_i e_i) = \sum a_{ij} x_ix_j&lt;/math&gt; with all coefficients a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; belonging to L. If K has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] different from 2, every quadratic form is [[quadratic form#Equivalence of Quadratic Forms|diagonalizable]]. Therefore, q has a field of definition generated by n elements. Technically, one always works over a (fixed) base field k and the fields K and L in consideration are supposed to contain k. The essential dimension of q is then defined as the least [[transcendence degree]] over k of a subfield L of K over which q is defined.

==Formal definition==
Fix an arbitrary field k and let ''Fields/k'' denote the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of finitely generated [[field extension]]s of k with inclusions as [[morphism]]s. Consider a (covariant) [[functor]] F : Fields/k → [[category of sets|Set]].
For a field extension K/k and an element ''a'' of F(K/k) a ''field of definition of a'' is an [[intermediate field]] K/L/k such that ''a'' is contained in the image of the map F(L/k) → F(K/k) induced by the inclusion of L in K.

The ''essential dimension of a'', denoted by ''ed(a)'', is the least transcendence degree (over k) of a field of definition for ''a''. The '''essential dimension of the functor F''', denoted by ''ed(F)'', is the supremum of ''ed(a)'' taken over all elements ''a'' of F(K/k) and objects K/k of Fields/k.

==Examples==
* Essential dimension of [[quadratic form]]s: For a natural number ''n'' consider the functor Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; : Fields/k → Set taking a field extension K/k to the set of [[isomorphism class]]es of non-degenerate n-dimensional quadratic forms over K and taking a morphism L/k → K/k (given by the inclusion of L in K) to the map sending the isomorphism class of a quadratic form q : V → L to the isomorphism class of the quadratic form &lt;math&gt; q_K : V\otimes_L K \to K &lt;/math&gt;.
* Essential dimension of [[algebraic group]]s: For an algebraic group G over k denote by H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(-,G) : Fields/k → Set the functor taking a field extension K/k to the set of isomorphism classes of G-[[torsor]]s over K (in the [[flat topology|fppf]]-topology). The essential dimension of this functor is called the ''essential dimension of the algebraic group G'', denoted by ed(G).
* Essential dimension of a [[fibered category]]: Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be a category fibered over the category &lt;math&gt;Aff/k &lt;/math&gt; of affine k-schemes, given by a functor &lt;math&gt; p : \mathcal{F} \to Aff/k. &lt;/math&gt; For example, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F} &lt;/math&gt; may be the [[Moduli of algebraic curves|moduli stack]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M}_g &lt;/math&gt; of genus g curves or the classifying stack &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{BG}&lt;/math&gt; of an algebraic group. Assume that for each &lt;math&gt; A \in Aff/k &lt;/math&gt; the isomorphism classes of objects in the fiber p&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(A) form a set. Then we get a functor F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; : Fields/k → Set taking a field extension K/k to the set of isomorphism classes in the fiber &lt;math&gt;p^{-1}(Spec(K))&lt;/math&gt;. The essential dimension of the fibered category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the essential dimension of the corresponding functor F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. In case of the classifying stack &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{BG}&lt;/math&gt; of an algebraic group G the value coincides with the previously defined essential dimension of G.

==Known results==

* The essential dimension of a linear algebraic group G is always finite and bounded by the minimal dimension of a generically free [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]] minus the dimension of G.
* The essential dimension of a finite algebraic [[p-group]] over k equals the minimal dimension of a faithful representation, provided that the base field k contains a primitive p-th root of unity.
* The essential dimension of the symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (viewed as algebraic group over k) is known for n≤5 (for every base field k), for n=6 (for k of characteristic not 2) and for n=7 (in characteristic 0).
* Let T be an [[algebraic torus]] admitting a [[Galois field|Galois splitting field]] L/k of degree a power of a prime p. Then the essential dimension of T equals the least rank of the kernel of a homomorphism of Gal(L/k)-[[lattice (group)|lattice]]s P → X(T) with [[cokernel]] finite and of order prime to p, where P is a permutation lattice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4808">In [[topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], an '''extension topology''' is a [[topology (structure)|topology]] placed on the [[disjoint union]] of a [[topological space]] and another [[Set (mathematics)|set]].

There are various types of extension topology, described in the sections below.

== Extension topology ==

Let X be a topological space and P a set disjoint from X. Consider in X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the topology whose open sets are of the form: A&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Q, where A is an open set of X and Q is a subset of P.

Note that the closed sets of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P are of the form: B&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Q, where B is a closed set of X and Q is a subset of P.

For these reasons this topology is called the '''extension topology''' of X plus P, with which one extends to X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the open and the closed sets of X. Note that the [[subspace topology]] of X as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the original topology of X, while the subspace topology of P as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the [[discrete space|discrete topology]].

Being Y a topological space and R a subset of Y, one might ask whether the extension topology of Y - R plus R is the same as the original topology of Y, and the answer is in general no.

Note the similitude of this extension topology construction and the [[One-point compactification#Alexandroff one-point compactification|Alexandroff one-point compactification]], in which case, having a topological space X which one wishes to compactify by adding a point ∞ in infinity, one considers the closed sets of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{∞} to be the sets of the form: K, where K is a closed compact set of X, or B&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{∞}, where B is a closed set of X.

== Open extension topology ==

Let X be a topological space and P a set disjoint from X. Consider in X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the topology whose open sets are of the form: X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Q, where Q is a subset of P, or A, where A is an open set of X.

For this reason this topology is called the '''open extension topology''' of X plus P, with which one extends to X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the open sets of X. Note that the [[subspace topology]] of X as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the original topology of X, while the subspace topology of P as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the [[discrete space|discrete topology]].

Note that the closed sets of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P are of the form: Q, where Q is a subset of P, or B&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P, where B is a closed set of X.

Being Y a topological space and R a subset of Y, one might ask whether the extension topology of Y - R plus R is the same as the original topology of Y, and the answer is in general no.

Note that the open extension topology of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is [[comparison of topologies|smaller]] than the extension topology of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P.

Being Z a set and p a point in Z, one obtains the [[excluded point topology]] construction by considering in Z the [[discrete space|discrete topology]] and applying the open extension topology construction to Z - {p} plus p.

== Closed extension topology ==

Let X be a topological space and P a set disjoint from X. Consider in X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the topology whose closed sets are of the form: X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Q, where Q is a subset of P, or B, where B is a closed set of X.

For this reason this topology is called the '''closed extension topology''' of X plus P, with which one extends to X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the closed sets of X. Note that the [[subspace topology]] of X as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the original topology of X, while the subspace topology of P as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the [[discrete space|discrete topology]].

Note that the open sets of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P are of the form: Q, where Q is a subset of P, or A&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P, where A is an open set of X.

Being Y a topological space and R a subset of Y, one might ask whether the extension topology of Y - R plus R is the same as the original topology of Y, and the answer is in general no.

Note that the closed extension topology of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is [[comparison of topologies|smaller]] than the extension topology of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P.

Being Z a set and p a point in Z, one obtains the [[particular point topology]] construction by considering in Z the [[discrete space|discrete topology]] and applying the closed extension topology construction to Z - {p} plus p.

The '''Grinold and Kroner Model''' is used to calculate expected returns for a [[stock]], stock [[Stock market index|index]] or the market as whole. It is a part of a larger framework for making forecasts about market expectations.

The model states that:

'''&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{E}[R] = \frac{\mathrm{Div}_1}{P_0} + i  + g  - \Delta S  + \Delta (P/E) &lt;/math&gt;'''&lt;ref&gt;Richard Grinold and Kenneth Kroner, "The Equity Risk Premium," ''Investment Insights'' (Barclays Global Investors, July 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li color="black"&gt; &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{E}[R] &lt;/math&gt; are the expected returns 
&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Div}_1&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dividend]] in next period (period 1 assuming current t=0)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; is the current price (price at time 0)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the expected inflation rate
&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the real growth rate in earnings (note that by adding real growth and inflation, this is basically identical to just adding nominal growth)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt; \Delta S &lt;/math&gt; is the changes in shares outstanding (i.e. increases in shares outstanding decrease expected returns)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt; \Delta (P/E) &lt;/math&gt; is the changes in P/E ratio (positive relationship between changes in P/e and expected returns).
&lt;/ul&gt;

One offshoot of this [[discounted cash flow]] analysis is the Fed Model. Under the Fed model, the earnings yield is compared to the 10-year treasury bonds. If the earnings yield is lower than that of the bonds, the investor would shift their money into the less risky T-bonds.

Grinold, Kroner, and Siegel (2011) estimated the inputs to the Grinold and Kroner model and arrived at a then-current equity risk premium estimate between 3.5% and 4%.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Grinold, Kenneth Kroner, and Laurence Siegel, "A Supply Model of the Equity Premium," in B. Hammond, M. Leibowitz, and L. Siegel, eds., Rethinking the Equity Risk Premium, Charlottesville, VA: Research Foundation of CFA Institute, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The equity risk premium is the difference between the expected total return on a capitalization-weighted stock market index and the yield on a riskless government bond (in this case one with 10 years to maturity).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18262">The '''Information Coding Classification''' ('''ICC''') is a [[classification system]] covering almost all extant 6500 knowledge fields ([[knowledge domain]]s). Its [[conceptualization]] goes beyond the scope of the well known  library classification systems, such as [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DCC), [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC), and [[Library of Congress Classification]] (LCC), by extending also to [[knowledge system]]s that so far have not afforded to  classify  [[literature]].  ICC actually presents a flexible universal ordering system for both literature and other kinds of [[information]], set out as knowledge fields. From a methodological point of view, ICC differs from the above-mentioned systems along the following three lines:
# Its main classes are not based on [[discipline]]s but on nine live stages of development, so-called [[ontic]]al levels.
# It breaks them roughly down into hierarchical steps by further nine [[Categorization|categories]] which makes decimal number coding possible.
# The contents of a knowledge field is earmarked via a digital position scheme, which makes the first hierarchical step refer to the nine ontical levels  (object areas as subject categories), and the second hierarchical step refer to nine functionally ordered form categories.
Respective knowledge fields permit to step down by the same principle to a third and  forth level, and even further to a fifth and sixth level. Finally, knowledge field subdivisions will have to conform to said digital position scheme.
Hence, for a given knowledge field identical codes will mark identical categories under respective numbers of the coding system. This  [[mnemotechnics|mnemotechnical]]  aspect of the  system helps memorizing and straightaway retrieving the whereabouts of respective [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] fields.

The first two hierarchical levels may be regarded as a top- or [[upper ontology]] for ontologies and other applications.

The terms of the first three hierarchical levels were set out in German and English in ''Wissensorganisation. Entwicklung, Aufgabe, Anwendung, Zukunft'',&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Ingetraut Dahlberg]]|EditorSurname1=Deutsche Sektion der Internationalen Gesellschaft für Wissensorganisation e.V.

It was published in 2014 and available so far only in German. In the meantime, also the French terms of the knowlwdge fields have been collected.
Competence for maintenance and further development rests with the German Chapter of the  
[[International Society for Knowledge Organization]] (ISKO) e.V.

== Historical development ==
At the end of 1970, Prof. Alwin Diemer, Univ.of Düsseldorf proposed to [[Ingetraut Dahlberg]] to undertake a philosophical [[dissertation]] on ''The universal classification system of knowledge, its ontological, epistemological, and information theoretical foundations''. Diemer had in mind an innovating ontological approach for such a system based on the whole spectrum of kinds of being and complying with [[epistemological]] requirements. The third requirement had already been taken up somehow in the Indian [[Colon Classification]], yet it still called for explanations and additions. In 1974, the dissertation was published in German entitled ''Grundlagen universaler Wissensordnung''.&lt;ref name="GuWo"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|EditorSurname1=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Dokumentation e.V.|Title=Grundlagen universaler Wissensordnung. Probleme und Möglichkeiten eines universalen Klassifikationssystems des Wissens. : im Antiquariat noch erhältlich sonst als Print on Demand bei deGruyter|Publisher=Verlag Dokumentation|PublicationPlace=Pullach bei München|Year=1974|ISBN=978-3111412672|Date=  1974|language=German|AccessDate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started with conceptual clarifications, and why and how the term „universal“ was linked to knowledge, including knowledge fields, such as commodity science, artefacts,  statistics, patents, standardization, communication, utility services et al. In chapter 3, six universal classification systems (DDC, UDC, LCC, BC, CC and BBK) were presented,  analyzed and compared.

While preparing the dissertation, Dahlberg started with elaborating the new universal system by first gleaning a lot of extant designations of knowledge fields from whatever available reference works. This was funded by the German Documentation Society (DGD) (1971-2) under the title of ''Order system of knowledge fields''. In addition, the [[syllabus]]es of German universities and polytechniques were explored for relevant terms and documented (1975).  Thereafter, it seemed necessary to add definitions from special dictionaries and encyclopediae; it soon appeared that the 12.500 terms included numerous synonyms, so that the whole collection boiled down to about 6.500 concept designations (Project Logstruktur, supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) 1976-78).

The outcome of this work &lt;ref name="GuWo" /&gt; was the formulation of 30 theses which ended up in 12 principles for the new system, published 40 years later under.&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt; These principles refer not only to theoretical foundations but also to structure and other organizational aspects of the whole array of knowledge fields. In 1974, the digital position scheme for field subdivision had already been developed  to allow for classifying classification literature in the bibliographical section of the first issue of the Journal International Classification. In 1977, the entire ICC  was ready for presentation at a seminar in Bangalore, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|EditorSurname1=Sarada Ranganathan Endowment for Library Science|Title=Ontical Structures and Universal Classification |PublicationPlace=Bangalore|Year=1978|Date=  1978|language=German|AccessDate=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A publication of the first three hierarchical levels appeared however only in 1982.&lt;ref name="ICC-PSAP"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|Periodical=International Classification|Title=ICC – Information Coding Classification.

== Governing principles of ICC ==
These were published in full length in the book ''Wissensorganisation. Entwicklung, Aufgabe, Anwendung, Zukunft''&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt; and the  article ''Information Coding Classification. Geschichtliches, Prinzipien, Inhaltliches'',&lt;ref name="ICC2010"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|EditorSurname1=Marlies Ockenfeld|Periodical=Information, Wissenschaft &amp; Praxis|Title=Information Coding Classification. Geschichtliches, Prinzipien, Inhaltliches |Volume=61, Heft 8|Publisher=De Gruyter|Year=2010|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;449-454|ISSN=1619-4292|Date=  2010|language=German|AccessDate=2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence it suffices to just mention their topics with some necessary additions.

* Principle 1: Concept theoretical approaches. Concepts are the contents of ICC, they are understood as being units of knowledge. The „birth“ of a concept. Where do the characteristics, the knowledge elements come from? How do conceptual relations arise?
* Principle 2: The four kinds of concept relations and their applications.
* Principle 3: Decimal numbers form the ICC codes as its universal language.
* Principle 4: The nine ontical levels of ICC. They were grouped under three captions: Prolegomena (1-3), life sciences (4-6) and human output (7-9):
:# Structure and form
:# Matter and energy
:# Cosmos and earth
:# Biosphere
:# Anthroposphere
:# Sociosphere
:# Material products (economics and technology)
:# Intellectual products (knowledge and information)
:# Spiritual products (products of mind and culture)

* Principle 5: Knowledge fields are structured by categories, based on the Aristotelian form-categories, under a digital position scheme, a kind of scaling rule for subdividing a given field as follows:
:# General area: problems, theories, principles (axiom and structure)
:# Object area: objects, kinds, parts, properties of objects
:# Activity area: methods, processes, activities
:# Field properties or first characterization   
:# Persons or secondary characterization
:# Societies or tertiary characterization
:# Influences from outside
:# Applications of the field to other fields
:# Field information and synthesizing tasks
:The digital position scheme, called Systematifier, has  also been used for structuring the entire system via the categories figuring on the upper zero level.

An example of its application is the structure of the classification system for knowledge organization literature [http://www.isko.org/scheme.php Gliederung der Klassifikationsliteratur]. (A simplified version with an additional introduction is given in,&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;71)

* Principle 6: The ontical levels outlined under principle 4 conform to the „integrative level theory“ which means that every level is integrated in the following one. In addition, each knowledge area presumes the following one.
* Principle 7: The combination potential of knowledge fields (interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity)is determined by the digital position scheme. (Examples are given in,&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;103-4)
* Principle 8: The categories of the zero-level are general concepts, their possible subdivisions could once be used for classificatory statements. (These subdivisions still need elaboration)
* Principle 9 and 10: These relate to the combination potential of classificatory statements with space and time concepts. (Still to be elaborated)
* Principle 11: The system's mnemotechnical aspect relies on the fixed system position codes and on the 3x3 form- and subject-categories.
* Principle 12: The combination potential of system position 1, 8 and 9 make ICC to a self-networking system which complies with the present scientific development.

== ICC in Matrix Form ==

The first two levels of ICC can be represented by following matrix.

[[File:ICC as a Matrix.png|maxi|840px|ICC as a Matrix with the first two hierarchical levels]]

The first hierarchical level of the 9 subject categories results from the first vertical array under codes 1-9.  The second hierarchical level of subject categories is structured by the 9 functionally ordered form categories, listed in the first horizontal line under codes 01-09. Some exceptions are mentioned in principle 7.

== Research work with ICC ==

=== Exploration of automatic classification with ICC ===
For classifying web documents as conceived by Jens Hartmann, University of Karlsruhe, Prof.Walter Koch, University of Graz, has explored in his Institute for Applied Information Technology Research Society (AIT) the application of ICC to automatically classifying metadata of some 350.000 documents. This was facilitated by data generated within the framework of an EU-supported project [http://www.europeana-local.at "EuropeanaLocal"] . For this exploration, three ICC hierarchical levels have been used for some 5000 terms. The result is described in the report of Christoph Mak.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Christian Mak|Periodical=Bericht des Instituts "Angewandte Informationstechnik Forschungsgesellschaft mbh" (AIT)|Title=Kategorisierung des Datenbestandes der EuropeanaLocal-Österreich anhand der ICC |PublicationPlace=Graz|Year=2011|Date=  2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof.Koch regarded a classification degree of almost 50% as a good result, considering that only a shortened version of ICC had been used. In order to reach a better result one would have needed 1–2 years. Also an index of all terms with their codes could be achieved under these explorations.

=== Data Linkage with ICC ===
Motivated by the work of an Italian research Group in Trento on ''Revising the Wordnet Domains Hierarchy: semantics, coverage and balancing'',&lt;ref name="FGinTrnto"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Luisa Bentivogli|Surname2=Pamela Forner|Surname3=Bernardo Magnini|Surname4=Emanuele Pianta|Periodical=Proceedings of COLING 2004 Workshop on "Multilingual Linguistic Resources|Title=[http://multiwordnet.fbk.eu/paper/coling04-ws-WDH.pdf Revising WordNet Domains Hierarchy: Semantics, Coverage, and Balancing] |PublicationPlace=Geneva, Switzerland|Year=2004|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;101-108|Date=  2004|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which the DDC codes were used, Prof. Ernesto DeLuca et al. showed in a study that for such case the use of ICC could lead to essentially better results. This was shown in two contributions: ''Including knowledge domains from the ICC into the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud (LLD)'' &lt;ref name=" IKDfICC"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ernesto William DeLuca et al|Periodical=Knowledge Organization in the 21st Century. Between Historical Patterns and Future Prospects. Proc.13th Int. ISKO Conf.|Title=Including Knowledge Domains from the ICC into the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud |PublicationPlace=Krakau, Polen|Year=2014|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;258-365|Date=  2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Die Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud: Eine mögliche Zugangsoptimierung?'',&lt;ref name="MLLDC"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ernesto William DeLuca et al|Periodical=Information, Wissenschaft &amp; Praxis|Title=Die Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud: Eine mögliche Zugangsoptimierung? |Volume=65, Heft 4-5|Publisher=De Gruyter|Year=2014|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;279-287|ISSN=1619-4292|Date=  2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the LLD was used in a meta-model which contains all resources with the possibility of retrieval and navigation of data from different aspects. By this, the existing work about many thousand knowledge fields (of  ICC) can be combined with the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud, based on RDF/OWL representation of EuroWordNet and similar integrated lexical resources (MultiWordNet, MEMODATA and the Hamburg Metapher BD).

=== Semantic Web structuring with ICC ===
In October 2013, the computer scientist Hermann Bense, Dortmund, explored the possibilities for structuring the Semanic Web with ICC codes. He developed two approaches for a pictorial presentation of knowledge fields with their possible subdivisions. A graphic representation of those knowledge fields pertaining to the first two levels can be found under [http://www.ontology4.us/english/Ontologies/Science%2520Ontology/index.html Ontology4]. The inclusion of the third hierarchical level has been envisaged as the next step.

== Some potential applications of ICC in its present form ==
# Possibility to roughly structure documents, especially bibliographies and reference works.
# Structuring personal repertories, e.g. a [[Who’s Who]] in ''Who’s Who in Classification and Indexing''&lt;ref name="whoiswho"&gt;{{citation/core|EditorSurname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|Title=Who's Who in Classification and Indexing |Publisher=INDEKS Verlag|PublicationPlace=Frankfurt|Year=1983|Date=  1983|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Supporting the recollection of statistics by knowledge fields, e.g. also concerning university professors, statistics of academies, of institutions, of teachers in special education
# Publishing houses could take up ICC codes for their products to help later sorting by knowledge fields.
# As a standard classification ICC may be used in many cases, especially in industry,  [[knowledge management]] and [[knowledge engineering]].
# With the definition of all its terms a lexicon of knowledge fields could be published. This could also be used for such lexica in other languages.&lt;ref name="lexikon"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|Periodical=Knowledge Organisation 39, No.2|Title=A systematic new lexicon of all knowledge fields based on the Information Coding Classification. |Year=2012|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;142-150|Date=  2012|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# As an example, ICC could be used to compare ongoing scientific activities on a European or world-wide scale.
# ICC can also be an appropriate tool for switching between extant universal classification systems.&lt;ref name="switch"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|EditorSurname1=Green, R.|Periodical=Knowledge organization &amp; change. Proc.4th Int.ISKO Conf., Washington, D.C.|Title=Library catalogs and the Internet. Switching for future subject access. |Publisher=INDEKS Verlag|PublicationPlace=Frankfurt|Year=1996|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;155-165|Date=  1996|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ICC can also be a suitable „hang-up system“ for special classification systems, e.g. for special terminological concept systems.
# ICC in its three hierarchies and corresponding explanations might also be used in higher education to supply the youngsters with an overview of knowledge fields and an understanding of the relationships in the whole of human knowledge.
# Similar to the [[Unified Medical Language System]] (UMLS) for medicine such a Unified System of Knowledge Fields could be held available in many languages and thus reach a global understanding of knowledge fields.
# The alphabetical index to all knowledge field concepts could be used for comparisons with other such indexes to help in finding the missing fields in the different universal classification systems.

'''''k''-anonymity''' is a property possessed by certain [[Data anonymization|anonymized data]]. The concept of ''k''-anonymity was first introduced by [[Latanya Arvette Sweeney|Latanya Sweeney]] and [[Pierangela Samarati]] in a paper published in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dataprivacylab.org/dataprivacy/projects/kanonymity/paper3.pdf|title=Protecting privacy when disclosing information: k-anonymity and its enforcement through generalization and suppression|last2=Sweeney|first2=Latanya|last=Samarati|first=Pierangela|date=1998|website=Harvard Data Privacy Lab|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an attempt to solve the problem: "Given person-specific field-structured data, produce a release of the data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful."&lt;ref&gt;P. Samarati. [http://spdp.di.unimi.it/papers/tkde_k-anonymity.pdf Protecting Respondents' Identities in Microdata Release]. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering archive

Sweeney|title=Database Security: k-anonymity|url=http://latanyasweeney.org/work/kanonymity.html|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Sweeney. [http://dataprivacylab.org/dataprivacy/projects/kanonymity/kanonymity.pdf k-anonymity: a model for protecting privacy]. International Journal on Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-based Systems, 10 (5), 2002; 557-570.&lt;/ref&gt; A release of data is said to have the ''k''-anonymity property if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least &lt;math&gt;k - 1&lt;/math&gt; individuals whose information also appear in the release.

K-anonymity received wide-spread media coverage in 2018 when British computer scientist [[Junade Ali]] used the property alongside [[cryptographic hashing]] to create a communication protocol to anonymously verify if a password was leaked without disclosing the searched password.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/02/new-tool-safely-checks-your-passwords-against-a-half-billion-pwned-passwords/|title=Find out if your password has been pwned—without sending it to a server|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/23/1password-bolts-on-a-pwned-password-check|title=1Password bolts on a ‘pwned password’ check – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This protocol was implemented as a public API in [[Troy Hunt]]'s [[Have I Been Pwned?]] service&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/6365662/how-to-find-out-password-leaked-hackers-online/|title=How to find out if your password has been leaked by hackers with this simple Google Chrome trick|date=2018-05-24|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is consumed by multiple services including [[Password manager|Password Managers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2018/02/23/1password-pwned-passwords/|title=1Password Integrates With 'Pwned Passwords' to Check if Your Passwords Have Been Leaked Online|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/1password-helps-you-find-out-if-your-password-is-pwned-1823272286|title=1Password Helps You Find Out if Your Password Is Pwned|last=Conger|first=Kate|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Browser extension|browser extensions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/okta-offers-free-multi-factor-authentication-with-new-product-one-app/|title=Okta offers free multi-factor authentication with new product, One App {{!}} ZDNet|last=Condon|first=Stephanie|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1284488/the-worlds-biggest-database-of-hacked-passwords-is-now-a-chrome-extension-that-checks-yours-automatically/|title=The world’s biggest database of hacked passwords is now a Chrome extension that checks yours automatically|last=Coren|first=Michael J.|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods for ''k''-anonymization==

In the context of ''k''-anonymization problems, a database is a table with ''n'' rows and ''m'' columns. Each row of the table represents a record relating to a specific member of a population and the entries in the various rows need not be unique. The values in the various columns are the values of attributes associated with the members of the population. The following table is a nonanonymized database consisting of the patient records of some fictitious hospital in [[Kochi]]. 
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! '''Name''' !! '''Age''' !!  '''Gender''' !!'''State of domicile''' !! '''Religion''' !! '''Disease'''
|-
|  Ramsha  || 29 ||  Female || [[Tamil Nadu]] || [[Hindu]]   || [[Cancer]]    
|-
|  Yadu  || 24  || Female || [[Kerala]]   || Hindu   || [[Viral disease|Viral infection]] 
|-
|  Salima  || 28 || Female || Tamil Nadu   || [[Muslim]]  || [[Tuberculosis|TB]]
|-
|  Sunny   || 27  || Male|| [[Karnataka]]   || [[Parsi]]   || No illness
|-
|  Joan  || 24  || Female || Kerala   || [[Christian]]   || [[Cardiovascular disease|Heart-related]]
|-
|  Bahuksana  || 23 || Male || Karnataka   || [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]   || TB
|-
|  Rambha  || 19  || Male || Kerala   || Hindu   || Cancer
|-
|   Kishor  ||  29 || Male || Karnataka   || Hindu  || Heart-related
|-
|  Johnson  || 17  || Male || Kerala   || Christian   || Heart-related
|-
|  John  || 19  || Male || Kerala   || Christian   || Viral infection
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

There are 6 attributes and 10 records in this data. There are two common methods for achieving ''k''-anonymity for some value of ''k''.

#'''Suppression''': In this method, certain values of the attributes are replaced by an asterisk '*'. All or some values of a column may be replaced by '*'. In the anonymized table below, we have replaced all the values in the 'Name' attribute and all the values in the 'Religion' attribute with a '*'.
#'''Generalization''': In this method, individual values of attributes are replaced by with a broader category. For example, the value '19' of the attribute 'Age' may be replaced by ' ≤ 20', the value '23' by '20 &lt; Age ≤ 30' , etc.

The next table shows the anonymized database.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! '''Name''' !! '''Age''' !!  '''Gender''' !!'''State of domicile''' !! '''Religion''' !! '''Disease'''
|-
|  *  || 20 &lt; Age ≤ 30 ||  Female || Tamil Nadu || *   || Cancer    
|-
|  *  || 20 &lt; Age ≤ 30 || Female || Kerala   || *   || Viral infection 
|-
|  *  || 20 &lt; Age ≤ 30 || Female || Tamil Nadu   || * || TB
|-
| *   || 20 &lt; Age ≤ 30  || Male|| Karnataka   || *  || No illness
|-
|  * || 20 &lt; Age ≤ 30 || Female || Kerala   || *   || Heart-related
|-
|  *  || 20 &lt; Age ≤ 30 || Male || Karnataka   || *   || TB
|-
|  *  || Age ≤ 20  || Male || Kerala   || *   || Cancer
|-
|   *  ||  20 &lt; Age ≤ 30 || Male || Karnataka   || *  || Heart-related
|-
|  *  || Age ≤ 20  || Male || Kerala   || *   || Heart-related
|-
|  *  || Age ≤ 20 || Male || Kerala   || *   || Viral infection
|}

&lt;/center&gt;

This data has 2-anonymity with respect to the attributes 'Age', 'Gender' and 'State of domicile' since for any combination of these attributes found in any row of the table there are always at least 2 rows with those exact attributes. The attributes available to an adversary are called [[quasi-identifier]]s. Each quasi-identifier tuple occurs in at least ''k'' records for a dataset with ''k''-anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Narayanan|first1=Arvind|last2=Shmatikov|first2=Vitaly|title=Robust De-anonymization of Large Sparse Datasets|url=https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak08netflix.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyerson and Williams (2004) demonstrated that optimal ''k''-anonymity is an [[NP-hard]] problem, however heuristic methods such as ''k''-Optimize as given by Bayardo and Agrawal (2005) often yields effective results.&lt;ref name=Optimal&gt;{{cite journal

| quote = Data de-identification reconciles the demand for release of data for research purposes and the demand for privacy from individuals. This paper proposes and evaluates an optimization algorithm for the powerful de-identification procedure known as ''k''-anonymization. A ''k''-anonymized dataset has the property that each record is indistinguishable from at least ''k'' - 1 others. Even simple restrictions of optimized ''k''-anonymity are NP-hard, leading to significant computational challenges. We present a new approach to exploring the space of possible anonymizations that tames the combinatorics of the problem, and develop data-management strategies to reduce reliance on expensive operations such as sorting. Through experiments on real census data, we show the resulting algorithm can find optimal ''k''-anonymizations under two representative cost measures and a wide range of k. We also show that the algorithm can produce good anonymizations in circumstances where the input data or input parameters preclude finding an optimal solution in reasonable time. Finally, we use the algorithm to explore the effects of different coding approaches and problem variations on anonymization quality and performance. To our knowledge, this is the first result demonstrating optimal ''k''-anonymization of a nontrivial dataset under a general model of the problem.

| quote = The technique of k-anonymization has been proposed in the literature as an alternative way to release public information, while ensuring both data privacy and data integrity. We prove that two general versions of optimal k-anonymization of relations are NP-hard, including the suppression version which amounts to choosing a minimum number of entries to delete from the relation. We also present a polynomial time algorithm for optimal k-anonymity that achieves an approximation ratio independent of the size of the database, when k is constant. In particular, it is a O(k log k)-approximation where the constant in the big-O is no more than 4. However, the runtime of the algorithm is exponential in k. A slightly more clever algorithm removes this condition, but is a O(k logm)-approximation, where m is the degree of the relation. We believe this algorithm could potentially be quite fast in practice.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A practical approximation algorithm that enables solving the ''k''-anonymization problem with an approximation guarantee of &lt;math&gt;O(\log k)&lt;/math&gt; was presented by Kenig and Tassa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenig|first1=Batya|last2=Tassa|first2=Tamir|title=A practical approximation algorithm for optimal k-anonymity|journal=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery|date=2012|volume=25|pages=134–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Caveats ==
Because k-anonymization does not include any randomization, attackers can still make inferences about data sets that may harm individuals. For example, if the 19-year-old John from Kerala is known to be in the database above, then it can be reliably said that he has either cancer, a heart-related disease, or a viral infection.

''K''-anonymization is not a good method to anonymize high-dimensional datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aggarwal|first1=Charu C.|title=On k-Anonymity and the Curse of Dimensionality}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, researchers showed that, given 4 locations, the unicity of mobile phone timestamp-location datasets (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_4&lt;/math&gt;, ''k''-anonymity when &lt;math&gt;k=1&lt;/math&gt;) can be as high as 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A. Hidalgo |author3=Michel Verleysen |author4=Vincent D. Blondel |title=Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=3|pages=1376|date=March 25, 2013|doi=10.1038/srep01376|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html|bibcode=2013NatSR...3E1376D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been shown that ''k''-anonymity can skew the results of a data set if it disproportionately suppresses and generalizes data points with unrepresentative characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Angiuli|first1=Olivia|author2=Joe Blitzstein |author3=Jim Waldo |authorlink3=Jim Waldo|title=How to De-Identify Your Data|url=http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2838930|website=ACM Queue|publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suppression and generalization algorithms used to ''k''-anonymize datasets can be altered, however, so that they do not have such a skewing effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angiuli|first1=Olivia|author2=Jim Waldo|authorlink2=Jim Waldo|title=Statistical Tradeoffs between Generalization and Suppression in the De-Identification of Large-Scale Data Sets|journal=IEEE Computer Society Intl Conference on Computers, Software, and Applications|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kanji''''' ({{lang|ja|漢字}}; [[Help:IPA/Japanese|[kã̠ɴʑi]]] {{Audio|ja-kanji.ogg|listen|help=no}}) are the adopted [[logographic]] [[Chinese characters]] that are used in the [[Japanese writing system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Insup|last2=Taylor|first2=Maurice Martin|title=Writing and literacy in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese|year=1995|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company| location=Amsterdam| isbn=90-272-1794-7| page=305| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDw4gBaPjZgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are used alongside the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] syllabic scripts ''[[hiragana]]'' and ''[[katakana]]''.

==History==
[[File:Nihonshoki tanaka version.jpg|thumb|''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720 AD), considered by historians and archaeologists as the most complete extant historical record of ancient Japan, was written entirely in kanji.]]
[[Chinese character]]s first came to [[Japan]] on official seals, letters, swords, coins, mirrors, and other decorative items imported from [[China]]. The earliest known instance of such an import was the [[King of Na gold seal]] given by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] to a [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] emissary in 57 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Gold Seal (Kin-in)| url =http://museum.city.fukuoka.jp/en/exhibition.html | publisher=Fukuoka City Museum |accessdate =September 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese coins from the first century AD have been found in [[Yayoi-period]] archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="miyake8"&gt;Miyake (2003), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Japanese of that era probably had no comprehension of the script, and would remain illiterate until the fifth century AD.&lt;ref name="miyake8" /&gt; According to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' and ''[[Kojiki]]'', a semi-legendary scholar called [[Wani (scholar)|Wani]] ({{nihongo|王仁}}) was dispatched to Japan by the [[Baekje|Kingdom of Baekje]] during the reign of [[Emperor Ōjin]] in the early fifth century, bringing with him knowledge of [[Confucianism]] and Chinese characters.&lt;ref name="miyake9"&gt;Miyake (2003), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Japanese documents were probably written by bilingual Chinese or Korean officials employed at the [[Yamato period|Yamato]] court.&lt;ref name="miyake8" /&gt; For example, the diplomatic correspondence from [[Five kings of Wa|King Bu of Wa]] to [[Emperor Shun of Liu Song]] in 478 has been praised for its skillful use of [[allusion]]. Later, groups of people called ''fuhito'' were organized under the monarch to read and write [[Classical Chinese]]. During the reign of [[Empress Suiko]] (593–628), the Yamato court began sending full-scale diplomatic missions to China, which resulted in a large increase in Chinese literacy at the Japanese court.&lt;ref name="miyake9" /&gt;

In ancient times paper was so rare that people stenciled kanji onto thin, rectangular strips of wood. These wooden boards were used for communication between government offices, tags for goods transported between various countries, and the practice of writing. The oldest written kanji in Japan discovered so far was written in ink on wood as a wooden strip dated to the 7th century. It is a record of trading for cloth and salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Kanji History in Japan| url = https://ateliers-japon.com/#home | publisher=Les Ateliers de Japon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese language had no written form at the time Chinese characters were introduced, and texts were written and read only in Chinese. Later, during the [[Heian period]] (794–1185), however, a system known as ''[[kanbun]]'' emerged, which involved using Chinese text with [[diacritical mark]]s to allow Japanese speakers to restructure and read Chinese sentences, by changing word order and adding particles and verb endings, in accordance with the rules of [[Japanese grammar]].

Chinese characters also came to be used to write Japanese words, resulting in the modern kana syllabaries. Around 650 AD, a writing system called ''[[man'yōgana]]'' (used in the ancient poetry anthology ''[[Man'yōshū]]'') evolved that used a number of Chinese characters for their sound, rather than for their meaning. Man'yōgana written in [[Grass script|cursive style]] evolved into ''[[hiragana]]'', or ''[[hiragana|onna-de]]'', that is, "ladies' hand,"&lt;ref&gt;Hadamitzky, Wolfgang and Spahn, Mark (2012), ''Kanji and Kana:  A Complete Guide to the Japanese Writing System'',  Third Edition, Rutland, VT:  Tuttle Publishing. {{ISBN|4805311169}}. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; a writing system that was accessible to women (who were denied [[higher education]]). Major works of [[Heian-era]] [[literature]] by women were written in hiragana. ''[[Katakana]]'' emerged via a parallel path: [[monastery]] students simplified ''man'yōgana'' to a single constituent element. Thus the two other writing systems, hiragana and katakana, referred to collectively as ''[[kana]]'', are descended from kanji.

In modern Japanese, kanji are used to write parts of the language (usually [[content word]]s) such as [[noun]]s, [[adjective]] [[word stem|stems]], and [[verb]] [[word stem|stems]], while hiragana are used to write [[inflection|inflected]] verb and adjective endings and as [[phonetic complement]]s to disambiguate readings (''[[okurigana]]''), [[grammatical particle|particles]], and miscellaneous words which have no kanji or whose kanji is considered obscure or too difficult to read or remember. [[Katakana]] are mostly used for representing [[onomatopoeia]], [[gairaigo|non-Japanese loanwords]] (except those borrowed from [[Old Chinese|ancient Chinese]]), the names of plants and animals (with exceptions), and for emphasis on certain words.

==Orthographic reform and lists of kanji==
{{Main|Japanese script reform}}
[[File:Yōshū Chikanobu Shin Bijin No. 20.jpg|thumb|left|A young woman practicing kanji. [[Ukiyo-e]] woodblock print by [[Toyohara Chikanobu|Yōshū Chikanobu]], 1897]]
In 1946, following [[World War II]] and under the [[Occupation of Japan|Allied Occupation of Japan]], the Japanese government, guided by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] instituted a series of [[orthography|orthographic]] reforms. This was done with the goal of facilitating learning for children and simplifying kanji use in literature and periodicals.
The number of characters in circulation was reduced, and formal lists of characters to be learned during each grade of school were established.
Some characters were given simplified [[glyph]]s, called {{nihongo||新字体|[[shinjitai]]}}. Many variant forms of characters and obscure alternatives for common characters were officially discouraged.

These are simply guidelines, so many characters outside these standards are still widely known and commonly used; these are known as {{Nihongo||表外字|[[hyōgaiji]]}}.

===Kyōiku kanji===
{{Main|Kyōiku kanji}}
The {{Nihongo||教育漢字|kyōiku kanji|{{abbr|lit.|literally}} "education kanji"}} are 1,006 characters that Japanese children learn in elementary school. Originally the list only contained 881 characters. This was expanded to 996 characters in 1977. It was not until 1982 the list was expanded to its current size. The grade-level breakdown of these kanji is known as the {{Nihongo||学年別漢字配当表|gakunen-betsu kanji haitōhyō}}, or the ''gakushū kanji''.  ([[:ja:学年別漢字配当表]])

===Jōyō kanji===
{{Main|Jōyō kanji}}
The {{Nihongo||常用漢字|jōyō kanji|regular-use kanji}} are 2,136 characters consisting of all the ''Kyōiku kanji'', plus 1,130 additional kanji taught in junior high and high school.&lt;ref&gt;Tamaoka, K., Makioka, S., Sanders, S. &amp; Verdonschot, R.G. (2017). www.kanjidatabase.com: a new interactive online database for psychological and linguistic research on Japanese kanji and their compound words. Psychological Research, 81, 696-708.&lt;/ref&gt; In publishing, characters outside this category are often given ''[[furigana]]''. The ''jōyō kanji'' were introduced in 1981, replacing an older list of 1,850 characters known as the {{Nihongo||当用漢字|[[tōyō kanji]]|general-use kanji}}, introduced in 1946. Originally numbering 1,945 characters, the ''jōyō kanji'' list was extended to 2,136 in 2010. Some of the new characters were previously ''Jinmeiyō kanji''; some are used to write prefecture names: {{Nihongo2|阪}}, {{Nihongo2|熊}}, {{Nihongo2|奈}}, {{Nihongo2|岡}}, {{Nihongo2|鹿}}, {{Nihongo2|梨}}, {{Nihongo2|阜}}, {{Nihongo2|埼}}, {{Nihongo2|茨}}, {{Nihongo2|栃}} and {{Nihongo2|媛}}.

===Jinmeiyō kanji===
{{Main|Jinmeiyō kanji}}
Since September 27, 2004, the {{Nihongo||人名用漢字|jinmeiyō kanji|kanji for use in personal names}} consist of 3,119 characters, containing the ''jōyō kanji'' plus an additional 983 kanji found in people's names. There were only 92 kanji in the original list published in 1952, but new additions have been made frequently. Sometimes the term ''jinmeiyō kanji'' refers to all 3,119, and sometimes it only refers to the 983 that are only used for names.

===Hyōgai kanji===
{{Main|Hyōgai kanji}}
{{Nihongo||表外漢字|Hyōgai kanji|"unlisted characters"}} are any kanji not contained in the ''jōyō kanji'' and ''jinmeiyō kanji'' lists. These are generally written using traditional characters, but [[extended shinjitai]] forms exist.

===Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji===
The [[Japanese Industrial Standards]] for kanji and kana define character code-points for each kanji and kana, as well as other forms of writing such as the [[Latin alphabet]], [[Cyrillic script]], [[Greek alphabet]], [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]], etc. for use in information processing. They have had numerous revisions. The current standards are:
*[[JIS X 0208]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050522084722/http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanji90#kanji90 JIS X 0208:1997].&lt;/ref&gt; the most recent version of the main standard. It has 6,355 kanji.
*[[JIS X 0212]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050522084722/http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanjisup#kanjisup JIS X 0212:1990].&lt;/ref&gt; a supplementary standard containing a further 5,801 kanji. This standard is rarely used, mainly because the common [[Shift JIS]] encoding system could not use it. This standard is effectively obsolete;
*[[JIS X 0213]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050522084722/http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanji00#kanji00 JIS X 0213:2000].&lt;/ref&gt; a further revision which extended the JIS X 0208 set with 3,695 additional kanji, of which 2,743 (all but 952) were in JIS X 0212. The standard is in part designed to be compatible with Shift JIS encoding;
*JIS X 0221:1995, the Japanese version of the ISO 10646/[[Unicode]] standard.

====Gaiji====
{{Nihongo||外字|Gaiji|literally "external characters"}} are kanji that are not represented in existing Japanese [[Character encoding|encoding systems]]. These include variant forms of common kanji that need to be represented alongside the more conventional [[glyph]] in reference works, and can include non-kanji symbols as well.

''Gaiji'' can be either user-defined characters or system-specific characters. Both are a problem for information interchange, as the [[code point]] used to represent an external character will not be consistent from one computer or operating system to another.

''Gaiji'' were nominally prohibited in JIS X 0208-1997, and JIS X 0213-2000 used the range of code-points previously allocated to ''gaiji'', making them completely unusable. Nevertheless, they persist today with [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s "[[i-mode]]" service, where they are used for [[emoji]] (pictorial characters).

[[Unicode]] allows for optional encoding of ''gaiji'' in [[Private Use (Unicode)|private use areas]], while [[OpenType#SING gaiji solution|Adobe's SING]] (Smart INdependent Glyphlets)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Adobe | url = https://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=2437 | title = Introducing the SING Gaiji architecture}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Adobe | url = https://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/ | title = OpenType Technology Center}}.&lt;/ref&gt; technology allows the creation of customized gaiji.

The [[Text Encoding Initiative]] uses a '''&lt;g&gt;''' element to encode any non-standard character or glyph, including gaiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = TEI-C | url = http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/WD.html | chapter = Representation of Non-standard Characters and Glyphs | title = P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (The '''g''' stands for "gaiji")&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = TEI-C | url = http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-g.html | chapter = TEI element g (character or glyph) | title = P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Total number of kanji==
There is no definitive count of kanji characters, just as there is none of Chinese characters generally. The ''[[Dai Kan-Wa Jiten]]'', which is considered to be comprehensive in Japan,  contains about 50,000 characters. The ''[[Zhonghua Zihai]]'', published in 1994 in China contains about 85,000 characters;&lt;ref name=taipei&gt;Kuang-Hui Chiu, Chi-Ching Hsu (2006). [http://www.ntpu.edu.tw/ads/doc/95/paper%20hsu95.doc Chinese Dilemmas : How Many Ideographs are Needed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717015011/http://www.ntpu.edu.tw/ads/doc/95/paper%20hsu95.doc |date=July 17, 2011 }}, National Taipei University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shouhui Zhao, Dongbo Zhang, [http://www.colips.org/journals/volume17/JCLC_2007_V17_N2_04.pdf The Totality of Chinese Characters—A Digital Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel G. Peebles, [http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/TR2007-592.pdf SCML: A Structural Representation for Chinese Characters], May 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; however, the majority of these are not in common use in any country, and many are obscure variants or archaic forms.

Approximately 2,000 to 3,000 characters are commonly used in Japan, a few thousand more find occasional use, and a total of 13,108 characters can be encoded in various [[#Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji|Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji]].

Because of the way they have been adopted into Japanese, a single kanji may be used to write one or more different words—or, in some cases, [[morphemes]]—and thus the same character may be pronounced in different ways. From the point of view of the reader, kanji are said to have one or more different "readings". Although more than one reading may become activated in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2013.773050|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236062398_The_multiple_pronunciations_of_Japanese_kanji_A_masked_priming_investigation| pmid = 23510000| title = The multiple pronunciations of Japanese kanji: A masked priming investigation| journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology| volume = 66| issue = 10| pages = 2023| year = 2013| last1 = Verdonschot | first1 = R.

O. }}&lt;/ref&gt; deciding which reading is appropriate depends on recognizing which word it represents, which can usually be determined from context, intended meaning, whether the character occurs as part of a compound word or an independent word, and sometimes location within the sentence. For example, {{lang|ja|今日}} is usually read ''kyō'', meaning "today", but in formal writing is instead read ''konnichi'', meaning "nowadays"; this is understood from context. Nevertheless, some cases are ambiguous and require a ''[[furigana]]'' gloss, which are also used simply for difficult readings or to specify a non-standard reading.

Kanji readings are categorized as either ''on'yomi'' (literally "sound reading", from Chinese) or ''kun'yomi'' (literally "meaning reading", native Japanese), and most characters have at least two readings, at least one of each. However, some characters have only a single reading, such as {{Nihongo||菊|kiku|"chrysanthemum", an ''on''-reading}} or {{Nihongo||鰯|iwashi|"sardine", a ''kun''-reading}}; ''kun''-only are common for Japanese-coined kanji (''kokuji''). Some common kanji have ten or more possible readings; the most complex common example is {{Nihongo2|生}}, which is read as ''sei, shō, nama, ki, o-u, i-kiru, i-kasu, i-keru, u-mu, u-mareru, ha-eru'', and ''ha-yasu'', totaling 8 basic readings (first 2 are ''on'', rest are ''kun''), or 12 if related verbs are counted as distinct; see [[Okurigana#生|okurigana: 生]] for details.

Most often, a character will be used for both sound and meaning, and it is simply a matter of choosing the correct reading based on which word it represents. In other cases, a character is used only for sound (''[[ateji]]''). In this case, pronunciation is still based on a standard reading, or used only for meaning (broadly a form of ''ateji'', narrowly ''jukujikun''). Therefore, only the full compound—not the individual character—has a reading. There are also [[#Special readings|special cases]] where the reading is completely different, often based on an historical or traditional reading.

The analogous phenomenon occurs to a much lesser degree in [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]], where there are [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]]—borrowed readings and native readings. In Chinese these borrowed readings and native readings are etymologically related, since they are between Chinese varieties (which are related), not from Chinese to Japanese (which are not related). They thus form [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] and are generally similar, analogous to different on'yomi, reflecting different stages of Chinese borrowings into Japanese.

===''On'yomi'' (Sino-Japanese reading) {{anchor|on'yomi|on-yomi|onyomi|on'yomi (Chinese reading)}} &lt;!-- for redirects and direct links to older section names --&gt; ===
The {{Nihongo||音読み|'''on'yomi'''|literally "sound(-based) reading"}}, the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] reading, is the modern descendant of the Japanese approximation of the base Chinese pronunciation of the character at the time it was introduced. It was often previously referred to as '''translation reading''', as it was recreated readings of the Chinese pronunciation but was not the Chinese pronunciation or reading itself, similar to the English pronunciation of Latin loanwords. Old Japanese scripts often stated that ''on'yomi'' readings were also created by the Japanese during their arrival and re-borrowed by the Chinese as their own. There also exist kanji created by the Japanese and given an ''on'yomi'' reading despite not being a Chinese-derived or a Chinese-originating character. Some kanji were introduced from different parts of China at different times, and so have multiple ''on'yomi'', and often multiple meanings. ''Kanji'' invented in Japan would not normally be expected to have ''on'yomi'', but there are exceptions, such as the character {{Nihongo2|働}} "to work", which has the ''kun'yomi'' "''hataraku''" and the ''on'yomi'' "''dō''", and {{Nihongo2|腺}} "gland", which has only the ''on'yomi'' "''sen''"—in both cases these come from the ''on'yomi'' of the phonetic component, respectively {{Nihongo2|動}} "''dō''" and {{Nihongo2|泉}} "''sen''".

Generally, ''on'yomi'' are classified into four types according to their region and time of origin:
*{{Nihongo||呉音|'''[[Go-on]]'''|"Wu sound"}} readings are from the pronunciation during the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] of China during the 5th and 6th centuries. ''Go'' refers to the [[Wu (region)|Wu]] region (in the vicinity of modern [[Shanghai]]), which still maintains linguistic similarities with modern Sino-Japanese vocabulary.
*{{Nihongo||漢音|'''[[Kan-on]]'''|"Han sound"}} readings are from the pronunciation during the [[Tang dynasty]] of China in the 7th to 9th centuries, primarily from the standard speech of the capital, [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]). Here, ''Kan'' refers to [[Han Chinese]] or [[China proper]].
*{{Nihongo||唐音|'''[[Tō-on]]'''|"Tang sound"}} readings are from the pronunciations of later dynasties of China, such as the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]. They cover all readings adopted from the [[Heian era]] to the [[Edo period]]. This is also known as {{Nihongo||唐宋音|Tōsō-on|Tang and Song sound}}.
*{{anchor|kan'yō-on|kan'yōon|kan'you-on}} {{Nihongo||慣用音|'''Kan'yō-on'''|"customary sound"}} readings, which are mistaken or changed readings of the kanji that have become accepted into Japanese language. In some cases, they are the actual readings that accompanied the character's introduction to Japan, but do not match how the character [[linguistic prescription|"should"]] be read according to the rules of character construction and pronunciation.

The most common form of readings is the ''kan-on'' one, and use of a non-''kan-on'' reading in a word where the ''kan-on'' reading is well-known is a common cause of reading mistakes or difficulty, such as in {{Nihongo||解毒|ge-doku|detoxification, anti-poison}} (''go-on''), where {{Nihongo2|解}} is usually instead read as ''kai''. The ''go-on'' readings are especially common in [[Buddhist]] terminology such as {{Nihongo||極楽|gokuraku|paradise}}, as well as in some of the earliest loans, such as the Sino-Japanese numbers. The ''tō-on'' readings occur in some later words, such as {{Nihongo||椅子|isu|chair}}, {{Nihongo||布団|[[futon]]|mattress}}, and {{Nihongo||行灯|andon|a kind of paper lantern}}. The go-on, kan-on, and tō-on readings are generally [[cognate]] (with rare exceptions of homographs; see below), having a common origin in [[Old Chinese]], and hence form [[doublet (linguistics)|linguistic doublets]] or triplets, but they can differ significantly from each other and from modern Chinese pronunciation.

In Chinese, most characters are associated with a single Chinese sound, though there are distinct [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|literary and colloquial readings]]. However, some homographs ({{lang|zh|多音字}} {{zh|p=duōyīnzì}}) such as {{lang|zh|行}} (''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|háng}}'' or ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|xíng}}'') (Japanese: ''an, gō, gyō'')&lt;!--in go'on. in kan'on, both are ''kō''--&gt; have more than one reading in Chinese representing different meanings, which is reflected in the carryover to Japanese as well. Additionally, many Chinese syllables, especially those with an [[entering tone]], did not fit the largely consonant-vowel (CV) [[phonotactics]] of classical Japanese. Thus most ''on'yomi'' are composed of two [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] (beats), the second of which is either a lengthening of the vowel in the first mora (to ''ei'', ''ō'', or ''ū''), the vowel ''i''&lt;!--eg. ''ai'', ''sui''--&gt;, or one of the syllables ''ku'', ''ki'', ''tsu'', ''chi'', ''fu'' (historically, later merged into ''ō''), or moraic ''n'', chosen for their approximation to the final consonants of Middle Chinese. It may be that [[Yōon|palatalized consonants before vowels other than ''i'']] developed in Japanese as a result of Chinese borrowings, as they are virtually unknown in words of native Japanese origin, but are common in Chinese.

''On'yomi'' primarily occur in {{nihongo|multi-kanji compound words|熟語|jukugo}} words, many of which are the result of the adoption, along with the kanji themselves, of Chinese words for concepts that either did not exist in Japanese or could not be articulated as elegantly using native words. This borrowing process is often compared to the [[List of English words with dual French and Anglo-Saxon variations|English borrowings from Latin, Greek, and Norman French]], since Chinese-borrowed terms are often more specialized, or considered to sound more erudite or formal, than their native counterparts (occupying a higher [[linguistic register]]).  The major exception to this rule is [[Japanese family name|family name]]s, in which the native ''kun'yomi'' are usually used (though ''on'yomi'' are found in many personal names, especially men's names).

=== ''Kun'yomi'' (native reading)  {{anchor|kun'yomi|kun-yomi|kunyomi|Japanese reading|native reading}} ===
The {{Nihongo||訓読み|'''kun'yomi'''|{{abbr|lit.|literally}} "meaning reading"}}, the native reading, is a reading based on the pronunciation of a native [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word, or ''[[yamato kotoba]]'', that closely approximated the meaning of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] character when it was introduced. As with ''on'yomi'', there can be multiple ''kun'yomi'' for the same kanji, and some kanji have no ''kun'yomi'' at all.

For instance, the character for [[east]], {{Nihongo2|[[wikt:東|東]]}}, has the ''on'yomi'' ''tō'', from [[Middle Chinese]] ''{{IPA|tung}}''. However, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] already had two words for "east": ''higashi'' and ''azuma''. Thus the kanji {{lang|ja|東}} had the latter readings added as ''kun'yomi''. In contrast, the kanji {{lang|ja|[[Cun (length)|寸]]}}, denoting a Chinese unit of measurement (about 30&amp;nbsp;mm or 1.2&amp;nbsp;inch), has no native [[Japanese language|Japanese]] equivalent; it only has an ''on'yomi'', ''[[Cun (length)|sun]]'', with no native ''kun'yomi''. Most ''[[kokuji]]'', Japanese-created Chinese characters, only have ''kun'yomi'', although some have back-formed a pseudo-''on'yomi'' by analogy with similar characters, such as {{Nihongo2|働}} ''dō'', from {{Nihongo2|動}} ''dō'', and there are even some, such as {{Nihongo2|腺}} ''sen'' "gland", that have only an ''on'yomi''.

''Kun'yomi'' are characterized by the strict (C)V syllable structure of ''yamato kotoba''. Most noun or adjective ''kun'yomi'' are two to three syllables long, while verb ''kun'yomi'' are usually between one and three syllables in length, not counting trailing [[hiragana]] called ''[[okurigana]]''. ''Okurigana'' are not considered to be part of the internal reading of the character, although they are part of the reading of the word. A beginner in the language will rarely come across characters with long readings, but readings of three or even four syllables are not uncommon. This contrasts with ''on'yomi'', which are monosyllabic, and is unusual in the [[Chinese family of scripts]], which generally use one character per syllable—not only in Chinese, but also in Korean, Vietnamese, and Zhuang; [[polysyllabic Chinese character]]s are rare and considered non-standard.

{{Nihongo2|承る}} ''uketamawaru'',  {{Nihongo2|志}} ''kokorozashi'', and {{Nihongo2|詔}} ''mikotonori'' have five syllables represented by a single kanji, the longest readings in the [[Jōyō kanji|''jōyō'' character set]]. These unusually long readings are due to a single character representing a compound word:

* {{lang|ja|承る}} is a single character for a compound verb, one component of which has a long reading.
** It has an alternative spelling as {{lang|ja|受け賜る}} ''u(ke)-tamawa(ru)'', hence (1+1)+3=5.
** Compare common {{lang|ja|受け付ける}} ''u(ke)-tsu(keru)''.
* {{lang|ja|志}} is a nominalization of the verb {{lang|ja|志す}} which has a long reading ''kokoroza(su)''.
** This is due to its being derived from a noun-verb compound, {{lang|ja|心指す}} ''kokoro-za(su)''.
** The nominalization removes the okurigana, hence increasing the reading by one mora, yielding 4+1=5.
** Compare common {{lang|ja|話}} ''hanashi'' 2+1=3, from {{lang|ja|話す}} ''hana(su)''.
* {{lang|ja|詔}} is a triple compound.
** It has an alternative spelling {{lang|ja|御言宣}} ''mi-koto-nori'', hence 1+2+2=5.

Longer readings exist for non-Jōyō characters and non-kanji symbols, where a long [[gairaigo]] word may be the reading (this is classed as ''kun'yomi''—see [[#Single character gairaigo|single character gairaigo]], below)—the character {{Nihongo2|糎}} has the seven kana reading {{lang|ja-Kana|センチメートル}} ''senchimētoru'' "centimeter", though it is generally written as "cm" (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space); another common example is '%' (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading {{lang|ja-Kana|パーセント}} ''pāsento''. Further, some Jōyō characters have long non-Jōyō readings (students learn the character, but not the reading), such as ''omonpakaru'' for {{lang|ja|慮る}}.

In a number of cases, multiple kanji were assigned to cover a single [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word. Typically when this occurs, the different kanji refer to specific shades of meaning. For instance, the word {{lang|ja-Kana|なおす}}, ''naosu'', when written {{lang|ja|治す}}, means "to heal an illness or sickness". When written {{lang|ja|直す}} it means "to fix or correct something". Sometimes the distinction is very clear, although not always. Differences of opinion among reference works is not uncommon; one dictionary may say the kanji are equivalent, while another dictionary may draw distinctions of use. As a result, native speakers of the language may have trouble knowing which kanji to use and resort to personal preference or by writing the word in [[hiragana]]. This latter strategy is frequently employed with more complex cases such as もと ''moto'', which has at least five different kanji: {{lang|ja|元, 基, 本, 下}}, and {{lang|ja|素}}, the first three of which have only very subtle differences. Another notable example is ''sakazuki'' "sake cup", which may be spelt as at least five different kanji: {{lang|ja|杯, 盃, 巵/卮}}, and {{lang|ja|坏}}; of these, the first two are common—formally {{lang|ja|杯}} is a small cup and {{lang|ja|盃}} a large cup.

Local dialectical readings of kanji are also classified under ''kun'yomi'', most notably readings for words in [[Ryukyuan languages]]. Further, in rare cases gairaigo (borrowed words) have a single character associated with them, in which case this reading is formally classified as a ''kun'yomi'', because the character is being used for meaning, not sound. This is discussed under [[#Single character gairaigo|single character gairaigo]], below.

===Mixed readings {{anchor|jūbako|juubako|jubako|yutō|yutou|yuto}} ===
[[File:Jūbako.jpg|thumb|A {{Nihongo||重箱|jūbako}}, which has a mixed on-kun reading]]
[[File:Pail,yutou,soba-yu,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|A {{Nihongo||湯桶|yutō}}, which has a mixed kun-on reading]]
There are many kanji compounds that use a mixture of ''on'yomi'' and ''kun'yomi'', known as {{Nihongo||重箱読み|jūbako yomi|multi-layered food box}} or {{Nihongo||湯桶|yutō|hot liquid pail}} words (depending on the order), which are themselves examples of this kind of compound (they are [[autological word]]s): the first character of ''jūbako'' is read using ''on'yomi'', the second ''kun'yomi'' (''on-kun''). 
It is the other way around with ''yutō'' (''kun-on'').

Formally, these are referred to as {{Nihongo||重箱読み|jūbako-yomi|''jūbako'' reading}} and {{Nihongo||湯桶読み|yutō-yomi|''yutō'' reading}}. Note that in both these words, the ''on'yomi'' has a long vowel; long vowels in Japanese generally come from Chinese, hence distinctive of ''on'yomi''. These are the Japanese form of [[hybrid word]]s. Other examples include {{nihongo||場所|basho|"place", ''kun-on''}}, {{nihongo||金色|kin'iro|"golden", ''on-kun''}} and {{nihongo||合気道|aikidō|the martial art [[Aikido]]", ''kun-on-on''}}.

''Ateji'' often use mixed readings. For instance the city of [[Sapporo]], whose name derives from the [[Ainu language]] and has no meaning in Japanese, is written with the ''on-kun'' compound {{lang|ja|札幌}} (which includes ''[[sokuon]]'' as if it were a purely ''on'' compound).

===Special readings===
{{nihongo||{{linktext|義訓}}|{{visible anchor|Gikun}}}} and {{nihongo||{{linktext|熟字訓}}|{{visible anchor|jukujikun}}}} are readings of kanji combinations that have no direct correspondence to the characters' individual ''on'yomi'' or ''kun'yomi''. From the point of view of the character, rather than the word, this is known as a {{Nihongo||{{linktext|難訓}}|nankun|difficult reading}}, and these are listed in kanji dictionaries under the entry for the character.

''Gikun'' are when non-standard kanji are used, generally for effect, such as using {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|寒}}}} with reading ''fuyu'' ("winter"), rather than the standard character {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|冬}}}}.

''Jukujikun'' are when the standard kanji for a word are related to the meaning, but not the sound. The word is pronounced as a whole, not corresponding to sounds of individual kanji. For example, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|今朝}}}} ("this morning") is jukujikun, and read neither as *''ima'asa'', the ''kun'yomi'' of the characters, nor ''konchō'', the ''on'yomi'' of the characters, nor any combination thereof. Instead it is read as ''kesa'', a native bisyllabic Japanese word that may be seen as a single [[morpheme]], or as a fusion of ''kyō'' (previously ''kefu''), "today", and ''asa'', "morning". Likewise, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|明日}}}} ("tomorrow") is jukujikun, and read neither as ''akari(no)hi'', the ''kun'yomi'' of the characters, nor ''meinichi'', the ''on'yomi'' of the characters, nor any combination thereof. Instead it is read as ''ashita'', a native multisyllabic Japanese word that may be seen as a single [[morpheme]].

Jukujikun are primarily used for some native Japanese words, such as [[Yamato (disambiguation)|Yamato]]&lt;!-- intentional link to DAB page--&gt; ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|大和}}}} or {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|倭}}}}, the name of a Japanese province as well as ancient name for Japan), and for some old borrowings, such as {{Nihongo||{{linktext|柳葉魚}}|[[shishamo]]|willow leaf fish}} from Ainu, {{Nihongo||{{linktext|煙草}}|tabako|smoke grass}} from Portuguese, or ''bīru'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|麦酒}}}}, wheat alcohol) from Dutch, especially if the word was borrowed before the [[Meiji period|Meiji Period]]. Words whose kanji are jukujikun are often usually written as hiragana (if native), or katakana (if borrowed); some old borrowed words are also written as hiragana, especially Portuguese loanwords such as ''karuta'' ({{linktext|かるた}}) from Portuguese "carta" (Eng: card), ''tempura'' ({{linktext|てんぷら}}) from Portuguese "tempora" (Eng: time), and ''pan'' ({{linktext|ぱん}}) from Spanish "pan" (Eng: bread), as well as ''tabako'' ({{linktext|たばこ}}).

Sometimes, jukujikun can even have more kanji than there are syllables, examples being ''kera'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|啄木鳥}}}}, woodpecker), ''gumi'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|胡頽子}}}}, silver berry/oleaster),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/29056/how-many-possible-phonological-forms-could-be-represented-by-a-randomly-chosen-s|title=How many possible phonological forms could be represented by a randomly chosen single character?|website=japanese.stackexchange.com|access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Hozumi'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|八月朔日}}}}, a surname).&lt;ref name="How do Japanese names work"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/names-for-people.html|title=How do Japanese names work?|website=www.sljfaq.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jukujikun are quite varied. Often the kanji compound for jukujikun is idiosyncratic and created for the word, and where the corresponding Chinese word does not exist; in other cases a kanji compound for an existing Chinese word is reused, where the Chinese word and ''on'yomi'' may or may not be used in Japanese; for example, {{Nihongo||{{linktext|馴鹿}}||reindeer}} is jukujikun for ''tonakai'', from Ainu, but the ''on'yomi'' reading of ''junroku'' is also used. In some cases Japanese coinages have subsequently been borrowed back into  Chinese, such as {{Nihongo||{{linktext|鮟鱇}}|ankō|monkfish}}.

The underlying word for jukujikun is a native Japanese word or foreign borrowing, which either does not have an existing kanji spelling (either ''kun'yomi'' or ''ateji'') or for which a new kanji spelling is produced. Most often the word is a noun, which may be a simple noun (not a compound or derived from a verb), or may be a verb form or a fusional pronunciation; for example {{Nihongo||{{linktext|相撲}}|sumō|[[sumo]]}} is originally from the verb {{Nihongo||{{linktext|争う}}|suma-u|to vie}}, while {{Nihongo||{{linktext|今日}}|kyō|today}} is fusional. In rare cases jukujikun is also applied to inflectional words (verbs and adjectives), in which case there is frequently a corresponding Chinese word.

Examples of jukujikun for inflectional words follow. The most common example of a jukujikun adjective is {{Nihongo||{{linktext|可愛い}}|kawai-i|cute}}, originally ''kawayu-i;'' the word {{Nihongo||{{linktext|可愛}}}} is used in Chinese, but the corresponding ''on'yomi'' is not used in Japanese. By contrast, "appropriate" can be either {{Nihongo||{{linktext|相応しい}}|fusawa-shii|in jukujikun}} or {{Nihongo||{{linktext|相応}}|sōō|in ''on'yomi''}} are both used; the ''-shii'' ending is because these were formerly a different class of adjectives. A common example of a verb with jukujikun is {{Nihongo||{{linktext|流行る}}|haya-ru|to spread, to be in vogue}}, corresponding to ''on'yomi'' {{Nihongo||{{linktext|流行}}|ryūkō}}. A sample jukujikun deverbal (noun derived from a verb form) is {{Nihongo||{{linktext|強請}}|yusuri|extortion}}, from {{Nihongo||{{linktext|強請る}}|yusu-ru|to extort}}, spelling from {{Nihongo||{{linktext|強請}}|kyōsei|extortion}}. See [[:ja:義訓#義訓|義訓]] and [[:ja:熟字訓|熟字訓]] for many more examples. Note that there are also compound verbs and, less commonly, compound adjectives, and while these may have multiple kanji without intervening characters, they are read using usual ''kun'yomi;'' examples include {{Nihongo||{{linktext|面白い}}|omo-shiro-i|interesting|face-whitening}} and {{Nihongo||{{linktext|狡賢い}}|zuru-gashiko-i|sly}}.

Typographically, the [[furigana]] for jukujikun are often written so they are centered across the entire word, or for inflectional words over the entire root—corresponding to the reading being related to the entire word—rather than each part of the word being centered over its corresponding character, as is often done for the usual phono-semantic readings.

Broadly speaking, jukujikun can be considered a form of ''[[ateji]]'', though in narrow usage "ateji" refers specifically to using characters for sound and not meaning (sound-spelling), rather than meaning and not sound (meaning-spelling), as in jukujikun.

Many jukujikun (established meaning-spellings) began life as gikun (improvised meaning-spellings). Occasionally a single word will have many such kanji spellings; an extreme example is {{nihongo|||hototogisu|[[Lesser Cuckoo|lesser cuckoo]]}}, which may be spelt in a great many ways, including {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|杜鵑}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|時鳥}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|子規}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|不如帰}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|霍公鳥}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|蜀魂}}}},  {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|沓手鳥}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|杜宇}}}},{{Nihongo2|{{linktext|田鵑}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|沓直鳥}}}}, and {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|郭公}}}}—many of these variant spellings are particular to [[haiku]] poems.

===Single character gairaigo===
In some rare cases, an individual kanji has a reading that is borrowed from a modern foreign language ([[gairaigo]]), though most often these words are written in katakana. Notable examples include {{nihongo||頁、ページ|pēji|page}}, {{nihongo||釦／鈕、ボタン|botan|button}}, {{nihongo||零、ゼロ|zero|zero}}, and {{nihongo||米、メートル|mētoru|meter}}. See [[wikt:Appendix:Single character gairaigo|list of single character gairaigo]] for more. These are classed as ''kun'yomi'' of a single character, because the character is being used for meaning only (without the Chinese pronunciation), rather than as [[ateji]], which is the classification used when a gairaigo term is written as a compound (2 or more characters). However, unlike the vast majority of other ''kun'yomi'', these readings are not native Japanese, but rather borrowed, so the "kun'yomi" label can be misleading. The readings are also written in katakana, unlike the usual hiragana for native ''kun'yomi''. Note that most of these characters are for units, particularly [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|SI units]], in many cases using new characters ([[kokuji]]) coined during the [[Meiji period]], such as {{nihongo||粁、キロメートル|kiromētoru|kilometer, {{Nihongo2|米}} "meter" + {{Nihongo2|千}} "thousand"}}.

===Other readings===
Some kanji also have lesser-known readings called ''[[nanori]]'' ({{Nihongo2|名乗り}}), which are mostly used for names (often [[given name]]s) and in general, are closely related to the ''kun'yomi''. Place names sometimes also use ''nanori'' or, occasionally, unique readings not found elsewhere.

For example, there is the surname {{lang|ja|小鳥遊}} (literally, "little birds at play") that implies there are no predators, such as hawks, present. Pronounced, "''kotori asobu''". The name then can also mean {{lang|ja|鷹がいない}} (''taka ga inai'', literally, "no hawks around") and it can be shortened to be pronounced as ''Takanashi''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myoji-yurai.net/searchResult.htm?myojiKanji=小鳥遊 {{Nihongo2|【名字】小鳥遊}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===When to use which reading===
Although there are general rules for when to use ''on'yomi'' and when to use ''kun'yomi'', the language is littered with exceptions, and it is not always possible for even a native speaker to know how to read a character without prior knowledge (this is especially true for names, both of people and places); further, a given character may have multiple ''kun'yomi'' or ''on'yomi''. When reading Japanese, one primarily recognizes ''words'' (multiple characters and okurigana) and their readings, rather than individual characters, and only guess readings of characters when trying to "sound out" an unrecognized word.

Homographs exist, however, which can sometimes be deduced from context, and sometimes cannot, requiring a glossary.  For example, {{Nihongo2|今日}} may be read either as ''kyō'' "today (informal)" (special fused reading for native word) or as ''konnichi'' "these days (formal)" (''on'yomi''); in formal writing this will generally be read as ''konnichi''. In some cases multiple readings are common, as in {{Nihongo2|豚汁}} "pork soup", which is commonly pronounced both as ''ton-jiru'' (mixed ''on-kun'') and ''buta-jiru'' (''kun-kun''), with ''ton'' somewhat more common nationally. Inconsistencies abound—for example {{Nihongo2|牛肉}} ''gyū-niku'' "beef" and {{Nihongo2|羊肉}} ''yō-niku'' "mutton" have ''on-on'' readings, but {{Nihongo2|豚肉}} ''buta-niku'' "pork" and {{Nihongo2|鶏肉}} ''tori-niku'' "poultry" have ''kun-on'' readings.

The main guideline is that a single kanji followed by ''okurigana'' (hiragana characters that are part of the word)—as used in native verbs and adjectives—''always'' indicates ''kun'yomi'', while kanji compounds (kango) usually use ''on'yomi'', which is usually ''kan-on;'' however, other ''on'yomi'' are also common, and ''kun'yomi'' are also commonly used in kango. For a kanji in isolation without okurigana, it is typically read using their ''kun'yomi'', though there are numerous exceptions. For example, {{Nihongo2|鉄}} "iron" is usually read with the ''on'yomi'' ''tetsu'' rather than the ''kun'yomi'' ''kurogane''. Chinese ''on'yomi'' which are not the common ''kan-on'' reading are a frequent cause of difficulty or mistakes when encountering unfamiliar words or for inexperienced readers, though skilled natives will recognize the word; a good example is {{Nihongo||解毒|ge-doku|detoxification, anti-poison}} (''go-on''), where {{Nihongo||解}} is usually instead read as ''kai''.

[[Okurigana]] are used with ''kun'yomi'' to mark the inflected ending of a native verb or adjective, or by convention. Note that Japanese verbs and adjectives are [[closed class]], and do not generally admit new words (borrowed Chinese vocabulary, which are nouns, can form verbs by adding {{Nihongo||〜する|-suru|to do}} at the end, and adjectives via {{Nihongo2|〜の}} ''-no'' or {{Nihongo2|〜な}} ''-na'', but cannot become native Japanese vocabulary, which inflect). For example: {{Nihongo2|赤い}} ''aka-i'' "red", {{Nihongo2|新しい}} ''atara-shii'' "new", {{Nihongo2|見る}} ''mi-ru'' "(to) see". Okurigana can be used to indicate which ''kun'yomi'' to use, as in {{Nihongo2|食べる}} ''ta-beru'' versus {{Nihongo2|食う}} ''ku-u'' (casual), both meaning "(to) eat", but this is not always sufficient, as in {{Nihongo2|開く}}, which may be read as ''a-ku'' or ''hira-ku'', both meaning "(to) open". {{Nihongo2|生}} is a particularly complicated example, with multiple ''kun'' and ''on'yomi''—see [[Okurigana#生|okurigana: 生]] for details. Okurigana is also used for some nouns and adverbs, as in {{Nihongo2|情け}} ''nasake'' "sympathy",  {{Nihongo2|必ず}} ''kanarazu'' "invariably", but not for {{Nihongo2|金}} ''kane'' "money", for instance. [[Okurigana]] is an important aspect of kanji usage in Japanese; see that article for more information on ''kun'yomi'' orthography

{{anchor|jukugo|multi-kanji compound words}}
Kanji occurring in {{nihongo|compounds (multi-kanji words)|熟語|jukugo}} are generally read using ''on'yomi'', especially for four-character compounds (''[[yojijukugo]]''). Though again, exceptions abound, for example, {{Nihongo2|情報}} ''jōhō'' "information", {{Nihongo2|学校}} ''gakkō'' "school", and   {{Nihongo2|新幹線}} ''shinkansen'' "bullet train" all follow this pattern. This isolated kanji versus compound distinction gives words for similar concepts completely different pronunciations. {{Nihongo2|北}} "north" and {{Nihongo2|東}} "east" use the ''kun'yomi'' ''kita'' and ''higashi'', being stand-alone characters, but {{Nihongo2|北東}} "northeast", as a compound, uses the ''on'yomi'' ''hokutō''. This is further complicated by the fact that many kanji have more than one ''on'yomi'': {{Nihongo2|生}} is read as ''sei'' in {{Nihongo2|先生}} ''sensei'' "teacher" but as ''shō'' in {{Nihongo2|一生}} ''isshō'' "one's whole life". Meaning can also be an important indicator of reading; {{Nihongo2|易}} is read ''i'' when it means "simple", but as ''eki'' when it means "divination", both being ''on'yomi'' for this character.

These rules of thumb have many exceptions. ''Kun'yomi'' compound words are not as numerous as those with ''on'yomi'', but neither are they rare. Examples include {{Nihongo2|手紙}} ''tegami'' "letter", {{Nihongo2|日傘}} ''higasa'' "parasol", and the famous {{Nihongo2|神風}} ''[[kamikaze]]'' "divine wind". Such compounds may also have okurigana, such as {{Nihongo2|空揚げ}} (also written {{Nihongo2|唐揚げ}}) ''karaage'' "Chinese-style fried chicken" and {{Nihongo2|折り紙}} ''[[origami]]'', although many of these can also be written with the okurigana omitted (for example, {{Nihongo2|空揚}} or {{Nihongo2|折紙}}).

Similarly, some ''on'yomi'' characters can also be used as words in isolation: {{Nihongo2|愛}} ''ai'' "love", {{Nihongo2|禅}} ''[[Zen]]'', {{Nihongo2|点}} ''ten'' "mark, dot". Most of these cases involve kanji that have no ''kun'yomi'', so there can be no confusion, although exceptions do occur. Alone {{Nihongo2|金}} may be read as ''kin'' "gold" or as ''kane'' "money, metal"; only context can determine the writer's intended reading and meaning.

Multiple readings have given rise to a number of [[homograph]]s, in some cases having different meanings depending on how they are read. One example is {{Nihongo2|上手}}, which can be read in three different ways: ''jōzu'' (skilled), ''uwate'' (upper part), or ''kamite'' ([[Blocking (stage)#Stage directions|stage left/house right]]). In addition, {{Nihongo2|上手い}} has the reading ''umai'' (skilled). More subtly, {{Nihongo2|明日}} has three different readings, all meaning "tomorrow": ''ashita'' (casual), ''asu'' (polite), and ''myōnichi'' (formal). [[Furigana]] (reading glosses) is often used to clarify any potential ambiguities.

Conversely, in some cases homophonous terms may be distinguished in writing by different characters, but not so distinguished in speech, and hence potentially confusing. In some cases when it is important to distinguish these in speech, the reading of a relevant character may be changed. For example, {{Nihongo2|私立}} (privately established, esp. school) and {{Nihongo2|市立}} (city established) are both normally pronounced ''shi-ritsu;'' in speech these may be distinguished by the alternative pronunciations ''watakushi-ritsu'' and ''ichi-ritsu''. More informally, in legal jargon {{Nihongo2|前文}} "preamble" and {{Nihongo2|全文}} "full text" are both pronounced ''zen-bun'', so {{Nihongo2|前文}} may be pronounced ''mae-bun'' for clarity, as in "Have you memorized the preamble [not 'whole text'] of the constitution?". As in these examples, this is primarily using a ''kun'yomi'' for one character in a normally ''on'yomi'' term.

As stated above, [[#Mixed readings|''jūbako'' and ''yutō'' readings]] are also not uncommon. Indeed, all four combinations of reading are possible: ''on-on'', ''kun-kun'', ''kun-on'' and ''on-kun''.

Several famous place names, including [[names of Japan|those of Japan]] itself ({{Nihongo2|日本}} ''Nihon'' or sometimes ''Nippon''), those of some cities such as [[Tokyo]] ({{Nihongo2|東京}} ''Tōkyō'') and [[Kyoto]] ({{Nihongo2|京都}} ''Kyōto''), and those of the main islands [[Honshu]] ({{Nihongo2|本州}} ''Honshū''), [[Kyushu]] ({{Nihongo2|九州}} ''Kyūshū''), [[Shikoku]] ({{Nihongo2|四国}} ''Shikoku''), and [[Hokkaido]] ({{Nihongo2|北海道}} ''Hokkaidō'') are read with ''on'yomi''; however, the majority of Japanese place names are read with ''kun'yomi'': {{Nihongo2|大阪}} ''Ōsaka'', {{Nihongo2|青森}} ''[[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]]'', {{Nihongo2|箱根}} ''[[Hakone]]''. Names often use characters and readings that are not in common use outside of names. When characters are used as abbreviations of place names, their reading may not match that in the original. The [[Osaka]] ({{Nihongo2|大阪}}) and [[Kobe]] ({{Nihongo2|神戸}}) baseball team, the [[Hanshin Tigers|Hanshin]] ({{Nihongo2|阪神}}) Tigers, take their name from the ''on'yomi'' of the second kanji of ''Ōsaka'' and the first of ''Kōbe''. The name of the [[Keisei Narita Airport Line|Keisei]] ({{Nihongo2|京成}}) railway line—linking Tokyo ({{Nihongo2|東京}}) and [[Narita, Chiba|Narita]] ({{Nihongo2|成田}})—is formed similarly, although the reading of {{Nihongo2|京}} from {{Nihongo2|東京}} is ''kei'', despite ''kyō'' already being an ''on'yomi'' in the word ''Tōkyō''.

[[Japanese family name]]s are also usually read with ''kun'yomi'': {{Nihongo2|山田}} ''Yamada'', {{Nihongo2|田中}} ''Tanaka'', {{Nihongo2|鈴木}} ''Suzuki''. Japanese [[given name]]s often have very irregular readings. Although they are not typically considered ''jūbako'' or ''yutō'', they often contain mixtures of ''kun'yomi'', ''on'yomi'' and ''nanori'', such as {{Nihongo2|大助}} ''Daisuke'' [''on-kun''], {{Nihongo2|夏美}} ''Natsumi'' [''kun-on'']. Being chosen at the discretion of the parents, the readings of given names do not follow any set rules, and it is impossible to know with certainty how to read a person's name without independent verification. Parents can be quite creative, and rumours abound of children called {{Nihongo2|地球}} ''Āsu'' ("Earth") and {{Nihongo2|天使}} ''Enjeru'' ("Angel"); neither are common names, and have normal readings ''chikyū'' and ''tenshi'' respectively. Some common Japanese names can be written in multiple ways, e.g. Akira can be written as {{Nihongo2|亮}}, {{Nihongo2|彰}}, {{Nihongo2|明}}, {{Nihongo2|顕}}, {{Nihongo2|章}}, {{Nihongo2|聴}}, {{Nihongo2|光}}, {{Nihongo2|晶}}, {{Nihongo2|晄}}, {{Nihongo2|彬}}, {{Nihongo2|昶}}, {{Nihongo2|了}}, {{Nihongo2|秋良}}, {{Nihongo2|明楽}}, {{Nihongo2|日日日}}, {{Nihongo2|亜紀良}}, {{Nihongo2|安喜良}} and many other characters and kanji combinations not listed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ateji Archives |url = http://www.tofugu.com/tag/ateji/|website = Tofugu|access-date = 2016-02-18|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satoshi can be written as {{Nihongo2|聡}}, {{Nihongo2|哲}}, {{Nihongo2|哲史}}, {{Nihongo2|悟}}, {{Nihongo2|佐登史}}, {{Nihongo2|暁}}, {{Nihongo2|訓}}, {{Nihongo2|哲士}}, {{Nihongo2|哲司}}, {{Nihongo2|敏}}, {{Nihongo2|諭}}, {{Nihongo2|智}}, {{Nihongo2|佐登司}}, {{Nihongo2|總}}, {{Nihongo2|里史}}, {{Nihongo2|三十四}}, {{Nihongo2|了}}, {{Nihongo2|智詞}}, etc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jisho.org/search/Satoshi|title=Satoshi |website=jisho.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Haruka can be written as {{Nihongo2|遥}}, {{Nihongo2|春香}}, {{Nihongo2|晴香}}, {{Nihongo2|遥香}}, {{Nihongo2|春果}}, {{Nihongo2|晴夏}}, {{Nihongo2|春賀}}, {{Nihongo2|春佳}}, and several other possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jisho.org/search/Haruka|title=Haruka |website=jisho.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common patterns do exist, however, allowing experienced readers to make a good guess for most names. To alleviate any confusion on how to pronounce the names of other Japanese people, most official Japanese documents require Japanese to write their names in both kana and kanji.&lt;ref name="How do Japanese names work"/&gt;

Chinese place names and [[Chinese personal name]]s appearing in Japanese texts, if spelled in kanji, are almost invariably read with ''on'yomi''. Especially for older and well-known names, the resulting Japanese pronunciation may differ widely from that used by modern Chinese speakers. For example, [[Mao Zedong]]'s name is pronounced as {{nihongo||毛沢東|Mō Takutō}} in Japanese, and the name of the legendary Monkey King, [[Sun Wukong]], is pronounced ''[[Son Goku (Journey to the West)|Son Gokū]]'' ({{Nihongo2|孫悟空}}) in Japanese.

Today, Chinese names that are not well known in Japan are often spelled in [[katakana]] instead, in a form much more closely approximating the native Chinese pronunciation. Alternatively, they may be written in kanji with katakana furigana. Many such cities have names that come from non-[[Chinese languages]] like [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] or [[Manchu language|Manchu]]. Examples of such not-well-known Chinese names include:

Internationally renowned Chinese-named cities tend to imitate the older English pronunciations of their names, regardless of the kanji's ''on'yomi'' or the Mandarin or Cantonese pronunciation, and can be written in either katakana or kanji. Examples include:

Notes: 
*Guangzhou, the city, is pronounced ''Kōshū'', while Guangdong, its province, is pronounced ''Kanton'', not ''Kōtō'' (in this case, opting for a Tō-on reading rather than the usual Kan-on reading).
*Kaohsiung was originally pronounced ''Takao'' (or similar) in [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]] and Japanese. It received this written [[Kaohsiung#Etymology and names|name]] (kanji/Chinese) from Japanese, and later its spoken Mandarin name from the corresponding characters. The English name "Kaohsiung" derived from its Mandarin pronunciation. Today it is pronounced either カオシュン or タカオ in Japanese.
*Taipei is generally pronounced たいほく in Japanese.

In some cases the same kanji can appear in a given word with different readings. Normally this occurs when a character is duplicated and the reading of the second character has voicing (''[[rendaku]]''), as in {{lang|ja|人人}} ''hito-bito'' "people" (more often written with the [[iteration mark]] as {{Nihongo2|人々}}), but in rare cases the readings can be unrelated, as in {{nihongo||跳び跳ねる|tobi-haneru|"hop around", more often written {{lang|ja|飛び跳ねる}}}}.

===Pronunciation assistance===
Because of the ambiguities involved, kanji sometimes have their pronunciation for the given context spelled out in [[ruby character]]s known as ''[[furigana]]'', (small ''[[kana]]'' written above or to the right of the character) or ''kumimoji'' (small ''kana'' written in-line after the character). This is especially true in texts for children or foreign learners. It is also used in [[newspaper]]s and ''[[manga]]'' (comics) for rare or unusual readings, or for situations like the first time a character's name is given, and for characters not included in the officially recognized set of [[jōyō kanji|essential kanji]]. Works of fiction sometimes use ''furigana'' to create new "words" by giving normal kanji non-standard readings, or to attach a foreign word rendered in katakana as the reading for a kanji or kanji compound of the same or similar meaning.

===Spelling words===
Conversely, specifying a given kanji, or spelling out a kanji word—whether the pronunciation is known or not—can be complicated, due to the fact that there is not a commonly used standard way to refer to individual kanji (one does not refer to "kanji #237"), and that a given reading does not map to a single kanji—indeed there are many homophonous ''words'', not simply individual characters, particularly for ''kango'' (with ''on'yomi''). Easiest is to write the word out—either on paper or tracing it in the air—or look it up (given the pronunciation) in a dictionary, particularly an electronic dictionary; when this is not possible, such as when speaking over the phone or writing implements are not available (and tracing in air is too complicated), various techniques can be used. These include giving ''kun'yomi'' for characters—these are often unique—using a well-known word with the same character (and preferably the same pronunciation and meaning), and describing the character via its components. For example, one may explain how to spell the word {{Nihongo||香辛料|kōshinryō|spice}} via the words {{Nihongo||香り|kao-ri|fragrance}}, {{Nihongo||辛い|kara-i|spicy}}, and {{Nihongo||飲料|in-ryō|beverage}}—the first two use the ''kun'yomi'', the third is a well-known compound—saying "''kaori'', ''karai'', ''ryō'' as in ''inryō''."

===Dictionaries===
In dictionaries, both words and individual characters have readings glossed, via various conventions. Native words and Sino-Japanese vocabulary are glossed in hiragana (for both ''kun'' and ''on'' readings), while borrowings (''gairaigo'')—including modern borrowings from Chinese—are glossed in katakana; this is the standard writing convention also used in furigana. By contrast, readings for individual characters are conventionally written in katakana for ''on'' readings, and hiragana for ''kun'' readings. Kun readings may further have a separator to indicate which characters are okurigana, and which are considered readings of the character itself. For example, in the entry for {{Nihongo2|食}}, the reading corresponding to the basic verb {{Nihongo|''eat''|食べる|taberu}} may be written as {{lang|ja-Kana|た.べる}} (''ta.beru''), to indicate that ''ta'' is the reading of the character itself. Further, [[kanji dictionary|kanji dictionaries]] often list compounds including irregular readings of a kanji.

==Local developments and divergences from Chinese==
Since kanji are essentially Chinese ''[[Hanzi|hànzì]]'' used to write Japanese, the majority of characters used in modern Japanese still retain their Chinese meaning, physical resemblance with some of their modern [[traditional Chinese characters]] counterparts, and a degree of similarity with [[Classical Chinese]] pronunciation imported to Japan from 5th to 9th century. Nevertheless, after centuries of development, there is a notable number of kanji used in modern Japanese which have different meaning from ''hanzi'' used in modern Chinese. Such differences are the result of:
* the use of characters created in Japan,
* characters that have been given different meanings in Japanese, and 
* post-[[World War II]] simplifications (''[[shinjitai]]'') of the character.

Likewise, the process of [[simplified characters|character simplification]] in [[mainland China]] since the 1950s has resulted in the fact that Japanese speakers who have not studied Chinese may not recognize some simplified characters.

===Kokuji {{anchor|Wasei kanji}} ===
{{see also|Gukja|Chữ Nôm|Chinese family of scripts#Adaptations for other languages}}
In Japanese, {{nihongo||[[:ja:国字|国字]]|Kokuji|"national characters"}} refers to Chinese characters made outside of China. Specifically, kanji made in Japan are referred to as {{nihongo||和製漢字|Wasei kanji}}. They are primarily formed in the usual way of Chinese characters, namely by combining existing components, though using a combination that is not used in China. The corresponding phenomenon in Korea is called ''[[gukja]]'' ({{lang|ko|國字}}), a cognate name; there are however far fewer Korean-coined characters than Japanese-coined ones. [[Chinese family of scripts#Adaptations for other languages|Other languages]] using the [[Chinese family of scripts]] sometimes have far more extensive systems of native characters, most significantly Vietnamese [[chữ Nôm]], which comprises over 20,000 characters used throughout traditional Vietnamese writing, and [[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]] [[sawndip]], which comprises over 10,000 characters, which are still in use.

Since kokuji are generally devised for existing native words, these usually only have native [[Kun reading#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|''kun'' readings]]. However, they occasionally have a Chinese [[On reading#On'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading)|''on'' reading]], derived from a phonetic, as in {{Nihongo2|働}}, ''dō'', and in rare cases only have an ''on'' reading, as in {{Nihongo2|腺}}, ''sen'', from {{lang|ja|泉}}, which was derived for use in technical compounds ({{lang|ja|腺}} means "gland", hence used in medical terminology).

The majority of kokuji are [[Chinese character classification#Ideogrammatic compounds|ideogrammatic compounds]] ({{lang|ja|会意字}}), meaning that they are composed of two (or more) characters, with the meaning associated with the combination. For example, {{Nihongo2|働}} is composed of {{Nihongo2|亻}} (person radical) plus {{Nihongo2|動}} (action), hence "action of a person, work". This is in contrast to kanji generally, which are overwhelmingly phono-semantic compounds. This difference is because kokuji were coined to express Japanese words, so borrowing existing (Chinese) readings could not express these—combining existing characters to logically express the meaning was the simplest way to achieve this. Other illustrative examples (below) include {{lang|ja|榊}} ''[[sakaki]]'' tree, formed as {{Nihongo2|木}} "tree" and {{lang|ja|神}} "god", literally "divine tree", and {{lang|ja|辻}} ''tsuji'' "crossroads, street" formed as {{lang|ja|辶}} ({{Nihongo2|⻌}}) "road" and {{lang|ja|十}} "cross", hence "cross-road".

In terms of meanings, these are especially for natural phenomena (esp. [[flora]] and [[fauna]] [[species]]) that were not present in ancient China, including a very large number of fish, such as {{Nihongo2|鰯}} ([[sardine]]), {{Nihongo2|鱈}} ([[codfish]]), {{Nihongo2|鮴}} ([[Perch (disambiguation)|seaperch]]), and {{Nihongo2|鱚}} ([[sillago]]), and trees, such as {{Nihongo2|樫}} ([[evergreen oak]]), {{Nihongo2|椙}} ([[Japanese cedar]]), {{Nihongo2|椛}} ([[birch]], [[maple]]) and {{Nihongo2|柾}} ([[spindle tree]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tofugu.com/japanese/kokuji/?series=kanji|title=Kokuji: "Made In Japan," Kanji Edition|last=Koichi|date=2012-08-21|work=Tofugu|access-date=2017-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases they refer to specifically Japanese abstract concepts, everyday words (like {{Nihongo2|辻}}), or later technical coinages (such as {{Nihongo2|腺}}).

There are hundreds of ''kokuji'' in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = SLJ FAQ | url = http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kokuji-list.html | chapter = Kokuji list}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many are rarely used, but a number have become commonly used components of the written Japanese language. These include the following:

Jōyō kanji has about 9 kokuji; there is some dispute over classification, but generally includes these:
* {{Nihongo2|働}} {{lang|ja-Kana|どう}} ''dō'', {{lang|ja-Kana|はたら(く)}} ''hatara(ku)'' "work", the most commonly used kokuji, used in the fundamental verb {{nihongo||働く|hatara(ku)|"work"}}, included in elementary texts and on the [[Japanese Language Proficiency Test|Proficiency Test]] N5.
* {{Nihongo2|込}} {{lang|ja-Kana|こ(む)}} ''ko(mu)'', used in the fundamental verb {{nihongo||込む|komu|"to be crowded"}}
* {{Nihongo2|匂}} {{lang|ja-Kana|にお(う)}} ''nio(u)'', used in common verb {{nihongo||匂う|niou|"to smell, to be fragrant"}}
* {{Nihongo2|畑}} {{lang|ja-Kana|はたけ}} ''hatake'' "field of crops"
* {{Nihongo2|腺}} {{lang|ja-Kana|せん}} ''sen'', "gland"
* {{Nihongo2|峠}} {{lang|ja-Kana|とうげ}} ''tōge'' "mountain pass"
* {{Nihongo2|枠}} {{lang|ja-Kana|わく}} ''waku'', "frame"
* {{Nihongo2|塀}} {{lang|ja-Kana|へい}} ''hei'', "wall"
* {{Nihongo2|搾}} {{lang|ja-Kana|しぼ(る)}} ''shibo(ru)'', "to squeeze" (disputed; see below); a 
''jinmeiyō kanji''
* {{Nihongo2|榊}} {{lang|ja-Kana|さかき}} ''sakaki'' "tree, genus ''[[Sakaki|Cleyera]]''"
* {{Nihongo2|辻}} {{lang|ja-Kana|つじ}} ''tsuji'' "crossroads, street"
* {{Nihongo2|匁}} {{lang|ja-Kana|もんめ}} ''monme'' (unit of weight)
Hyōgaiji:
* {{Nihongo2|躾}} {{lang|ja-Kana|しつけ}} ''shitsuke'' "training, rearing (an animal, a child)"

Some of these characters (for example, {{Nihongo2|腺}}, "gland")&lt;ref&gt;Buck, James H. (October 15, 1969) "Some Observations on kokuji" in ''The Journal-Newsletter of the Association of Teachers of Japanese'', Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 45–9.&lt;/ref&gt; have been introduced to China. In some cases the Chinese reading is the inferred Chinese reading, interpreting the character as a phono-semantic compound (as in how ''on'' readings are sometimes assigned to these characters in Chinese), while in other cases (such as {{Nihongo2|働}}), the Japanese ''on'' reading is borrowed (in general this differs from the modern Chinese pronunciation of this phonetic). Similar coinages occurred to a more limited extent in Korea and Vietnam.

Historically, some kokuji date back to very early Japanese writing, being found in the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'', for example—{{Nihongo2|鰯}} ''iwashi'' "sardine" dates to the [[Nara period]] (8th century)—while they have continued to be created as late as the late 19th century, when a number of characters were coined in the [[Meiji era]] for new scientific concepts. For example, some characters were produced as regular compounds for some (but not all) SI units, such as {{Nihongo2|粁}} ({{Nihongo2|米}} "meter" + {{Nihongo2|千}} "thousand, kilo-") for kilometer, {{Nihongo2|竏}} ({{Nihongo2|立}} "liter" + {{Nihongo2|千}} "thousand, kilo-") for kiloliter, and {{Nihongo2|瓩}} ({{Nihongo2|瓦}} "gram" + "thousand, kilo-") for kilogram—see [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|Chinese characters for SI units]] for details. However, SI units in Japanese today are almost exclusively written using rōmaji or katakana such as {{Nihongo2|キロメートル}} or {{Nihongo2|㌖}} for km, {{Nihongo2|キロリットル}} for kl, and {{Nihongo2|キログラム}} or {{Nihongo2|㌕}} for kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kokuji-list.html|title=A list of kokuji (国字)|website=www.sljfaq.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan the kokuji category is strictly defined as characters whose ''earliest'' appearance is in Japan. If a character appears earlier in the Chinese literature, it is not considered a kokuji even if the character was independently coined in Japan and unrelated to the Chinese character (meaning "not borrowed from Chinese"). In other words, kokuji are not simply characters that were made in Japan, but characters that were ''first'' made in Japan. An illustrative example is {{Nihongo||鮟鱇|ankō|[[monkfish]]}}. This spelling was created in Edo period Japan from the [[ateji]] (phonetic kanji spelling) {{Nihongo2|安康}} for the existing word ''ankō'' by adding the {{Nihongo2|魚}} radical to each character—the characters were "made in Japan". However, {{Nihongo2|鮟}} is not considered kokuji, as it is found in ancient Chinese texts as a corruption of {{lang|zh-hant|鰋}} (魚匽). {{Nihongo2|鱇}} is considered kokuji, as it has not been found in any earlier Chinese text. Casual listings may be more inclusive, including characters such as {{Nihongo2|鮟}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kanjijiten.net/japanese.html {{Nihongo2|国字}}] at [http://www.kanjijiten.net/ {{Nihongo2|漢字辞典ネット}}] demonstrates this, listing both {{Nihongo2|鮟}} and {{Nihongo2|鱇}} as kokuji, but starring {{Nihongo2|鮟}} and stating that dictionaries do not consider it to be a kokuji.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is {{Nihongo2|搾}}, which is sometimes not considered kokuji due to its earlier presence as a corruption of Chinese {{lang|zh-hant|榨}}.

===Kokkun===
In addition to ''kokuji'', there are kanji that have been given meanings in Japanese different from their original Chinese meanings. These are not considered ''kokuji'' but are instead called ''kok{{zwnj}}[[#kunyomi|kun]]'' ({{Nihongo2|国訓}}) and include characters such as the following:

==Types of kanji by category==
{{Main|Chinese character classification}}
[[Han-dynasty]] scholar [[Xu Shen]] in his 2nd-century dictionary ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' classified Chinese characters into six categories ({{zh|c=六書}} ''liùshū'', Japanese: {{Nihongo2|六書}} ''rikusho''). The traditional classification is still taught but is problematic and no longer the focus of modern lexicographic practice, as some categories are not clearly defined, nor are they mutually exclusive: the first four refer to structural composition, while the last two refer to usage.

===''Shōkei moji'' ({{Nihongo2|象形文字}})===
''Shōkei'' (Mandarin: ''xiàngxíng'') characters are [[pictograph]]ic sketches of the object they represent. For example, {{Nihongo2|目}} is an eye, while {{Nihongo2|木}} is a tree. The current forms of the characters are very different from the originals, though their representations are more clear in [[oracle bone script]] and [[seal script]]. These pictographic characters make up only a small fraction of modern characters.

===''Shiji moji'' ({{Nihongo2|指事文字}})===
''Shiji'' (Mandarin: ''zhǐshì'') characters are [[ideograph]]s, often called "simple ideographs" or "simple indicatives" to distinguish them and tell the difference from compound ideographs (below). They are usually simple graphically and represent an abstract concept such as {{Nihongo2|上}} "up" or "above" and {{Nihongo2|下}} "down" or "below". These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters.

===''Kaii moji'' ({{Nihongo2|会意文字}})===
''Kaii'' (Mandarin: ''huìyì'') characters are compound ideographs, often called "compound indicatives", "associative compounds", or just "ideographs". These are usually a combination of pictographs that combine semantically to present an overall meaning. An example of this type is {{Nihongo2|休}} (rest) from {{Nihongo2|亻}} (person radical) and {{Nihongo2|木}} (tree).  Another is the ''kokuji'' {{Nihongo2|峠}} (mountain pass) made from {{Nihongo2|山}} (mountain), {{Nihongo2|上}} (up) and {{Nihongo2|下}} (down). These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters.

===''Keisei moji'' ({{Nihongo2|形声文字}})===
''Keisei'' (Mandarin: ''xíngshēng'') characters are phono-semantic or [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]-phonetic compounds, sometimes called "semantic-phonetic", "semasio-phonetic", or "phonetic-ideographic" characters, are by far the largest category, making up about 90% of the characters in the standard lists; however, some of the most frequently used kanji belong to one of the three groups mentioned above, so ''keisei moji'' will usually make up less than 90% of the characters in a text. Typically they are made up of two components, one of which (most commonly, but by no means always, the left or top element) suggests the general category of the meaning or semantic context, and the other (most commonly the right or bottom element) approximates the pronunciation. The pronunciation relates to the original Chinese, and may now only be distantly detectable in the modern Japanese ''on'yomi'' of the kanji; it generally has no relation at all to ''kun'yomi''. The same is true of the semantic context, which may have changed over the centuries or in the transition from Chinese to Japanese. As a result, it is a common error in folk etymology to fail to recognize a phono-semantic compound, typically instead inventing a compound-indicative explanation.

===''Tenchū moji'' ({{Nihongo2|転注文字}})===
''Tenchū'' (Mandarin: ''zhuǎnzhù'') characters have variously been called "derivative characters", "derivative [[cognate]]s", or translated as "mutually explanatory" or "mutually synonymous" characters; this is the most problematic of the six categories, as it is vaguely defined. It may refer to kanji where the meaning or application has become extended. For example, {{Nihongo2|楽}} is used for 'music' and 'comfort, ease', with different pronunciations in Chinese reflected in the two different ''on'yomi'', ''gaku'' 'music' and ''raku'' 'pleasure'.

===''Kasha moji'' ({{Nihongo2|仮借文字}})===
''Kasha'' (Mandarin: ''jiǎjiè'') are [[rebus]]es, sometimes called "phonetic loans". The etymology of the characters follows one of the patterns above, but the present-day meaning is completely unrelated to this. A character was appropriated to represent a similar-sounding word. For example, {{Nihongo2|来}} in ancient Chinese was originally a pictograph for "wheat". Its syllable was homophonous with the verb meaning "to come", and the character is used for that verb as a result, without any embellishing "meaning" element attached. The character for wheat {{Nihongo2|麦}}, originally meant "to come", being a ''keisei moji'' having 'foot' at the bottom for its meaning part and "wheat" at the top for sound. The two characters swapped meaning, so today the more common word has the simpler character. This borrowing of sounds has a very long history.

==Related symbols==
{{see also | Japanese typographic symbols}}

The [[iteration mark]] ({{Nihongo2|々}}) is used to indicate that the preceding kanji is to be repeated, functioning similarly to a [[ditto mark]] in English. It is pronounced as though the kanji were written twice in a row, for example {{Nihongo||{{linktext|色々}}|iroiro|"various"}} and {{Nihongo||時々|tokidoki|"sometimes"}}. This mark also appears in personal and place names, as in the [[Japanese name|surname]] Sasaki ({{lang|ja|佐々木}}). This symbol is a simplified version of the kanji {{Nihongo2|仝}}, a variant of {{Nihongo||同|dō|"same"}}.

Another abbreviated symbol is {{Nihongo2|[[ヶ]]}}, in appearance a small [[katakana]] "ke", but actually a simplified version of the kanji {{Nihongo2|箇}}, a general counter. It is pronounced "ka" when used to indicate quantity (such as {{lang|ja|六ヶ月}}, ''rok'''ka'''getsu'' "six months") or "ga" in place names like {{Nihongo|[[Kasumigaseki]]|霞ヶ関}}.

The way how these symbols may be produced on a computer depends on the operating system. In OS X, typing{{Nihongo2|「じおくり」}}will reveal the symbol {{Nihongo2|々}} as well as {{Nihongo2|ヽ}}, {{Nihongo2|ゝ}} and {{Nihongo2|ゞ}}. To produce {{Nihongo2|〻}}, type {{Nihongo2|「おどりじ」}}. Under Windows, typing{{Nihongo2|「くりかえし」}}will reveal some of these symbols, while in Google IME,{{Nihongo2|「おどりじ」}}may be used.

==Collation==
Kanji, whose thousands of symbols defy ordering by conventions such as those used for the [[Latin script]], are often [[collation|collated]] using the traditional Chinese [[radical-and-stroke sorting]] method. In this system, common components of characters are identified; these are called [[radical (Chinese character)|radicals]]. Characters are grouped by their primary radical, then ordered by number of pen strokes within radicals. For example, the kanji character {{Nihongo2|桜}}, meaning "cherry", is sorted as a ten-stroke character under the four-stroke primary radical {{lang|ja|木}} meaning "tree". When there is no obvious radical or more than one radical, convention governs which is used for collation.

Other kanji sorting methods, such as the [[Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary#SKIP|SKIP]] system, have been devised by various authors.

Modern general-purpose [[Japanese dictionaries]] (as opposed to specifically character dictionaries) generally collate all entries, including words written using kanji, according to their [[kana]] representations (reflecting the way they are pronounced). The [[gojūon]] ordering of kana is normally used for this purpose.

==Kanji education==
[[File:3002_Kanji.svg|thumb|An image that lists most joyo-kanji, according to [[Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary|Halpern's KKLD indexing system]], with kyo-iku kanji color-coded by grade level.]]

Japanese school children are expected to learn 1006 basic kanji characters, the ''[[kyōiku kanji]]'', before finishing the sixth grade. The order in which these characters are learned is fixed. The ''kyōiku kanji'' list is a subset of a larger list, originally of 1945 kanji characters, in 2010 extended to 2136, known as the ''[[jōyō kanji]]''—characters required for the level of fluency necessary to read newspapers and literature in Japanese. This larger list of characters is to be mastered by the end of the ninth grade.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, J. (2006) ''The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary''. {{ISBN|1568364075}}. p. 38a.&lt;/ref&gt; Schoolchildren learn the characters by repetition and [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]].

Students studying Japanese as a foreign language are often required by a curriculum to acquire kanji without having first learned the vocabulary associated with them. Strategies for these learners vary from copying-based methods to [[mnemonic]]-based methods such as those used in [[James Heisig]]'s series ''[[Remembering the Kanji]]''. Other textbooks use methods based on the [[etymology]] of the characters, such as Mathias and Habein's ''The Complete Guide to Everyday Kanji'' and Henshall's ''A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters''. Pictorial [[mnemonics]], as in the text ''Kanji Pict-o-graphix'', are also seen.

The [[Japanese government]] provides the ''[[Kanji kentei]]'' ({{Nihongo2|日本漢字能力検定試験}} ''Nihon kanji nōryoku kentei shiken''; "Test of Japanese Kanji Aptitude"), which tests the ability to read and write kanji. The highest level of the ''Kanji kentei'' tests about six thousand kanji.

{{redirect|Skullcup|other uses|Skull cup}}

A '''kapala''' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] for "skull") or '''skullcup''' is a cup made from a human skull and used as a ritual implement (bowl) in both [[Hindu]] [[Tantra]] and [[Buddhist]] [[Tantra]] ([[Vajrayana]]). Especially in Tibet, they are often carved or elaborately mounted with precious metals and jewels. 

[[Image:Kapala skull cup.jpg|thumb|right|Tibetan carved kapala]]

[[File:Kapala.JPG|thumbnail|Kapala]]

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
'Kapala' ({{bo|t=ཀ་པ་ལ|w=kapala}}) is a [[loan word]] into Tibetan from Sanskrit ''kapāla'' ([[Devanagari]]: कपाल) referring to the skull or forehead, usually of a human. By association, it refers to the ritual skullcup fashioned out of a human cranium.

== Vajrayana deities ==
[[Image:Chakrasamvara Vajravarahi.jpg|thumb|right|The Buddhist Deities [[Chakrasamvara]] and [[Vajravarahi]], circa 15th century Painting Kapala is seen on one of the left hands]]
Many of the deities of [[Vajrayana]], including [[mahasiddha]]s, [[dakini]]s and [[dharmapala]]s, are depicted as carrying the kapala, usually in their left hand. Some deities such as the Hindu [[Chinnamasta]] and the related Buddhist [[Vajrayogini]] are depicted as drinking blood from the kapala.&lt;ref&gt;Benard, Elisabeth Anne (1994). ''Chinnamasta: The Aweful Buddhist and Hindu Tantric Goddess''. Delhi: Motilal Barnarsidass. {{ISBN|81-208-1065-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hindu deities ==
Hindu deities that may be depicted with the kapala include [[Durga]], [[Kālī]] and [[Shiva]], especially in his [[Bhairava]] form. Even [[Ganesha]], when adopted into Tibetan Buddhism as Maharakta [[Ganapati]], is shown with a kapala filled with blood. 

Some of the Hindu deities pictured thus are:

a) [[Kālī]], pictured in the most common four-armed iconographic image, shows each hand carrying variously a sword, a [[trishula]] (trident), a severed head, and a bowl or skullcup (kapala) catching the blood of the severed head.

b) The [[Chamunda]], a form of [[Durga]], seen in the [[Halebidu]] temple built by the [[Hoysala]], is described as wearing a garland of severed heads or skulls ([[Mundamala]]). She is described as having four, eight, ten, or twelve arms, holding a [[damaru]] (drum), trishula (trident), sword, a snake ([[nāga]]), skull-mace ([[khatvanga]]), thunderbolt ([[vajra]]), a severed head and panapatra (drinking vessel, wine cup) or skullcup (kapala), filled with blood.

==Uses==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Kapala Mala courtesy The WOVENSOULS collection.jpg|thumb|Kapala Mala, 19th century, Tibet, courtesy of the Wovensouls collection]]

In Tibetan monasteries a kapala is used symbolically to hold bread or dough cakes, [[torma]], and wine instead of blood and flesh as offerings to wrathful deities, such as the ferocious [[Dharmapāla]] ("defender of the faith"). The dough cakes are shaped to resemble human eyes, ears and tongues. The ''kapala'' is made in the form of a skull, specially collected and prepared. It is elaborately anointed and consecrated before use. The cup is also elaborately decorated and kept in a triangular pedestal. The heavily embossed cup is usually made of [[silver-gilt]] bronze with lid shaped like a skull and with a handle made in the form of a thunderbolt.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9044643/kapala Kapala]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kapalas are used mainly for esoteric purposes such as rituals. Among the rituals using kapalas are higher tantric meditation to achieve a transcendental state of thought and mind within the shortest possible time; libation to gods and deities to win their favor; by Tibetan Lamas as an offering bowl on the altar, being filled with wine or blood as a gift to the Yidam Deity or all the Deities; and the [[Vajrayana]] empowerment ceremony.

== Charnel ground or sky burial ==
{{Main|Sky burial}}
The kapala is one of several charnel ground implements made from human bone found by tantrics at sky burial sites.
[[Image:Sky burial site, Yerpa Valley.JPG|thumb|left| Sky burial site in Yerpa valley in Tibet where kapalas are searched for by tantric practitioners]]

The charnel ground, an ancient Tibetan burial custom, is distinctly different from the customs of graveyards and cremation, but all three of them have been a part of the home ground of [[tantra|tantric]] practitioners’ such as the yogis and yoginis, Shaiva Kapalikas and Aghoris, shamans and sadhus. The charnel ground, often referred to as "sky burial" by Western sources, is an area demarcated specifically in Tibet, defined by the Tibetan word Jhator (literal meaning is ’giving alms to the birds’), a way of  exposing the corpse to nature, where human bodies are disposed as it were or in a chopped (chopped after the rituals) condition in the open ground as a ritual that has great religious meaning of the ascent of the mind to be reincarnated into another circle of life. Such a practice results in finding human bones, half or whole skeletons, more or less putrefying corpses and disattached limbs lying scattered around. Items made from human skulls or bones are found in the sky burial grounds by the [[Sadhus]] and Yogins of the tantric cult. The charnel grounds are also known by the epithets the "field of death" or the  "valley of corpses". In Tibet,  a class distinction in the burial practices is also noted. The dead High Lamas are buried in [[Stupa]]s or cremated but the dead commoners are disposed of in the Charnel ground or in a Sky burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/charnel_g.html|title=Charnel- and Cremation Grounds|first=Rufus C.|last=Camphausen|website=www.yoniversum.nl|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/tibet/sky-buria.htm|title=Sky Burial, Tibetan Religious Ritual, Funeral Party|website=www.travelchinaguide.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The products from the charnel ground are the charnel ground ornaments such as the i) Crown of five skulls, ii) Bone necklace, iii) Bone armlets, iv)  Bone bracelets, v) Bone skirt and vi) Bone anklets which decorate  many images of dakinis, yoginis, dharmapalas and a few other deities (as may be seen in some of the pictures and stone images depicted in the gallery here), and other products such as the Bone trumpet, the Skull cup and Skull drum used by the tantric practitioners. Kapala or the skull cup is thus a produce from the Charnel ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/charnel_o.html|title=Charnel Ground Ornaments and Implements|first=Rufus C.|last=Camphausen|website=www.yoniversum.nl|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lambert v. California''''', 355 U.S. 225 (1957), was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case regarding the defense of [[ignorance of the law]] when there is no legal [[notice]].&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law, 7th edition, 2012; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]]&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that, when one is required to register one's presence, failure to register may only be punished when there is a probability that the accused party had knowledge of the law before committing the crime of failing to register.

==Circumstances==
Lambert had previously been convicted of [[forgery]], a felony in [[California]]. She was unaware that a [[Los Angeles]] [[city ordinance]] required that she, being a felon, register if she remained in the city for more than five days. The ordinance stipulated that she, as a convicted criminal, could be fined $500 and sentenced to up to six months in jail for every day she remained in the city after the five-day limit. When she was arrested on suspicion of committing another offense she was convicted for failure to register. As Lambert was not allowed to use her lack of knowledge as a defense, she was convicted, fined $250 and sentenced to three years probation. Lambert appealed her case,  arguing that she had no knowledge that she had to register her name and  that convicting her would deprive her of [[due process]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref name="crimlaw"&gt;{{cite book |title=Criminal Law |last=Bonnie |first=Richard J. |authorlink= |author2=Coughlin, Anne M.  |year=1997 |publisher=The Foundation Press |location=Westbury, NY |isbn=978-1-56662-448-0 |pages=159&amp;ndash;161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
The Supreme Court reversed Lambert's conviction,  holding that knowledge or probability of knowledge of a statute is required to convict someone of a notice offense. [[William O. Douglas|Justice William Douglas]], who delivered the majority opinion for the court, wrote:
{{Quote|Where a person did not know of the duty to register and where there was no proof of the probability of such knowledge, he may not be convicted consistently with due process.&lt;ref name="crimlaw"/&gt;}}

However, the court did not overturn the right of states and municipalities to force occupants to register for a given purpose. The court held that because the ordinance that forced convicted felons to register was not accompanied by any action, nor were there circumstances that would lead a felon to be aware of his or her duty to register, the ordinance was unconstitutional. The Justice continued:
{{Quote|Registration laws are common, and their range is wide. Many such laws are akin to licensing statutes in that they pertain to the regulation of business activities. But the present ordinance is entirely different. Violation of its provisions is unaccompanied by any activity whatever, mere presence in the city being the test. Moreover, circumstances which might move one to inquire as to the necessity of registration are completely lacking. At most, the ordinance is but a law enforcement technique designed for the convenience of law enforcement agencies through which a list of the names and addresses of felons then residing in a given community is compiled. The disclosure is merely a compilation of former convictions already publicly recorded in the jurisdiction where obtained. Nevertheless, this appellant, on first becoming aware of her duty to register, was given no opportunity to comply with the law and avoid its penalty, even though her default was entirely innocent. She could but suffer the consequences of the ordinance, namely, conviction with the imposition of heavy criminal penalties thereunder. We believe that actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/355/225/case.html | title=Lambert v. California, 355 U.S. 225 (1957)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Significance==
This case is an exception to the legal principle ''[[ignorantia legis non excusat]]''—that the ignorance of the law is not a suitable excuse for breaking it. Because it deals with the motives (or lack thereof) for committing a crime, it addresses ''[[mens rea]]'', the degree of legal culpability that arises from the motivation of a criminal.

'''Letterlike Symbols''' is a [[Unicode block]] containing 80 [[character (computing)|character]]s which are constructed mainly from the [[glyph]]s of one or more [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s. In addition to this block, Unicode includes [[Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols|full styled mathematical alphabets]], although Unicode does not explicitly categorise these characters as being "letterlike".

==Emoji==
The Letterlike Symbols block contains two [[emoji]]:
U+2122 and U+2139.&lt;ref name="UTR51"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/|title=UTR #51: Unicode Emoji|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EmojiData"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/emoji-data.txt|title=UCD: Emoji Data for UTR #51|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The block has four [[Variant form (Unicode)|standardized variants]] defined to specify emoji-style (U+FE0F VS16) or text presentation (U+FE0E VS15) for the
two emoji, both of which default to a text presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/emoji-variation-sequences.txt|title=UTS #51 Emoji Variation Sequences | publisher=The Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{General geometry |0d/1d}}

The notion of '''line''' or '''straight line''' was introduced by ancient mathematicians to represent straight objects (i.e., having no [[curvature]]) with negligible width and depth. Lines are an idealization of such objects. Until the 17th century, lines were defined in this manner: "The [straight or curved] line is the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width. […] The straight line is that which is equally extended between its points."&lt;ref&gt;In (rather old) French: "La ligne est la première espece de quantité, laquelle a tant seulement une dimension à sçavoir longitude, sans aucune latitude ni profondité, &amp; n'est autre chose que le flux ou coulement du poinct, lequel […] laissera de son mouvement imaginaire quelque vestige en long, exempt de toute latitude. […] La ligne droicte est celle qui est également estenduë entre ses poincts." Pages 7 and 8 of ''Les quinze livres des éléments géométriques d'Euclide Megarien, traduits de Grec en François, &amp; augmentez de plusieurs figures &amp; demonstrations, avec la corrections des erreurs commises és autres traductions'', by Pierre Mardele, Lyon, MDCXLV (1645).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euclid]] described a line as "breadthless length" which "lies equally with respect to the points on itself"; he introduced several [[postulate]]s as basic unprovable properties from which he constructed all of geometry, which is now called [[Euclidean geometry]] to avoid confusion with other geometries which have been introduced since the end of the 19th century (such as [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], [[Projective geometry|projective]] and [[affine geometry]]).

In modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described. For instance, in [[analytic geometry]], a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given [[linear equation]], but in a more abstract setting, such as [[incidence geometry]], a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it.

When a geometry is described by a set of [[axiom]]s, the notion of a line is usually left undefined (a so-called [[primitive notion|primitive]] object). The properties of lines are then determined by the axioms which refer to them. One advantage to this approach is the flexibility it gives to users of the geometry.  Thus in [[differential geometry]] a line may be interpreted as a [[geodesic]] (shortest path between points), while in some [[Projective geometry|projective geometries]] a line is a 2-dimensional vector space (all linear combinations of two independent vectors). This flexibility also extends beyond mathematics and, for example, permits physicists to think of the path of a light ray as being a line.

==Definitions versus descriptions==
All definitions are ultimately [[Circular definition|circular]] in nature since they depend on concepts which must themselves have definitions, a dependence which cannot be continued indefinitely without returning to the starting point. To avoid this vicious circle certain concepts must be taken as [[primitive notion|primitive]] concepts; terms which are given no definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|loc=pg. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In geometry, it is frequently the case that the concept of line is taken as a primitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faber|1983|loc=pg. 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those situations where a line is a defined concept, as in [[coordinate geometry]], some other fundamental ideas are taken as primitives. When the line concept is a primitive, the behaviour and properties of lines are dictated by the [[axiom]]s which they must satisfy.

In a non-axiomatic or simplified axiomatic treatment of geometry, the concept of a primitive notion may be too abstract to be dealt with. In this circumstance it is possible that a ''description'' or ''mental image'' of a primitive notion is provided to give a foundation to build the notion on which would formally be based on the (unstated) axioms. Descriptions of this type may be referred to, by some authors, as definitions in this informal style of presentation. These are not true definitions and could not be used in formal proofs of statements. The "definition" of line in [[Euclid's Elements]] falls into this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faber|1983|loc=pg. 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the case where a specific geometry is being considered (for example, [[Euclidean geometry]]), there is no generally accepted agreement among authors as to what an informal description of a line should be when the subject is not being treated formally.

==In Euclidean geometry==
{{see also|Euclidean geometry}}
When geometry was first formalised by [[Euclid]] in the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', he defined a general line (straight or curved) to be "breadthless length" with a straight line being a line "which lies evenly with the points on itself".&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Appendix A, p.&amp;nbsp;291.&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions serve little purpose since they use terms which are not, themselves, defined. In fact, Euclid did not use these definitions in this work and probably included them just to make it clear to the reader what was being discussed. In modern geometry, a line is simply taken as an undefined object with properties given by [[axiom]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Part III, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; but is sometimes defined as a set of points obeying a linear relationship when some other fundamental concept is left undefined.

In an [[axiom]]atic formulation of Euclidean geometry, such as that of [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert]] (Euclid's original axioms contained various flaws which have been corrected by modern mathematicians),&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Part III, p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt; a line is stated to have certain properties which relate it to other lines and [[point (geometry)|points]]. For example, for any two distinct points, there is a unique line containing them, and any two distinct lines intersect in at most one point.&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Appendix B, p.&amp;nbsp;300.&lt;/ref&gt; In two [[dimension]]s, i.e., the Euclidean [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], two lines which do not intersect are called [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]]. In higher dimensions, two lines that do not intersect are parallel if they are contained in a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], or [[Skew lines|skew]] if they are not.

Any collection of finitely many lines partitions the plane into [[convex polygon]]s (possibly unbounded); this partition is known as an [[arrangement of lines]].

===On the Cartesian plane===

Lines in a [[Cartesian plane]] or, more generally, in [[affine coordinates]], can be described algebraically by [[linear equation]]s. 

In [[Two-dimensional space|two dimensions]], the equation for non-vertical lines is often given in the ''[[slope-intercept form]]'':
:&lt;math&gt; y = mx + b &lt;/math&gt;
where:
: ''m'' is the [[slope]] or [[slope|gradient]] of the line.
: ''b'' is the [[y-intercept]] of the line.
: ''x'' is the [[independent variable]] of the function ''y'' = ''f''(''x'').

The slope of the line through points &lt;math&gt;A(x_a, y_a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(x_b, y_b)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;x_a \neq x_b&lt;/math&gt;, is given by &lt;math&gt;m = (y_b - y_a)/(x_b - x_a)&lt;/math&gt; and the equation of this line can be written &lt;math&gt;y = m (x - x_a) + y_a&lt;/math&gt;.

In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R^2}&lt;/math&gt;, every line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (including vertical lines) is described by a linear equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;L=\{(x,y)\mid ax+by=c\} &lt;/math&gt;

with fixed real [[coefficient]]s ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' such that ''a'' and ''b'' are not both zero. Using this form, vertical lines correspond to the equations with ''b'' = 0.

There are many variant ways to write the equation of a line which can all be converted from one to another by algebraic manipulation. These forms (see [[Linear equation]] for other forms) are generally named by the type of information (data) about the line that is needed to write down the form. Some of the important data of a line is its slope, [[root of a function|x-intercept]], known points on the line and y-intercept.

The equation of the line passing through two different points &lt;math&gt;P_0( x_0, y_0 )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_1(x_1, y_1)&lt;/math&gt; may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;(y - y_0)(x_1 - x_0) = (y_1 - y_0)(x - x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.
If ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', this equation may be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;y=(x-x_0)\,\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}+y_0&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;y=x\,\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}+\frac{x_1y_0-x_0y_1}{x_1-x_0}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]], lines can ''not'' be described by a single linear equation, so they are frequently described by [[parametric equation]]s:
:&lt;math&gt; x = x_0 + at &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = y_0 + bt &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; z = z_0 + ct &lt;/math&gt;
where:
: ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are all functions of the independent variable ''t'' which ranges over the real numbers.
: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is any point on the line.
: ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are related to the slope of the line, such that the [[vector (geometric)|vector]] (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') is parallel to the line.

They may also be described as the simultaneous solutions of two [[linear equation]]s
:&lt;math&gt; a_1x+b_1y+c_1z-d_1=0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a_2x+b_2y+c_2z-d_2=0 &lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt; (a_1,b_1,c_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (a_2,b_2,c_2)&lt;/math&gt; are not proportional (the relations &lt;math&gt; a_1=ta_2, b_1=tb_2, c_1=tc_2 &lt;/math&gt; imply &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;). This follows since in three dimensions a single linear equation typically describes a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] and a line is what is common to two distinct intersecting planes.

====In normal form====
{{main|Hesse normal form}}
The ''normal form'' (also called the ''Hesse normal form'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Plane Analytic Geometry: With Introductory Chapters on the Differential Calculus|first=Maxime|last=Bôcher|publisher=H. Holt|year=1915|authorlink=Maxime Bôcher|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYkLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA44|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513124511/https://books.google.com/books?id=bYkLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA44|archivedate=2016-05-13|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; after the German mathematician [[Otto Hesse|Ludwig Otto Hesse]]), is based on the ''[[normal (geometry)|normal]] segment'' for a given line, which is defined to be the line segment drawn from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] perpendicular to the line. This segment joins the origin with the closest point on the line to the origin.  The normal form of the equation of a straight line on the plane is given by:
:: &lt;math&gt; y \sin \theta + x \cos \theta - p = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''θ'' is the angle of inclination of the normal segment (the oriented angle from the unit vector of the ''x'' axis to this segment), and ''p'' is the (positive) length of the normal segment. The normal form can be derived from the general form &lt;math&gt;ax+by=c&lt;/math&gt; by dividing all of the coefficients by

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{|c|}\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the slope-intercept and intercept forms, this form can represent any line but also requires only two finite parameters, ''θ'' and ''p'', to be specified. If ''p'' &gt; 0, then ''θ'' is uniquely defined modulo 2{{pi}}. On the other hand, if the line is through the origin (''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0), one drops the {{math|''c''/{{!}}''c''{{!}}}} term to compute sin''θ'' and cos''θ'', and ''θ'' is only defined modulo {{pi}}.

===In polar coordinates===
In [[polar coordinates]] on the Euclidean plane the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is expressed as:
::&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{mr\cos\theta+b}{\sin\theta},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the slope of the line and b is the ''y''-intercept.  When ''θ'' = 0 the graph will be undefined. The equation can be rewritten to eliminate discontinuities in this manner:
::&lt;math&gt;r\sin\theta=mr\cos\theta+b.&lt;/math&gt;
In polar coordinates on the Euclidean plane, the intercept form of the equation of a line that is non-horizontal, non-vertical, and does not pass through pole may be expressed as,
::&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{1}{\frac{\cos\theta}{x_o}+\frac{\sin\theta}{y_o}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_o&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_o&lt;/math&gt; represent the ''x'' and ''y'' intercepts respectively.
The above equation is not applicable for vertical and horizontal lines because in these cases one of the intercepts does not exist. Moreover, it is not applicable on lines passing through the pole since in this case, both ''x'' and ''y'' intercepts are zero (which is not allowed here since &lt;math&gt;x_o&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_o&lt;/math&gt; are denominators).
A vertical line that doesn't pass through the pole is given by the equation
::&lt;math&gt;r\cos\theta=x_o.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, a horizontal line that doesn't pass through the pole is given by the equation
::&lt;math&gt;r\sin\theta=y_o.&lt;/math&gt;
The equation of a line which passes through the pole is simply given as:
::&lt;math&gt;\tan\theta=m&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the slope of the line.

===As a vector equation===
The vector equation of the line through points A and B is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{OA} + \lambda\, \mathbf{AB}&lt;/math&gt; (where λ is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]).

If '''a''' is vector '''OA''' and '''b''' is vector '''OB''', then the equation of the line can be written: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{a} + \lambda (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})&lt;/math&gt;.

A ray starting at point ''A'' is described by limiting λ. One ray is obtained if λ ≥ 0, and the opposite ray comes from λ ≤ 0.

===In Euclidean space===

In [[three-dimensional space]], a [[first degree equation]] in the variables ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' defines a plane, so two such equations, provided the planes they give rise to are not parallel, define a line which is the intersection of the planes. More generally, in ''n''-dimensional space ''n''-1 first-degree equations in the ''n'' [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinate]] variables define a line under suitable conditions.

In more general [[Euclidean space]], '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (and analogously in every other [[affine space]]), the line ''L'' passing through two different points ''a'' and ''b'' (considered as vectors) is the subset
:&lt;math&gt;L = \{(1-t)\,a+t\,b\mid t\in\mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt;
The direction of the line is from ''a'' (''t'' = 0) to ''b'' (''t'' = 1), or in other words, in the direction of the vector ''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''. Different choices of ''a'' and ''b'' can yield the same line.

====Collinear points====
{{Main|Collinearity}}
Three points are said to be ''collinear'' if they lie on the same line. Three points ''[[general position|usually]]'' determine a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], but in the case of three collinear points this does ''not'' happen.

In [[affine coordinates]], in ''n''-dimensional space the points ''X''=(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), ''Y''=(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), and ''Z''=(''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are collinear if the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; \dots &amp; x_n  \\
 1 &amp; y_1 &amp; y_2 &amp; \dots &amp; y_n \\
 1 &amp; z_1 &amp; z_2 &amp; \dots &amp; z_n
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
has a [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] less than 3. In particular, for three points in the plane (''n'' = 2), the above matrix is square and the points are collinear if and only if its [[determinant]] is zero.

Equivalently for three points in a plane, the points are collinear if and only if the slope between one pair of points equals the slope between any other pair of points (in which case the slope between the remaining pair of points will equal the other slopes). By extension, ''k'' points in a plane are collinear if and only if  any (''k''–1) pairs of points have the same pairwise slopes.

In [[Euclidean geometry]], the [[Euclidean distance]] ''d''(''a'',''b'') between two points ''a'' and ''b'' may be used to express the collinearity between three points by:&lt;ref&gt;[[Alessandro Padoa]], Un nouveau système de définitions pour la géométrie euclidienne, [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], 1900&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]], [[The Principles of Mathematics]], p.410&lt;/ref&gt;
:The points ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are collinear if and only if ''d''(''x'',''a'') = ''d''(''c'',''a'') and ''d''(''x'',''b'') = ''d''(''c'',''b'') implies ''x''=''c''.
However, there are other notions of distance (such as the [[Manhattan distance]]) for which this property is not true.

In the geometries where the concept of a line is a [[primitive notion]], as may be the case in some [[synthetic geometry|synthetic geometries]], other methods of determining collinearity are needed.

=== Types of lines ===
In a sense,&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the [[collineation group]] acts [[transitive action|transitively]] on the set of lines.&lt;/ref&gt; all lines in Euclidean geometry are equal, in that, without coordinates, one can not tell them apart from one another. However, lines may play special roles with respect to other objects in the geometry and be divided into types according to that relationship. For instance, with respect to a [[Conic section|conic]] (a [[circle]], [[ellipse]], [[parabola]], or [[hyperbola]]), lines can be:
* [[tangent line]]s, which touch the conic at a single point;
* [[secant line]]s, which intersect the conic at two points and pass through its interior;
* exterior lines, which do not meet the conic at any point of the Euclidean plane; or
*a  [[Directrix of a conic section|directrix]], whose distance from a point helps to establish whether the point is on the conic.

In the context of determining [[parallel (geometry)|parallelism]] in Euclidean geometry, a [[transversal (geometry)|transversal]] is a line that intersects two other lines that may or not be parallel to each other.

For more general [[algebraic curve]]s, lines could also be:
* ''i''-secant lines, meeting the curve in ''i'' points counted without multiplicity, or
* [[asymptote]]s, which a curve approaches arbitrarily closely without touching it.
With respect to [[Euclidean triangle|triangle]]s we have:
* the [[Euler line]],
* the [[Simson line]]s, and
* [[central line (geometry)|central lines]].

For a [[convex polygon|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] with at most two parallel sides, the [[Newton line]] is the line that connects the midpoints of the two [[diagonal]]s.

For a [[hexagon]] with vertices lying on a conic we have the [[Pascal line]] and, in the special case where the conic is a pair of lines, we have the [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|Pappus line]].

[[Parallel (geometry)|Parallel lines]] are lines in the same plane that never cross. [[Line-line intersection|Intersecting lines]] share a single point in common. Coincidental lines coincide with each other&amp;mdash;every point that is on either one of them is also on the other.

[[Perpendicular lines]] are lines that intersect at [[right angle]]s.

In [[three-dimensional space]], [[skew lines]] are lines that are not in the same plane and thus do not intersect each other.

==In projective geometry==
{{further|Projective geometry}}
In many models of [[projective geometry]], the representation of a line rarely conforms to the notion of the "straight curve" as it is visualised in Euclidean geometry.  In [[elliptic geometry]] we see a typical example of this.&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Part III, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spherical representation of elliptic geometry, lines are represented by [[great circle]]s of a sphere with diametrically opposite points identified. In a different model of elliptic geometry, lines are represented by Euclidean [[plane (geometry)|planes]] passing through the origin. Even though these representations are visually distinct, they satisfy all the properties (such as, two points determining a unique line) that make them suitable representations for lines in this geometry.

==Extensions==

=== Ray ===&lt;!-- This section is linked (older copy) from: [[Tangent]], [[Ray (mathematics)]],  --&gt;
Given a line and any point ''A'' on it, we may consider ''A'' as decomposing this line into two parts.
Each such part is called a '''ray''' (or '''half-line''') and the point ''A'' is called its ''initial point''. The point A is considered to be a member of the ray.&lt;ref&gt;On occasion we may consider a ray without its initial point. Such rays are called ''open'' rays, in contrast to the typical ray which would be said to be ''closed''.&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, a ray consists of those points on a line passing through ''A'' and proceeding indefinitely, starting at ''A'', in one direction only along the line.  However, in order to use this concept of a ray in proofs a more precise definition is required.

Given distinct points ''A'' and ''B'', they determine a unique ray with initial point ''A''.  As two points define a unique line, this ray consists of all the points between ''A'' and ''B'' (including ''A'' and ''B'') and all the points ''C'' on the line through ''A'' and ''B'' such that ''B'' is between ''A'' and ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wylie, Jr.|1964|loc=pg. 59, Definition 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is, at times, also expressed as the set of all points ''C'' such that ''A'' is not between ''B'' and ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedoe|1988|loc=pg. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A point ''D'', on the line determined by ''A'' and ''B'' but not in the ray with initial point ''A'' determined by ''B'', will determine another ray with initial point ''A''. With respect to the ''AB'' ray, the ''AD'' ray is called the ''opposite ray''.
[[File:Ray (A, B, C).svg|500px|center|Ray]]

Thus, we would say that two different points, ''A'' and ''B'', define a line and a decomposition of this line into the [[disjoint union]] of an open segment {{open-open|''A'', ''B''}} and two rays, ''BC'' and ''AD'' (the point ''D'' is not drawn in the diagram, but is to the left of ''A'' on the line ''AB''). These are not opposite rays since they have different initial points.

In Euclidean geometry two rays with a common endpoint form an [[angle]].

The definition of a ray depends upon the notion of betweenness for points on a line. It follows that rays exist only for geometries for which this notion exists, typically [[Euclidean geometry]] or [[affine geometry]] over an [[ordered field]]. On the other hand, rays do not exist in [[projective geometry]] nor in a geometry over a non-ordered field, like the [[complex number]]s or any [[finite field]].

In [[topology]], a ray in a space ''X'' is a continuous embedding '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → ''X''. It is used to define the important concept of [[end (topology)|end]] of the space.

===Line segment===
{{main|Line segment}}

A [[line segment]] is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points and contains every point on the line between its end points.  Depending on how the line segment is defined, either of the two end points may or may not be part of the line segment.  Two or more line segments may have some of the same relationships as lines, such as being parallel, intersecting, or skew, but unlike lines they may be none of these, if they are [[coplanar]] and either do not intersect or are [[collinearity|collinear]].

===Geodesics===
{{main|Geodesics}}

The "shortness" and "straightness" of a line, interpreted as the property that the [[distance]] along the line between any two of its points is minimized (see [[triangle inequality]]), can be generalized and leads to the concept of [[geodesic]]s in [[metric space]]s.

[[File:Hohenfriedeberg - Attack of Prussian Infantry - 1745.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Prussia]]n line infantry attack at the 1745 [[Battle of Hohenfriedberg]].]]

'''Line infantry''' was the type of [[infantry]] that composed the basis of European land armies from the middle of the 17th century to the middle of the 19th century. For both battle and parade drill, it consisted of two to four ranks of foot soldiers drawn up side by side in rigid alignment, and thereby maximizing the effect of their firepower. By extension, the term came to be applied to the regular regiments "of the line" as opposed to [[Foot Guards]], [[light infantry]], [[skirmisher]]s, [[militia]], [[Combat service support|support]] personnel, plus some other special categories of infantry not focused on heavy [[front line]] combat.&lt;ref&gt;''The Concise Oxford Dictionary'', 1984, {{ISBN|0-19-861131-5}}. p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linear tactics and function ==
Line infantry mainly used three formations in its battles: the line, the square and the column.

With the massive proliferation of [[small arms]] (firearms that could be carried by hand, as opposed to cannon) in the infantry units from the middle of 17th century, the battlefield was dominated by [[Line (formation)|linear tactics]], according to which the infantry was aligned into long thin lines and fired volleys. A line consisted of 2, 3 or 4 ranks of soldiers.

According to the instructions, the soldiers were supposed to fire at volleys at the command of officers. But in a real battle, this happened only in the first minutes of the battle. After one or two volleys, each soldier charged a musket and fired at his own discretion, without hearing the commands of the officers. Which of course brought confusion to the system, and the smoke interfered with the accurate shooting. Such a shootout in a puff of smoke could occur for a very long period of time and inflicted huge losses on both sides, and the result was unpredictable. In addition, at the time of the “hot” shootout, the soldiers were so busy and focused on shooting that they could not notice the attack of cavalry from the flank. Therefore, experienced officers tried to avoid such costly shootouts and restrained their soldiers from premature firing, in order to get closer to the enemy’s line as close as possible and solve the battle with several crushing volleys at a short distance. In some cases, it was possible to overturn the enemy with just one volley at a short distance. 
The line was considered as the fundamental battle formation as it allowed for the largest deployment of firepower. Troops in [[skirmish]] formation, though able to take cover and use initiative, were highly vulnerable to cavalry and could not hold ground against advancing infantry columns. Line infantry provided an 'anchor' for skirmishers and cavalry to retreat to if threatened.

Against surrounding enemy cavalry, line infantry could swiftly adopt [[Infantry square|square formation]]s to provide protection. Such squares were hollow (consisting of four lines), unlike the pikemen' and old-style musketeers' square.

Movement in [[Line (formation)|line formation]] was very slow, and unless the battalion was superbly trained, a breakdown in cohesion was virtually assured, especially in any kind of uneven or wooded terrain. As a result, line was mostly used as a stationary formation, with troops moving in [[Column (formation)|column formation]]s and then deploying to line at their destination. Usually, columns would be adopted for movement and melee attacks.

Line infantry was trained in the [[manual of arms]] evolutions, the main objectives of which were fast deployment of a line, rapid shooting and manoeuvre.

== Training and recruitment ==
Line tactics required a strict discipline and simple movements, practiced to the point where they became second-nature. During training, the drill and corporal punishments were widely used.

Line infantry quickly became the most common type of infantry in European countries. [[Musketeer]]s and [[grenadier]]s, formerly [[Special forces#History|elite troops]], gradually became part of the line infantry, switching to linear tactics.

Over time the use of line infantry tactics spread outside of Europe, often as a result of European imperialism. In European colonies and settlements with small populations from the home country, line infantry forces were often raised from the local population, with the British [[East India Company]]'s [[sepoys]] perhaps being the most historically significant example.

During 1814, [[the War of the Six Coalition]], regular French line infantry recruits were trained very infirmitively due to the fierce attack of the Coalition Forces. A recruit was trained by firing two cartridges and four blanks. There was also light training of forming several formations. By these examples, forming a massive extent of well trained, elite line infantry was a very complicated process.

== Arms and equipment ==
In the middle of the 16th century, the [[matchlock]] muskets of some line infantry were equipped with [[bayonet]]s. Bayonets were attached to the muzzles of muskets and were used when line troops entered [[melee]] combat. They also helped to defend against cavalry.

At the end of the 17th century, a flaw within the design of [[matchlock]] muskets became more apparent. Since the matchlock musket used a slow burning piece of twine know as a [[slow match]], the twine sometimes would accidentally set fire to the gunpowder reservoir in the musket prematurely setting off all of the gunpowder and bringing serious injury and death to the operator. During this time, matchlock muskets began to be replaced by lighter and cheaper infantry [[fusilier|fusils]] with [[flintlock]]s, weighing 5&amp;nbsp;kg with a caliber of 17.5&amp;nbsp;mm, first in France and then in other countries. In many countries, the new fusils retained the name "musket". Both muskets and fusils were [[smoothbore]], which lessened their accuracy and range, but made for faster loading, lesser amount of bore fouling and more robust, less complicated firearms.

The range and accuracy of smooth-bore muskets was in the range of 300-400 yards against the line of infantry / cavalry. In a single enemy could get from a distance of no more than 50-100 yards. It should be borne in mind that ordinary linear infantrymen were poorly trained in aimed shooting, due to the saving of gunpowder and lead (modern reenactors achieve much better results by firing smooth-bore muskets). But the line infantrymen were well trained in fast reloading muskets. The recruit should have done at least 3 rounds a minute, and an experienced soldier could have done up to 6 rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2563593-firepower&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.books-share.com/ebook/napoleonic-infantry-napoleonic-weapons-and-warfare&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of the line infantry had no protective equipment, as armor that could provide protection from musket fire were considered too expensive and heavy. Only the former elite troops could keep by tradition some elements of protection, for example, the copper mitre caps of grenadiers.

== Line infantry and other contemporary types of infantry ==
Initially, soldiers equipped with firearms formed only a small part of the infantry branch of most armies, because of their vulnerability to hostile cavalry. [[Pikemen]] formed the majority of infantrymen and were known as heavy infantry. A significant part of infantry consisted of old-style musketeers, who did not use the linear tactics, instead skirmishing in open formation. However, by the middle of the 17th century, musketeers deployed in line formation already provided about half of the foot troops in most Western European armies. [[Maurice of Nassau]] was noted as the first large scale user of linear tactic, introducing the 'counter-march' to enable his formations of musketeers to maintain a continuous fire. After the invention of the bayonet, musketeers could finally defend themselves from the enemy's horsemen, and the percentage of pikemen fell gradually. In 1699, the Austrian army got rid of their pikes. In 1703, the French army did the same, in 1704 the British and 1708 the Dutch. In 1699–1721, [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] converted almost all Russian foot-regiments to line infantry. The abandonment of the pike, together with the faster firing rate made possible by the introduction of the new [[flintlock]] [[musket]] and [[paper cartridge]], resulted in the abandonment of the deeper formations of troops more ideal for the melee-oriented pikemen. Instead, military thinking switched to shallower lines that maximized the firepower of an infantry formation.

Besides regular line infantry, there were elite troops (royal guards and other designated elite regiments) and the [[Light infantry#Modern age|light infantry]]. Light infantry operated in extended order (also known as skirmish formation) as opposed to the close order (tight formations) used by line infantry. Since the late 18th century, light infantry in most European countries mostly consisted of [[Rifleman|riflemen]] (such as the German [[Jäger (military)|Jäger]]), armed with rifled carbines and trained in aimed shooting and use of [[Enfilade and defilade|defilades]]. In England, much of the light infantry was armed with smooth-bore muskets, only a few regiments used rifled muskets. &lt;ref&gt;https://allslide.net/embed/philip-haythornthwaite-napoleonic-infantry-napo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kobo.com/fi/en/ebook/british-light-infantry-rifle-tactics-of-the-napoleonic-wars&lt;/ref&gt; In the Russian Empire, light infantry was forming at a very fast pace; by the end of the 18th century, light infantry regiments numbered 40,000 soldiers (jaeger). In the Russian army, light infantry weapons were significantly different from line infantry. Light infantrymen were armed with short, high-quality manufacturing muskets. In addition, each light infantryman was armed with a pistol with a flintlock.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.wikireading.ru/83385&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://adjudant.ru/regulations/1786-eger-03.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Line infantry, whose muskets with bayonets were heavier than carbines, became known as heavy infantry and were used as the main deciding force.

In France, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], the division into the Guard, while line infantry and light infantry formally continued to exist, line and "light" [[regiment]]s had identical weaponry (smooth-bore fusils) and tactics. (Napoleon preferred smooth-bore weaponry for their faster reload speeds.) However, each battalion in both line and "light" regiments included a company of [[voltigeurs]], who were expected to act as skirmishers as well being able to deploy into line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://napoleonistyka.atspace.com/French_infantry.html#_grenadiers_fusiliers_carabiniers_chasseurs_voltigeurs |title=Napoleon, His Army and Enemies. |last1=var. contributors |website=napoleonistyka.atspace.com |publisher=Zbynio Olszewski (webmaster)|access-date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the unsuccessful army reforms of Paul I, the number of light infantry in the Russian army was significantly reduced and made up only 8% of the entire field infantry. But soon the Russian army returned to the trend of increasing the number of light infantry, begun in the 18th century. By 1811, 50 light infantry regiments were formed in the Russian army. In addition, in each linear battalion it was required to have 100 of the best shooting soldiers who fought in a loose ranks and covered their battalions from the enemy skirmishers. The total number of light infantry reached 40% of the entire field infantry. Unfortunately, the sharp increase in the number of light infantry greatly influenced their quality of training and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%95%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/Drill/Russ_skirmish_Drill_1818.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian infantry of 1854 comprised 108 regiments, of which 42 were line infantry. The remainder were specialized or elite units such as Guards, Grenadiers and Jägers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert H.G.|last=Thomas|page=4|title=The Russian Army of the Crimean War 1854-56|ISBN=1-85532-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only part of the Russian light infantry were equipped with the M1854 rifle, the remainder retaining smoothbore percussion muskets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert H.G.|last=Thomas|pages=16–17|title=The Russian Army of the Crimean War 1854-56|ISBN=1-85532-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 19th century, the coming of [[mass production]] and new technologies, such as the [[Minie ball]], allowed European armies to gradually equip all their infantrymen with [[rifled]] weapons, and the percentage of line infantry equipped with muskets fell. In the American Civil War, both Northern and Confederate armies had only a few [[line regiment]]s equipped with the old-style smooth-bore muskets. However, France, due to Napoleon III, who admired Napoleon I, had 300 line battalions (comprising an overwhelming majority) even in 1870. Although the French line infantry received Chassepot rifles in 1866, it was still being trained in the use of close formations (line, column and square), which was changed only after the dethronement of Napoleon III. This was common practice in all conventional Western armies until the late 19th century, as infantry tactics and military thinking had yet to catch up with the new technological development.

== Battlefield obsolescence ==
In the years after the Napoleonic Wars, line infantry continued to be deployed as the main battle force, while light infantry provided fire support and covered the movement of units. In Russia, Great Britain, France, Prussia and some other states, linear tactics and formation discipline were maintained into the late 19th century.

With the invention of new weaponry, the concept of line infantry began to wane. The [[Minié ball]] (an improved rifle ammunition), allowed individual infantrymen to shoot more accurately and over greatly increased range. Men walking in formation line-abreast became easy targets, as evidenced in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Thomas and David Kennedy: ''The American Pageant'', p. 434. 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866 showed that [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading rifles]], which gave the individual shooter a greatly increased rate of fire, were greatly superior to muzzleloaded rifles. In the 1860s, most German states and Russia converted their line infantry and riflemen into 'united' infantry, which used rifles and skirmish tactics. After the Franco-Prussian War, both the [[German Empire]] and the [[French Third Republic]] did the same. However, Great Britain retained the name "line infantry", although it used rifled muskets from 1853, breech loading rifles from 1867, and switched from closed lines to extended order during Boer wars.

The growing accuracy and rate of fire of rifles, together with the invention of the [[Maxim gun|Maxim]] machine gun in 1883, meant that close order line infantry would suffer huge losses before being able to close with their foe, while the defensive advantages given to line infantry against cavalry became irrelevant with the effective removal of offensive [[cavalry]] from the battlefield in the face of the improved weaponry. With the turn of the 20th Century, this slowly led to infantry increasingly adopting [[skirmish]] style [[light infantry]] tactics in battle, while retaining line infantry drill for training.

== Retention of "line infantry" title ==
While, as detailed above, linear battle tactics had become obsolete by the second half of the nineteenth century, regiments in a number of European armies continued to be classified as "line infantry" (or cavalry). This designation had come to mean the regular or numbered regiments of an army, as opposed to specialist or elite formations. Accordingly, the distinction had become one of traditional title or classification without significance in respect of armament or tactics. As an example, the 
[[Belgian Army order of battle (1914)|Belgian Army of 1914]] comprised 14 regiments of ''Infanterie de Ligne'' (line infantry), three of ''Chasseurs a pied'' (light infantry), one of ''Grenadiers'' and one of ''Carabiniers''.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Derie, ''Les Soldats de Leopold Ier et Leopold II'', D 1986/0197/03, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Pawly &amp; P. Lierneux, ''The Belgian Army in World War I'', {{ISBN|978-1-84603-448-0}}.  p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar differentiations were made in the majority of European armies of the period, although English-speaking authors sometimes use the designation "line infantry" when referring to the ordinary infantry of some other countries where the exact term was not in use.

The term was also used by US units during the Second World War, as shown by this quote from a report of the [[782nd Tank Battalion]] in late April 1945:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the 22nd of April, the Battalion moved from Oberkotzau, Germany to [[Wunsiedel]], Germany. Here the attachment of the line companies to the Regimental Combat Teams of the [[97th Infantry Division (United States)|97th Division]] was completed. We separated, not coming together again until the war was over. Company "A" joined the 303rd at Rehau, Germany: Company "B" joined the 386th at Arzburg, Germany: and Company "C" the 387th at Waldsassen, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;United States Army, "[http://digicom.bpl.lib.me.us/ww_reg_his/9 782nd Tank Batallion]" (1945). World War Regimental Histories. 9. pp. 17, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The modern [[British Army]] retains the traditional distinction between "Guards", "Line Infantry" and "the Rifles" on ceremonial occasions for historical reasons. It is linked to the [[British Army order of precedence|order of precedence]] within the British Army and regimental pride, so for example Colonel Patrick Crowley states in the "introduction" in ''A Brief History of The [[Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment]]'' (2015):

{{quote|The examples of valour, adherence to duty, and fortitude, continue to inspire the current officers and soldiers of the modern Regiment, who are proud to belong to the most senior English Regiment of the Line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Colonel Patrick  |date=2015 |url=http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/pwrrguide2015.pdf |chapter=Introduction |title=A Brief History of The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment |publisher=army.mod.uk |page=2 (PDF 4) |access-date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Infantry of most 21st-century armies are still trained in formation manoeuvre and [[Military parade|drill]], as a way of instilling [[discipline]] and [[unit cohesion]]. Members of the US Army utilize the term "line company" (informally) in light infantry battalions to differentiate those companies (generally A–D) that perform the traditional infantry role from the support companies (generally F and HHC) charged with supporting the "line companies". The Marine Corps does the same for all its infantry units. In this vein, officers assigned to the rifle companies are referred to as "line officers" while billeted to positions such as Platoon Leaders and Commanding and Executive Officers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1997">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], collections of subsets are said to be locally discrete if they look like they have precisely one element from a local point of view. The study of locally discrete collections is worthwhile as [[Bing's metrization theorem]] shows.

==Formal definition==

Let ''X'' be a [[topological space]]. A collection {G&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;} of subsets of ''X'' is said to be locally discrete, if each point of the space has a [[neighbourhood]] intersecting at most one element of the collection. A collection of subsets of ''X'' is said to be countably locally discrete, if it is the countable union of locally discrete collections.

==Properties and examples==

1. Locally discrete collections are always [[Locally finite collection|locally finite]]. See the page on local finiteness.

2. If a collection of subsets of a topological space X is locally discrete, it must satisfy the property that each point of the space belongs to at most one element of the collection. This means that only collections of pairwise disjoint sets can be locally discrete. 

3. A [[Hausdorff space]] cannot have a locally discrete basis unless it is itself discrete. The same property holds for a [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]].

4. The following is known as Bing's metrization theorem:

A space ''X'' is metrizable iff it is regular and has a basis that is countably locally discrete.

5. A [[countable set|countable]] collection of sets is necessarily countably locally discrete. Therefore, if X is a metrizable space with a [[Second countable|countable basis]], one implication of Bing's metrization theorem holds. In fact, Bing's metrization theorem is almost a corollary of the [[Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem|Nagata-Smirnov theorem]].

In economics, '''marginal cost''' is the change in the [[opportunity cost]] that arises when the quantity produced is incremented by one unit, that is, it is the [[cost]] of producing one more unit of a good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = O'Sullivan| first = Arthur| authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)| first2 = Steven M. | last2 = Sheffrin| title = Economics: Principles in Action| publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall| year = 2003| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458| page = 111| isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, marginal cost at each level of production includes the cost of any additional inputs required to produce the next unit. At each level of production and time period being considered, marginal costs include all costs that vary with the level of production, whereas other costs that do not vary with production are considered [[fixed cost|fixed]]. For example, the marginal cost of producing an automobile will generally include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile and not the [[fixed cost]]s of the factory that have already been incurred. In practice, marginal analysis is segregated into short and long-run cases, so that, over the long run, all costs (including fixed costs) become marginal.

If the [[cost curve|cost function]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], the marginal cost &lt;math&gt;MC&lt;/math&gt; is the first derivative of the cost function with respect to the quantity &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Carl|last2=Blume|first2=Lawrence|title=Mathematics for Economists|date=1994|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=0393957330}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MC(Q) = \frac{\ dC}{\ dQ}&lt;/math&gt;
The marginal cost can be a function of quantity if the cost function is non-linear.  If the cost function is not differentiable, the marginal cost can be expressed as follows.
:&lt;math&gt; MC = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Q}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; denotes an incremental change of one unit.

==Cost functions and relationship to average cost==
In the simplest case, the total cost function and its [[derivative]] are expressed as follows, where Q represents the production quantity, VC represents variable costs, FC represents [[fixed cost]]s and TC represents total costs.

Since (by definition) fixed costs do not vary with production quantity, it drops out of the equation when it is differentiated.  The important conclusion is that marginal cost ''is not related to'' fixed costs. This can be compared with [[average total cost]] or ATC, which is the total cost divided by the number of units produced and ''does'' include fixed costs.

:&lt;math&gt;ATC=\frac{C_0 + \Delta C}{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

For discrete calculation without calculus, marginal cost equals the change in total (or variable) cost that comes with each additional unit produced. In contrast, '''incremental cost''' is the composition of total cost from the surrogate of contributions, where any increment is determined by the contribution of the cost factors, not necessarily by single units.

For instance, suppose the total cost of making 1 shoe is $30 and the total cost of making 2 shoes is $40. The marginal cost of producing the second shoe is $40 – $30 = $10.

Marginal cost is not the cost of producing the "next" or "last" unit.&lt;ref&gt;Silberberg &amp; Suen, The Structure of Economics, A Mathematical Analysis 3rd ed. (McGraw-Hill 2001) at 181.&lt;/ref&gt; As Silberberg and Suen note, the cost of the last unit is the same as the cost of the first unit and every other unit. In the short run, increasing production requires using more of the variable input &amp;mdash; conventionally assumed to be labor. Adding more labor to a fixed capital stock reduces the marginal product of labor because of the [[diminishing returns|diminishing marginal returns]]. This reduction in productivity is not limited to the additional labor needed to produce the marginal unit – the productivity of every unit of labor is reduced. Thus the costs of producing the marginal unit of output has two components:
the cost associated with producing the marginal unit
and the increase in average costs for all units produced due to the "damage" to the entire productive process (∂AC/∂q)q. 
The first component is the per unit or average cost. The second unit is the small increase in costs due to the law of diminishing marginal returns which increases the costs of all units of sold.

Marginal costs can also be expressed as the cost per unit of labor divided by the marginal product of labor.&lt;ref&gt;See http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-01-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2007/lecture-notes/14_01_lec13.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MC = \frac{\Delta VC}{\Delta Q}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta VC = {w \Delta L}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; MC = \frac{w \Delta L}{\Delta Q}&lt;/math&gt;
Because &lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta L}{\Delta Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the change in quantity of labor that affects a one unit change in output, this implies that this equals &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{MPL}&lt;/math&gt;.

where MPL is the ratio of increase in the quantity produced per unit increase in labour i.e. ΔQ/ΔL.
Therefore, &lt;math&gt; MC = \frac{w}{MPL}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Chia-Hui Chen, course materials for 14.01 Principles of Microeconomics, Fall 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [12 Sept 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; Since the wage rate is assumed constant, marginal cost and marginal product of labor have an inverse relationship&amp;mdash;if marginal cost is increasing  (decreasing) the marginal product of labor is decreasing (increasing).&lt;ref&gt;Note also that AVC = VC/Q=wL/Q = w/(Q/L) OR w/AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economies of scale==
Economies of scale applies to the long run, a span of time in which all inputs can be varied by the firm so that there are no fixed inputs or fixed costs.  Production may be subject to [[economies of scale]] (or [[diseconomies of scale]]). Economies of scale are said to exist if an additional unit of output can be produced for less than the average of all previous units&amp;mdash; that is, if long-run marginal cost is below long-run average cost, so the latter is falling.  Conversely, there may be levels of production where marginal cost is higher than average cost, and the average cost is an increasing function of output.  For this generic case, minimum average cost occurs at the point where average cost and marginal cost are equal (when plotted, the marginal cost curve intersects the average cost curve from below); this point will ''not'' be at the minimum for marginal cost if fixed costs are greater than 0.

==Perfectly competitive supply curve==

The portion of the marginal cost curve above its intersection with the average variable cost curve is the supply curve for a firm operating in a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]]. (the portion of the MC curve below its intersection with the AVC curve is not part of the supply curve because a firm would not operate at price below the shutdown point) This is not true for firms operating in other market structures. For example, while a monopoly "has" an MC curve it does not have a supply curve.  In a perfectly competitive market, a supply curve shows the quantity a seller's willing and able to supply at each price – for each price, there is a unique quantity that would be supplied. The one-to-one relationship simply is absent in the case of a monopoly. With a monopoly, there could be an infinite number of prices associated with a given quantity. It all depends on the shape and position of the demand curve and its accompanying marginal revenue curve.

==Decisions taken based on marginal costs==
In perfectly competitive markets, firms decide the quantity to be produced based on marginal costs and sale price. If the sale price is higher than the marginal cost, then they supply the unit and sell it. If the marginal cost is higher than the price, it would not be profitable to produce it. So the production will be carried out until the marginal cost is equal to the sale price. In other words, firms refuse to sell if the marginal cost is greater than the market price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economicswebinstitute.org/glossary/refusaltosell.htm "Piana V. (2011), Refusal to sell - a key concept in Economics and Management, Economics Web Institute."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to fixed costs==

Marginal costs are not affected by changes in fixed cost. Marginal costs can be expressed as ∆C(q)∕∆Q. Since fixed costs do not vary with (depend on) changes in quantity, MC is ∆VC∕∆Q. Thus if fixed cost were to double, the cost of MC would not be affected, and consequently, the profit-maximizing quantity and price would not change.  This can be illustrated by graphing the short run total cost curve and the short-run variable cost curve. The shapes of the curves are identical. Each curve initially increases at a decreasing rate, reaches an inflection point, then increases at an increasing rate. The only difference between the curves is that the SRVC curve begins from the origin while the SRTC curve originates on the y-axis. The distance of the origin of the SRTC above the origin represents the fixed cost – the vertical distance between the curves. This distance remains constant as the quantity produced, Q, increases. MC is the slope of the SRVC curve. A change in fixed cost would be reflected by a change in the vertical distance between the SRTC and SRVC curve. Any such change would have no effect on the shape of the SRVC curve and therefore its slope at any point – MC.

==Private versus social marginal cost==
{{main|Social cost}}
Of great importance in the theory of marginal cost is the distinction between the marginal ''private'' and ''social'' costs. The marginal private cost shows the cost associated to the firm in question. It is the marginal private cost that is used by business decision makers in their [[profit maximization]] goals. Marginal social cost is similar to private cost in that it includes the cost of private enterprise but ''also'' any other cost (or offsetting benefit) to society to parties having no direct association with purchase or sale of the product. It incorporates all negative and positive [[externalities]], of both production and consumption. Examples might include a social cost from air pollution affecting third parties or a social benefit from flu shots protecting others from infection.

Externalities are costs (or benefits) that are not borne by the parties to the economic [[Financial transaction|transaction]]. A producer may, for example, [[pollution|pollute]] the environment, and others may bear those costs. A consumer may consume a good which produces benefits for society, such as education; because the individual does not receive all of the benefits, he may consume less than efficiency would suggest. Alternatively, an individual may be a smoker or alcoholic and impose costs on others. In these cases, production or consumption of the good in question may differ from the optimum level.

===Negative externalities of production===
[[Image:NegativeExt.svg|thumb|right|Negative Externalities of Production]]

Much of the time, private and social costs do not diverge from one another, but at times social costs may be either greater or less than private costs. When marginal social costs of production are greater than that of the private cost function, we see the occurrence of a [[negative externality]] of production. Productive processes that result in [[pollution]] are a textbook example of production that creates negative externalities.

Such externalities are a result of firms externalizing their costs onto a third party in order to reduce their own total cost. As a result of externalizing such costs, we see that members of society will be negatively affected by such behavior of the firm. In this case, we see that an increased cost of production in society creates a social cost curve that depicts a greater cost than the private cost curve.

In an equilibrium state, we see that markets creating negative externalities of production will overproduce that good. As a result, the socially optimal production level would be lower than that observed.

===Positive externalities of production===
[[Image:PositiveExt.svg|thumb|right|Positive Externalities of Production]]

When marginal social costs of production are less than that of the private cost function, we see the occurrence of a [[positive externality]] of production. Production of [[public good]]s are a textbook example of production that create positive externalities. An example of such a public good, which creates a divergence in social and private costs, includes the production of [[education]]. It is often seen that education is a positive for any whole society, as well as a positive for those directly involved in the market.

Examining the relevant diagram we see that such production creates a social cost curve that is less than that of the private curve. In an equilibrium state, we see that markets creating positive externalities of production will underproduce that good. As a result, the socially optimal production level would be greater than that observed.

'''Maxine Syjuco''' (born December 1, 1984) is an artist, poet and model from [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. She is the youngest daughter of [[avant-garde]] artists [[Cesare Syjuco]] and [[Jean Marie Syjuco]],&lt;ref&gt;http://theartling.com/artists/maxine-syjuco/&lt;/ref&gt; and is the vocalist and songwriter of the experimental Art Rock band Jack of None.&lt;ref&gt;http://jackofnone.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

Working mainly with [[photography]], [[digital collage]], [[painting]] and [[installation art]], her work possesses an intimate, philosophical, and often twisted voice in storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;http://theartling.com/artists/maxine-syjuco/&lt;/ref&gt; Manipulating faces, unveiling poignant surrealities, and probing into abandoned rooms of the subconscious, Maxine authors dark, thought-provoking introspections of the human condition and its fragility—conjuring a netherworld where ghostly images exist neither here nor there.&lt;ref&gt;http://theartling.com/artists/maxine-syjuco/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artinformal.com/artists/view/217/&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first book of poetry, ''"A Secret Life,"'' was published in 2008 and received critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;http://prairieschooner.unl.edu/people/maxine-syjuco&lt;/ref&gt; Her poems have been translated into Polish and French, and have seen print in several international anthologies including the Asia Literary Review, The Poet’s Guild Quarterly, Chopin with Cherries,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moonrisepress.com/chopin.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2011 Rhino International Poetry Anthology.&lt;ref&gt;http://rhinopoetry.org/the-journal/past-issues/rhino-poetry-2011/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, she was awarded the Independent Music Award in New York City, U.S.A., for Best Album Art, Photography and Design. In the same competition, her band, Jack of None, received 2 category nominations (Best Spoken Word Song, and Best Album of the Year) for their debut album titled "Who's Listening to Van Gogh's Ear?".&lt;ref&gt;http://independentmusicawards.com/blog/2016/11/17/the-15th-independent-music-awards-winners-announced/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/2016/11/28/1647984/flying-syjucos&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxine's exhibits and poetry-performances have taken place in venues as varied as the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Manila]], the Tokiwa Museum of Japan, the Hangaram Museum of Korea, the Art Takes Miami Exhibition in the U.S.A., and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://theartling.com/artists/maxine-syjuco/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8102">'''Misplaced loyalty''' (or '''mistaken loyalty''', '''misguided loyalty''' or '''misplaced trust''') is [[loyalty]] placed in other persons or [[organisations]] where that loyalty is not acknowledged or [[respect]]ed; is [[Betrayal|betrayed]] or taken advantage of. It can also mean loyalty to a malignant or misguided cause.

[[Social psychology (sociology)|Social psychology]] provides a partial explanation for the phenomenon in the way "[T]he [[Norm of reciprocity|norm of social commitment]] directs us to [[Pacta sunt servanda|honor our agreements]]. [...] People usually stick to the deal even though it has changed for the worse".&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007) p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humanism|Humanists]] point out that "[M]an inherits the capacity for loyalty, but not the use to which he shall put it [...] may unselfishly devote himself to what is petty or vile, as he may to what is generous and noble".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur James Balfour, ''Theism and Humanism'' (2000) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the family==

Part of the conventional therapeutic wisdom is 'that those of us who were unlucky enough to be raised by bad parents also get to be burdened as adults by their demands...we maintain a sense of misguided loyalty'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/notes/ruthless-compassion-institute/misplaced-loyalty-toward-hurtful-parents/378824067498 Marcia Sirota, "Misguided Loyalty Toward Hurtful Parents"]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the rubric - 'Misplaced Loyalty: The [[Codependency]] Factor'&lt;ref&gt;J. Middleton-Moz/L. Dwinnell, ''After the Tears'' (2010) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; - the [[self-help]] movement would strongly challenge such loyalty: 'in either individual therapy or self-help groups, the goal is to seek out and replace our misguided loyalty and attachment to our failed parents with attachment to healthier peers'.&lt;ref&gt;David P Celaric, ''Leaving Home'' (2005) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalysis would highlight the accompanying paradox that 'the child, it should be remembered, always defends the bad parent more ferociously than the good'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox may help account for what have been called 'trauma bonds...the misplaced loyalties found in exploitive cults, incest families, or hostage and kidnapping situations, or codependents who live with alcoholics, compulsive gamblers or sex addicts'.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Carnes, ''The Betrayal Bond'' (1997) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional==

'Institutions develop powerful instruments of defence for their protection and perpetuation...develop misguided loyalty to committee and boards. To criticize forcibly rather than to cover up is to rock the boat'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Gittins | first1 = Diana  | author-link= Diana Gittins | contribution = The corridor of power - the 1960s: Russell Barton | editor-last = Gittins | editor-first = Diana | editor-link = Diana Gittins | title = Madness in its place: narratives of Severalls Hospital, 1913-1997 | pages = 83–84 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780415183888 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilmshurst |first=Peter |title=Dishonesty in Medical Research |url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there are 'examples where misguided loyalty on the part of a business owner or manager has led to a decline in a business's performance'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Shenkman, ''The Strategic Heart'' (1996) p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, however, institutions are torn by conflicting codes of loyalty. Thus in the police, in-force loyalty, which 'has sometimes caused officers to lie and cheat on behalf of others...is now regarded as misplaced loyalty': in partial palliation, 'it must be understood that this "looking after one's mates" is a critical element of loyalty for those who face combat'.&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Peters, ''Police under Pressure'' (2007) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==In analytic controversy==

The charge of misplaced loyalty is often used as a weapon in analytic disputes. [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] for example criticised [[Ernest Kris]] for the way 'he accredits this interpretation to "[[ego psychology]]" ''à la'' [[Heinz Hartmann|Hartmann]], whom he believed he was under some obligation to support'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Neville Symington]]'s 'criticism of [[Melanie Klein]] is that...she maintained the concept of the [[Death drive|death instinct]] in order to remain loyal to [[Freud]]'s instinct theory, but it only muddles her otherwise clear formulations'.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==

* 'The [[Sparta]]ns' behaviour at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]]' might be seen as misplaced loyalty, or at least as 'an overriding commitment and loyalty to the good and the absolutely overriding dictates of the state'&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cartledge, ''Thermopylae'' (2007) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; - as an instance when 'unreasoning obedience to a noble but narrow ideal received its logical reward'.&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Castle, ''Ancient Education and Today'' (1969) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been suggested that part of the military problems of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] came from the way the President, [[Jefferson Davis]], 'had a propensity for meddling with commands and a strong but misplaced confidence in lesser men like...[[Braxton Bragg]] and [[P. G. T. Beauregard|Beauregard]]'.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Nye/J. E. Morpurgo, ''A History of the United States'' Vol 2 (Penguin 1955) p. 478&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary==

* [[C. S. Lewis]] in his wartime novel ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' had the following exchange: '"There's such a thing as loyalty", said Jane. McPhee...suddenly looked up with a hundred [[covenanter]]s in his eyes. "There is, Ma'am", he said. "As you get older you will learn that it is a virtue too important to be lavished on individual personalities"'.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''That Hideous Strength'' (London 2005 [1945]) p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;
* On his last day in the C.I.D., [[John Rebus]] reflects guiltily that from his ''first'' day in the C.I.D. he had learnt that '"there's only two teams - us and them ... You covered for mates who'd had too many whiskies with lunch...or gone a bit too far on an arrest...prisoners falling downstairs or stumbling into walls...you covered for ''every''body on your team'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Rankin, ''Exit Music'' (London 2007) p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon is defined as the [[Western media]]'s undue focus on upper-middle-class white women who disappear, with the disproportionate degree of coverage they receive being compared to cases of missing [[women of color]] and missing men and women of lower [[social class]]es.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite news|title=(White) Women We Love|date=June 10, 2005|first=Eugene |last=Robinson|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/09/AR2005060901729.html |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cory L.

Instances have been cited in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa.&lt;ref name=SABC3&gt;{{cite web|title=Oscar Pistorius: The Verdict|url=http://www.sabc3.co.za/sabc/home/sabc3/news/details?id=14721d18-cc3f-42ff-bb32-aea285edbe09&amp;title=Special%20Assignment|accessdate=October 21, 2014|publisher=SABC|date= September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PBS]] news anchor [[Gwen Ifill]] is said to be the originator of the phrase.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"/&gt;  [[Charlton McIlwain]], a professor at [[New York University]], defines the syndrome as white women perpetually occupying a privileged role as violent crime victims in news media reporting, and concludes that missing white woman syndrome functions as a type of [[racial hierarchy]] in the cultural imagery of the West.&lt;ref name=NYU&gt;{{cite news |date=May 9, 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22441124 |title=Cleveland abductions: Do white victims get more attention? |work=BBC |quote=Charlton McIlwain, professor New York University: White women occupy a privileged role as violent crime victims in news media reporting. |accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Eduardo Bonilla-Silva categorizes the racial component of missing white woman syndrome as a form of racial grammar, through which [[white supremacy]] is normalized by implicit or even invisible standards.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt;

Missing white woman syndrome has led to a number of [[Right-wing populism|right-wing]] [[Law and order (politics)|tough on crime]] measures that were named for white women who disappeared and were subsequently found harmed.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Land Stein, University of Southern Mississippi (2012) THE CULTURAL COMPLEX OF INNOCENCE: AN EXAMINATION OF MEDIA AND SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF MISSING WHITE WOMAN SYNDROME http://aquila.usm.edu/dissertations/858/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laurie Essig Ph.D.|date=2014|title=Racial Politics in the US and the Figure of the White Lady.

Also noteworthy was that news coverage of missing black women was more likely to focus on the victim's baggage, such as abusive boyfriends or a troubled past, while coverage of white women tends to focus on their roles as mothers or daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cheryl L.

==Media coverage==
===United States===
With regard to missing children, statistical research which compares national media reports with [[FBI]] data shows that there is marked under-representation of [[African American]] children in media reports&lt;!--of all kinds, or of crimes only?--&gt; relative to non-African American children. A subsequent study found that girls from [[minority group]]s were the most under-represented in these missing-children news reports by a very large margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Min|first=Seong-Jae|author2=John C Feaster|title=Missing Children in National News Coverage: Racial and Gender Representations of Missing Children Cases|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=July–September 2010|volume=27|issue=3|pages=201–216|url=https://www.academia.edu/857391/Missing_Children_in_National_News_Coverage_Racial_and_Gender_Representations_of_Missing_Children_Cases|accessdate=May 9, 2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zach Sommers, a [[Sociology|sociologist]] at [[Northwestern University]], noted that while there is a sizable body of research that shows that white people are more likely than people of color to appear in news coverage as victims of violent crime there is relatively little when it comes to missing persons cases.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; In 2013, Sommers cross-referenced the missing persons coverage of four national and local media outlets against the FBI's missing persons database. Sommers found black people received disproportionately less coverage than whites and men received disproportionately less coverage than women; Sommers could not directly assess the number of missing white women in the FBI files due to how the data was structured but concluded that there was circumstantial—although not statistically conclusive—evidence that white women received disproportionate coverage.&lt;ref name="Demby"&gt;{{cite web |first=Gene |last=Demby |title=What We Know (And Don't Know) About 'Missing White Women Syndrome' |date=April 13, 2017 |publisher=[[NPR]] |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/13/523769303/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-missing-white-women-syndrome |accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; In the same study, professor Eduardo Bonilla-Silva elucidated that the subtle standard of placing a premium on white lives in the news helps to maintain and reinforce a [[racial hierarchy]] with whites at the top. For example, [[black women]] are members of both a marginalized racial group and a marginalized gender group.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; Crucially, though, black women have an “intersectional experience [that] is greater than the sum of [[racism]] and sexism.” In other words, like white women, black women are subject to sexism, but the form of that sexism differs for black women because of the compounding effects of [[racial discrimination]]; with missing white woman syndrome being a pertinent manifestation of this social phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Demby"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; Sociologists note that the tone of media coverage for black female victims differs markedly from coverage of white female victims in that the former are more likely to be blamed for purportedly putting themselves in harm's way, either knowingly or unknowingly. [[Victim blaming]] in this context reinforces the notion that black female victims are not only less innocent, but also less worthy of rescue relative to white women.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; Other observers note the lack of publicity given to black female victims of [[police brutality]] in news coverage, attributing the silence to a tradition of “sexism and [[patriarchy]]” in American society.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt;

A report that aired on [[CNN]] noted the differences between the level of media coverage given to Caucasian women like [[Murder of Laci Peterson|Laci Peterson]] and [[Natalee Holloway]], who disappeared in 2002 and 2005 respectively, and [[Murder of LaToyia Figueroa|LaToyia Figueroa]], a pregnant Black Hispanic woman. Figueroa disappeared in Philadelphia the same year Holloway disappeared. Figueroa and her unborn daughter were found murdered.&lt;ref name=coverage&gt;{{cite news |date=March 17, 2006 |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0603/17/sbt.01.html |title=Race Bias in Media Coverage of Missing Women?; Cheryl Hines Dishes on New Show |work=CNN.com |quote=TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Natalee Holloway, Lori Hacking, Taylor Biehl, the list goes on and on.

Kym Pasqualini, president of the [[National Center for Missing Adults]], observed that media outlets tend to focus on "[[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]" – typically, affluent young white women and teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/forensics/americas_missing/3.html |title=Damsels in Distress |first=David |last=Krajicek |page=3 |work=[[TruTV|TruTV.com]] |accessdate=July 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728062922/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/forensics/americas_missing/3.html |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2016 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' article about the [[disappearance of Tiffany Whitton]], journalist [[Tom Junod]] observed that women of lower social status such as Whitton, a 26-year-old unemployed drug addict who was on parole, do not get much media attention as "media outlets are ruthlessly selective, and they tend to prefer women who are white, pretty, and, above all, innocent". Whitton's mother stated that producers of shows like ''[[Nancy Grace (TV series)|Nancy Grace]]'' told her they weren't interested in her daughter's case.&lt;ref name="Tiffany Whitton"&gt;{{cite news|last=Junod|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Junod|title=Missing: The Curious Anomaly of Tiffany Whitton's Disappearance|url=https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a44402/missing-tom-junod/|newspaper=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=April 29, 2016|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Cory L. Armstrong wrote in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that "the pattern of choosing only young, white, middle-class women for the full damsel treatment says a lot about a nation that likes to believe it has consigned [[Race (human classification)|race]] and [[Social class|class]] to irrelevance".&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"/&gt; 

===Canada===
According to a study published in ''The Law and Society Association'', [[First Nations|aboriginal]] women who go missing in Canada receive 27 times less news coverage than white women; they also receive "dispassionate and less-detailed, headlines, articles, and images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gilchrist |first=Kristen |title=Invisible Victims: Disparity in Print-News Media Coverage of Missing/Murdered Aboriginal and White Women |url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/9/1/4/p239140_index.html |work=AllAcademic.com |date=May 27, 2008 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
University of Leicester Criminology Professor Yvonne Jewkes cites the [[murder of Milly Dowler]], the [[murder of Sarah Payne]], and the [[Soham murders]] as examples of "eminently newsworthy stories" about girls from "respectable" middle-class families and backgrounds whose parents used the news media effectively.&lt;ref name=Jewkes&gt;{{cite book|title=Media and Crime|author=Yvonne Jewkes|pages=52–53|year=2004|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=0-7619-4765-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that, in contrast, the street [[murder of Damilola Taylor]], a 10-year- old boy from Nigeria, initially received little news coverage, with reports initially concentrating upon street crime levels and community policing, and largely ignoring the victim. Even when Damilola's father flew into the UK from Nigeria to make press statements and television appearances, the level of public outcry did not, Jewkes asserts, reach "the near hysterical outpourings of anger and sadness that accompanied the deaths of Sarah, [[Murder of Milly Dowler|Milly]], Holly, and Jessica".&lt;ref name=Jewkes /&gt;

In January 2006, London Police Commissioner [[Ian Blair]] described the media as [[institutional racism|institutionally racist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4651368.stm |title=Met chief accuses media of racism |publisher=BBC News |date=January 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4654224.stm |title=The story of two murder victims |publisher=BBC News |date=January 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, he had referred to the murder of two young girls in [[Soham]] in 2002. He said "almost nobody" understood why it became such a big story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4653130.stm |title=Blair apologises to Soham parents |publisher=BBC News |date=January 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two cases of missing white girl syndrome that have been given as contrasting examples: the [[murder of Hannah Williams]] and the [[murder of Danielle Jones]]. It was suggested that Jones received more coverage than Williams because Jones was a middle-class schoolgirl, whilst Williams was from a working-class background with a [[nose piercing|stud in her nose]] and estranged parents.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Homicide|author=Fiona Brookman|year=2005|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=0-7619-4755-8|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Sandile Memela, chief director for [[social cohesion]] at [[South Africa]]'s [[Department of Arts and Culture (South Africa)|Department of Arts and Culture]], noted amidst the [[Oscar Pistorius]] [[Trial of Oscar Pistorius|trial]] that there existed substantial differences between how media outlets reported on the murders of [[Reeva Steenkamp]] and [[Zanele Khumalo]]; two South African models, respectively white and black, who had been murdered by their boyfriends under nearly identical circumstances.&lt;ref name="Memela"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/the-trial-next-door-oscar-pistorius-gets-the-headlines-but-what-about-thato-kutumela-9194821.html |title=The trial next door: Oscar Pistorius gets the headlines, but what about Thato Kutumela? |publisher=The Independent |date=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memela asserted that the discrepancy between the media coverage of the Steenkamp and Khumala murders amounted to "[[Institutional racism|structural racism]]" within South African society, and stated: "As a country we seem to have chosen to ignore the agony, pain and suffering of the Khumalo family for no other reason than that they are black."&lt;ref name="Memela"/&gt;

On September 11, 2014, the South African news network SABC3 aired an investigative report which raised concerns around the “Missing White Woman Syndrome”; where the death of Steenkamp was juxtaposed with the death of Zanele Khumalo.&lt;ref name="SABC3"/&gt;

===Other alleged cases of disproportionate media interest===
====Jessica Lynch====
[[File:JessicaLynch02.jpeg|thumb|News coverage of [[Jessica Lynch]]'s rescue]]
Social commentaries pointed to media bias in the coverage of soldier [[Jessica Lynch]] versus that of her fellow soldiers, [[Shoshana Johnson]] and [[Lori Piestewa]]. All three were ambushed in the same attack during the [[Iraq War]] on March 23, 2003, with Piestewa being killed and Lynch and Johnson being injured and taken prisoner. Lynch, a young, blonde, white woman, received far more media coverage than Johnson (a black woman and a single mother) and Piestewa (a [[Hopi]] from an impoverished background, and also a single mother), with media critics suggesting that the media gave more attention to the woman with whom audiences supposedly more readily identify.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news |title= A case of race?

Lynch herself leveled harsh criticism at this disproportionate coverage that focused only on her, stating in a congressional testimony before the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]:

{{quote|I am still confused as to why they chose to lie and tried to make me a legend when the real heroics of my fellow soldiers that day were, in fact, legendary. People like Lori Piestewa and First Sergeant Dowdy who picked up fellow soldiers in harm's way. Or people like Patrick Miller and Sergeant Donald Walters who actually fought until the very end. The bottom line is the American people are capable of determining their own ideals of heroes and they don't need to be told elaborate tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20070424110022.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220085535/http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20070424110022.pdf

====Presumed kidnapping of "blonde angel" in Greece====
In October 2013, a girl estimated to be about 4 years of age was found in the custody of a [[Romani people|Roma]] couple in Greece and was presumed to have been abducted.  The story about the "blonde angel" and the search for her biological parents received international media coverage.  A Romani rights activist commented on the case to say "imagine if the situation were reversed and the children were brown and the parents were white".&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/19/21036597-tips-pour-in-after-blonde-girl-without-an-identity-found-in-roma-camp-in-greece Tips pour in after blonde girl 'without an identity' found in Roma camp in Greece] ''[[NBC News]]'' October 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Blumberg (October 28, 2013), [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/antonia-blumberg/blumberg_b_4170868.html Why the Roma 'Blond Angel' Ignited a Week of Racial Profiling] ''[[Huffington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Adams (November 8, 2013), [https://archive.is/20140406192217/http://www.collegiatetimes.com/opinion/article_a879ba26-6391-11e3-99d9-001a4bcf6878.html Abduction case reveals bias on basis of race] ''[[Collegiate Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/world/europe/for-the-roma-fears-of-kidnapping-in-europe-only-mirror-their-own.html For the Roma, Fears of kidnapping in Europe Only Mirror Their Own] ''[[The New York Times]]'' October 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The child was later identified as Maria Ruseva.

====Murder trial defendants====
Critics have also cited excessive media coverage of murder trials where the defendant is female, white, young and attractive, and included them along with Missing White Woman Syndrome instances in an all-encompassing narrative nicknamed the "woman in jeopardy" or "damsel in distress" genre.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farhi"&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Farhi |title=Bad girls and gone girls: Why the media tired of ‘missing white women’ |date=December 13, 2015 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/bad-girls-and-gone-girls-why-the-media-tired-of-missing-white-women/2015/12/09/5660fb52-9934-11e5-94f0-9eeaff906ef3_story.html |accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, the media will focus on the accused, rather than the victim as in Missing White Woman Syndrome cases, and they will be more ambiguous about their guilt than in other criminal cases regardless of evidence. Cited examples include [[Amanda Knox]], [[Jodi Arias]] and [[Casey Anthony]].

==Cited instances==
&lt;!-- THIS IS NOT A LIST OF MISSING PERSONS. ONLY ADD CASES THAT HAVE BEEN LINKED TO MWWS IN RELIABLE SOURCES --&gt;
The following missing person cases have been cited as instances of missing white woman syndrome; media commentators on the phenomenon regard them as garnering a disproportionate level of media coverage relative to contemporary cases involving missing girls or women of non-white ethnicities, and missing males of all ethnicities. The date of death or disappearance is given in parentheses.

'''''Moon Museum''''' is a small [[ceramic]] [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] three-quarters of an inch by half an inch in size,&lt;ref name="History"&gt; [https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/diyinv/2010/06/diy-moon-museum.html Who is John F.?], ''[[History Detectives]]'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], Season 8, Episode 1, June 7, 2010. Accessed July 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; containing artworks by six prominent artists from the late 1960s.

This wafer was supposedly covertly attached to a leg of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module ''Intrepid'']], and subsequently left on the Moon during [[Apollo 12]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cory |first1=Doctorow |title=Secret museum on the moon's surface / Boing Boing |url=https://boingboing.net/2008/02/29/secret-museum-on-the.html |website=boingboing.net |accessdate=21 June 2018 |date=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moon Museum'' is considered the first Space Art object.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tampamuseum.org/exhibitions/current The Moon Museum: First Space Art Object Lands at Tampa Museum of Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714020938/http://www.tampamuseum.org/exhibitions/current |date=2011-07-14 }}. [[Tampa Museum of Art]] June 18 - August 1, 2010. Accessed July 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is impossible to tell if ''Moon Museum'' is actually on the Moon without sending another mission to look, technicians have admitted to placing personal effects onto the Apollo landers, hidden in the layers of gold blankets that wrapped parts of the spacecraft which remained on the Moon after the astronauts departed.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

==History==
The concept for ''Moon Museum'' was brainstormed by Forrest "Frosty" Myers. He stated that "My idea was to get six great artists together and make a tiny little museum that would be on the moon."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Myers attempted several times to get his project sanctioned by [[NASA]]. He claims the agency gave him the runaround and, Myers states, "They never said no, I just could not get them to say anything."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Instead of going through the official channels, he was forced to take the back route and try to smuggle it on board.
[[File:Moon museum nyt.jpg|thumb|left|Image of the Moon Museum from the original ''New York Times'' article. The thumb obscures Warhol's drawing.]]

Myers contacted [[Experiments in Art and Technology]] (E.A.T.), a non-profit group that was linking artists with engineers to create new works. Through E.A.T., Myers was introduced to some scientists from [[Bell Laboratories]], specifically [[Fred Waldhauer]]. Using techniques normally used to produce telephone circuits, the scientists etched the drawings Myers had gathered onto small ceramic wafers. Either 16 or 20 of these wafers were created,&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; with one going on the lunar lander and the rest, copies of the original, handed out to the artists and others involved in the project.&lt;ref name="AOL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aolnews.com/weird-news/article/tiny-art-museum-hidden-aboard-apollo-12-for-its-moon-landing/19516542 |title=Warhol in Space: Apollo 12 Secretly Carried Art to the Moon |last1=Moye |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=17 June 2010 |website=Aol News |publisher= |access-date=14 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618232925/http://www.aolnews.com/weird-news/article/tiny-art-museum-hidden-aboard-apollo-12-for-its-moon-landing/19516542|archivedate=18 June 2010|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When NASA dithered whether the wafer would be allowed onto the module, Waldhauer devised another plan. Waldhauer knew a [[Grumman Aircraft]] engineer who was working on the Apollo 12 lander module, and he proved willing to place the wafer on it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/aboutpbs/news/20100607_historydetectivesandywarholartonmoon.html PBS' HISTORY DETECTIVES PUTS A QUESTION TO THE NATION: IS ANDY WARHOL’S ART ON THE MOON?]. PBS. June 7, 2010. Accessed July 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Myers asked Waldhauer how he would know if the art actually made it onto the lander, and was told that the person who worked for Grumman would send him a [[telegram]] when the wafer was in place. At 3:35 p.m. on November 12, 1969, less than two days before Apollo 12 took off, Myers received a telegram at his house from [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]] stating "YOUR ON' A.O.K. ALL SYSTEMS GO," and signed "JOHN F."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

The existence of the work was not revealed until Myers informed ''[[The New York Times]]'' which ran an article on the story two days after Apollo 12 left the Moon and two days before they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;[http://greg.org/archive/2008/02/28/the_moon_museum.html Holy ^%$&amp;!

There are six artworks located on the ceramic tile, each one in black and white. Starting in the top center is a single line by [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. To its right is a black square with thin white lines intersecting, resembling a piece of circuitry, by David Novros. Below it is  [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]]'s contribution, a template pattern which also resembles circuitry. In the lower middle is a geometric variation on [[Mickey Mouse]], by [[Claes Oldenburg]], a popular motif for the artist at that time. [[Forrest Myers]]  created the work in the lower left, a computer-generated drawing of a "linked symbol" called "Interconnection". Finally, the last drawing in the upper left is by [[Andy Warhol]]. He created a stylized version of his initials which, when viewed at certain angles, can appear as a [[rocket ship]] or a [[penis]].&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="5 July 2015"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stinson |first1=Elizabeth |title=We Sent a Dick Pic to the Moon—And We're Doing It Again |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/we-sent-a-dick-pic-to-the-moon/ |website=WIRED |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.moma.org/collection/works/62272 | title =The Moon Museum | publisher =[[Museum of Modern Art]] | access-date =April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "He was being the terrible bad boy," said Forrest Myers in an interview.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Warhol's work is covered by a thumb in the image often associated with ''Moon Museum'', but other images with the drawing visible can be found.&lt;ref name= "greg" /&gt;

== Definition ==
The idea of motherhood studies was influenced by [[Adrienne Rich]]’s ''Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution'' in 1976. It is consists of three interconnected categories of inquiry: motherhood as institution, motherhood as experience, and motherhood as identity or subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Green|first=Fiona Joy|title=Motherhood Studies|date=2010|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/motherhood/n441.xml|work=Encyclopedia of Motherhood|pages=832–832|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412979276.n441|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motherhood studies is often referred to as a [[Feminism|feminist practice]]. Feminist mothering critiques the sexist and patriarchal values that contemporary society upholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/191767744|title=Feminist mothering|last=1961-|first=O'Reilly, Andrea,|date=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780791475577|oclc=191767744}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of feminist mothering is maternal activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loveless|first=Natalie S.|date=2016-12-15|title=Contemporary Mamactivist Artists: A Forum on Maternal Activist Art for the Studies in the Maternal Special Issue on The Everyday Maternal Practice: Activist Structures in Creative Work, Summer 2016|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/sim.224|journal=Studies in the Maternal|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.16995/sim.224|issn=1759-0434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Samira Kawash argues that "the marginalization of motherhood in feminist thought was not only a political rejection of maternalist politics construed as a conservative backlash to feminism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawash|first=Samira|date=2011-06|title=New Directions in Motherhood Studies|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/658637|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=36|issue=4|pages=969–1003|doi=10.1086/658637|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the leading portals of mother studies is ''The m/other voices foundation'', a non-profit organization in the USA. It emerged in 2014 from Deirdre M. Donoghue's research project ''(m)other voices: the maternal as an attitude, maternal thinking and the  production of time and knowledge'' at [[Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art|Witte de With Centre for Contemporary Art]].  The project's purpose was to initiate discourse and the doing of maternal theory within arts and other fields of cultural production and to reflect on the maternal figure as a thinker and a producer of knowledge.

More and more organized initiatives within academic communities are starting such as the ''[https://jarm.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/jarm/index Motherhood Initiative for Research and Community Involvement]'', a feminist scholarly and activist organization on mothering-motherhood based in Toronto, Canada.

The ''Journal of the Motherhood Initiative'' re-launched in 2010 as a continuation of the ''Journal of the Association for Research on Mothering'' that started in 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1938">The [[National Motor Freight Traffic Association]] publishes the '''National Motor Freight Classification®''' (NMFC®), a standard that provides a comparison of commodities moving in commerce. The NMFC® is developed and maintained by the [[Commodity Classification Standards Board]] (CCSB).  

The NMFC® is a voluntary standard that provides a comparison of commodities moving in interstate, intrastate and foreign commerce. It is similar in concept to the groupings or grading systems that serve many other industries. Commodities are grouped into one of 18 classes—from a low of class 50 to a high of class 500—based on an evaluation of four transportation characteristics: density, stowability, handling and liability. Together, these characteristics establish a commodity’s “transportability.”&lt;ref name="nmfta"&gt;{{cite web|title="The National Motor Freight Classification"|url=http://www.nmfta.org/pages/nmfc|publisher=NMFTA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NMFC® also specifies minimum packaging requirements to ensure that goods are adequately protected in the motor carrier environment and can be handled and stowed in a manner that is reasonably safe and practicable. It contains various rules that govern and otherwise relate to the classification and/or packaging of commodities as well as procedures for the filing and disposition of claims, and procedures governing interline settlements. It also contains the [[Bill of lading|Uniform Straight Bill of Lading]], including its terms and conditions.&lt;ref name="nmfta"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Video games}}
'''Nonviolent video games''' are [[video game]]s characterized by little or no [[Violence#Violence in the media|violence]]. As the term is vague, game designers, developers, and marketers that describe themselves as non-violent video game makers, as well as certain reviewers and members of the non-violent gaming community, often employ it to describe games with ''comparatively'' little or no violence. The definition has been applied flexibly to games in such purposive genres as the [[Christian video game]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Beliefs/story?id=1042784&amp;page=1 Christian Video Games Offer Wholesome Action: Game Makers Hope Non-Violent Alternatives Will Catch On]''. [[ABC News|ABC News/Technology]]. 17 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of games at the fringe of the "non-violence" label can only be viewed as objectively violent.

The purposes behind the development of the nonviolent genre are primarily reactionary in nature. As video quality and level of gaming technology have increased, the violent nature of some video games has gained worldwide attention from moral, political, gender, and medical/psychological quarters. The popularity of violent video games and increases in youth violence have led to much research into the degree to which video games may be blamed for societally negative behaviors. Despite the inconclusive nature of the scientific results, a number of groups have rejected violent video games as offensive and have promoted the development of non-violent alternatives. The existence of a market for such games has in turn led to the manufacture and distribution of a number of games specifically designed for the nonviolent gaming community. Video game reviewers have additionally identified a number of games belonging to traditionally violent gameplay genres as "nonviolent" in comparison to a typical game from the violent genre. Despite the fact that some of these games contain mild violence, many of them have entered the argot of nonviolent gamers as characteristic non-violent games.

==Video game violence and attendant controversies==
{{Main article|Video game controversy#Crime and violence}}

Controversies surrounding the negative influences of video games are nearly as old as the medium itself. In 1964, [[Marshall McLuhan]], a noted media theorist, suggested in his book, ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'', that "[t]he games people play reveal a great deal about them.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]''. Signet. 1964. Re-issued 1994. {{ISBN|0-262-63159-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; " This was built upon in the early 1980s in an anti-video-game crusade spearheaded by the former Long Island PTA president, Ronnie Lamm, who spoke about her cause on the [[PBS NewsHour|MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour]] in December 1982.&lt;ref name=gonzalez&gt;Gonzalez, Lauren. ''[http://www.gamespot.com/features/6090892 When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy]''. [[GameSpot]] feature. Retrieved 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], [[C. Everett Koop]], had suggested that games had no merit and offered little in the way of anything constructive to young people.&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt; Despite early general claims of the negative effects of video games, however, effects of these concerns were relatively minor prior to the early 1990s.

Discussion of the impact of violence in video games came as early as 1976's ''[[Death Race (1976 video game)|Death Race]]'' arcade game (a game with black and white graphics which involved running over screaming zombies).  In the 1980s titles such as Exidy's ''[[Chiller (video game)|Chiller]]'' (1986), Namco's ''[[Splatterhouse]]'' (1987) and Midway's ''[[Narc (video game)|NARC]]'' (1988) raised concerns about video game violence in the arcade. Home games such as [[Palace Software|Palace]]'s ''[[Barbarian (Palace Software)|Barbarian]]'' (1987) featured the ability to decapitate opponents. It was not until graphic capabilities increased and a wave of new ultra-violent titles were released in the early 1990s that the mainstream news began to pay significant attention to the phenomenon. In 1992, with [[Midway Games|Midway]]'s release of the first ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' video game, and then in 1993 with [[id Software|id]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', genuine controversy was first ignited as the wide and growing popularity of violent video games came into direct conflict with the moral and religious ethics of concerned citizens. Protests and [[List of banned video games|game-bannings]] followed the publicizing of these conflicts, and controversies would erupt periodically throughout the 1990s with the releases of such games as ''[[Dreamweb]]'' (1992), ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' (1992), ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' (1993), ''[[Phantasmagoria (video game)|Phantasmagoria]]'' (1995), ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' (1996), ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]'' (1997), ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' (1997), ''[[Carmageddon]]'' (1997), ''[[Postal (video game)|Postal]]'' (1997), ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' (1997), ''[[Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now]]'' (1998), ''[[Blood II: The Chosen]]'' (1998), ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]'' (1999), and ''[[Requiem: Avenging Angel]]'' (1999) among others.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Eric harris dylan klebold.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], shown here on the [[Columbine High School]] security cameras during the [[Columbine High School massacre|massacre]], are alleged to have been directly inspired by such ultra-violent video games as ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', and ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1295920.stm Columbine families sue computer game makers] ''bbc.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailycamera.com/shooting/2002/05lcolu.html |title= Columbine lawsuit over video games dismissed |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428142549/http://www.thedailycamera.com/shooting/2002/05lcolu.html |archivedate=28 April 2006 }} – ''Associated Press (The Daily Camera)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.salon.com/technology/feature/1999/04/23/gamers/index.html| title = Doom, Quake and mass murder | accessdate = 24 August 2008| author = Janelle Brown| date=  23 April 1999| publisher = [[Salon.com]]| language = [[English language|English]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is however without any scientific evidence and under dispute.]] --&gt;
In April 1999, the fears of the media and violence-watch groups were legitimated in their eyes as investigations into the lives of [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], the shooters in the [[Columbine High School massacre]], revealed that they had been fans of the video game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', and had even created [[Doom WAD|levels]] for it today dubbed "the [[Harris levels]]". A great deal of discussion of violence in video games followed this event with strong arguments made on both sides, and research into the phenomenon which had begun during the 1980s received renewed support and interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20080422082626/http://mentalhealth.about.com/cs/familyresources/a/vidgameviolence.htm Violent Video Games Produce Violent Behavior]''. [[About.com]] article. 9 November 2005. Retrieved 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher]], led a study on violence in youth and determined that while the impact of video games on violent behavior has yet to be determined, "findings suggest that media violence has a relatively small impact on violence," and that "meta-analysis [had demonstrated that] the overall effect size for both randomized and correlational studies was small for physical aggression and moderate for aggressive thinking."&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;

Despite this, the controversies and debate have persisted, and this has been the catalyst for the emergence of the non-violent video game genre. Non-violent video games are defined in the negative by a ''[[Modus tollendo ponens]]'' [[Disjunctive syllogism|disjunctive argument]]. In other words, in order to recognize a non-violent game, an identifier must recognize the violent game as a distinct class. This has led to a degree of ambiguity in the term as it relies upon a definition of [[violence]] which for different identifiers may mean different things. In general, violence may be placed into at least three distinct categories:
*Totally non-violent games – Games in which absolutely no violence occurs. This category contains games characterized by lack of the death of characters, lack of sudden noise or movement, and often lack of traditional conflict. (e.g., ''[[Below the Root (video game)|Below the Root]]'' or ''[[Sudoku Gridmaster]]'')
*Games in which the player acts non-violently – Games where violence occurs to the character-player as a result of environmental hazards or enemies but the character-player's reaction is to run away or otherwise distance himself from the violence.
**Games with environmental hazards only – Games lacking enemies, but containing a potentially violent environment (E.g. ''[[Alleyway (video game)|Alleyway]]'', or ''[[Roller Coaster (video game)|Roller Coaster]]'')
**Games with enemies – Games with violent enemies which the player-character must avoid (E.g. the ''[[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland]]'' series)
*Games in which the player acts non-violently to other sentient beings – Games where a player acts violently against robots or other non-living non-sentient enemies (E.g. ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'')

===Education===
The majority of these games have not been scientifically tested to see whether children learn the skills the games claim to teach.In another study performed in Chile, educational video games were put into some first and second grade classrooms. Children who had the games in their classroom showed more progress in math, reading comprehension, and spelling than the children who did not use games in their classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmch.tv/mentors_teachers/video_games_benefits.asp "Are there any benefits of playing video games" Accessed 13 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
{{Main article|Video game effects}}

The [[history of video games|history of video game development]] shares approximate contemporaneity with [[media violence research]] in general. In the early 1960, studies were conducted on the effects of [[adolescents and cartoon violence|violence in cartoons]],&lt;ref&gt;Mussen, P., &amp; Rutherford, E. (1961). ''Effects of aggressive cartoons on children’s aggressive play''. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 62, 461–464.&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the 1970s and 1980s a number of studies were conducted on how televised violence influenced viewers (especially younger viewers). The focus of many of these studies was on the effects of exposure of children to violence, and these studies frequently employed the [[social learning theory]] framework developed by [[Albert Bandura]] to explore violent behavioral modeling.

[[File:David Satcher official photo portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher]] has conducted research in the field of video game violence and has concluded that "findings suggest that media violence has a relatively small impact on [youth] violence."&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;]]
With advancements in video technology and the rise of video games containing graphic violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, media violence research shifted to a great degree from televised violence to video game violence. Although under current debate, a number of researchers have claimed that violent games may cause more intense feelings of aggression than nonviolent games, and may trigger feelings of anger and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C. A., &amp; Bushman, B. J. (2001). ''Effects of violent games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytical review of the scientific literature''. Psychological Science, 12, 353–359.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical explanations for these types of effects have been explained in myriad theories including social cognitive theory, excitation transfer theory, priming effect and the [[Video game effects#General Aggression Model|General Aggression Model]].  However recent scholarship has suggested that social cognitive theories of aggression are outdated and should be retired.&lt;ref&gt;name=Ferguson &amp; Dyck, 2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Christopher|title=Paradigm change in aggression research: The time has come to retire the General Aggression Model|journal=Aggression and Violence Behavior|year=2012|issue=17|pages=220–228|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927103208/http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One difference between video games and television which nearly all media violence studies recognize is that video games are primarily interactive while television is primarily passive in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsh, Stephen J. ''Children, Adolescents, and Media Violence – A Critical Look at the Research''. Media Violence and the Concept of Risk. [[SAGE Publications]]. 2006. p. 276. {{ISBN|0-7619-2976-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Video game players identify with the character they control in the video games and there have been suggestions that the interactivity available in violent video games narrows the gap between the theory and practice of youth violence in a manner that goes beyond the effects of televised violence.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Kelly Stephen. ''[http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-1107102-220029/unrestricted/Meyers_dis.pdf Television and Video Game Violence: Age Differences and the Combined Effects of Passive and Interactive Violent Media]''. Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College – Department of Psychology. December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Patricia Marks and Cocking, Rodney R. ''Interacting with video: Volume 11 of Advances in applied developmental psychology''. Greenwood Publishing Group. 1996. {{ISBN|1-56750-152-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledgment of the fact that, for better or worse, video games are likely to remain a part of modern society has led to a brace of comparative studies between violent games and non-violent games.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;Cooper, J., &amp; Mackie, D. (1986). ''Video games and aggression in children''. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 16(8), 726–744.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamborini, R., Eastin, M. S., Skalski, P., Lachlan, K., Fediuk, T. A., &amp; Brady, R. (2004). ''Violent virtual video games and hostile thoughts''. Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, 48(3), 335–357.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=polman&gt;Polman, H., de Castro, B. O., &amp; van Aken, M. A. G. (2008). ''Experimental study of the differential effects of playing versus watching violent video games on children’s aggressive behavior''. Aggressive Behavior, 34(3), 256–264.&lt;/ref&gt; As technology has advanced, such studies have adapted to include the effects of violent games and non-violent games in new media methods such as immersive virtual reality simulations.&lt;ref&gt;Arriaga, P., Esteves, F., Caneiro, P., &amp; Monteiro, M. B. (2008). ''Are the effects of unreal violent video games pronounced when playing with a virtual reality system?'' Aggressive Behavior, 34(5), 521–538.&lt;/ref&gt;

Results have varied, with some research indicating correlation between violence in video games and violence in players of the games, and other research indicating minimal if any relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Craig &amp; Dill, Karen. ''Video Games and Aggressive Thoughts, Feelings, and Behavior in the Laboratory and in Life''. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, April 2000 Vol. 78, No. 4, 772–790.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silvern, S. B., &amp; Williamson, P. A. (1987). The effects of video game play on young children’s aggression, fantasy, and prosocial behavior. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 8(4), 453–462.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of solid conclusion on the issue, the suggestion that violent games cause youth violence together with the clear popularity of violent video game genres such as the [[first-person shooter]] have led some game designers to publish non-violent alternatives.&lt;ref name=dobson&gt;Dobson, Jason. ''[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=9161 ACE, Christian Developers Conference Focuses On Responsible Game Development]''.

GameZone. 28 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits and legislation===
As research supporting the view that video game violence leads to youth violence has been produced, there have been a number of lawsuits initiated by victims to gain compensation for loss alleged to have been caused by video-game-related violence. Similarly, in the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] and the legislatures of states and other countries, a number of legislative actions have been taken to mandate rating systems and to curb the distribution of violent video games. At times, individual games considered too violent have been censored or banned in such countries as [[Censorship in Australia#Video games|Australia]], [[Law 3037/2002|Greece]], [[List of banned video games|etc.]]

[[File:JackThompsonAttorney.jpg|thumb|200px|Former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] has filed lawsuits against the makers of violent games, alleging the violent content causes real-world violence.]]
In 1997, [[Christian right|Christian conservative]]&lt;ref name=provenzo&gt;Provenzo, Eugene F., Jr. and Jack Thompson. ''[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1019/p09s01-coop.html A political odd couple's advice on finding common ground]''. Christian Science Monitor. 19 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Activism|activist]] and (now former) attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] brought suit against [[Atari]], [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]], and [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] on behalf of the victims of [[Heath High School shooting]] in ''[[Heath High School shooting|James v. Meow Media]]''. The suit was dismissed in 2000, absolving the companies of responsibility for the shooter's actions based on a lack of remedy under Kentucky [[tort]] law.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=16730 Federal appeals panel upholds dismissal of lawsuit against movie, video game makers]''. [[Associated Press]]. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the dismissal, and in 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] denied [[certiorari]], refusing to review the case because it was not dismissed on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=17477 High court won't revive suit blaming Hollywood for school shooting]''.

In 2000, the County Council for St. Louis, Missouri enacted Ordinance 20,193 that barred minors from purchasing, renting, or playing violent video games deemed to contain any visual depiction or representation of realistic injury to a human or a "human-like being" that appealed to minors' "morbid interest in violence."&lt;ref name=krug&gt;Krug, Judith F. &amp; Caldwell-Stone, Deborah. ''[http://www.mediainstitute.org/ONLINE/FAM2003/6-a.html Controversial Ruling Finds Video Games Not Protected Speech]''. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This ordinance was challenged in 2001 by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) as violative of freedom of expression as guaranteed by the first amendment. The IDSA cited the 7th Circuit case of ''American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick''&lt;ref&gt;''American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick'', 244 F.3d 572 (7th Cir. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; as precedent suggesting that video game content was a form of freedom of expression, however in 2002 the Eastern District Court of Missouri ultimately issued the controversial ruling that "video games are not a form of expression protected by the First Amendment" in ''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County''.&lt;ref&gt;''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County'', 200 F. Supp. 2d 1126 (E.D. Mo. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Columbine High School massacre]], a $5 billion lawsuit was filed in 2001 against a number of video game companies and [[id Software]], the makers of the purportedly violent video game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' by victims of the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=13762 Federal suit blames video-game makers for Columbine shooting]''.

The suit was dismissed by Judge Babcock in March 2002 in a ruling suggesting that a decision against the game makers would have a chilling effect on free speech. Babcock noted that "it is manifest that there is social utility in expressive and imaginative forms of entertainment, even if they contain violence."&lt;ref name=AP1/&gt;

In 2003, Washington State enacted a statute banning the sale or rental to minors of video games&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Chris. ''[http://money.cnn.com/2003/05/20/technology/gaminglaw Wash. bans 'violent' game sales]''. CNN/Money. 21 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; containing "aggressive conflict in which the player kill, injures, or otherwise causes physical harm to a human form in the game who is depicted by dress or other recognizable symbols as a public law enforcement officer." In 2004, this statute was subsequently declared an unconstitutional violation of the first amendment right to free speech in the Federal District Court case of ''Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Maleng''.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Irwin. ''Case-in-Point''. Legal Television Network. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Jack Thompson brought suit against [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' in representation of the victims of the [[Devin Moore (murderer)|Devin Moore]] shooting incident. On 7 November 2005, Thompson withdrew from ''[[Strickland v. Sony]]'', stating, "It was my idea [to leave the case]." He was quick to mention that the case would probably do well with or without his presence. This decision followed scrutiny from Judge James Moore, however Thompson claimed he received no pressure to withdraw. At the same time, Judge James Moore had taken the motion to revoke Thompson's license under advisement. Jack Thompson appeared in court to defend his ''[[pro hac vice]]'' right to practice law in Alabama, following accusations that he violated legal ethics.&lt;ref&gt;DeWitt, Robert.

In 2005, California State Senator, [[Leland Yee]] introduced [[California Assembly Bills 1792 &amp; 1793]] which barred ultra-violent video games and mandated the application of [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] ratings for video games. Yee, a former [[Developmental psychology|child psychologist]] has [[Leland Yee#Video game controversies|publicly criticized]] such games as ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' and ''[[Manhunt 2]]'', and opposes the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s ''Global Gaming League''. Both of these bills were passed by the assembly and signed by Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in October 2005. By December 2005, both bills had been struck down in court by Judge Ronald Whyte as unconstitutional, thereby preventing either from going into effect on 1 January 2006. Similar bills were subsequently filed in such states as Michigan and Illinois, but to date all have been ruled to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, Patrick R.

Houston Law Review&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, in reaction to such controversial games as ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] along with Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Evan Bayh]], introduced the [[Family Entertainment Protection Act]] (S.2126), intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games by imposing a federal mandate for inclusion of [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] ratings.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4682533.stm Clinton wades into GTA sex storm]''.

In June 2006, the Louisiana case of ''[[Entertainment Software Association v. Foti]]'' struck down a state statute that sought to bar minors from purchasing video games with violent content. The statute was declared an unconstitutional violation of the 1st Amendment. Amici filing briefs included [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]].

On 27 September 2006, Senator [[Sam Brownback]] (R-KS) introduced the United States [[Truth in Video Game Rating Act]] (S.3935). The act would require the ESRB to have access to the full content of and hands-on time with the games it was to rate, rather than simply relying on the video demonstrations submitted by developers and publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Proposes New ESRB Legislation|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11030|work = [[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=9 October 2008}} 27 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Congressman [[Fred Upton]] introduced the [[Video Game Decency Act]] (H.R.6120) to the House.

===Degrees of violence===
{{Main article|Video game content rating system}}

Video game rating boards exist in a number of countries, typically placing restrictions (suggested or under force of law) for content that is violent or sexual in nature. About 5% of games fall into a category rated "mature" and recommended to those 17 years old and older. Those games account for about a quarter of all video game sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-06-27-supreme-court-violent-video-games_n.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Joan | last1=Biskupic | first2=Mike | last2=Snider | title=Supreme Court rejects ban on violent video games | date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamers seeking violence find themselves increasingly age restricted as identified violence level increases. This means that non-violent games, which are the least restricted, are available to all players at any age. This moral or legislative public policy against violence has the indirect effect of encouraging players of all ages and especially younger players to play non-violent games, however it also produces something of a [[forbidden fruit]] effect. For this and other reasons, the effectiveness of rating systems such as the ESRB to actually curb violent gameplay in youth gaming has been characterized as futile.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. David Walsh (21 March 2000).

The number of studies in this field has blossomed contemporaneously with greater [[gender studies]], and a degree of tension exists in the field between the traditional stereotype of violence as a male-dominant characteristic and the realities of the marketing data for violent games.

In 2008, an example of such studies was funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice to the Center for Mental Health and Media.&lt;ref&gt;Olson CK, Kutner LA, Warner DE, Almerigi JB, Baer L, Nicholi AM Jr, &amp; Beresin EV: ''Factors correlated with violent video game use by adolescent boys and girls''. Journal of Adolescent Health, 2007, 41: 77–83&lt;/ref&gt; These studies were released in the book, ''[[Grand Theft Childhood]]'', wherein it was found that among girls, nine of the "top ten [most popular video games] were nonviolent games such as ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' titles, ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' or [[Game (simulation)|simulation game]]s" compared to a majority of violent games in the top ten favorites of boys.&lt;ref&gt;Kutner, Lawrence, Ph.D. and Olson, Cheryl K., Sc.D.

[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. 15 April 2008. {{ISBN|0-7432-9951-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the conclusion reached in ''Grand Theft Childhood'' was that "focusing on such easy but minor targets as violent video games causes parents, social activists and public-policy makers to ignore the much more powerful and significant causes of youth violence that have already been well established, including a range of [non-gender-linked] social, behavioral, economic, biological and mental-health factors."&lt;ref&gt;Kutner, Lawrence, Ph.D. and Olson, Cheryl K., Sc.D.

[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. 15 April 2008. {{ISBN|0-7432-9951-5}}. p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion supports [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher|Satcher]]'s 2001 study (''supra'').&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;

Despite this conclusion, general awareness of the issue together with traditional stereotyping has led a number of game developers and designers to create non-violent video games specifically for [[girl gamer|female audiences]]. Advertisement placement and other marketing techniques have in the past targeted women as more receptive to non-violent video game genres such as [[life simulation game]]s, [[strategy game]]s, or [[puzzle video game]]s. Although these genres often contain certain degrees of violence, they lack the emphasis on graphic violence characterized for instance by the [[first-person shooter]] genre.

==Religious perspective==
Criticism for the violent aspects of video game culture has come from a number of anti-violence groups, and perhaps the most vocal of these are the numerous religious opposition groups. The moral codes of nearly all major religions contain prohibitions against murder and violence in general. In some cases this prohibition even extends to aggression, wrath, and anger. Violent video games, while merely vicarious in nature, have been the focus of religious disapproval or outrage in various circles.&lt;ref name=nash/&gt; Notable anti-violent-video-game crusader, former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] is a self proclaimed [[Christian right|Christian conservative]],&lt;ref name=provenzo/&gt; and his legal actions against violent video games have been intimately linked to his religious views. As groups like the [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] population have increased in number of adherents, new marketing opportunities have developed contemporaneously.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;Davis, Matthew. ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4534835.stm Christians purge video game demons]''. BBC News – Washington. 24 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Several religion-centric games forums such as [[GameSpot]]'s [[GameSpot#Forums|"Religion and Philosophy" forum]] have developed within the greater gaming community in reaction to this growing niche.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gamespot.com/pages/unions/forums/show_topics.php?board_id=909179086&amp;union_id=7382 Religion and Philosophy]''.

===Christian games===
{{Main article|Christian video game}}
There has been a rapid increase in [[Christian video game]]s in the last decade,&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; however as Christian games have striven to compete with their more popular secular progenitors, there has been an increasing number of games released that blur the lines between Christian and non-Christian values.&lt;ref&gt;Hutson, Jonathan. ''[http://www.talk2action.org/story/2006/5/29/195855/959 The Purpose Driven Life Takers (Part 1)]''. Talk to Action. 29 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Thompson, for instance, has publicly decried such Christian games as ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]'', stating "It's absurd, ... you can be the Christians blowing away the infidels, and if that doesn't hit your hot button, you can be the Antichrist blowing away all the Christians."&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;Chmielewski, Dawn C. ''[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/10/business/fi-godgames10/2 Converting Video Games Into Instruments of God]'' LA Times. 10 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (The game reviewers [[IGN]], [[Ars Technica]] and [[GameSpy]] have disagreed that "Left Behind: Eternal Forces" is overtly violent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.ign.com/articles/745/745956p1.html IGN: Left Behind: Eternal Forces Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/reviews/2006/12/leftbehind.ars Ars Technica: Left Behind: Eternal Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/left-behind-eternal-forces/749748p1.html GameSpy: Left Behind: Eternal Forces Review]&lt;/ref&gt;) Similarly, James Dobson, PhD., founder of the [[Focus on the Family]] group, has advised parents in relation to video games to "avoid the violent ones altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, James. Dr. ''[http://www.uexpress.com/focusonthefamily/index.html?uc_full_date=20041010 Teen's Hard Times Can Help Build Character]''. 10 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Super 3D Noah's Ark.png|frame|In the [[Christian video game]], ''[[Super 3D Noah's Ark]]'', the player takes the role of [[Noah]] as he non-violently shoots food with a slingshot in order to sate hordes of ravening animals.]]
Although Christian games have been around since [[Sparrow Records]]' ''[[Music Machine (album series)#Spin-offs|Music Machine]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]], there have been few genres as unassailably violent as that of the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS). The majority of games that have been [[List of banned video games|banned]] for violence have been FPS games, and for this reason, Christian games in the FPS genre have struggled to overcome the blurring effects of the violence inherent to the genre. Games such as ''[[Revelation 7 (video game)|Revelation 7]]'' and ''[[Xibalba (video game)|Xibalba]]'', for instance, have attempted to avoid claims of violence by using "off the wall" [[absurdism|absurdist]] humor with enemies such as flying, bat-winged clown heads (modeled after the biblical [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]]) that shoot rays out of their nose, or alien Nazis (a mocking reference to [[Raëlism|Raëlian]] religious beliefs)&lt;ref name=linder&gt;Linder, Matthew. ''Marty Bee Interview''. Gamepraise.net (also available at Objectiveministries.org). 1 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian FPS games such as ''[[Eternal War]]'' have avoided the issue by expressing the view that justified violence is morally acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twoguyssoftware.ca/ Xrucifix]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these games, despite containing objectively violent content, have been affirmatively labeled "non-violent video games" by marketers and faith-based non-violent gaming communities. In direct response to the [[Columbine High School massacre]] (alleged to have been caused by the shooters' obsession with the game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''), Rev. Ralph Bagley began production on ''[[Catechumen (video game)|Catechumen]]'', a Christian first-person game produced by N'Lightening Software involving holy swords instead of guns.&lt;ref&gt;Dee, Jonathan. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01GAMES.html PlayStations of the Cross]''. New York Times. 1 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Catechumen'', the player fights inhuman demons using holy armament. When "sent back" the demons produce no blood or gore, and for this reason it has been described as a non-violent game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/disneys-atlantis-the-lost-empire Metacritic Game Review]&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of ''Catechumen'', according to Rev. Bagley, is "to build the genre of Christian gaming. People are tired of having these violent, demonic games dictating to their kids."&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; Among Christian FPS games, a lack of gore has often been used as the minimum standard for non-violence. Christian game reviewers have at times characterized non-Christian games such as ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' and ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'' as comparatively non-violent games despite their lack of a Christian focus.

An example of a notable Christian video game organization is the Christian Game Developers Foundation, focusing on [[Family-friendliness|family-friendly]] gameplay and Biblical principles. Another well known Christian video game creator and distributor is [[Wisdom Tree]] which is best known for its unlicensed Christian video games on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].

===Hindu games===
In 2006, Escapist magazine reported that a Hindu first-person shooter entitled ''My Hindu Shooter'' was in the works.&lt;ref&gt;Varney, Allen. ''[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_66/385-My-Hindu-Shooter My Hindu Shooter]''. 10 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''My Hindu Shooter'', a game based on the [[Unreal Engine]], the player employs the [[Vedas|Vedic]] abilities of [[Jyotiṣa|astrology]], [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic healing]], breathing (meditation), [[herbalism]], [[Gandharva Kingdom#Gandharva Chitrasena|Gandharva Veda music]], architecture (which let you purify demonic areas) and [[Yajna|yagyas]] (rituals). Gameplay involved acquisition of the [[siddhi]]s of clairvoyance, levitation, invisibility, shrinking and strength, and the ultimate goal of the game was to achieve pure consciousness by removing [[karma]] through completion of quests and cleansing the six [[chakra]]s in ascending order.&lt;ref&gt;Kietzmann, Ludwig.

===Buddhist games===
According to Buddhist morality, the first of the [[Five Precepts]] of [[Śīla]] is a personal rule of not killing. This moral guideline extends to human as well as non-human life. 
There are five conditions to violate the first precept:
# The being must be alive. 
# There must be the knowledge that it is a sentient living being. 
# There must be an intention to cause death. 
# An act must be done to cause death. 
# There must be death, as the result of the said act.

{{Original research|section|date=July 2014}}As the first precept requires an actual living being to be killed to be considered as violated, Buddhists can still enjoy video games with violence because there is no real being that is dying or being hurt. The fuller extent of the first precept is to maintain a harmless attitude towards all. The main problem is the mind, which is the main focus of Buddhism. Violent video games tend to create ill-will and tension, thus it is not conducive for meditation practice. Other than that, the action of the mind also creates ''kamma'' (action) which will bear its fruit when the conditions are right.

Although primarily [[browser game]]s, a number of stand-alone video games eschewing violence, such as the 2007 Thai game ''Ethics Game'' have been created that promote the Five Precepts and Buddhism generally.&lt;ref&gt;Sherriff, Lucy.

===Muslim games===
Despite notoriety in the Western press for controversial violent games such as ''[[Under Ash]]'', and ''[[Under Siege (2005 video game)|Under Siege]]'', Muslim developer Afkar Media has also produced at least one non-violent game entitled ''Road Block Buster''. In ''Road Block Buster'' the hero must "jump[] around [] doing tricks to soldiers ...

===Religion neutral games===
Non-profit organization [http://heartseed.sourceforge.net/ Heartseed] set out to produce several non-violent games, drawing inspiration from a claimed agreement between several religions under the sign of nonviolence: "Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism and others, – because throughout all of them can be found a common thread of  decency meant to propel us toward spiritual enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://heartseed.sourceforge.net/about.php Heartseed's About Page ]''&lt;/ref&gt; This project seems to have been discontinued.

==Types of non-violent video games==
Non-violent video games as a genre are characterized as a [[Video game genres#Video game genres by purpose|genre by purpose]]. Unlike genres described by style of gameplay, non-violent video games span a wide number of gameplay genres. Defined in the negative, the purpose of non-violent games is to provide the player with an experience that ''lacks'' violence. Many traditional gameplay genres naturally lack violence and application of the term "non-violent video games" to titles that fall under these categories raises no questions regarding accuracy. For game developers and designers who self-identify as non-violent video game makers, however, the challenge has been to expand the concepts of non-violence into such traditionally violent gameplay genres as [[action game]]s, [[role-playing game (video games)|role-playing games]], [[strategy game]]s, and the [[first-person shooter]].&lt;ref name=linder/&gt;

[[Video game genres#Other notable genres|Emergent and more recent gameplay genres]] such as [[music video game]]s are for the most part naturally non-violent. [[Video game genres#Video game genres by purpose|Purposive video game genres]] such as [[educational game]]s also are primarily non-violent in nature. Other electronic game genres like [[audio game]]s are also most frequently non-violent. The indisputably non-violent nature of these games are often considered self-evident by members of both the non-violent gaming community and the gaming community at large. As such they are often not explicitly identified as such. Typically, explicit identification is applied counterintuitively to titles where there might otherwise be a question concerning non-violence. This has led such categorization to be viewed with mistrust, hostility, and mockery&lt;ref name=brown&gt;Brown, Seth. ''[http://www.cracked.com/article_15672_praystation-6-most-misguided-christian-video-games.html PrayStation: The 6 Most Misguided Christian Video]''. [[Cracked.com]]. August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; by those who fail to recognize the comparative nature of the definition or who disagree fundamentally with the underlying purpose of the genre.

===Traditionally non-violent games===
[[File:KMines.png|thumb|Games like ''[[Minesweeper (video game)|Minesweeper]]'' contain traditionally non-violent [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] aspects, though minesweeper takes its name from a facet of war.]]
Among traditionally non-violent games are included [[List of maze video games|maze games]], [[adventure game]]s, [[life simulation game]]s, [[construction and management simulation]] games, and some [[vehicle simulation game]]s among others. These games are generally less frequently described as non-violent due to the self-evident nature of the descriptive term. Prior to the development of games specifically designed for non-violence, non-violent gamers were limited to these traditionally non-violent genres, however a number of games even under the traditionally non-violent umbrella may be considered arguably violent. ''[[Minesweeper (computer game)|Minesweeper]]'', for instance, is an abstraction of a scenario that often leads to a patently violent result.

Other common traditionally non-violent genres include [[adventure game]]s, [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]]s, [[music video game]]s, [[programming game]]s, [[Party video game|party games]], and traditional games.

Examples of traditionally non-violent games include:
*''[[Sudoku Gridmaster]]'' – A totally non-violent game wherein the player must assign the mathematically appropriate number to the corresponding blank in a grid.
*''[[Roller Coaster (video game)|Roller Coaster]]'' – A game featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player must navigate a dangerous amusement park to collect pieces of money.
*''[[Alleyway (video game)|Alleyway]]'' – A game with only environmental hazards featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player must break blocks (mild violence) with a ball while avoiding the floor of the level.
*The ''[[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland]]'' series – A series with enemies featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player must solve block-sliding puzzles in order to secure a key and unlock the door to the next room.
*''[[Robots (1984 video game)|Robots]]'' – A game lacking violence to sentient beings wherein a player must either bomb malfunctioning robots or conserve bombs by stepping strategically in order to induce the robots to crash into one another.

===Non-violent action games===
[[File:Seiklus.jpg|thumb|''[[Seiklus]]'' is a [[platform game|platformer]] that lacks much of the violence traditionally associated with platformers.]]
Action games have typically been among the most violent of video games genres with the liberal employment of enemies to thwart the actions of the player-character, and an emphasis on killing these enemies to neutralize them. As action games have developed they have become progressively more violent over the years as advances in graphic capabilities allowed for more realistic enemies and death sequences. Nevertheless, some companies like [[Nintendo]] have tended to shy away from this kind of realism in favor of cartoon and fantasy violence, a concept also implicated in the increase of youth violence by [[media violence research]]ers. This has created a spectrum of violence in action games. Non-violent video game proponents have labeled a number of games containing comparatively low-level violence as non-violent as well as games such as the anti-violent [[serious game]], ''[[Food Force]]''.

Studies have also shown that there are tangible benefits to violence in action games such as increased ability to process visual information quickly and accurately. This has led to support for the development of action games that are non-violent which will allow players to retain the positive visual processing benefits without the negatives associated with violence.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Mark.

====Non-violent first person shooters====
The application of the term "non-violent" to genres such as the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS), that many players consider ''inherently'' or ''definitionally'' violent, has at times generated vociferous arguments that the concept is inconceivable and at best oxymoronic. This argument typically derives from a strict definition of violence as "extreme, destructive, or uncontrollable force especially of natural events; intensity of feeling or expression,&lt;ref&gt;''violence''. Encarta. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; " a definition by which the vast majority of video games may be described as violent. Despite arguments to the contrary, however, such characterizations have been employed as a marketing tool by makers and distributors of non-violent video games, and the degree of popularity enjoyed by games so described may be attributed to the comparative violence of other more violent members of the supergenre.

Non-violent first-person shooter developers have expressed the notion that it is the challenge of making a non-violent game in a violent genre that motivates them in part.&lt;ref name=linder/&gt; Rarely, FPS games such as ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' and ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' that have been developed without the specific intent of non-violence have been identified by reviewers and the non-violent gaming community as non-violent FPSes.&lt;ref name=gigaom&gt;Au, Wagner James.

V.17 No.21. 22–28 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Such characterizations have led to the concern that parents may allow their children to play these games, not realizing that there are still some elements of violence including violent deaths. Further ambiguities arise when determining whether a game is a first-person ''shooter'', as in certain games such as ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'', the player doesn't shoot anything at all, but merely clicks walls with the cursor. Similarly, in games such as ''[[Myst#Remakes and rereleases|realMyst]]'', the player merely interacts with the environment by touching things in the first-person and the term "shooter" is seen to be objectively inaccurate. Despite this, non-violent first-person games have often been characterized oxymoronically as shooters because of all comparable genres, these games are most closely similar to the FPS and often employ engines designed for the FPS genre.

Often modeled upon violent FPS games, non-violent FPSes such as ''[[Chex Quest]]'' or the newer Sherlock Holmes games, may bear striking resemblance to the violent game whose engine they are using. Developers of such games often have done little to change the game other than replacing violent or scary imagery and recasting the storyline to describe "zorching", "slobbing", or otherwise non-lethally incapacitating enemies. Examples of simple changes intended to reduce violence for non-violent FPSes include the alteration of the red shroud from the death-sequence in ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' to become the green shroud from the slime-sequence in ''Chex Quest'' or the removal of the red shroud from the death-sequence in ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' for the deaths in ''Portal''. At times, similarities between violent progenitors and their non-violent descendants have proved strong enough that the non-violent developers have cast their game as a spoof of the violent version. This is apparent in ''Chex Quest''. Off-beat and absurdist humor have been employed in a number of games order to tone down the serious content by makers of non-violent FPSes.&lt;ref name=linder/&gt;

One subgenre of the FPS that typically is not characterized as non-violent despite the fact that gameplay revolves to a great degree around avoidance of battle, is that of [[stealth game]]s. Although much of the gameplay characteristic to stealth games accords closely with the requirements of the non-violent genre, stealth games most frequently simply delay chaotic violence to focus instead upon controlled precision violence.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} When stealth and violence are both present as options, stealth is often presented as the superior option for being morally superior or requiring greater skill.&lt;ref name="kotakuDishonoredParty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/dishonoreds-party-level-rewrote-the-rules-of-stealth-ga-1613011624|last=Burford|first=GB|work=Kotaku|title=Dishonored's Party Level Rewrote The Rules Of Stealth Games|date=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-violent role-playing games===
[[File:Spritual warfare.PNG|frame|The [[Christian video game|Christian RPG]], ''[[Spiritual Warfare (video game)|Spiritual Warfare]]'', features a non-violent hero who spreads repentance by sharing holy fruit]]
Though infrequently regarded as explicitly violent, role-playing video games (RPGs) have traditionally focused on the adventures of a party of travelers as they spend days and months leveling-up to fight greater and greater foes. Fighting in these games is highly stylized and often turn-based, however the actions of the player-characters and the enemies that attack them are distinctly violent. There have been some attempts made to reduce this violence by rendering it in cartoonish format as in some members of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series{{Citation needed|date = July 2009}} or by recasting the enemies' deaths as "fainting," "sleeping," or becoming "stunned" as in the ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' series, however neither of these series has been explicitly labeled non-violent.

One rare example of an RPG that was designed as a non-violent video game is ''[[Spiritual Warfare (video game)|Spiritual Warfare]]'', a game with enemies featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player wanders about converting the denizens of his town to Christianity while fending off the attacks of wild animals with holy food. Another example is ''[[A Tale in the Desert]]'', an [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] based on economic development.

Secular examples include Capcom's ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;Landis, Shawn. ''Capcom's Ace Attorney Video Game''. 24 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savino, Candace. ''[http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/28/ds-fanboy-review-apollo-justice-ace-attorney DS Fanboy Review: Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney]''. 28 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Interactive Software|Victor]]'s ''[[Story of Seasons (series)|Story of Seasons]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nowar-paix.ca/goodvideogames/index.html Recommended Nonviolent Video Games]''. NoWar list.&lt;/ref&gt; – a simulation/RPG game. Additionally, such RPGs as  ''[[Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar]]'', ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', and ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' have all been identified as containing certain modes of play that are mostly non-violent. This concept is also explored in the higher difficulty levels of the [[Thief (series)|''Thief'' series]].

In 2015 the fan-funded indie RPG ''[[Undertale]]'' allowed players to choose whether or not to use violent methods, in a story that includes both explicit and subtextual commentary on the nature of violence in videogames.

===Non-violent strategy games===
As with role-playing games, strategy games have traditionally focused on the development and expansion of a group as they defend themselves from the attacks of enemies. Strategy games tend not to be explicitly described as violent, however they nearly universally contain violent content in the form of battles, wars, and other skirmishes. Additionally, strategy games tend to more often strive for realistic scenarios and depictions of the battles that result. Counteracting this violence, however, is the fact that strategy games tend to be set at a distant third party perspective and as such the violence of the battles tends to be minute and highly stylized.

For the most part, non-violent groups have not explored this genre of violent game. Gender-marketers have designed strategy games for both male and female audiences, however gender-linked treatment of violence has not occurred in this genre and as such, male- and female-oriented strategy games tend to contain equal degrees of violence. Christian developers have made various attempts at the genre including ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]'' in which the player attempts to convert as many civilians in an apocalyptic future as possible by raising their spirit level and shielding them from the corrupting influences of rock-and-roll music and general secularism. The game has been criticized by such anti-violent video game personalities as former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]]&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; for strategy involving the slaying of infidels and non-believers, and for the ability of players engaged in multi-play modes to play as the Antichrist on the side of the Forces of Satan.

Secular non-violent video game designers have emerged from the [[serious game]]s movement and include such anti-violence titles as ''[[PeaceMaker (computer game)|PeaceMaker]]'', a game where the player tries to foster peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and ''[[A Force More Powerful]]'', a nonviolence-themed game designed by [[Steve York]], a documentary filmmaker  and director of Bringing Down a Dictator, a non violent resistance film featuring Ivan Marovic, a resistance leader against [[Slobodan Milošević]] who was instrumental in bringing him down in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Troeh, Eve. ''[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5342543 Video Game Teaches Non-Violent Solutions]''. [[National Public Radio]]. 14 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krotoski, Aleks. ''[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2006/may/08/seriousgamere Serious game: resolving conflict with non-violent means]''. The Guardian. 8 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Though these games are anti-violent, however, failure on the part of the player leads to violence. Thus the goal of the game is merely shifted to active violence-prevention while the degree of violence used to challenge the player remains consistent with violent strategy games.

Some examples of relatively nonviolent strategy games include:
*''[[M.U.L.E.]]''&lt;ref name="anderson198312"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n12/114_MULE.php | title=M.U.L.E | accessdate=March 17, 2011 | author=Anderson, John J. | date=December 1983 | publisher=Creative Computing | pages=114 | quote=I should also mention that there is no shooting to be found anywhere in the game.

===Non-violent sports games and non-violent vehicle simulations===
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
According to the Funk and Buchman method for [[Game classification#Electronic games|classifying video games]], there are six categories into which games may be divided:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Children, Adolescents and the Media|author=[[Victor C. Strasburger]] and Barbara J. Wilson|pages=122–123|year=2002|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0-7619-2125-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#general entertainment (no fighting or destruction)
#educational (learning or problem solving)
#fantasy violence (cartoon characters that must fight or destroy things, and risk being killed, in order to achieve a goal)
#human violence (like fantasy violence, but with human rather than cartoon characters)
#nonviolent sports (no fighting or destruction)
#sports violence (fighting or destruction involved)

The separation of violent and nonviolent sports here illustrates a phenomenon also recognizable in the [[vehicle simulation game]] genre. With both sport and vehicle simulation games, gameplay has traditionally been highly bipolar with nearly as many violent titles as non-violent. Just as there are non-violent and ''violent'' sports games, so too are there [[flight simulator|flight]] and [[combat flight simulator|''combat'' flight simulators]], [[Space simulator|space flight]] and [[Space flight simulator game|space ''combat'' simulators]], and [[Racing video game|racing game]]s and [[vehicular combat game|vehicular ''combat'' games]]. Distinction of games as violent or non-violent here serves a purely practical purpose as gameplay may differ considerably beyond the merely aesthetic.

Such sports as [[Table tennis|Ping-pong]], [[golf]], and [[Cue sports|billiards]], have in the past been identified as nonviolent.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent, Martin. ''[http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/37171/Twisted_List_Top_Nonviolent_Sports_Games.html Twisted List: Top Nonviolent Sports Games]''. G4TV TechTV Vault. 16 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of a nonviolent game that has been employed in a number of studies and government committee reports is ''[[NBA Jam: Tournament Edition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsh, S. J. (1998). ''Seeing the world through Mortal Kombat-colored glasses: violent video games and the development of a short-term hostile attribution bias''. Childhood, 5 (2), 177–184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, Joanne.

A '''peasant''' is a [[pre-industrial]] agricultural laborer or [[farmer]], especially one living in the [[Middle Ages]] under [[feudalism]] and paying rent, tax, fees, or services to a landlord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/139355?rskey=ke8Dz2&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false peasant, def. A.1.a. n. OED Online. March 2012. Oxford University Press. 28 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peasant Merrian-Webster online "peasant"]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Europe, peasants were divided into three classes according to their personal status: [[Slavery|slave]], [[Serfdom|serf]], and free tenant. Peasants either hold title to land in [[fee simple]], or hold land by any of several forms of [[land tenure]], among them [[socage]], [[quit-rent]], [[Leasehold estate|leasehold]], and [[copyhold]].&lt;ref name="Webster2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=Hutton|title=Early European History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1rpEHPuAgncC&amp;pg=PA440|accessdate=3 June 2012|date=1 June 2004|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4191-1711-4|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "peasant" is—and long has been—often used pejoratively to refer to poor or landless farmers and agricultural workers, especially in the poorer countries of the world in which the agricultural labor force makes up a large percentage of the population.  The implication of the term is that the "peasant" is uneducated, ignorant, and unfamiliar with the more sophisticated mannerisms of the urban population.

The word '''peasantry''' is also commonly used in a non-pejorative sense as a [[collective noun]] for the rural population in the poor and under-developed countries of the world.

==Etymology==
[[File:1794 Morgenstern Bauernhof anagoria.JPG|upright=1.5|thumb|A farm in 1794]]

The word "peasant" is derived from the 15th century French word ''païsant'' (compare [[Italian language|Italian]] ''paesano''), meaning one from the ''pays'', or countryside; ultimately from the Latin ''pagus'', or outlying administrative district.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary'' p. 846, 866.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social position==
Peasants typically made up the majority of the agricultural labour force in a [[pre-industrial society]]. The majority of the people in the Middle Ages were peasants.

Though "peasant" is a word of loose application, once a [[market economy]] had taken root, the term ''peasant proprietors'' was frequently used to describe the traditional rural population in countries where [[smallholder]]s farmed much of the land. More generally, the word "peasant" is sometimes used to refer pejoratively to those considered to be "lower class", perhaps defined by poorer education and/or a lower income.

==Medieval European peasants==
The [[open field system]] of agriculture dominated most of northern Europe during medieval times and endured until the nineteenth century in many areas.  Under this system, peasants lived on a [[manor]] presided over by a [[Lord of the manor|lord]] or a [[bishop]] of the [[Catholic church|church]].  Peasants paid rent or labor services to the lord in exchange for their right to cultivate the land.  Fallowed land, pastures, forests, and wasteland were held in common.  The open field system required cooperation among the peasants of the manor.&lt;ref&gt;Gies, Frances and Joseph.  ''Life in a Medieval Village''  New York: Harper, 1989, pp 12-18&lt;/ref&gt; It was gradually replaced by individual ownership and management of land.

The relative position of peasants in Western Europe improved greatly after the [[Black Death]] had reduced the population of [[medieval Europe]] in the mid-14th century: resulting in more land for the survivors and making labor more scarce. In the wake of this disruption to the established order, later centuries saw the invention of the printing press, the development of widespread [[literacy]] and the enormous social and intellectual changes of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

The evolution of ideas in an environment of relatively widespread literacy laid the groundwork for the [[Industrial Revolution]], which enabled mechanically and chemically augmented agricultural production while simultaneously increasing the demand for [[Industrial labour|factory workers]] in cities, who became what [[Karl Marx]] called the [[proletariat#Usage in Marxist theory|proletariat]]. The trend toward individual ownership of land, typified in England by [[Enclosure]], displaced many peasants from the land and compelled them, often unwillingly, to become urban [[factory]]-workers, who came to occupy the socio-economic stratum formerly the preserve of the medieval peasants.

This process happened in an especially pronounced and truncated way in Eastern Europe. Lacking any catalysts for change in the 14th century, Eastern European peasants largely continued upon the original medieval path until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Serfdom]] was abolished in Russia in 1861, and while many peasants would remain in areas where their family had farmed for generations, the changes did allow for the buying and selling of lands traditionally held by peasants, and for landless ex-peasants to move to the cities.&lt;ref&gt;David Moon, ''The abolition of serfdom in Russia, 1762-1907'' (2001) pp. 98–114&lt;/ref&gt; Even before emancipation in 1861, serfdom was on the wane in Russia. The proportion of serfs within the empire had gradually decreased "from 45-50 percent at the end of the eighteenth century, to 37.7 percent in 1858."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Russia Under the Old Regime: Second edition |page=163|author=Pipes, Richard|origyear=1974|year=1995|ISBN=978-0140247688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern Germany==
[[File:Unbekannter Meister 18-19 Jh Feiernde Bauern.jpg|thumb|"''Feiernde Bauern''" ("Celebrating Peasants"), artist unknown, 18th or 19th century]]
In Germany, peasants continued to center their lives in the village well into the 19th century. They belonged to a corporate body and helped to manage the community resources and to monitor community life.&lt;ref&gt;Eda Sagarra, ''A Social History of Germany: 1648-1914'' (1977) pp. 140-54&lt;/ref&gt; In the East they had the status of serfs bound permanently to parcels of land. A peasant is called a "Bauer" in German and "Bur" in [[Low German]] (pronounced in English like ''boor'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=English Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=127|year=1855|issue=8|pages=117-118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord—typically a nobleman.&lt;ref&gt;The monasteries of Bavaria, which controlled 56% of the land, were broken up by the government, and sold off around 1803. Thomas Nipperdey, ''Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800-1866'' (1996), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Inside the family the patriarch made all the decisions, and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages' communal life centered on church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscripts required by the army. The noblemen handled external relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily activities or decisions.&lt;ref&gt;For details on the life of a representative peasant farmer, who migrated in 1710 to Pennsylvania, see Bernd Kratz, he was a farmer, "Hans Stauffer: A Farmer in Germany before his Emigration to Pennsylvania," ''Genealogist,'' Fall 2008, Vol. 22 Issue 2, pp. 131-169&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th-century France==
In his seminal book ''Peasants into Frenchmen: the Modernization of Rural France, 1880–1914'' (1976), historian [[Eugen Weber]] traced the modernization of French villages and argued that rural France went from backward and isolated to modern and possessing a sense of French nationhood during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Amato, "Eugen Weber's France", ''Journal of Social History'', Vol. 25, 1992, pp. 879–882.&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized the roles of railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription. He based his findings on school records, migration patterns, military-service documents and economic trends. Weber argued that until 1900 or so a sense of French nationhood was weak in the provinces. Weber then looked at how the policies of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] created a sense of French nationality in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber, "The Second Republic, Politics, and the Peasant", ''French Historical Studies'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;11, No.&amp;nbsp;4 (Autumn, 1980), pp. 521–550 ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/286349 in JSTOR]).&lt;/ref&gt; The book was widely praised, but some&lt;ref&gt;Ted W. Margadant, "French Rural Society in the Nineteenth Century: A Review Essay", ''Agricultural History'', Summer 1979, Vol.&amp;nbsp;53 No.&amp;nbsp;3, pp. 644–651.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that a sense of Frenchness existed in the provinces before 1870.

==Use of the term for Chinese farmers==
{{See also|Agriculture in China}}

Farmers in [[China]] have been sometimes referred to as "peasants" in English-language sources. However, the traditional term for farmer, ''nongfu'' (农夫), simply refers to "farmer" or "agricultural worker". In the 19th century, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] intellectuals reinvented the Chinese terms ''fengjian'' (封建) for "feudalism" and ''nongmin'' (农民), or "farming people," terms used in the description of [[feudal Japan]]ese society.&lt;ref name="Myron Cohen 2005. p. 64"&gt;Myron Cohen, ''Kinship, Contract, Community, and State: Anthropological Perspectives on China.'' 2005. p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; These terms created a negative image of Chinese farmers by making a class distinction where one had not previously existed.&lt;ref name="Myron Cohen 2005. p. 64"/&gt; [[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] Myron Cohen considers these terms to be [[neologism]]s that represented a cultural and political invention. He writes:&lt;ref&gt;Myron Cohen, ''Kinship, Contract, Community, and State: Anthropological Perspectives on China.'' 2005. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This divide represented a radical departure from tradition: [[Frederick W. Mote|F.W. Mote]] and others have shown how especially during the later imperial era ([[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties), China was notable for the cultural, social, political, and economic interpenetration of city and countryside. But the term ''nongmin'' did enter China in association with [[Marxism|Marxist]] and non-Marxist [[Western world|Western]] perceptions of the "peasant," thereby putting the full weight of the Western heritage to use in a new and sometimes harshly negative representation of China's rural population. Likewise, with this development Westerners found it all the more "natural" to apply their own historically derived images of the peasant to what they observed or were told in China. The idea of the peasant remains powerfully entrenched in the Western perception of China to this very day.}}

Modern Western writers often continue to use the term ''peasant'' for Chinese farmers, typically without ever defining what the term means.&lt;ref&gt;Myron Cohen, ''Kinship, Contract, Community, and State: Anthropological Perspectives on China.'' 2005. p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; This Western use of the term suggests that China is stagnant, "medieval", underdeveloped, and held back by its rural population.&lt;ref&gt;Mei, Yi-tsi. ''Ideology, Power, Text: Self-Representation and the Peasant 'Other' in Modern Chinese Literature.'' 1998. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen writes that the "imposition of the historically burdened Western contrasts of town and country, shopkeeper and peasant, or merchant and landlord, serves only to distort the realities of the Chinese economic tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Myron Cohen, ''Kinship, Contract, Community, and State: Anthropological Perspectives on China.'' 2005. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bur in Jewish scripture==

A bur is presented by the [[Rambam]] (Maimonides) as a person having neither (ethical) torah education nor virtues of manners nor the ability to acquire them. [[Maimonides]] gives five definitions of Hebrew terms found in Jewish scripture, that discuss foolishness and wisdom, they are, in ascending order: '''bur''', [[am ha'aretz]], [[golem]], [[chacham]], and [[chasid]]. The definition of the Hebrew term ''bur'' is extracted by Maimonides from the phrase ''sedeh bur'',&lt;ref name=web-rambam-bur&gt;{{cite web|title=Shabbat Nahamu VI - Torah commentary - Pirke Abot: II:4 |url=http://www.betemunah.org/sederim/ellul2068.html |work= |publisher=Esnoga Bet Emunah 2008 |accessdate=19 May 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813173251/http://www.betemunah.org/sederim/ellul2068.html |archivedate=13 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chill-rambam-bur&gt;{{cite book|last=Chill|first=Abraham|title=Abrabanel on Pirke Avot = [Pirḳe avot, Naḥalat avot] : a digest of Rabbi Isaac Abrabanel's "Nahalat avot" with selections from other classical commentaries on Pirkei avot|year=1991|publisher=Sepher-Hermon Press|location=New York|isbn=0-87203-135-7|pages=109–113|author2=Chill, translated by Abraham}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates as an "uncultivated field".

==Historiography==
{{See also|Agrarianism}}
[[File:Peasants 3French Best.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait sculpture of 18th-century French peasants by artist [[George S. Stuart]], in the permanent collection of the Museum of Ventura County, [[Ventura, California|Ventura]], [[California]]]]

Since the literate classes have left the most records, and these tended to dismiss peasants as figures of coarse appetite and rustic comedy, the term "peasant" may have a pejorative rather than descriptive connotation in historical memory. Society was theorized as being organized into three "estates": those who work, those who pray, and those who fight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Southern]]: ''The Making of the Middle Ages'' (1952)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Annales School]] of French historians emphasized the importance of peasants. Its leader [[Fernand Braudel]] devoted the first volume—called ''The Structures of Everyday Life''—of his major work, ''Civilization and Capitalism 15th–18th Century'' to the largely silent and invisible world that existed below the market economy.

Other research in the field of peasant studies was promoted by [[Florian Znaniecki]] and [[Fei Xiaotong]], and in the post-1945 studies of the "great tradition" and the "little tradition" in the work of [[Robert Redfield]]. In the 1960s, anthropologists and historians began to rethink the role of [[peasant revolt]] in world history and in their own disciplines. Peasant revolution was seen as a [[Third World]] response to capitalism and imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=Eric R.|authorlink1=Eric Wolf|title=Peasants|date=1965|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|isbn=978-0136554561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]], for instance, drew on the work of earlier scholars in the Marxist tradition such as [[Daniel Thorner]], who saw the rural population as a key element in the [[transition from feudalism to capitalism]]. Wolf and a group of scholars{{who|date=January 2011}} criticized both Marx and the field of [[Modernization|modernization theorists]] for treating peasants as lacking [[agency (sociology)|the ability to take action]].&lt;ref&gt;
Eric R. Wolf, Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century (New York,: Harper &amp; Row, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; [[James C. Scott]]'s field observations in Malaysia convinced him that villagers were active participants in their local politics even though they were forced to use indirect methods. Many of these activist scholars looked back to the [[peasant movement]] in India and to the theories of the revolution in China led by [[Mao Zedong]] starting in the 1920s. The anthropologist Myron Cohen, however, asked why the rural population in China were called "peasants" rather than "farmers", a distinction he called political rather than scientific.&lt;ref&gt;Myron Cohen, "Cultural and Political Inventions in Modern China: The Case of the Chinese 'Peasant'", ''[[Daedalus (journal)|Daedalus]]'' 122.2 (Spring 1993): 151-170.&lt;/ref&gt; One important outlet for their scholarly work and theory was the ''[[Journal of Peasant Studies]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="109207">'''Power-to-weight ratio''' (or '''specific power''' or '''power-to-mass ratio''') is a calculation commonly applied to [[engine]]s and mobile power sources to enable the comparison of one unit or design to another. Power-to-weight ratio is a measurement of actual performance of any engine or power source. It is also used as a measurement of performance of a [[vehicle]] as a whole, with the [[Engine power|engine's power output]] being divided by the weight (or [[mass]]) of the vehicle, to give a metric that is independent of the vehicle's size. Power-to-weight is often quoted by manufacturers at the peak value, but the actual value may vary in use and variations will affect performance.

The inverse of power-to-weight, weight-to-power ratio (power loading) is a calculation commonly applied to aircraft, cars, and vehicles in general, to enable the comparison of one vehicle's performance to another. Power-to-weight ratio is equal to thrust per unit mass multiplied by the velocity of any vehicle.

==Power-to-weight (specific power)==

The power-to-weight ratio (Specific Power) formula for an engine (power plant) is the [[power (physics)|power]] generated by the engine divided by the mass. ("Weight" in this context is a colloquial term for "mass". To see this, note that what an engineer means by the "power to weight ratio" of an electric motor is not infinite in a zero gravity environment.)

A typical turbocharged V8 diesel engine might have an engine power of {{convert|250|kW|abbr=on}} and a mass of {{convert|380|kg|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="gmduramax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eogld.ecomm.gm.com/images/mediumduty/techspecs/engine.pdf|title=General Motors 2009 Data Book|date=September 5, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102194334/http://eogld.ecomm.gm.com/images/mediumduty/techspecs/engine.pdf|archivedate=November 2, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 0.65&amp;nbsp;kW/kg&amp;nbsp;(0.40&amp;nbsp;hp/lb).

Examples of high power-to-weight ratios can often be found in turbines. This is because of their ability to operate at very high speeds. For example, the [[Space Shuttle]]'s main engines used [[turbopump]]s (machines consisting of a pump driven by a turbine engine) to feed the propellants (liquid oxygen and [[liquid hydrogen]]) into the engine's combustion chamber. The original liquid hydrogen turbopump is similar in size to an automobile engine (weighing approximately {{convert|775|lb|kg|order=flip}}) and produces 72,000 [[horsepower|hp]] (53.6 [[megawatt|MW]])&lt;ref name="ssmetpb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090004620_2008048278.pdf|publisher=[[NASA]]|title=Lessons in Systems Engineering - The SSME Weight Growth History|first=Richard|last=Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a power-to-weight ratio of 153&amp;nbsp;kW/kg&amp;nbsp;(93&amp;nbsp;hp/lb).

===Physical interpretation===

In [[classical mechanics]], instantaneous [[Power (physics)|power]] is the limiting value of the average work done per unit time as the time interval Δ''t'' approaches zero.
:&lt;math&gt;
P = \lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} \tfrac{\Delta W(t)}{\Delta t} = \lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} P_\mathrm{avg}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The typically used metrical unit of the power-to-weight ratio is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{W}{kg}\;&lt;/math&gt; which equals &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{m^2}{s^3}\;&lt;/math&gt;. This fact allows one to express the power-to-weight ratio purely by [[SI base unit]]s.

====Propulsive power====

If the work to be done is [[wikt:rectilinear|rectilinear]] motion of a body with constant [[mass]] &lt;math&gt;m\;&lt;/math&gt;, whose [[center of mass]] is to be accelerated along a [[Euclidean vector|straight line]] to a speed &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{v}(t)|\;&lt;/math&gt; and angle &lt;math&gt;\phi\;&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the centre and [[Spherical coordinate system|radial]] of a [[gravitational field]] by an onboard [[powertrain|powerplant]], then the associated [[kinetic energy]] to be delivered to the body is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; E_K =\tfrac{1}{2} m|\mathbf{v}(t)|^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;m\;&lt;/math&gt; is mass of the body
:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{v}(t)|\;&lt;/math&gt; is speed of the [[center of mass]] of the body, changing with time.

The instantaneous mechanical pushing/pulling power delivered to the body from the powerplant is then

:&lt;math&gt; P_K =\tfrac{1}{2} m 2|\mathbf{v}(t)| \lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} \tfrac{\Delta |\mathbf{v}(t)|}{\Delta t} =  m \mathbf{a}(t) \cdot \mathbf{v}(t) = \mathbf{F}(t) \cdot \mathbf{v}(t) = \mathbf{\tau}(t) \cdot \mathbf{\omega}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}(t)\;&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration of the [[center of mass]] of the body, changing with time.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(t)\;&lt;/math&gt; is linear force – or thrust – applied upon the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(t)\;&lt;/math&gt; is [[velocity]] of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau}(t)\;&lt;/math&gt; is [[torque]] applied upon the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}(t)\;&lt;/math&gt; is [[angular velocity]] of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.

In propulsion, power is only delivered if the powerplant is in motion, and is transmitted to cause the body to be in motion. It is typically assumed here that mechanical transmission allows the powerplant to operate at peak output power. This assumption allows engine tuning to trade [[power band]] width and engine mass for transmission complexity and mass. [[Electric motor]]s do not suffer from this tradeoff, instead trading their high [[torque]] for [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] at low speed. The '''[[Mechanical advantage|power advantage]]''' or '''power-to-weight ratio''' is then

:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{P-to-W} = \frac{|\mathbf{a}(t)||\mathbf{v}(t)|}{|\mathbf{g}|}\;&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{v}(t)|\;&lt;/math&gt; is linear speed of the [[center of mass]] of the body.

====Engine power====

The actual useful power of any traction engine can be calculated using a [[dynamometer]] to measure [[torque]] and [[rotational speed]], with peak power sustained when the transmission and/or operator keeps the [[dot product|product]] of torque and rotational speed maximised. For jet engines there is e be usefully calculated there, for rockets there is typically no cruise speed, so it is less meaningful.

Peak power of a traction engine occurs at a rotational speed higher than the speed when torque is maximised and at or below the maximum rated rotational speed – Max RPM. A rapidly falling torque curve would correspond with sharp torque and power curve peaks around their maxima at similar rotational speed, for example a small, lightweight engine with a large turbocharger. A slowly falling or near flat torque curve would correspond with a slowly rising power curve up to a maximum at a rotational speed close to Max RPM, for example a large, heavy multi-cylinder engine suitable for cargo/hauling. A falling torque curve could correspond with a near flat power curve across rotational speeds for smooth handling at different vehicle speeds, such as a traction electric motor.

==Examples==

===Engines===

====Heat engines and heat pumps====
Thermal energy is made up from [[Sensible heat|molecular]] [[kinetic energy]] and [[Latent heat|latent]] [[Phase (matter)|phase]] energy. [[Heat engine]]s are able to convert thermal energy in the form of a temperature gradient between a hot source and a cold sink into other desirable [[Work (physics)|mechanical work]]. [[Heat pump]]s take [[Work (physics)|mechanical work]] to regenerate thermal energy in a temperature gradient. Care should be made when interpreting propulsive power, especially for jet engines and rockets, deliverable from heat engines to a vehicle.

===Electrochemical (galvanic) and electrostatic cell systems===

====(Closed cell) batteries====
All electrochemical cell batteries deliver a changing voltage as their chemistry changes from "charged" to "discharged". A nominal output voltage and a cutoff voltage are typically specified for a battery by its manufacturer. The output voltage falls to the cutoff voltage when the battery becomes "discharged". The nominal output voltage is always less than the open-circuit voltage produced when the battery is "charged". The temperature of a battery can affect the power it can deliver, where lower temperatures reduce power. Total energy delivered from a single charge cycle is affected by both the battery temperature and the power it delivers. If the temperature lowers or the power demand increases, the total energy delivered at the point of "discharge" is also reduced.

Battery discharge profiles are often described in terms of a factor of [[Battery (electricity)#Capacity and discharging|battery capacity]]. For example, a battery with a nominal capacity quoted in ampere-hours (Ah) at a C/10 rated discharge current (derived in amperes) may safely provide a higher discharge current – and therefore higher power-to-weight ratio – but only with a lower energy capacity. Power-to-weight ratio for batteries is therefore less meaningful without reference to corresponding energy-to-weight ratio and cell temperature. This relationship is known as [[Peukert's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peukert|first=W.|title=Über die Abhängigkeit der Kapazität von der Entladestromstärke bei Bleiakkumulatoren|journal=Elektrotechnische Zeitschrift|volume=20|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrostatic, electrolytic and electrochemical capacitors====
[[Capacitor]]s store electric charge onto two electrodes separated by an electric field semi-insulating ([[dielectric]]) medium. Electrostatic capacitors feature planar electrodes onto which electric charge accumulates. [[Electrolytic capacitor]]s use a liquid electrolyte as one of the electrodes and the [[Double layer (interfacial)|electric double layer effect]] upon the surface of the dielectric-electrolyte boundary to increase the amount of charge stored per unit volume. [[Electric double-layer capacitor]]s extend both electrodes with a [[Nanopore|nanopourous]] material such as [[activated carbon]] to significantly increase the surface area upon which electric charge can accumulate, reducing the dielectric medium to nanopores and a very thin high [[permittivity]] separator.

While capacitors tend not to be as temperature sensitive as batteries, they are significantly capacity constrained and without the strength of chemical bonds suffer from self-discharge. Power-to-weight ratio of capacitors is usually higher than batteries because charge transport units within the cell are smaller (electrons rather than ions), however energy-to-weight ratio is conversely usually lower.

====Fuel cell stacks and flow cell batteries====
[[Fuel cell]]s and [[Flow battery|flow cells]], although perhaps using similar chemistry to batteries, have the distinction of not containing the energy storage medium or [[fuel]]. With a continuous flow of fuel and oxidant, available fuel cells and flow cells continue to convert the energy storage medium into electric energy and waste products. Fuel cells distinctly contain a fixed electrolyte whereas flow cells also require a continuous flow of electrolyte. Flow cells typically have the fuel dissolved in the electrolyte.

===Vehicles===
Power-to-weight ratios for vehicles are usually calculated using [[curb weight]] (for cars) or wet weight (for motorcycles), that is, excluding weight of the driver and any cargo. This could be slightly misleading, especially with regard to motorcycles, where the driver might weigh 1/3 to 1/2 as much as the vehicle itself. In the sport of competitive cycling athlete's performance is increasingly being expressed in [[VAM (bicycling)|VAM]]s and thus as a power-to-weight ratio in W/kg. This can be measured through the use of a bicycle powermeter or calculated from measuring incline of a road climb and the rider's time to ascend it.&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingfitness.net/what-is-vam-and-how-to-calculate-it/|title=What is VAM and How to Calculate it?|accessdate=2010-06-25|date=2009-07-24|publisher=Cycling Fitness|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012184203/http://www.cyclingfitness.net/what-is-vam-and-how-to-calculate-it/|archivedate=2009-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Utility and practical vehicles====
Most vehicles are designed to meet passenger comfort and cargo carrying requirements. Different designs trade off power-to-weight ratio to increase comfort, cargo space, [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], [[Automobile emissions control|emissions control]], [[energy security]] and endurance. [[Automotive aerodynamics|Reduced drag]] and [[Low-rolling resistance tyres|lower rolling resistance]] in a vehicle design can facilitate increased cargo space without increase in the (zero cargo) power-to-weight ratio. This increases the role flexibility of the vehicle. Energy security considerations can trade off power (typically decreased) and weight (typically increased), and therefore power-to-weight ratio, for [[Flexible fuel vehicle|fuel flexibility]] or [[Hybrid vehicle|drive-train hybridisation]]. Some utility and practical vehicle variants such as [[hot hatch]]es and [[SUV|sports-utility vehicles]] reconfigure power (typically increased) and weight to provide the perception of [[sports car]] like performance or for other [[Criticism of sport utility vehicles|psychological benefit]].

A [[locomotive]] generally must be very heavy in order to develop enough [[adhesion railway|adhesion on the rails]] to start a train.  As the [[coefficient of friction]] between steel wheels and rails seldom exceeds 0.25 in most cases, improving a locomotive's power-to-weight ratio is often counterproductive. However, the choice of power transmission system, such as [[variable-frequency drive]] versus [[dc motor|direct current drive]], may support a higher power-to-weight ratio by better managing propulsion power.

=====Performance luxury, roadsters and mild sports=====
Increased engine performance is a consideration, but also other features associated with [[luxury vehicle]]s. [[Longitudinal engine]]s are common. Bodies vary from [[hot hatch]]es, [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans (saloons)]], [[coupé]]s, [[Convertible (car)|convertibles]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]]. Mid-range [[Dual-sport motorcycle|dual-sport]] and [[Cruiser (motorcycle)|cruiser]] motorcycles tend to have similar power-to-weight ratios.

Power to weight ratio is important in cycling, since it determines acceleration and the speed during hill climbs. Since a cyclist's power to weight output decreases with fatigue, it is normally discussed with relation to the length of time that he or she maintains that power. A professional cyclist can produce over 20 W/kg as a 5-second maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.trainingpeaks.com/blog/article/power-profiling|title=Power Profiling - TrainingPeaks|date=10 October 2008|publisher=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A 225-pound touring cyclist coasting down an exhilarating 10-degree mountain slope at 35 miles per hour rates 62 pounds per horsepower. The calculation is demonstrative and does not imply terminal speed. The power figure is 3.6 horsepower. In ISO units, this is 27 W/kg. In 60 seconds of such coasting, therefore, 39 kcal are lost, or 45 watt-hours. Climbing is the major impediment to progress on road when cycling.

[[Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|250px|The elements of the power set of the set {''x'', ''y'', ''z''}  [[order theory|ordered]] with respect to [[Inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]].]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''power set''' (or '''powerset''') of any [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|''S''}} is the set of all [[subset]]s of {{mvar|''S''}}, including the [[empty set]] and {{mvar|S}} itself, variously denoted as {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}), 𝒫({{mvar|''S''}}), ℘({{mvar|''S''}}) (using the "[[Weierstrass p]]"), {{math|''P''(''S'')}}, {{math|ℙ(''S'')}}, or, identifying the powerset of {{mvar|''S''}} with the set of all functions from {{mvar|''S''}} to a given set of two elements, {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In [[axiomatic set theory]] (as developed, for example, in the [[ZFC]] axioms), the existence of the power set of any set is [[postulated]] by the [[axiom of power set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1979|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any subset of {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}) is called a ''[[family of sets]]'' over {{mvar|''S''}}.

==Example==
If {{mvar|S}} is the set {{math|{{mset|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}}}, then the subsets of {{mvar|S}} are

* {{math|{{mset}}}} (also denoted &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;, the  [[empty set]] or the null set)
* {{math|{{mset|''x''}}}}
* {{math|{{mset|''y''}}}}
* {{math|{{mset|''z''}}}}
* {{math|{{mset|''x'', ''y''}}}}
* {{math|{{mset|''x'', ''z''}}}}
* {{math|{{mset|''y'', ''z''}}}}
* {{math|{{mset|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}}}
and hence the power set of {{mvar|S}} is {{math|{{mset|{{mset}},
{{mset|''x''}},
{{mset|''y''}},
{{mset|''z''}},
{{mset|''x'', ''y''}},
{{mset|''x'', ''z''}},
{{mset|''y'', ''z''}},
{{mset|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puntambekar|2007|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
If {{mvar|''S''}} is a finite set with {{math|1={{!}}''S''{{!}} = ''n''}} elements, then the number of subsets of {{mvar|''S''}} is {{math|1={{!}}{{mathcal|P}}(''S''){{!}} = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This fact, which is the motivation for the notation {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, may be demonstrated simply as follows,
: First, order the elements of {{mvar|S}} in any manner. We write any subset of {{mvar|''S''}} in the format {{math|{γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; }}} where {{math|γ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; , 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}}, can take the value of {{math|0}} or {{math|1}}. If {{math|1=γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}, the {{mvar|i}}-th element of {{mvar|''S''}} is in the subset; otherwise, the {{mvar|i}}-th element is not in the subset. Clearly the number of distinct subsets that can be constructed this way is {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} as {{math|γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ {0, 1} }}.

[[Cantor's diagonal argument#General sets|Cantor's diagonal argument]] shows that the power set of a set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher [[cardinality]] than the set itself (informally the power set must be larger than the original set). In particular, [[Cantor's theorem]] shows that the power set of a [[countable set|countably infinite]] set is [[uncountable|uncountably]] infinite. The power set of the set of [[natural number]]s can be put in a [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] with the set of [[real number]]s (see [[Cardinality of the continuum]]).

The power set of a set {{mvar|''S''}}, together with the operations of [[union (set theory)|union]], [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[complement (set theory)|complement]] can be viewed as the prototypical example of a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. In fact, one can show that any ''finite'' Boolean algebra is [[isomorphic]] to the Boolean algebra of the power set of a finite set. For ''infinite'' Boolean algebras this is no longer true, but every infinite Boolean algebra can be represented as a [[subalgebra]] of a power set Boolean algebra (see [[Stone's representation theorem]]).

The power set of a set {{mvar|''S''}} forms an [[abelian group]] when considered with the operation of [[symmetric difference]] (with the empty set as the identity element and each set being its own inverse) and a [[commutative]] [[monoid]] when considered with the operation of intersection. It can hence be shown (by proving the [[Distributive property|distributive laws]]) that the power set considered together with both of these operations forms a [[Boolean ring]].

==Representing subsets as functions== &lt;!-- this section is referenced forme some other place in this article, do not change its title carelessly --&gt;
In set theory, [[Function (mathematics)#Function space|{{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] is the set of all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from {{mvar|Y}} to {{mvar|X}}.  As "2" can be defined as {{math|{{mset|0,1}}}} (see [[Natural number#A standard construction|natural number]]), {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} (i.e., {{math|{{mset|0,1}}&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is the set of all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from {{mvar|''S''}} to {0,1}.  By identifying a function in {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with the corresponding [[preimage]] of {{math|1}}, we see that there is a [[bijection]] between {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}), where each function is the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the subset in {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}) with which it is identified.  Hence {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}) could be considered identical set-theoretically.  (Thus there are two distinct [[set notation#Metaphor in denoting sets|notational motivations]] for denoting the power set by {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}}:  the fact that this function-representation of subsets makes it a special case of the {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt;}} notation and the property, [[power set#Properties|mentioned above]], that {{math|1={{abs|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} = 2&lt;sup&gt;{{abs|''S''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}.)

This notion can be applied to the example [[Power set#Example|above]] in which {{math|1=''S'' = {{mset|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}}} to see the isomorphism with the binary numbers
from 0 to {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} with {{mvar|n}} being the number of elements in the set.
In {{mvar|''S''}}, a "1" in the position corresponding to the location in the enumerated set {{math|1={{mset| (''x'', 0), (''y'', 1), (''z'', 2) }}}} indicates the presence of the element. So {{math|1={{mset|''x'', ''y''}} = 011&lt;sub&gt;(2)&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

For the whole power set of {{mvar|''S''}} we get:

Such bijective mapping of ''S'' to integers is arbitrary, so this representation of subsets of ''S'' is not unique, but the sort order of the enumerated set does not change its cardinality.

However, such finite binary representation is only possible if ''S'' can be enumerated (this is possible even if ''S'' has an infinite cardinality, such as the set of integers or rationals, but not for example if ''S'' is the set of real numbers, in which we cannot enumerate all irrational numbers to assign them a defined finite location in an ordered set containing all irrational numbers).

==Relation to binomial theorem==
The power set is closely related to the [[binomial theorem]].  The number of subsets with {{mvar|k}} elements in the power set of a set with {{mvar|n}} elements is given by the number of [[combination]]s, {{math|C(''n'', ''k'')}}, also called [[binomial coefficient]]s.

For example, the power set of a set with three elements, has:

*C(3, 0) = 1 subset with 0 elements (the empty subset),
*C(3, 1) = 3 subsets with 1 element (the singleton subsets),
*C(3, 2) = 3 subsets with 2 elements (the complements of the singleton subsets),
*C(3, 3) = 1 subset with 3 elements (the original set itself).


Using this relationship we can compute &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left|2^S \right|&lt;/math&gt; using the formula:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\left|2^S \right | = \sum_{k=0}^{|S|} \binom{|S|}{k} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore one can deduce the following identity, assuming &lt;math display="inline"&gt;|S| = n&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\left |2^S \right| = 2^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} &lt;/math&gt;

==Algorithms==
If {{mvar|S}} is a [[finite set]], there is a [[recursive algorithm]] to calculate {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}).

Define the operation {{math|1={{mathcal|F}} (''e'', ''T'') = {''X'' ∪ {''e''} {{!}} ''X'' ∈ ''T''}}}.

In English, return the set with the element {{mvar|e}} added to each set {{mvar|X}} in {{mvar|T}}.

*If {{math|1=''S'' = { } }}, then {{math|1={{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}) = { { } } }} is returned.
*Otherwise:
:*Let {{mvar|e}} be any single element of {{mvar|S}}.
:*Let {{math|1=''T'' = ''S'' \ {''e''} }}, where {{math|''S'' \ {''e''} }} denotes the [[Complement (set theory)|relative complement]] of {{mvar|e}} in {{mvar|S}}.
:*And the result: {{math|1={{mathcal|P}}(''S'') = {{mathcal|P}}(''T'') ∪ {{mathcal|F}} (''e'', {{mathcal|P}}(''T''))}} is returned.

In other words, the power set of the empty set is the set containing the empty set and the power set of any other set is all the subsets of the set containing some specific element and all the subsets of the set not containing that specific element.

==Subsets of limited cardinality==
The set of subsets of {{mvar|''S''}} of [[cardinality]] less than or equal to {{math|κ}} is sometimes denoted by {{math|{{mathcal|P}}&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}} or {{math|[''S'']&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and the set of subsets with cardinality strictly less than {{math|κ}} is sometimes denoted {{math|{{mathcal|P}}&lt;sub&gt;&lt; κ&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}} or {{math|[''S'']&lt;sup&gt;&lt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Similarly, the set of non-empty subsets of {{mvar|''S''}} might be denoted by {{math|{{mathcal|P}}&lt;sub&gt;≥ 1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}} or {{math|{{mathcal|P}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''S'')}}.

==Power object==
A set can be regarded as an algebra having no nontrivial operations or defining equations.  From this perspective the idea of the power set of {{mvar|''X''}} as the set of subsets of {{mvar|''X''}} generalizes naturally to the subalgebras of an [[algebraic structure]] or algebra.

Now the power set of a set, when ordered by inclusion, is always a complete atomic Boolean algebra, and every complete atomic Boolean algebra arises as the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] of all subsets of some set.  The generalization to arbitrary algebras is that the set of subalgebras of an algebra, again ordered by inclusion, is always an [[algebraic lattice]], and every algebraic lattice arises as the lattice of subalgebras of some algebra.  So in that regard subalgebras behave analogously to subsets.

However, there are two important properties of subsets that do not carry over to subalgebras in general.  First, although the subsets of a set form a set (as well as a lattice), in some classes it may not be possible to organize the subalgebras of an algebra as itself an algebra in that class, although they can always be organized as a lattice.  Secondly, whereas the subsets of a set are in bijection with the functions from that set to the set {0,1} = 2, there is no guarantee that a class of algebras contains an algebra that can play the role of 2 in this way.

Certain classes of algebras enjoy both of these properties.  The first property is more common, the case of having both is relatively rare.  One class that does have both is that of [[multigraph]]s.  Given two multigraphs {{mvar|''G''}} and {{mvar|''H''}}, a [[homomorphism]] {{math|''h'': ''G'' → ''H''}} consists of two functions, one mapping vertices to vertices and the other mapping edges to edges.  The set {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of homomorphisms from {{mvar|''G''}} to {{mvar|''H''}} can then be organized as the graph whose vertices and edges are respectively the vertex and edge functions appearing in that set.  Furthermore, the subgraphs of a multigraph {{mvar|''G''}} are in bijection with the graph homomorphisms from {{mvar|''G''}} to the multigraph {{math|Ω}} definable as the [[complete graph|complete directed graph]] on two vertices (hence four edges, namely two self-loops and two more edges forming a cycle) augmented with a fifth edge, namely a second self-loop at one of the vertices.  We can therefore organize the subgraphs of {{mvar|''G''}} as the multigraph {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, called the '''power object''' of {{mvar|''G''}}.

What is special about a multigraph as an algebra is that its operations are unary.  A multigraph has two sorts of elements forming a set {{mvar|''V''}} of vertices and {{mvar|''E''}} of edges, and has two unary operations {{math|''s'',''t'': ''E'' → ''V''}} giving the source (start) and target (end) vertices of each edge.  An algebra all of whose operations are unary is called a [[presheaf]].  Every class of presheaves contains a presheaf {{math|Ω}} that plays the role for subalgebras that 2 plays for subsets.  Such a class is a special case of the more general notion of elementary [[topos]] as a [[category (mathematics)|category]] that is [[closed category|closed]] (and moreover [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]) and has an object {{math|Ω}}, called a [[subobject classifier]].  Although the term "power object" is sometimes used synonymously with [[exponential object]] {{math|''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, in topos theory {{mvar|''Y''}} is required to be {{math|Ω}}.

==Functors and quantifiers==
In [[category theory]] and the theory of [[elementary topos|elementary topoi]], the [[universal quantifier]] can be understood as the [[right adjoint]] of a [[functor]] between power sets, the [[inverse image]] functor of a function between sets; likewise, the [[existential quantifier]] is the [[left adjoint]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Saunders Mac Lane]], [[Ieke Moerdijk]], (1992) ''Sheaves in Geometry and Logic'' Springer-Verlag. {{isbn|0-387-97710-4}} ''See page 58''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5826">This article contains proof of [[List of formulas in Riemannian geometry|formulas in Riemannian geometry]] that involve the [[Christoffel symbols]].

==Contracted Bianchi identities==

===Proof===
Start with the [[Curvature form#Bianchi identities|Bianchi identity]]&lt;ref name="syngeandschild"&gt;{{cite book |author=Synge J.L., Schild A.|title=Tensor Calculus|year=  1949|pages=87–89-90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_{abmn;\ell} + R_{ab\ell m;n} + R_{abn\ell;m} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!-- The symbols \,\! exist to force PNG rendering; do not remove them. --&gt;

[[Tensor contraction|Contract]] both sides of the above equation with a pair of [[metric tensor]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;  g^{bn} g^{am} (R_{abmn;\ell} + R_{ab\ell m;n} + R_{abn\ell;m}) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; g^{bn} (R^m {}_{bmn;\ell} - R^m {}_{bm\ell;n} + R^m {}_{bn\ell;m}) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; g^{bn} (R_{bn;\ell} - R_{b\ell;n} - R_b {}^m {}_{n\ell;m}) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R^n {}_{n;\ell} - R^n {}_{\ell;n} - R^{nm} {}_{n\ell;m} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The first term on the left contracts to yield a Ricci scalar, while the third term contracts to yield a [[mixed tensor|mixed]] Ricci tensor,
:&lt;math&gt; R_{;\ell} - R^n {}_{\ell;n} - R^m {}_{\ell;m} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The last two terms are the same (changing dummy index ''n'' to ''m'') and can be combined into a single term which shall be moved to the right,
:&lt;math&gt; R_{;\ell} = 2 R^m {}_{\ell;m},&lt;/math&gt;
which is the same as
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_m R^m {}_\ell = {1 \over 2} \nabla_\ell R.&lt;/math&gt;
Swapping the index labels ''l'' and ''m'' yields
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\ell R^\ell {}_m = {1 \over 2} \nabla_m R,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''[[Q.E.D.]]'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''[[Riemannian geometry cheat sheet#Ricci and scalar curvatures|return to article]]'')

==The covariant divergence of the Einstein tensor vanishes==

===Proof===
The last equation in the proof above can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\ell R^\ell {}_m - {1 \over 2} \delta^\ell {}_m \nabla_\ell R = 0&lt;/math&gt;
where δ is the [[Kronecker delta]].  Since the mixed Kronecker delta is equivalent to the mixed metric tensor,
:&lt;math&gt; \delta^\ell {}_m = g^\ell {}_m,&lt;/math&gt;
and since the [[covariant derivative]] of the metric tensor is zero (so it can be moved in or out of the scope of any such derivative), then
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\ell R^\ell {}_m - {1 \over 2} \nabla_\ell g^\ell {}_m R = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Factor out the covariant derivative
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\ell\left(R^\ell {}_m - {1 \over 2} g^\ell {}_m R\right) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
then raise the index ''m'' throughout
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\ell \left(R^{\ell m} - {1 \over 2} g^{\ell m} R\right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The expression in parentheses is the [[Einstein tensor]], so &lt;ref name="syngeandschild" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\ell G^{\ell m} = 0,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[Q.E.D.]]'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(''[[Riemannian geometry cheat sheet#Einstein tensor|return to article]]'')

this means that the covariant divergence of the Einstein tensor vanishes.

==The Lie derivative of the metric==

===Proof===
Starting with the local [[coordinate]] formula for a covariant symmetric tensor field &lt;math&gt;g=g_{ab}(x^c)dx^a\otimes dx^b&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Lie derivative]] along a [[vector field]] &lt;math&gt;X = X^a \partial_a&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_X g_{ab} &amp; = X^c \partial_c g_{ab}+g_{cb}\partial_a X^c + g_{ca}\partial_b X^c \\ &amp; = X^c \partial_c g_{ab} + g_{cb}\bigl(\partial_a X^c\pm \Gamma^{c}_{da}X^d\bigr) + g_{ca}\bigl(\partial_b X^c \pm \Gamma^{c}_{db}X^d\bigr) \\ &amp; = \bigl( X^c \partial_c g_{ab} - g_{cb}\Gamma^{c}_{da}X^d - g_{ca}\Gamma^{c}_{db}X^d\bigr)+ \bigl[  g_{cb}\bigl(\partial_a X^c + \Gamma^{c}_{da}X^d\bigr) + g_{ca}\bigl(\partial_b X^c + \Gamma^{c}_{db}X^d\bigr) \bigr] \\ &amp; = X^c\nabla_c g_{ab} + g_{cb}\nabla_a X^c + g_{ca}\nabla_b X^c \\ &amp; = 0 + g_{cb}\nabla_a X^c + g_{ca}\nabla_b X^c \\ &amp; = g_{cb}\nabla_a X^c + g_{ca}\nabla_b X^c \\ &amp; = \nabla_a X_b + \nabla_b X_a
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
here, the notation &lt;math&gt;\partial_a = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^a}&lt;/math&gt; means taking the [[partial derivative]] with respect to the coordinate &lt;math&gt; x^a&lt;/math&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''[[Q.E.D.]]'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''[[Riemannian geometry cheat sheet#Ricci and scalar curvatures|return to article]]'')

A '''punch''' is a [[strike (attack)|striking]] blow with the fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/punch |title=Punch &amp;#124; Define Punch at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in most [[martial art]]s and [[combat sport]]s, most notably [[Boxing]], where it is the only type of offensive technique allowed. In sports, [[hand wrap]]s or other padding such as gloves may be used to protect athletes and practitioners from injuring themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Ringside.com | url = http://www.ringside.com/WrapYourHands.aspx | title = The Proper Way to Wrap Your Hands | accessdate = 2007-07-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070426032249/http://www.ringside.com/WrapYourHands.aspx &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, Willie L. "[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5295269.html Portable Hand Wrap]" Mar 22. 1994. Retrieved on June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of punches varies between different martial arts and combat sports. Styles such as Boxing, [[Suntukan]] or [[Russian fist fighting]] use punches alone, while others such as [[Kickboxing]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Lethwei]] or [[Karate]] may use both punches and [[kick]]s. Others such as [[wrestling]] and [[judo]] (punches and other striking techniques, [[atemi]], are present in judo kata, but are forbidden in competitions) do not use punches at all. There are many types of punches and as a result, different styles encompass varying types of punching techniques.

|Backfist
|A backfist is performed by forming a fist and striking with the backside of the fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oyama|first=Masutatsu|title=Mas Oyama's Classic Karate|year=2004|publisher=Sterling; Chrysalis (distributor)|location=New York: London|isbn=1-4027-1287-1|others=Translated by Tomoko Murakami|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''spinning backfist'' is performed when the attacker swivels 360 degrees before landing the punch, adding extra momentum to the attack. The fighter will lunge and begin spinning toward the side of the opponent of which fist he or she will attack with. Simpler terms, go to the left, spin to the left and connect with the left fist and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifafitness.com/kickbox/upper/backfist.htm |title=IFA Kickboxing Library |at=Spinning Backfist |website=International Fitness Association |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629174843/http://www.ifafitness.com/kickbox/upper/backfist.htm |archive-date=2016-06-29 |dead-url=yes |first=Tony |last=Carr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|Chambered Punch
|A strike commonly performed in karate, kung fu, and tae kwon do, originating from a "chambered" position.
|-
|[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]] or straight
|A direct straight punch similar to the jab, except delivered with the rear hand. Power is generated through the rotation of the hips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scully|first=John|title=Learn To Box|url=http://www.saddoboxing.com/learn.html|publisher=Saddo Boxing|accessdate=25 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68h3dmJIF|archivedate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference between a cross and a straight punch|url=http://heavyfists.com/right-cross-straight-right-difference|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Jab]]
|The jab is a straight blow delivered (generally from a distance) with the arm above the lead foot ... The punch is quick and explosive. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist. " It is generally used for distraction, keeping distance, setting up, and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jab Punch|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/art-71117|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=29 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013145009/http://www.britannica.com/eb/art-71117/Jab-The-jab-is-a-straight-blow-delivered-with-the|archivedate=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jab punch|url=http://www.all-karate.com/140/jab-punch-kizami-zuki|publisher=All-Karate.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Leopard Blow|Long Fist]]
|By tucking the fingertips against the bottom knuckle of each finger, a long fist is formed. They offer decreased strength but increased reach. The striking surface is also narrower, which allows the fist to dig between ribs and other soft target areas.
|-
|[[Hammer Fist]]
|A compacted fist is brought down upon the target, usually using the outside area of the fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oyama|first=Masutatsu|title=Mas Oyama's Classic Karate|year=2004|publisher=Sterling; Chrysalis (distributor)|location=New York: London|isbn=1-4027-1287-1|others=Translated by Tomoko Murakami|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|Haymaker
|A punch in which the arm is whipped sideways from the shoulder joint with minimal elbow bend. The name is derived from the motion, which mimics the action of manually cutting hay by swinging a [[scythe]]. The haymaker is considered an imperfect/impure punch, as the angle of approach is unsupported by the remainder of the forearm. Since a haymaker's power is derived completely from weight transfer and momentum instead of muscle contraction, a long windup is required to generate sufficient force. Haymakers, in the form of shoulder punches, are frequently used from a [[Mount (grappling)|mounted position]] in [[mixed martial arts]] as part of the "[[ground and pound]]" method, as the legs cannot be used to generate power. When thrown from standing, these punches leave the person vulnerable to a counter punch during the wind up, if blocked, or if the haymaker misses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mongold|first=Brian|title=How to Throw a Punch|url=http://www.eazycheezy.net/2010/04/how-to-throw-a-punch-by-guest-author-the-wolf.html|publisher=Eazycheezy.net|accessdate=25 June 2012|author2=The Wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]
|A punch involving the use of turning to aim toward the side of the head or body. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hook Punch Technique|url=http://www.physical-arts.com/training/techniques/mn_hook_punch.html|publisher=Physical-Arts.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Drop (boxing)|Overhand]]
|A semi-circular and vertical punch thrown with the rear hand. It is usually when the opponent is [[Bobbing (boxing)|bobbing]] or [[slipping]]. The strategic utility of the drop relying on body weight can deliver a great deal of power. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist.
|-
|Shovel Hook
|A close range punch that is halfway between a hook and an uppercut. Shovel hooks are most commonly used to strike the body at a 45 degree angle. For example, a liver shot can be done using a shovel hook. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shovel Hook|url=http://www.boxing4free.com/punches/38-shovel-hook.html|publisher=Boxing4Free.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Uppercut]]
|The fist is raised vertically towards the target, usually the head or upper body. Since most guards are held with the arms in a vertical position, the uppercut can be used to avoid the opponent's attempts at blocking. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist.
|-
|Upset Punch
|Starts with the fist in the chambered position, with the palm facing downwards, delivered to the abdomen or solar plexus.
|-
|Casting Punch
|This is a punch used in [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] and [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] that starts with a forward motion of the shoulders, which causes the bent arm to whip forward to the opponent. This punch can often cause the opponent to be put in a clinch if it misses at close range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaplowitz|first=Matthew|title=How to Throw the Fedor Punch|url=http://www.thefightnerd.com/casting-punch-aka-fedor-punch/|publisher=TheFightNerd.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
|- 
|[[Superman punch|Superman Punch]]
|A '''superman punch''' or '''diving punch''' is a technique used in [[Muay Thai]], ITF-style [[Taekwon-Do]], full contact [[karate]] and [[mixed martial arts]] fighting. The striker will lunge toward the opponent pushing off with the back foot punching with the opposite arm of the leg used to push off with although there may be variations in the name and technique, depending on the fighting style. The pose should resemble that of Superman flying through the air, hence the name.
|-
|[[Sucker punch]]
| A punch that takes the enemy by surprise, possibly knocking them out or otherwise incapacitating them. Could be an unexpected blow to the stomach or a strike from behind that the victim did not see coming.

=== Boxing ===
{{main|Boxing punches}}
In boxing, punches are classified according to the motion and direction of the strike; contact is always made with the knuckles. There are four primary punches in boxing: the [[jab]], [[Cross (boxing)|cross]], [[Hook (boxing)|hook]], and [[uppercut]].  
[[Image:JJS Karate Kids on Training.jpg|left|200px|thumb|A karateka performing a 'reverse punch' or [[gyaku zuki]] being performed by two young boys.]]

=== Karate ===
[[File:Seiken.png|thumb|Seiken]]
Punching techniques in [[Karate]] are called ''[[tsuki]]'' or ''zuki''. Contact is made with the first two knuckles (''seiken'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oyama|first=Masutatsu|title=Mas Oyama's Classic Karate|year=2004|publisher=Sterling; Chrysalis (distributor)|location=New York: London|isbn=1-4027-1287-1|others=Translated by Tomoko Murakami|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; If any other part of the hand is used to strike with, such as the back of the fist (''uraken'') or the bottom of the fist (''tetsui''), then the blow is classified as a [[strike (attack)|strike]] (uchi).

Karate punches include the thrust punch ''[[Oi zuki|oi-zuki]]'' made using the lead-hand, straight punch ''[[choku-zuki]]'', reverse punch ''[[gyaku-zuki]]'', made from the opposite (lead) hand, and many other variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Funakoshi|first=Gichin|title=Karate-dō Nyūmon: The Master Introductory Text|year=1994|publisher=Kodansha International|location=Tokyo|isbn=4-7700-1891-6|others=Translated by John Teramoto|pages=51–52, 64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raewyn Connell''' (born 3 January 1944) (also known as '''R.W. Connell''', formerly '''Robert''' before her [[Transgender|transition]])  is an Australian [[sociologist]]. She gained prominence as an intellectual of the Australian [[New Left]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams-Brooks, Llewellyn (2016). "Radical Theories of Capitalism in Australia: Towards a Historiography of the Australian New Left", Honours Thesis, University of Sydney, viewed 20 April 2017, https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/16655&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently{{When|date=December 2017}} Professor Emerita at the [[University of Sydney]] and known for the concept of [[hegemonic masculinity]] and her book, ''Southern Theory''.

==Life and career==
Connell was born Robert William Connell on 3 January 1944 in [[Sydney]], Australia. Her father, William Fraser (Bill) Connell ([[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]), was a Professor of Education at the University of Sydney for many years, where he focused on educational research and teaching. Her mother, Margaret Lloyd Connell (nee Peck) was a high school science teacher. Connell has two sisters, [[Patricia Margaret Selkirk]] and Helen Connell.&lt;ref name="AWAP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0734b.htm | title=Connell, Raewyn (1944 - ) | publisher=Australian Women's Archives Project 2014 | accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USydney"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sydney.edu.au/arms/archives/history/HonConnell.shtml | title=Honorary awards - Emeritus Professor William Fraser Connell OBE | publisher=University of Sydney | accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cunningham"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cunningham.acer.edu.au/inted/onlinedocs/Connell_WFC_%20in_date_order.pdf | title=William Fraser Connell | publisher=Cunningham Library - Australian Council for Educational Research | accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SLNSW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110363071 | title=William Fraser Connell papers, 1891-2010 | publisher=State Library of New South Wales | accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connell was educated at Manly and North Sydney High Schools, and has degrees from the [[University of Melbourne]] and [[University of Sydney]]. She has held academic positions at universities in Australia, including being the founding professor of sociology at [[Macquarie University]] 1976–1991. 

In the United States Connell was visiting professor of Australian studies at [[Harvard University]] 1991–1992, and professor of sociology at [[University of California Santa Cruz]] 1992–1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raewynconnell.net/p/about-raewyn_20.html "About Raewyn"]. raewynconnell.net. Retrieved on 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a rank-and-file member of the [[Australian Labor Party]] (before the party shifted to the right in the early 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, R. (2005) [http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/clan.pdf "History of class analysis in Australia"]&lt;/ref&gt;), and a trade unionist, currently in the [[National Tertiary Education Union]].

Connell's sociology emphasises the historical nature of social reality and the transformative character of social practice.  Her writing tries to combine empirical detail, structural analysis, critique, and relevance to practice.  Much of her empirical work uses biographical (life-history) interviewing, in education, family life and workplaces. She has written or co-written twenty-one books and more than 150 research papers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raewynconnell.net/2011/01/research-publications-complete-list-or.html "Research publications (complete list)."] raewynconnell.net. Retrieved on 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is translated into 16 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raewynconnell.net/2011/08/raewyn-in-translation.html "Raewyn in translation"] raewynconnell.net. Retrieved on 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Connell serves on the editorial board or advisory board of numerous academic journals, including ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', ''[[Sexualities (journal)|Sexualities]]'', ''[[British Journal of Sociology|The British Journal of Sociology]]'', ''[[Theory &amp; Society|Theory and Society]]'', and ''The International Journal of Inclusive Education''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/about-signs/masthead/|title=Masthead|date=2012-08-22|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/education_social_work/about/staff/profiles/raewyn.connell.php|title=Professor Raewyn Connell, Academic Staff Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=The University of Sydney|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connell is a [[trans woman]], who completed her [[gender transition]] late in life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raewynconnell.net/p/about-raewyn_20.html "About Raewyn"] www.raewynconnell.net. Retrieved on 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all her earlier work was published under the gender-neutral name "R. W. Connell", up to the second edition of  "Masculinities" in 2005. A few publications are under the names Bob or Robert. Since 2006 all her work has appeared under the name Raewyn Connell. Connell has also written about [[transsexualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Raewyn. 2012. [http://www.mulabi.org/articulos_para_la_pagina/ts%20women%20and%20fist%20thought.pdf "Transsexual women and feminist thought: toward new understanding and new politics"].

(2010), [http://sexualities.sagepub.com/content/13/1/3.short "Two cans of paint: A transsexual life story, with reflections on gender change and history"], Sexualities, 13(1): 3–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major contributions==
===Class and education===
Connell first became known for research on large-scale class dynamics ("Ruling Class, Ruling Culture", 1977 and "[[Class Structure in Australian History]]", 1980), and the ways class and gender hierarchies are re-made in the everyday life of schools ("Making the Difference", 1982).

===Gender===

In the late 1980s she developed a social theory of gender relations ("Gender and Power", 1987), which emphasised that gender is a large-scale social structure not just a matter of personal identity. In applied fields she has worked on poverty and education ("Schools and Social Justice", 1993), sexuality and AIDS prevention, and labour movement strategy ("Socialism &amp; Labor", 1978).

===Masculinity===
Connell is best known outside Australia for studies of the social construction of [[masculinity]].  She was one of the founders of this research field,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fdp.edsw.usyd.edu.au/users/raewyn "Faculty of Education and Social Work – Professor Raewyn Connell"]. University of Sydney. Retrieved on 2 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and her book "Masculinities" (1995, 2005) is the most-cited in the field.  The concept of [[hegemonic masculinity]] has been particularly influential and has attracted much debate. She has been an advisor to [[UNESCO]] and UNO initiatives relating men, boys and masculinities to gender equality and peacemaking.

===Southern theory===
Connell has developed a sociology of intellectuals that emphasises the collective character of intellectual labour, and the importance of its social context.  Her 2007 book ''Southern Theory'' extended this to the global dynamics of knowledge production, critiquing the "Northern" bias of mainstream social science which is predominately produced in "metropolitan" universities. In doing so, she argues, metropolitan social theory fails to adequately explain social phenomena in the Southern experience.

She analysed examples of theoretical work deriving from the global South: including the work of [[Paulin Hountondji]], [[Ali Shariati]], [[Veena Das]], [[Ashis Nandy]] and [[Raúl Prebisch]]. Connell has also examined Southern theories of [[neoliberalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raewynconnell.net/2012/05/research-project-market-society-on.html "Research Project- Market Society on a World Scale"] raewynconnell.net.

In [[pedagogy]] and theoretical syntax, a '''sentence diagram''' or ''[[parse tree]]'' is a pictorial representation of the [[grammar|grammatical]] structure of a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. The term "sentence diagram" is used more in pedagogy, where sentences are ''diagrammed''. The term "parse tree" is used in linguistics (especially computational linguistics), where sentences are ''[[Parsing|parsed]]''. Their purposes are to demonstrate the structure of sentences. The model is informative about the relations between words and the nature of syntactic structure and is thus used as a tool to help predict which sentences are and are not possible.

== History ==
Most methods of diagramming in pedagogy are based on the work of Alonzo Reed and [[Brainerd Kellogg]] in their book ''Higher Lessons in English,'' first published in 1877, though the method has been updated with recent understanding of grammar. Reed and Kellogg were preceded, and their work probably informed, by W. S. Clark, who published his "balloon" method of depicting grammar in his 1847 book ''A Practical Grammar: In Which Words, Phrases &amp; Sentences are Classified According to Their Offices and Their Various Relationships to Each Another.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Kitty Burns Florey]] (2006) [[Sister Bernadette's Barking Dog]], [[Melville House Publishing]] {{ISBN|978-1-933633-10-7}}.  Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schoolteachers continue to use the Reed–Kellogg system in teaching grammar, but others have discouraged it in favor of more modern tree diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2003/2003-12-15.html |title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2003.12.15 |publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these modern tree structures draw on techniques that were already present in Reed–Kellogg diagrams. Reed and Kellogg defend their system in the preface to their grammar:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Objections to the Diagram.''--The fact that the pictorial diagram groups the parts of a sentence according to their offices and relations, and not in the order of speech, has been spoken of as a fault. It is, on the contrary, a merit, for it teaches the pupil to look through the literary order and discover the logical order. He thus learns what the literary order really is, and sees that this may be varied indefinitely, so long as the logical relations are kept clear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The assertion that correct diagrams can be made mechanically is not borne out by the facts. It is easier to avoid precision in oral analysis than in written. The diagram drives the pupil to a most searching examination of the sentence, brings him face to face with every difficulty, and compels a decision on every point.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These statements bear witness to the fact that Reed–Kellogg diagrams abstract away from actual word order in order to focus more intently on how words in sentences function and relate to each other.

==Reed–Kellogg system==

Simple sentences in the Reed–Kellogg system are diagrammed according to these forms:

::[[File:Sentence-diagram1.jpg|Basic Reed–Kellogg schema]]
	 
The diagram of a simple sentence begins with a horizontal line called the ''base''. The [[subject (grammar)|subject]] is written on the left, the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] on the right, separated by a vertical bar which extends through the base. The predicate must contain a [[verb]], and the verb either requires other sentence elements to complete the predicate, permits them to do so, or precludes them from doing so. The verb and its [[object (grammar)|object]], when present, are separated by a line that ends at the baseline. If the object is a [[direct object]], the line is vertical. If the object is a [[subject complement|predicate noun]] or [[predicate adjective|adjective]], the line looks like a [[backslash]], \, sloping toward the subject.

[[Grammatical modifier|Modifiers]] of the subject, predicate, or object are placed below the base line:

::[[File:Examples of Reed-Kellogg diagrams.jpg|Full Reed–Kellogg examples]]

Modifiers, such as [[adjective]]s (including articles) and [[adverb]]s, are placed on slanted lines below the word they modify. Prepositional phrases are also placed beneath the word they modify; the preposition goes on a slanted line and the slanted line leads to a horizontal line on which the object of the preposition is placed.

These basic diagramming conventions are augmented for other types of sentence structures, e.g. for [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] and [[dependent clause|subordinate clauses]].

==Constituency and dependency==
The connections to modern principles for constructing parse trees are present in the Reed–Kellogg diagrams, although Reed and Kellogg understood such principles only implicitly. The principles are now regarded as the constituency relation of [[phrase structure grammar]]s and the dependency relation of [[dependency grammar]]s. These two relations are illustrated here adjacent to each other for comparison:

::[[File:Sentence-diagram3.jpg|Constituency and dependency]]

::(D = Determiner, N = Noun, NP = Noun Phrase, S = Sentence, V = Verb, VP = Verb Phrase)

[[Image:Xbarst1.svg|thumb|X-bar theory graph of the sentence ''He studies linguistics at the university.'' IP = Inflectional phrase.]]

Constituency is a one-to-one-or-more relation; every word in the sentence corresponds to one or more nodes in the tree diagram. Dependency, in contrast, is a one-to-one relation; every word in the sentence corresponds to exactly one node in the tree diagram. Both parse trees employ the convention where the category acronyms (e.g. N, NP, V, VP) are used as the labels on the nodes in the tree. The one-to-one-or-more constituency relation is capable of increasing the amount of sentence structure to the upper limits of what is possible. The result can be very "tall" trees, such as those associated with [[X-bar theory]]. Both constituency-based and dependency-based theories of grammar have established traditions.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957"&gt;Chomsky, N. 1957. Syntactic structures. The Hague/Paris: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tesniere 1959"&gt;Tesnière, L. 1959. Éleménts de syntaxe structurale. Paris: Klincksieck.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed–Kellogg diagrams employ both of these modern tree generating relations. The constituency relation is present in the Reed–Kellogg diagrams insofar as subject, verb, object, and/or predicate are placed equi-level on the horizontal base line of the sentence and divided by a vertical or slanted line. In a Reed–Kellogg diagram, the vertical dividing line that crosses the base line corresponds to the binary division in the constituency-based tree (S → NP + VP), and the second vertical dividing line that does not cross the baseline (between verb and object) corresponds to the binary division of VP into verb and direct object (VP → V + NP). Thus the vertical and slanting lines that cross or rest on the baseline correspond to the constituency relation. The dependency relation, in contrast, is present insofar as modifiers dangle off of or appear below the words that they modify.

==Hybrid trees==
One can render Reed–Kellogg diagrams according to modern tree conventions. When one does so, the result is a hybrid dependency-constituency tree. The Reed–Kellogg diagrams above appear as the following trees:

::[[File:Sentence-diagram4.jpg|Hybrid trees]]

A mixing of labeling conventions (i.e. category label vs. actual word) helps draw attention to the presence of both constituency and dependency. The S and VP in these trees mark the constituency relation and the words themselves mark the dependency relation. A major difference between these hybrid trees and the Reed–Kellogg diagrams, however, is that the hybrid trees encode actual word order, whereas the Reed–Kellogg diagrams are abstracting away from actual word order in order to focus more on function.

==Functional breakdown==
A sentence may also be broken down by functional parts: subject, object, adverbial, verb (predicator).&lt;ref&gt;B. Arts and L. Haegerman, English Word Classes and Phrases in The Handbook of English Linguistics, Wiley– Blackewell, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is the owner of an action, the verb represents the action, the object represents the recipient of the action, and the adverbial qualifies the action. The various parts can be phrases rather than individual words.

'''Serkan Özkaya''' (1973) is a [[Turkish Americans|Turkish-American]] [[Conceptual art|conceptual artist]] whose work deals with topics of [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]] and reproduction. He typically operates outside of traditional art spaces and often makes multiple versions of even his own work including his most noted work [[David (inspired by Michelangelo)]]. Özkaya's artworks are held in the permanent collections of the [[İstanbul Modern]] and [[Perili Köşk|Borusan Contemporary Art]] in [[Istanbul]], as well as three different [[21c Museum Hotels]] locations—[[Louisville, Kentucky]]; [[Bentonville, Arkansas]]; and [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

== Early life and education ==
Özkaya grew up in [[Istanbul|Istanbul, Turkey]]. At a young age, he began learning about [[Art of Europe|Western art]] through the study of reproductions of major artworks found in books. It is here his interests in the concepts originality, replication and emulation began.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stlbeacon.org/#!/content/13301/review_serkan_ozkaya_works_magic|title=Review: Serkan Ozkaya works magic|last=Cooper|first=Ivy|date=2008-10-07|website=STL Beacon|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150411222101/https://www.stlbeacon.org/%23!/content/13301/review_serkan_ozkaya_works_magic#!/content/13301/review_serkan_ozkaya_works_magic|archive-date=2015-04-11|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Istanbul University]], graduating with both a bachelor and a master's degree in arts.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magazine.art21.org/2011/07/01/inside-the-artists-studio-serkan-ozkaya/|title=Inside the Artist's Studio {{!}} Serkan Özkaya|last=Kotretsos|first=Georgia|date=2011-07-01|website=Art21 Magazine|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his graduate studies at [[Bard College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/04/another-handdrawn-newspaper.html|title=Serkan Ozkaya, Dave Muller and the hand-drawn newspaper|last=Knight|first=Christopher|date=2009-04-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After leaving Bard with a master's degree in fine art,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; he received an art fellowship at [[MacDowell Colony]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Özkaya then returned to Istanbul University to study for his Ph.D. in German Language and Literature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2001, he published ''Genius and Creativity in the Arts'', a comparative study of the German works [[Moses und Aron]] (an opera by [[Arnold Schoenberg]]), [[Doctor Faustus (novel)|Doctor Faustus]] (a novel by [[Thomas Mann]]) and [[:de:Die Philosophie der Neuen Musik|Die Philosophie der Neuen Musik]] (a book by [[Theodor W. Adorno]]).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Notable works in serial form ===
''Dear Sir or Madam'' (1996–2009) is a collection of letters and other correspondences between Özkaya and cultural institutions, dignitaries and curators. It is his own paper trail of bureaucracy in inaction. In the collection, among others, are his letters to the Louvre asking that he be allowed to hang the [[Mona Lisa]] upside down&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/15/arts/design/15serk.html|title=Serkan Ozkaya - Art - Report|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=2006-12-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a letter to the [[Bundestag|German Bundestag]] that they permit him to re-[[Christo and Jeanne-Claude#Wrapped Reichstag|wrap the Reichstag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/zeitgenoessische-kunst-aus-istanbul-im-haus-der-kulturen-der-welt-gewitzte-metaphern-16772842|title=Zeitgenössische Kunst aus Istanbul im Haus der Kulturen der Welt: Gewitzte Metaphern|last=Böker|first=Carmen|work=Berliner Zeitung|access-date=2017-09-08|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the letters do not deserve a response but curiously, they have usually been treated with official but unthinking courtesy, read perhaps but not comprehended—answered and then often passed along the bureaucratic chain. In 2009, ''Dear Sir or Madam'' was exhibited at the Slag Gallery in New York along with works from the same period. Among them was ''Proletarier Aller Laender'' (1998-2009) or ''Proletariat of all Countries'', as it is also known in English, a collection of red plastic foam figurines glued to the floor. In viewing this work, the audience is most likely forced to trample on the little figures&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as if to trample on the working classes. However, the [[proletariat]], which the figurines represent, in their resilience and ultimate power always springing back, indestructible.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Other works in the exhibition included the golden sculptures ''Levitation by Defecation'' (2008), ''Shit on a Stick'' (2008), and ''Goldenboy'' (2006), "a fiberglass figure painted in gold acrylic and dangling a couple of feet off the ground by a noose".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2000, Özkaya collected roughly 30,000 slides from artists, galleries, and institutions and showed them on one of the largest galleries in the main pedestrian street in Istanbul, at the Kazim Taskent Art Gallery. ''What A Museum Should Really Look Like (Large Glass)'' presented a giant mosaic of individual images. During the day the slides were readable from the inside of the gallery and at night, with the lights on, they became a scene for the street. This piece was later initiated in [[Utrecht|Utrecht, the Netherlands]] in a much larger scale with 100,000 slides.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The collage of thousands of pieces of artwork was collected through an online advertisement. All of the works were arranged in the mosaic with no coherent order and no editorial or curatorial control from Özkaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/18/arts/art-review-politics-that-makes-peace-with-the-beauty-of-objects.html|title=ART REVIEW; Politics That Makes Peace With the Beauty of Objects|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=2004-06-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Özkaya turned the front and back covers of the [[Turkish language]] newspaper, ''[[Radikal]]'' into drawings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This act enabled the reader to acquire a limited edition artwork for the price of the newspaper.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} In early 2004, it was part of a group exhibition named "The Poetics of Proximity" at the Guggenheim Gallery at [[Chapman University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/arts/strange-land-6381040|title=Strange Land|last=Schoenkopf|first=Rebecca|date=2004-02-19|work=OC Weekly|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In similar fashion, in subsequent years, some pages of several other newspapers were also hand-rendered and appeared as a print of the drawings. The overall piece, entitled ''Today Could Be A Day Of Historical Importance'' was executed in Sweden with ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', in Germany with Freitag,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freitag.de/autoren/der-freitag/kopierer-aller-lander|title=Kopierer aller Länder...|last=Arend|first=Ingo|date=2005-08-07|website=der Freitag|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the US with ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Courier-Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2009/04/10/kentucky-page-1a-turned-into-piece-of-newspaper-art/|title=Kentucky Page 1A turned into piece of newspaper art|last=Associated Press|first=|date=2009-04-10|website=The Denver Post|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of which was created in collaboration with the non-profit artwithoutwalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/10/louisvilles-emcourier-jou_n_185558.html|title=Louisville's Courier-Journal Front Page Completely Drawn By Artist|last=Shea|first=Danny|date=2009-05-11|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' version in the "Weekend Arts" section appeared ''[[mise en abyme]]'' with Özkaya's drawing appearing as an inset in the page and an even smaller drawing appearing as an inset of that, and so on, creating a [[Droste effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://graphics.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/magazine/serk.pdf|title=Weekend Arts: Fine Arts, Leisure|last=|first=|date=2006-12-15|website=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Louisville, high class (7963849776).jpg|thumb|[[David (inspired by Michelangelo)]] in front of [[21c Museum Hotels|21c Museum Hotel]]]]
In 2005, Özkaya created ''[[David (inspired by Michelangelo)]]'', a double-sized golden replica of [[Michelangelo]]ʼs [[David (Michelangelo)|''David'']] based on a 3D computer model by [[Marc Levoy]] of [[Stanford University]].

In ''A Sudden Gust of Wind'' (2007 –2013), Özkaya depicted the journey of a stack of papers blown away by the wind. The original work was made with basic materials: [[ISO 216#A series|standard A4 paper]], thread, and glue. The piece was inspired by ''Ejiri in Suruga Province (A Sudden Gust of Wind)'', a 19th-century Japanese woodcut by [[Hokusai]], and ''A Sudden Gust of Wind (after Hokusai)'' (1993) by [[Jeff Wall]]. One version of the installation was first exhibited at the Boots Contemporary Art Space in St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another version of the work was acquired by 21c Museum Hotel and installed at their third location in [[Bentonville, Arkansas]].

[[File:BRING ME THE HEAD OF.JPG|thumb|''Bring me the head of...'' at Freemans' Restaurant as part of [[Performa (performance festival)|Performa07]]]]
''Bring me the head of…'' (2007–2015) is the edible form of a teddy bear's head on a plate. Instead of working with museums or galleries, in this series, Özkaya collaborated with restaurants and chefs and they decided the ingredients—that is the material of the sculpture. This work was made in collaboration with [[M on the Bund]] in [[Shanghai]],&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://v3.arkitera.com/arsgratiaartis.php?action=displayNewsItem&amp;ID=20470|title=Serkan Özkaya yeni heykeli ile Şanghay'da|last=|first=|date=2007-09-24|website=Arkitera.com|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; offered at Freemans' Restaurant in New York in 2007 as a part of the [[Performa (performance festival)|Performa Biennial]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.p-e-r-f-o-r-m-a-n-c-e.org/?p=2578|title=With every bite, a bit of history|last=Goldberg|first=Roselee|date=2016|website=p-e-r-f-o-r-m-a-n-c-e|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zine.artcat.com/2007/11/bring-me-the-head-of-serkan-ozkaya.php|title=Bring Me the Head of Serkan Özkaya|last=Vartanian|first=Hrag|date=2007-11-28|website=Artcat|language=en|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Changa in Istanbul in 2008, as street food in [[İzmir|Izmir]] in 2009,{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} at Capital M in [[Beijing]] in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2012/05/25/art-attack-oklahoma-moves-bookstore-opens-exhibits-close-and-wanda-buys-amc|title=Art Attack: Oklahoma!

''An Attempt at Exhausting A Place…'' is a series of works in which the artist "dissolves the white cube" and the usual constraints of a traditional art space.

=== Other notable works ===
''Atlas'' (2011) is a contribution to a walking museum wherein Özkaya constructed a rock to be strapped to the curator's back and promenaded daily throughout the streets of New York. The idea was to make "the museum" itself wander around the streets of the city with Özkaya's new piece, a giant rock.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

''Radisson/Picasso'' (2012), a pair of [[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Hotel]] matchboxes with the text of one of which has been changed to read "Picasso" instead of "Radisson" and was displayed alongside the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/friday-photo-radissonpicasso/|title=Friday Photo: Radisson/Picasso|last=Murg|first=Stephanie|date=2012-03-23|work=AdWeek|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mirage'' (2013) was installed at the Postmasters Gallery in New York and consisted of a shadow of a passenger airplane that crossed the room for 45 seconds every four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/76818/a-shadowy-plane-in-the-cave/|title=A Shadowy Plane in the Cave|last=Vartanian|first=Hrag|date=2013-07-31|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shadow here was considered not as the mere absence of light but rather as a material in and of itself which could then be sculpted. The work was also exhibited as part of the Borusan Contemporary Art Collection's Overture: New Acquisitions (2015) at [[Perili Köşk]] in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/arts-culture/2014/12/03/two-new-exhibitions-open-at-borusan-contemporary|title=Two new exhibitions open at Borusan Contemporary|last=|first=|date=2014-12-03|work=DailySabah|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''MyMoon'' (2015 – present) is another artwork by Özkaya, a large round rock floating in the sky, that is visible only through a [[smartphone]] via the MyMoon app. Using the phone's GPS and compass, MyMoon app detects the object in the sky and makes it visible.

In October 2017, Özkaya presented his latest major work ''En attendons'' (''We Will Wait'') at the Postmasters Gallery. The work is a recreation of [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Étant donnés]]'' from which Özkaya's also gets its name in [[anagram]] form.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/arts/design/now-you-see-him-now-you-dont-duchamp-from-beyond-the-grave.html|title=Now You See Him, Now You Don’t: Duchamp From Beyond the Grave|last=Mewshaw|first=Marc|date=2017-09-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özkaya claims to have discovered a secret hidden within Duchamp's piece.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/duchamp-etant-donnes-secret-serkan-ozkaya-1103216|title=Has Duchamp’s Final Work Harbored a Secret for Five Decades?|last=Boucher|first=Brian|date=2017-10-03|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that it is not only a [[peephole]] into a [[diorama]] but that, under proper lighting, it also functions as a [[camera obscura]] that projects the French artist's self-portrait on a surface opposite the peephole.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; According to Özkaya, there is more to ''Étant Donnés'' than previously thought; that the work, which took Duchamp more than 20 years to create,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/privy-to-the-secrets-of-marcel-duchamp/article37436946/|title=A century later, Marcel Duchamp's Fountain continues to beguile the art world|last=Smith|first=Russell|date=December 27, 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; projects an image of Rrose Sélavy, "Duchamp’s female alter ego."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/10/18/duchamps-last-riddle/|title=Duchamp’s Last Riddle|last=Steinhauer|first=Jillian|date=2017-10-18|website=The Paris Review|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11966">The '''situational theory of problem solving''' attempts to explain why and how an individual communicates during a problematic situation. The Situational Theory of Problem Solving (STOPS) was proposed by Jeong-Nam Kim and [[James E. Grunig]] in 2011 though their article “problem solving and communicative action: A situational theory of problem solving.” The theory was developed from the [[situational theory of publics]] (STP) and claimed it is “an extended and generalized version” of STP.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jeong-Nam|last2=Grunig|first2=James E.|date=2011|year=|title=Problem Solving and Communicative Action: A Situational Theory of Problem Solving|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01529.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=61|issue=1|pages=120–149|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01529.x|issn=1460-2466|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has an assumption that “the more one commits to problem resolution, the more one becomes acquisitive of information pertaining to the problem, selective in dealing with information, and transmissive in giving it to others.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Extension from situational theory of publics ===
STP has been heavily used in the field of [[public relations]] to understand why and how publics communicate. The original situational theory uses three independent variables (problem recognition, constraint recognition, and involvement recognition) to predict the dependent variable of information seeking and processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aldoory|first=Linda|last2=Kim|first2=Jeong-Nam|last3=Tindall|first3=Natalie|date=2010|year=|title=The influence of perceived shared risk in crisis communication: Elaborating the situational theory of publics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363811109001994|journal=Public Relations Review|volume=36|issue=2|pages=134–140|doi=10.1016/j.pubrev.2009.12.002|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://succeed.stir.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/PREP86_201314_Autumn_A/Digitised_extracts/PREP86GrunigSituational.pdf|title=Public relations research: an international perspective.|last=Grunig|first=J.|date=1997|publisher=International Thomson Business Press|year=|isbn=0415109957|editor-last=Grunig|editor-first=J|location=London|pages=3–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STOPS was proposed to overcome four limitations of STP:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# STP considered only information acquisition as a concept of active communication behaviors
# The predictive power of referent criterion variable has been unclear throughout the development of STP
# Only few antecedents of communication behavior were considered
# STP was underutilized because of the narrow concept of information behaviors
Alterations in existed variables (problem recognition, constraint recognition, involvement recognition, and reference criterion) were done to explain communicative action in problem solving variable. STOPS also expanded the focus of the theory from "decisions" to a more general concept of life "problems." A new variable, situational motivation in problem solving, was added to mediate the effects of predictive variables of communicative behavior.

== Concepts of key variables ==

=== Situational antecedents: perceptual and cognitive frame in problem solving ===
* '''Problem Recognition''': “one’s perception that something is missing and that there is no immediately applicable solution to it.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Constraint Recognition:''' perceived obstacles in a problem-solving task that reduce one’s ability to do anything about the issue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Constraint recognition limit one’s communication behaviors even when he or she has high problem recognition and/or involvement recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramanadhan|first=Shoba|last2=Viswanath|first2=K.|date=2006|year=|title=Health and the Information Nonseeker: A Profile|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327027hc2002_4|journal=Health Communication|volume=20|issue=2|pages=131–139|doi=10.1207/s15327027hc2002_4|issn=1041-0236|pmid=16965250|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Involvement Recognition''': “a perceived connection between the self and the problem situation.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This variable has the same concept of the level of involvement in the situational theory of publics.
* '''Referent Criterion''': “any knowledge or subjective judgmental system that influences the way in which one approaches problem solving.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Situational motivation in problem solving ===
The extent to which an individual wants to know more about a problem. This concept mediates the effect of problem recognition, constraint recognition, and involvement recognition. Referent criterion would be independent of this variable because it is more cognitive than perceptual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Communicative behavior in problem solving ===
When an individual tries to solve a problem, his or her communicative activeness increases in three domains of communication action: information acquisition, selection, and transmission.

==== Information acquisition ====
The communicative action that is relevant to the degrees of information searching for problem solving.
* '''Information seeking (active)''': a planned perusing of messages about a specific topic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* '''Information attending (passive)''': an unplanned exposure for messages about a specific topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Peter|last2=Kline|first2=F. Gerald|date=2016|year=|title=Media Effects Reconsidered|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009365027400100205|journal=Communication Research|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=224–240|doi=10.1177/009365027400100205|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Information selection ====
The communicative action that is relevant to the extent of an individual's directedness in acquiring and sharing information.
* '''Information forefending (active)''': “the extent to which a communicator fends off certain information in advance by judging its value and relevance for a given problem-solving task.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Individuals with higher information forefending look for more specific, systematic, and accurate information.
* '''Information permitting (passive)''': the extent to which an individual accept any information related to a problem-solving task.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Information transmission ====
The communicative action that is relevant to the degrees of educating others to utilize collective behaviors for problem solving.
* '''Information forwarding (active)''': forwarding information even if no one requests for one’s opinion, idea, or expertise about a problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Information sharing (passive)''': sharing of information only when other person asks for one’s opinion, idea, or expertise about a problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Model ==
An individual’s perception toward a problematic life situation, motivation to solve the problem, and activation of cognitive frames influence an individual’s activeness in six information behaviors – information forefending, information permitting, information forwarding, information sharing, information seeking, and information attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yi-Ru Regina|last2=Hung-Baesecke|first2=Chun-Ju Flora|last3=Kim|first3=Jeong-Nam|date=2017|year=|title=Identifying Active Hot-Issue Communicators and Subgroup Identifiers|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077699016629371|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=94|issue=1|pages=124–147|doi=10.1177/1077699016629371|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7199">'''Social citizenship''' was a term first coined by [[T.H. Marshall]], who argued that the ideal citizenship experience entails access to political, civil and social rights in a state.&lt;ref name="Rummery"&gt;Rummery, Kirstein. (2002). "Disability, Citizenship and Community Care: A Case for Welfare Rights?" Hampshire: Ashgate publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marshall, social citizenship includes “the whole range from the right to a modicum of economic welfare and security to the right to share to the full in the social heritage and to live the life of a civilized being according to the standards prevailing in society”.&lt;ref name="Beckett"&gt;Beckett, Angharad E. (2006). "Citizenship and Vulnerability: Disability and Issues of Social and Political Engagement". Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrove Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall’s concept of social policy has been critiqued by some scholars for being idealistic and only applicable to the participation of able-bodied white males.&lt;ref name="Borsay"&gt;Borsay, Anne. (2005). "Disability and Social Policy in Britain since 1750". Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrove Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Social Policy in Britain==
Under the [[Elizabethan Poor Law]], social rights were not part of citizenship status.&lt;ref name="Rummery"/&gt; The Poor Law Act of 1601 placed the responsibility of caring for the disabled on the family; the state was not legally obligated to care for those who were unable to work.&lt;ref name="Borsay"/&gt; By the middle of the seventeenth century, small pensions were allocated to the poor, which often included disabled persons who were barred from wage labor, although these provisions were meager and not substantial enough to live off of.&lt;ref name="Borsay"/&gt;

In 1834, the [[Poor Law Amendment Act]] was created in order to reduce the number of able-bodied poor who received a pension.&lt;ref name="Borsay"/&gt; While the disabled were able to access monetary assistance, they could only receive indoor assistance through institutionalization.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;Barnes, Colin &amp; Mercer, Geof. (2010). "Exploring Disability". Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This structure of monetary provision stigmatized the disabled for their lack of participation in the labor force and ostracized them from the community, a result that reflects the cultural emphasis placed upon the ability and willingness to participate in the labor force.&lt;ref name="Borsay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

Beginning in the early 1900s, a “residual approach” to social policy was enacted in Britain where financial assistance would be provided to those without support at a minimal level in order to encourage active participation in the labor force.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Post-1945, additions were made to this social welfare approach that encompassed political-economic, social, and organizational reform.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;  Political-economic motivation emphasized reform encouraging high rates of employment, lower taxes, and minimal welfare dependents.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Social reform placed women, children, the elderly and the disabled as dependents of a male wage-earner which cast further distinctions between impaired and able-bodied citizens.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Finally, organizational reforms gave professionals increasing state support and decision making power in the realm of social services, especially in the case of health services.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

==Social Citizenship and the Disabled Today==
The current model of the welfare state, whereby social citizenship is obtained, encourages citizens to enter a “welfare market” in which they become consumers of welfare benefits, especially benefits linked to health and social care.&lt;ref name="Rummery"/&gt; Beginning in 1979, the conservative administration led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] encouraged this model, arguing that market based access to social citizenship allows for the empowerment of citizens.&lt;ref name="Rummery"/&gt; This capitalist model, advocates claim, allows citizens to obtain full social citizenship by becoming “competent members of society,” which according to citizenship theorists Turner and Marshall is a key aspect of being a member of the state.&lt;ref name="Rummery"/&gt; Whereas barred access to full social citizenship was combated by strengthening the private sector under Thatcher, the New Labour Government elected in 1997 focused on the expansion of public services in order to raise employment, and combat poverty.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Under the New Labour government, social inclusion became one of the primary rights of social citizenship in Britain.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Social inclusion is multifaceted and includes the right of a citizen to participate in society and the economy.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

==Relevant legislation==
The [[Disability Discrimination Act]] of 1995 was the first social policy created to prevent exclusion and discrimination in matters of the economy, though the act did not address prevalent inequalities in education and transportation.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

In 2001, the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act (SENDA) made discrimination against special needs students illegal and called for 'reasonable adjustments' to be made in order to ensure equal access to education, a crucial aspect of social citizenship.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

The Disability Equality Duty (DED) created in 2005 called for institutions to begin planning changes to infrastructure in order to further include people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

==Critiques of Social Rights==
Disability Rights movements in Europe have primarily been centered on making changes in social welfare policy.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Organizations advocating for disability rights in Britain have argued for the elimination of stereotypes that cast people with disabilities as vulnerable and in need of community care.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; In the current system, health and service providers have been in control of assessing the needs of the disabled.&lt;ref name="Rummery"/&gt; Many disability rights organizations in Britain have pushed against this system in which the practitioner’s expertise takes precedence over the experience and assessment of the patient.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Biehal and colleagues have stated, “Many users of social services are excluded from full citizenship. Their right to treatment as equals may be limited by poverty, racism, assumptions about gender, age and disability”.&lt;ref name="Rummery"/&gt;

Policies created to ensure the social participation of British citizens with disabilities have been critiqued for not being strict enough. The 1995 Disability Discrimination Act has been accused of providing only limited protection as it did not include protection from discrimination in education or transportation.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; In addition, 90% of employers were exempt from following the Act due to the fact that they had fewer than 20 employees.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; The policies that were designed to answer these critiques have also been accused of being inadequate as they are difficult to enforce.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

'''Social mobility''' is the movement of individuals, families, households, or other categories of people within or between [[Social stratification|social strata]] in a society.  It is a change in [[social status]] relative to one's current social location within a given society.

==Definition==
Social mobility is defined as the movement of individuals, families, households, or other categories of people within or between layers or tiers in an [[Open system (systems theory)#Social sciences|open system]] of [[social stratification]]. Open stratification systems are those in which at least some value is given to [[achieved status|achieved status characteristics]] in a society. The movement can be in a ''downward'' or ''upward'' direction.&lt;ref name="socialscienceandmedicinesimandan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simandan |first1=Dragos |title=Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |date=March 2018 |volume=200 |pages=258-261 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heckman, J.J. and Mosso, S., 2014. The economics of human development and social mobility. Annu. Rev. Econ., 6(1), pp.689-733.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==
Mobility is most often [[quantitative research|quantitatively]] measured in terms of change in [[economic mobility]] such as changes in [[income]] or [[wealth]].

Intergenerational upward mobility is more common, where children or grandchildren are in economic circumstances better than those of their parents or grandparents.

===Social status and social class===
[[File:Going up or down advertisement.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Illustration from a 1916 advertisement for a vocational school in the back of a US magazine. Education has been seen as a key to social mobility, and the advertisement appealed to Americans' belief in the possibility of self-betterment as well as threatening the consequences of downward mobility in the great [[income inequality]] existing during the [[Industrial Revolution]].]]

Social mobility is highly dependent on the overall structure of [[social status]]es and [[Employment|occupations]] in a given society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2095555 | title=Comparative Social Mobility Revisited: Models of Convergence and Divergence in 16 Countries |author1=Grusky, David B  |author2=Robert M. Hauser  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=American Sociological Review |date=February 1984  | volume=49 | issue=1 | pages=19–38 | doi=10.2307/2095555}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of differing social positions and the manner in which they fit together or overlap provides the overall [[social structure]] of such positions.  Add to this the differing dimensions of status, such as [[Max Weber]]'s [[three-component theory of stratification|delineation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Weber, Max|year=1946|chapter=Class, Status, Party|pages=180–95|title=From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology|editors=H. H. Girth and C. Wright Mills|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; of economic stature, prestige, and power and we see the potential for complexity in a given social stratification system. Such dimensions within a given society can be seen as [[independent variable]]s that can explain differences in social mobility at different times and places in different stratification systems. In addition, the same variables that contribute as [[intervening variable]]s to the valuation of income or wealth and that also affect social status, [[social class]], and [[social inequality]] do affect social mobility.  These include [[gender inequality|sex or gender]], [[racism|race]] or [[ethnocentrism|ethnicity]], and [[ageism|age]].&lt;ref name="Hill1998"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Toward a new vision: race, class and gender as categories of analysis and connection |title=Social Class and Stratification: Classic Statements and Theoretical Debates |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |last=Collins |first=Patricia Hill | year=1998 | location=Boston | pages=231–247 |isbn=0-8476-8542-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education provides one of the most promising chances of upward social mobility into a better social class and attaining a higher social status, regardless of current social standing in the overall structure of society. However, the stratification of social classes and high wealth inequality directly affects the educational opportunities people are able to obtain and succeed in, and the chance for one's upward social mobility. In other words, social class and a family's socioeconomic status directly affect a child's chances for obtaining a quality education and succeeding in life. By age five, there are significant developmental differences between low, middle, and upper class children's cognitive and noncognitive skills.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/thirteen-economic-facts-about-social-mobility-and-the-role-of-education/|title=Thirteen Economic Facts about Social Mobility and the Role of Education|last=Greenstone|first=M|last2=Looney|first2=A|date=November 18, 2016|website=Brookings Institution|access-date=April 5, 2017|last3=Patashnik|first3=J|last4=Yu|first4=M}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Among older children, evidence suggests that the gap between high- and low-income primary- and secondary-school students has increased by almost 40 percent over the past thirty years. These differences persist and widen into young adulthood and beyond. Just as the gap in K–12 test scores between high- and low-income students is growing, the difference in college graduation rates between the rich and the poor is also growing. Although the college graduation rate among the poorest households increased by about 4 percentage points between those born in the early 1960s and those born in the early 1980s, over this same period, the graduation rate increased by almost 20 percentage points for the wealthiest households.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Average family income, and social status, have both seen a decrease for the bottom third of all children between 1975-2011. The 5th percentile of children and their families have seen up to a 60% decrease in average family income.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The wealth gap between the rich and the poor, the upper and lower class, continues to increase as more middle-class people get poorer and the lower-class get even poorer. As the socioeconomic inequality continues to increase in the United States, being on either end of the spectrum makes a child more likely to remain there, and never become socially mobile.
&lt;blockquote&gt;A child born to parents with income in the lowest quintile is more than ten times more likely to end up in the lowest quintile than the highest as an adult (43 percent versus 4 percent). And, a child born to parents in the highest quintile is five times more likely to end up in the highest quintile than the lowest (40 percent versus 8 percent).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is due to lower- and working-class parents (where at least one has at most a high school diploma) spending less time on average with their children in their earliest years of life and not being as involved in their children's education and time out of school. This parenting style, known as "accomplishment of natural growth" differs from the style of middle-class and upper-class parents (with at least one parent having higher education), known as "cultural cultivation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life|last=Lareau|first=Annette|publisher=University of California Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More affluent social classes are able to spend more time with their children at early ages, and children receive more exposure to interactions and activities that lead to cognitive and non-cognitive development: things like verbal communication, parent-child engagement, and being read to daily. These children's parents are much more involved in their academics and their free time; placing them in extracurricular activities which develop not only additional non-cognitive skills but also academic values, habits, and abilities to better communicate and interact with authority figures. Lower class children often attend lower quality schools, receive less attention from teachers, and ask for help much less than their higher class peers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haveman|first=Robert|last2=Smeeding|first2=Timothy|date=2006-01-01|title=The Role of Higher Education in Social Mobility|journal=The Future of Children|volume=16|issue=2|pages=125–150|jstor=3844794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chances for social mobility are primarily determined by the family a child is born into. Today, the gaps seen in both access to education and educational success (graduating from a higher institution) is even larger. Today, while college applicants from every socioeconomic class are equally qualified, 75% of all entering freshmen classes at top-tier American institutions belong to the uppermost socioeconomic quartile. A family's class determines the amount of investment and involvement parents have in their children's educational abilities and success from their earliest years of life,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; leaving low-income students with less chance for academic success and social mobility due to the effects that the (common) parenting style of the lower and working-class have on their outlook on and success in education.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Class cultures and social networks===

These differing dimensions of social mobility can be classified in terms of differing types of capital that contribute to changes in mobility.  [[Cultural capital]], a term first coined by French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] is the process of distinguishing between the economic aspects of class and powerful cultural assets. Bourdieu described three types of capital that place a person in a certain social category: [[economic capital]]; [[social capital]]; and cultural capital.  [[Economic capital]] includes economic resources such as [[cash]], [[credit (finance)|credit]], and other material [[assets]].

Social capital includes resources one achieves based on group membership, networks of influence, relationships and support from other people. Cultural capital is any advantage a person has that gives them a higher status in society, such as [[education]], skills, or any other form of knowledge. Usually, people with all three types of capital have a high status in society. Bourdieu found that the culture of the upper social class is oriented more toward formal reasoning and abstract thought. The lower social class is geared more towards matters of facts and the necessities of life. He also found that the environment in which person develops has a large effect on the cultural resources that a person will have.&lt;ref name=Bourdieu&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourdieu |first=Pierre |title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Distinction.html?id=02NKcAAACAAJ |accessdate=15 February 2013 |year=1984 |publisher=Routledge |location=London: |isbn=0415567882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural resources a person has obtained can heavily influence a child's educational success. It has been shown that students raised under the concerted cultivation approach have "an emerging sense of entitlement" which leads to asking teachers more questions and being a more active student, causing teachers to favor students raised in this manner.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life|publisher=University of California Press|last1=Lareau|first1=Annette}}&lt;/ref&gt; This childrearing approach which creates positive interactions in the classroom environment is in contrast with the natural growth approach to childrearing. In this approach, which is more common amongst working-class families, parents do not focus on developing the special talents of their individual children, and they speak to their children in directives. Due to this, it is more rare for a child raised in this manner to question or challenge adults and conflict arises between childrearing practices at home and school. Children raised in this manner are less inclined to participate in the classroom setting and are less likely to go out of their way to positively interact with teachers and form relationships.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In the United States, links between minority underperformance in our schools have been made with a lacking in the cultural resources of cultural capital, social capital, and economic capital, yet inconsistencies persist even when these variables are accounted for. "Once admitted to institutions of higher education, African Americans and Latinos continued to underperform relative to their white and Asian counterparts, earning lower grades, progressing at a slower rate, and dropping out at higher rates. More disturbing was the fact that these differentials persisted even after controlling for obvious factors such as SAT scores and family socioeconomic status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Shape of the River : Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions|last2=Bok|first2=Derek|authorlink2=Derek Bok| publisher=Princeton University Press|last1=Bowen|first1=William|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCy2CwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781400882793|date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory of capital deficiency is among the most recognized explanations for minority underperformance academically—that for whatever reason they simply lack the resources to find academic success.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Source of the River: The Social Origins of Freshmen at America's Selective Colleges and Universities|last2=Charles|first2=Camille|last3=Lundy|first3=Garvey|last4=Fischer|first4=Mary|publisher=Princeton University Press|last1=Massey|first1=Douglas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-PYX6pox7wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=1400840767|date=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the largest factors for this, asides from the social, economic, and cultural capital mentioned earlier, is human capital. This form of capital, identified by social scientists only in recent years, has to do with the education and life preparation of children. "Human capital refers to the skills, abilities, and knowledge possessed by specific individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis, with Special Reference to Education |last1=Becker |first1=Gary |year=1964 |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows college-educated parents who have large amounts of human capital to invest in their children in certain ways to maximize future success—from reading to them at night to possessing a better understanding of the school system which causes them to be less differential to teachers and school authorities.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Research also shows that well-educated black parents are less able to transmit human capital to their children when compared to their white counterparts, due to a legacy of racism and discrimination.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Patterns of mobility==
While it is generally accepted that some level of mobility in society is desirable, there is no consensus agreement upon "how much" social mobility is "good" or "bad" for a society. There is no international "[[Benchmarking|benchmark]]" of social mobility, though one can compare measures of mobility across regions or countries or within a given area over time.&lt;ref name="OECD11"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Intergenerational Social Mobility in OECD Countries |author1=Causa, Orsetta   |author2=Åsa Johansson  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Economic Studies | year=2011 | volume=2010 | issue=1 |pages=1   | doi=10.1787/eco_studies-2010-5km33scz5rjj}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cross-cultural studies comparing differing types of economies are possible, comparing economies of similar type usually yields more comparable data. Such comparisons typically look at intergenerational mobility, examining the extent to which children born into different families have different life chances and outcomes.

[[File:The Great Gatsby Curve.png|thumb|350px|crop top=10px|The [[Great Gatsby Curve]]. Countries with more equality of wealth also have more social mobility. This indicates that equality of wealth and equality of opportunity go hand-in-hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://milescorak.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/income-inequality-equality-of-opportunity-and-intergenerational-mobility.pdf | title=Income Inequality, Equality of Opportunity, and Intergenerational Mobility | date=July 8, 2013 | author=Miles Corak | doi=10.1257/jep.27.3.79}} Forthcoming in the ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'' .&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In a study for which the results were first published in 2009, [[The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better|Wilkinson and Pickett]] conduct an exhaustive analysis of social mobility in [[developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger | publisher=Bloomsbury Press |author1=Wilkinson,  Richard   |author2=Kate Pickett  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2009 | isbn=978-1608190362}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to other correlations with negative social outcomes for societies having high inequality, they found a relationship between high social inequality and low social mobility. Of the eight countries studied—Canada, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany, the UK and the US, the US had both the highest economic inequality and lowest economic mobility.  In this and other studies, in fact, the USA has very low mobility at the lowest rungs of the socioeconomic ladder, with mobility increasing slightly as one goes up the ladder.  At the top rung of the ladder, however, mobility again decreases.&lt;ref name="Brookings2008"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2008/2/economic%20mobility%20sawhill/02_economic_mobility_sawhill_ch3.pdf | title=International Comparisons of Economic Mobility | publisher=Brookings Institution | author=Isaacs, Julia B. | year=2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721020013/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2008/2/economic%20mobility%20sawhill/02_economic_mobility_sawhill_ch3.pdf | archivedate=21 July 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Intergenerational mobility graph-1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Comparison of social mobility in selected countries]]

Studies have also found "a clear negative relationship" between income inequality and intergenerational mobility.&lt;ref name=krugman&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/the-great-gatsby-curve/ The Great Gatsby Curve] Paul Krugman| 15 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Countries with low levels of inequality such as [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]] had some of the greatest mobility, while the two countries with the high level of inequality—[[Chile]] and [[Brazil]]—had some of the lowest mobility.

In Britain, much debate on social mobility has been generated by comparisons of the 1958 National Child Development Study ([http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/ncds NCDS]) and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/bcs70 BCS70],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blanden |first=J. |first2=S. |last2=Machin |first3=A. |last3=Goodman |first4=P. |last4=Gregg |year=2004 |chapter=Changes in intergenerational mobility in Britain |editor-first=M. |editor-last=Corak |title=Generational Income Mobility in North America and Europe |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-82760-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which compare intergenerational mobility in earnings between the 1958 and the 1970 UK cohorts, and claim that intergenerational mobility decreased substantially in this 12-year period.

[[Thomas Piketty]] (2014) finds that wealth-income ratios, today, seem to be returning to very high levels in low economic growth countries, similar to what he calls the "classic patrimonial" wealth-based societies of the 19th century wherein a minority lives off its wealth while the rest of the population works for subsistence living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Capital in the 21st century | publisher=Belknap Press | author=Piketty, Thomas | year=2014 | isbn=978-0674430006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social mobility can also be influenced by differences that exist within education. The contribution of education to social mobility often gets neglected in social mobility research although it really has the potential to transform the relationship between origins and destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01425692.2013.826414?needAccess|title=Education and social mobility|last=|first=|date=2013|volume=34|issue=5–6|pages=637–643|journal=British Journal of Sociology of Education|access-date=|doi=10.1080/01425692.2013.826414|author=Phillip Brown|author2=Diane Reay|author3=Carol Vincent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the disparities between strictly location and its educational opportunities highlights how patterns of educational mobility are influencing the capacity for individuals to experience social mobility.

The patterns of educational mobility that exist between inner city schools versus schools in the suburbs is transparent. Graduation rates supply a rich context to these patterns.

Lack of education frequently leads to lack of success in the future for many individuals. They do not possess the degrees required to even apply for a plethora of jobs. Therefore, these individuals may get stuck in communities that are at a stand still. Ultimately, the social classes remain stagnant because nothing is changing within each social construct and education is at the forefront in terms of its contribution to the future issues.

==Influence of intelligence and education==

[[Status attainment|Social status attainment]] and therefore social mobility in adulthood are of interest to psychologists, sociologists, political scientists, economists, epidemiologists and many more. The reason behind the interest is because it indicates access to material goods, educational opportunities, healthy environments, and nonetheless the economic growth.&lt;ref name="Deary, et al., 2005"&gt;Deary, I.

Researchers did a study that encompassed a wide range of data of individuals in lifetime (in childhood and during mid-adulthood). Most of the Scottish children which were born in 1921 participated in the Scottish Mental Survey 1932, which was conducted under the auspices of the [[Scottish Council for Research in Education]] (SCRE)&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Council for Research in Education (1933). The intelligence of Scottish children: A national survey of an age-group.
London, UK7 University of London Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained the data of psychometric intelligence of Scottish pupils. The number of children who took the mental ability test (based on the Moray House tests) was 87,498. They were between age 10 and 11. The tests covered general, spatial and numerical reasoning.&lt;ref name="Deary, et al., 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deary, Whiteman, Starr, Whalley, &amp; Fox, 2004"/&gt;

At mid-life period, a subset of the subjects participated in one of the studies, which were large health studies of adults and were carried out in Scotland in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Deary, et al., 2005"/&gt; The particular study they took part in was the collaborative study of 6022 men and 1006 women, conducted between 1970 and 1973 in Scotland. Participants completed a questionnaire (participant's address, father's occupation, the participant's own first regular occupation, the age of finishing full-time education, number of siblings, and if the participant was a regular car driver)  and attended a physical examination (measurement of height). Social class was coded according to the Registrar General's Classification for the participant's occupation at the time of screening, his first occupation and his father's occupation. Researchers separated into six social classes were used.&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office (1966). Classification of occupations 1966. London, UK7 HMSO.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[correlation]] and [[Structural equation modeling|structural equation model analysis]] was conducted.&lt;ref name="Deary, et al., 2005"/&gt; In the structural equation models, social status in the 1970s was the main outcome variable. The main contributors to education (and first social class) were father's social class and IQ at age 11, which was also found in a Scandinavian study.&lt;ref&gt;Sorjonen, K., Hemmingsson, T., Lundin, A., &amp; Melin, B. (2011). [https://www.academia.edu/download/42927175/How_social_position_of_origin_relates_to20160222-4894-xxuh2t.pdf How social position of origin relates to intelligence and level of education when adjusting for attained social position]. Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 277–281.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect was direct and also mediated via education and the participant's first job.&lt;ref name="Deary, et al., 2005"/&gt;

Participants at midlife did not necessarily end up in the same social class as their fathers.&lt;ref name="Deary, et al., 2005"/&gt; There was social mobility in the sample: 45% of men were upwardly mobile, 14% were downward mobile and 41% were socially stable. IQ at age 11 had a graded relationship with participant's social class. The same effect was seen for father's occupation. Men at midlife social class I and II (the highest, more professional) also had the highest IQ at age 11. Height at midlife, years of education and childhood IQ were significantly positively related to upward social mobility, while number of siblings had no significant effect. For each standard deviation increase in IQ score at the age 11, the chances of upward social mobility increases by 69% (with a 95% confidence). After controlling the effect of [[independent variables]], only IQ at age 11 was significantly inversely related to downward movement in social mobility. More years of education increase the chance that a father's son will surpass his social class, whereas low IQ makes a father's son prone to falling behind his father's social class.

[[File:Deary model02.png|thumbnail|right|Structural equation model of the direct and indirect influence of childhood position and IQ upon social status attainment at mid-life.All parameters significant (p&lt;.05)&lt;ref name="Deary, et al., 2005"/&gt;]]
Higher IQ at age 11 was also significantly related to higher social class at midlife, higher likelihood car driving at midlife, higher first social class, higher father's social class, fewer siblings, higher age of education, being taller and living in a less deprived neighbourhood at midlife.&lt;ref name="Deary, et al., 2005"/&gt; IQ was significantly more strongly related to the social class in midlife than the social class of the first job.

Finally, height, education and IQ at age 11 were predictors of upward social mobility and only IQ at age 11 and height were significant predictors of downward social mobility.&lt;ref name="Deary, et al., 2005"/&gt; Number of siblings was not significant in neither of the models.

Another research&lt;ref name="Johnson, Brett, &amp; Deary, 2010a"/&gt; looked into the pivotal role of education in association between ability and social class attainment through three generations (fathers, participants and offspring) using the SMS1932&lt;ref name="Deary, Whiteman, Starr, Whalley, &amp; Fox, 2004"/&gt; ([[Lothian birth-cohort studies#Lothian Birth Cohort Study 1921|Lothian Birth Cohort 1921]]) educational data, childhood ability and late life intellectual function data. It was proposed that social class of origin acts as a ballast&lt;ref name="Johnson, Brett, &amp; Deary, 2010a"/&gt; restraining otherwise meritocratic social class movement, and that education is the primary means through which social class movement is both restrained and facilitated—therefore acting in a pivotal role.

It was found that social class of origin predicts educational attainment in both the participant's and offspring generations.&lt;ref name="Johnson, Brett, &amp; Deary, 2010a"/&gt; Father's social class and participant's social class held the same importance in predicting offspring educational attainment—effect across two generations. Educational attainment mediated the association of social class attainments across generations (father's and participants social class, participant's and offspring's social class). There was no direct link social classes across generations, but in each generation educational attainment was a predictor of social class, which is consistent with other studies.&lt;ref name="Nettle, 2003"&gt;Nettle, D. (2003). Intelligence and class mobility in the British population. British Journal of Psychology, 551–561.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, L. F., Hodgson, S., Parker, L., &amp; Pearce, M. S. (2011). The influence of childhood IQ and education on social mobility in the Newcastle Thousand Families birth cohort. BMC Public Health, 11(1), 895.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, participant's childhood ability moderately predicted their educational and social class attainment (.31 and .38). Participant's educational attainment was strongly linked with the odds of moving downward or upward on the social class ladder. For each SD increase in education, the odds of moving upward on the social class spectrum were 2.58 times greater (the downward ones were .26 times greater). Offspring's educational attainment was also strongly linked with the odds of moving upward or downward on the social class ladder. For each SD increase in education, the odds of moving upward were 3.54 times greater (the downward ones were .40 times greater). In conclusion, education is very important, because it is the fundamental mechanism functioning both to hold individuals in their social class of origin and to make it possible for their movement upward or downward on the social class ladder.&lt;ref name="Johnson, Brett, &amp; Deary, 2010a"/&gt;

In the [[Lothian birth-cohort studies#Lothian Birth Cohort Study 1921|Cohort 1936]] it was found that regarding whole generations (not individuals)&lt;ref name="Johnson, Brett, &amp; Deary, 2010b"/&gt; the social mobility between father's and participant's generation is: 50.7% of the participant generation have moved upward in relation to their fathers, 22.1% had moved downwards, and 27.2% had remained stable in their social class. There was a lack of social mobility in the offspring generation as a whole. However, there was definitely individual offspring movement on the social class ladder: 31.4% had higher social class attainment than their participant parents (grandparents), 33.7% moved downward, and 33.9% stayed stable. Participant's childhood mental ability was linked to social class in all three generations. A very important pattern has also been confirmed: average years of education increased with social class and IQ.

There were some great contributors to social class attainment and social class mobility in the twentieth century: Both social class attainment and social mobility are influenced by pre-existing levels of mental ability,&lt;ref name="Johnson, Brett, &amp; Deary, 2010b"/&gt; which was in consistence with other studies.&lt;ref name="Nettle, 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waller, 1971"&gt;Waller, J. H. (1971). Achievement and Social Mobility: Relationships among IQ Score, Education, and Occupation in Two Generations. Social Biology, 252-259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young &amp; Gibson, 1963"&gt;Young, M., &amp; Gibson, J. (1963). In search of an explanation of social mobility. The British Journal of Statistical Psychology, 27-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burt, 1961"&gt;Burt, C. (1961). Intelligence and social mobility. The British Journal of Statistical Psychology, 1−24&lt;/ref&gt; So, the role of individual level mental ability in pursuit of educational attainment—professional positions require specific educational credentials. Furthermore, educational attainment contributes to social class attainment through the contribution of mental ability to educational attainment. Even further, mental ability can contribute to social class attainment independent of actual educational attainment, as in when the educational attainment is prevented, individuals with higher mental ability manage to make use of the mental ability to work their way up on the social ladder. This study made clear that intergenerational transmission of educational attainment is one of the key ways in which social class was maintained within family, and there was also evidence that education attainment was increasing over time. Finally, the results suggest that social mobility (moving upward and downward) has increased in recent years in Britain. Which according to one researcher  is important because an overall mobility of about 22% is needed to keep the distribution of intelligence relatively constant from one generation to the other within each occupational category.&lt;ref name="Burt, 1961"/&gt;

Researchers looked into the effects elitist and non-elitist education systems have on social mobility. Education policies are often critiqued based on their impact on a single generation, but it is important to look at education policies and the effects they have on social mobility. In the research, elitist schools are defined as schools that focus on providing its best students with the tools to succeed, whereas an egalitarian school is one that predicates itself on giving equal opportunity to all its students to achieve academic success.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cremer|first=Helmuth|last2=Donder|first2=Philippe De|last3=Pestieau|first3=Pierre|date=2010-08-01|title=Education and social mobility|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-010-9133-0|journal=International Tax and Public Finance|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=357–377|doi=10.1007/s10797-010-9133-0|issn=0927-5940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When private education supplements were not considered, it was found that the greatest amount of social mobility was derived from a system with the least elitist public education system. It was also discovered that the system with the most elitist policies produced the greatest amount of utilitarian welfare. Logically, social mobility decreases with more elitist education systems and utilitarian welfare decreases with less elitist public education policies.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

When private education supplements are introduced, it becomes clear that some elitist policies promote some social mobility and that an egalitarian system is the most successful at creating the maximum amount of welfare. These discoveries were justified from the reasoning that elitist education systems discourage skilled workers from supplementing their children's educations with private expenditures.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

The authors of the report showed that they can challenge conventional beliefs that elitist and regressive educational policy is the ideal system. This is explained as the researchers found that education has multiple benefits. It brings more productivity and has a value, which was a new thought for education. This shows that the arguments for the regressive model should not be without qualifications. Furthermore, in the elitist system, the effect of earnings distribution on growth is negatively impacted due to the polarizing social class structure with individuals at the top with all the capital and individuals at the bottom with nothing.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Education is very important in determining the outcome of one's future. It is almost impossible to achieve upward mobility without education. Education is frequently seen as a strong driver of social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/social-mobility-and-education|title=Social Mobility and Education {{!}} The Equality Trust|website=www.equalitytrust.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of one's education varies depending on the social class that they are in. The higher the family income the better opportunities one is given to get a good education. The inequality in education makes it harder for low-income families to achieve social mobility. Research has indicated that inequality is connected to the deficiency of social mobility. In a period of growing inequality and low social mobility, fixing the quality of and access to education has the possibility to increase equality of opportunity for all Americans.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/thirteen-economic-facts-about-social-mobility-and-the-role-of-education/|title=Thirteen Economic Facts about Social Mobility and the Role of Education {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2013-06-26|work=Brookings|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"One significant consequence of growing income inequality is that, by historical standards, high-income households are spending much more on their children's education than low-income households."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; With the lack of total income, low-income families can't afford to spend money on their children's education. Research has shown that over the past few years, families with high income has increased their spending on their children's education. High income families were paying $3,500 per year and now it has increased up to nearly $9,000, which is seven times more than what low income families pay for their kids' education.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The increase in money spent on education has caused an increase in college graduation rates for the families with high income. The increase in graduation rates is causing an even bigger gap between high income children and low-income children. Given the significance of a college degree in today's labor market, rising differences in college completion signify rising differences in outcomes in the future.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Family income is one of the most important factors in determining the mental ability(intelligence) of their children. With such bad education that urban school are offering, parents of high income are moving out of these areas to give their children a better opportunity to succeed. As urban school systems worsen, high income families move to rich suburbs because that is where they feel better education is; if they do stay in the city, they put their children to private schools.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bell Curve: intelligence and Class Structure in American Life|last=Herrnstein|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Herrnstein|publisher=Free Press|year=1994|isbn=0-02-914673-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low income families don't have a choice but to settle for the bad education because they cannot afford to relocate to rich suburbs. The more money and time parents invest in their child plays a huge role in determining their success in school. Research has showed that higher mobility levels are perceived for locations where there are better schools.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18160">'''Teleonomy''' is the quality of apparent purposefulness and goal-directedness of structures and functions in living organisms brought about by the exercise, augmentation, and, improvement of reasoning. The term derives from two [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words, τέλος ''telos'' ("end, purpose") and νόμος ''nomos'' ("law"), and means "end-directed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/Mayr3.pdf |title=The Multiple Meanings of "Teleological" |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |date=1974 |journal=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; (literally "purpose-law"). Teleonomy is sometimes contrasted with [[teleology in biology|teleology]], where the latter is understood as a purposeful goal-directedness brought about through human or divine intention. Teleonomy is thought to derive from [[evolution]]ary history, adaptation for reproductive success, and/or the operation of a program.  Teleonomy is related to programmatic or computational aspects of purpose.

== Relationship with teleology ==
{{further|Teleology in biology}}

[[Colin Pittendrigh]], who coined the term in 1958, applied it to biological phenomena that appear to be end-directed, hoping to limit the much older term [[teleology in biology|teleology]] to actions planned by an agent who can internally model alternative futures with [[intention]], purpose and foresight:
{{quote|Biologists for a while were prepared to say a turtle came ashore and laid its eggs. These verbal scruples were intended as a rejection of teleology but were based on the mistaken view that the efficiency of final causes is necessarily implied by the simple description of an end-directed mechanism. … The biologists long-standing confusion would be removed if all end-directed systems were described by some other term, e.g., 'teleonomic', in order to emphasize that recognition and description of end-directedness does not carry a commitment to Aristotelian teleology as an efficient causal principle.&lt;ref&gt;Pittendrigh, C. S.  "Adaptation, natural selection, and behavior", in ''Behavior and Evolution'', ed. A. Roe and [[George Gaylord Simpson]], New Haven: Yale University Press, 1958, 390–416; p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1965 [[Ernst Mayr]] cited Pittendrigh and criticized him for not making a "clear distinction between the two teleologies of Aristotle"; evolution involves Aristotle's [[material cause]]s and [[formal cause]]s rather than [[efficient cause]]s.&lt;ref name="causeandeffect"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |chapter=Cause and effect in biology |editor=Lerner, D. |title=Cause and effect |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |date=1965 |pages=33–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayr adopted Pittendrigh's term, but supplied his own definition:{{quote|It would seem useful to rigidly restrict the term ''teleonomic'' to systems operating on the basis of a program of coded information. (p.42)}}

[[Richard Dawkins]] described the properties of "archeo-purpose" (by natural selection) and "neo-purpose" (by evolved adaptation) in his talk on the "Purpose of Purpose". Dawkins attributes the brain's flexibility as an evolutionary feature in adapting or subverting goals to making neo-purpose goals on an overarching evolutionary archeo-purpose. Language allows groups to share neo-purposes, and cultural evolution - occurring much faster than natural evolution - can lead to conflict or collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.richarddawkins.net/videos/3956-the-purpose-of-purpose |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121222125/http://old.richarddawkins.net/videos/3956-the-purpose-of-purpose |archivedate=2014-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[behavior analysis]], Hayne Reese made the [[adverbial]] distinction between purposefulness (having an internal determination) and purposiveness (serving or effecting a useful function).  Reese implies that non-teleological statements are called teleonomic when they represent an "if A then C" phenomenon's [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]; where, teleology is a [[consequent]] representation. The concept of purpose, as only being the teleology final cause, requires supposedly impossible [[Temporal paradox|time reversal]]; because, the future consequent determines the present antecedent.  Purpose, as being both in the beginning and the end, simply rejects teleology, and addresses the time reversal problem. In this, Reese sees no value for teleology and teleonomic concepts in behavior analysis; however, the concept of purpose preserved in process can be useful, if not reified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2733687/pdf/behavan00023-0077.pdf | title=Teleology and Teleonomy in Behavior Analysis | author=Reese, Hayne W. | journal=The Behavior Analyst | date=1994 | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=75–91 | pmc=2733687 | pmid=22478174}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical time-dimensional tunneling and teleological functioning of [[temporal paradox]] would also fit this description without the necessity of a localized intelligence.  Whereas the concept of a teleonomic process, such as [[evolution]], can simply refer to a system capable of producing complex products without the benefit of a guiding foresight.

In 1966 [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] approved of the term in the last chapter of his ''Adaptation and Natural Selection; a critique of some current evolutionary thought''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Williams, G.C. |title=Adaptation and natural selection; a critique of some current evolutionary thought |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton, NJ |date=1966 |isbn=0-691-02615-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, [[Jacques Monod]], in ''[[Chance and Necessity]], an Essay on the Natural Philosophy of Modern Biology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Monod, Jacques |title=Chance and Necessity: An Essay on the Natural Philosophy of Modern Biology |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]] |location=New York |date=1971 |isbn=0-394-46615-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested teleonomy as a key feature that defines life:

{{quote|Rather than reject this [goal-directedness] idea (as certain biologists have tried to do) it is indispensable to recognise that it is essential to the very definition of living beings. We shall maintain that the latter are distinct from all other structures or systems present in the universe through this characteristic property, which we shall call teleonomy.
[..] It will be readily seen that, in this or that species situated higher or lower on the animal scale, the achievement of the fundamental teleonomic project (i.e., invariant reproduction) calls assorted, more or less elaborate and complex structures and performances into play. The fact must be stressed that concerned here are not only the activities directly bound up with reproduction itself, but all those that contribute-be it very indirectly-to the species' survival and multiplication. For example, in higher mammals the play of the young is an important element of psychic development and social integration. Therefore this activity has teleonomic value, inasmuch as it furthers the cohesion of the group, a condition for its survival and for the expansion of the species.}}

In 1974 Ernst Mayr illustrated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayr, E. |title=Teleological and Teleonomic, a New Analysis |journal=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science |volume=14 |date=1974 |doi=10.1007/978-94-009-5345-1_10 |pages=133–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; the difference in the statements:

:: "The Wood Thrush migrates in the fall '''in order to escape''' the inclemency of the weather and the food shortages of the northern climates."

:: "The Wood Thrush migrates in the fall '''and thereby escapes''' the inclemency of the weather and the food shortages of the northern climates."

{{quote|If we replace the words ‘in order to escape’ by ‘and thereby escapes’, we leave the important question unanswered as to why the Wood Thrush migrates. The teleonomic form of the statement implies that the goal-directed migratory activity is governed by a program. By omitting this important message the second sentence is greatly impoverished as far as information content is concerned, without gaining in causal strength.}}

Subsequently, philosophers like [[Ernest Nagel]] further analysed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2025745 |author=Nagel, E. |title=Teleology Revisited: Goal-Directed Processes in Biology |jstor=2025745 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=261–301 |date=1977 }} Reprinted in Allen, Bekoff &amp; Lauder, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of goal-directedness in biology and by 1982, philosopher and historian of science [[David Hull]] joked&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hull, D.L. |chapter=Philosophy and Biology |title=Philosophy of Science |pages=280–316 |volume=2 |editor=Fløistad, Guttorm |editor-link=Guttorm Fløistad |series=Contemporary Philosophy: A New Survey |publisher=Nijhoff |location=Hague |date=1982 |isbn=90-247-2518-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about the use of teleology and teleonomy by biologists:

{{quote|Haldane [in the 1930s] can be found remarking, ‘Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he’s unwilling to be seen with her in public.’ Today the mistress has become a lawfully wedded wife. Biologists no longer feel obligated to apologize for their use of teleological language; they flaunt it. The only concession which they make to its disreputable past is to rename it ‘teleonomy’.}}

==Relationship to evolution==

The concept of teleonomy was largely developed by Mayr and Pittendrigh to separate biological evolution from teleology.  Pittendrigh's purpose was to enable biologists who had become overly cautious about goal-oriented language to have a way of discussing the goals and orientations of an organism's behaviors without inadvertently invoking teleology.  Mayr was even more explicit, saying that while teleonomy certainly operates on the level of organisms, the process of evolution itself is necessarily non-teleonomic.

{{quote|Mayr says, 'The existence of complex codes of information in the DNA of the germ plasm permits teleonomic purposiveness. On the other hand, evolutionary research has found no evidence whatsoever for a "goal-seeking" of evolutionary lines, as postulated in that kind of teleology which sees "plan and design" in nature. The harmony of the living universe, so far as it exists, is an a posteriori product of natural selection.&lt;ref name="causeandeffect" /&gt;}} This attitude towards the role of teleonomy in the evolutionary process is the consensus view of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3998/ptb.6959004.0002.003 |author=Merlin, F. |title=Evolutionary Chance Mutation: A Defense of the Modern Synthesis’ Consensus View |journal=Philosophy, Theory, and Practice in Biology |volume=2 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolution largely hoards [[hindsight]], as variations unwittingly make "predictions" about structures and functions which could successfully cope with the future, and which participate in a process of natural selection that culls the unfit, leaving the fit to the next generation.  Information accumulates about functions and structures that are successful, exploiting [[feedback]] from the environment via the selection of fitter coalitions of structures and functions. [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] has described these features as an [[anticipatory system]] which builds an internal model based on past and possible future states.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In 1962, Grace A. de Laguna's "The Role of Teleonomy in Evolution" attempted to show how different stages of evolution were characterized by different types of teleonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/287855 |author=de Laguna |author2=Grace A. |title=The Role of Teleonomy in Evolution |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=117–131 |date=April 1962 |jstor=186539}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Laguna points out that humans have oriented teleonomy so that the teleonomic goal is not restricted to the reproduction of humans, but also to cultural ideals.

In recent years, a few biologists believe that the separation of teleonomy from the process of evolution has gone too far.  [[Peter Corning]] notes that behavior, which is a teleonomic trait, is responsible for the construction of biological niches, which is an agent of selection.  Therefore, it would be inaccurate to say that there was no role for teleonomy in the process of evolution, since teleonomy dictates the fitness landscape according to which organisms are selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/bij.12061 |author=Corning, P. |title=Evolution ‘on purpose’: how behaviour has shaped the evolutionary process |journal=Journal of the Linnaean Society |volume=112 |pages=242–260 |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holmes, B. |title=Life’s purpose: Can animals guide their own evolution? |journal=New Scientist |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corning calls this phenomenon "teleonomic selection".

==Philosophy==
In teleology, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s positions as expressed in [[Critique of Judgment]], were neglected for many years because in the minds of many scientists they were associated with [[Vitalism|vitalist]] views of evolution. Their recent rehabilitation is evident in teleonomy, which bears a number of features, such as the description of organisms, that are reminiscent of the Aristotelian conception of [[final cause]]s as essentially recursive in nature. Kant's position is that, even though we cannot know whether there are final causes in nature, we are constrained by the peculiar nature of the human understanding to view organisms teleologically. Thus the Kantian view sees teleology as a necessary principle for the study of organisms, but only as a regulative principle, and with no ontological implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Purpose |last=Huneman |first=Philippe |date=2007 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |isbn= 1-58046-265-0 |pages= 1–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Talcott Parsons]], in the later part of his working with a theory of [[social evolution]] and a related theory of world-history, adopted the concept of teleonomy as the fundamental organizing principle for directional processes and his theory of [[social development|societal development]] in general. In this way, Parsons tried to find a theoretical compromise between [[Voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]] as a principle of action and the idea of a certain directionality in history.

==Current status==
Teleonomy is closely related to concepts of [[emergence]], [[Complex systems|complexity theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00128784 |author=Christensen, W.D. |title=A complex systems theory of teleology |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=11 |pages=301–320 |date=1996 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/N065P12442750447.pdf |format=PDF |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[self-organizing systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0301-4622(87)80031-5 |author=Lifson S |title=Chemical selection, diversity, teleonomy and the second law of thermodynamics.

==Plot==
Tom Sherbourne, a [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|traumatised and withdrawn]] hero of [[World War I]], is hired as a [[lighthouse keeper|lightkeeper]] at Janus Rock, a lighthouse off the coast of [[Western Australia]]. He falls in love with a local girl, Isabel Graysmark, and they marry in 1921. Isabel loses two pregnancies in three years and fears she may never become a mother.

Shortly after Isabel's second [[miscarriage]], a rowboat containing a dead man and a newborn baby girl washes ashore near the lighthouse. Tom knows that regulations require him to report the discovery. However, Isabel fears that the baby will almost certainly be sent to an [[orphanage]] and persuades Tom to pass the baby off as their own. Tom grudgingly agrees. He buries the man on the island, and the couple names the girl Lucy.

As Tom and Isabel are about to have Lucy [[Infant baptism|christened]] on the mainland, Tom sees a woman, Hannah Roennfeldt, kneeling in front of a grave bearing the names of Frank Roennfeldt and his baby daughter Grace Ellen, who were lost at sea on the day they found Lucy, 26 April 1923. Tom fears that Lucy might very well be Hannah's missing daughter. He writes anonymously to Hannah to tell her that her husband is dead but that her baby is safe and well cared-for.

Four years later, Tom, Isabel, and Lucy, who have enjoyed an idyllic life together, attend a ceremony for the anniversary of Tom's lighthouse, and they strike up a conversation with Hannah and her sister, Gwen Potts. They learn that Frank was a German, that Hannah's marrying him so soon after the First World War was controversial, and that he had been accosted in the street by a drunken crowd. He jumped into a rowboat and fled with his baby daughter. 

Tormented by his conscience, Tom sends Hannah a small rattle that was found with Lucy on the boat. One of Tom's co-workers recognizes the rattle on a reward poster and reports him to the police.

Tom takes full responsibility, claiming he bullied Isabel into complying. Isabel is enraged that Tom is willing to give Lucy away and breaks off contact with him after his arrest.  Lucy is returned to her birth family but initially rejects and hates them, having no memory of them. She refuses to answer to "Grace" and even runs away in an effort to return to the lighthouse.

The police accuse Tom of murdering Frank and are unable to draw an answer from the distraught Isabel as to whether or not Frank was dead when they discovered him. Lucy runs away to look for the lighthouse, and a search team is sent to rescue her. She is found and returned to Hannah, but the events lead Hannah to realize that Lucy now belongs to Isabel. 

Hannah promises to return Lucy to Isabel as soon as Isabel testifies against Tom. Just as Tom is about to be taken by boat to [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] for trial, Isabel reads a letter which Tom had sent her, confiding he had not deserved his happiness with Lucy and how carrying the blame will assuage his [[survivor guilt|guilt for surviving the war]]. 

Isabel jumps on the boat and confesses everything. Moved by their gesture and reminded by Frank's words to always forgive others, Hannah offers to speak on their behalf at trial. Lucy has at last begun to bond with her biological mother and grandfather, who agrees to call her "Lucy-Grace" as a compromise.

In 1950, an adult Lucy-Grace Rutherford, accompanied by her baby son Christopher, tracks Tom down. She has not been in contact with the Sherbournes for over twenty years, as they had agreed not to contact her for the rest of her childhood. Isabel has recently died, still tormented with guilt for her actions, and Tom gives Lucy-Grace a letter that Isabel had written in case Lucy ever made contact. An emotional Lucy-Grace thanks Tom, the only father she knew, for rescuing and raising her for the few years on Janus, and she asks if she can visit again. She and Tom embrace before she leaves.

The '''timeline of racial tension in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]''' lists events in [[African-American]] history in Omaha.  These included racial violence, but also include many firsts as the African-American community built its institutions.  Omaha has been a major industrial city on the edge of what was a rural, agricultural state.  It has attracted a more diverse population than the rest of the state. Its issues were common to other major industrial cities of the early 20th century, as it was a  destination for 19th and 20th century [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants, and internal white and African-American migrants from [[Southern United States|the South]] in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Many early 20th century conflicts arose out of labor struggles, postwar social tensions and economic problems, and hiring of later immigrants and black migrants as [[strikebreakers]] in the [[meatpacking]] and stockyard industries. Massive job losses starting in the 1960s with the restructuring of the railroad, stockyards and meatpacking industries contributed to economic and social problems for workers in the city.

== 1950 to 2000 ==

According to several prominent Omaha historians, [[racial discrimination]] was a significant issue in Omaha from the 1950s through the 2000s (decade). Analyzing [[race relations]] in Omaha during the period they commented, "1968 rivals 1919 as probably the worst year in the history of twentieth-century America from the standpoint of violence and internal tension."&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Cotrell, Dalhstrom and Dalhstrom. (2007) ''Upstream Metropolis: An urban biography of Omaha and Council Bluffs.'' University of Nebraska Press. p 361.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 three days of rioting swept the [[Near North Side (Omaha, Nebraska)|Near North Side]], and in 1970 a policeman was killed by a suitcase bomb while answering a disturbance call at a house in [[North Omaha]]. However, as the 1966 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated documentary ''[[A Time for Burning]]'' and the 1970s books of [[Lois Mark Stalvey]] illustrated, the violence apparently served a purpose as lines of communication were opened between the "[[West Omaha]] matron and the black laborer."&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Cotrell, Dalhstrom and Dalhstrom. (2007) p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Unfolding Object''''' is a 2002 work of [[internet art]] created by [[John Simon (artist)|John Simon]] after a commission from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]].  Along with ''[[net.flag]]'' by [[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]], it was among the first pieces of internet art to be collected by a major museum.

Simon has described ''Unfolding Object'' as "an endless book that rewrites itself and whose use dictates its content."  It begins as a blank square visible on a web page hosted on the museum's [[website]], but responds when clicked by visitors to the site.  Gradually the square unfolds, click by click, until it reaches a certain point, after which it begins to close.  The "pages" of the design are programmed to respond differently as they receive more clicks; vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines denote different numbers of previous clicks.  The colors of the square and of its background are both programmed to change hourly.

The '''United South End Settlements''' (USES) consist of four settlement houses, founded as part of the [[Settlement movement]] to provide services such as daycare, education, and healthcare to improve the lives of the poor, and a children's museum dating back to 1891.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Note|url=http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m126findprint.htm}} ''Archives and Special Collections Finding Aids: United South End Settlements.'' Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections. Web. Retrieved 19 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  With their slogan of "neighbors helping neighbors since 1891", the United South End Settlements continues to serve Boston's [[South End, Boston|South End]] and [[Lower Roxbury Historic District|Lower Roxbury]] community today.&lt;ref name=USES&gt;{{cite web|title=United South End Settlements|url=http://www.uses.org/|website=United South End Settlements|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; USES has grown and evolved over time to remain relevant to the South End.&lt;ref name="USES History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.uses.org/about-us/history/|website=United South End Settlements|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The history of USES began in 1891 when William J. Tucker founded what was to become known as the South End House at 6 Rollins Street.&lt;ref name="NEU Finding Aid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m126findprint.htm}} ''Archives and Special Collections Finding Aids: United South End Settlements.'' Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections. Web. Retrieved 19 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The South End House would be the first of its kind "in Boston and the fourth one in the United States."&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; Before the incorporation of the final five organizations into USES, the Federation of South End Settlements was formed in 1950.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; The Federation of South End Settlements was made up of the South End House, Lincoln House (1892), Hale House (1895), [[Harriet Tubman]] House (1904), Ellis Memorial House, and Eldridge House. This federation was founded in order to create a larger pool of funds for the organizations to share.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; Eventually the Ellis Memorial and Eldridge Houses would disassociate themselves in 1959, and the four remaining houses and the Children's Art Centre would unite to become the United South End Settlements in January 1960.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt;

USES originally focused on providing services to "[improve] housing, public health, and sanitation, developing day care programs that included medical care for children, and creating mental health programs."&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; Specifically, USES' "residents established milk stations, public baths, dispensaries, and services, such as emergency loan and stamp savings programs"&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; USES also founded "specialized schools for industrial, vocational, and employment training for both women and men" to create more opportunity in the South End neighborhood.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; Culture and arts were not forgotten in the South End either as USES provided "free concerts, art exhibitions, reading rooms, and a variety of social, drama, and literary clubs" for its residents. As of 2014, USES still provides many of the same services that it has all along, incorporating the technology of today into its programs and curriculums for the residents of the South End and Lower Roxbury community.&lt;ref name= "USES" /&gt;

==Programs==
* '''After School Program'''
: 52 children, aged 5–12 years, are accepted into the USES After School Program. The program's mission is to "support school success and promote the social, cognitive, and emotional development of the students."&lt;ref name=ASP&gt;{{cite web|title=After School Program|url=http://www.uses.org/programs/asp/|website=United South End Settlements|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program runs the full year while school is in session, and during summer and vacation days.&lt;ref name= "ASP" /&gt;

Camp Hale was founded on the principle that "all youth, particularly those from urban environments, will benefit from challenging opportunities for physical, mental, and social growth and development."&lt;ref name= "CH" /&gt;
* '''Children's Art Centre'''
: The Children's Art Centre offers three annual events and five programs to youth ages 3 months to 15 years.

* '''[[Thrive in 5]]'''
: This "school readiness" program was established in 2010 by the [[United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Merrimack Valley]] and [[Thomas M. Menino]].&lt;ref name="USES Thrive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thrive in 5|url=http://www.uses.org/programs/thrive-in-5/|website=United South End Settlements|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thrive in 5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Children Thrive|url=http://thrivein5boston.org/bostonchildrenthrive/|website=Thrive in 5 Boston|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; USES acts of the hub of [[Thrive in 5]] for the South End and Lower Roxbury neighborhood.&lt;ref name="USES Thrive" /&gt;

      <comment>The quote attributed to Steven Robiner lacks evidence for its existence. I find it strange that someone totally unrelated to serious philosophy would make such a claim. After "extensive research" (I spent about 2 hours looking for valid sources) i concluded that this quote is bogus because all the references i could find either didn't had any sources or the only source was wikipedia itself. It looks like this is a fallacious circular reference since all the sources in this section aren't valid.</comment>

In philosophy, '''universality''' is the idea that universal facts exist and can be progressively discovered, as opposed to [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonnett, A. (2005). Anti-racism. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In certain theologies, [[universalism]] is the quality ascribed to an entity whose existence is consistent throughout the universe, whose being is independent of and unconstrained by the events and conditions that compose the universe, such as entropy and physical locality. 

This article also discusses [[Kantianism|Kantian]] and [[Platonism|Platonist]] notions of "[[universal (metaphysics)|universal]]", which are considered by most philosophers to be separate notions.

==Universality in ethics==
{{main|Moral universalism}}
When used in the context of ethics, the meaning of ''universal'' refers to that which is true for "all similarly situated individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/u.htm|title=Philosophical Dictionary: Ubermensch-Utilitarianism|author=|date=|website=www.philosophypages.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820235357/http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/u.htm|archivedate=2007-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rights]], for example in [[natural rights]], or in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], for those heavily influenced by the philosophy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its conception of a [[human nature]], could be considered universal. The 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is inspired by such principles.

==Universality in logic==
In logic, or the consideration of valid arguments, a [[proposition]] is said to have universality if it can be conceived as being true in all possible contexts without creating a [[contradiction]]. Some philosophers have referred to such propositions as [[universalizability|universalizable]]. A [[truth]] is considered to be universal if it is logically valid (logical) in and also beyond all times and places. Hence a universal truth is considered logically to transcend the state of the physical universe, whose order is derived from such truths. In this case, such a truth is seen as [[eternity|eternal]] or as absolute. The patterns and relations expressed by [[mathematics]] in ways that are consistent with the fields of logic and mathematics are typically considered truths of universal scope. This is not to say that universality is limited to mathematics, since it is also used in philosophy, theology, and other pursuits.

The [[relativism|relativist conception]] denies the existence of some or all universal truths, particularly ethical ones (as [[moral relativism]]). Though usage of the word ''truth'' has various domains of application, relativism does not necessarily apply to all of them.

==Universality in metaphysics==
{{See also|Universal (metaphysics)}}

In [[metaphysics]], a '''universal''' is a [[type (metaphysics)|type]], a [[property (metaphysics)|property]], or a [[relation (metaphysics)|relation]]. The noun ''universal'' contrasts with ''[[individual]]'', while the adjective ''universal'' contrasts with ''[[particular]]'' or sometimes with ''[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]]''. The latter meaning, however, may be confusing since [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegelian]] and [[neo-Hegelian]] (e.g. [[British idealism|British idealist]]) philosophies speak of ''[[concrete universal]]s''.

A universal may have instances, known as its ''particulars''. For example, the type ''dog'' (or ''doghood'') is a universal, as are the property ''red'' (or ''redness'') and the relation ''betweenness'' (or ''being between''). Any particular dog, red thing, or object that is between other things is not a universal, however, but is an ''instance'' of a universal. That is, a universal type (''doghood''), property (''redness''), or relation (''betweenness'') ''[[Substance theory#Inherence|inheres]]'' a particular object (a specific dog, red thing, or object between other things).

[[Platonic realism]] holds universals to be the [[referent]]s of general terms, i.e. the ''[[abstraction|abstract]]'', nonphysical entities to which words like "doghood", "redness", and "betweenness" refer. By contrast, particulars are the referents of proper names, like "Fido", or of definite descriptions that identify single objects, like the phrase, "that apple on the table". By contrast, other metaphysical theories merely use the terminology of universals to describe physical entities.

''The [[problem of universals]]'' is an ancient problem in metaphysics concerning the nature of universals, or whether they exist. Part of the problem involves the implications of language use and the complexity of relating language to [[ontology|ontological]] theory.

Universal truth is regarded as ontic, i.e. expressing the order of being itself. A universal truth is epistemic only to the extent that its ontic expression is apprehended or discerned in a veridical way, which cannot affect its being in any case. Most ontological frameworks do not consider [[class (philosophy)|classes]] to be universals, although some prominent philosophers, such as John Bigelow, do.

The '''World Health Organisation Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)''' is a structured interview for psychiatric disorders. As the interview is designed for [[epidemiological studies]], it can be administered by those who are not clinically trained and can be completed in a short amount of time. Versions of the CIDI were used in two important studies, the [[National Comorbidity Survey]] (NCS)&lt;ref name="NCS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blazer |first1=DG |last2=Kessler |first2=RC |last3=McGonagle |first3=KA |last4=Swartz |first4=MS |name-list-format=vanc |date=July 1994 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/151/7/979 |url-access=subscription |title=The prevalence and distribution of major depression in a national community sample: The National Comorbidity Survey |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=151 |issue=7 |pages=979-86 |pmid=8010383 |doi=10.1176/ajp.151.7.979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

 2) Add&lt;ref name="TheSun_Dec9"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to the body of the article, where you want the new footnote.
 3) Put the reference information (template, mere URL, plain text, e.g.) in between &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name="TheSun_Dec9"&gt; and 

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
 4) It will appear in the references section immediately PROVIDED YOU HAVE TYPED EVERYTHING CORRECTLY. There is no need to type 

anything down here.
 5) Multiple footnotes to the same reference will work if you type out, "&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name="TheSun_Dec9"/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;", again 

without the nowiki tags.
