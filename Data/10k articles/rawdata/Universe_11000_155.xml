'''Idaho Proposition 2''' was a 2006 [[ballot initiative]] in the state of [[Idaho]], U.S. that aimed to force government to reimburse property owners whose property value is decreased as a result of government regulation.

The initiative, which is similar to the controversial [[Oregon Ballot Measure 37 (2004)]], was defeated. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idsos.state.id.us/ELECT/RESULTS/2006/general/tot_stwd.htm 2006 General Results statewide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213205346/http://www.idsos.state.id.us/elect/RESULTS/2006/general/tot_stwd.htm |date=2006-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

===Spain===
On the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the construction of [[motillas]]-type settlements in the period after 2200 BC is believed to be the consequence of the severe [[aridification]] that affected this area.

According to Moreno et al., who reported the first [[Historical geology|palaeohydrogeological]] interdisciplinary research in [[La Mancha]], Spain,
{{quote|Recent studies show that the "motilla" sites from the Bronze Age in La Mancha may be the most ancient system of groundwater collection in the Iberian Peninsula. ... These were built during the Climatic Event 4.2 ka cal BP in a time of environmental stress due to a period of severe, prolonged drought.&lt;ref&gt;Mejías Moreno, M., Benítez de Lugo Enrich, L., Pozo Tejado, J. del y Moraleda Sierra, J. 2014. [http://www.igme.es/boletin/2014/125_4/5_%20Articulo%203.pdf ''Los primeros aprovechamientos de aguas subterráneas en la Península Ibérica. Las motillas de Daimiel en la Edad del Bronce de La Mancha''.] Boletín Geológico y Minero, 125 (4): 455–474 {{ISSN|0366-0176}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The authors' analysis verified a relationship between the geological substrate and the spatial distribution of the motillas.

===Ancient Egypt===
In c. 2150&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] was hit by a series of exceptionally low [[Nile]] [[Flooding of the Nile|floods]]. This may have influenced the collapse of centralised government in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stanley, Jean-Daniel | year = 2003 | title = Nile flow failure at the end of the Old Kingdom, Egypt: Strontium isotopic and petrologic evidence | journal = Geoarchaeology | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 395–402 | doi = 10.1002/gea.10065 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary texts claim that famines, social disorder and fragmentation subsequently occurred. 

===Arabian peninsula===
In the [[Persian Gulf]] region, there is a sudden change in settlement pattern, style of pottery and tombs at this time. The 22nd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE drought marks the end of the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm al-Nar Culture]] and the change to the [[Wadi Suq culture]].&lt;ref name="Parker2006" /&gt;

===Mesopotamia===
The [[aridification]] of [[Mesopotamia]] may have been related to the onset of cooler sea-surface temperatures in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] (Bond event 3), as analysis of the modern instrumental record shows that large (50%) interannual reductions in Mesopotamian water supply result when subpolar northwest Atlantic sea surface temperatures are anomalously cool.&lt;ref name="Cullen2000"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Cullen | first = Heidi M. |author2= deMenocal, Peter B. | year = 2000 | title = North Atlantic influence on Tigris-Euphrates streamflow | journal = International Journal of Climatology | volume = 20 | issue = 8 | pages = 853–863 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0088(20000630)20:8&lt;853::AID-JOC497&gt;3.0.CO;2-M|bibcode = 2000IJCli..20..853C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The headwaters of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] Rivers are fed by elevation-induced capture of winter [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] rainfall.

The [[Akkadian Empire]], in 2300&amp;nbsp;BCE, was the second civilisation to subsume independent societies into a single state (the first being [[ancient Egypt]] around 3100&amp;nbsp;BCE). It has been claimed that the collapse of the state was influenced by a wide-ranging, centuries-long drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kerr, Richard A. | year = 1998 | title = Sea-Floor Dust Shows Drought Felled Akkadian Empire | journal = Science | volume = 279 | issue = 5349 | pages = 325–326 | doi = 10.1126/science.279.5349.325 |bibcode = 1998Sci...279..325K}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Cullen, H.

Around 2150&amp;nbsp;BCE, the [[Gutian people]], who originally inhabited the [[Zagros Mountains]], defeated the demoralised Akkadian army, took [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], and destroyed it around 2115&amp;nbsp;BCE. Widespread agricultural change in the Near East is visible at the end of the 3rd&amp;nbsp;millennium&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Riehl, S. | year = 2008 | title = Climate and agriculture in the ancient Near East: a synthesis of the archaeobotanical and stable carbon isotope evidence | journal = Vegetation History and Archaeobotany | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–51 | doi = 10.1007/s00334-008-0156-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resettlement of the northern plains by smaller sedentary populations occurred near 1900&amp;nbsp;BCE, three centuries after the collapse.&lt;ref name="Weiss1993" /&gt;

===South central Asia and India===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5079">A ''' Block and bleed manifold''' is a [[hydraulic manifold]] that combines one or more block/isolate [[hydraulic valve|valves]], usually [[ball valve]]s, and one or more bleed/vent valves, usually ball or [[needle valve]]s, into one component for interface with other components (pressure measurement transmitters, [[Gauge (engineering)|gauge]]s, [[switch]]es, etc.) of a [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] ([[fluid]]) system.  The purpose of the block and bleed manifold is to isolate or block the flow of fluid in the system so the fluid from upstream of the manifold does not reach other components of the system that are downstream. Then they bleed off or vent the remaining fluid from the system on the downstream side of the manifold.  For example, a block and bleed manifold would be used to stop the flow of fluids to some component, then vent the fluid from that component’s side of the manifold, in order to effect some kind of work (maintenance/repair/replacement) on that component.

== Types of valves ==

=== Block and Bleed ===
A block and bleed manifold with one block valve and one bleed valve is also known as an '''[[isolation valve]]''' or '''block and bleed valve'''; a block and bleed manifold with multiple valves is also known as an '''isolation manifold'''. This valve is used in combustible gas trains in many industrial applications. Block and bleed needle valves are used in hydraulic and pneumatic systems because the needle valve allows for precise flow regulation when there is low flow in a non-hazardous environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Needle Valves {{!}} Needle Valve Master Distributor - Hy-Lok USA|url = http://www.hylokusa.com/products/valves/needle-valves/|website = Hy-lok USA|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Double Block and Bleed (DBB Valves) ===
These valves replace existing traditional techniques employed by pipeline engineers to generate a double block and bleed configuration in the pipeline. Two block valves and a bleed valve are as a unit, or manifold, to be installed for positive isolation. Used for critical process service, DBB valves are for high pressure systems or toxic/hazardous fluid processes. Applications that use DBB valves include instrument drain, chemical injection connection, chemical seal isolation, and gauge isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Double Block &amp; Bleed Valves - Hy-Lok USA|url = http://www.hylokusa.com/double-block-bleed-valves/|website = Hy-lok USA|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; DBB valves do the work of three separate valves (2 isolations and 1 drain) and require less space and have less weight.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Introduction to Valves - Only the Basics - - Introduction to block &amp; bleed Valves and block &amp; bleed systems -|url = http://www.wermac.org/valves/valves_dbb.html|website = www.wermac.org|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cartridge Type Standard Length DBB ===
This type of Double Block and Bleed Valves have a patented design which incorporates two ball valves and a bleed valve into one compact cartridge type unit with ANSI B16.5 tapped flanged connections. The major benefit of this design configuration is that the valve has the same face-to-face dimension as a single block ball valve (as specified in API 6D and ANSI B16.10), which means the valve can easily be installed into an existing pipeline without the need for any pipeline re-working.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

=== Three Piece Non Standard Length DBB ===
This type of Double Block and Bleed Valves (DBB Valves) feature the traditional style of flange-by-flange type valve and is available with ANSI B16.5 flanges, hub connections and welded ends to suit the pipeline system it is to be installed in. It features all the benefits of the single unit DBB valve, with the added benefit of a bespoke face-to-face dimension if required.

=== Single Unit DBB ===
This design also has operational advantages, there are significantly fewer potential leak paths within the double block and bleed section of the pipeline. Because the valves are full bore with an uninterrupted flow orifice they have got a negligible pressure drop across the unit. The pipelines where these valves are installed can also be pigged without any problems.

There are several advantages in using a Double Block and Bleed Valve. Significantly, because all the valve components are housed in a single unit, the space required for the installation is dramatically reduced thus freeing up room for other pieces of essential equipment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Considering the operations and procedures executed before an operator can intervene, the Double Block and Bleed manifold offers further advantages over the traditional hook up. Due to the volume of the cavity between the two balls being so small, the operator is afforded the opportunity to evacuate this space efficiently thereby quickly establishing a safe working environment.

In March 1910, [[William Boeing|William E.

Boeing, who studied at [[Yale University]], worked initially in the timber industry, where he became wealthy and learned about wooden structures. This knowledge proved invaluable in his subsequent design and assembly of [[airplane]]s. The company stayed in Seattle to take advantage of the local supply of [[spruce]] wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Howe |first=Sam |url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pacificnw/2012956268_pacificpjetage03.html |title=The tale of Boeing's high-risk flight into the jet age |work= [[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate= May 21, 2011 |date= October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the two [[Boeing Model 1|"B&amp;W" seaplanes]] built with the assistance of [[George Conrad Westervelt]], a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] engineer, took its [[maiden flight]] on June 15, 1916.  Boeing and Westervelt decided to build the B&amp;W seaplane after having flown in a [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtiss]] aircraft. Boeing bought a Glenn Martin [[Martin S|"Flying Birdcage"]] seaplane (so called because of all the [[guy-wire]]s holding it together) and was taught to fly by Glenn Martin himself. Boeing soon crashed the Birdcage and when Martin informed Boeing that replacement parts would not become available for months, Boeing realized he could build his own plane in that amount of time. He and his friend Cdr. G.C. Westervelt agreed to build a better airplane and soon produced the B&amp;W Seaplane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/history/narrative/n002boe.html Boeing History Narrative – Beginnings – Biplanes by the Sea] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120110756/http://boeing.com/history/narrative/n002boe.html |date= November 20, 2010}} Retrieved November 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  This first Boeing airplane was assembled in a lakeside hangar located on the northeast shore of Seattle's Lake Union. Many of Boeing's early planes were seaplanes.

[[File:Boeing B&amp;W.jpg|thumb|alt=Replica of Boeing Model 1, at the Museum of Flight|Replica of Boeing's first plane, the [[Boeing Model 1]], at the [[Museum of Flight]] ]]
On April 6, 1917, the U.S. declared war on Germany and entered [[World War I]]. On May 9, 1917, the company became the "Boeing Airplane Company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography of William E. Boeing |publisher=Boeing |url=http://www.boeing.com/resources/boeingdotcom/history-biography/pdf/william-e-boeing-biography.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the U.S. entering the war, Boeing knew that the U.S. Navy needed seaplanes for training. So Boeing shipped two new [[Boeing Model 2|Model Cs]] to Pensacola, Florida, where the planes were flown for the Navy. The Navy liked the Model C and ordered 50 more.&lt;ref name="WWI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/history/narrative/n004boe.html |title= Boeing History: Beginnings – World War I |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |publisher=Boeing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company moved its operations to a larger former shipbuilding facility known as [[Boeing Plant 1]], located on the lower Duwamish River, Washington state.

When World War I ended in 1918, a large surplus of cheap, used military planes flooded the commercial airplane market, preventing aircraft companies from selling any new airplanes, driving many out of business. Others, including Boeing, started selling other products. Boeing built dressers, counters, and furniture, along with flat-bottom boats called Sea Sleds.&lt;ref name="WWI" /&gt;

In 1919 the [[Boeing Model 6|Boeing B-1]] [[flying boat]] made its first flight. It accommodated one pilot and two passengers and some mail. Over the course of eight years, it made international [[airmail]] flights from Seattle to [[Victoria, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.boeing.com/history/boeing/b1.html |publisher= Boeing |work= History |title= Products – Boeing B-1 Seaplane |access-date= November 5, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 24, 1920, the [[Boeing Model 8]] made its first flight. It was the first plane to fly over [[Mount Rainier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boeing.com/history/narrative/n005boe.html |publisher =Boeing |work= History |title= Beginnings… Growing Pains |accessdate= November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Boeing entered competition against [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtiss]] to develop a pursuit [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] for the [[United States Army Air Service|U.S. Army Air Service]]. Although Curtiss finished its design first and was awarded the contract, Boeing continued to develop its [[Boeing Model 15|PW-9]] fighter. That plane, along with the [[Boeing P-12]]/F4B fighter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/history/boeing/p12.html Boeing P-12/F4B Fighter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120122828/http://boeing.com/history/boeing/p12.html |date= November 20, 2010}}, retrieved November 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; made Boeing a leading manufacturer of fighters over the course of the next decade.

In 1925, Boeing built its [[Boeing Model 40|Model 40]] mail plane for the U.S. government to use on airmail routes. In 1927, an improved version of this plane was built, the Model 40A which won the [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. Post Office]]'s contract to deliver mail between San Francisco and Chicago. The 40A also had a passenger cabin that accommodated two.&lt;ref name="airmail" /&gt;

That same year, Boeing created an airline named Boeing Air Transport, which merged a year later with [[Pacific Air Transport]] and the Boeing Airplane Company. The first airmail flight for the airline was on July 1, 1927.&lt;ref name= "airmail"&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/history/narrative/n006boe.html Boeing History—Beginnings... Mail and Boa abroad] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101120163356/http://boeing.com/history/narrative/n006boe.html |date=November 20, 2010}} Retrieved November 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The company changed its name to United Aircraft and Transport Corporation in 1929 and acquired [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]], [[Hamilton Standard |Hamilton Standard Propeller Company]], and [[Vought|Chance Vought]]. United Aircraft then purchased [[National Air Transport]] in 1930.

On July 27, 1928, the 12-passenger [[Boeing 80]] biplane made its first flight. With three engines, it was Boeing's first plane built with the sole intention of being a passenger transport. An upgraded version, the 80A, carrying eighteen passengers, made its first flight in September 1929.&lt;ref name="airmail" /&gt;

===1930s and 1940s===
In the early 1930s Boeing became a leader in all-metal aircraft construction, and in the design revolution that established the path for other transport aircraft through the 1930s.  In 1930, the [[Boeing Monomail|Monomail]], a low-wing [[monoplane]] that carried mail, was built. Built entirely out of metal, it was very fast and aerodynamic, and had retractable landing gear. In fact, its design was so revolutionary that the engines and propellers of the time could not handle the plane. By the time [[controllable pitch propeller]]s were developed, Boeing was building its Model 247 airliner. Two Monomails were built. The second one, the Model 221, had a 6-passenger cabin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boeing.com/history/narrative/n012boe.html |title=Boeing History-Early Years...Metal Monomail |publisher=Boeing |date=August 5, 2005 |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boeing.com/history/boeing/monomail.html |title=Boeing History-Products- Monomail |publisher=Boeing |date=May 6, 1930 |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1931, the Monomail design became the foundation of the [[Boeing YB-9]], the first all-metal, cantilever-wing, monoplane bomber.  Five examples entered service between September 1932 and March 1933.  The performance of the twin-engine monoplane bomber led to reconsideration of air defense requirements, although it was soon rendered obsolete by rapidly-advancing bomber designs.

In 1932, Boeing introduced the Model 248, the first all-metal monoplane fighter.  The [[P-26 Peashooter]] was in front-line service with the US Army Air Corps from 1934 to 1938.

In 1933, the [[Boeing 247]] was introduced, which set the standard for all competitors in the passenger transport market. The 247 was an all-metal low-wing monoplane that was much faster, safer, and easier to fly than other passenger aircraft. For example, it was the first twin engine passenger aircraft that could fly on one engine. In an era of unreliable engines, this vastly improved flight safety. Boeing built the first 59 aircraft exclusively for its own United Airlines subsidiary's operations. This badly hurt competing airlines, and was typical of the anti-competitive corporate behavior that the U.S. government sought to prohibit at the time.  The direction established with the 247 was further developed by [[Douglas Aircraft]], resulting in [[Douglas DC-3|one of the most successful designs]] in aviation history. 

The [[Air Mail Act]] of 1934 prohibited airlines and manufacturers from being under the same corporate umbrella, so the company split into three smaller companies – Boeing Airplane Company, [[United Airlines]], and [[United Aircraft|United Aircraft Corporation]], the precursor to [[United Technologies]]. As a result, William Boeing sold off his shares and left Boeing. [[Claire Egtvedt|Clairmont "Claire" L. Egtvedt]], who had become Boeing's president in 1933, became the chairman as well. He believed the company's future was in building bigger planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Boeing History |url= http://boeing.com/history/narrative/n014boe.html |publisher=Boeing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur.

From 1934 to 1937, Boeing was developing an experimental long range bomber, the [[XB-15]].  At its introduction in 1937 it was the largest heavier-than-air craft built to date.  Trials revealed that its speed was unsatisfactory, but the design experience was used in the development of the Model 314 that followed a year later.

Overlapping with the period of the YB-15 development, an agreement with [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) was reached, to develop and build a commercial [[flying boat]] able to carry passengers on transoceanic routes. The first flight of the [[Boeing 314 Clipper]] was in June 1938. It was the largest civil aircraft of its time, with a capacity of 90 passengers on day flights, and of 40 passengers on night flights. One year later, the first regular passenger service from the U.S. to the UK was inaugurated. Subsequently, other routes were opened, so that soon Pan Am flew with the Boeing 314 to destinations all over the world.

In 1938, Boeing completed work on its [[Boeing 307|Model 307 ''Stratoliner'']]. This was the world's first pressurized-cabin transport aircraft, and it was capable of cruising at an altitude of {{convert|20000|ft|m}} – above most weather disturbances. It was based on the B-17, using the same wings, tail and engines.

During World War II, Boeing built a large number of [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] and [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] [[bomber]]s. Boeing ranked twelfth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] &amp; [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the workers were women whose husbands had gone to war. In the beginning of March 1944, production had been scaled up in such a manner that over 350 planes were built each month. To prevent an attack from the air, the manufacturing plants had been covered with greenery and farmland items. During the war years the leading aircraft companies of the U.S. cooperated. The Boeing-designed B-17 bomber was assembled also by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft Corp.]] and [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas Aircraft Co.]], while the B-29 was assembled also by [[Bell Aircraft Corporation|Bell Aircraft Co.]] and by [[Glenn L. Martin Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur. ''Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II,'' pp. 118, 297–8, Random House, New York, NY. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-6964-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1942 Boeing started development of the [[C-97 Stratofreighter]], the first of a generation of heavy-lift military transports; it became operational in 1947.  The C-97 design would be successfully adapted for use as an aerial refueling tanker, although its role as a transport was soon limited by designs that had advantages in either versatility or capacity.

After the war, most orders of bombers were canceled and 70,000 people lost their jobs at Boeing.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The company aimed to recover quickly by selling its [[Stratocruiser]] (the Model 377), a luxurious four-engine commercial [[airliner]] derived from the [[C-97 Stratofreighter|C-97]]. However, sales of this model were not as expected and Boeing had to seek other opportunities to overcome the situation.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  In 1947 Boeing flew its first jet aircraft, the XB-47, from which the highly successful [[B-47]] and [[B-52]] bombers were derived.

===1950s===
[[File:Boac 707 at london airport in 1964 arp.jpg|thumb|alt=Boeing 707 painted with BOAC on it|The [[Boeing 707]] in [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) livery, 1964]]

Boeing developed military jets such as the [[B-47 Stratojet]]&lt;ref name=Natola&gt;{{Cite book |editor=Mark Natola |title=Boeing B-47 Stratojet |publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd. |year=2002 |isbn=0764316702 |pages=17–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers in the late-1940s and into the 1950s. During the early 1950s, Boeing used company funds to develop the [[Boeing 367-80|367–80]] jet airliner demonstrator that led to the [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] and [[Boeing 707]] jetliner. Some of these were built at Boeing's facilities in [[Wichita, Kansas]], which existed from 1931 to 2014.

Between the last delivery of a 377 in 1950 and the first order for the 707 in 1955, Boeing was shut out of the commercial aircraft market.

In the mid-1950s technology had advanced significantly, which gave Boeing the opportunity to develop and manufacture new products. One of the first was the guided short-range [[missile]] used to intercept enemy aircraft. By that time the [[Cold War]] had become a fact of life, and Boeing used its short-range missile technology to develop and build an intercontinental missile.

In 1958, Boeing began delivery of its 707, the United States' first commercial [[jet airliner]], in response to the British [[De Havilland Comet]], French [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Tupolev Tu-104]], which were the world's first generation of commercial jet aircraft. With the 707, a four-engine, 156-passenger airliner, the U.S. became a leader in commercial jet manufacturing. A few years later, Boeing added a second version of this aircraft, the [[Boeing 720]], which was slightly faster and had a shorter range.

Boeing was a major producer of small turbine engines during the 1950s and 1960s. The engines represented one of the company's major efforts to expand its product base beyond military aircraft after World War II. Development on the gas turbine engine started in 1943 and Boeing's gas turbines were designated models [[Boeing T50|502 (T50)]], [[Boeing T60|520 (T60)]], 540, 551 and 553. Boeing built 2,461 engines before production ceased in April 1968. Many applications of the Boeing gas turbine engines were considered to be firsts, including the first turbine-powered helicopter and boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.boeing.com/history/products/model-502-gas-turbine-engine.page |title= History &gt; Products &gt; Model 502 gas turbine engine |publisher= Boeing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piasecki Helicopter|Vertol Aircraft Corporation]] was acquired by Boeing in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/history/narrative/n053boe.html |title=Boeing History 1957–1970 |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reorganized as Boeing's [[Boeing Vertol|Vertol division]]. The twin-rotor [[CH-47 Chinook]], produced by Vertol, took its first flight in 1961. This heavy-lift [[helicopter]] remains a work-horse vehicle to the present day. In 1964, Vertol also began production of the [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46 Sea Knight]].

In December 1960, Boeing announced the model [[Boeing 727|727]] jetliner, which went into commercial service about three years later. Different passenger, freight and convertible freighter variants were developed for the 727. The 727 was the first commercial jetliner to reach 1,000 sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boeing: Historical Snapshot|url=http://www.boeing.com/history/products/727.page|website=Boeing|publisher=Boeing|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeing won a contract in 1961 to manufacture the [[S-IC]] stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket, manufactured at the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] in New Orleans, Louisiana.

In 1966, Boeing president [[William M. Allen]] asked [[Malcolm T. Stamper]] to spearhead production of the new [[Boeing 747|747]] airliner on which the company's future was riding. This was a monumental engineering and management challenge, and included construction of the world's biggest factory in which to build the 747 at [[Everett, Washington]], a plant which is the size of 40 football fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/obituaries/2002339060_stamperobit17.html |work=The Seattle Times |first=Tom |last=Boyer |title=Boeing legend Malcolm Stamper dies |date=June 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Boeing introduced another short- and medium-range airliner, the twin-engine [[Boeing 737|737]]. It has since become the best-selling commercial jet aircraft in aviation history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wyse|first1=Beverley|title=Vice President and General Manager, Next-Generation 737 Program|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/2012_q4/1/|accessdate=September 28, 2016|publisher=Boeing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several versions have been developed, mainly to increase [[seating capacity]] and range.  The 737 remains in production as of February 2018 with the latest 737 MAX series.

The roll-out ceremonies for the first [[Boeing 747|747-100]] took place in 1968, at the massive new factory in Everett, about an hour's drive from Boeing's Seattle home. The aircraft made its first flight a year later. The first commercial flight occurred in 1970. The 747 has an intercontinental range and a larger [[seating capacity]] than Boeing's previous aircraft.

Boeing also developed [[Boeing hydrofoils|hydrofoils]] in the 1960s. The screw-driven [[USS High Point (PCH-1)|USS ''High Point'' (PCH-1)]] was an experimental submarine hunter. The patrol hydrofoil [[USS Tucumcari (PGH-2)|USS ''Tucumcari'' (PGH-2)]] was more successful. Only one was built, but it saw service in Vietnam and Europe before running aground in 1972. Its waterjet and fully submersed flying foils were the example for the later Pegasus-class patrol hydrofoils and the [[Boeing 929|Model 929 Jetfoil]] ferries in the 1980s. The Tucumcari and later boats were produced in Renton. While the Navy hydrofoils were withdrawn from service in the late 1980s, the Boeing Jetfoils are still in service in Asia.

===1970s===
In the early 1970s Boeing suffered from the simultaneous decline in [[Vietnam War]] military spending, the slowing of the space program as [[Project Apollo]] neared completion, the [[recession of 1969–70]],{{r|heppenheimer1998}}{{rp|291}} and the company's $2&amp;nbsp;billion debt as it built the new [[Boeing 747|747]] airliner.{{r|heppenheimer1998}}{{rp|303}} Boeing did not receive any orders for more than a year. Its bet for the future, the 747, was delayed in production by three months because of problems with its Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. Then in March 1971, [[92nd United States Congress|Congress]] voted to discontinue funding for the development of the [[Boeing 2707]] [[supersonic transport]] (SST), the US's answer to the British-French [[Concorde]], forcing the end of the project.&lt;ref name=bbsrej&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6OlPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xwgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5992%2C2360277 |work=The Bulletin |location=(Bend, Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=Senators reject more funds for transport plane |date=March 24, 1971 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ergfden&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LDNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u-cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6299%2C4861409 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=SST funds denied |date=March 24, 1971 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=srbwlof&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SvkRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j-0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6507%2C2890808 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington)|agency=Associated Press |title=Boeing will lay off 7,000 workers with disbandment of SST program |date=March 26, 1971 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stsuplch&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LTNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u-cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6561%2C5246912 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=SST supporters see little chance of reviving plan |date=March 25, 1971 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bwhhit&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6elPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xwgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4342%2C2463253|work=The Bulletin |location=(Bend, Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=Boeing workers hardest hit by vote |date=March 25, 1971 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/history/products/supersonic-transport.page |title=Supersonic Transport |publisher=Boeing |access-date= July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boeing Commercial Airplanes|Commercial Airplane Group]], by far the largest unit of Boeing, went from 83,700 employees in 1968 to 20,750 in 1971. Each unemployed Boeing employee cost at least one other job in the Seattle area, and unemployment rose to 14&amp;nbsp;percent, the highest in the United States.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Housing vacancy rates rose to 16&amp;nbsp;percent from 1&amp;nbsp;percent in 1967.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[U-Haul]] dealerships ran out of trailers because so many people moved out.

In January 1970, the first 747, a four-engine long-range airliner, flew its first commercial flight with [[Pan American World Airways]].  The 747 changed the airline industry, providing much larger [[seating capacity]] than any other airliner in production.  The company has delivered over 1,500 Boeing 747s. The 747 has undergone continuous improvements to keep it technologically up-to-date. Larger versions have also been developed by stretching the upper deck. The newest version of the 747, the [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]], remains in production as of 2018.

Boeing launched three Jetfoil 929-100 hydrofoils that were acquired in 1975 for service in the Hawaiian Islands. When the service ended in 1979 the three hydrofoils were acquired by Far East Hydrofoil for service between Hong Kong and Macau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfastferries.com/cff/pdf/cff_2004_2.pdf?bcsi_scan_A4C9E8056B19D97F=0&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=cff_2004_2.pdf |title=Classic Fast Ferries |format=PDF |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, Boeing also developed the [[US Standard Light Rail Vehicle]], which has been used in San Francisco, Boston, and Morgantown, [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Please Help Us Preserve Boeing-Vertol Standard Light Rail Vehicle No. 3424 from Boston|url=https://www.trolleymuseum.org/documents/fundraiser-SLRV3424.pdf|website=Seashore Trolley Museum|publisher=Seashore Trolley Museum|accessdate=September 23, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629173508/https://www.trolleymuseum.org/documents/fundraiser-SLRV3424.pdf|archivedate=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the economic situation began to improve. Boeing assembled its 1,000th 737 passenger aircraft. During the following years, commercial aircraft and their military versions became the basic equipment of airlines and air forces. As passenger air traffic increased, competition was harder, mainly from [[Airbus]], a European newcomer in commercial airliner manufacturing. Boeing had to offer new aircraft, and developed the single-aisle [[Boeing 757|757]], the larger, twin-aisle [[Boeing 767|767]], and upgraded versions of the 737. An important project of these years was the [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]], to which Boeing contributed with its experience in space rockets acquired during the Apollo era. Boeing participated also with other products in the space program, and was the first contractor for the [[International Space Station]] program.

During the decade several military projects went into production, including Boeing support of the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 stealth bomber]]. As part of an industry team led by Northrop, Boeing built the B-2's outer wing portion, aft center fuselage section, landing gear, fuel system, and weapons delivery system. At its peak in 1991, the B-2 was the largest military program at Boeing, employing about 10,000 people. The same year, the US's [[National Aeronautic Association]] awarded the B-2 design team the Collier Trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in America. The first B-2 rolled out of the bomber's final assembly facility in [[Palmdale, California]], in November 1988 and it flew for the first time on July 17, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/history/boeing/b2.html |title=History – Products – B-2 Spirit |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Avenger air defense system and a new generation of short-range missiles also went into production. During these years, Boeing was very active in upgrading existing military equipment and developing new ones. Boeing also contributed to [[wind power]] development with the experimental [[MOD-2 Wind Turbine]]s for [[NASA]] and the [[United States Department of Energy]], and the [[MOD-5B Wind Turbine|MOD-5B]] for Hawaii.&lt;ref name=boeingwindpower&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/history/boeing/windturbine.html |title=MOD-2/MOD-5B Wind Turbines |accessdate=June 30, 2009 |quote= |publisher=Boeing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeing was one of seven competing companies that bid for the [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]]. Boeing agreed to team with General Dynamics and Lockheed, so that all three companies would participate in the development if one of the three companies designs was selected. The Lockheed design was eventually selected and developed into the [[F-22 Raptor]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jay. ''Lockheed Martin F/A-22 Raptor, Stealth Fighter''. Aerofax, 2005. {{ISBN|1-85780-158-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1994, Boeing introduced the most modern commercial jet aircraft at the time, the twin-engine [[Boeing 777|777]], with a [[seating capacity]] of approximately 300 to 370 passengers in a typical three-class layout, in between the 767 and the 747. The longest range twin-engined aircraft in the world, the 777 was the first Boeing airliner to feature a "[[Aircraft flight control system|fly-by-wire]]" system and was conceived partly in response to the inroads being made by the European Airbus into Boeing's traditional market. This aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Guy and Mark Wagner. ''Boeing 777: The Technological Marvel''. Minneapolis, Minnesota: Zenith Imprint, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7603-0890-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 777 was also the first airplane to be certified for 180 minute [[ETOPS]] at entry into service by the [[FAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pandey|first=Mohan|title=How Boeing Defied the Airbus Challenge|year=2010|publisher=Createspace|isbn=978-1-4505-0113-2|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IWXSQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in the mid-1990s, the company developed the revamped version of the 737, known as the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737 "Next-Generation"]], or 737NG. It has since become the fastest-selling version of the 737 in history, and on April 20, 2006 sales passed those of the [[Boeing 737 Classic|"Classic 737"]], with a follow-up order for 79 aircraft from [[Southwest Airlines]].

In 1995, Boeing chose to demolish the headquarters complex on East Marginal Way South instead of upgrading it to match new seismic standards. The headquarters were moved to an adjacent building and the facility was demolished in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BOEING+TO+RAZE+COMPANY+HEADQUARTERS+BUILDING%3B+WILL+RELOCATE+TO...-a017125011 Boeing to Raze Company Headquarters Building; Will Relocate to Adjacent Building]" August 4, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997, Boeing was headquartered on East Marginal Way South, by [[King County Airport]], in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naesb.org/pdf/ec0520ma.pdf |title=Revises meeting arrangements and map for the Executive committee Meeting |publisher= Gas Industry Standards Board |date=April 30, 1999 |accessdate=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Boeing acquired [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]]'s aerospace and defense units. The Rockwell business units became a subsidiary of Boeing, named Boeing North American, Inc. In August 1997, Boeing merged with [[McDonnell Douglas]] in a US$13&amp;nbsp;billion stock swap, with Boeing as the surviving company.&lt;ref name=Logbook/&gt;{{Nonspecific|date=July 2018}} Following the merger, the McDonnell Douglas MD-95 was renamed the [[Boeing 717]], and the production of the MD-11 trijet was limited to the freighter version. Boeing introduced a new corporate identity with completion of the merger, incorporating the Boeing logo type and a stylized version of the McDonnell Douglas symbol, which was derived from the [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas Aircraft]] logo from the 1970s.

An aerospace analyst criticized the CEO and his deputy, [[Philip M. Condit]] and [[Harry Stonecipher]], for thinking of their personal benefit first, and causing the problems to Boeing many years later. Instead of investing the huge cash reserve to build new airplanes, they initiated a program to buy back Boeing stock for more than US$10&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2011/38/Boeing-Dreamliner {{sic|MISSMANAGEMENT}}: Himmel, hilf!], DIE ZEIT, September 20, 2011 (de).

In May 1999, Boeing studied buying Embraer to encourage commonality between the [[E-Jet]]s and the [[Boeing 717]], but this was nixed by then president Harry Stonecipher.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes11jan2018&gt;--&gt; He preferred buying [[Bombardier Aerospace]], but its owner, the [[Laurent Beaudoin|Beaudoin]] family, asked for a price too high for Boeing which remembered its mid-1980s purchase of [[de Havilland Canada]], losing a million dollars every day for three years before selling it to Bombardier in 1992.&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes11jan2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeings-bid-to-buy-embraer-could-see-brazilian-engineers-work-on-the-797/ |title= Boeing’s bid to buy Embraer could see Brazilian engineers work on the 797 |date= January 11, 2018 |author= Dominic Gates |newspaper= The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000, Boeing chose to expand its presence in another aerospace field of satellite communications by purchasing Hughes Electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/13/business/3.75-billion-boeing-hughes-satellite-deal-expected.html|title=$3.75 Billion Boeing-Hughes Satellite Deal Expected|date=January 13, 2000|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hughes Space and Communications Company]], which had pioneered the satellite communications field.

In September 2001, Boeing moved its corporate headquarters from Seattle to Chicago.

On October 10, 2001, Boeing lost to its rival [[Lockheed Martin]] in the fierce competition for the multibillion-dollar [[Joint Strike Fighter Program|Joint Strike Fighter]] contract. Boeing's entry, the [[Boeing X-32|X-32]], was rejected in favor of Lockheed's [[Lockheed Martin X-35|X-35]] entrant. Boeing continues to serve as the prime contractor on the International Space Station and has built several of the major components.

Boeing began development of the [[Boeing KC-767|KC-767]] aerial refueling tanker in the early 2000s. Italy and Japan ordered four KC-767s each.

In 2004, Boeing ended production of the 757 after 1,050 aircraft were produced. More advanced, stretched versions of the 737 were beginning to compete against the 757, and the planned 787-3 was to fill much of the top end of the 757 market. Also that year, Boeing announced that the 717, the last civil aircraft to be designed by McDonnell Douglas, would cease production in 2006. The 767 was in danger of cancellation as well, with the 787 replacing it, but orders for the freighter version extended the program.

After several decades of success, Boeing [[Competition between Airbus and Boeing|lost ground to Airbus]] and subsequently lost its lead in the airliner market in 2003. Multiple Boeing projects were pursued and then canceled, notably the [[Boeing Sonic Cruiser|Sonic Cruiser]], a proposed jetliner that would travel just under the [[speed of sound]], cutting intercontinental travel times by as much as 20 percent. It was launched in 2001 along with a new advertising campaign to promote the company's new motto, "Forever New Frontiers", and to rehabilitate its image. However, the plane's fate was sealed by the changes in the commercial aviation market following the [[September 11 attacks]] and the subsequent weak economy and increase in fuel prices.

Subsequently, Boeing streamlined its production and turned its attention to a new model, the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]], using much of the technology developed for the Sonic Cruiser, but in a more conventional aircraft designed for maximum efficiency. The company also launched new variants of its successful 737 and 777 models. The 787 proved to be a highly popular choice with airlines, and won a record number of pre-launch orders. With delays to Airbus' [[Airbus A380|A380]] program several airlines threatened to switch their A380 orders to Boeing's new 747 version, the [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]].&lt;ref name="times_delays_20061004"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article659591.ece|title=Airbus will lose €4.8bn because of A380 delays|first=David|last=Robertson|work=The Times|date=October 4, 2006 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airbus's response to the 787, the [[Airbus A350|A350]], received a lukewarm response at first when it was announced as an improved version of the A330, and then gained significant orders when Airbus promised an entirely new design. The 787 program encountered delays, with the first flight not occurring until late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8224799.stm "Boeing 787 first flight announced"]. BBC News Online, August 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After regulatory approval, Boeing formed a joint venture, [[United Launch Alliance]] with its competitor, Lockheed Martin, on December 1, 2006. The new venture is the largest provider of rocket launch services to the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2006-12-01-Boeing-and-Lockheed-Martin-Complete-United-Launch-Alliance-Transaction |title=Boeing and Lockheed Martin Complete United Launch Alliance Transaction (news release) |publisher=The Boeing Company |date=December 1, 2006 |accessdate=January 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Gary Scott, ex-Boeing executive and then head of Bombardier's [[Bombardier CSeries|CSeries]] program, suggested a collaboration on the upcoming CSeries, but an internal study assessed Embraer as the best partner for [[regional jet]]s.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes11jan2018&gt;--&gt; The Brazilian government wanted to retain control and blocked an acquisition.&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes11jan2018/&gt;

On August 2, 2005, Boeing sold its [[Rocketdyne]] rocket engine division to [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]]. On May 1, 2006, Boeing agreed to purchase Dallas, Texas-based [[Aviall, Inc.]] for $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion and retain $350&amp;nbsp;million in debt. Aviall, Inc. and its subsidiaries, Aviall Services, Inc. and ILS formed a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing Commercial Aviation Services (BCAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationpros.com/press_release/10394574/boeing-concludes-purchase-of-aviall-inc |title=Concludes Purchase of Aviall, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing that increasing numbers of passengers have become reliant on their computers to stay in touch, Boeing introduced [[Connexion by Boeing]], a satellite based Internet connectivity service that promised air travelers unprecedented access to the World Wide Web. The company debuted the product to journalists in 2005, receiving generally favorable reviews. However, facing competition from cheaper options, such as cellular networks, it proved too difficult to sell to most airlines. In August 2006, after a short and unsuccessful search for a buyer for the business, Boeing chose to discontinue the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5261562.stm |title=Boeing exits in-flight broadband |publisher=BBC News Online |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=January 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2006-08-17-Boeing-to-Discontinue-Connexion-by-Boeing-Service |title=Boeing to Discontinue Connexion by Boeing Service (news release) |publisher=The Boeing Company |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=January 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2007, NASA selected Boeing as the manufacturing contractor for the liquid-fueled upper stage of the [[Ares I]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Daniel|title=NASA Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle Upper Stage Overview|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090004512.pdf|website=National Aeronautic and Space Administration|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage, based on both [[Project Apollo|Apollo]]-[[Saturn V|Saturn]] and [[Space Shuttle]] technologies, was to be constructed at NASA's [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] near New Orleans; Boeing constructed the [[S-IC]] stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket at this site in the 1960s.

[[File:Boeing 787first flight.jpg|thumb|left|The Boeing 787 Dreamliner on its first flight]]
Boeing launched the [[Boeing 777|777 Freighter]] in May 2005 with an order from [[Air France]]. The freighter variant is based on the −200LR. Other customers include [[FedEx Express|FedEx]] and [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]]. Boeing officially announced in November 2005 that it would produce a larger variant of the 747, the 747-8, in two versions, commencing with the Freighter version with firm orders for two cargo carriers. The second version, named the Intercontinental, is for passenger airlines. Both 747-8 versions feature a lengthened fuselage, new, advanced engines and wings, and the incorporation of other technologies developed for the 787.

Boeing also received the launch contract from the [[U.S. Navy]] for the [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8 Poseidon]] Multimission Maritime Aircraft, an [[anti-submarine warfare]] patrol aircraft. It has also received orders for the [[Boeing 737 AEW&amp;C|737 AEW&amp;C]] "Wedgetail" aircraft. The company has also introduced new extended range versions of the 737. These include the 737-700ER and 737-900ER. The 737-900ER is the latest and will extend the range of the 737–900 to a similar range as the successful 737–800 with the capability to fly more passengers, due to the addition of two extra emergency exits.

[[File:B777-200LR Paris Air Show 2005 display.jpg|thumb|alt=777-200LR Worldliner at the Paris Air Show 2005|The record-breaking 777-200LR Worldliner, presented at the [[Paris Air Show]] 2005.]]
The 777-200LR Worldliner embarked on a well-received global demonstration tour in the second half of 2005, showing off its capacity to fly farther than any other commercial aircraft. On November 10, 2005, the 777-200LR set a world record for the longest non-stop flight. The plane, which departed from Hong Kong traveling to London, took a longer route, which included flying over the U.S. It flew 11,664 nautical miles (21,601&amp;nbsp;km) during its 22-hour 42-minute flight. It was flown by [[Pakistan International Airlines]] pilots and PIA was the first airline to fly the 777-200LR Worldliner.

On August 11, 2006, Boeing agreed to form a joint-venture with the large Russian [[titanium]] producer, [[VSMPO-Avisma]] for the machining of titanium forgings. The forgings will be used on the 787 program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2006-08-11-Boeing-and-VSMPO-AVISMA-Announce-Titanium-Agreement "Boeing and VSMPO-AVISMA Announce Titanium Agreement"], Boeing, August 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2007, Boeing and VSMPO-Avisma created a joint venture, Ural Boeing Manufacturing, and signed a contract on titanium product deliveries until 2015, with Boeing planning to invest $27&amp;nbsp;billion in Russia over the next 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721000147/http://www.vsmpo.ru/cat_details.php?script=news.php&amp;p=&amp;zps=649&amp;lang=2 Корпорация ВСМПО-АВИСМА]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Boeing received a contract for 179 [[Boeing KC-46|KC-46]] U.S. Air Force tankers at a value of $35&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=179tank&gt;{{cite news |author=Donna Cassata, Lolita C.

====Unethical conduct====
In May 2003, the [[U.S. Air Force]] announced it would lease 100 [[Boeing KC-767|KC-767]] tankers to replace the oldest 136 [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135s]]. In November 2003, responding to critics who argued that the lease was more expensive than an outright purchase, the DoD announced a revised lease of 20 aircraft and purchase of 80. In December 2003, the Pentagon announced the project was to be frozen while an investigation of allegations of corruption by one of its former procurement staffers, [[Darleen Druyun]] (who began employment at Boeing in January) was begun. The fallout of this resulted in the resignation of Boeing CEO Philip M. Condit and the termination of CFO [[Michael M. Sears]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51778-2004Nov15.html "Ex-Boeing CFO Pleads Guilty in Druyun Case"], ''The Washington Post'', November 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Stonecipher]], former McDonnell Douglas CEO and Boeing COO, replaced Condit on an interim basis. Druyun pleaded guilty to inflating the price of the contract to favor her future employer and to passing information on the competing [[Airbus A330 MRTT]] bid. In October 2004, she received a jail sentence for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64968-2004Oct1.html Ex-Air Force Official Gets Prison Time]. ''The Washington Post''. Retrieved on August 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, the Boeing board forced President and CEO Harry Stonecipher to resign. Boeing said an internal investigation revealed a "consensual" relationship between Stonecipher and a female executive that was "inconsistent with Boeing's Code of Conduct" and "would impair his ability to lead the company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comspacewatch.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=16323 |title=Boeing CEO Stonecipher Resigns press release |publisher=Comspacewatch.com |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James A. Bell]] served as interim CEO (in addition to his normal duties as Boeing's CFO) until the appointment of [[Jim McNerney]] as the new Chairman, President, and CEO on June 30, 2005.

====Industrial espionage====
In June 2003, Lockheed Martin sued Boeing, alleging that the company had resorted to [[industrial espionage]] in 1998 to win the [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]] (EELV) competition. Lockheed Martin claimed that the former employee Kenneth Branch, who went to work for [[McDonnell Douglas]] and Boeing, passed nearly 30,000 pages of proprietary documents to his new employers. Lockheed Martin argued that these documents allowed Boeing to win 19 of the 28 tendered military satellite launches.&lt;ref name=Anatomy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/050123/anatomy.shtml |title=Anatomy of a corporate espionage scandal |work=The Decatur Daily |date=January 23, 2005 |author=Fleischauer, Eric |location=Decatur, Alabama |accessdate=March 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boeing_probe/&gt;

In July 2003, Boeing was penalized, with the Pentagon stripping seven launches away from the company and awarding them to Lockheed Martin.&lt;ref name=Anatomy/&gt; Furthermore, the company was forbidden to bid for rocket contracts for a twenty-month period, which expired in March 2005.&lt;ref name=Boeing_probe&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2002146025_boeinglockheed09.html |title=Boeing probe intensifies over secret Lockheed papers |work=The Seattle Times |date=January 9, 2005 |author=Bowermaster, David |location=Seattle |accessdate=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early September 2005, it was reported that Boeing was negotiating a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in which it would pay up to $500&amp;nbsp;million to cover this and the Darleen Druyun scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=St. Louis Business Journal |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2005/09/05/daily53.html |title=Boeing, DOJ may reach settlement |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=September 9, 2005 |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 EU-US Agreement notes===
Until the late 1970s, the U.S. had a near monopoly in the Large Civil Aircraft (LCA) sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newquist|first=Don E.|title=Global Competitiveness of U.S. Advanced-Technology Manufacturing Industries: Large Civil Aircraft|url=http://usitc.gov/publications/332/PUB2667.PDF|publisher=U.S. International Trade Commission|accessdate=January 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Airbus consortium (created in 1969) started competing effectively in the 1980s. At that stage the U.S. became concerned about the European competition and the alleged subsidies paid by the European governments for the developments of the early models of the Airbus family. This became a major issue of contention, as the European side was equally concerned by subsidies accruing to U.S. LCA manufacturers through NASA and Defense programs.

The EU and the U.S. started bilateral negotiations for the limitation of government subsidies to the LCA sector in the late 1980s. Negotiations were concluded in 1992 with the signing of the EC-US Agreement on Trade in Large Civil Aircraft which imposes disciplines on government support on both sides of the Atlantic which are significantly stricter than the relevant [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) rules: Notably, the Agreement regulates in detail the forms and limits of government support, prescribes transparency obligations and commits the parties to avoiding trade disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2004/october/tradoc_119237.pdf |title=Top margin 1 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subsidy disputes====
In 2004, the EU and the U.S. agreed to discuss a possible revision of the 1992 EU-US Agreement provided that this would cover all forms of subsidies including those used in the U.S., and in particular the subsidies for the Boeing 787; the first new aircraft to be launched by Boeing for 14&amp;nbsp;years. In October 2004 the U.S. began legal proceedings at the WTO by requesting WTO consultations on European launch investment to Airbus. The U.S. also unilaterally withdrew from the 1992 EU-US Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trade-info.cec.eu.int/doclib/docs/2005/july/tradoc_124112.pdf |title=EU resumes WTO case against Boeing |publisher=European Trade Commission, Commissioner Mandelson |format=PDF |date=May 31, 2005 |accessdate=October 26, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216010307/http://trade-info.cec.eu.int/doclib/docs/2005/july/tradoc_124112.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. claimed Airbus had violated a 1992 bilateral accord when it received what Boeing deemed "unfair" subsidies from several European governments. Airbus responded by filing a separate complaint, contesting that Boeing had also violated the accord when it received tax breaks from the U.S. Government. Moreover, the EU also complained that the investment subsidies from Japanese airlines violated the accord.

On January 11, 2005, Boeing and Airbus agreed that they would attempt to find a solution to the dispute outside of the WTO. However, in June 2005, Boeing and the United States government reopened the trade dispute with the WTO, claiming that Airbus had received illegal subsidies from European governments. Airbus has also responded to this claim against Boeing, reopening the dispute and also accusing Boeing of receiving subsidies from the U.S. Government.&lt;ref name="subsidies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://igeographer.lib.indstate.edu/pritchard.pdf|title=Industrial Subsidies and the Politics of World Trade: The Case of the Boeing 7e7|publisher=Canada-United States Trade Center|format=PDF |page=17 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2010, the WTO ruled that Boeing had received billions of dollars in government subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagobreakingbusiness.com/2010/09/wto-report-cites-illinois-tax-breaks-to-boeing.html |title=Illinois tax breaks in WTO ruling against Boeing |publisher=Chicagobreakingbusiness.com |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing responded by stating that the ruling was a fraction of the size of the ruling against Airbus and that it required few changes in its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1423 |title=Boeing Response to Public Reports Regarding the WTO's Interim Decision in DS 353 |publisher=Boeing |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing has received $8.7 billion in support from Washington state.&lt;ref name=taxrebate2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150602-story.html |title=Elon Musk: 'If I cared about subsidies, I would have entered the oil and gas industry' |author= Jerry Hirsch |date=June 2, 2015 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=October 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--direct source preferred--&gt;

===Future concepts===
In May 2006, four concept designs being examined by Boeing were outlined in ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' based on corporate internal documents. The research aims in two directions: low-cost airplanes, and environmental-friendly planes. Codenamed after the well-known [[Muppets]], a design team known as the Green Team concentrated primarily on reducing fuel usage. All four designs illustrated rear-engine layouts.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;
* "Fozzie" employs open rotors and offers a lower cruising speed.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;
* "Beaker" has very thin, long wings, with the ability to partially fold-up to facilitate easier taxiing.
* "Kermit Kruiser" has forward swept wings over which are positioned its engines, with the aim of lowering noise below due to the reflection of the exhaust signature upward.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;
* "Honeydew" with its delta wing design, resembles a marriage of the [[flying wing]] concept and the traditional tube fuselage.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

As with most concepts, these designs are only in the exploratory stage, intended to help Boeing evaluate the potentials of such radical technologies.&lt;ref name=ST&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002973147_boeingconcepts05.html |title=Clean engines, wings that fold: Boeing dreams of futuristic jets |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |author=Dominic Gates |date=May 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeing recently patented its own force field technology, also known as the shock wave attenuation system, that would protect vehicles from shock waves generated by nearby explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernandez|first1=Vittorio|title=Boeing Gets Patent For Force Field Technology That Protects Vehicles From Nearby Blasts|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/boeing-gets-patent-force-field-technology-protects-vehicles-nearby-blasts-1435658|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150404181955/http://au.ibtimes.com/boeing-gets-patent-force-field-technology-protects-vehicles-nearby-blasts-1435658|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 4, 2015|accessdate=March 31, 2015|work=International Business Times|date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing has yet to confirm when they plan to build and test the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Naik Desai|first1=Alap|title=Boeing’s Plasma ‘Force Field’ Aims To Shield Vehicles Against Shock Waves From Blasts – Won’t Stop Bullets Though|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1967795/boeings-plasma-force-field/|accessdate=March 31, 2015|work=The Inquistr|date=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Boeing Yellowstone Project]] is the company's project to replace its entire civil aircraft portfolio with advanced technology aircraft. New technologies to be introduced include composite aerostructures, more electrical systems (reduction of hydraulic systems), and more fuel-efficient turbofan engines, such as the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1000G Geared Turbofan, General Electric GEnx, the CFM International LEAP56, and the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000. The term "Yellowstone" refers to the technologies, while "Y1" through "Y3" refer to the actual aircraft.

===2010–2016===
&lt;!--2010--&gt;
In summer 2010, Boeing acquired [[Fairfax, VA]]-based [[Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance|C4ISR]] and combat systems developer [[Argon ST]] to expand its C4ISR, cyber and intelligence capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2010-08-05-Boeing-Successfully-Completes-Acquisition-of-Argon-ST |title=Boeing: Boeing Successfully Completes Acquisition of Argon ST |publisher=Boeing |date= August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--2011--&gt;
In 2011, Boeing was hesitating between [[re-engine]]ing the 737 or developing an all-new small airplane for which [[Embraer]] could have been involved, but when the [[A320neo]] was launched with new engines, that precipitated the [[737 MAX]] decision.&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes11jan2018/&gt;

=== Since 2017 ===
In October 2017, Boeing announced plans to acquire [[Aurora Flight Sciences]] to expand its capabilities to develop autonomous, electric-powered and long-flight-duration aircraft for its commercial and military businesses, pending regulatory approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aurora-m-a-boeing/boeing-to-buy-aircraft-technologies-provider-aurora-flight-sciences-idUSKBN1CA1KU |title= Boeing to buy autonomous and electric flight firm Aurora |date= October 5, 2017 |agency= Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/boeing-agrees-to-acquire-autonomy-pioneer-aurora-fli-441868/ |title= Boeing agrees to acquire autonomy pioneer Aurora Flight Sciences |date= October 5, 2017 |first= Stephen |last= Trimble |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Boeing won 912 net orders for $134.8 billion at list prices including 745 737s, 94 787s and 60 777s, and delivered 763 airliners including 529 737s, 136 787s and 74 777s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2018-01-09-Boeing-Sets-Airplane-Delivery-Record-Finishes-2017-with-Larger-Order-Book |title= Boeing Sets Airplane Delivery Record, Finishes 2017 with Larger Order Book |date= January 9, 2018 |publisher= Boeing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, a joint venture was formed by auto seat maker [[Adient]] (50.01%) and Boeing (49.99%) to develop and manufacture [[airliner seat]]s for new installations or retrofit, a $4.5 billion market in 2017 which will grow to $6 billion by 2026, to be based in [[Kaiserslautern]] near Frankfurt and distributed by Boeing subsidiary Aviall, with its customer service center in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title= Boeing, Adient Launch New Company to Design and Build Airplane Seats |date= January 16, 2018 |url= http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2018-01-16-Boeing-Adient-Launch-New-Company-to-Design-and-Build-Airplane-Seats |publisher= Boeing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2018, Boeing and [[Safran]] announced a 50-50 partnership to design, build and service [[Auxiliary Power Unit|APU]]s after regulatory and [[antitrust]] clearance in the second half of 2018.&lt;ref name= 4jun2018PR&gt;{{cite press release |title= Boeing, Safran Agree to Design, Build and Service Auxiliary Power Units |date= June 4, 2018 |url= http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2018-06-04-Boeing-Safran-Agree-to-Design-Build-and-Service-Auxiliary-Power-Units |publisher= Boeing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This could threaten the dominance of [[Honeywell]] and [[United Technologies]] in the APU market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/boeing-and-safran-partner-to-disrupt-apu-market-449184/ |title= Boeing and Safran partner to disrupt APU market |date= June 4, 2018 |first= Stephen |last= Trimble |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==

===Environmental record===
In 2006, the [[UCLA]] Center for Environmental Risk Reduction released a study showing that Boeing's [[Santa Susana Field Laboratory]], in the [[Simi Hills]] of eastern [[Ventura County]] in [[Southern California]], had been contaminated with [[toxic]] and [[radioactive waste]]. The study found that air, [[soil]], [[groundwater]], and [[surface water]] at the site all contained [[radionuclides]], toxic metals, and [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]]; air and water additionally contained [[perchlorate]], [[Trichloroethylene|TCE]], and [[hydrazines]], while water showed the presence of [[PCBs]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/erg/current.html |title=Center for Environmental Risk Reduction, UCLA |publisher=Ph.ucla.edu |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clean up studies and lawsuits are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acmela.org/rocketdyne.html |title=SSFL |publisher=Acmela.org |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtsc-ssfl.com/ |title=State DTSC-SSFL info website |publisher=Dtsc-ssfl.com |accessdate=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jet biofuels===
{{Main|Aviation biofuel|Algae fuel}}

The airline industry is responsible for about 11 percent of [[greenhouse gas]]es emitted by the U.S. transportation sector.&lt;ref name="boe_energy"/&gt; Aviation's share of the greenhouse gas emissions is poised to grow, as air travel increases and ground vehicles use more alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel.&lt;ref name="boe_energy"/&gt; Boeing estimates that biofuels could reduce flight-related greenhouse-gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent.&lt;ref name="boe_energy"/&gt; The solution blends algae fuels with existing jet fuel.&lt;ref name="boe_energy"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Ángel González|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/boeingaerospace/2003858756_boeingenergy30.html|title=To go green in jet fuel, Boeing looks at algae|work=The Seattle Times|date=August 30, 2007|accessdate=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeing executives said the company is informally collaborating with leading Brazilian biofuels maker [[Tecbio]], [[Aquaflow Bionomic]] of New Zealand and other fuel developers around the world. So far, Boeing has tested six fuels from these companies, and will probably have gone through 20 fuels "by the time we're done evaluating them".&lt;ref name="boe_energy"/&gt;  Boeing was also joining other aviation-related members in the [[Algal Biomass Organization]] (ABO) on June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/06/first-airlines.html First Airlines and UOP Join Algal Biomass Organization], Green Car Congress, June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Air New Zealand and Boeing are researching the [[jatropha]] plant to see if it is a sustainable alternative to conventional fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbonpositive.net/viewarticle.aspx?articleID=1114 Air NZ sees biofuel salvation in jatropha]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723191905/http://www.carbonpositive.net/viewarticle.aspx?articleID=1114 |date=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A two-hour test flight using a 50–50 mixture of the new biofuel with [[Jet fuel|Jet A-1]] in the number one position Rolls Royce RB-211 engine of 747-400 ZK-NBS, was successfully completed on December 30, 2008. The engine was then removed to be scrutinised and studied to identify any differences between the Jatropha blend and regular Jet A1. No effects to performances were found.

On August 31, 2010, Boeing worked with the U.S. Air Force to test the [[Boeing C-17]] running on 50&amp;nbsp;percent JP-8, 25&amp;nbsp;percent Hydro-treated Renewable Jet fuel and 25&amp;nbsp;percent of a Fischer–Tropsch fuel with successful results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123220027 |title=C-17 uses biofuel for flight tests |publisher=Edwards.af.mil |date=August 31, 2010 |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric propulsion===
For NASA's N+3 future airliner program, Boeing has determined that [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid electric engine technology]] is by far the best choice for its subsonic design. Hybrid electric propulsion has the potential to shorten takeoff distance and reduce noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/Features/2010/06/corp_envision_06_14_10.html |title=Boeing Feature Story: Envisioning tomorrow's aircraft |publisher=Boeing |date=August 16, 2010 |accessdate=May 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906062915/http://www.boeing.com/Features/2010/06/corp_envision_06_14_10.html |archivedate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4737">'''Bone meal''' is a mixture of finely and coarsely ground animal bones and slaughter-house waste products.&lt;ref name=Brigham&gt;{{cite web|last=Brigham and Women's Hospital|title=Bone Meal|url=http://healthlibrary.brighamandwomens.org/Library/Encyclopedia/19,BoneMeal|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used as an organic [[fertilizer]] for plants and as a nutritional supplement for animals. As a slow-release fertilizer, bone meal is primarily used as a source of [[phosphorus]] and protein.

==Uses==
=== Dietary supplements ===
Bone meal, along with a variety of other meals, especially meat meal, is used as a dietary/mineral supplement for [[livestock]]. It is used to feed [[monogastric]] animals with bone meal from [[ruminant]]s, and vice versa, to prevent the spread of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) or "mad cow disease". Proper heat control can reduce [[salmonella]] contaminants.&lt;ref name=Kentucky&gt;{{cite web|last=Animal Feed Resources Information System|first=University of Kentucky, College of Agriculture, Poultry Extension|title=Common Protein Sources for Poultry Diets|url=http://www.ca.uky.edu/smallflocks/Feed_ingredients/Proteins.html|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201041250/http://www.ca.uky.edu/smallflocks/feed_ingredients/proteins.html|archivedate=1 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bone meal once was often used as a [[Calcium#Dietary_supplements|human dietary calcium supplement]]. Research in the 1980s found that many bone meal preparations were contaminated with [[lead]] and other [[toxic metals]], and is no longer recommended as a calcium source.

=== Fertilizers ===
As a fertilizer, the [[N-P-K]] (Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium) ratio of bone meal can vary greatly, depending on the source. From a low of 3-15-0 to as high as 2-22-0. ,&lt;ref name=Card&gt;{{cite journal |last=Card |first=Adrian |author2=David Whiting |author3=Carl Wilson |author4=Jean Reeders |title=Organic Fertilizers |journal=Colorado State University Extension |date=December 2011 |volume=Colorado Master Gardener Program |issue=CMG Garden Notes |page=4 |url=http://cmg.colostate.edu/Gardennotes/234.pdf |accessdate=8 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721180346/http://cmg.colostate.edu/gardennotes/234.pdf# |archive-date=2011-07-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though some steamed bone meals have N-P-Ks of 1-13-0.{{citation needed|reason=The source doesn't support this claim|date=March 2016}} Bone meal is also an excellent source of calcium, but does not provide enough nitrogen to be beneficial to plants.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=L.|author2=J. Helenius|author3=A. Kangus |title=NJF Seminar 422: Meat bone meal as nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer (abstract)|journal=Nordic Association of Agricultural Scientists|year=2009|volume= 5|issue=2|page=26|url=http://orgprints.org/16174/1/fostering.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plants can only get phosphorus from bone meal if the [[soil pH]] is below 7.0 (acidic soil), according to recent [[Colorado State University]] research.&lt;ref name=Card /&gt;

====Mycorrhiza====
{{Off topic|date=March 2016}}
Organic fertilizers usually require the use of a variety of [[fungi]] in the soil to make the nutrients in the fertilizer [[bioavailable]] to the plant. For plants needing phosphorus, the fungi [[mycorrhiza]] penetrate the roots and break down the compounds containing the phosphorus for easier absorption and utilization, and in turn the plants supply the mycorrhizae with amino acids and sugars.&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite book|title=Stern's Introductory Plant Biology|year=2011|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=978-0-07-122212-9|pages=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The process was first suggested by [[Justus von Liebig]] (dissolving animal bones in sulphuric acid) around 1840 and first used in [[Great Britain|Britain]] by [[James Robertson (moderator)|Rev James Robertson]] in [[Ellon, Aberdeenshire]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Robertson,_James_(1803-1860)_(DNB00)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 19th century Europe, large scale production and international trade in bone manure was seen as essential for agricultural development.&lt;ref name="Sinclair1832"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir John Sinclair|title=The Code of Agriculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUdfKL8CyWoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA142|year=1832|publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert &amp; Piper|pages=141–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2603">On Sunday April 27, 2003, the Tank Barge '''Bouchard No. 120''' struck rocks south of [[Westport, Massachusetts]].  This resulted in a puncture of the barge's hull about twelve feet in length.  As a result, the cargo of the barge, number 6 fuel oil, spilled into the waters of [[Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts]].  While the spill was much smaller than many [[oil spills]], the environmental impacts were felt for years. Estimates of the total amount spilled range from 22,000 to 98,000 gallons of oil according to a publication by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/book_shelf/1289_ARD_Bouchard_1pager.pdf |title=Buzzards Bay Oil Spill in Massachusetts |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This spill was quite different from some of the more widely known spills like [[Deepwater Horizon]], not just because of its smaller scale, but due to the type of spill that it was. Deepwater, being a spill of oil directly from the ground was pure oil. Bouchard No. 120 contained number 6 [[fuel oil|Fuel_Oil]]. A local scientist from [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]] explains that the processing of oil yields various components of varying danger to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eldred |first=Rich |url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/bourne/local_news/x746872607 |title=Old oil spills keep on giving |location=Bourne, MA - |work=The Bourne Courier |date=2006-12-14 |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702083423/http://www.wickedlocal.com/bourne/local_news/x746872607 |archivedate=2010-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NOAA]] is heavily involved in environmental cleanups of oil spills as well as other damage to wildlife and coastal environments in the [[United States]] largely through their Damage Assessment Remediation and Recovery Program [[DARRP]]. efforts lasted in earnest for several years and continued to some degree until 2007 according to a report by the Buzzards Bay National Estuary Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dr. Joe |last=Costa |url=http://www.buzzardsbay.org/oilspill-status.htm |title=Buzzards Bay Oil Spill Cleanup Status |publisher=Buzzards Bay National Estuary Program |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cement-bonded wood fiber''' is a [[composite material]] manufactured throughout the world. It is made from wood (usually waste wood), chipped into a specially graded aggregate that is then [[mineralization (biology)|mineralized]] and combined with [[portland cement]].

== Uses ==

Cement-bonded wood fiber is used to manufacture a wide variety of products primarily for the construction industry (products like [[insulating concrete form]]s, siding materials and noise barriers). 

Cement bonded wood fiber materials can be classified as low density, medium density and high density. The density of the material will determine to a large extent, the various properties of the end product. Other factors determining the overall performance of a cement bonded wood fiber material are:

# Wood particle type
# Wood particle gradation
# cement to wood ratio
# Level of sugar content in the wood particle at the time of bonding

Most common is low-density cement bonded wood fiber. It is known for its use in [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified projects and other types of [[green building]]. The material itself is 100% recyclable, and is known for its insulating and acoustic properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10500">The '''rms charge radius''' is a measure of the size of an [[atomic nucleus]], particularly of a [[proton]] or a [[deuteron]]. It can be measured by the scattering of [[electron]]s by the nucleus and also [[inferred]] from the effects of finite nuclear size on electron energy levels as measured in [[Atomic spectrum|atomic spectra]].

==Definition==
The problem of defining a radius for the atomic nucleus is similar to the problem of [[atomic radius]], in that neither atoms nor their nuclei have definite boundaries. However, the nucleus can be [[scientific model|model]]ed as a sphere of positive charge for the interpretation of [[electron scattering]] experiments: because there is no definite boundary to the nucleus, the electrons "see" a range of cross-sections, for which a mean can be taken. The qualification of "rms" (for "[[root mean square]]") arises because it is the nuclear cross-section, proportional to the square of the radius, which is determining for electron scattering.

This definition of charge radius can also be applied to composite [[hadron]]s such as a [[proton]], [[neutron]], [[pion]], or [[kaon]], that are made up of more than one [[quark]].  In the case of an anti-matter baryon (e.g. an anti-proton), and some particles with a net zero [[electric charge]], the composite particle must be modeled as a sphere of negative rather than positive electric charge for the interpretation of electron scattering experiments.  In these cases, the square of the charge radius of the particle is defined to be negative, with the same absolute value with units of length squared equal to the positive squared charge radius that it would have had if it was identical in all other respects but each quark in the particle had the opposite electric charge (with the charge radius itself having a value that is an imaginary number with units of length).&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Abouzaid, et al., "A Measurement of the K0 Charge Radius and a CP Violating Asymmetry Together with a Search for CP Violating E1 Direct Photon Emission in the Rare Decay KL-&gt;pi+pi-e+e-", Phys. Rev. Lett. 96:101801 (2006) DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.101801 https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0508010 (determining that the neutral kaon has a negative mean squared charge radius of -0.077 ± 0.007(stat) ± 0.011(syst)fm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is customary when charge radius takes an imaginary numbered value to report the negative valued square of the charge radius, rather than the charge radius itself, for a particle.

The best known particle with a negative squared charge radius is the [[neutron]].  The heuristic explanation for why the squared charge radius of a neutron is negative, despite its overall neutral electric charge, is that this is the case because its negatively charged down quarks are, on average, located in the outer part of the neutron, while its positively charged up quark is, on average, located towards the center of the neutron.  This asymmetric distribution of charge within the particle gives rise to a small negative squared charge radius for the particle as a whole.  But, this is only the simplest of a variety of theoretical models, some of which are more elaborate, that are used to explain this property of a neutron.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., J. Byrne, "The mean square charge radius of the neutron", Neutron News Vol. 5, Issue 4, pg. 15-17 (1994) (comparing different theoretical explanations for the neutron's observed negative squared charge radius to the data) DOI:10.1080/10448639408217664 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10448639408217664#.U3GYaPldVUA&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[deuteron]]s and higher nuclei, it is conventional to distinguish between the scattering charge radius, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; (obtained from scattering data), and the bound-state charge radius, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, which includes the Darwin–Foldy term to account for the behaviour of the [[anomalous magnetic moment]] in an electromagnetic field&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = L.

==History==
{{main|Geiger–Marsden experiment}}
The first estimate of a nuclear charge radius was made by [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]]  in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Geiger | first1 = H. | authorlink1 = Hans Geiger | last2 = Marsden | first2 = E. | authorlink2 = Ernest Marsden | title = On a Diffuse Reflection of the α-Particles | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | year = 1909 | volume = 82 | pages = 495–500 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1909.0054 |bibcode = 1909RSPSA..82..495G }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  under the direction of [[Ernest Rutherford]] at the Physical Laboratories of the [[University of Manchester]], UK. The famous experiment involved the scattering of [[α-particle]]s by [[gold]] foil, with some of the particles being scattered through angles of more than 90°, that is coming back to the same side of the foil as the α-source. Rutherford was able to put an upper limit on the radius of the gold nucleus of 34 [[Femtometer#SI prefixed forms of metre|femtometres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Rutherford | first = E. | authorlink = Ernest Rutherford | title = The Scattering of α and β Particles by Matter and the Structure of the Atom | journal = Phil. Mag. |series=6th Series | year = 1911 | volume = 21 | pages = 669–88 | doi=10.1080/14786440508637080 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later studies found an empirical relation between the charge radius and the [[mass number]], ''A'', for heavier nuclei (''A''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 20):
:''R'' ≈ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''A''&lt;sup&gt;⅓&lt;/sup&gt;
where the empirical constant ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.2–1.5&amp;nbsp;fm can be interpreted as the proton radius. This gives a charge radius for the gold nucleus (''A''&amp;nbsp;= 197) of about 7.5&amp;nbsp;fm.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1 = John M. | last1 = Blatt | first2 = Victor F. | last2 = Weisskopf | title = Theoretical Nuclear Physics | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1952 | pages = 14–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern measurements==
Modern direct measurements are based on precision measurements of the atomic [[energy level]]s in hydrogen and deuterium, and measurements of [[electron scattering|scattering of electrons by nuclei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Sick | first = Ingo | year = 2003 | title = On the rms-radius of the proton | journal = Phys. Lett. B | volume = 576 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 62–67 | doi = 10.1016/j.physletb.2003.09.092|arxiv = nucl-ex/0310008 |bibcode = 2003PhLB..576...62S }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Sick | first1 = Ingo | first2 = Dirk | last2 = Trautmann | year = 1998 | title = On the rms radius of the deuteron | journal = Nucl. Phys. A | volume = 637 | issue = 4 | pages = 559–75 | doi = 10.1016/S0375-9474(98)00334-0|bibcode = 1998NuPhA.637..559S }}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is most interest in knowing the charge radii of [[proton]]s and [[deuteron]]s, as these can be compared with the spectrum of atomic [[hydrogen]]/[[deuterium]]: the nonzero size of the nucleus causes a shift in the electronic energy levels which shows up as a change in the frequency of the [[spectral line]]s.&lt;ref name="CODATA98"/&gt; Such comparisons are a [[Precision tests of QED|test]] of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED). Since 2002, the proton and deuteron charge radii have been independently refined parameters in the [[CODATA]] set of recommended values for physical constants, that is both scattering data and spectroscopic data are used to determine the recommended values.&lt;ref name="CODATA02"&gt;{{CODATA 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 CODATA recommended values are:
:proton:   ''R''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.8751(61)×10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; m
:deuteron: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.1413(25)×10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; m

Recent measurement of the [[Lamb shift]] in [[muonic hydrogen]] (an [[exotic atom]] consisting of a proton and a negative muon) indicates a significantly lower value for the proton charge radius, {{val|0.84087|(39)|u=fm}}: the reason for this discrepancy is not clear.&lt;ref name="Chargeradius"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Antognini | first1 = A. | last2 = Nez | first2 = F. | last3 = Schuhmann | first3 = K. | last4 = Amaro | first4 = F.

'''Copper(I) sulfide''' is a [[copper sulfide]], a chemical compound of [[copper]] and [[sulfur]]. It has the chemical compound Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. It is found in nature as the mineral [[chalcocite]]. It has a narrow range of stoichiometry ranging from Cu&lt;sub&gt;1.997&lt;/sub&gt;S to Cu&lt;sub&gt;2.000&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An electrochemical investigation of the system copper-sulfur|author=Potter,  R.

Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S can be prepared by heating copper strongly in sulfur vapour or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name ="Greenwood"/&gt; The reaction of copper powder in molten sulfur rapidly produces Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, whereas pellets of copper require much higher temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The formation of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S from the elements I.

In the production of copper two thirds of the molten copper sulfide is oxidised as above, and the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O reacts with unoxidised Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S to give Cu metal:&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt;

[[Image:Dendrites01.jpg|thumb|Manganese dendrites on a limestone bedding plane from [[Solnhofen]], Germany. Scale in mm.]]
A crystal '''dendrite''' is a crystal that develops with a typical multi-branching ''tree-like'' form. Dendritic crystal growth is very common and illustrated by [[snowflake]] formation and [[frost]] patterns on a window. [[wikt:dendritic|Dendritic]] crystallization forms a natural [[fractal]] pattern.  Dendritic crystals can grow into a supercooled pure liquid or form from growth instabilities that occur when the growth rate is limited by the rate of diffusion of solute atoms to the interface.  In the latter case, there must be a concentration gradient from the supersaturated value in the solution to the concentration in equilibrium with the crystal at the surface.  Any protuberance that develops is accompanied by a steeper concentration gradients at its tip.  This increases the diffusion rate to the tip.  In opposition to this is the action of the surface tension tending to flatten the protuberance and setting up a flux of solute atoms from the protuberance out to the sides.  However, overall, the protuberance becomes amplified.  This process occurs again and again until a dendrite is produced.

The term "dendrite" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''dendron (δενδρον)'', which means "tree".

==Mineralogy and paleontology==
[[Image:Pyrolusite Mineral with Dendrite Macro Digon3.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a dendrite on pyrolusite.]]
In [[paleontology]], dendritic mineral crystal forms are often mistaken for [[fossil]]s. These [[pseudofossil]]s form as naturally occurring fissures in the rock are filled by percolating mineral solutions. They form when water rich in [[manganese]] and [[iron]] flows along fractures and bedding planes between layers of [[limestone]] and other rock types, depositing dendritic crystals as the solution flows through. A variety of manganese oxides and hydroxides are involved &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=R.M|last2=Rossman|first2=G.R.|date=1979|title=The mineralogy of manganese dendrites and coatings|url=|journal=American Mineralogist|volume=64|pages=1219-1226|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including:
* [[birnessite]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;·9H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)
* [[coronadite]] (PbMn&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[cryptomelane]] (KMn&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[hollandite]] (BaMn&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[romanechite]] ((Ba,H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)Mn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[todorokite]] ((Ba,Mn,Mg,Ca,K,Na)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and others.

A three-dimensional form of dendrite develops in fissures in [[quartz]], forming moss [[agate]].

The Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE) is a [[materials science]] solidification experiment that researchers use on [[Space Shuttle]] missions to investigate dendritic growth in an environment where the effect of gravity (convection in the liquid) can be excluded. Dendritic solidification is one of the most common forms of solidifying metals and alloys. When materials crystallize or solidify under certain conditions, they freeze unstably, resulting in dendritic forms. Scientists are particularly interested in dendrite size, shape, and how the branches of the dendrites interact with each other.{{cn|date=March 2016}} These characteristics largely determine the properties of the material.{{update after|2016|3|8}}

The initial low cost forecasts for these [[megaprojects]] exhibited "[[optimism bias]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mancini, Mauro and Locatelli, Giorgio and Sainati, Tristano (2015).

[[Nuclear Energy Agency]], pp. 177–188.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Nuclear power plant|New nuclear power plants]] typically have high capital costs for building the first several plants, after which costs tend to fall for each additional plant built as the supply chains develop and the regulatory processes improve. Fuel, operational, and maintenance costs are relatively small components of the total cost. The long service life and high productivity of nuclear power plants allow sufficient funds for ultimate [[nuclear decommissioning|plant decommissioning]] and waste storage and management to be accumulated, with little impact on the price per unit of electricity generated. Additionally, measures to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]] [[climate change]] such as a [[carbon tax]] or [[carbon emissions trading]], would favor the economics of nuclear power over fossil fuel power.

Nuclear power construction costs have varied significantly across the world and in time. 
Massive and rapid increases in cost occurred in the 1970s, especially in the United States. 
A single study has claimed that these cost increases are specific to the United States.&lt;ref name="Energy Policy journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovering|first1=J|last2=Yip|first2=A|last3=Nordhaus|first3=T|title=Historical construction costs of global nuclear power reactors|journal=Energy Policy|date=April 2016|volume=91|pages=371–382|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2016.01.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, it has been criticized for the selective use of data and biased interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2016.04.001 |title=Cost overruns and financial risk in the construction of nuclear power reactors: A critical appraisal |journal=Energy Policy |volume=102 |pages=644–649 |year=2017 |last1=Gilbert |first1=Alexander |last2=Sovacool |first2=Benjamin K |last3=Johnstone |first3=Phil |last4=Stirling |first4=Andy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There were no construction starts of nuclear power reactors between 1979 and 2012 in the United States, and since then more new reactor attempts have gone through bankruptcy than be completed.
Recent cost trends in countries such as Japan and Korea have been very different, including periods of stability and decline in costs.

In more economically developed countries, a slowdown in electricity demand growth in recent years has made large-scale power infrastructure investments difficult. Very large upfront costs and long project cycles carry large risks, including political decision making and intervention such as regulatory ratcheting.&lt;ref name=kidd2011 /&gt; In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find financing, notably [[Belene Nuclear Power Plant|Belene]] in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at [[Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant|Cernavoda]] in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out.&lt;ref name=kidd2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&amp;storyCode=2058653 |title=New reactors—more or less? |author=Kidd, Steve |date=January 21, 2011 |work=Nuclear Engineering International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212195417/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&amp;storyCode=2058653 |archivedate=2011-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for clean energy projects.&lt;ref name=kidd2011 /&gt; Former Exelon CEO [[John Rowe (Exelon)|John Rowe]] said in 2012 that new nuclear plants in the United States "don't make any sense right now" and would not be economic as long as gas prices remain low.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;Jeff McMahon, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2012/03/29/exelons-nuclear-guy-no-new-nukes/ "Exelon's nuclear guy: no new nukes"], Forbes 29 Mar. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Current bids for new nuclear power plants in China have fallen below $2000/kW in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/china-nuclear-power.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; as China continues accelerating its new build program after a pause following the Fukushima disaster. 
Therefore, comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants.

Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties. To date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by [[Nationalized|state-owned]] or [[Regulated market|regulated]] [[Electric utility|utility monopolies]]&lt;ref name="ft-20100912"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ad15fcfe-bc71-11df-a42b-00144feab49a.html |title=Nuclear: New dawn now seems limited to the east |author=Ed Crooks |publisher=Financial Times |date=12 September 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NERA-20120316"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elliott.gwu.edu/assets/docs/events/kee-0312.pdf |title=Future of Nuclear Energy |author=Edward Kee |publisher=NERA Economic Consulting |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=2 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000713/http://elliott.gwu.edu/assets/docs/events/kee-0312.pdf |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where many of the risks associated with political change and regulatory ratcheting were borne by consumers rather than suppliers. Many countries have now liberalized the [[electricity market]] where these risks, and the risk of cheap competition from subsidised energy sources emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the risk of investing in new nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name="MIT-2003"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/ |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-615-12420-9 |accessdate=2006-11-10 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the four [[European Pressurized Reactor|EPRs]] under construction (the [[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Finland]] and [[Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant|Flamanville]] in [[France]]), which are the latest new builds in Europe, are significantly behind schedule and substantially over cost.&lt;ref name="Patel"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-24/china-builds-french-designed-nuclear-reactor-for-40-less-areva-ceo-says.html | title= China Builds Nuclear Reactor for 40% Less Than Cost in France, Areva Says | first= Tara | last= Patel |author2=Francois de Beaupuy |date= 24 November 2010 |publisher= [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | accessdate= 2011-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following the 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], costs are likely to go up for some types of currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to new requirements for on-site [[spent fuel]] management and elevated design basis threats.&lt;ref name="Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2011 xv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/mitei/research/studies/documents/nuclear-fuel-cycle/The_Nuclear_Fuel_Cycle-all.pdf |title=The Future of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2011 |page=xv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:OL3.jpg|thumb|[[Olkiluoto 3]] under construction in 2009. It is the first [[European Pressurized Reactor|EPR]] design, but problems with workmanship and supervision have created costly delays which led to an inquiry by the Finnish nuclear regulator [[Säteilyturvakeskus|STUK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Olkiluoto pipe welding 'deficient', says regulator | publisher = World Nuclear News | date = 16 October 2009 | url = http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Olkiluoto_pipe_welding_deficient_says_regulator-1610095.html | accessdate =8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2012, Areva estimated that the full cost of building the reactor will be about €8.5 billion, or almost three times the original delivery price of €3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Finnish parliament agrees plans for two reactors | agency = [[Reuters]] | last = Kinnunen | first = Terhi | date = 2010-07-01 | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKLDE6600ED | accessdate = 2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WNN-2012-07-17"&gt;{{cite news | title = Olkiluoto 3 delayed beyond 2014 | publisher = [[World Nuclear News]] | date = 17 July 2012 | url = http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Olkiluoto_3_delayed_beyond_2014-1707124.html | accessdate = 24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Finland's Olkiluoto 3 nuclear plant delayed again | publisher = BBC | date = 16 July 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18862422 | accessdate = 10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although the price of new plants in China is falling rapidly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/china-nuclear-power.aspx|title=China Nuclear Power – Chinese Nuclear Energy – World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; approaching $1500/kW (or about a fifth of the cost of some plants currently being built in Europe), [[John Quiggin]], an economics professor, maintains that the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically viable.&lt;ref name="John Quiggin"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/08/reviving-nuclear-power-debates-is-a-distraction-we-need-to-use-less-energy |title=Reviving nuclear power debates is a distraction.

Professor of science and technology [[Ian Lowe]] has also challenged the economics of nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/conference/economic-growth-climate-change-g20/speakers/ian-lowe|title=Ian Lowe|publisher=Griffith.edu.au|date=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/no-nukes-now-or-ever-20110319-1c1ed.html |title=No nukes now, or ever |author=Ian Lowe  |date=March 20, 2011 |work=The Age |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nuclear supporters continue to point to the historical success of nuclear power across the world, and they call for new reactors in their own countries, including proposed new but largely uncommercialised designs, as a source of new power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2013/11/10/new-build-nuclear-is-dead-morningstar/ |title=New-Build Nuclear Is Dead: Morningstar |author=Jeff  McMahon |date=10 November 2013  |work=Forbes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2011/03/18/18greenwire-former-nrc-member-says-renaissance-is-dead-for-n-961.html |title=Former NRC Member Says Renaissance is Dead, for Now |author=Hannah Northey |date=18 March 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/28/nuclear-lobbyists-senior-civil-servants |title=Nuclear lobbyists wined and dined senior civil servants, documents show |author=Leo Hickman  |date=28 November 2012  |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thebulletin.org/2008/september/campaign-sell-nuclear |title=The Campaign to Sell Nuclear |author=Diane Farseta  |date=September 1, 2008 |volume=64 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages=38–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Leake.

Many countries, including Russia, South Korea, India, and China, have continued to pursue new builds. Globally, 71 nuclear power plants were under construction in 15 countries as of January 2015, according to the [[IAEA]].&lt;ref name="IAEA PRIS database"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/pris/home.aspx|title=PRIS – Home|website=www.iaea.org|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has 25 reactors under construction but,&lt;ref name="Nuclear Power in China"&gt;World Nuclear Association (December 10, 2010).

Sep. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; according to a government research unit, China must not build "too many nuclear power reactors too quickly", in order to avoid a shortfall of fuel, equipment and qualified plant workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-11/china-should-control-pace-of-reactor-construction-outlook-says.html |title=China Should Control Pace of Reactor Construction, Outlook Says |date=January 11, 2011 |work=Bloomberg News  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Nuclear Association]], the global trend is for new nuclear power stations coming online to be balanced by the number of old plants being retired.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Nuclear Association]], "[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide/ Plans for New Reactors Worldwide]", October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; But this worrying lack of development is limited to certain regions and may change once societies consider the importance of ample low cost and clean energy for their economies and quality of life.

In the United States, nuclear power faces competition from the low natural gas prices in North America. Former Exelon CEO [[John Rowe (Exelon)|John Rowe]] said in 2012 that new nuclear plants in the United States "don’t make any sense right now" and won’t be economic as long as the natural gas glut persists.&lt;ref name="forbes.com" /&gt;  In 2016, [[Governor of New York]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] directed the [[New York Public Service Commission]] to consider ratepayer-financed [[Nuclear power debate#Subsidies|subsidies]] similar to those for renewable sources to keep nuclear power stations profitable in the competition against natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/nyregion/nuclear-subsidies-new-york-clean-energy-plan.html |title=Nuclear Subsidies Are Key Part of New York’s Clean-Energy Plan |first=Vivian |last=Yee |date=July 20, 2016 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/MatterManagement/CaseMaster.aspx?MatterCaseNo=15-E-0302&amp;submit=Search+by+Case+Number|title=NYSDPS-DMM: Matter Master|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capital costs ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The usual rule of thumb for nuclear power is that about two thirds of the generation cost is accounted for by fixed costs, the main ones being the cost of paying interest on the loans and repaying the capital..." &lt;ref name="The Doomsday Machine 2012 page 89"&gt;The Doomsday Machine, Cohen and McKillop (Palgrave 2012) page 89&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Capital cost, the building and financing of nuclear power plants, represents a large percentage of the cost of nuclear electricity. In 2014, the US Energy Information Administration estimated that for new nuclear plants going online in 2019, capital costs will make up 74% of the levelized cost of electricity; higher than the capital percentages for fossil-fuel power plants (63% for coal, 22% for natural gas), and lower than the capital percentages for some other nonfossil-fuel sources (80% for wind, 88% for solar PV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm |title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) – Source |publisher=Eia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areva, the French nuclear plant operator, offers that 70% of the cost of a kWh of nuclear electricity is accounted for by the fixed costs from the construction process.&lt;ref name="The Doomsday Machine 2012 page 89" /&gt;  Some analysts argue (for example Steve Thomas, Professor of Energy Studies at the University of Greenwich in the UK, quoted in the book [[The Doomsday Machine (2012 book)|The Doomsday Machine]] by Martin Cohen and Andrew McKillop) that what is often not appreciated in debates about the economics of nuclear power is that the cost of equity, that is companies using their own money to pay for new plants, is generally higher than the cost of debt.&lt;ref name="The Doomsday Machine 2012 page 199"&gt;The Doomsday Machine, Cohen and McKillop (Palgrave 2012) page 199&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of borrowing may be that "once large loans have been arranged at low interest rates – perhaps with government support – the money can then be lent out at higher rates of return".&lt;ref name="The Doomsday Machine 2012 page 199" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"One of the big problems with nuclear power is the enormous upfront cost. These reactors are extremely expensive to build. While the returns may be very great, they're also very slow. It can sometimes take decades to recoup initial costs. Since many investors have a short attention span, they don't like to wait that long for their investment to pay off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/02/why-are-new-us-nuclear-reactor-projects-fizzling/70591/ |title=Why Are New U.S. Nuclear Reactor Projects Fizzling? |author=Indiviglio, Daniel |date=February 1, 2011 |work=The Atlantic }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of the large capital costs for the initial nuclear power plants built as part of a sustained build program, and the relatively long construction period before revenue is returned, [[Cost of capital|servicing the capital costs]] of first few nuclear power plants can be the most important factor determining the economic competitiveness of nuclear energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.anl.gov/Special_Reports/NuclEconSumAug04.pdf#page=13 |title=The Economic Future of Nuclear Power |author1=George S.

The recent liberalization of the [[electricity market]] in many countries has made the economics of nuclear power generation less attractive,&lt;ref name="wnn-20150204"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/V-Can-nuclear-succeed-in-liberalized-power-markets-0420152.html |title=Can nuclear succeed in liberalized power markets? |author=Edward Kee |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=4 February 2015 |accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.electricitypolicy.org.uk/pubs/wp/eprg0619.pdf |format=PDF |title=Using Probabilistic Analysis to Value Power Generation Investments under Uncertainty |author1=Fabien A.

As states are declining to finance nuclear power plants, the sector is now much more reliant on the commercial banking sector. According to research done by Dutch banking research group Profundo, commissioned by [[BankTrack]], in 2008 private banks invested almost €176 billion in the nuclear sector. Champions were [[BNP Paribas]], with more than €13,5 billion in nuclear investments and [[Citigroup]] and [[Barclays]] on par with both over €11,4 billion in investments. Profundo added up investments in eighty companies in over 800 financial relationships with 124 banks in the following sectors: construction, electricity, [[Uranium mining|mining]], the [[nuclear fuel cycle]] and "other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearbanks.org |title=Nuclear banks? No thanks! |publisher=Nuclearbanks.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost overruns ===
Construction delays can add significantly to the cost of a plant. Because a power plant does not earn income and currencies can inflate during construction, longer construction times translate directly into higher finance charges. Modern nuclear power plants are planned for construction in five years or less (42 months for [[CANDU]] ACR-1000, 60 months from order to operation for an [[AP1000]], 48 months from first concrete to operation for an [[European Pressurized Reactor|EPR]] and 45 months for an [[ESBWR]])&lt;ref name="schedule"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/050/documents/26586/26586E.pdf|title=Bruce Power New build Project Environmental Assessment – Round One Open House (Appendix B2)|accessdate=2007-04-23|publisher=Bruce Power|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to over a decade for some previous plants.  However, despite Japanese success with [[ABWR]]s, two of the four [[European Pressurized Reactor|EPRs]] under construction (in [[Finland]] and [[France]]) are significantly behind schedule.&lt;ref name="Patel" /&gt;

In the United States many new regulations were put in place in the years before and again immediately after the [[Three Mile Island accident]]'s partial meltdown, resulting in plant startup delays of many years.  The NRC has new regulations in place now (see [[Combined Construction and Operating License]]), and the next plants will have NRC Final Design Approval before the customer buys them, and a Combined Construction and Operating License will be issued before construction starts, guaranteeing that if the plant is built as designed then it will be allowed to operate—thus avoiding lengthy hearings after completion.

In [[Japan]] and [[France]], construction costs and delays are significantly diminished because of streamlined government licensing and certification procedures. In France, one model of reactor was type-certified, using a [[safety engineering]] process similar to the process used to certify aircraft models for safety. That is, rather than licensing individual reactors, the regulatory agency certified a particular design and its construction process to produce safe reactors. U.S. law permits type-licensing of reactors, a process which is being used on the [[AP1000]] and the [[ESBWR]].&lt;ref name="nustart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/01-11-2006/0004246911&amp;EDATE= |title=NuStart Energy Picks Enercon for New Nuclear Power Plant License Applications for a GE ESBWR and a Westinghouse AP 1000 |accessdate=2006-11-10 |publisher=PRNewswire |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], cost overruns for the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station]], largely due to delays and policy changes, are often cited by opponents of new reactors. Construction started in 1981 at an estimated cost of $7.4 Billion 1993-adjusted CAD, and finished in 1993 at a cost of $14.5 billion.  70% of the price increase was due to interest charges incurred due to delays imposed to postpone units 3 and 4, 46% inflation over a 4-year period and other changes in financial policy.&lt;ref name=canadanuclearfaqCB&gt;{{cite web|title = Costs and Benefits | url=http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionC.htm#darlington | accessdate=2011-01-05 | year = 2011 | publisher=The Canadian Nuclear FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; No new nuclear reactor has since been built in Canada, although a few have been and are undergoing refurbishment and environment assessment is complete for 4 new generation stations at Darlington with the Ontario government committed in keeping a nuclear base load of 50% or around 10GW.

In the United Kingdom and the United States cost overruns on nuclear plants contributed to the bankruptcies of  several utility companies. In the United States these losses helped usher in energy deregulation in the mid-1990s that saw rising electricity rates and power blackouts in California. When the UK began privatizing utilities, its nuclear reactors "were so unprofitable they could not be sold." Eventually in 1996, the government gave them away. But the company that took them over, British Energy, had to be bailed out in 2004 to the extent of 3.4 billion pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/159997/nuclear-dead-end-its-economics-stupid |title=Nuclear Dead End: It's the Economics, Stupid |author=Christian Parenti  |date=April 18, 2011 |work=The Nation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operating costs ==
In general, coal and nuclear plants have the same types of operating costs (operations and maintenance plus fuel costs). However, nuclear has lower fuel costs but higher operating and maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="NRC Information Digest 2006-2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1350/ |title=NUREG-1350 Vol. 18: NRC Information Digest 2006–2007 |accessdate=2007-01-22 |publisher=Nuclear Regulatory Commission |year=2006 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fuel costs ===
Nuclear plants require [[nuclear fission|fissile]] fuel.  Generally, the fuel used is [[uranium]], although other materials may be used (See [[MOX fuel]]). In 2005, prices on the world market for uranium averaged [[US$]]20/lb (US$44.09/kg). On 2007-04-19, prices reached US$113/lb (US$249.12/kg).&lt;ref name=cnnmoney&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2007/04/19/markets/uranium/index.htm What's behind the red-hot uranium boom], 2007-04-19, [http://money.cnn.com/ CNNMoney], Retrieved 2008-07-2&lt;/ref&gt; On 2008-07-02, the price had dropped to $59/lb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uxc.com/review/uxc_Prices.aspx|title=UxC Nuclear Fuel Price Indicators (Delayed)|publisher=Ux Consulting Company, LLC|accessdate= 2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuel costs account for about 28% of a nuclear plant's operating expenses.&lt;ref name=cnnmoney /&gt;  As of 2013, half the cost of reactor fuel was taken up by enrichment and fabrication, so that the cost of the uranium concentrate raw material was 14 percent of operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf02.html|title=The Economics of Nuclear Power|date=February 2014|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doubling the price of uranium would add about 10% to the cost of electricity produced in existing nuclear plants, and about half that much to the cost of electricity in future power plants.&lt;ref&gt;World Nuclear, [http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Economic-Aspects/Economics-of-Nuclear-Power/ Economics of nuclear power], Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of raw uranium contributes about $0.0015/kWh to the cost of nuclear electricity, while in breeder reactors the uranium cost falls to $0.000015/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1109/EICCCC.2006.277268 |chapter=Nuclear Fission Fuel is Inexhaustible |title=2006 IEEE EIC Climate Change Conference |pages=1–8 |year=2006 |last1=Lightfoot |first1=H.

As of 2008, mining activity was growing rapidly, especially from smaller companies, but putting a uranium deposit into production takes 10 years or more.&lt;ref name=cnnmoney /&gt;  The world's present measured resources of uranium, economically recoverable at a price of 130&amp;nbsp;USD/kg according to the industry groups [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[Nuclear Energy Agency]] (NEA) and [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), are enough to last for "at least a century" at current consumption rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.fr/html/general/press/2008/2008-02.html|title=Uranium resources sufficient to meet projected nuclear energy requirements long into the future|date=3 June 2008|publisher=[[Nuclear Energy Agency]] (NEA)|accessdate= 2008-06-16 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081205121250/http://www.nea.fr/html/general/press/2008/2008-02.html | archivedate=5 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Nuclear Association]], "the world's present measured resources of uranium (5.7 Mt) in the cost category less than three times present spot prices and used only in conventional reactors, are enough to last for about 90 years. This represents a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. Further exploration and higher prices will certainly, on the basis of present geological knowledge, yield further resources as present ones are used up." The amount of uranium present in all currently known conventional reserves alone (excluding the huge quantities of currently-uneconomical uranium present in "unconventional" reserves such as phosphate/phosphorite deposits, seawater, and other sources) is enough to last over 200 years at current consumption rates. Fuel efficiency in conventional reactors has increased over time. Additionally, since 2000, 12–15% of world uranium requirements have been met by the dilution of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium from the decommissioning of nuclear weapons and related military stockpiles with depleted uranium, natural uranium, or partially-enriched uranium sources to produce low-enriched uranium for use in commercial power reactors. Similar efforts have been utilizing weapons-grade plutonium to produce mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, which is also produced from reprocessing used fuel. Other components of used fuel are currently less commonly utilized, but have a substantial capacity for reuse, especially so in next-generation fast neutron reactors. Over 35 European reactors are licensed to use MOX fuel, as well as Russian and American nuclear plants. Reprocessing of used fuel increases utilization by approximately 30%, while the widespread use of fast breeder reactors would allow for an increase of "50-fold or more" in utilization.&lt;ref name="wna-supply-of-uranium"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uranium Supplies: Supply of Uranium – World Nuclear Association|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/supply-of-uranium.aspx|website=www.world-nuclear.org|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wna-processing-of-used-nuclear-fuel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Processing of Used Nuclear Fuel – World Nuclear Association|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/fuel-recycling/processing-of-used-nuclear-fuel.aspx|website=www.world-nuclear.org|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wna-military-warheads"&gt;{{cite web|title=Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel {{!}} Megatons to MegaWatts – World Nuclear Association|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel.aspx|website=www.world-nuclear.org|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waste disposal costs ===
{{Main|Radioactive waste}}
All nuclear plants produce radioactive waste. To pay for the cost of storing, transporting and disposing these wastes in a permanent location, in the United States a surcharge of a tenth of a [[United States dollar|cent]] per kilowatt-hour is added to electricity bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sustainablenuclear.org/PADs/pad0211avoiland.html |title=Safe Transportation of Spent Nuclear Fuel |publisher=Sustainablenuclear.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610051429/http://www.sustainablenuclear.org/PADs/pad0211avoiland.html |archivedate=2016-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roughly one percent of electrical utility bills in provinces using nuclear power are diverted to fund nuclear waste disposal in Canada.&lt;ref name = canadanuclearfaqWM&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionE.htm | title=Waste Management|publisher=Nuclearfaq.ca | accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration announced that the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] would no longer be considered the answer for U.S. civilian nuclear waste.  Currently, there is no plan for disposing of the waste and plants will be required to keep the waste on the plant premises indefinitely.

The disposal of [[low level waste]] reportedly costs around £2,000/m³ in the UK. [[High level waste]] costs somewhere between £67,000/m³ and £201,000/m³.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2049209]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404063448/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2049209|date=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; General division is 80%/20% of low level/high level waste,&lt;ref name=Europa&gt;{{cite news |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l27048.htm |title=Management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste |publisher=Europa.

In Canada, the [[Nuclear Waste Management Organization (Canada)|NWMO]] was created in 2002 to oversee long term disposal of nuclear waste, and in 2007 adopted the Adapted Phased Management procedure.  Long term management is subject to change based on technology and public opinion, but currently largely follows the recommendations for a centralized repository as first extensively outlined in by AECL in 1988.  It was determined after extensive review that following these recommendations would safely isolate the waste from the biosphere.  The location has not yet been determined, and the project is expected to cost between $9 and $13 billion CAD for construction and operation for 60–90 years, employing roughly a thousand people for the duration.  Funding is available and has been collected since 1978 under the Canadian Nuclear Fuel Waste Management Program.  Very long term monitoring requires less staff since high-level waste is less toxic than naturally occurring uranium ore deposits within a few centuries.&lt;ref name=canadanuclearfaqWM /&gt;

The primary argument for pursuing IFR-style technology today is that it provides the best solution to the existing nuclear waste problem because fast reactors can be fueled from the waste products of existing reactors as well as from the plutonium used in weapons, as is the case of the discontinued [[EBR-II]] in Arco, Idaho, and in the operating, as of 2014, [[BN-800 reactor]]. [[Depleted uranium]] (DU) waste can also be used as fuel in fast reactors.  Waste produced by a fast-neutron reactor and a pyroelectric refiner would consist only of fission products, which are produced at a rate of about one tonne per GWe-year.  This is 5% as much as present reactors produce, and needs special custody for only 300 years instead of 300,000.  Only 9.2% of fission products ([[strontium]] and [[caesium]]) contribute 99% of radiotoxicity; at some additional cost, these could be separated, reducing the disposal problem by a further factor of ten.

=== Decommissioning ===
{{Main|Nuclear decommissioning}}
At the end of a nuclear plant's lifetime, the plant must be decommissioned. This entails either dismantling, safe storage or entombment. In the United States, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) requires plants to finish the process within 60 years of closing. Since it may cost $500 million or more to shut down and decommission a plant, the NRC requires plant owners to set aside money when the plant is still operating to pay for the future shutdown costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/decommissioning.html Decommissioning a Nuclear Power Plant], 2007-4-20, [http://www.nrc.gov/ U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission], Retrieved 2007-6-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Decommissioning a reactor that has undergone a meltdown is inevitably more difficult and expensive. Three Mile Island was decommissioned 14 years after its incident for $837 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/decommissioning/power-reactor/three-mile-island-unit-2.html |title=NRC: Three Mile Island – Unit 2 |publisher=Nrc.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the [[Fukushima disaster cleanup]] is not yet known, but has been estimated to cost around $100 billion.&lt;ref name="guardian-20130306"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/06/fukushima-nuclear-decommissioning-plant-safety |title=Fukushima two years on: the largest nuclear decommissioning finally begins |author=Justin McCurry |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=23 April 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chernobyl is not yet decommissioned, different estimates put the end date between 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/chernobyl-nuclear-plant-to-be-decommissioned-compl-65096.html |title=Chernobyl nuclear plant to be decommissioned completely by 2013 |publisher=Kyivpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=13304&amp;LangType=2057 |title=Decommissioning at Chernobyl |publisher=World-nuclear-news.org |date=2007-04-26 |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proliferation and terrorism ===
{{See also|Vulnerability of nuclear plants to attack}}
A 2011 report for the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] stated that "the costs of preventing [[nuclear proliferation]] and [[Nuclear terrorism|terrorism]] should be recognized as negative externalities of civilian nuclear power, thoroughly evaluated, and integrated into economic assessments—just as global warming emissions are increasingly identified as a cost in the economics of coal-fired electricity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear_subsidies_report.pdf |title=Nuclear Power:Still Not Viable without Subsidies |author=Koplow, Doug |date=February 2011 |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a country pursues civilian nuclear power, it is often indistinguishable whether the country's motives are honest or if it is a cover for a weapons program.{{cn|date=August 2018}} 
The same facilities being used for uranium enrichment for reactor fuel can also be used to enrich uranium for weapons.  In 2018 when North Korea turned on a "power" reactor, there was uncertainty in defense circles whether it was for power use or plutonium production: ""Rob Munks, editor of Jane's Intelligence Review, says the light-water reactor "could be used for civilian electricity generation -- its stated purpose -- or diverted towards the nuclear program.""

"Construction of the ELWR was completed in 2013 and is optimized for civilian electricity production, but it has "dual-use" potential and can be modified to produce material for nuclear weapons."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/15/asia/north-korea-nuclear-reactors-activity/index.html{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tschernobyl-Fukushima-Gedenken Wien2011-04-25 2000 Kerzen.jpg|thumb|2000 candles in memory of the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986, at a commemoration 25 years after the nuclear accident, as well as for the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] of 2011.]]

[[Nuclear safety and security]] is a chief goal of the nuclear industry. Great care is taken so that accidents are avoided, and if unpreventable, have limited consequences. Accidents could stem from system failures related to faulty construction or pressure vessel embrittlement due to prolonged radiation exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Odette|first=G|author2=Lucas|title=Embrittlement of Nuclear Reactor Pressure Vessels|journal=JOM|year=2001|volume=53|issue=7|pages=18–22|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/0107/Odette-0107.html|accessdate=2 January 2014|doi=10.1007/s11837-001-0081-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with any aging technology, risks of failure increase over time, and since many currently operating nuclear reactors were built in the mid 20th century, care must be taken to ensure proper operation. Many more recent reactor designs have been proposed, most of which include passive safety systems. These design considerations serve to significantly mitigate or totally prevent major accidents from occurring, even in the event of a system failure. Still, reactors must be designed, built, and operated properly to minimize accident risks.&lt;ref name=globen /&gt; The [[Timeline of the Fukushima nuclear accidents|Fukushima]] disaster represents one instance where these systems were not comprehensive enough, where the tsunami following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]] disabled the backup generators that were stabilizing the reactor.&lt;ref name="Hugh Gusterson"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |title=The lessons of Fukushima  |author=Hugh Gusterson  |date=16 March 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606023005/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |archivedate=6 June 2013  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DIAZMAURIN2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Diaz Maurin |first=François |date=26 March 2011 |title=Fukushima: Consequences of Systemic Problems in Nuclear Plant Design |journal=Economic &amp; Political Weekly |volume=46 |issue=13 |pages=10–12 |url=https://uab.academia.edu/Fran%C3%A7oisDiazMaurin/Papers/848047/Fukushima_Consequences_of_Systemic_Problems_in_Nuclear_Plant_Design }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UBS]] AG, the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-nuclear-power-industry-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |title=Fukushima Crisis Worse for Atomic Power Than Chernobyl, UBS Says |author=James Paton |date=April 4, 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.&lt;ref name=globen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z.  |author2=Delucchi, Mark A. |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy |page=6 }}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An interdisciplinary team from MIT estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 to 2055, at least four [[core damage]] incidents would be expected in that period (assuming only ''current'' designs were used – the number of incidents expected in that same time period with the use of advanced designs is only one).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-full.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2003 |page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, there have been five core damage incidents in the world since 1970 (one at [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] in 1979; one at [[Chernobyl]] in 1986; and three at [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima-Daiichi]] in 2011), corresponding to the beginning of the operation of [[generation II reactor]]s.&lt;ref name="DIAZMAURIN2011" /&gt;

According to the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]], the Chernobyl incident is the only incident ever to have caused any fatalities.  The report that [[UNSCEAR]] presented to the UN General Assembly in 2011 states that 29 plant workers and emergency responders died from effects of radiation exposure, two died from causes related to the incident but unrelated to radiation, and one died from coronary thrombosis.  It attributed fifteen cases of fatal thyroid cancer to the incident.  It said there is no evidence the incident caused an ongoing increase in incidence of solid tumors or blood cancers in Eastern Europe.  With 46 deaths in its entire six-decade worldwide history, nuclear power remains the safest-ever way to make electricity, by a very wide margin.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

In terms of nuclear accidents, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] have claimed that "reactor owners ... have never been economically responsible for the full costs and risks of their operations. Instead, the public faces the prospect of severe losses in the event of any number of potential adverse scenarios, while private investors reap the rewards if nuclear plants are economically successful. For all practical purposes, nuclear power's economic gains are privatized, while its risks are socialized".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear_subsidies_report.pdf |title=Nuclear Power:Still Not Viable without Subsidies |author=Koplow, Doug |date=February 2011 |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the problem of insurance costs for worst-case scenarios is not unique to nuclear power: [[hydroelectric power]] plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the [[Banqiao Dam]] disaster, where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died, or large [[dam failure]]s in general.&lt;ref name="damsafety.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.damsafety.org/media/Documents/FEMA/AvailabilityOfDamInsurance.pdf |format=PDF |title=Availability of Dam Insurance |publisher=Damsafety.org |accessdate=2015-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108185336/http://www.damsafety.org/media/documents/fema/availabilityofdaminsurance.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Private insurers base dam insurance premiums on worst-case scenarios, so insurance for major disasters in this sector is likewise provided by the state.&lt;ref name="damsafety.org" /&gt; In the US, insurance coverage for nuclear reactors is provided by the combination of operator-purchased private insurance and the primarily operator-funded [[Price Anderson Act]].

Any effort to construct a new nuclear facility around the world, whether an existing design or an experimental future design, must deal with [[NIMBY]] or NIABY objections.  Because of the high profiles of the [[Three Mile Island accident]] and [[Chernobyl disaster]], relatively few municipalities welcome a new nuclear reactor, processing plant, transportation route, or [[deep geological repository]] within their borders, and some have issued local ordinances prohibiting the locating of such facilities there.

[[Nancy Folbre]], an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, has questioned the economic viability of nuclear power following the [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The proven dangers of nuclear power amplify the economic risks of expanding reliance on it. Indeed, the stronger regulation and improved safety features for nuclear reactors called for in the wake of the Japanese disaster will almost certainly require costly provisions that may price it out of the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/renewing-support-for-renewables/ |title=Renewing Support for Renewables |author=Nancy Folbre |date=March 28, 2011  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cascade of problems at Fukushima, from one reactor to another, and from reactors to fuel storage pools, will affect the design, layout and ultimately the cost of future nuclear plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12960655 |title=Viewpoint: Fukushima makes case for renewable energy |author=Antony Froggatt |date=4 April 2011 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Pete Planchon conducted a demonstration of the inherent safety of the [[Integral Fast Reactor]].  Safety interlocks were turned off.  Coolant circulation was turned off.  Core temperature rose from the usual 1000 degrees Fahrenheit to 1430 degrees within 20 seconds.  The boiling temperature of the sodium coolant is 1621 degrees.  Within seven minutes the reactor had shut itself down without action from the operators, without valves, pumps, computers, auxiliary power, or any moving parts.  The temperature was below the operating temperature.  The reactor was not damaged.  The operators were not injured.  There was no release of radioactive material.  The reactor was restarted with coolant circulation but the steam generator disconnected.  The same scenario recurred.  Three weeks later, the operators at Chernobyl repeated the latter experiment, ironically in a rush to complete a safety test, using a very different reactor, with tragic consequences. Safety of the Integral Fast Reactor depends on the composition and geometry of the core, not efforts by operators or computer algorithms.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

=== Insurance ===
Insurance available to the operators of nuclear power plants varies by nation. The [[List of disasters by cost|worst case nuclear accident costs]] are so large that it would be difficult for the private insurance industry to carry the size of the risk, and the premium cost of full insurance would make nuclear energy uneconomic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=13428045 |title=Nuclear Dilemma: Adequate Insurance Too Expensive |author=Juergen Baetz |agency=Associated Press |date=21 April 2011 |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power has largely worked under an insurance framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with the [[Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy|Paris convention on nuclear third-party liability]], the Brussels supplementary convention, the [[Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage|Vienna convention on civil liability for nuclear damage]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Conventions/liability.html Publications: Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage]. [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States the [[Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act|Price-Anderson Act]]. It is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity.

However, the problem of insurance costs for worst-case scenarios is not unique to nuclear power: [[hydroelectric power]] plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the [[Banqiao Dam]] disaster, where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died, or large [[dam failure]]s in general.&lt;ref name="damsafety.org" /&gt; Private insurers base dam insurance premiums on worst-case scenarios, so insurance for major disasters in this sector is likewise provided by the state.&lt;ref name="damsafety.org" /&gt;

In Canada, the Canadian Nuclear Liability Act requires nuclear power plant operators to obtain $650 million (CAD) of liability insurance coverage per installation (regardless of the number of individual reactors present) starting in 2017 (up from the prior $75 million requirement established in 1976), increasing to $750 million in 2018, to $850 million in 2019, and finally to $1 billion in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branch|first1=Legislative Services|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act|url=http://www.laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.1/FullText.html|website=www.laws.justice.gc.ca|accessdate=12 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branch|first1=Legislative Services|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Nuclear Liability Act|url=http://www.laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28/20021231/P1TT3xt3.html|website=www.laws.justice.gc.ca|accessdate=12 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims beyond the insured amount would be assessed by a government appointed but independent tribunal, and paid by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cna.ca/english/pdf/nuclearfacts/19-NuclearFacts-insurance.pdf |title=Canadian Nuclear Association |publisher=Cna.ca |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2015-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312123030/http://www.cna.ca/english/pdf/nuclearfacts/19-NuclearFacts-insurance.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[Nuclear Installations Act 1965]] governs liability for nuclear damage for which a UK nuclear licensee is responsible. The limit for the operator is £140&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf67.html|title=Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage – Nuclear Insurance|work=world-nuclear.org|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Price-Anderson Act]] has governed the insurance of the nuclear power industry since 1957. Owners of nuclear power plants are required to pay a premium each year for the maximum obtainable amount of private insurance ($450 million) for each licensed reactor unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Increase in the Maximum Amount of Primary Nuclear Liability Insurance|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/30/2016-31368/increase-in-the-maximum-amount-of-primary-nuclear-liability-insurance|website=Federal Register|accessdate=12 February 2017|date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This primary or "first tier" insurance is supplemented by a second tier. In the event a nuclear accident incurs damages in excess of $450 million, each licensee would be assessed a prorated share of the excess up to $121,255,000. With 104 reactors currently licensed to operate, this secondary tier of funds contains about $12.61 billion. This results in a maximum combined primary+secondary coverage amount of up to $13.06 billion for a hypothetical single-reactor incident. If 15 percent of these funds are expended, prioritization of the remaining amount would be left to a federal district court. If the second tier is depleted, Congress is committed to determine whether additional disaster relief is required.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/funds-fs.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702164759/http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/funds-fs.html|date=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] extended the Price-Anderson Act to newer facilities.

The [[Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage]] and the [[Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy]] put in place two similar international frameworks for nuclear liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Conventions/liability.html|title=Publications: International Conventions and Legal Agreements|work=iaea.org|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limits for the conventions vary. The Vienna convention was adapted in 2004 to increase the operator liability to €700&amp;nbsp;million per incident, but this modification is not yet ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.fr/html/general/press/2004/2004-01.html|title=Press Communiqué 6 June 2003 – Revised Nuclear Third Party Liability Conventions Improve Victims' Rights to Compensation|work=nea.fr|accessdate=1 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622183825/http://www.nea.fr/html/general/press/2004/2004-01.html|archive-date=2007-06-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost per kWh ==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=August 2012}}
The cost per unit of electricity produced (kWh) will vary according to country, depending on costs in the area, the regulatory regime and consequent financial and other risks, and the availability and cost of finance. Costs will also depend on geographic factors such as availability of cooling water, earthquake likelihood, and availability of suitable power grid connections. So it is not possible to accurately estimate costs on a global basis.

Commodity prices rose in 2008, and so all types of plants became more expensive than previously calculated.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Costs Explode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmia.com/News/FLNuclearCostsExplode.htm|title=(Florida) Nuclear Costs Explode|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=September 7, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509172053/http://www.tmia.com/News/FLNuclearCostsExplode.htm|archivedate=May 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2008 Moody's estimated that the cost of installing new nuclear capacity in the United States might possibly exceed $7,000/[[MWe|KW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;]] in final cost.&lt;ref&gt;[[Platts]]: [http://www.tuumaenergia.ee/index.php?id=65&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bcat%5D=2&amp;tx_ttnews%5BpS%5D=1199138400&amp;tx_ttnews%5BpL%5D=31622399&amp;tx_ttnews%5Barc%5D=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=541&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=64&amp;cHash=d282a7a691 A utility's credit quality could be negatively impacted by building a new nuclear power plant], 2 June 2008, [[Moody's Investors Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;
In comparison, the reactor units already under construction in China have been reported with substantially lower costs due to significantly lower labour rates.

A 2008 study by former utility staffperson Craig A. Severance based on historical outcomes in the United States said costs for nuclear power can be expected to run $0.25–0.30 per kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climateprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/nuclear-costs-2009.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225154550/http://climateprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/nuclear-costs-2009.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |format=PDF |title=Business Risks and Costs of New Nuclear Power |author=Craig A.

A 2008 study concluded that if carbon capture and storage were required then nuclear power would be the cheapest source of electricity even at $4,038/kW in overnight capital cost.&lt;ref name="wna-teonp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf02.html |title=The Economics of Nuclear Power |accessdate=2009-04-01 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |year=2009 |work=Information and Issue Briefs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, MIT updated its 2003 study, concluding that inflation and rising construction costs had increased the overnight cost of nuclear power plants to about $4,000/kW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus increased the power cost to $0.084/kWh.&lt;ref name="MIT-2009-update-detail"&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://web.mit.edu/ceepr/www/publications/workingpapers/2009-004.pdf | title= Update on the Cost of Nuclear Power | author= Yangbo Du |author2=John E.

According to [[Benjamin K.

In 2014, the US [[Energy Information Administration]] estimated the levelized cost of electricity from new nuclear power plants going online in 2019 to be $0.096/kWh before government subsidies, comparable to the cost of electricity from a new coal-fired power plant without carbon capture, but higher than the cost from natural gas-fired plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf |format=PDF |title=Levelized Cost and Levelized Avoided Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2015 |publisher=Eia.gov |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparisons with other power sources ===
[[File:Nuke, coal, gas generating costs.png|thumb]]
{{See also|Cost of electricity by source}}

Generally, a nuclear power plant is significantly more expensive to build than an equivalent coal-fueled or gas-fueled plant. If natural gas is plentiful and cheap operating costs of conventional power plants is less.&lt;ref name=NYT122214&gt;{{cite news|author1=Henry Fountain|title=Nuclear: Carbon Free, but Not Free of Unease|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/23/science/nuclear-carbon-free-but-not-free-of-unease-.html |accessdate=December 23, 2014|work=The New York Times|publisher=The Times Company|date=December 22, 2014|quote=the plant had become unprofitable in recent years, a victim largely of lower energy prices resulting from a glut of natural gas used to fire electricity plants}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most forms of electricity generation produce some form of [[externality|negative externality]] — costs imposed on third parties that are not directly paid by the producer — such as [[pollution]] which negatively affects the health of those near and downwind of the power plant, and generation costs often do not reflect these external costs.

A comparison of the "real" cost of various energy sources is complicated by a number of uncertainties:
*The cost of climate change through emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es is hard to estimate.  [[Carbon tax]]es may be enacted, or [[carbon capture and storage]] may become mandatory.
*The cost of environmental damage caused by any energy source through land use (whether for mining fuels or for power generation), air and water pollution, solid waste production, manufacturing-related damages (such as from mining and processing ores or rare earth elements), etc.
*The cost and political feasibility of disposal of the waste from [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]] [[spent nuclear fuel]] is still not fully resolved.  In the United States, the ultimate disposal costs of spent nuclear fuel are assumed by the U.S. government after producers pay a fixed surcharge.
*[[Operating reserve]] requirements are different for different generation methods. When nuclear units shut down unexpectedly they tend to do so independently, so the "hot spinning reserve" must be at least the size of the largest unit. On the other hand, some renewable energy sources (such as solar/wind power) are [[intermittent power source]]s with uncontrollably varying outputs, so the grid will require a combination of large-scale fast-ramping backup generation capacity, extensive transmission infrastructure, and/or large-scale energy storage if [[Intermittent energy source#Penetration|the portion of generation from these intermittent renewable energy sources is significant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://reneweconomy.com.au/german-grid-operator-sees-70-wind-solar-storage-needed-35731/ |title=German grid operator sees 70% wind + solar before storage needed|work=Renew Economy |date=7 December 2015 |accessdate=20 January 2017 |quote=Schucht says, in the region he is operating in, 42 per cent of the power supply (in output, not capacity), came from wind and solar – about the same as South Australia. Schucht believes that integration of 60 to 70 per cent variable renewable energy – just wind and solar – could be accommodated within the German market without the need for additional storage. Beyond that, storage will be needed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Some firm renewables such as [[hydroelectricity]] have a storage reservoir and can be used as reliable back-up power for other power sources.)
*Potential governmental instabilities in the plant's lifetime. [[Generation III reactor|Modern nuclear reactors]] are designed for a minimum operational lifetime of 60 years (extendible to 100+ years), compared to the 40 years (extendible to 60+ years) that older reactors were designed for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New material promises 120-year reactor lives|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-New-material-promises-120-year-reactor-lives-2107151.html|website=www.world-nuclear-news.org|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Actual plant lifetime (to date, no nuclear plant has been shut down solely due to reaching its licensed lifetime.

*Due to the dominant role of initial construction costs and the multi-year construction time, the interest rate for the capital required (as well as the timeline that the plant is completed in) has a major impact on the total cost of building a new nuclear plant.

A UK Royal Academy of Engineering report in 2004 looked at electricity generation costs from new plants in the UK. In particular it aimed to develop "a robust approach to compare directly the costs of intermittent generation with more dependable sources of generation". This meant adding the cost of standby capacity for wind, as well as carbon values up to £30 (€45.44) per tonne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;!--(£110/tC)--&gt; for coal and gas. Wind power was calculated to be more than twice as expensive as nuclear power. Without a carbon tax, the cost of production through coal, nuclear and gas ranged £0.022–0.026/[[kWh]] and coal gasification was £0.032/kWh. When carbon tax was added (up to £0.025) coal came close to onshore wind (including back-up power) at £0.054/kWh — offshore wind is £0.072/kWh — nuclear power remained at £0.023/kWh either way, as it produces negligible amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. (Nuclear figures included estimated decommissioning costs.)&lt;ref name="MIT-2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wna-teonp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="countryguardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countryguardian.net/generation_costs_report2.pdf |title=The Costs of Generating Electricity |accessdate=2006-11-10 |publisher=The Royal Academy of Engineering |year=2004 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008174530/http://www.countryguardian.net/generation_costs_report2.pdf |archive-date=2007-10-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A May 2008 study by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] concludes that a carbon tax of $45 per tonne of carbon dioxide would probably make nuclear power cost competitive against conventional fossil fuel for electricity generation.&lt;ref name="CBO-200805"&gt;{{Cite journal|url= http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/91xx/doc9133/05-02-Nuclear.pdf |title=Nuclear Power's Role in Generating Electricity|date=May 2008|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=2009-08-03 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of total lifetime energy returned on energy invested vary greatly depending on the study. An overview can be found here (Table 2):&lt;ref name="wna-eaops"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf11.html |title=Energy Analysis of Power Systems |accessdate=2006-11-10 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |year=2006 |work=Information and Issue Briefs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of subsidies is difficult to gauge, as some are indirect (such as research and development).  A May&amp;nbsp;12, 2008 editorial in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' stated, "For electricity generation, the EIA ([[Energy Information Administration]], an office of the Department of Energy) concludes that solar energy is subsidized to the tune of $24.34 per megawatt hour, wind $23.37 and 'clean coal' $29.81. By contrast, normal coal receives 44&amp;nbsp;cents, natural gas a mere quarter, hydroelectric about 67&amp;nbsp;cents and nuclear power $1.59."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121055427930584069?mod=opinion_main_review_and_outlooks Wind ($23.37) v. Gas (25 Cents)], ''The Wall Street Journal'', May 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Lazard's report on the estimated levelized cost of energy by source (10th edition) estimated unsubsidized prices of $97–$136/MWh for nuclear, $50–$60/MWh for solar PV, $32–$62/MWh for onshore wind, and $82–$155/MWh for offshore wind.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lazard.com/media/438038/levelized-cost-of-energy-v100.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, their report did not take into account any of the significant integration costs associated with variable renewable resources, assumed an unrealistically short facility lifetime of just 40 years for the nuclear plant, and used global illustrative costs of capital instead of the significantly lower OECD or North American costs of capital.

However, the most important subsidies to the nuclear industry do not involve cash payments. Rather, they shift construction costs and operating risks from investors to taxpayers and ratepayers, burdening them with an array of risks including cost overruns, defaults to accidents, and nuclear waste management. This approach has remained remarkably consistent throughout the nuclear industry's history, and distorts market choices that would otherwise favor less risky energy investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear_subsidies_report.pdf |title=Nuclear Power:Still Not Viable without Subsidies |author=Koplow, Doug |date=February 2011 |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] said that: "When the full nuclear fuel cycle is considered — not only reactors but also uranium mines and mills, enrichment facilities, spent fuel repositories, and decommissioning sites — nuclear power proves to be one of the costliest sources of energy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spp.nus.edu.sg/docs/policy-briefs/201101_RSU_PolicyBrief_1-2nd_Thought_Nuclear-Sovacool.pdf |title=Second Thoughts About Nuclear Power |author=Benjamin K.

In 2014, [[Brookings Institution]] published ''The Net Benefits of Low and No-Carbon Electricity Technologies'' which states, after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis, that "The net benefits of new nuclear, hydro, and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants", with the most cost effective [[low carbon power]] technology being determined to be nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21608646-wind-and-solar-power-are-even-more-expensive-commonly-thought-sun-wind-and |title=Sun, wind and drain|work=The Economist|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2014/05/19%20low%20carbon%20future%20wind%20solar%20power%20frank/net%20benefits%20final.pdf |format=PDF |title=THE NET BENEFITS OF LOW AND NO-CARBON ELECTRICITY TECHNOLOGIES |date=May 2014 |author=Charles Frank |publisher=Brookings.edu |accessdate=2015-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150814175841/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2014/05/19%20low%20carbon%20future%20wind%20solar%20power%20frank/net%20benefits%20final.pdf |archivedate=2015-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Paul Joskow of MIT has determined that the "[[Levelized cost of electricity]]" (LCOE) metric is a poor means of comparing electricity sources as it hides the extra costs, such as the need to frequently operate back up power stations, incurred due to the use of [[intermittent]] power sources such as wind energy, while the value of [[baseload]] power sources are underpresented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/6317 |title= Comparing the Costs of Intermittent and Dispatchable Electricity-Generating Technologies|author=Paul Joskow|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=September 2011|accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An EU-funded research study known as ExternE, or Externalities of Energy, undertaken from 1995 to 2005, found that the cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double, and the cost of electricity production from gas would increase by 30% if external costs such as damage to the environment and to human health, from the [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], [[nitrogen oxides]], [[chromium VI]], river water [[Alkali soils|alkalinity]], [[mercury poisoning]] and [[arsenic]] emissions produced by these sources, were taken into account. It was estimated in the study that these external, downstream, fossil fuel costs amount up to 1–2% of the [[Economy of the European Union|EU's Gross Domestic Product]], and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ier.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/projektwebsites/newext/externen.pdf |format=PDF |title=New research reveals the real costs of electricity in Europe |publisher=Ier.uni-stuttgart.de |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that the environmental and health costs of nuclear power, per unit of energy delivered, was lower than many [[renewable]] sources, including that caused by [[biomass]] and photovoltaic [[solar panels]], but was higher than the external costs associated with [[wind power]] and alpine [[hydropower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.externe.info/externe_2006/exterpols.html |title=ExternE-Pol Final Reports|work=externe.info |accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other economic issues ==
[[Kristin Shrader-Frechette]] analysed 30 papers on the economics of nuclear power for possible conflicts of interest. She found of the 30, 18 had been funded either by the nuclear industry or pro-nuclear governments and were pro-nuclear, 11 were funded by universities or non-profit [[non-government organisations]] and were anti-nuclear, the remaining 1 had unknown sponsors and took the pro-nuclear stance. The pro-nuclear studies were accused of using cost-trimming methods such as ignoring government subsidies and using industry projections above empirical evidence where ever possible. The situation was compared to medical research where 98% of industry sponsored studies return positive results.&lt;ref name=pmid19898994&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11948-009-9181-y |pmid=19898994 |title=Climate Change, Nuclear Economics, and Conflicts of Interest |journal=Science and Engineering Ethics |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=75–107 |year=2009 |last1=Shrader-Frechette |first1=Kristin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Council on Foreign Relations]] report on nuclear energy argues that a rapid expansion of nuclear power may create shortages in building materials such as reactor-quality concrete and steel, skilled workers and engineers, and safety controls by skilled inspectors. This would drive up current prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/NuclearEnergyCSR28.pdf | title= Nuclear Energy: Balancing Benefits and Risks |author= Charles D.

Existing nuclear plants generally have a somewhat limited ability to significantly vary their output in order to match changing demand (a practice called [[Load following power plant|load following]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrews |first=Dave |url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/nuclear-power-stations-cant-load-follow-that-much-official.html |title="Nuclear power stations can't load follow that much" – Official &amp;#124; Claverton Group |publisher=Claverton-energy.com |date=2009-04-29 |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many [[boiling water reactor|BWRs]], some [[pressurized water reactor|PWRs]] (mainly [[Nuclear power in France|in France]]), and certain [[CANDU]] reactors (primarily those at [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]]) have various levels of load-following capabilities (sometimes substantial), which allow them to fill more than just baseline generation needs. Several newer reactor designs also offer some form of enhanced load-following capability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessa.eu.com/sd_papers/wp/wp2/0203_Pouret_Nuttall.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225154550/http://www.cessa.eu.com/sd_papers/wp/wp2/0203_Pouret_Nuttall.pdf|date=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the Areva EPR can slew its electrical output power between 990 and 1,650 MW at 82.5 MW per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://areva.com/EN/global-offer-419/mediashare-1070/video/page.html?xtor=AD-71 |title=EPR™ reactor, one of the most powerful in the world |publisher=AREVA |date= |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of companies that manufacture certain parts for nuclear reactors is limited, particularly the large forgings used for reactor vessels and steam systems.

The large forgings for steam generators — although still very heavy — can be produced by a far larger number of suppliers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7381">Records of archaeological excavations at the Stonehenge site date back to the early 17th century.

==Early research==
The first known excavations at Stonehenge were undertaken by Dr [[William Harvey]] and Gilbert North in the early 17th century. Both [[Inigo Jones]] and the Duke of Buckingham also dug there shortly afterwards. In 1666 the antiquarian [[John Aubrey]] could still see the central sunken hollow where the Duke of Buckingham’s pit had been filled.&lt;ref&gt;Aubrey, John, ''Monumenta Britannica''. (Published by Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1980 (John Fowles ed.))&lt;/ref&gt; A few minor investigations followed.

Further excavations at Stonehenge were carried out by [[William Cunnington]] and [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. In 1798, Cunnington investigated the pit beneath a recently fallen trilithon, and in 1810 both men dug beneath the fallen Slaughter Stone and concluded that it had once stood up. They may have also excavated one of the Aubrey Holes beneath it. In 1839, a Captain Beamish dug around the Altar Stone, and not long after that [[Charles Darwin]] was granted permission by the Antrobus family who owned Stonehenge to conduct a small excavation to test his theories about [[earthworm]] activity burying ancient structures.

==Modern studies==
On New Year's Eve 1900, Stone 22 of the Sarsen Circle fell over, taking with it a lintel. Following public pressure and a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' by [[William Flinders Petrie]], the then owner of Stonehenge, Edmund Antrobus, agreed to some remedial engineering work to be undertaken with archaeological supervision so that records could be made of the below ground archaeology. Antrobus appointed a mining engineer named [[William Gowland]] to manage the work. Despite having no archaeological training, Gowland produced some of the finest, most detailed excavation records ever made at the monument. Gowland established that antler picks were used to dig the stone holes and suggested the stones themselves were worked to shape on site.

[[File:Heelstone Ditch &amp; Scroll Trench.jpg|thumb|Excavations near the [[Heel Stone]] (''The Antiquaries Journal'', 1925)]]

The largest series of excavations at Stonehenge were undertaken by Colonel [[William Hawley]] and his assistant Robert Newall after the site came into state hands. Stonehenge and {{convert|30|acre|m2}} of land was purchased by Mr. Cecil Chubb for £6,600 on September 21, 1915 for his wife &amp;mdash; she donated the land to the British government three years later. Their work began in 1919 following the transfer of land, funded by the [[Office of Works]], and continued until 1926. Hawley and Newall excavated portions of most of the features at Stonehenge and were the first to establish that it was a multi-phase site.

In 1950 the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] commissioned [[Richard J. C. Atkinson]], [[Stuart Piggott]] and [[John FS Stone]] to carry out further excavations. They recovered many cremations and developed the phrasing that still dominates much of what is written about Stonehenge.

As part of service trenching in 1979 and 1980, Mike Pitts led two smaller investigations close by the Heelstone, finding the evidence for its neighbour. More recent excavations have been held to mitigate the effects of electrical cables, sewage pipes, and a footpath through the site.

Since 2003, Mike Parker Pearson has led investigations in the stones area as part of the [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]] in an attempt to better relate Stonehenge to its surrounding environs. National Geographic Channel screened a [https://web.archive.org/web/20081119153004/http://www.natgeotv.com/stonehenge two-hour documentary] exploring Parker Pearson's theories and the work of the Riverside Project in depth in May 2008. In April 2008 Professor Tim Darvill of the [[University of Bournemouth]] and Professor [[Geoffrey Wainwright (archaeologist)|Geoff Wainwright]] of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] excavated a small area inside the stone circle It is hoped this will establish a more precise date for the earliest stone structure that occupied the Q and R Holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

From 2005 excavation of the area around a spring pool known as [[Blick Mead]] about a mile from Stonehenge, have taken place under the direction of Professor David Jacques of the [[University of Buckingham]].

Britain's [[Bournemouth University]] [[archaeologists]], led by Geoffrey Wainwright, president of the [[London]] [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]], and Timothy Darvill, on September 22, 2008, found it may have been an ancient healing and pilgrimage site, since burials around Stonehenge showed trauma and deformity evidence: "It was the magical qualities of these stones which ... transformed the monument and made it a place of pilgrimage for the sick and injured of the [[Neolithic]] world." [[Radio-carbon dating]] places the construction of the circle of [[bluestones]] at between 2,400 B.C. and 2,200 B.C., but they discovered charcoals dating 7,000 B.C., showing human activity in the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUKTRE48M0R320080923 uk.reuters.com, Stonehenge may have been pilgrimage site for sick]&lt;/ref&gt; It could be a primeval equivalent of [[Lourdes]], since the area was already visited 4,000 years before the oldest [[stone circle]], and attracted visitors for centuries after its abandonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph.news.yahoo.com/ap/20080923/twl-eu-britain-stonehenge-c8e2916.html news.yahoo.com, UK experts say Stonehenge was place of healing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/sep/23/archaeology.heritage  guardian.co.uk, The magic of Stonehenge: new dig finds clues to power of bluestones]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MagnetEZ.jpg|thumb|A [[magnet]] made of [[alnico]], an iron alloy, with its [[Magnet keeper|keeper]].]]
'''Ferromagnetism''' is the basic mechanism by which certain materials (such as [[iron]]) form [[permanent magnet]]s, or are attracted to [[magnet]]s. In [[physics]], several different types of [[magnetism]] are distinguished. Ferromagnetism (along with the similar effect [[ferrimagnetism]])  is the strongest type and is responsible for the common phenomena of magnetism in [[Magnet#Common uses|magnets encountered in everyday life]].&lt;ref name=Chikazumi&gt;{{cite book|last=Chikazumi|first=Sōshin|title=Physics of ferromagnetism|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199564811|edition=2nd |others= English edition prepared with the assistance of C.D. Graham, Jr |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substances respond weakly to magnetic fields with three other types of magnetism, [[paramagnetism]], [[diamagnetism]], and [[antiferromagnetism]], but the forces are usually so weak that they can only be detected by sensitive instruments in a laboratory.  An everyday example of ferromagnetism is a [[refrigerator magnet]] used to hold notes on a refrigerator door.  The attraction between a magnet and ferromagnetic material is "the quality of magnetism first apparent to the ancient world, and to us today".&lt;ref name="bozorth"&gt;Bozorth, Richard M. ''Ferromagnetism'', first published 1951, reprinted 1993 by [[IEEE]] Press, New York as a "Classic Reissue." {{ISBN|0-7803-1032-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent magnets (materials that can be [[Magnetization|magnetized]] by an external [[magnetic field]] and remain magnetized after the external field is removed) are either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic, as are the materials that are noticeably attracted to them.  Only a few substances are ferromagnetic.  The common ones are [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]] and most of their alloys, and some compounds of [[Rare-earth magnet|rare earth metals]].
Ferromagnetism is very important in industry and modern technology, and is the basis for many electrical and electromechanical devices such as [[electromagnet]]s, [[electric motor]]s, [[Electric generator|generators]], [[transformer]]s, and [[magnetic storage]] such as [[tape recorder]]s, and [[hard disk]]s, and [[nondestructive testing]] of ferrous materials.

==History and distinction from ferrimagnetism==
[[File:Ferromagnetic ordering.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Ferromagnetic ordering in the strict sense]]
[[File:Ferrimagnetic ordering.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Ferrimagnetic ordering]]
Historically, the term ''ferromagnetism'' was used for any material that could exhibit spontaneous magnetization: a net magnetic moment in the absence of an external magnetic field. This general definition is still in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Somasundaran|editor-first1=P.|title=Encyclopedia of surface and colloid science|date=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=New York|isbn=9780849396083|pages=3471|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a landmark paper in 1948, [[Louis Néel]] showed there are two levels of magnetic alignment that result in this behavior. One is ferromagnetism in the strict sense, where all the magnetic moments are aligned. The other is ''[[ferrimagnetism]]'', where some magnetic moments point in the opposite direction but have a smaller contribution, so there is still a spontaneous magnetization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cullity |first1=B.D. |last2=Graham |first2=C.D. |chapter=6. Ferrimagnetism |title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781118211496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aharoni |first1=Amikam |title=Introduction to the theory of ferromagnetism |date=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780198508090 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28–29}}

In the special case where the opposing moments balance completely, the alignment is known as ''[[antiferromagnetism]]''; but antiferromagnets do not have a spontaneous magnetization.

The table above lists a selection of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic compounds, along with the temperature above which they cease to exhibit spontaneous magnetization (see [[Curie temperature]]).

Ferromagnetism is a property not just of the chemical make-up of a material, but of its crystalline structure and microstructure. There are ferromagnetic metal alloys whose constituents are not themselves ferromagnetic, called [[Heusler alloy]]s, named after [[Fritz Heusler]]. Conversely there are non-magnetic alloys, such as types of [[stainless steel]], composed almost exclusively of ferromagnetic metals.

Amorphous (non-crystalline) ferromagnetic metallic alloys can be made by very rapid [[quenching]] (cooling) of a liquid alloy. These have the advantage that their properties are nearly isotropic (not aligned along a crystal axis); this results in low [[coercivity]], low [[hysteresis]] loss, high permeability, and high electrical resistivity. One such typical material is a transition metal-metalloid alloy, made from about 80% transition metal (usually Fe, Co, or Ni) and a metalloid component ([[Boron|B]], [[Carbon|C]], [[Silicon|Si]], [[Phosphorus|P]], or [[Aluminium|Al]]) that lowers the melting point.
&lt;!--changes here are not correct; commenting out until sorted out on talk: One example of such an amorphous alloy is Fe&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; (Metglas 2605) which has a Curie temperature of 647&amp;nbsp;K and a room-temperature (300&amp;nbsp;K) saturation magnetization of 1.58&amp;nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|teslas]] (1,257&amp;nbsp;[[gauss]]), compared with 1,043&amp;nbsp;K and 2.15&amp;nbsp;T (1,707&amp;nbsp;gauss) for pure iron from above. The melting point, or more precisely the glass transition temperature, is only 714&amp;nbsp;K for the alloy versus a melting point of 1,811&amp;nbsp;K for pure iron.--&gt;

A relatively new class of exceptionally strong ferromagnetic materials are the [[rare-earth magnet]]s. They contain [[lanthanide]] elements that are known for their ability to carry large magnetic moments in well-localized f-orbitals.

===Actinide ferromagnets===
A number of [[actinide]] compounds are ferromagnets at room temperature or exhibit ferromagnetism upon cooling. [[Plutonium|Pu]][[Phosphorus|P]] is a paramagnet with [[Cubic crystal system|cubic symmetry]] at [[room temperature]], but which undergoes a structural transition into a [[Tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]] state with ferromagnetic order when cooled below its T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;125&amp;nbsp;K. In its ferromagnetic state, PuP's [[easy axis]] is in the &lt;100&gt; direction.&lt;ref name=Lander&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lander GH, Lam DJ |title=Neutron diffraction study of PuP: The electronic ground state |journal=Phys.

Cooling below the Curie temperature produces a rhombohedral distortion wherein the rhombohedral angle changes from 60° (cubic phase) to 60.53°. An alternate description of this distortion is to consider the length ''c'' along the unique trigonal axis (after the distortion has begun) and ''a'' as the distance in the plane perpendicular to ''c''. In the cubic phase this reduces to {{nowrap|''{{sfrac|c|a}}'' {{=}} 1.00}}. Below the [[Curie temperature]]

===Lithium gas===
In 2009, a team of [[MIT]] physicists demonstrated that a lithium gas cooled to less than one kelvin can exhibit ferromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=G-B Jo |author2=Y-R Lee |author3=J-H Choi |author4=C.A.

This demonstration is the first time that ferromagnetism has been demonstrated in a gas.

===Tetragonal ruthenium===
In 2018, a team of [[University of Minnesota]] physicists demonstrated that body-centered tetragonal [[ruthenium]] exhibits ferromagnetism at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Quarterman, P. |author2=Sun, Congli |author3=Garcia-Barriocanal, Javier |author4=DC, Mahendra |author5=Lv, Yang |author6=Manipatruni, Sasikanth |author7=Nikonov, Dmitri E. |author8=Young, Ian A. |author9=Voyles, Paul M. |author10=Wang, Jian-Ping |title=Demonstration of Ru as the 4th ferromagnetic element at room temperature |journal= Nature Communications |year=2018 |volume=9 |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-04512-1 |url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04512-1 |bibcode=2018NatCo...9.2058Q }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
The [[Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem]], discovered in the 1910s, showed that [[classical physics]] theories are unable to account for any form of magnetism, including ferromagnetism. Magnetism is now regarded as a purely [[quantum mechanical]] effect. Ferromagnetism arises due to two effects from quantum mechanics: [[spin (physics)|spin]] and the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Feynman|first = Richard P.|author2=Robert Leighton |author3=Matthew Sands|title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 2|publisher = Addison-Wesley|year = 1963 |location = |pages = Ch. 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of magnetism===
One of the fundamental properties of an [[electron]] (besides that it carries charge) is that it has a [[Electron magnetic moment|magnetic dipole moment]], i.e., it behaves like a tiny magnet, producing a [[magnetic field]]. This dipole moment comes from the more fundamental property of the electron that it has quantum mechanical [[Spin (physics)|spin]].  Due to its quantum nature, the spin of the electron can be in one of only two states; with the magnetic field either pointing "up" or "down" (for any choice of up and down). The spin of the electrons in atoms is the main source of ferromagnetism, although there is also a contribution from the [[Atomic orbital|orbital]] [[angular momentum]] of the electron about the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. When these magnetic dipoles in a piece of matter are aligned, (point in the same direction) their individually tiny magnetic fields add together to create a much larger macroscopic field.

However, materials made of atoms with filled [[electron shell]]s have a total dipole moment of zero, because the electrons all exist in pairs with opposite spin, every electron's magnetic moment is cancelled by the opposite moment of the second electron in the pair. Only atoms with partially filled shells (i.e., [[Unpaired electron|unpaired spins]]) can have a net magnetic moment, so ferromagnetism only occurs in materials with partially filled shells. Because of [[Hund's rules]], the first few electrons in a shell tend to have the same spin, thereby increasing the total dipole moment.

These [[unpaired electron|unpaired dipoles]] (often called simply "spins" even though they also generally include orbital angular momentum) tend to align in parallel to an external magnetic field, an effect called [[paramagnetism]]. Ferromagnetism involves an additional phenomenon, however: in a few substances the dipoles tend to align spontaneously, giving rise to a [[spontaneous magnetization]], even when there is no applied field.

===Exchange interaction===
{{Main|Exchange interaction}}
When two nearby atoms have unpaired electrons, whether the electron spins are parallel or antiparallel affects whether the electrons can share the same orbit as a result of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effect called the [[exchange interaction]]. This in turn affects the electron location and the [[Coulomb force|Coulomb (electrostatic) interaction]] and thus the energy difference between these states.

The exchange interaction is related to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which says that two electrons with the same spin cannot also be in the same spatial state (orbital). This is a consequence of the [[spin-statistics theorem]] and that electrons are [[fermions]]. Therefore, under certain conditions, when the [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the unpaired outer [[valence electron]]s from adjacent atoms overlap, the distributions of their electric charge in space are farther apart when the electrons have parallel spins than when they have opposite spins. This reduces the [[electrostatic energy]] of the electrons when their spins are parallel compared to their energy when the spins are anti-parallel, so the parallel-spin state is more stable.  In simple terms, the electrons, which repel one another, can move "further apart" by aligning their spins, so the spins of these electrons tend to line up.  This difference in energy is called the [[exchange energy]].

This energy difference can be orders of magnitude larger than the energy differences associated with the [[magnetic dipole-dipole interaction]] due to dipole orientation,&lt;ref name=Chikazumi2&gt;{{cite book|last=Chikazumi|first=Sōshin|title=Physics of ferromagnetism|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199564811|edition=2nd |others= English edition prepared with the assistance of C.D. Graham, Jr |pages=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tends to align the dipoles antiparallel.   In certain doped semiconductor oxides [[RKKY interaction]]s have been shown to bring about periodic longer-range magnetic interactions, a phenomenon of significance in the study of [[Spintronics|spintronic materials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Assadi| first1=M.H.N| last2=Hanaor| first2=D.A.H| title= Theoretical study on copper's energetics and magnetism in TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; polymorphs| journal= Journal of Applied Physics| year=2013| volume=113| issue=23| pages= 233913| url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1304/1304.1854.pdf| doi=10.1063/1.4811539|arxiv = 1304.1854 |bibcode = 2013JAP...113w3913A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The materials in which the exchange interaction is much stronger than the competing dipole-dipole interaction are frequently called ''magnetic materials''. For instance, in iron (Fe) the exchange force is about 1000 times stronger than the dipole interaction.  Therefore, below the Curie temperature virtually all of the dipoles in a ferromagnetic material will be aligned. In addition to ferromagnetism, the exchange interaction is also responsible for the other types of spontaneous ordering of atomic magnetic moments occurring in magnetic solids, [[antiferromagnetism]] and [[ferrimagnetism]].
There are different exchange interaction mechanisms which create the magnetism in different ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic substances.  These mechanisms include [[Exchange interaction#Direct exchange interactions in solids|direct exchange]], [[RKKY interaction|RKKY exchange]], [[double exchange]], and [[superexchange]].

===Magnetic anisotropy===
{{Main|Magnetic anisotropy}}

Although the exchange interaction keeps spins aligned, it does not align them in a particular direction. Without [[magnetic anisotropy]], the spins in a magnet randomly change direction in response to [[thermal fluctuations]] and the magnet is [[superparamagnetic]]. There are several kinds of magnetic anisotropy, the most common of which is [[magnetocrystalline anisotropy]]. This is a dependence of the energy on the direction of magnetization relative to the [[crystallographic lattice]]. Another common source of anisotropy, [[inverse magnetostriction]], is induced by internal [[deformation (mechanics)|strains]]. [[Single-domain (magnetic)|Single-domain magnets]] also can have a ''shape anisotropy'' due to the magnetostatic effects of the particle shape. As the temperature of a magnet increases, the anisotropy tends to decrease, and there is often a [[superparamagnetism#Blocking temperature|blocking temperature]] at which a transition to superparamagnetism occurs.&lt;ref name=Aharoni&gt;{{cite book|last=Aharoni|first=Amikam|author-link=Amikam Aharoni|title=Introduction to the Theory of Ferromagnetism|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|year=1996|isbn=0-19-851791-2|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Physics/ElectricityMagnetism/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198508090|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629022541/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Physics/ElectricityMagnetism/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198508090|archivedate=2011-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic domains===
[[File:Electromagnetic dynamic magnetic domain motion of grain oriented electrical silicon steel.gif|thumb|Electromagnetic dynamic magnetic domain motion of grain oriented electrical silicon steel.]]
[[File:Weiss-Bezirke1.png|thumb|Kerr micrograph of metal surface showing magnetic domains, with red and green stripes denoting opposite magnetization directions.]]
{{Main|Magnetic domain}}

The above would seem to suggest that every piece of ferromagnetic material should have a strong magnetic field, since all the spins are aligned, yet iron and other ferromagnets are often found in an "unmagnetized" state.  The reason for this is that a bulk piece of ferromagnetic material is divided into tiny regions called ''[[magnetic domain]]s''&lt;ref name="Feynman"&gt;
 {{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as ''Weiss domains'').  Within each domain, the spins are aligned, but (if the bulk material is in its lowest energy configuration; i.e. ''unmagnetized''), the spins of separate domains point in different directions and their magnetic fields cancel out, so the object has no net large scale magnetic field.

Ferromagnetic materials spontaneously divide into magnetic domains because the ''[[exchange interaction]]'' is a short-range force, so over long distances of many atoms the tendency of the magnetic dipoles to reduce their energy by orienting in opposite directions wins out. If all the dipoles in a piece of ferromagnetic material are aligned parallel, it creates a large magnetic field extending into the space around it.  This contains a lot of [[magnetostatics|magnetostatic]] energy.  The material can reduce this energy by splitting into many domains pointing in different directions, so the magnetic field is confined to small local fields in the material, reducing the volume of the field. The domains are separated by thin [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]]s a number of molecules thick, in which the direction of magnetization of the dipoles rotates smoothly from one domain's direction to the other.

===Magnetized materials===
[[File:Moving magnetic domains by Zureks.gif|thumb|Moving domain walls in a grain of [[silicon steel]] caused by an increasing external magnetic field in the "downward" direction, observed in a Kerr microscope. White areas are domains with magnetization directed up, dark areas are domains with magnetization directed down.]]

Thus, a piece of iron in its lowest energy state ("unmagnetized") generally has little or no net magnetic field. However, the magnetic domains in a material are not fixed in place; they are simply regions where the spins of the electrons have aligned spontaneously due to their magnetic fields, and thus can be altered by an external magnetic field.  If a strong enough external magnetic field is applied to the material, the domain walls will move by the process of the spins of the electrons in atoms near the wall in one domain turning under the influence of the external field to face in the same direction as the electrons in the other domain, thus reorienting the domains so more of the dipoles are aligned with the external field.  The domains will remain aligned when the external field is removed, creating a magnetic field of their own extending into the space around the material, thus creating a "permanent" magnet. The domains do not go back to their original minimum energy configuration when the field is removed because the domain walls tend to become 'pinned' or 'snagged' on defects in the crystal lattice, preserving their parallel orientation.  This is shown by the [[Barkhausen effect]]: as the magnetizing field is changed, the magnetization changes in thousands of tiny discontinuous jumps as the domain walls suddenly "snap" past defects.

This magnetization as a function of the external field is described by a [[Hysteresis loop|hysteresis curve]]. Although this state of aligned domains found in a piece of magnetized ferromagnetic material is not a minimal-energy configuration, it is [[metastable]], and can persist for long periods, as shown by samples of [[magnetite]] from the sea floor which have maintained their magnetization for millions of years.

Heating and then cooling ([[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]) a magnetized material, subjecting it to vibration by hammering it, or applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field from a [[degaussing|degaussing coil]] tends to release the domain walls from their pinned state, and the domain boundaries tend to move back to a lower energy configuration with less external magnetic field, thus ''[[demagnetization|demagnetizing]]'' the material.

Commercial [[magnet]]s are made of "hard" ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic materials with very large [[magnetic anisotropy]] such as [[alnico]] and [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]], which have a very strong tendency for the magnetization to be pointed along one axis of the crystal, the "easy axis".  During manufacture the materials are subjected to various metallurgical processes in a powerful magnetic field, which aligns the crystal grains so their "easy" axes of magnetization all point in the same direction.  Thus the magnetization, and the resulting magnetic field, is "built in" to the crystal structure of the material, making it very difficult to demagnetize.

===Curie temperature===
{{Main|Curie temperature}}
As the temperature increases, thermal motion, or [[entropy]], competes with the ferromagnetic tendency for dipoles to align. When the temperature rises beyond a certain point, called the [[Curie temperature]], there is a second-order [[phase transition]] and the system can no longer maintain a spontaneous magnetization, so its ability to be magnetized or attracted to a magnet disappears, although it still responds paramagnetically to an external field. Below that temperature, there is a [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] and magnetic moments become aligned with their neighbors. The Curie temperature itself is a [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], where the [[magnetic susceptibility]] is theoretically infinite and, although there is no net magnetization, domain-like spin correlations fluctuate at all length scales.

The study of ferromagnetic phase transitions, especially via the simplified [[Ising model|Ising]] spin model, had an important impact on the development of statistical physics. There, it was first clearly shown that [[mean field theory]] approaches failed to predict the correct behavior at the critical point (which was found to fall under a ''universality class'' that includes many other systems, such as liquid-gas transitions), and had to be replaced by [[renormalization group]] theory.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Originally introduced by [[Yakov Frenkel]] and Tatiana Kontorova in 1938 to describe the structure and dynamics of a crystal lattice near a [[dislocation]] core the FK model has become one of the standard models in [[condensed matter]] physics due to its applicability to describe many physical phenomena.
Physical phenomena which can be modeled by FK model include dislocations, the dynamics of [[Adsorption|adsorbate]] layers on surfaces, crowdions, [[domain wall]]s in magnetically ordered structures, [[long Josephson junction]]s, [[Hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] chains, and DNA type chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kivshar YS,Braun OM |date=2013 |title=The Frenkel-Kontorova Model:Concepts, Methods and Applications |location= |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |page=9 |isbn=978-3662103319 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Frenkel-Kontorova model |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Nonlinear Science |year=2015 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=9781138012141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A modification of the FK model, the [[Tomlinson model]], plays an important role in the field of [[tribology]].

In the continuum-limit approximation the FK model reduces to the exactly integrable [[sine-Gordon]] equation or SG equation which allows for [[soliton]] solutions. For this reason the FK model is also known as the 'discrete sine-Gordon' or 'periodic Klein-Gordon' equation.

== History ==
A simple model of a harmonic chain in a periodic substrate potential was proposed by Ulrich Dehlinger in 1928. Dehlinger derived an approximate analytical expression for the stable solutions of this model which he termed ''Verhakungen'' which correspond to what is today called ''kink pairs''. An essentially similar model was developed by [[Ludwig Prandtl]] in 1912/13 but did not see publication until 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yuri S. Kivshar |first=Oleg M. Braun |date=2013 |title=The Frenkel-Kontorova Model:Concepts, Methods and Applications |location= |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |page=435 |isbn=978-3662103319 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was independently proposed by Yakov Frenkel and Tatiana Kontorova in their 1938 paper ''On the theory of plastic deformation and twinning'' to describe the dynamics of a crystal lattice near a [[dislocation]] and to describe [[crystal twinning]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the standard linear harmonic chain any displacement of the atoms will result in waves and the only stable configuration will be the trivial one.
For the nonlinear chain of Frenkel and Kontorova there exist stable configurations beside the trivial one. For small atomic displacements the situation resembles the linear chain, however for large enough displacements it is possible to create a moving single dislocation for which an analytical solution was derived by Frenkel and Kontorova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Filippov |first=A.T. |date=2010 |title=The Versatile Soliton ''Modern Birkhäuser Classics''|location= |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |page=138 |isbn=9780817649746 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of these dislocations is defined only by the parameters of the system such as the mass and the elastic constant of the springs.

Dislocations, also called [[Soliton|solitons]], are distributed non-local defects and mathematically they are a type of [[topological defect]]. The defining characteristic of solitons/dislocations is that they behave much like stable particles, they can move while maintaining their overall shape. Two solitons of equal and opposite orientation may cancel upon collision but a single soliton can not annihilate spontaneously.

== Generalized model ==

The generalized FK model treats a one-dimensional chain of atoms with nearest neighbor interaction in periodic on-site potential, the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for this system is

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{\cal H}=\frac{m_{a}}{2}\sum_{n}\bigg(\frac{dx_{n}}{dt}\bigg)^{2}+ U&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}            

where the first term is the kinetic energy of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; atoms of mass &lt;math&gt;m_{a}&lt;/math&gt; and the potential energy &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a sum of the potential energy due to the nearest neighbor interaction and that of the substrate potential &lt;math&gt;U=U_{sub}+U_{int}&lt;/math&gt;

The substrate potential is periodic, i.e. &lt;math&gt;U_{sub}(x+a_{s})=U_{sub}(x)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;a_{s}&lt;/math&gt;.

For non harmonic interactions and/or non sinusoidal potential the FK model will give rise to a commensurate-incommensurate phase transition.

The FK model can be applied to any system that can be treated as two coupled sub-systems where one subsystem can be approximated as a linear chain and the second subsystem as a motionless substrate potential.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An example would be the adsorption of a layer onto a crystal surface, here the adsorption layer can be approximated as the chain and the crystal surface as a on-site potential.

== Classical model ==
In this section we examine in detail the simplest form of the FK model. A detailed version of this derivation can be found in the following paper.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The model, shown schematically in figure 1, describes a one-dimensional chain of atoms with a harmonic nearest neighbor interaction and subject to a sinusoidal potential. Transverse motion of the atoms is ignored, i.e. the atoms can only move along the chain. 
The Hamiltonian for this situation is given by &lt;math&gt;(1)&lt;/math&gt; where we specify the interaction potential to be

&lt;math&gt;
U_{int}=\frac{g}{2}\sum_{n}(x_{n+1} -x_{n}-a_{0})^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic constant and &lt;math&gt;a_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is the inter-atomic equilibrium distance. The substrate potential is

&lt;math&gt;
    U_{sub}=\frac{\epsilon_{s}}{2}\sum_{n}\bigg[1-\cos\bigg(\frac{2\pi x_{n}}{a_{s}}\bigg)\bigg]
&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{s}&lt;/math&gt; the amplitude and &lt;math&gt;a_{s}&lt;/math&gt; the period.

The following dimensionless variables are introduced in order to rewrite the Hamiltonian:

&lt;math&gt;x_{n}\rightarrow \bigg(\frac{2\pi}{a_{s}}\bigg)x_{n},\qquad
t\rightarrow \bigg(\frac{2\pi}{a_{s}}\bigg)\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{s}}{2m_{a}}}t,\qquad
a_{0}\rightarrow \frac{2\pi}{a_{s}},\qquad
g \rightarrow g\frac{a_{s}/2\pi^{2}}{\epsilon_{s}/2}&lt;/math&gt;

In dimensionless form the Hamiltonian is

&lt;math&gt;
    H=\frac{\cal H}{\epsilon_{s}/2}=\sum_{n}\bigg[\frac{1}{2}\frac{dx_{n}}{dt}^{2}+(1-\cos x_{n}+\frac{1}{2}g(x_{n+1}-x_{n}-a_{0})^{2}\bigg]
&lt;/math&gt;

which describes a harmonic chain of atoms of unit mass in a sinusoidal potential of period &lt;math&gt;a_{s}=2\pi&lt;/math&gt; with amplitude &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{s}=2&lt;/math&gt;. The equation of motion for this Hamiltonian is

&lt;math&gt;
    \frac{d^{2}x_{n}}{dt^{2}}+ \sin x_{n}-g(x_{n+1}+x_{n-1}-2x_{n})=0
&lt;/math&gt;

We consider only the case where &lt;math&gt;a_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{s}&lt;/math&gt; are commensurate, for simplicity we take &lt;math&gt;a_{0}=a_{s}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus in the ground state of the chain each minimum of the substrate potential is occupied by one atom.
We introduce the variable &lt;math&gt;u_{n}&lt;/math&gt; for atomic displacements which is defined by

&lt;math&gt;
    x_{n}=na_{s}+u_{n}
&lt;/math&gt;

For small displacements &lt;math&gt;u_{n}\ll a_{s}&lt;/math&gt; the equation of motion may be linearized and takes the following form

&lt;math&gt;
    \frac{d^{2} u_{n}}{dt^{2}}+u_{n}-g(u_{n+1}+u_{n-1}-2u_{n})=0
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation of motion describes [[phonon]]s with &lt;math&gt;u_{n}\propto \exp[i(\omega_{ph}(\kappa)t-\kappa n)]&lt;/math&gt; with the phonon dispersion relation &lt;math&gt;\omega_{ph}^{2}(\kappa)=\omega_{min}^{2}+2g(1-\cos \kappa)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|\kappa|\leq \pi&lt;/math&gt; the dimensionless wavenumber. This shows that the frequency spectrum of the chain has a [[band gap]] &lt;math&gt;\omega_{min}\equiv \omega_{ph}(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; with cut-off frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_{max}\equiv \omega_{ph}(\pi)=\sqrt{\omega_{min}^{2}+4g}&lt;/math&gt;.

The linearised equation of motion are not valid when the atomic displacements are not small and one must use the nonlinear equation of motion.
The nonlinear equations can support new types of localized excitations which are best illuminated by considering the continuum limit approximation of the FK model. Applying the standard procedure of Rosenau&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenau |first1=P |last2= |first2= |date=1986 |title=Dynamics of nonlinear mass-spring chains near the continuum limit |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0375960186901702 |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=222–227 |doi=10.1016/0375-9601(86)90170-2 |access-date= |bibcode=1986PhLA..118..222R}}&lt;/ref&gt; to derive continuum limit equations from a discrete lattice results in the perturbed sine-Gordon equation
&lt;math&gt;
    u_{tt}+\sin u-(a_{s}^{2}g)u_{xx}=\epsilon f(u)
&lt;/math&gt;
here the function &lt;math&gt;\epsilon f(u)&lt;/math&gt; describes in first order the effects due to the discreteness of the chain.

&lt;math&gt;
    \epsilon f(u)=\frac{1}{12}a_{s}^{2}(u_{xxtt}+u_{x}^{2}\sin u - u_{xx}\cos u)
&lt;/math&gt;

Neglecting the discreteness effects and introducing &lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow \frac{x}{a_{s}\sqrt{g}}&lt;/math&gt; reduces the equation of motion to the sine-Gordon (SG) equation in its standard form.

&lt;math&gt;
    u_{tt}-u_{xx}+ \sin u=0
&lt;/math&gt;

The SG equation gives rise to three elementary excitations/solutions: kinks, breathers and phonons. Kinks, or topological solitons, can be understood as the solution connecting two nearest identical minima of the periodic substrate potential, thus they are a result of the degeneracy of the ground state.

&lt;math&gt;
    u_{k}(x,t)=4 \tan^{-1}(\exp[-\sigma \gamma (v)(x-vt)])
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma =\pm 1&lt;/math&gt; is the topological charge, for &lt;math&gt;\sigma=1&lt;/math&gt; the solution is called a kink and for &lt;math&gt;\sigma=-1&lt;/math&gt; it is an antikink. The kink width &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the kink velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is measured in units of the sound velocity &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and is &lt;math&gt;\gamma(v)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;. For kink motion with &lt;math&gt;v^{2}\ll c^{2}&lt;/math&gt; the width approximates 1.
The energy of the kink in dimensionless units is

&lt;math&gt;
    E_{k}=mc^{2}\gamma(v)\approx mc^{2}+\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

from which the rest mass of the kink follows as &lt;math&gt;m=\frac{2}{\pi^{2}\sqrt{g}}&lt;/math&gt; and the kinks rest energy as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{k}=mc^{2}=8\sqrt{g}&lt;/math&gt;.

Two neighboring static kinks with distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; will have energy of repulsion
&lt;math&gt;
    v_{int}\approx\epsilon_{k}\sinh^{-2}\bigg(\frac{R}{2a_{s}\sqrt{g}}\bigg)
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas kink and antikink will attract with interaction
&lt;math&gt;
    v_{int}(R)\approx -\epsilon_{k}\cosh^{-2}\bigg(\frac{R}{2a_{s}\sqrt{g}}\bigg)
&lt;/math&gt;

A breather is

&lt;math&gt;
 u_{br}(x,t)=4\tan^{-1}\bigg[\bigg(\frac{\sqrt{1-\Omega^{2}}}{\Omega}\bigg)\frac{\sin(\Omega t)}{\cosh(x\sqrt{1-\Omega^{2}}}\bigg]   
&lt;/math&gt;

which describes nonlinear oscillation with frequency &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\Omega&lt;\omega_{min}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon_{br}=2 \epsilon_{k}\sqrt{1-\Omega^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

for low frequencies &lt;math&gt;\Omega\ll 1&lt;/math&gt; the breather can be seen as a coupled kink-antikink pair. Kinks and breathers can move along the chain without any dissipative energy loss. Furthermore, any collision between all the excitations of the SG equation will result in only a phase shift. Thus kinks and breathers may be considered ''nonlinear [[quasi-particle]]s'' of the SG model. For nearly integrable modifications of the SG equation such as the  continuum-approximation of the FK model kinks can be considered ''deformable'' quasi-particles, provided that discreetness effects are small.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The Peierls–Nabarro potential ==
In the preceding section the excitations of the FK model were derived by considering the model in a continuum-limit approximation. Since the properties of kinks are only modified slightly by the discreteness of the primary model, the SG equation can adequately describe most features and dynamics of the system.

The discrete lattice does, however, influence the kink motion in a unique way with the existence of the Peierls–Nabarro (PN) potential &lt;math&gt;V_{PN}(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the kink's center. The existence of the PN potential is due to the lack of [[Translational symmetry|translational invariance]] in a discrete chain. In the continuum limit the system is invariant for any translation of the kink along the chain. For a discrete chain only those translations that are an integer multiple of the lattice spacing &lt;math&gt;a_{s}&lt;/math&gt; leave the system invariant. The PN barrier, &lt;math&gt;E_{PN}&lt;/math&gt;, is the smallest energy barrier for a kink to overcome so that it can move through the lattice. The value of the PN barrier is the difference between the kink's potential energy for a stable and unstable stationary configuration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The stationary configurations are shown schematically in figure 2.[[File:StabFK.png|thumb|Stationary configuration for the FK model for a single kink. Top image corresponds to a stable configuration. Bottom image corresponds to an unstable configuration]]

[[File:VoltaBattery.JPG|thumb|A [[voltaic pile]], the first chemical battery]]

[[Electric battery|Batteries]] provided the main source of [[electricity]] before the development of [[electric generator]]s and [[electrical grid]]s around the end of the 19th century.  Successive improvements in battery technology facilitated major electrical advances, from early scientific studies to the rise of [[telegraph]]s and [[telephone]]s, eventually leading to [[portable computer]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, [[electric car]]s, and many other electrical devices.

Scientists and engineers developed several commercially important types of battery. "Wet cells" were open containers that held liquid [[electrolyte]] and metallic [[electrode]]s. When the electrodes were completely consumed, the wet cell was renewed by replacing the electrodes and electrolyte. Open containers are unsuitable for mobile or portable use. Wet cells were used commercially in the  telegraph and telephone systems. Early electric cars used semi-sealed wet cells.

One important classification for batteries is by their life cycle. "Primary" batteries can produce current as soon as assembled, but once the active elements are consumed, they cannot be electrically recharged. The development of the lead-acid battery and subsequent "secondary" or "rechargeable" types allowed energy to be restored to the cell, extending the life of permanently assembled cells. The introduction of nickel and lithium based batteries in the latter 20th century made the development of innumerable portable electronic devices feasible, from powerful [[flashlight]]s to mobile phones. Very large stationary batteries find some applications in [[grid energy storage]],  helping to stabilize electric power distribution networks.

== Experiments ==

[[File:Leidse flessen Museum Boerhave december 2003 2.jpg|thumb|A ''battery'' of linked glass [[capacitor]]s ([[Leyden jar]]s)]]

In 1749, [[Benjamin Franklin]], the U.S. [[polymath]] and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding father]], first used the term "battery" to describe a set of linked [[capacitor]]s he used for his experiments with electricity. These capacitors were panels of glass coated with metal on each surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=3&amp;page=352a |title=Benjamin Franklin et al.; Leonard W. Labaree, ed., '&amp;#39;The Papers of Benjamin Franklin'&amp;#39; (New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 1961) vol. 3, page 352: Letter to Peter Collinson, April 29, 1749. paragraph 18 |publisher=Franklinpapers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These capacitors were charged with a [[Electrostatic generator|static generator]] and discharged by touching metal to their [[electrode]]. Linking them together in a "battery" gave a stronger discharge.  Originally having the generic meaning of "a group of two or more similar objects functioning together", as in an artillery battery, the term came to be used for [[voltaic pile]]s and similar devices in which many [[electrochemical cell]]s were connected together in the manner of [[Franklin's capacitor]]s.  Today even a single electrochemical cell, e.g. a [[dry cell]], is commonly called a battery.

==Invention ==
There is a disputed claim for a very early battery, the [[Baghdad Battery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2804257.stm#story Riddle of 'Baghdad's batteries'], BBC, 27 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt; If it was real, it was soon forgotten.

[[File:trough battery.jpg|thumb|The trough battery, which was in essence a Voltaic Pile laid down to prevent [[electrolyte]] leakage]]
In 1780, [[Luigi Galvani]] was dissecting a frog affixed to a [[brass]] hook. When he touched its leg with his iron scalpel, the leg twitched. Galvani believed the energy that drove this contraction came from the leg itself, and called it "animal electricity".

However, [[Alessandro Volta]], a friend and fellow scientist, disagreed, believing this phenomenon was caused by two different metals joined together by a moist intermediary. He verified this hypothesis through experiment, and published the results in 1791. In 1800, Volta invented the first true battery, which came to be known as the [[voltaic pile]]. The voltaic pile consisted of pairs of [[copper]] and [[zinc]] discs piled on top of each other, separated by a layer of cloth or cardboard soaked in [[brine]] (i.e., the [[electrolyte]]). Unlike the [[Leyden jar]], the voltaic pile produced a continuous electricity and stable current, and lost little charge over time when not in use, though his early models could not produce a voltage strong enough to produce sparks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bernard S. |last=Finn |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/powering/past/prehist.htm |title=Origin of Electrical Power |publisher=National Museum of American History |date=September 2002 |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He experimented with various metals and found that zinc and silver gave the best results.

Volta believed the current was the result of two different materials simply touching each other—an [[superseded scientific theories|obsolete scientific theory]] known as [[contact tension]]—and not the result of chemical reactions. As a consequence, he regarded the corrosion of the zinc plates as an unrelated flaw that could perhaps be fixed by changing the materials somehow. However, no scientist ever succeeded in preventing this corrosion. In fact, it was observed that the corrosion was faster when a higher current was drawn. This suggested that the corrosion was actually integral to the battery's ability to produce a current. This, in part, led to the rejection of Volta's [[contact tension|contact tension theory]] in favor of electrochemical theory. Volta's illustrations of his Crown of Cups and voltaic pile have extra metal disks, now known to be unnecessary, on both the top and bottom. The figure associated with this section, of the zinc-copper voltaic pile, has the modern design, an indication that "contact tension" is not the source of [[electromotive force]] for the voltaic pile.

Volta's original pile models had some technical flaws, one of them involving the [[electrolyte]] leaking and causing short-circuits due to the weight of the discs compressing the brine-soaked cloth. A Scotsman named [[William Cruickshank (chemist)|William Cruickshank]] solved this problem by laying the elements in a box instead of piling them in a stack. This was known as the [[trough battery]].&lt;ref name="Trough Battery"&gt;{{cite web | author = Institute and Museum of the History of Science | title = Trough Battery | url = http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/museum/esim.asp?c=100497 | accessdate = 2007-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Volta himself invented a variant that consisted of a chain of cups filled with a salt solution, linked together by metallic arcs dipped into the liquid. This was known as the Crown of Cups. These arcs were made of two different metals (e.g., zinc and copper) soldered together. This model also proved to be more efficient than his original piles,&lt;ref name=Decker&gt;{{cite web|last=Decker |first=Franco |work=Electrochemistry Encyclopedia |title=Volta and the 'Pile' |date=January 2005 |publisher=Case Western Reserve University |url=http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-v01-volta.htm |accessdate=2012-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716205546/http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-v01-volta.htm |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though it did not prove as popular.

[[File:Voltaic pile.svg|left|thumb|A zinc-copper voltaic pile]]

Another problem with Volta's batteries was short battery life (an hour's worth at best), which was caused by two phenomena. The first was that the current produced electrolysed the electrolyte solution, resulting in a film of [[hydrogen]] bubbles forming on the [[copper]], which steadily increased the internal resistance of the battery (this effect, called ''polarization'', is counteracted in modern cells by additional measures). The other was a phenomenon called ''local action'', wherein minute short-circuits would form around impurities in the zinc, causing the zinc to degrade. The latter problem was solved in 1835 by [[William Sturgeon]], who found that amalgamated zinc, whose surface had been treated with some [[mercury (element)|mercury]], didn't suffer from local action.&lt;ref name="The Electromagnetic Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/morse/morse.htm|title=The Electromagnetic Telegraph|last=Calvert|first=James B.|year=2000|work=|accessdate=2007-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its flaws, Volta's batteries provided a steadier current than Leyden jars, and made possible many new experiments and discoveries, such as the first electrolysis of water by Anthony Carlisle and William Nicholson.

==First practical batteries==

===Daniell cell===
[[File:Daniel cell.png|thumb|Schematic representation of Daniell's original cell]]
A British chemist named [[John Frederic Daniell]] found a way to solve the hydrogen bubble problem in the Voltaic Pile by using a second electrolyte to consume the hydrogen produced by the first. In 1836 he invented the [[Daniell cell]], which consisted of a copper pot filled with a [[copper sulfate]] solution, in which was immersed an unglazed [[earthenware]] container filled with [[sulfuric acid]] and a zinc electrode. The [[earthenware]] barrier was porous, which allowed [[ion]]s to pass through but kept the solutions from mixing.

The Daniell cell was a great improvement over the existing technology used in the early days of [[battery (electricity)|battery]] development and was the first practical source of electricity. It provided a longer and more reliable current than the Voltaic cell. It was also safer and less corrosive. It had an operating voltage of roughly 1.1 volts. It soon became the industry standard for use, especially with the new [[telegraph]] networks.

The Daniell cell was also used as a working standard for definition of the [[volt]], which is the unit of electromotive force. &lt;ref&gt; http://seaus.free.fr/spip.php?article964  ''History of the electrical units'', retrieved Feb 23, 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the Daniell cell was invented in 1837 by the [[Guy's hospital]] physician [[Golding Bird]] who used a [[plaster of Paris]] barrier to keep the solutions separate.  Bird's experiments with this cell were of some importance to the new discipline of [[electrometallurgy]].

===Porous pot cell===
[[File:Élément Daniell.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Porous pot cell]]
The porous pot version of the Daniell cell was invented by [[John Dancer]], a Liverpool instrument maker, in 1838. It consists of a central [[zinc]] [[anode]] dipped into a porous earthenware pot containing a [[zinc sulfate]] solution. The [[porous]] pot is, in turn, immersed in a solution of [[copper sulfate]] contained in a [[copper]] can, which acts as the cell's [[cathode]]. The use of a porous barrier allows ions to pass through but keeps the solutions from mixing.

===Gravity cell===
[[File:gravity cell.gif|left|thumb|A 1919 illustration of a [[gravity cell]]. This particular variant is also known as a crowfoot cell due to distinctive shape of the electrodes]]
In the 1860s, a Frenchman named Callaud invented a variant of the Daniell cell called the [[gravity cell]]. This simpler version dispensed with the porous barrier. This reduced the internal resistance of the system and, thus, the battery yielded a stronger current. It quickly became the battery of choice for the American and British telegraph networks, and was used until the 1950s. 

The gravity cell consisted of a glass jar, in which a copper cathode sat on the bottom and a zinc anode was suspended beneath the rim. Copper sulfate crystals would be scattered around the cathode and then the jar would be filled with distilled water. As the current was drawn, a layer of zinc sulfate solution would form at the top around the anode. This top layer was kept separate from the bottom copper sulfate layer by its lower density and by the polarity of the cell.

The zinc sulfate layer was clear in contrast to the deep blue copper sulfate layer, which allowed a technician to measure the battery life with a glance. On the other hand, this setup meant the battery could be used only in a stationary appliance, else the solutions would mix or spill. Another disadvantage was that a current had to be continually drawn to keep the two solutions from mixing by diffusion, so it was unsuitable for intermittent use.

=== Poggendorff cell ===
The German scientist [[Johann Christian Poggendorff]] overcame the problems with separating the electrolyte and the depolariser using a porous earthenware pot in 1842.  In the [[Poggendorff cell]], sometimes called Grenet Cell due to the works of [[Eugene Grenet]] around 1859, the electrolyte was dilute sulphuric acid and the depolariser was chromic acid. The two acids were physically mixed together eliminating the porous pot. The positive electrode (cathode) was two carbon plates, with a zinc plate (negative or anode) positioned between them. Because of the tendency of the acid mixture to react with the zinc, a mechanism was provided to raise the zinc electrode clear of the acids.

The cell provided 1.9 volts. It proved popular with experimenters for many years due to its relatively high voltage; greater ability to produce a consistent current and lack of any fumes, but the relative fragility of its thin glass enclosure and the necessity of having to raise the zinc plate when the cell was not in use eventually saw it fall out of favour. The cell was also known as the 'chromic acid cell', but principally as the 'bichromate cell'. This latter name came from the practice of producing the chromic acid by adding sulphuric acid to potassium dichromate, even though the cell itself contained no dichromate.

The Fuller cell was developed from the Poggendorff cell. Although the chemistry was principally the same, the two acids were once again separated by a porous container and the zinc was treated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to form an [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]].

===Grove cell===
The [[Grove cell]] was invented by Welshman [[William Robert Grove]] in 1839. It consisted of a [[zinc]] anode dipped in [[sulfuric acid]] and a [[platinum]] [[cathode]] dipped in [[nitric acid]], separated by porous [[earthenware]]. The Grove cell provided a high current and nearly twice the voltage of the Daniell cell, which made it the favoured cell of the American telegraph networks for a time. However, it gave off poisonous [[nitric oxide]] fumes when operated. The voltage also dropped sharply as the charge diminished, which became a liability as telegraph networks grew more complex. [[Platinum]] was also very expensive.

===Dun cell===
Alfred Dun 1885, nitro-muriatic acid (''[[Aqua regia|aqua regis]]'') - Iron &amp; Carbon
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the new element there can be used advantageously as exciting-liquid in the first case such solutions as have in a concentrated condition great depolarizing-power, which effect the whole depolarization chemically without necessitating the mechanical expedient of increased carbon surface. It is preferred to use iron as the positive electrode, and as exciting-liquid nitro muriatic acid, (''aqua regis'',) the mixture consisting of muriatic and nitric acids. The nitro-muriatic acid, as explained above, serves for filling both cells. For the carbon-cells it is used strong or very slightly diluted, but for the other cells very diluted, (about one-twentieth, or at the most one-tenth.) The element containing in one cell carbon and concentrated nitro-muriatic acid and in the other cell iron and dilute nitro-muriatic acid remains constant for at least twenty hours when employed for electric incandescent lighting. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=FIFRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT80&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U0KaRnCizZff3dWXcwKduG3xfSSdQ&amp;ci=465%2C1013%2C413%2C370&amp;edge=0 p.&amp;nbsp;80] at Google Books)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Rechargeable batteries and dry cells==

===Lead-acid===
[[File:Plante lead acid cell.jpg|thumb|19th-century illustration of Planté's original lead-acid cell]]
Up to this point, all existing batteries would be permanently drained when all their chemical reactions were spent. In 1859, [[Gaston Planté]] invented the [[lead–acid battery]], the first-ever battery that could be recharged by passing a reverse current through it. A lead acid cell consists of a lead [[anode]] and a [[lead dioxide]] cathode immersed in [[sulfuric acid]]. Both electrodes react with the acid to produce [[lead sulfate]], but the reaction at the lead anode releases electrons whilst the reaction at the lead dioxide consumes them, thus producing a current. These chemical reactions can be reversed by passing a reverse current through the battery, thereby recharging it.

Planté's first model consisted of two lead sheets separated by rubber strips and rolled into a spiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Biographies/PlantelBio.htm |title=Gaston Planté (1834-1889) |publisher=Corrosion Doctors |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His batteries were first used to power the lights in train carriages while stopped at a station{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}. In 1881, [[Camille Alphonse Faure]] invented an improved version that consisted of a lead grid lattice into which a lead oxide paste was pressed, forming a plate. Multiple plates could be stacked for greater performance. This design was easier to mass-produce.

Compared to other batteries, Planté's was rather heavy and bulky for the amount of energy it could hold. However, it could produce remarkably large currents in surges. It also had very low internal resistance, meaning that a single battery could be used to power multiple circuits.&lt;ref name="The Electromagnetic Telegraph"/&gt;

The lead-acid battery is still used today in automobiles and other applications where weight is not a big factor. The basic principle has not changed since 1859. In the early 1930s, a [[gel electrolyte]] (instead of a liquid) produced by adding [[silica]] to a charged cell was used in the [[Battery (vacuum tube)#A battery|LT battery]] of portable [[vacuum-tube radio]]s. In the 1970s, "sealed" versions became common (commonly known as a "[[gel cell]]" or "[[Gel battery|SLA]]"), allowing the battery to be used in different positions without failure or leakage.

Today cells are classified as "primary" if they produce a current only until their chemical [[reactant]]s are exhausted, and "secondary" if the chemical reactions can be reversed by recharging the cell. The lead-acid cell was the first "secondary" cell.

=== Leclanché cell ===
[[File:Leclanche cell.gif|thumb|A 1912 illustration of a [[Leclanché cell]]]]
In 1866, [[Georges Leclanché]] invented [[Leclanché cell|a battery]] that consisted of a zinc anode and a [[manganese dioxide]] cathode wrapped in a porous material, dipped in a jar of [[ammonium chloride]] solution. The manganese dioxide cathode had a little carbon mixed into it as well, which improved conductivity and absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/electromag/electricity/batteries/zinccarbon.html |title=Zinc-Carbon Batteries |publisher=Molecular Expressions |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provided a voltage of 1.4 volts.&lt;ref&gt;The Boy Electrician by J.W.Simms M.I.E.E. (Page 61)&lt;/ref&gt; This cell achieved very quick success in telegraphy, signalling and electric bell work.

The [[dry cell]] form was used to power early telephones—usually from an adjacent wooden box affixed to the wall—before telephones could draw power from the telephone line itself. The Leclanché cell could not provide a sustained current for very long. In lengthy conversations, the battery would run down, rendering the conversation inaudible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Battery Facts | title = Leclanché Cell | url = http://www.batteryfacts.plus.com/BatteryHistory/Leclanche.html | accessdate = 2007-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because certain chemical reactions in the cell increased the internal resistance and, thus, lowered the voltage. These reactions reversed themselves when the battery was left idle, so it was good only for intermittent use.&lt;ref name="The Electromagnetic Telegraph"/&gt;

=== Zinc-carbon cell, the first dry cell ===

Many experimenters tried to immobilize the electrolyte of an electrochemical cell to make it more convenient to use. The [[Zamboni pile]] of 1812 was a high-voltage dry battery but capable of delivering only minute currents. Various experiments were made with [[cellulose]], [[sawdust]], [[spun glass]], [[asbestos]] fibers, and [[gelatine]].&lt;ref&gt;W. E. Ayrton ''Practical Electricity; A Laboratory and Lecture Course for First Year ...'' 1897, reprint Read Books, 2008 {{ISBN|1-4086-9150-7}}, page 458&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, [[Carl Gassner]] obtained a German patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|inventor=Carl Gassner, Jr.|country=DE|number=37758|status=patent|gdate=1886-04-08|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US373064}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a variant of the Leclanché cell, which came to be known as the [[dry cell]] because it did not have a free liquid electrolyte. Instead, the [[ammonium chloride]] was mixed with [[plaster of Paris]] to create a paste, with a small amount of [[zinc chloride]] added in to extend the shelf life. The [[manganese dioxide]] cathode was dipped in this paste, and both were sealed in a zinc shell, which also acted as the anode. In November 1887, he obtained {{US Patent|373064}} for the same device.

Unlike previous wet cells, Gassner's dry cell was more solid, did not require maintenance, did not spill, and could be used in any orientation. It provided a potential of 1.5 volts. The first mass-produced model was the Columbia dry cell, first marketed by the [[National Carbon Company]] in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Columbia Dry Cell Battery | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/drycellbattery.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCC improved Gassner's model by replacing the plaster of Paris with coiled [[cardboard]], an innovation that left more space for the cathode and made the battery easier to assemble. It was the first convenient battery for the masses and made portable electrical devices practical, and led directly to the invention of the [[flashlight]].

The [[zinc–carbon battery]] (as it came to be known) is still manufactured today.

In parallel, in 1887 [[Wilhelm Hellesen]] developed his own dry cell design. It has been claimed that Hellesen's design preceded that of Gassner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmuseet.dk/pdfer/hellesenskorrektur.pdf ''Energi på dåse'', Jytte Thorndahl. Last accessed on June 26, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002618/http://www.elmuseet.dk/pdfer/hellesenskorrektur.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, a dry-battery was developed by [[Yai Sakizō]] ([[:ja:屋井先蔵|屋井 先蔵]]) of Japan, then patented in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baj.or.jp/e/knowledge/history01.html |work=The history of the battery | title = The Yai dry-battery |publisher=Battery association of Japan |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sut.ac.jp/info/publish/gakuhou/153/space3_3.html |title=乾電池の発明者は日本人だった　理大ゆかりの屋井先蔵 |publisher=Tokyo University of Science |date=2004-07-07 |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, Yai Sakizō's dry-battery was exhibited in [[World's Columbian Exposition]] and commanded considerable international attention.

===NiCd, the first alkaline battery===
In 1899, a Swedish scientist named [[Waldemar Jungner]] invented the [[nickel–cadmium battery]], a rechargeable battery that had [[nickel]] and [[cadmium]] electrodes in a [[potassium hydroxide]] solution; the first battery to use an [[alkaline]] electrolyte. It was commercialized in Sweden in 1910 and reached the United States in 1946. The first models were robust and had significantly better energy density than lead-acid batteries, but were much more expensive.

==20th century: new technologies and ubiquity==

===Nickel-iron===
[[File:Thomas Edison's nickel–iron batteries.jpg|thumb|Nickel-iron batteries manufactured between 1972 and 1975 under the "Exide" brand, originally developed in 1901 by Thomas Edison.]]
[[File:AccuEvolution.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A set of modern batteries]]
Jungner had invented a [[nickel–iron battery]] in 1899, the same year as his Ni-Cad battery, but found it to be inferior to its cadmium counterpart and, as a consequence, never bothered patenting it. It produced a lot more hydrogen gas when being charged, meaning it could not be sealed, and the charging process was less efficient (it was, however, cheaper). [[Thomas Edison]] picked up Jungner's nickel-iron battery design, patented it himself and sold it in 1903. Edison wanted to commercialise a more lightweight and durable substitute for the lead-acid battery that powered some early automobiles, and hoped that by doing so electric cars would become the standard, with his firm as its main battery vendor. However, customers found his first model to be prone to leakage and short battery life, and it did not outperform the lead-acid cell by much either. Although Edison was able to produce a more reliable and powerful model seven years later, by this time the inexpensive and reliable [[Model T Ford]] had made gasoline engine cars the standard. Nevertheless, Edison's battery achieved great success in other applications such as electric and diesel-electric rail vehicles, providing backup power for railroad crossing signals, or to provide power for the lamps used in mines.&lt;ref name=ermsys&gt;{{cite web|title=Systematic design of an autonomous hybrid locomotive &amp;#124; EUrailmag |url=http://eurailmag.com/systematic-design-of-an-autonomous/|date=|accessdate=2013-04-17|publisher=eurailmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=azry&gt;{{cite web|title=Magma #10 Project|url=http://www.azrymuseum.org/Projects/Magma_10/Magma_10.htm|date=2012-05-15|accessdate=2013-04-17|publisher=azrymuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common alkaline batteries===
Until the late 1950s the [[zinc–carbon battery]] continued to be a popular primary cell battery, but its relatively low battery life hampered sales. In 1955, an engineer named [[Lewis Urry]], working for [[Union Carbide]] at the [[National Carbon Company]] Parma Research Laboratory, was tasked with finding a way to extend the life of zinc-carbon batteries, but Urry decided instead that [[alkaline batteries]] held more promise. Until then, longer-lasting [[alkaline]] batteries were unfeasibly expensive. Urry's battery consisted of a [[manganese dioxide]] cathode and a [[powdered zinc]] anode with an alkaline [[electrolyte]]. Using powdered zinc gave the anode a greater surface area. These batteries hit the market in 1959.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Nickel-hydrogen and nickel metal-hydride===
The [[nickel–hydrogen battery]] entered the market as an energy-storage subsystem for commercial [[communication satellite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=59267 |title=A nickel/hydrogen battery for PV systems |doi=10.1109/62.59267 |publisher=IEEE Xplore |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/jaPreview/JE/1982/PVJAPRE62569.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318050754/http://pdf.aiaa.org/jaPreview/JE/1982/PVJAPRE62569.pdf|archive-date=2009-03-18|title=Nickel-Hydrogen Battery Technology—Development and Status |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first consumer grade [[nickel–metal hydride batteries]] (NiMH) for smaller applications appeared on the market in 1989 as a variation of the 1970s [[nickel–hydrogen battery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sponsored by |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?STORY_ID=10789409 |title=In search of the perfect battery |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; NiMH batteries tend to have longer lifespans than NiCd batteries (and their lifespans continue to increase as manufacturers experiment with new alloys) and, since [[cadmium]] is toxic, NiMH batteries are less damaging to the environment.

===Lithium and lithium-ion batteries===
[[File:Lithium Battery1.jpg|thumb|Lithium Ion Battery]]
[[Lithium]] is the metal with lowest density and with the greatest [[electrochemical potential]] and [[energy-to-weight ratio]].  The low atomic weight and small size of its ions also speeds its diffusion, suggesting that it would make an ideal material for batteries. Experimentation with [[lithium batteries]] began in 1912 under [[Gilbert N. Lewis | G.N. Lewis]], but commercial lithium batteries did not come to market until the 1970s{{cn|date=August 2018}}.  Three volt lithium primary cells such as the CR123A type and three volt button cells are still widely used, especially in cameras and very small devices. 

Three important developments marked the 1980s. In 1980 an American chemist, [[John B. Goodenough]], discovered the LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode (positive lead) and a Moroccan research scientist, [[Rachid Yazami]], discovered the [[graphite]] anode (negative lead) with the solid electrolyte. In 1981, Japanese chemists [[Tokio Yamabe]] and [[Shizukuni Yata]] discovered a novel nano-carbonacious-PAS (polyacene,) &lt;ref&gt;T. Yamabe,　K. Tanaka, K. Ohzeki, and S.Yata, Solid State Communications, 44,823, (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; and found that it was very effective for the anode in the conventional liquid electrolyte. &lt;ref&gt;S. Yata, U.S. Patent #4,601,849&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Shizukuni Yata, Kazuyoshi Tanaka and Tokio Yamabe, Polyacene (PAS) Batteries, MRS Proceedings, Volume 496,1997&lt;/ref&gt; This led a research team managed by [[Akira Yoshino]] of [[Asahi Chemical]], Japan, to build the first [[lithium-ion battery]] prototype in 1985, a rechargeable and more stable version of the lithium battery; [[Sony]] commercialized the [[lithium-ion battery]] in 1991. &lt;ref&gt;P. Novak, K. Muller, K. S. V. Santhanam, O. Haas, Electrochemically Active Polymers for Rechargeable Batteries, Chem. Rev., 97, p.272 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[lithium polymer battery]] was released by Sony and Asahi Kasei. These batteries hold their electrolyte in a solid polymer composite instead of in a liquid solvent, and the electrodes and separators are laminated to each other. The latter difference allows the battery to be encased in a flexible wrapping instead of in a rigid metal casing, which means such batteries can be specifically shaped to fit a particular device. This advantage has favored lithium polymer batteries in the design of portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and [[personal digital assistant]]s, and of [[radio-controlled aircraft]], as such batteries allow for more flexible and compact design. They generally have a lower [[energy density]] than normal lithium-ion batteries.

'''Lanthanum gallium silicate''' (referred to as LGS in this article), also known as '''langasite''', has a chemical formula of the form ''A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' indicate particular [[cation]] sites. ''A'' is a decahedral (Thomson cube) site coordinated by 8 oxygen atoms. ''B'' is octahedral site coordinated by 6 oxygen atoms, and ''C'' and ''D'' are tetrahedral sites coordinated by 4 oxygen atoms. In this material, [[lanthanum]] occupied the ''A''-sites, [[gallium]] the ''B'', ''C'' and half of ''D''-sites, and, [[silicon]] the other half of ''D''-sites. The crystal structure is shown below:

LGS is a [[piezoelectric]] material,&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=398330 Polishing and Etching Langasite and Quartz], Laffey SH and Vig JR, 1994 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium {{doi|10.1109/FREQ.1994.398330}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no phase transitions up to its melting point of 1470 °C. Single crystal LGS can be grown via the [[Czochralski method]], in which crystallization is initiated on a rotating seed crystal lowered into the melt followed by pulling from the melt. The growth atmosphere is usually [[argon]] or [[nitrogen]] with up to 5% of [[oxygen]]. The use of [[oxygen]] in the growth environment is reported to suppress [[gallium]] loss from the melt; however, too high an [[oxygen]] level can lead to [[platinum]] (crucible material used for the melt) dissolution in the melt. The growth of LGS is primarily along the z direction. Currently the 3-inch (76&amp;nbsp;mm) langasite boules produced commercially have growth rates of 1.5 to 5&amp;nbsp;mm/h. The quality of the crystals tends to improve as the growth rate is reduced.

Four Wings and a Prayer,(2002), Kindle edition location 1594. New York, New York: Random House.{{ISBN|978-0-307-78720-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also makes some of them important [[pest (organism)|pest]]s in [[agriculture]] or forestry. The host plants have yet to be determined for some species. There is not always consensus among [[lepidopterist]]s over the listing of suitable plants.

Adult females normally lay their eggs on or near specific food plants (which often have to be abundant enough). Lepidopteran larvae can often be raised on a variety food plants and commercial mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Artificial Butterfly Diets |publisher=Educational Science

&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related Lepidoptera tend to have similar food plant preferences. Many caterpillars sequester the toxins from their food plants and use them as a defense against predators.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is common for Lepidoptera to prefer a certain plant [[genus]] or [[family (biology)|family]], some species feed on a narrow selection of unrelated taxa. The choice is unrelated to nectar plant preferences of adult Lepidoptera, which are much less strict.

'''Lauric acid''' or systematically, '''dodecanoic acid''', is a [[saturated fat|saturated]] [[fatty acid]] with a 12-carbon atom chain, thus having many properties of [[Medium-chain triglyceride|medium-chain fatty acids]], is a bright white, powdery solid with a faint odor of bay oil or soap.  The [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[ester]]s of lauric acid are known as '''laurates'''.

Although 95% of medium-chain triglycerides are absorbed through the [[portal vein]], only 25-30% of lauric acid is absorbed through it.&lt;ref name="pmid26946252"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Eyres L, Eyres MF, Chisholm A, Brown RC | title=Coconut oil consumption and cardiovascular risk factors in humans | journal= [[Nutrition Reviews]] | volume=74 | issue=4 | pages=267–280 | year=2016 | url=https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/nutrit/nuw002 | doi= 10.1093/nutrit/nuw002 | pmc= 4892314 | pmid = 26946252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other [[fatty acid]]s, lauric acid is inexpensive, has a long shelf-life, is nontoxic, and is safe to handle. It is used mainly for the production of [[soap]]s and [[cosmetics]].  For these purposes, lauric acid is reacted with [[sodium hydroxide]] to give [[sodium laurate]], which is a [[soap]].  Most commonly, sodium laurate is obtained by [[saponification]] of various oils, such as coconut oil.  These precursors give mixtures of sodium laurate and other soaps.&lt;ref name="Ullmann" /&gt;

===Niche uses===
In the laboratory, lauric acid may be used to investigate the [[molar mass]] of an unknown substance via the [[freezing-point depression]]. The choice of lauric acid is convenient because the melting point of the pure compound is relatively high (43.8°C). Its [[cryoscopic constant]] is 3.9°C·kg/mol. By melting lauric acid with the unknown substance, allowing it to cool, and recording the temperature at which the mixture freezes, the molar mass of the unknown compound may be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eee.uci.edu/programs/gchem/02MANfrzptdep.pdf |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523055404/https://eee.uci.edu/programs/gchem/02MANfrzptdep.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-05-23 |publisher=[[University of California, Irvine]] |title=Using Freezing Point Depression to find Molecular Weight |date=2010-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential medicinal properties===
''[[In vitro]]'' experiments have suggested that some fatty acids including lauric acid could be a useful component in a treatment for [[acne]], but no clinical trials have yet been conducted to evaluate this potential benefit in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakatsuji|first1=T|last2=Kao|first2=MC|last3=Fang|first3=JY|last4=Zouboulis|first4=CC|last5=Zhang|first5=L|last6=Gallo|first6=RL|last7=Huang|first7=CM|title=Antimicrobial Property of Lauric Acid Against Propionibacterium acnes: Its Therapeutic Potential for Inflammatory Acne Vulgaris|journal=The Journal of Investigative Dermatology|volume=129|issue=10|pages=2480–8|year=2009|pmid=19387482|pmc=2772209|doi=10.1038/jid.2009.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Yang|first1 = D|last2 = Pornpattananangkul|first2 = D|last3 = Nakatsuji|first3 = T|last4 = Chan|first4 = M|last5 = Carson|first5 = D|last6 = Huang|first6 = CM|last7 = Zhang|first7 = L|title = The Antimicrobial Activity of Liposomal Lauric Acids Against Propionibacterium acnes|journal = Biomaterials|volume = 30|issue = 30|pages = 6035–40|year = 2009|pmid = 19665786|pmc = 2735618|doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.07.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauric acid increases total serum [[cholesterol]] more than many other fatty acids, but most of the increase is attributable to an increase in [[high-density lipoprotein|high-density lipoprotein (HDL)]] (the "good" blood cholesterol). As a result, lauric acid has been characterized as having "a more favorable effect on total HDL cholesterol than any other fatty acid [examined], either saturated or unsaturated".&lt;ref name=Mensink2003&gt;{{cite journal | title = Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials | url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/77/5/1146.full?ijkey=846a72387ebc0d82545acd5442a0c3a9e9fc3566 | journal =American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |vauthors=Mensink RP, Zock PL, Kester AD, Katan MB | volume=77 | issue=5  | pages = 1146–1155 |date=May 2003 | issn = 0002-9165 | pmid = 12716665}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a lower total/HDL serum cholesterol ratio correlates with a decrease in atherosclerotic risk.&lt;ref name=Thijssen&gt;Thijssen, M.A. and R.P.

''Atherosclerosis: Diet and Drugs''. Springer. pp. 171–172. {{ISBN|978-3-540-22569-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, an extensive meta-analysis on foods affecting the total [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] /serum cholesterol ratio found in 2003 that the net effects of lauric acid on coronary artery disease outcomes remained uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/77/5/1146.full?ijkey=846a72387ebc0d82545acd5442a0c3a9e9fc3566 Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 review of coconut oil (which is nearly half lauric acid) was similarly inconclusive about the effects on [[cardiovascular disease]] risk.&lt;ref name="pmid26946252" /&gt;

[[File:Rastrelliger kanagurta JNC2855.JPG|thumb|The Indian mackerel, ''[[Rastrelliger kanagurta]]'', an example of Lessepsian migrant]]
Most Lessepsian migrations are of [[Red Sea]] species invading the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; few occur in the opposite direction.

This is a list of '''data breaches''',  using data compiled from various sources, including press reports, government news releases and mainstream news articles. The list includes those involving the theft or compromise of 30,000 or more records, although many more smaller breaches occur continually. Breaches of large organizations where the number of records is still unknown are also listed. The various methods used in the breaches are also listed, with [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] being the most common.

Most breaches occur in North America. It is estimated that the average cost of a data breach will be over $150 million by 2020, with the global annual cost forecast to be $2.1 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cuna.org/articles/105948-data-breach-costs-will-soar-to-2t-juniper "Data breach costs will soar to $2T: Juniper"], CUNA, May 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.experian.com/assets/data-breach/white-papers/2015-industry-forecast-experian.pdf "Data Breach Industry Forecast"], ''[[Experian]]'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that in first half of 2018 alone, about 4.5 billion records were exposed as a result of data breaches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thecitizenng.com/analysis-data-breaches-compromised-4-5bn-records-in-half-year-2018-gemalto/ "Data breaches compromised 4.5bn records in half year 2018 – Gemalto"], [https://thecitizenng.com The Citizen], October 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Maralinga: Australia’s Nuclear Waste Cover-up'''''  is a book by [[Alan Parkinson (engineer)|Alan Parkinson]] about the clean-up of the [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|British atomic bomb test site at Maralinga]] in [[South Australia]], published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/ockhamsrazor/stories/2007/2019647.htm Maralinga - Australia's nuclear waste cover-up]&lt;/ref&gt; Parkinson, a nuclear engineer, explains that the clean-up of Maralinga in the late 1990s was compromised by [[cost reduction|cost-cutting]] and simply involved dumping hazardous radioactive debris in shallow holes in the ground.  Parkinson states that "What was done at Maralinga was a cheap and nasty solution that wouldn't be adopted on white-fellas land."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/perspective/stories/2008/2153906.htm Nuclear waste and indigenous rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/38547  Maralinga's nuclear nightmare continues]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Failure theory''' is the science of predicting the conditions under which solid materials fail under the action of external loads. The failure of a material is usually classified into brittle failure ([[fracture]]) or ductile failure ([[yield (engineering)|yield]]).  Depending on the conditions (such as temperature, state of stress, loading rate) most materials can fail in a brittle or ductile manner or both.  However, for most practical situations, a material may be classified as either brittle or ductile. Though failure theory has been in development for over 200 years, its level of acceptability is yet to reach that of continuum mechanics.

In mathematical terms, failure theory is expressed in the form of various failure criteria which are valid for specific materials.  Failure criteria are functions in stress or strain space which separate "failed" states from "unfailed" states.  A precise physical definition of a "failed" state is not easily quantified and several working definitions are in use in the engineering community.  Quite often, phenomenological failure criteria of the same form are used to predict brittle failure and ductile yield.

== Material failure ==
In [[materials science]], '''material failure''' is the loss of load carrying capacity of a material unit. This definition introduces to the fact that material failure can be examined in different scales, from [[microscopic]], to [[macroscopic]]. In structural problems, where the structural response may be beyond the initiation of nonlinear material behaviour, material failure is of profound importance for the determination of the integrity of the structure. On the other hand, due to the lack of globally accepted [[fracture]] criteria, the determination of the structure's damage, due to material failure, is still under intensive research.

== Types of material failure ==
Material failure can be distinguished in two broader categories depending on the scale in which the material is examined:

=== Microscopic failure ===
Microscopic material failure is defined in terms of crack propagation and initiation. Such methodologies are useful for gaining insight in the cracking of specimens and simple structures under well defined global load distributions. Microscopic failure considers the initiation and propagation of a crack. Failure criteria in this case are related to microscopic fracture. Some of the most popular failure models in this area are the micromechanical failure models, which combine the advantages of [[continuum mechanics]] and classical [[fracture mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Besson J., Steglich D., Brocks W. (2003), Modelling of plain strain ductile rupture, ''International Journal of Plasticity'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Such models are based on the concept that during [[plastic deformation]], microvoids nucleate and grow until a local plastic neck or fracture of the intervoid matrix occurs, which causes the coalescence of neighbouring voids. Such a model, proposed by Gurson and extended by Tvergaard and [[Alan Needleman|Needleman]], is known as GTN. Another approach, proposed by Rousselier, is based on continuum [[damage mechanics]] (CDM) and [[thermodynamics]]. Both models form a modification of the von Mises yield potential by introducing a scalar damage quantity, which represents the void volume fraction of cavities, the porosity ''f''.

=== Macroscopic failure ===
Macroscopic material failure is defined in terms of load carrying capacity or energy storage capacity, equivalently. Li&lt;ref&gt;Li, Q.M. (2001), Strain energy density failure criterion, ''International Journal of Solids and Structures'' '''38''', pp. 6997–7013.&lt;/ref&gt; presents a classification of macroscopic failure criteria in four categories:
* Stress or strain failure
* Energy type failure (S-criterion, [[T-criterion]])
* Damage failure
* Empirical failure

Five general levels are considered, at which the meaning of deformation and failure is interpreted differently: the structural element scale, the macroscopic scale where macroscopic stress and strain are defined, the mesoscale which is represented by a typical void, the microscale and the atomic scale. The material behavior at one level is considered as a collective of its behavior at a sub-level. An efficient deformation and failure model should be consistent at every level.

== Brittle material failure criteria ==
Failure of brittle materials can be determined using several approaches:
* Phenomenological failure criteria
* Linear elastic [[fracture mechanics]]
* Elastic-plastic fracture mechanics
* Energy-based methods
* [[Cohesive zone model|Cohesive zone methods]]

=== Phenomenological failure criteria ===
The failure criteria that were developed for brittle solids were the maximum [[stress (mechanics)|stress]]/[[finite strain theory|strain]] criteria.  The '''maximum stress criterion''' assumes that a material fails when the maximum [[principal stress]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; in a material element exceeds the uniaxial tensile strength of the material.  Alternatively, the material will fail if the minimum principal stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; is less than the uniaxial compressive strength of the material.  If the uniaxial tensile strength of the material is &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt; and the uniaxial compressive strength is &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c&lt;/math&gt;, then the safe region for the material is assumed to be
:&lt;math&gt;
    \sigma_c &lt; \sigma_3 &lt; \sigma_1 &lt; \sigma_t \,
 &lt;/math&gt;
Note that the convention that tension is positive has been used in the above expression.

The '''maximum strain criterion''' has a similar form except that the principal strains are compared with experimentally determined uniaxial strains at failure, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
    \varepsilon_c &lt; \varepsilon_3 &lt; \varepsilon_1 &lt; \varepsilon_t \,
 &lt;/math&gt;
The maximum principal stress and strain criteria continue to be widely used in spite of severe shortcomings.

Numerous other phenomenological failure criteria can be found in the engineering literature.  The degree of success of these criteria in predicting failure has been limited.  For brittle materials, some popular failure criteria are:
* criteria based on invariants of the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]
* the [[Tresca yield criterion|Tresca or maximum shear stress]] failure criterion
* the [[von Mises yield criterion|von Mises]] or maximum elastic distortional energy criterion
* the [[Mohr-Coulomb theory|Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion]] for cohesive-frictional solids
* the [[Drucker Prager|Drucker-Prager failure criterion]] for pressure-dependent solids
* the [[Bresler Pister yield criterion|Bresler-Pister failure criterion]] for concrete
* the [[Willam-Warnke yield criterion|Willam-Warnke failure criterion]] for concrete
* the [[Hankinson's equation|Hankinson criterion]], an empirical failure criterion that is used for orthotropic materials such as wood
* the [[Hill yield criteria]] for anisotropic solids
* the [[Tsai-Wu failure criterion]] for anisotropic composites
* the [[Johnson–Holmquist damage model]] for high-rate deformations of isotropic solids
* the [[Hoek-Brown failure criterion]] for rock masses
* the [[Critical state soil mechanics|Cam-Clay failure theory]] for soils

=== Linear elastic fracture mechanics ===
{{main|Fracture mechanics}}
The approach taken in [[fracture mechanics|linear elastic fracture mechanics]] is to estimate the amount of energy needed to grow a preexisting crack in a brittle material.  The earliest [[fracture mechanics]] approach for unstable crack growth is Griffiths' theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k560264/f178.table  Griffiths,A.A. 1920. The theory of rupture and flow in solids. Phil.Trans.Roy.Soc.Lond. A221, 163.]&lt;/ref&gt;  When applied to the [[fracture mechanics|mode I]] opening of a crack, Griffiths' theory predicts that the critical stress (&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) needed to propagate the crack is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma = \sqrt{\cfrac{2 E \gamma}{\pi a}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the Young's modulus of the material, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the surface energy per unit area of the crack, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the crack length for edge cracks or &lt;math&gt;2a&lt;/math&gt; is the crack length for plane cracks.  The quantity &lt;math&gt;\sigma\sqrt{\pi a}&lt;/math&gt; is postulated as a material parameter called the '''fracture toughness'''.  The mode I [[fracture toughness]] for [[plane strain]] is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   K_{\rm Ic} = Y\sigma_c\sqrt{\pi a} 
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_c&lt;/math&gt; is a critical value of the far field stress and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless factor that depends on the geometry, material properties, and loading condition.  The quantity &lt;math&gt;K_{\rm Ic}&lt;/math&gt; is related to the [[stress intensity factor]] and is determined experimentally.  Similar quantities &lt;math&gt;K_{\rm IIc}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_{\rm IIIc}&lt;/math&gt; can be determined for [[fracture mechanics|mode II]] and [[fracture mechanics|model III]] loading conditions.

The state of stress around cracks of various shapes can be expressed in terms of their [[stress intensity factor]]s.  Linear elastic fracture mechanics predicts that a crack will extend when the stress intensity factor at the crack tip is greater than the fracture toughness of the material.  Therefore, the critical applied stress can also be determined once the stress intensity factor at a crack tip is known.

=== Energy-based methods ===
{{Main|Fracture mechanics}}

The linear elastic fracture mechanics method is difficult to apply for anisotropic materials (such as [[Composite material|composites]]) or for situations where the loading or the geometry are complex.  The [[strain energy release rate]] approach has proved quite useful for such situations.  The strain energy release rate for a mode I crack which runs through the thickness of a plate is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   G_I = \cfrac{P}{2t}~\cfrac{du}{da}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the applied load, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of the plate, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement at the point of application of the load due to crack growth, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the crack length for edge cracks or &lt;math&gt;2a&lt;/math&gt; is the crack length for plane cracks.  The crack is expected to propagate when the strain energy release rate exceeds a critical value &lt;math&gt;G_{\rm Ic}&lt;/math&gt; - called the '''critical strain energy release rate'''.

The [[fracture toughness]] and the critical strain energy release rate for [[plane stress]] are related by
:&lt;math&gt;
   G_{\rm Ic} = \cfrac{1}{E}~K_{\rm Ic}^2 
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the Young's modulus.  If an initial crack size is known, then a critical stress can be determined using the strain energy release rate criterion.

== Ductile material failure criteria ==
{{Main|Yield (engineering)}}
Criteria used to predict the failure of ductile materials are usually called [[yield (engineering)|yield]] criteria.  Commonly used failure criteria for ductile materials are:
* the [[Yield surface|Tresca]] or maximum shear stress criterion
* the [[von Mises yield criterion]] or distortional strain energy density criterion
* the [[Gurson yield criterion]] for pressure-dependent metals
* the [[Hosford yield criterion]] for metals
* the [[Hill yield criteria]]
* various criteria based on the invariants of the Cauchy stress tensor

The [[yield surface]] of a ductile material usually changes as the material experiences increased [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]].  Models for the evolution of the yield surface with increasing strain, temperature, and strain rate are used in conjunction with the above failure criteria for [[isotropic hardening plasticity|isotropic hardening]], [[kinematic hardening plasticity|kinematic hardening]], and [[viscoplasticity]].  Some such models are:
* the [[Johnson-Cook plasticity model|Johnson-Cook model]]
* the [[Steinberg-Guinan plasticity model|Steinberg-Guinan model]]
* the [[Zerilli-Armstrong plasticity model|Zerilli-Armstrong model]]
* the [[Mechanical threshold stress plasticity model|Mechanical threshold stress model]]
* the [[Preston-Tonks-Wallace plasticity model|Preston-Tonks-Wallace model]]

There is another important aspect to ductile materials - the prediction of the [[tensile strength|ultimate failure strength]] of a ductile material.  Several models for predicting the ultimate strength have been used by the engineering community with varying levels of success.  For metals, such failure criteria are usually expressed in terms of a combination of porosity and strain to failure or in terms of a [[damage (mechanics)|damage]] parameter.

'''Parvez Butt''' (or '''Pervez Butt''') (born 4 October 1942) is a Pakistani [[nuclear engineer]] and the former chairman of the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC) from 2001 to 2006. A nuclear engineer by profession, Parvez Butt played an important role in the development of the [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|Pakistan's nuclear power]] and [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|weapons program]]. As chairman of PAEC, Parvez Butt helped establishing the [[particle accelerator]]s, [[nuclear power plant]]s, and started the research program to the field of [[Nuclear medicine in Pakistan|Nuclear medicines]]. Parvez Butt is currently serving as an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the [[Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences]], and also serving as a "''Science and Technology''" member at the [[Planning Commission (Pakistan)|Planning Commission]] of Pakistan.

== Education ==

Born in [[Gujranwala]], Punjab, Pakistan. At age 16, Butt was admitted to University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, with a full engineering scholarship. In 1962, Butt graduated and received his BS in Mechanical engineering from [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore|University of Engineering and Technology]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9OfEGifzPrQJ:www.competitiveness.org.pk/BoD/pervezbutt.pdf+Parvez+Butt+PAEC&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh-eCA4x1DQnRkZtiOzDxb2v7ZQlUpRprYq_8Y04-_syxHEIG-YexVv-A4jJK-Enot3A01yygtLnMgfX8DP3UIxn8NiGZ0KjfpsNv1z2ctA_e0jIRp2DwVPCS8IVwT2cADlPtkR&amp;sig=AHIEtbRYkMdxCl8kvwnfJnf-yldFoMqXBg|title=CV of Parvez Butt|last=Unknown|first=|authorlink=|date=|website=|publisher=|format=|doi=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106080007/https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache%3A9OfEGifzPrQJ%3Awww.competitiveness.org.pk%2FBoD%2Fpervezbutt.pdf+Parvez+Butt+PAEC&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh-eCA4x1DQnRkZtiOzDxb2v7ZQlUpRprYq_8Y04-_syxHEIG-YexVv-A4jJK-Enot3A01yygtLnMgfX8DP3UIxn8NiGZ0KjfpsNv1z2ctA_e0jIRp2DwVPCS8IVwT2cADlPtkR&amp;sig=AHIEtbRYkMdxCl8kvwnfJnf-yldFoMqXBg|archivedate=6 November 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=1 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}
{{Self-published source|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his graduation, Butt was employed in Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), and joined PAEC-Lahore Center, where he did his post-graduate research at Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. Butt was awarded the PAEC scholarship in 1964 by the PAEC chairman Dr. [[I. H. Usmani]], and fled to Canada on the advice of Dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]]. He was enrolled in Engineering School of the [[University of Toronto]], where he completed and received his MS in nuclear engineering from the University of Toronto in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pc.gov.pk/Member%20Energy_profile.htm|title=Parvez Butt (PC Member of Energy)|last=(PCP)|first=Planning Commission of Pakistan|authorlink=Planning Commission (Pakistan)|author2=Jawaid Azfar|date=|website=Planning Commission|publisher=Computer Center of Planning Commission|doi=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504134801/http://www.pc.gov.pk/Member%20Energy_profile.htm|archivedate=4 May 2010|deadurl=bot: unknown|accessdate=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission==

Pervez Butt joined the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission in 1963 as "''Principal Engineer''" (PE), and following his master's degree, he was upgraded to become a ''Chief Engineer'' (CE) in 1966. Butt was part of the Pakistani delegation that led to a successful agreement with [[General Electric]] to supply country's first [[CANDU reactor|CANDU]] type-[[nuclear reactor]], under the name of [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant]] (KANUPP). Butt was involved in the project's design, installation, operation and maintenance since very beginning of the project. From 1965 to 1970, he worked in the design office of Canadian General Electric, [[Peterborough, Ontario]]. Canada.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1971, after the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 war]], Butt came back to Pakistan and re-joined PAEC. The PAEC, under [[Munir Ahmed Khan]], began to developed nuclear weapons by the prime minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], Parvez Butt was made part of the nuclear weapons design and manufacture program with the full backing of Munir Ahmad Khan. He was also a part of the PAEC team that was mandated to buy and purchase equipment and machinery from abroad. In 1974, Butt was transferred to the [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology]] (PINSTECH), where he was made [[director-general]] of "''Nuclear Engineering Division''" (NED). NED, along with NPD (Nuclear Physics Division), developed the first nuclear device, codename "HMX-3". In 1974, Parvez Butt was part of the PAEC team that had indigenously designed built the [[Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor#PARR-II Reactor|PARR-II Reactor]]. While the project was led by Munir Ahmad Khan and [[Muhammad Hafeez Qureshi|Hafeez Qureshi]], Butt took part in designing of the reactor. In 1975, Munir Ahmad Khan assigned another project to Parvez Butt. In 1975, Parvez Butt was the head of the team that was responsible for producing the first [[Uranium hexafluoride|UF]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Pervez Butt also played an important role in designing [[neutron]] [[particle accelerator]] at PARR-II. He had worked closely with well-known Pakistani [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] scientist Dr. [[Samar Mubarakmand]] in establishing a neutron particle accelerator. He worked closely with his mentor and former PAEC chairman, [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] in building [[nuclear power plant]]s.

To develop indigenous capability, Butt was assigned the responsibility for the establishment of large infrastructure organisation, consisting of design and development and testing facilities and large manufacturing workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/sym/2003/buttbio.htm|title=Biography of Parvez Butt|last=(WNA)|first=World Nuclear Association|authorlink=World Nuclear Association|date=|year=2003|website=WNA|publisher=World Nuclear Ass.|doi=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=1 May 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The national industrial training centres for welding ([[Pakistan Welding Institute]]) and non-destructive testing (NCNDT), to ensure high quality production, are among other organisations established by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

He also designed the [[Chashma Nuclear Power Plant]]. He was appointed director of the PAEC, in 1984 and chairman of PAEC in 2001. On 26 July, as new Chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, he established five more [[nuclear medicine]]s centres in the country and trained the staff of other health institutions in nuclear medicines and methods.

During his tenure of 5 years as chairman, he successfully took actions to accelerate the growth in various areas of activities in which PAEC is involved and created many new organisations. These included research organisations in agriculture, establishing more nuclear medical centres, expansion in nuclear power generation, search and mining of [[uranium]], industrialisation, self-reliance, human resource development etc.

===Nuclear energy program===
Butt was actively involved in Pakistan's civilian [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|nuclear program]]. He, along with other Pakistani nuclear scientists, visited People's Republic of China in 1986 to lead a Civilian Nuclear Technology agreement between Pakistan and People's Republic of China. He was actively involved in the technical and contractual negotiations for the Chinese [[nuclear power plant]]s and as chairman PAEC signed the contract for the second unit in 2004.

=== Nuclear hazard issue ===

Parvez Butt as PAEC chairman faced an important [[environmental issue]] at [[Baghalchur]], a former uranium exploration site, which was used in 1978 to 2000. The site was closed in 2000. In an interview with [[BBC]], Butt has stated: "''It is being done in keeping with the international standards for storing nuclear waste''". PAEC chairman was summoned by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] on the nuclear waste issue in which he gave assurance to supreme court of Pakistan that the radioactive and nuclear waste material has been taken care under the international standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ==
Pervez Butt headed PAEC at [[IAEA]] meeting where he, as a chairman of PAEC, signed a contract with IAEA. On 3 September 2004, [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) has mandated Pakistan to extensively use [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] for civilian purposes in agriculture, industrial, health, education and environment sectors. IAEA had decided to offer substantial funding for 24 research projects, findings of which would be shared with other Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan had become the "highest recipient of IAEA's financial and technical assistance" and that the relevant international agencies and Islamabad's bilateral supporters had been taken into confidence about the application of nuclear energy for civilian purposes. Mr. Parvez Butt also said the IAEA had allowed the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission to amply use nuclear energy for improving the performance of agriculture, industrial, health, education and environment sectors.

Butt was very close to then-[[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], [[Shaukat Aziz]]. Parvez Butt maintained a close association with Prime Minister Aziz until Butt's term to be completed. Parvez Butt submitted a long-term [[nuclear power plant]] project to Prime Minister Aziz, who allowed PAEC to established more both civilian and military purpose nuclear power plants.  Butt also assisted Prime Minister Aziz to launch work on the 325-megawatt plant in Chashma, which is the second to be built at the site with Chinese help.

On 28 December 2005, Prime Minister Aziz inaugurated Chasma nuclear power plant, where both Chinese and Pakistani nuclear scientists attended. In an inauguration, Aziz said "a milestone" in the history of [[nuclear technology]] in Pakistan.

== Fame and legacy ==

He has been awarded Pakistan's highest civil awards [[Hilal-e-Imtiaz]] and [[Sitara-e-Imtiaz]] in 1999 from the [[President of Pakistan]], Justice (r). [[Muhammad Rafiq Tarar]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Pervez Butt has been an active member of the Board of Government of [[World Association of Nuclear Operators]] (WANO), [[World Nuclear Association]] (WNA) and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA). He was elected the Vice Chair of the [[IAEA]] Board of Government in 2005.

On 4 July 2006, Parvez Butt retired from PAEC as a Chief Scientist. Dr. [[Anwar Ali (scientist)|Anwar Ali]], a known [[nuclear physicist]] and his fellow nuclear engineer, took over as Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission in a simple ceremony held at PAEC headquarters. He was later transferred to [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|Ministry of Science and Technology]] where he was elevated as the Science and Technology secretary. He is also serving as a member of [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|Higher Education Commission]].

Pervez Butt was a distinguished associate and team member of late Pakistani nuclear engineer [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] and also worked under Dr. [[I. H. Usmani]] and Dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]]. Like his [[mentors]], he kept a lower profile. That is why he is also considered{{by whom|date=September 2011}} as the "''Unsung Hero of Nuclear Pakistan''".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10880">Baron '''Peter von Bilderling''' (born in St Peterburg May 26, 1844 – died in Zapolie September 25, 1900&lt;ref name="rosamondpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosamondpress.com/2013/11/12/peter-von-bilderling-oil-baron/ |title=Peter von Bilderling &amp;#8211; Oil Baron &amp;#124; rosamondpress |&lt;!--########## Peter von Bilderling – Oil Baron #########--&gt; |publisher=rosamondpress.com|accessdate=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was an engineer and an officer in the Engineering Corps of the [[Imperial Russian Army]].

He was a [[humanism|humanist]] known for his writings, notably his book on the military horse, and his reorganisation of the [[Ijevsk]] arms factory, the manufacture of Berdanka [[carbine]]s, and the creation of the no 4 line carbine. He founded the Tsaritsin [[Oil refinery|refinery]] with [[Robert Nobel]] and the [[Branobel]] oil company in [[Baku]] with [[Ludwig Nobel]]. Finally, he established an agricultural and meteorological station in Zapolie, where he invented the roséomètre, an instrument for measuring the [[dew point]]. He was the brother of Baron [[Alexandr von Bilderling|Alexandre von Bilderling]], the general who participated in the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

== Biography ==
Peter von Bilderling was born to a noble [[Baltic German]] family from the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]]. His father, Alexandre Otto Hermann Grigoriévitch von Bilderling, was a lieutenant-general in the Engineering Corps. His grandfather, Georges Sigismond von Bilterlings, (1767–1829), was a Lutheran pastor in [[Mitau]], Courland, today known as [[Jelgava]], [[Lettonie|Latvia]]. He was a professor, theologian, philosopher and writer. His mother came from an untitled family of the Polish nobility, the Doliwo-Dobrowolski.

Peter von Bilderling was born in [[Saint Petersburg]] on May 26, 1844, and died the 25th of September 1900 at his Zapolie property near Louga, where he is buried. He left the Corps of Pages as a major with honors in 1861, then the Michel artillery academy in the first rank. He was attached to the [[Uhlan]] regiment of the guards of the [[Grand Duke Nicholas]]. He was an [[aide de camp]] to General Kartzof in the [[Caucasus]]. In 1870, he was sent on a mission by the Imperial government to Great Britain and the United States to study gun manufacture.

He married twice:
* Sofia Vladimirovna Westmann 1853–1914
* Natalia Alexandrovna Barantzov 1885–1981. Her descendants now live on the [[Côte d'Azur]] in Cannes and Nice.

== Ijevsk weapons factory ==
With an imperial government lease, he and Baron Standertskjöld, directed and reorganised the [[Ijevsk]] weapons factory from 1871 to l879 to require only domestic [[raw material]]s. In 1872, he signed an agreement with [[Ludvig Nobel]], who furnished the [[machine tool]]s. Under his direction, more than 400,000 [[Berdan rifle|Berdanka]] guns were produced. He created the #4 line carbine. A telegraph office opened at the factory. The factory was re-supplied by rail. It was during these years (with production starting of the [[Berdan rifle]]) that the [[division of labour]] and [[machine tool]] production of gun mechanism components came into its own. The [[Kalashnikov rifle|Kalashnikov]] was invented and manufactured at Ijevsk. The carbine #4 underwent a baptism of fire during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turk War]]. Von Bilderling personally visited the front to evaluate of the effectiveness of this weapon. He was later awarded the right to bear the arms of [[Saint George#Arms and flag|St George]] for his actions on the [[Danube]]. Wounded in the leg and head, he joined the reserve corps in September 1880.

== BRANOBEL, Baku oil company ==
Instead of using his time and the assets of his mission to find raw materials for the Ijevsk factory, in 1876 [[Robert Nobel]] used the 25,000 rubles he had to buy an oil refinery in Tsaritsyne, now known as [[Volgograd]]. He saw the [[Oil refinery|refinery]] as an investment with a great future.

A total of 450,000 rubles were invested in BRANOBEL. Peter von Bilderling put in 300,000 and Baron Standertskjöld 150,000. The business began to show a profit.

[[Ludwig Nobel]] convinced his older brother Robert in May 1879 to set up a company, the ''"Tovarichtchestvo Nephtanavo Proïsvodtsva Bratiev Nobel"'' (Nobel Brothers Oil Production Company), named BRANOBEL in telegraph communications, and soon, simply NOBEL. Peter von Bilderling remained president of its administrative council until he died in 1900. The [[Share capital|capital]] of the business founded in St Petersburg (3&amp;nbsp;million rubles in 600 shares of 5000 rubles each) was held as follows:
*Ludwig Nobel...........................1 610 000
*Baron Peter von Bilderling........930 000
*Alfred Nobel..........................115 000
*Robert Nobel...........................100 000
*I.J. Zabelsky..........................135 000
*Baron Alexandre von Bilderling.....50 000
*Fritz Blumberg..........................25 000
*Michel Beliamin.........................25 000
*A.S. Sundgren............................5 000
*Benno Wunderlich.........................5 000

This 3-million-ruble [[capitalization]] was followed by another million rubles en 1880, 2&amp;nbsp;million and 4&amp;nbsp;million in 1881 and finally 5&amp;nbsp;million en 1884 (in 250-rubles shares to allow investors to multiply). BRANOBEL was, at the end of the 19th century, one of the biggest oil companies in the world. [[Pipeline transport|Pipeline]] technology for oil transportation was perfected near [[Baku]] by [[Vladimir Shukhov]] and Branobel in the years 1878–1880.

Of the money bequeathed by Alfred Nobel to establish the [[Nobel Prize]], 12% came from his shares in BRANOBEL. At that point he was its biggest individual investor. [[Bolsheviks]] took Baku on April 28, 1920, and nationalized BRANOBEL.

== Agriculture, meteorology in Zapolie ==
Around 1881, after much searching in [[Courland]], he bought from a property from General [[Borivoje Mirković]], a property of 400 mas de Zapolie et de 490 mas de Boussany (Luga District, Saint-Petersburg). In 1889, he organised and became very interested in the model agricultural station in Zapolie with a special meteorology station, reputed even abroad. After completely organizing the work, he turned these stations over to the minister of agriculture.

== Family ==
[[File:Armes Buldring Bilderling Klingspor 1882.JPG|thumb|Armes Buldring Bilderling]]
Peter von Bilderling's family was originally from [[Westphalia]]. In 1350 Otbert Boldring owned the [[fief]]s of Cotwik and Overdik in [[Raalte]] [[parish]] and were notable members of the [[Hanseatic League]]. One branch of the family came from the Baltic countries with Johan Buldrink, in Courland, who became the vassal of the [[Teutonic Order]] when he received a fief&lt;ref name="herder-institut"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; (noblesse immémoriale). The branch of Peter von Bilderling came through [[Livonia with Friedrich, grandson of Johan, and the fiefs of Karrinem and Taifer, then Lithuania with Johan then Melchior and the fief of Miszany. The family's title of baron was recognized in the Russian ''Nobiliaire'' through an edict of the Imperial Senate in 1903.

The family arms are: ''D'argent à une aigle de sable, languée de gueules, la poitrine d'argent bearing a green poplar.'' Cimier un peuplier arraché de sinople entre un vol de sable à dextre et d'argent à sénestre. Sable [[lambrequin]]s doublé d'argent.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Arvid von Klingspor : Baltisches Wappenbuch.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poplar is a reference to the original name, Boldring. (Bolder meant poplar in Old German. [[dictionnaire de Grimm]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12764">A '''photobioreactor''' is a [[bioreactor]] that utilizes a light source to cultivate [[phototroph]]ic microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oilgae.com/ref/glos/photobioreactor.html |title=Photobioreactor - Definition, Glossary, Details - Oilgae |work=Glossary |publisher=Oilgae |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organisms use [[photosynthesis]] to generate biomass from light and carbon dioxide and include plants, [[moss]]es, macroalgae, [[microalgae]], [[cyanobacteria]] and [[purple bacteria]]. Within the artificial environment of a photobioreactor, specific conditions are carefully controlled for respective species. Thus, a photobioreactor allows much higher growth rates and purity levels than anywhere in nature or habitats similar to nature. Hypothetically, phototropic biomass could be derived from nutrient-rich wastewater and [[flue gas]] carbon dioxide in a photobioreactor.

[[image:Microalgenkwekerij te Heure bij Borculo.jpg|thumb|Open [[raceway pond]]]]

==Open systems==
The first approach for the controlled production of phototrophic organisms was and still is a natural [[open pond]] or artificial [[raceway pond]]. Therein, the culture suspension, which contains all necessary nutrients and carbon dioxide, is pumped around in a cycle, being directly illuminated from sunlight via the liquid’s surface. This construction principle is the simplest way of production for phototrophic organisms. But due to their depth (up to 0.3 m) and the related reduced average light supply, open systems only reach limited areal productivity rates. In addition, the consumption of energy is relatively high, as high amounts of water containing low product concentration have to be processed.  Open space is expensive in areas with a dense population, while water is rare in others. Using open technologies causes high losses of water due to evaporation into the atmosphere.

==Closed systems==
Since the 1950s several approaches have been conducted to develop closed systems, which theoretically provide higher cell densities of phototrophic organisms and therefore a lower demand of water to be pumped than open systems. In addition, closed construction avoids system-related water losses and the risk of contamination through landing water birds or dust is minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Up To Speed On: Algae Biofuels|author = Lane. G.|year = 2013|volume = 1|publisher = Smashwords|isbn = 9781301351961|pages = 1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All modern photobioreactors have tried to balance between a thin layer of culture suspension, optimized light application, low pumping energy consumption, [[capital expenditure]] and microbial purity. Many different systems have been tested, but only a few approaches were able to perform at an industrial scale.&lt;ref&gt;Submariner Project: [http://www.submariner-project.eu/images/stories/events/algae-trelleborg/presentations/wencker.pdf Photobioreactor design principles]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redesigned laboratory fermenters===
The simplest approach is the redesign of the well-known glass [[fermenter]]s, which are state of the art in many biotechnological research and production facilities worldwide. The moss reactor for example shows a standard glass vessel, which is externally supplied with light. The existing head nozzles are used for sensor installation and for gas exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eva |last=Decker |author2=[[Ralf Reski]]  |year=2008 |title=Current achievements in the production of complex biopharmaceuticals with moss bioreactors |journal=Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=3–9 |pmid=17701058 |doi=10.1007/s00449-007-0151-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type is quite common in laboratory scale, but it has never been established in bigger scale, due to its limited vessel size.

===Tubular photobioreactors===
[[image:Photobioreactor PBR 4000 G IGV Biotech.jpg|thumb|Tubular glass photobioreactor]]
Made from glass or plastic tubes, this photobioreactor type has succeeded within production scale. The tubes are oriented horizontally or vertically and are supplied from a central utilities installation with pump, sensors, nutrients and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Tubular photobioreactors are established worldwide from laboratory up to production scale, e.g. for the production of the [[carotenoid]] [[Astaxanthine]] from the green algae ''[[Haematococcus pluvialis]]'' or for the production of food supplement from the green algae ''[[Chlorella]] vulgaris''. These photobioreactors take advantage from the high purity levels and their efficient outputs. The biomass production can be done at a high quality level and the high biomass concentration at the end of the production allows energy efficient downstream processing. Due to the recent prices of the photobioreactors, economically feasible concepts today can only be found within high-value markets, e.g. food supplement or cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Photobioreactors: production systems for phototrophic microorganisms|author = Pulz. O.|year = 2001|volume = 57|issue = 3|pages = 287–293|doi=10.1007/s002530100702|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantages of tubular photobioreactors at production scale are also transferred to laboratory scale. A combination of the mentioned glass vessel with a thin tube coil allows relevant biomass production rates a laboratory research scale. Being controlled by a complex process control system the regulation of the environmental conditions reaches a high level.&lt;ref&gt;Algae Observer: [http://www.algaeobserver.com/igv-algae-screening-xcubio IGV Biotech Presents Novel Algae Screening System]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christmas tree photobioreactor===
[[image:20120927_Tannenbaumreaktor.jpg|thumb|Christmas tree reactor]]
An alternative approach is shown by a photobioreactor, which is built in a tapered geometry and which carries a helically attached, translucent double hose circuit system.&lt;ref&gt;F. Cotta, M. Matschke, J. Großmann, C. Griehl und S. Matthes; "Verfahrenstechnische Aspekte eines flexiblen, tubulären Systems zur Algenproduktion" (Process-related aspects of a flexible, tubular system for algae production); DECHEMA 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a layout similar to a Christmas tree. The tubular system is constructed in modules and can theoretically be scaled outdoors up to agricultural scale. A dedicated location is not crucial, similar to other closed systems, and therefore non-arable land is suitable as well. The material choice should prevent [[biofouling]] and ensure high final biomass concentrations. The combination of turbulence and the closed concept should allow a clean operation and a high operational availability.&lt;ref&gt;Großmann Ingenieur Consult GmbH: [http://www.gicon.de/news-and-jobs/aktuelles/nachrichtendetails/article/aufbau-eines-biosolarzentrums-in-koethen.html?tx_ttnews&amp;#x5B;backPid&amp;#x5D;=143&amp;cHash=8ed808ad8ed97c41db87cb397bd1a625 Aufbau eines Biosolarzentrums in Köthen], 6. März 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plate photobioreactor===
[[image:Photobioreactor PBR 500 P IGV Biotech.jpg|thumb|Plastic plate photobioreactor]]
Another development approach can be seen with the construction based on plastic or glass plates. Plates with different technical design are mounted to form a small layer of culture suspension, which provides an optimized light supply. In addition, the simpler construction compared to tubular reactors allows the use of less expensive plastic materials. From the pool of different concepts e.g. meandering flow designs or bottom gassed systems have been realized and shown good output results. Some unsolved issues are material life time stability or the biofilm forming. Applications at industrial scale are limited by the scalability of plate systems.&lt;ref name="Handbookof2013"&gt;{{cite book|title = Handbook of microalgal culture |edition=2nd |volume = 1|year = 2013|publisher = Blackwell Science Ltd|isbn = 978-0-470-67389-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, the IBA in Hamburg, Germany, a building with an integrated glass plate photobioreactor facade, was commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.art-magazin.de/architektur/60381/iba_hamburg_eroeffnung |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328065058/http://www.art-magazin.de/architektur/60381/iba_hamburg_eroeffnung |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-03-28 |first=Till |last=Briegleb |title=IBA Hamburg - Opening, Algaehouse, Worldquartier |work=Art Magazin |date=2013-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horizontal photobioreactor===
[[File:Horizontal-Photobioreaktor mit Zick-Zack-förmigen Vertiefungen.png|thumb|Horizontal photobioreactor with zigzag shaped geometry]]
This photobioreactor type consists of a plate-shaped basic geometry with peaks and valleys arranged in regular distance. This geometry causes the distribution of incident light over a larger surface which corresponds to a dilution effect. This also helps solving a basic problem in phototrophic cultivation, because most microalgae species react sensitively to high light intensities. Most microalgae experience light saturation already at light intensities, ranging substantially below the maximum daylight intensity of approximately 2000 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Simultaneously, a larger light quantity can be exploited in order to improve photoconversion efficiency. The mixing is accomplished by a rotary pump, which causes a cylindrical rotation of the culture broth. In contrast to vertical designs, horizontal reactors contain only thin layers of media with a correspondingly low hydrodynamic pressure. This has a positive impact on the necessary energy input and reduces material costs at the same time.

===Foil photobioreactor===
The pressure of market prices has led the development of foil-based photobioreactor types. Inexpensive [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] or [[Polyethylene|PE]] foils are mounted to form bags or vessels which cover algae suspensions and expose them to light. The pricing ranges of photobioreactor types have been enlarged with the foil systems. It has to be kept in mind, that these systems have a limited sustainability as the foils have to be replaced from time to time. For full balances, the investment for required support systems has to be calculated as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Algae for Biofuels and Energy |editor=Michael A. Borowitzka, Navid R. Moheimani |chapter=Chapter 7 Photobioreactors for Microalgae Biofuel Production |first=Graziella |last=Zittelli |author2=Liliana Rodolfi |author3=Niccolo Bassi |author4=Natascia Biondi |author5=Mario R. Tredici  |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=9789400754799 |pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Porous Substrate Bioreactor ===
[http://www.portal.uni-koeln.de/9015.html?&amp;L=1&amp;tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=4183&amp;tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&amp;tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&amp;cHash=616b87c691d49ab600fbac53d7134d0b Porous Substrate Bioreactor] (PSBR), being developed at University of Cologne, also known as the twin-layer system, uses a new principle to separate the algae from a nutrient solution by means of a porous reactor surface on which the microalgae are trapped in biofilms. This new procedure reduces by a factor of up to one hundred the amount of liquid needed for operation compared to the current technology, which cultivates algae in suspensions. As such, the PSBR procedure significantly reduces the energy needed while increasing the portfolio of algae that can be cultivated.

==Outlook==
The discussion around microalgae and their potentials in [[carbon dioxide]] sequestration and biofuel production has caused high pressure on developers and manufacturers of photobioreactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Commercial Applications of Microalgae| author = Spolaore. P.|year = 2006|journal = Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering|volume = 102| issue = 2|pages = 87–96|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1263/jbb.101.87|url = http://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/2771/1/joannis-cassan_2771.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, none of the mentioned systems is able to produce phototrophic microalgae biomass at a price which is able to compete with crude oil. New approaches test e.g. dripping methods to produce ultra-thin layers for maximal growth with application of flue gas and waste water. Further on, much research is done worldwide on genetically modified and optimized microalgae.

[[File:Principle of the photoelectrowetting effect.jpg|thumb|Principle of the photoelectrowetting effect]]
'''Photoelectrowetting''' is a modification of the [[wetting]] properties of a surface (typically a [[hydrophobic]] surface) using incident light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/srep/2011/111207/srep00184/full/srep00184.html S. Arscott, 'Moving liquids with light: Photoelectrowetting on semiconductors', ''Sci. Rep.'' '''1''', 184, (2011). Scientific Reports: Nature Publishing Group.]&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas ordinary [[electrowetting]] is observed in surfaces consisting of a [[liquid]]/[[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]]/[[Electrical conductor|conductor]] stack, photoelectrowetting can be observed by replacing the conductor with a [[semiconductor]] to form a liquid/insulator/semiconductor stack. This has electrical and optical properties similar to the metal/insulator/semiconductor stack used in [[metal-oxide-semiconductor]] field effect transistors ([[MOSFET]]s) and [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs). Replacing the conductor with a semiconductor results in asymmetrical electrowetting behavior (in terms of [[voltage]] polarity), depending on the semiconductor [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] type and density.

Incident light above the semiconductor's [[band gap]] creates photo-induced carriers via [[electron-hole pair]] generation in the [[depletion region]] of the underlying semiconductor. This leads to a modification of the [[capacitance]] of the insulator/semiconductor stack, resulting in a modification of the [[contact angle]] of a liquid droplet resting on the surface of the stack in a continuous way which can also be non-reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4905348|title=Electrowetting on semiconductors|first1=Cesar|last1=Palma|first2=Robert|last2=Deegan|date=5 January 2015|publisher=|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=106|issue=1|pages=014106|via=aip.scitation.org (Atypon)|doi=10.1063/1.4905348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photoelectrowetting effect can be interpreted by a modification of the [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]-[[Gabriel Lippmann|Lippmann]] [[Electrowetting#Electrowetting theory|equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C4RA04187A|title=Electrowetting and semiconductors|first=Steve|last=Arscott|date=3 July 2014|publisher=|journal=RSC Advances|volume=4|issue=55|doi=10.1039/c4ra04187a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure illustrates the principle of the photoelectrowetting effect. At zero bias (0V) the conducting droplet has a large contact angle (left image) if the insulator is [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]. As the bias is increased (positive for a [[extrinsic semiconductor|p-type]] semiconductor, negative for an [[extrinsic semiconductor|n-type]] semiconductor) the droplet spreads out – i.e. the contact angle decreases (middle image). In the presence of light (having an energy superior to the [[band gap]] of the semiconductor) the droplet spreads out more due to the reduction of the thickness of the [[space charge]] region at the insulator/semiconductor interface (right image).

==Optical actuation of MEMS==
Photo-actuation of [[Microelectromechanical systems|microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)]] has been demonstrated using photoelectrowetting.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4723569|title=Optical actuation of microelectromechanical systems using photoelectrowetting|first1=Matthieu|last1=Gaudet|first2=Steve|last2=Arscott|date=28 May 2012|publisher=|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=100|issue=22|pages=224103|via=aip.scitation.org (Atypon)|doi=10.1063/1.4723569}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2012-01-team-photoelectrowetting-circuit.html|title=Research team creates photoelectrowetting circuit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A micro[[cantilever]] is placed on top of the liquid-insulator-photoconductor junction.  As light is shined on the junction, the capillary force from the droplet on the cantilever, due to the contact angle change, deflects the cantilever.  This wireless actuation can be used as a substitute for complex circuit-based systems currently used for optical addressing and control of autonomous wireless sensors&lt;ref&gt;Yick, Jennifer, Biswanath Mukherjee, and Dipak Ghosal. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128608001254 Wireless sensor network survey.]" Computer Networks 52.12 (2008): 2292-330. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Droplet transport==
Photoelectrowetting can be used to [[droplet-based microfluidics|circulate]] aqueous solution-based [[drop (liquid)|sessile droplets]] on a silicon wafer covered with [[silicon dioxide]] and [[polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] – the latter providing a [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surface. Droplet transport is achieved by focusing a laser at the leading edge of the droplet. Droplet speeds of more than 10 mm/s can be achieved without the necessity of underlying [[digital microfluidics|patterned electrodes]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Palma and R.D. Deegan "Droplet Translation Actuated by Photoelectrowetting" Langmuir 34, 3177 (2018). {{doi|10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b03340}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RWE Supply &amp; Trading CZ''' is the largest [[natural gas]] trading company in the [[Czech Republic]]. It is owned by the [[Germany|German]] energy company [[RWE]].

The group used to own pipelines from Lanžhot on Czech-Slovak border to Germany. Its market position deteriorated in 1997 when competing [[Yamal-Europe pipeline]] was put into operation. Another threat was the [[Nord Stream]] linking Russia and Germany via Baltic sea. Its past subsidiaries include RWE Gas Storage (owns and operates several underground storages located in the Czech Republic).

'''Paul Neal "Red" Adair''' (June 18, 1915 &amp;ndash; August 7, 2004)&lt;ref name=BBCobit&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2281867.stm Obituary: Red Adair], [[BBC News]], August 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1279227,00.html Obituary: Red Adair], ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redadair.com/ Official site of Red Adair]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[oil well fire]]fighter. He became notable as an innovator in the highly specialized and hazardous profession of extinguishing and capping oil [[Blowout (oil well)|well blowouts]], both land-based and [[oil platform|offshore]].

==Life and career==
[[Image:Red Adair Elk Hills fire 1977.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Adair fighting an oil field fire in the [[Elk Hills Oil Field]] on October 27, 1977]]
Adair was born in [[Houston, Texas]], the son of an Irish blacksmith,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2281867.stm BBC News Obituary: Red Adair]&lt;/ref&gt; and attended [[Reagan High School (Houston)|Reagan High School]]. He began fighting oil well fires after returning from serving in an Army [[bomb disposal]] unit during [[World War II]]. He started his career working   for [[Myron M. Kinley|Myron Kinley]], the "original" blowout/oil firefighting pioneer. They pioneered the technique of using a V-shaped charge of high explosives (the [[Munroe effect]] being used during the war and used in bazookas and the atom bomb), the high velocity blast of which would snuff the fire. He founded Red Adair Co. Inc. in 1959, and over the course of his career battled more than 2,000 land and offshore oil well, natural gas well, and similar spectacular fires. Adair gained global attention in 1962 when he tackled a fire at the [[Gassi Touil]] gas field in the Algerian [[Sahara]] nicknamed the [[Devil's Cigarette Lighter]], a {{convert|450|foot|m}} pillar of flame that burned from 12:00 PM November 13, 1961 to 9:30 AM on April 28, 1962. In December 1968, Adair sealed a large gas leak at an [[Australia]]n gas and oil platform off [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'s southeast coast.&lt;ref name=TheAge20041010/&gt;

In 1977, he and his crew (including Asger "Boots" Hansen and Manohar "Man" Dhumtara-Kejriwal) contributed to the capping of the biggest oil well blowout to have occurred in the [[North Sea]] (and at the time the largest offshore blowout worldwide, in terms of volume of crude oil spilled&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Oil Rig Disasters / 5 Worst Offshore Blowouts | publisher = ''unknown'' | url = http://home.versatel.nl/the_sims/rig/i-blowout.htm | accessdate = 5 April 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141228083855/http://home.versatel.nl/the_sims/rig/i-blowout.htm | archivedate = 28 December 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;), at the [[Ekofisk]] Bravo platform, located in the Norwegian sector and operated by [[Phillips Petroleum Company]] (now ConocoPhillips). In 1978, Adair's top lieutenants Hansen and Ed "Coots" Matthews left to found competitor [[Boots &amp; Coots|Boots &amp; Coots International Well Control Inc.]]  In 1988, Adair was again in the North Sea where he helped to put out the UK sector [[Piper Alpha]] oil platform fire. At age 75, Adair took part in extinguishing the [[Kuwaiti oil fires|oil well fires]] in [[Kuwait]] set by retreating [[Iraq]]i troops after the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.

Adair retired in 1993, and sold The Red Adair Service and Marine Company to Global Industries.&lt;ref name="B&amp;C"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bootsandcoots.com/en-US/ps/boots-coots/history-of-halliburton.page?node-id=hg98y5rz |title="Boots, Coots, Roots" at Boots and Coots/IWC |access-date=2014-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714153242/http://www.bootsandcoots.com/en-US/ps/boots-coots/history-of-halliburton.page?node-id=hg98y5rz |archive-date=2014-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His top employees (Brian Krause, Raymond Henry, Rich Hatteberg) left in 1994 and formed their own company, International Well Control (IWC). 

Adair died in 2004 at age 89,&lt;ref name=BBCobit/&gt; survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.

==Legacy==
*The [[1968 in film|1968]] [[John Wayne]] movie [[Hellfighters (film)|''Hellfighters'']] was loosely based upon the feats of Adair during the 1962 Sahara Desert fire.
*The [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s ''[[Modern Marvels]]'' episode on "Oil Well Firefighting" was one of Adair's last interviews prior to his death. The episode aired after Adair's death and was dedicated to his memory.
*The Travel Channel's "Mysteries Of The Museum" 2014 episode "Most Explosive" features a segment on Red Adair's successful effort to stop the burning gas line in the Algerian Sahara Desert in Africa, called "The Devil's Cigarette Lighter" in 1961. 
*Adair was associated with a [[Rolex]] and [[American Express]] advertising campaign in the 1980s.
*At one point during the 1979 action film ''[[North Sea Hijack]]'', a group of terrorists are fooled into thinking a nearby offshore oil drilling platform has exploded. One of the hijackers remarks that if the authorities don't bring in Red Adair to put the fire out "it could burn for a year."

'''''S''-Methylmethionine''' (SMM) is a derivative of [[methionine]] with the [[chemical formula]] ([[Methyl|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. This [[cation]] is an intermediate in many biosynthetic pathways owing to the [[sulfonium]] [[functional group]].  The natural derivative ''S''-methylmethionine is biosynthesized from &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-methionine which is first converted to [[S-adenosylmethionine|''S''-adenosylmethionine]]. The subsequent conversion, involving replacement of the adenosyl group by a methyl group is catalyzed by the [[enzyme]] [[methionine S-methyltransferase]]. ''S''-methylmethionine is particularly abundant in plants, being more abundant than methionine.&lt;ref name=Bourgis&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1105/tpc.11.8.1485 | title = S-methylmethionine plays a major role in phloem sulfur transport and is synthesized by a novel type of methyltransferase | year = 1999 | author = Bourgis F | journal = The Plant Cell Online | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 1485–1498 | pmc = 144290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosynthesis and biochemical function==
''S''-Methylmethionine arises via the [[methylation]] of [[methionine]] by [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM).  The coproduct is [[S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine|''S''-adenosyl homocysteine]].&lt;ref name=Bourgis/&gt;

The biological roles of ''S''-methylmethionine are not well understood.  Speculated roles include methionine storage, use as a methyl donor, regulation of SAM.&lt;ref name=Bourgis/&gt; A few plants use ''S''-methylmethionine as a precursor to the [[osmolyte]] [[dimethylsulfoniopropionate]] (DMSP).  Intermediates include dimethylsulfoniumpropylamine and dimethylsulfoniumpropionaldehyde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1104/pp.120.4.945 | title = Betaines and related osmoprotectants.

==Beer flavor precursor in barley malt==
''S''-Methylmethionine is found in barley and is further created during the malting process. SMM can be subsequently converted to DMS during the malt kilning process. Lightly kilned malts such as pilsner or lager malts retain much of their SMM content while higher kilned malt such as pale ale malt has substantially more of the SMM converted to DMS in the malt. Darker kilned malts such as Munich malt have virtually no SMM content since most has been converted to DMS. Other crystal malts and roasted malts have no SMM content and often no DMS content since the kilning also drives that compound out of the malt. &lt;ref&gt;Pitz, W.

'''Silver''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ag''' (from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|argentum}}'', derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₂erǵ-|''h₂erǵ'']]: "shiny" or "white") and [[atomic number]] 47. A soft, white, lustrous [[transition metal]], it exhibits the highest [[electrical conductivity]], [[thermal conductivity]], and [[reflectivity]] of any [[metal]]. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form ("native silver"), as an [[alloy]] with [[gold]] and other metals, and in minerals such as [[argentite]] and [[chlorargyrite]]. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of [[copper]], gold, [[lead]], and [[zinc]] [[refining]].

Silver has long been valued as a [[precious metal]]. Silver metal is used in many [[bullion coin]]s, sometimes [[bimetallism|alongside gold]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.providentmetals.com/knowledge-center/precious-metals-resources/bullion-vs-numismatic-coins.html|title=BULLION VS. NUMISMATIC COINS: Difference between Bullion and Numismatic Coins|website=www.providentmetals.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a [[native metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/interview-world-has-5-times-more-gold-than-silver-1235602|title=‘World has 5 times more gold than silver' {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=2009-03-03|work=dna|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purity is typically measured on a [[per-mille]] basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as "0.940 fine". As one of the seven [[metals of antiquity]], silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures.

Other than in [[currency]] and as an [[investment]] medium ([[coins]] and [[bullion]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lpm.hk|title=Lucius Precious Metals {{!}} Buy Gold, Silver, Bullion &amp; Coins|website=www.lpm.hk|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; silver is used in [[solar panels]], [[water filtration]], [[jewellery]], ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term [[Silver (household)|silverware]]), in [[electrical contact]]s and [[Electrical conductor|conductors]], in specialized mirrors, window coatings, in [[catalysis]] of chemical reactions, as a colorant in [[stained glass]] and in specialised confectionery. Its compounds are used in [[photographic film|photographic]] and [[X-ray]] film. Dilute solutions of [[silver nitrate]] and other silver compounds are used as [[disinfectant]]s and microbiocides ([[oligodynamic effect]]), added to [[bandage]]s and wound-dressings, [[catheter]]s, and other [[medical instrument]]s.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Ag atomic wire.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Silver is extremely ductile, and can be drawn into a wire one atom wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.5772/62288 |isbn=978-953-51-2252-4 |chapter=Combined Transmission Electron Microscopy – In situ Observation of the Formation Process and Measurement of Physical Properties for Single Atomic-Sized Metallic Wires |author=Masuda, Hideki |title=Modern Electron Microscopy in Physical and Life Sciences |editor=Janecek, Milos |editor2=Kral, Robert |publisher=InTech |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Silver is similar in its physical and chemical properties to its two vertical neighbours in [[group 11 element|group 11]] of the [[periodic table]], [[copper]] and [[gold]]. Its 47 electrons are arranged in the [[electron configuration|configuration]] [Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;5s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, similarly to copper ([Ar]3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and gold ([Xe]4f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;); group 11 is one of the few groups in the [[d-block]] which has a completely consistent set of electron configurations.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; This distinctive electron configuration, with a single electron in the highest occupied s subshell over a filled d subshell, accounts for many of the singular properties of metallic silver.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1177/&gt;

Silver is an extremely soft, [[Ductility|ductile]] and [[Malleability|malleable]] [[transition metal]], though it is slightly less malleable than gold. Silver crystallizes in a [[face-centered cubic]] lattice with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is delocalized, similarly to copper and gold.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1178&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1178&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver are lacking a [[covalent bond|covalent]] character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low [[hardness]] and high ductility of [[monocrystalline|single crystals]] of silver.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book|author1=George L. Trigg|author2=Edmund H. Immergut|title=Encyclopedia of applied physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVQ5RAAACAAJ|accessdate=2 May 2011|date=1 November 1992|publisher=VCH Publishers|isbn=978-3-527-28126-8|pages=267–272|volume=4: Combustion to Diamagnetism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver has a brilliant white metallic luster that can take a high [[polishing|polish]],&lt;ref name="reflective"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Craft of Silversmithing: Techniques, Projects, Inspiration |page=43 |author=Alex Austin |isbn=978-1-60059-131-0 |date=2007 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which is so characteristic that the name of the metal itself has become a [[silver (colour)|colour name]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1177&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1177&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike copper and gold, the energy required to excite an electron from the filled d band to the s-p conduction band in silver is large enough (around 385&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) that it no longer corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, but rather in the [[ultraviolet]]; hence silver is not a coloured metal.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1177/&gt; Protected silver has greater optical [[reflectivity]] than [[aluminium]] at all wavelengths longer than ~450&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;{{cite journal|last = Edwards |first=H. W. |last2 = Petersen |first2=R. P. |date = 1936|title = Reflectivity of evaporated silver films|journal = Physical Review |volume = 50|page=871|bibcode = 1936PhRv...50..871E|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.50.871|issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At wavelengths shorter than 450&amp;nbsp;nm, silver's reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="gemin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/telescopes-and-sites/optics/silver-vs-aluminum |title=Silver vs. Aluminum |accessdate=2014-08-01 |publisher=Gemini Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very high electrical and thermal conductivity is common to the elements in group 11, because their single s electron is free and does not interact with the filled d subshell, as such interactions (which occur in the preceding transition metals) lower electron mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Russell AM &amp; Lee KL 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fIu58uZTE-gC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Structure-property relations in nonferrous metals]'', Wiley-Interscience, New York, {{ISBN|0-471-64952-X}}. p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[electrical conductivity]] of silver is the greatest of all metals, greater even than copper, but it is not widely used for this property because of the higher cost. An exception is in [[radio-frequency engineering]], particularly at [[VHF]] and higher frequencies where silver plating improves electrical conductivity because those [[Skin effect|currents tend to flow on the surface of conductors]] rather than through the interior.

Silver readily forms [[alloy]]s with copper and gold, as well as [[zinc]]. Zinc-silver alloys with low zinc concentration may be considered as face-centred cubic solid solutions of zinc in silver, as the structure of the silver is largely unchanged while the electron concentration rises as more zinc is added. Increasing the electron concentration further leads to [[body-centred cubic]] (electron concentration 1.5), [[cubic crystal system|complex cubic]] (1.615), and [[hexagonal close-packed]] phases (1.75).&lt;ref name=Greenwood1178/&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of silver}}

Naturally occurring silver is composed of two stable [[isotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;107&lt;/sup&gt;Ag and &lt;sup&gt;109&lt;/sup&gt;Ag, with &lt;sup&gt;107&lt;/sup&gt;Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% [[natural abundance]]). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table.

Twenty-eight [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;105&lt;/sup&gt;Ag with a [[half-life]] of 41.29 days, &lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;Ag with a half-life of 7.45 days, and &lt;sup&gt;112&lt;/sup&gt;Ag with a half-life of 3.13 hours.

Silver is a rather unreactive metal. This is because its filled 4d shell is not very effective in shielding the electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus to the outermost 5s electron, and hence silver is near the bottom of the [[electrochemical series]] (''E''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ag) = +0.799&amp;nbsp;V).&lt;ref name=Greenwood1177/&gt; In group 11, silver has the lowest first ionization energy (showing the instability of the 5s orbital), but has higher second and third ionization energies than copper and gold (showing the stability of the 4d orbitals), so that the chemistry of silver is predominantly that of the +1 oxidation state, reflecting the increasingly limited range of oxidation states along the transition series as the d-orbitals fill and stabilize.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1180&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1180&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike copper, for which the larger [[hydration energy]] of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as compared to Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the reason why the former is the more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking the stable filled d-subshell of the latter, with silver this effect is swamped by its larger second ionisation energy. Hence, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the stable species in aqueous solution and solids, with Ag&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; being much less stable as it oxidizes water.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1180/&gt;

Most silver compounds have significant [[covalent bond|covalent]] character due to the small size and high first ionization energy (730.8&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) of silver.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1177/&gt; Furthermore, silver's Pauling [[electronegativity]] of 1.93 is higher than that of [[lead]] (1.87), and its [[electron affinity]] of 125.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol is much higher than that of [[hydrogen]] (72.8&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) and not much less than that of [[oxygen]] (141.0&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol).&lt;ref name=Greenwood1176&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1176&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable [[organometallic compound]]s, forming linear complexes showing very low [[coordination number]]s like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide&lt;ref&gt;Lidin RA 1996, ''Inorganic substances handbook'', begell house, New York, {{ISBN|1-56700-065-7}}. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Zintl phase]]s like the [[post-transition metal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin F, Guruswamy S, Kainer KU, Kammer C, Knabl W, Koethe A, Leichtfreid G, Schlamp G, Stickler R &amp; Warlimont H 2005, 'Noble metals and noble metal alloys', in ''Springer Handbook of Condensed Matter and Materials Data,'' W Martienssen &amp; H Warlimont (eds), Springer, Berlin, pp.&amp;nbsp;329–406, {{ISBN|3-540-44376-2}}. p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the preceding transition metals, the +1 oxidation state of silver is stable even in the absence of [[pi backbonding|π-acceptor ligands]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1180/&gt;

Silver does not react with air, even at red heat, and thus was considered by [[alchemist]]s as a [[noble metal]] along with gold. Its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper (which forms [[copper(I) oxide]] when heated in air to red heat) and gold. Like copper, silver reacts with [[sulfur]] and its compounds; in their presence, silver tarnishes in air to form the black [[silver sulfide]] (copper forms the green [[sulfate]] instead, while gold does not react). Unlike copper, silver will not react with the halogens, with the exception of [[fluorine]] gas, with which it forms the [[silver(II) fluoride|difluoride]]. While silver is not attacked by non-oxidizing acids, the metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], as well as dilute or concentrated [[nitric acid]]. In the presence of air, and especially in the presence of [[hydrogen peroxide]], silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of [[cyanide]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1179&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1179&lt;/ref&gt;

The three main forms of deterioration in historical silver artifacts are tarnishing, formation of [[silver chloride]] due to long-term immersion in salt water, as well as reaction with [[nitrate]] ions or oxygen. Fresh silver chloride is pale yellow, becoming purplish on exposure to light; it projects slightly from the surface of the artifact or coin. The precipitation of copper in ancient silver can be used to date artifacts, as copper is nearly always a constituent of silver alloys.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130509014548/http://events.nace.org/library/corrosion/Artifacts/silver.asp "Silver Artifacts"] in ''Corrosion – Artifacts''. NACE Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver metal is attacked by strong oxidizers such as [[potassium permanganate]] ({{chem|KMnO|4}}) and [[potassium dichromate]] ({{chem|K|2|Cr|2|O|7}}), and in the presence of [[potassium bromide]] ({{chem|KBr}}). These compounds are used in photography to [[bleach]] silver images, converting them to silver bromide that can either be fixed with [[thiosulfate]] or redeveloped to [[potassium dichromate#photography|intensify]] the original image. Silver forms [[cyanide]] complexes ([[silver cyanide]]) that are soluble in water in the presence of an excess of cyanide ions. Silver cyanide solutions are used in [[electroplating]] of silver.&lt;ref name=photo&gt;{{cite book| pages = 156–166| title=Silver-halide recording materials: for holography and their processing| last = Bjelkhagen |first=Hans I.| publisher= Springer| date =1995| isbn = 978-3-540-58619-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common [[oxidation state]]s of silver are (in order of commonness): +1 (the most stable state; for example, [[silver nitrate]], AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;); +2 (highly oxidising; for example, [[silver(II) fluoride]], AgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); and even very rarely +3 (extreme oxidising; for example, potassium tetrafluoroargentate(III), KAgF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riedel |first1=Sebastian |last2=Kaupp |first2=Martin |date=2009 |title=The highest oxidation states of the transition metal elements |journal=Coordination Chemistry Reviews |volume=253 |issue=5–6 |doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2008.07.014|pages=606–624}}&lt;/ref&gt; The +1 state is by far the most common, followed by the easily reducible +2 state. The +3 state requires very strong oxidising agents to attain, such as [[fluorine]] or [[peroxodisulfate]], and some silver(III) compounds react with atmospheric moisture and attack glass.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1188&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1188&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, silver(III) fluoride is usually obtained by reacting silver or silver monofluoride with the strongest known oxidizing agent, [[krypton difluoride]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood903&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 903&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compounds==
===Oxides and chalcogenides===
[[File:Sulfid stříbrný.PNG|thumb|right|Silver(I) sulfide]]
Silver and gold have rather low [[chemical affinity|chemical affinities]] for oxygen, lower than copper, and it is therefore expected that silver oxides are thermally quite unstable. Soluble silver(I) salts precipitate dark-brown [[silver(I) oxide]], Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, upon the addition of alkali. (The hydroxide AgOH exists only in solution; otherwise it spontaneously decomposes to the oxide.) Silver(I) oxide is very easily reduced to metallic silver, and decomposes to silver and oxygen above 160&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1181&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1181–2&lt;/ref&gt; This and other silver(I) compounds may be oxidized by the strong oxidizing agent [[peroxodisulfate]] to black AgO, a mixed [[silver(I,III) oxide]] of formula Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;Ag&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Some other mixed oxides with silver in non-integral oxidation states, namely Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, are also known, as is Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O which behaves as a metallic conductor.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1181/&gt;

[[Silver(I) sulfide]], Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, is very readily formed from its constituent elements and is the cause of the black tarnish on some old silver objects. It may also be formed from the reaction of [[hydrogen sulfide]] with silver metal or aqueous Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Many non-stoichiometric [[selenide]]s and [[telluride (chemistry)|tellurides]] are known; in particular, AgTe&lt;sub&gt;~3&lt;/sub&gt; is a low-temperature [[superconductor]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1181/&gt;

===Halides===
{{main|Silver halide}}
[[File:Common Silver Halide Precipitates.jpg|thumb|right|The three common silver halide precipitates: from left to right, [[silver iodide]], [[silver bromide]], and [[silver chloride]].]]
The only known dihalide of silver is [[silver(II) fluoride|the difluoride]], AgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which can be obtained from the elements under heat. A strong yet thermally stable and therefore safe fluorinating agent, silver(II) fluoride is often used to synthesize [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1183&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1183–5&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark contrast to this, all four silver(I) halides are known. The [[silver(I) fluoride|fluoride]], [[silver chloride|chloride]], and [[silver bromide|bromide]] have the sodium chloride structure, but the [[silver iodide|iodide]] has three known stable forms at different temperatures; that at room temperature is the cubic [[zinc blende]] structure. They can all be obtained by the direct reaction of their respective elements.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1183/&gt; As the halogen group is descended, the silver halide gains more and more covalent character, solubility decreases, and the color changes from the white chloride to the yellow iodide as the energy required for [[charge-transfer complex|ligand-metal charge transfer]] (X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → XAg) decreases.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1183/&gt; The fluoride is anomalous, as the fluoride ion is so small that it has a considerable [[solvation]] energy and hence is highly water-soluble and forms di- and tetrahydrates.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1183/&gt; The other three silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are very commonly used in gravimetric [[Wet chemistry|analytical]] methods.&lt;ref name=IUPAC/&gt; All four are [[photosensitive]] (though the monofluoride is so only to [[ultraviolet]] light), especially the bromide and iodide which photodecompose to silver metal, and thus were used in traditional photography.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1183/&gt; The reaction involved is:&lt;ref name=Greenwood1185&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1185–7&lt;/ref&gt;
:X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + ''hν'' → X + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (excitation of the halide ion, which gives up its extra electron into the conduction band)
:Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Ag (liberation of a silver ion, which gains an electron to become a silver atom)

The process is not reversible because the silver atom liberated is typically found at a [[crystal defect]] or an impurity site, so that the electron's energy is lowered enough that it is "trapped".&lt;ref name=Greenwood1185/&gt;

===Other inorganic compounds===
[[File:Silver nitrate crystals.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.45|Crystals of silver nitrate]]
White [[silver nitrate]], AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is a versatile precursor to many other silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was once called ''lunar caustic'' because silver was called ''luna'' by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver was associated with the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.die.net/lunar%20caustic |title=Definition of Lunar Caustic |website=dictionary.die.net |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131215637/http://dictionary.die.net/lunar%20caustic |archivedate=31 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used for gravimetric analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the heavier silver halides which it is a common precursor to.&lt;ref name=IUPAC/&gt; Silver nitrate is used in many ways in [[organic synthesis]], e.g. for [[deprotection]] and oxidations. Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; binds [[alkene]]s reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting [[adduct]] can be decomposed with [[ammonia]] to release the free alkene.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author = Cope, A. C.; Bach, R. D.|title = trans-Cyclooctene|collvol = 5|collvolpages = 315|year = 1973|prep = cv5p0315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yellow [[silver carbonate]], Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be easily prepared by reacting aqueous solutions of [[sodium carbonate]] with a deficiency of silver nitrate.&lt;ref name=OS&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = McCloskey C. M.; Coleman, G. H. | title = β-d-Glucose-2,3,4,6-Tetraacetate | collvol = 3 | collvolpages = 434 | year = 1955 | prep = cv3p0434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal use is for the production of silver powder for use in microelectronics. It is reduced with [[formaldehyde]], producing silver free of alkali metals:&lt;ref name=Ull&gt;Andreas Brumby et al. "Silver, Silver Compounds, and Silver Alloys" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2008. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_107.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Ag + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Silver carbonate is also used as a [[reagent]] in organic synthesis such as the [[Koenigs-Knorr reaction]]. In the [[Fétizon oxidation]], silver carbonate on [[celite]] acts as an [[oxidising agent]] to form [[lactone]]s from [[diols]]. It is also employed to convert [[alkyl]] bromides into [[alcohol]]s.&lt;ref name=OS/&gt;

[[Silver fulminate]], AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive [[explosive]] used in [[percussion cap]]s, is made by reaction of silver metal with nitric acid in the presence of [[ethanol]]. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are [[silver azide]], AgN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, formed by reaction of [[silver nitrate]] with [[sodium azide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=ATiYCfo1VcEC&amp;pg=PA284| page = 284| title = Explosives| last = Meyer |first=Rudolf| last2 = Köhler |first2=Josef| last3 = Homburg |first3=Axel| last-author-amp = yes |publisher = Wiley–VCH| date = 2007| isbn = 978-3-527-31656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[silver acetylide]], Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, formed when silver reacts with [[acetylene]] gas in [[ammonia]] solution.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1180/&gt; In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1180/&gt;

Silver complexes tend to be similar to those of its lighter homologue copper. Silver(III) complexes tend to be rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, though they are slightly more stable than those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate [Ag(IO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;5−&lt;/sup&gt; and tellurate [Ag{TeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;5−&lt;/suP&gt; complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline [[peroxodisulfate]]. The yellow diamagnetic [AgF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is much less stable, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1188/&gt;

Silver(II) complexes are more common. Like the valence isoelectronic copper(II) complexes, they are usually square planar and paramagnetic, which is increased by the greater field splitting for 4d electrons than for 3d electrons. Aqueous Ag&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, produced by oxidation of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by ozone, is a very strong oxidising agent, even in acidic solutions: it is stabilized in [[phosphoric acid]] due to complex formation. Peroxodisulfate oxidation is generally necessary to give the more stable complexes with heterocyclic [[amine]]s, such as [Ag(py)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [Ag(bipy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;: these are stable provided the counterion cannot reduce the silver back to the +1 oxidation state. [AgF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; is also known in its violet barium salt, as are some silver(II) complexes with ''N''- or ''O''-donor ligands such as pyridine carboxylates.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1189&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1189&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the most important oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Au&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion [Ag(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;; silver salts are dissolved in photography due to the formation of the thiosulfate complex [Ag(S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;; and [[cyanide]] extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex [Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag–C≡N→Ag–C≡N→}; silver [[thiocyanate]] has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-[[orbital hybridization|hybridized]] sulfur atom. [[Chelating ligand]]s are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver(I) complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral [[diphosphine]] and [[diarsine]] complexes [Ag(L–L)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1195&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1195–6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organometallic===
{{main|Organosilver chemistry}}
Under standard conditions, silver does not form simple carbonyls, due to the weakness of the Ag–C bond. A few are known at very low temperatures around 6–15&amp;nbsp;K, such as the green, planar paramagnetic Ag(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which dimerizes at 25–30&amp;nbsp;K, probably by forming Ag–Ag bonds. Additionally, the silver carbonyl [Ag(CO)] [B(OTeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] is known. Polymeric AgLX complexes with [[alkene]]s and [[alkyne]]s are known, but their bonds are thermodynamically weaker than even those of the [[platinum]] complexes (though they are formed more readily than those of the analogous gold complexes): they are also quite unsymmetrical, showing the weak ''π'' bonding in group 11. Ag–C ''σ'' bonds may also be formed by silver(I), like copper(I) and gold(I), but the simple alkyls and aryls of silver(I) are even less stable than those of copper(I) (which tend to explode under ambient conditions). For example, poor thermal stability is reflected in the relative decomposition temperatures of AgMe (−50&amp;nbsp;°C) and CuMe (−15&amp;nbsp;°C) as well as those of PhAg (74&amp;nbsp;°C) and PhCu (100&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=Greenwood1199&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1199–200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intermetallic===
[[File:Ag-Au-Cu-colours-english.svg|thumb|upright=1.14|right|Different colors of silver–copper–gold alloys]]
Silver forms [[alloy]]s with most other elements on the periodic table. The elements from groups 1–3, except for [[hydrogen]], [[lithium]], and [[beryllium]], are very miscible with silver in the condensed phase and form intermetallic compounds; those from groups 4–9 are only poorly miscible; the elements in groups 10–14 (except [[boron]] and [[carbon]]) have very complex Ag–M phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys; and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their Ag–M phase diagrams. By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver–copper alloy, and the [[eutectic mixture]] is used in vacuum [[brazing]]. The two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry comes from the fact that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the eutectic mixture (71.9% silver and 28.1% copper by weight, and 60.1% silver and 28.1% copper by atom).&lt;ref name=Ullmann54&gt;Ullmann, pp. 54–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Most other binary alloys are of little use: for example, silver–gold alloys are too soft and silver–[[cadmium]] alloys too toxic. Ternary alloys have much greater importance: dental [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgams]] are usually silver–tin–mercury alloys, silver–copper–gold alloys are very important in jewellery (usually on the gold-rich side) and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours, silver–copper–zinc alloys are useful as low-melting brazing alloys, and silver–cadmium–[[indium]] (involving three adjacent elements on the periodic table) is useful in [[nuclear reactor]]s because of its high thermal neutron capture [[Cross section (physics)|cross-section]], good conduction of heat, mechanical stability, and resistance to corrosion in hot water.&lt;ref name=Ullmann54/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "silver" appears in [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] in various spellings, such as ''seolfor'' and ''siolfor''. A similar form is seen throughout the [[Germanic languages]] (compare [[Old High German]] ''silabar'' and ''silbir''). The chemical symbol Ag is from the [[Latin]] word for "silver", ''argentum'' (compare [[Ancient Greek]] ἄργυρος, ''árgyros''), from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *''h₂erǵ-'' (formerly reconstructed as ''*arǵ-''), meaning "white" or "shining": this was the usual Proto-Indo-European word for the metal, whose reflexes are missing in Germanic and [[Balto-Slavic]]. The Balto-Slavic words for silver are quite similar to the Germanic ones (e.g. [[Russian language|Russian]] ''серебро'' [''serebro''], [[Polish language|Polish]] ''srebro'', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''sidabras'') and they may have a common origin, although this is uncertain: some scholars have suggested the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''sarpu'' "refined silver" as this origin, related to the word ''sarapu'' "to refine or smelt".&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vadásztál (2).jpg|thumb|Silver plate from the 4th century]]
Silver was one of the seven [[metals of antiquity]] that were known to prehistoric humans and whose discovery is thus lost to history.&lt;ref name=Weeks4&gt;Weeks, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the three metals of group 11, copper, silver, and gold, occur in the [[native metal|elemental form]] in nature and were probably used as the first primitive forms of [[money]] as opposed to simple bartering.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1173&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1173–4&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike copper, silver did not lead to the growth of [[metallurgy]] on account of its low structural strength, and was more often used ornamentally or as money.&lt;ref name=metallurgy&gt;{{cite book |last=Readon |first=Arthur C. |date=2011 |title=Metallurgy for the Non-Metallurgist |publisher=ASM International |pages=73–84 |isbn=978-1-61503-821-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since silver is more reactive than gold, supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1173/&gt; For example, silver was more expensive than gold in Egypt until around the fifteenth century BC:&lt;ref name=Weeks14&gt;Weeks, pp. 14–19&lt;/ref&gt; the Egyptians are thought to have separated gold from silver by heating the metals with salt, and then reducing the [[silver chloride]] produced to the metal.&lt;ref name=Ullmann16/&gt;

The situation changed with the discovery of [[cupellation]], a technique that allowed silver metal to be extracted from its ores. While [[slag]] heaps found in [[Asia Minor]] and on the islands of the [[Aegean Sea]] indicate that silver was being separated from [[lead]] as early as the [[4th millennium BC]],&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; and one of the earliest silver extraction centres in Europe was [[Sardinia]] in early the [[Chalcolithic period]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/9860173|title=Silver in Neolithic and Eneolithic Sardinia, in H.

when it spread throughout the region and beyond.&lt;ref name=Weeks14/&gt; The origins of silver production in [[India]], [[China]], and [[Japan]] were almost certainly equally ancient, but are not well-documented due to their great age.&lt;ref name=Ullmann16/&gt;

When the [[Phoenicia]]ns first came to what is now [[Spain]], they obtained so much silver that they could not fit it all on their ships, and as a result used silver to weight their anchors instead of lead.&lt;ref name=Weeks14/&gt; By the time of the Greek and Roman civilizations, silver coins were a staple of the economy:&lt;ref name=Greenwood1173/&gt; the Greeks were already extracting silver from [[galena]] by the 7th century BC,&lt;ref name=Weeks14/&gt; and the rise of [[Athens]] was partly made possible by the nearby silver mines at [[Laurium]], from which they extracted about 30 tonnes a year from 600 to 300 BC.&lt;ref name=nbb&gt;{{cite book| pages=492–8| title =Nature's building blocks: an A-Z guide to the elements|first =John|last=Emsley| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-960563-7| date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stability of the [[Roman currency]] relied to a high degree on the supply of silver bullion, mostly from Spain, which [[Roman metallurgy|Roman miners]] produced on a scale unparalleled before the [[discovery of the New World]].

This production came to a nearly complete halt with the fall of the Roman Empire, not to resume until the time of [[Charlemagne]]: by then, tens of thousands of tonnes of silver had already been extracted.&lt;ref name=Ullmann16&gt;Ullmann, pp. 16–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Central Europe became the centre of silver production during the [[Middle Ages]], as the Mediterranean deposits exploited by the ancient civilisations had been exhausted. Silver mines were opened in [[Bohemia]], [[Saxony]], [[Erzgebirge]], [[Alsace]], the [[Lahn]] region, [[Siegerland]], [[Silesia]], [[Hungary]], [[Norway]], [[Steiermark]], [[Salzburg]], and the southern [[Black Forest]]. Most of these ores were quite rich in silver and could simply be separated by hand from the remaining rock and then smelted; some deposits of native silver were also encountered. Many of these mines were soon exhausted, but a few of them remained active until the [[Industrial Revolution]], before which the world production of silver was around a meagre 50&amp;nbsp;tonnes per year.&lt;ref name=Ullmann16/&gt; In the Americas, high temperature silver-lead [[cupellation]] technology was developed by pre-Inca civilizations as early as AD 60–120; silver deposits in India, China, Japan, and pre-Columbian America continued to be mined during this time.&lt;ref name=Ullmann16/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carol A.

With the discovery of America and the plundering of silver by the Spanish conquistadors, Central and South America became the dominant producers of silver until around the beginning of the 18th century, particularly [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], and [[Argentina]]:&lt;ref name=Ullmann16/&gt; the last of these countries later took its name from that of the metal that composed so much of its mineral wealth.&lt;ref name=nbb/&gt; The silver trade this was a part of gave way to a global network of exchange. As one historian put it, silver "went round the world and made the world go round."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age|last=Frank|first=Andre Gunder|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|location=Berkeley|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this silver ended up in the hands of the Chinese. A Portuguese merchant in 1621 noted that silver "wanders throughout all the world... before flocking to China, where it remains as if at its natural center."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Glahn|first=Richard|date=1996|title=Myth and Reality of China's Seventeenth Century Monetary Crisis|url=|journal=Journal of Economic History|volume=2|pages=132|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, much of it went to Spain, allowing Spanish rulers to pursue military and political ambitions in both Europe and the Americas. "New World mines," concluded several historians, "supported the Spanish empire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995|title=Born with a "Silver Spoon"|url=|journal=Journal of World History|volume=2|pages=210|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, primary production of silver moved to North America, particularly [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and [[Nevada]] in the [[United States]]: some secondary production from lead and zinc ores also took place in Europe, and deposits in [[Siberia]] and the [[Russian Far East]] as well as in [[Australia]] were mined.&lt;ref name="Ullmann16" /&gt; [[Poland]] emerged as an important producer during the 1970s after the discovery of copper deposits that were rich in silver, before the centre of production returned to the Americas the following decade. Today, Peru and Mexico are still among the primary silver producers, but the distribution of silver production around the world is quite balanced and about one-fifth of the silver supply comes from recycling instead of new production.&lt;ref name="Ullmann16" /&gt;

==Symbolic role==
[[File:6852 les deniers de judas.JPG|thumb|right|16th-century fresco painting of Judas being paid thirty pieces of silver for his betrayal of Jesus]]
Silver plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage as a metaphor and in folklore. The Greek poet [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' (lines 109–201) lists different [[ages of man]] named after metals like gold, silver, bronze and iron to account for successive ages of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Eddy Fontenrose]]: ''Work, Justice, and Hesiod's Five Ages.'' In: ''Classical Philology.'' V. 69, Nr. 1, 1974, p. 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' contains another retelling of the story, containing an illustration of silver's metaphorical use of signifying the second-best in a series, better than bronze but worse than gold:
{{Quote|text=&lt;poem&gt;But when good [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], banish'd from above,
Was driv'n to Hell, the world was under [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]].
Succeeding times a silver age behold,
Excelling brass, but more excell'd by gold.&lt;/poem&gt;|sign=Ovid|source=[[Metamorphoses]], Book I, trans. [[John Dryden]]}}
In folklore, silver was commonly thought to have mystic powers: for example, a [[bullet]] cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only weapon that is effective against a [[werewolf]], [[witch]], or other [[monster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Jackson|year=1995|title=Witchcraft and the Occult|publisher=Devizes, Quintet Publishing|page=25|isbn=978-1-85348-888-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="narodna"&gt;{{cite book|last=Стойкова|first=Стефана|title=Българска народна поезия и проза в седем тома|publisher=ЕИ "LiterNet"|location=Варна|volume= Т.

Silver production has also inspired figurative language. Clear references to cupellation occur throughout the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]], such as in [[Jeremiah]]'s rebuke to Judah: "The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them." (Jeremiah 6:19–20) Jeremiah was also aware of sheet silver, exemplifying the malleability and ductility of the metal: "Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men." (Jeremiah 10:9)&lt;ref name=Weeks14/&gt;

Silver also has more negative cultural meanings: the idiom [[wikt:thirty pieces of silver|thirty pieces of silver]], referring to a reward for betrayal, references the bribe [[Judas Iscariot]] is said in the [[New Testament]] to have taken from Jewish leaders in [[Jerusalem]] to turn [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] over to soldiers of the high priest Caiaphas.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Matthew|26:15|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethically, silver also symbolizes greed and degradation of consciousness; this is the negative aspect, the perverting of its value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chevalier |first1=Jean |last2=Gheerbrant |first2=Alain |date=2009 |title=Dicționar de Simboluri.

The abundance of silver in the Earth's crust is 0.08&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million]], almost exactly the same as that of [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. It mostly occurs in [[sulfide]] ores, especially [[acanthite]] and [[argentite]], Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. Argentite deposits sometimes also contain [[native metal|native]] silver when they occur in reducing environments, and when in contact with salt water they are converted to [[chlorargyrite]] (including [[horn silver]]), AgCl, which is prevalent in [[Chile]] and [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1174&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1174–6&lt;/ref&gt; Most other silver minerals are silver [[pnictide]]s or [[chalcogenide]]s; they are generally lustrous semiconductors.

Silver is usually found in nature combined with other metals, or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally in the form of [[sulfides]] such as [[galena]] (lead sulfide) or [[cerussite]] (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then [[cupellation]] of argentiferous lead ores, a historically important process.&lt;ref name="Kassianidou"&gt;Kassianidou, V. 2003. Early Extraction of Silver from Complex Polymetallic Ores, in Craddock, P.T. and Lang, J (eds) Mining and Metal production through the Ages. London, British Museum Press: 198–206&lt;/ref&gt; Lead melts at 327&amp;nbsp;°C, lead oxide at 888&amp;nbsp;°C and silver melts at 960&amp;nbsp;°C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960&amp;nbsp;°C to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C in an oxidizing environment. The lead oxidises to [[Lead(II) oxide|lead monoxide]], then known as [[litharge]], which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by [[capillary action]] into the hearth linings.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock, P. T. 1995. Early metal mining and production.

Today, silver metal is primarily produced instead as a secondary byproduct of [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] refining of copper, lead, and zinc, and by application of the [[Parkes process]] on lead bullion from ore that also contains silver.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt; In such processes, silver follows the non-ferrous metal in question through its concentration and smelting, and is later purified out. For example, in copper production, purified copper is [[electrolysis|electrolytically]] deposited on the cathode, while the less reactive precious metals such as silver and gold collect under the anode as the so-called "anode slime". This is then separated and purified of base metals by treatment with hot aerated dilute [[sulfuric]] acid and heating with lime or silica flux, before the silver is purified to over 99.9% purity via electrolysis in [[nitrate]] solution.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1174/&gt;

Commercial-grade fine silver is at least 99.9% pure, and purities greater than 99.999% are available. In 2014, Mexico was the top producer of silver (5,000 [[tonne]]s or 18.7% of the world's total of 26,800 t), followed by China (4,060 t) and Peru (3,780 t).&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silver/|title=Silver |author=Hilliard, Henry E. |publisher=USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio between the amount of silver used for coinage and that used for other purposes has fluctuated greatly over time; for example, in wartime, more silver tends to have been used for coinage to finance the war.&lt;ref name=Ullmann63&gt;Ullmann, pp. 63–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, silver bullion has the [[ISO 4217]] currency code XAG, one of only four [[precious metal]]s to have one (the others being [[palladium]], [[platinum]], and gold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a1.html|title=Current currency &amp; funds code list – ISO Currency|website=SIX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots, rolled to the correct thickness, heat-treated, and then used to cut [[planchet|blanks]] from. These blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press; modern coining presses can produce 8000 silver coins per hour.&lt;ref name=Ullmann63/&gt;

===Price===
As of July 2018, silver is valued at around $495 per kilogram, or about $15.5 per ounce.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bullion-rates.com/silver/USD/spot-price.htm Current Silver Prices in US Dollars (USD)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver prices are normally quoted in [[Troy Weight|Troy ounces]]. One troy ounce is equal to 31.1034 grams. In 2015 China reverted to the metric system and currently prices silver (and gold) in grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lpm.hk/silver/silver-bars.html|title=Buy Silver Bars Online - Silver {{!}} LPM|website=www.lpm.hk|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://marketupdate.nl/en/china-on-gold-troy-ounce-no-more/|title=China on gold: "Troy ounce no more" - Marketupdate|date=16 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The London silver fix is published once daily at noon London time.

==Applications==

===Jewellery and silverware===
[[File:Alexandra Nikolaevna's toilet set (Fasanierie castle) 02 by shako.JPG|thumb|right|Silver toilet set of [[Grand Duchess Alexandra Nikolaevna of Russia]]]]
The major use of silver besides coinage throughout most of history was in the manufacture of [[jewellery]] and other general-use items, and this continues to be a major use today. Examples include [[household silver|table silver]] for cutlery, for which silver is highly suited due to its antibacterial properties. [[Western concert flute]]s are usually plated with or made out of [[sterling silver]];&lt;ref name=Ullmann65&gt;Ullmann, pp. 65–7&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, most silverware is only silver-plated rather than made out of pure silver; the silver is normally put in place by [[electroplating]]. Silver-plated glass (as opposed to metal) is used for mirrors, [[vacuum flask]]s, and Christmas tree decorations.&lt;ref name=Ullmann67/&gt;

Because pure silver is very soft, most silver used for these purposes is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of silver in the presence of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; [[base metal]]s like [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], [[silicon]], and [[germanium]] do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.&lt;ref name=Ullmann65/&gt; A simple chemical approach to removal of the sulfide tarnish is to bring silver items into contact with aluminium foil whilst immersed in water containing a conducting salt, such as sodium chloride.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Medicine===
{{Main|Medical uses of silver}}
In medicine, silver is incorporated into wound dressings and used as an antibiotic coating in medical devices. Wound dressings containing [[silver sulfadiazine]] or [[Silver nanoparticles|silver nanomaterials]] are used to treat external infections. Silver is also used in some medical applications, such as [[urinary catheter]]s (where tentative evidence indicates it reduces catheter-related [[urinary tract infections]]) and in [[endotracheal tube|endotracheal breathing tubes]] (where evidence suggests it reduces ventilator-associated [[pneumonia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Electronics===
Silver is very important in electronics for conductors and electrodes on account of its high electrical conductivity even when tarnished. Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, and continue to be used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their components. For example, silver is used in high quality connectors for [[Radio frequency|RF]], [[Very high frequency|VHF]], and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as [[RF and microwave filter#Cavity filters|cavity filters]] where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%. [[Printed circuit board|Printed circuits]] and [[RFID]] antennas are made with silver paints,&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikitin |first=Pavel V. |last2=Lam |first2=Sander |last3=Rao |first3=K.

===Brazing alloys===
Silver-containing [[brazing]] alloys are used for brazing metallic materials, mostly [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], and copper-based alloys, tool steels, and precious metals. The basic components are silver and copper, with other elements selected according to the specific application desired: examples include zinc, tin, cadmium, palladium, [[manganese]], and [[phosphorus]]. Silver provides increased workability and corrosion resistance during usage.&lt;ref name=Ullmann78&gt;Ullmann, pp. 78–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical equipment===
Silver is useful in the manufacture of chemical equipment on account of its low chemical reactivity, high thermal conductivity, and being easily workable. Silver [[crucible]]s (alloyed with 0.15% nickel to avoid recrystallisation of the metal at red heat) are used for carrying out alkaline fusion. Copper and silver are also used when doing chemistry with [[fluorine]]. Equipment made to work at high temperatures is often silver-plated. Silver and its alloys with gold are used as wire or ring seals for oxygen compressors and vacuum equipment.&lt;ref name=Ullmann81&gt;Ullmann, pp. 81–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catalysis===
Silver metal is a good catalyst for [[oxidation]] reactions; in fact it is somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to [[carbon dioxide]] and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or silicates is a catalyst for the oxidation of [[ethylene]] to [[ethylene oxide]] at 230–270&amp;nbsp;°C. Dehydrogenation of [[methanol]] to [[formaldehyde]] is conducted at 600–720&amp;nbsp;°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of [[isopropanol]] to [[acetone]]. In the gas phase, [[glycol]] yields [[glyoxal]] and [[ethanol]] yields [[acetaldehyde]], while organic [[amine]]s are dehydrated to [[nitrile]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann81/&gt;

===Photography===
The photosensitivity of the silver halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.&lt;ref name=Ullmann82&gt;Ullmann, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of silver nitrate and silver halides in photography has rapidly declined with the advent of digital technology. From the peak global demand for photographic silver in 1999 (267,000,000 [[troy ounce]]s or 8304.6 [[metric tonne]]s) the market contracted almost 70% by 2013.&lt;ref name="photosdemand"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goldnews.bullionvault.com/silver-bullion-photographic-demand-062120133 |title=A Big Source of Silver Bullion Demand Has Disappeared |accessdate=2014-07-20 |publisher=BullionVault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanoparticles===
{{Main|Silver nanoparticle}}

Nanosilver particles, between 10 and 100&amp;nbsp;nanometres in size, are used in many applications. They are used in conductive inks for printed electronics, and have a much lower melting point than larger silver particles of micrometre size. They are also used medicinally in antibacterials and antifungals in much the same way as larger silver particles.&lt;ref name=Ullmann83/&gt; In addition, according to the [https://euon.echa.europa.eu/ European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON)], silver nanoparticles are used both in pigments, as well as cosmetics. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euon.echa.europa.eu/nano-pigments-inventory|title=European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials pigments inventory|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euon.echa.europa.eu/catalogue-of-cosmetic-ingredients|title=European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials catalogue of nano cosmetics ingredients|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photochromic lens]]es include silver halides, so that ultraviolet light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films are used in radiation detectors. [[Zeolite]] sieves incorporating Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. [[Colloidal silver]] is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it has the advantage of not giving off a smell like [[hypochlorite]] treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small [[silver iodide]] crystals are used in [[cloud seeding]] to cause rain.&lt;ref name=Ullmann83&gt;Ullmann, pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver compounds have low toxicity compared to those of most other [[heavy metals]], as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by [[metallothionein]]. However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in [[gastroenteritis]], [[diarrhoea]], falling [[blood pressure]], cramps, paralysis, and [[respiratory arrest]]. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience [[anaemia]], slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with [[colloidal silver]] have been observed to develop localised tumours. [[Route of administration|Parenterally]] admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning.&lt;ref name=Ullmann88&gt;Ullmann, pp. 88–91&lt;/ref&gt; Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts and those of the other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.&lt;ref name=Ullmann88/&gt;

In large doses, silver and compounds containing it can be absorbed into the [[circulatory system]] and become deposited in various body tissues, leading to [[argyria]], which results in a blue-grayish pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and [[mucous membrane]]s. Argyria is rare, and so far as is known, does not otherwise harm a person's health, though it is disfiguring and usually permanent. Mild forms of argyria are sometimes mistaken for [[cyanosis]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann88/&gt;&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

Metallic silver, like copper, is an antibacterial agent, which was known to the ancients and first scientifically investigated and named the [[oligodynamic effect]] by [[Carl Nägeli]]. Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0.01–0.1&amp;nbsp;milligrams per litre; metallic silver has a similar effect due to the formation of silver oxide. This effect is lost in the presence of [[sulfur]] due to the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide.&lt;ref name=Ullmann88/&gt;

Some silver compounds are very explosive, such as the nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver [[amide]], and silver fulminate, as well as [[silver acetylide]], [[silver oxalate]], and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and [[acetylene]] should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as [[silver chlorate]] and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.&lt;ref name=Ullmann88/&gt;

[[File:SoSie+SoSchiff Ansicht.jpg|thumb|300px|The Solar Settlement with the [[Sun Ship (building)|Sun Ship]] in the background: two PlusEnergy projects in [[Freiburg]].]] 
[[File:LuftSS.jpg|thumb|300px|Solar Settlement in Freiburg.]]

The '''Solar Settlement at Schlierberg''' ({{lang-de|Solarsiedlung am Schlierberg}}) is a 59-home [[PlusEnergy]] housing community in [[Freiburg]], Germany.  Solar architect [[Rolf Disch]] wanted to apply his [[PlusEnergy]] concept, created originally with his [[Heliotrope (building)|Heliotrope]] home, to mass residential production. This residential complex won such awards as House of the Year (2002), Residential PV solar integration award (2002), Germany’s most beautiful housing community (2006).  It is the first housing community in the world in which all the homes produce a positive energy balance and which is emissions-free and {{CO2}} neutral.  Built between 2000 and 2005 in the [[Vauban, Freiburg|Vauban]] quarter of [[Freiburg]] the design of each home offers maximum energy efficiency and turns energy bills into energy income. The Solar Settlement has proved Disch’s vision of a “fundamental environmental imperative” as these homes have exhibited more than 8 years of full occupancy and each produced more than 4,000 Euros ($5,600) each year in solar energy profits.
Disch believes the image his community exhibits is equally as important as the eco-savings it brings.  Disch says 50 homes that eliminate energy bills and feed clean sustainable renewable energy into the city’s grid is the imperative we need. They contribute towards the goal of sustainable ecological and economic development and show the entire world that communities like this are economical, beautiful, comfortable and in fact preferable.  The tenants at the Solar Settlement do not claim to have made any compromises in their living situations but rather that they have both environmentally and economically improved.  Made from [[Black Forest]] timber, the wood interior and natural lighting provide for happily lit spaces and a natural flow from room to room.

==PlusEnergy==
[[PlusEnergy]] is a coined concept developed by Rolf Disch that indicates a structure’s extreme energy efficiency so that it holds a positive energy balance, actually producing more energy than it uses.  With the completion of his private residence, the [[Heliotrope (building)|Heliotrope]], in 1994, Disch had created the first PlusEnergy house in the world. The sheer logic of a home that creates more energy than it consumes made perfect sense to Disch. His next goal in its development was thus the mass application of the concept to residential, commercial and retail space.  As the concept further developed and gained financial backing as well, Disch built several more projects with PlusEnergy certifications.  PlusEnergy is a simple concept that has been materialized in a technical design.  “PlusEnergy is a fundamental environmental imperative,” Disch claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rolfdisch.de&lt;/ref&gt;  Disch believes that passive building isn’t enough because passive homes still emit {{CO2}} into the atmosphere – we can solar activate our homes!

===Community Planning===
Community planning goes hand in hand with sustainable development and thus Rolf Disch dedicates much of his design and planning to the symbiosis of his projects' surroundings.  A solar community generates identification and an enormous public image. Disch says he attracts great tenants, innovative undertakings and creative work places through his design. 
Disch always aims to create a community with combined uses for an ecological urban planning concept like traffic management – with wide, attractive walkways, bike routes and connections to public transportation.  At the Solar Settlement for example, tenants and owners incorporate bike- and carsharing and the neighborhood has an extensive car-free zone with many public transportation connections.  Disch also has incorporated community solutions for energy.  For example, a biomass cogeneration unit is extremely expedient, which meets the (reduced) additional heating demands for his PlusEnergy homes.

[[File:Luminova.JPG|thumb|LumiNova pigments in the dark]]

'''Super-LumiNova''' is a brand name under which [[strontium aluminate]]–based non-[[radioactive]] and nontoxic [[photoluminescence|photoluminescent]] or afterglow pigments for illuminating markings on [[watch]] dials, hands and bezels, etc. in the dark are marketed. This technology offers up to ten times higher brightness than previous [[zinc sulfide]]–based materials.

Super-LumiNova is based on LumiNova pigments, invented in 1993 by Nemoto &amp; Co., Ltd. of Japan as a safe replacement for [[radium]]-based luminous paints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nemoto.co.jp/en/products/luminova/luminova.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205120711/http://www.nemoto.co.jp/en/products/luminova/luminova.html |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nemoto &amp; Co. was founded in December 1941 as a luminous paint processing company and has supplied paint to the watch and clock industry for over 70 years.

Besides being used in timepieces, Super-LumiNova is also marketed for application on:

* Instruments: scales, dials, markings, indicators etc.
* Scales: engravings, silkscreen-printing
* Aviation instruments and markings
* Jewelry
* Safety- and emergency-panels, signs, markings
* Aiming posts
* Various other parts

These types of [[phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] pigments, often called [[lume]], operate like a light battery. After sufficient activation by sunlight or artificial light, they glow in the dark for hours. Larger markings are visible for the whole night. This activation and subsequent light emission process can be repeated again and again, and the material does not suffer any practical aging. Strontium aluminate–based pigments have to be protected against contact with water or moisture, since this degrades the light emitting quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rctritec.com/index.php?id=13 RC TRITEC Super-LumiNova]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nemoto.co.jp/en/products/luminova/index.html Nemoto &amp; Co., Ltd LumiNova] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517010332/http://www.nemoto.co.jp/en/products/luminova/index.html |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glowinfo.com/glow-in-the-dark/glow-in-the-dark-technology.html Glow in the Dark (Phosphorescent) Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative for afterglow pigments==
[[Tritium#Self-powered_lighting|Tritium]]-based devices called "gaseous tritium light source" (GTLS), that are an alternative for afterglow pigments, have the advantage of being self-powered and producing a consistent luminosity that does not fade during the night. However, they are radioactive and have a [[half-life]] of slightly over 12 years.  This means the intensity of the tritium-powered light source will gradually fade, generally becoming too dim to be useful after 20 to 30 years.

The '''Tactical High-Energy Laser''', or '''THEL''', was a [[laser]] developed for [[military]] use, also known as the '''Nautilus laser system'''. The mobile version is the '''Mobile Tactical High-Energy Laser''', or '''MTHEL'''.  In 1996, the United States and Israel entered into an agreement to produce a cooperative THEL called the Demonstrator, which would utilize [[deuterium fluoride laser|deuterium fluoride]] [[chemical laser]] technologies. In 2000 and 2001 THEL shot down 28 [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] [[rocket artillery|artillery rocket]]s and five [[artillery shells]]. On November 4, 2002, THEL shot down an incoming artillery shell. The prototype weapon was roughly the size of six city buses, made up of modules that held a command center, radar and a telescope for tracking targets, the chemical laser itself, fuel and reagent tanks, and a rotating mirror to reflect its beam toward speeding targets. It was discontinued in 2005.&lt;ref name="NyTimes" /&gt;

== History ==
On July 18, 1996, the United States and Israel entered into an agreement to produce a cooperative THEL, called the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrator, which would utilize [[deuterium fluoride laser|deuterium fluoride]] [[chemical laser]] technologies. Primary among the four contractors awarded the project on September 30, 1996 was [[Northrop Grumman]] (formerly [[TRW Inc.|TRW]]). THEL conducted test firing in FY1998, and [[Initial Operating Capability]] (IOC) was planned in FY1999. However, this was significantly delayed due to reorienting the project as a mobile, not fixed, design, called Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser (MTHEL). The original fixed location design eliminates most weight, size and power restrictions, but is not compatible with the fluid, mobile nature of modern combat. The initial MTHEL goal was a mobile version the size of three large semi trailers. Ideally it would be further downsized to a single semi trailer size. However, doing this while maintaining the original performance characteristics is difficult. Furthermore, the Israeli government, which had been providing significant funding, decreased their financial support in 2004, postponing the IOC date to at least 2010.

In 2000 and 2001 THEL shot down 28 [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] [[rocket artillery|artillery rockets]] and five [[artillery shells]].

On November 4, 2002, THEL shot down an incoming artillery shell. A mobile version completed successful testing. During a test conducted on August 24, 2004 the system successfully shot down multiple [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds. The test represented actual mortar threat scenarios. Targets were intercepted by the THEL testbed and destroyed. Both single mortar rounds and salvo were tested. Many military experts, such as the former head of the [[Administration for the Development of Weapons and the Technological Industry]], [[Aluf]] [[Yitzhak Ben Yisrael]], considered THEL to be a success and called for its implementation.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} However, in 2005, the US and Israel decided to discontinue developing the THEL after the project budget had surpassed $300 million. The decision came as a result of "its bulkiness, high costs and poor anticipated results on the battlefield."&lt;ref name=NyTimes&gt;{{cite news|title=US and Israel Shelved Laser as a Defense|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/world/middleeast/30laser.html |newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Ben Yisrael, currently the chairman of the [[Israeli Space Agency]], renewed his calls to implement the THEL against high-trajectory fire.

In 2007, [[Ehud Barak]] requested to reconsider project [[Skyguard (area defense system)|Skyguard]] (the next phase of THEL) in order to fight Qassam attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barak Ravid |title=בהוראת ברק: שוב נבחנת מערכת לייזר ליירוט קסאם|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1559079 |work=Haaretz |place=[[Israel|IL]] |language=Hebrew |date=2 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heavy vs light weight school classroom.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The benefit of thermal mass is shown in this comparison of how heavy and light weight constructions affect internal temperature]]
In building design, '''thermal mass''' is a property of the mass of a building which enables it to store heat, providing "inertia" against temperature fluctuations. It is sometimes known as the '''thermal flywheel effect'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theyellowhouse.org.uk/eco-prin/princip.html Principles of eco-design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404120726/http://www.theyellowhouse.org.uk/eco-prin/princip.html |date=2005-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when outside temperatures are fluctuating throughout the day, a large thermal mass within the insulated portion of a house can serve to "flatten out" the daily temperature fluctuations, since the thermal mass will absorb thermal energy when the surroundings are higher in temperature than the mass, and give thermal energy back when the surroundings are cooler, without reaching [[thermal equilibrium]]. This is distinct from a material's [[thermal insulation|insulative]] value, which reduces a building's [[thermal conductivity]], allowing it to be heated or cooled relatively separate from the outside, or even just retain the occupants' thermal energy longer.

Scientifically, thermal mass is equivalent to '''thermal capacitance''' or [[heat capacity]], the ability of a body to store [[thermal energy]]. It is typically referred to by the symbol ''C&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;'' and measured in units of J/°C or J/K (which are equivalent). Thermal mass may also be used for bodies of water, machines or machine parts, living things, or any other structure or body in engineering or biology. In those contexts, the term "heat capacity" is typically used instead.

==Background==
{{main|Heat capacity}}
The equation relating thermal energy to thermal mass is:
:&lt;math&gt;Q = C_\mathrm{th} \Delta T\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Q'' is the thermal energy transferred, ''C&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the thermal mass of the body, and Δ''T'' is the change in temperature.

For example, if 250 J of heat energy is added to a copper gear with a thermal mass of 38.46 J/°C, its temperature will rise by 6.50&amp;nbsp;°C.
If the body consists of a homogeneous material with sufficiently known physical properties, the thermal mass is simply the mass of material present times the specific heat capacity of that material. For bodies made of many materials, the sum of heat capacities for their pure components may be used in the calculation, or in some cases (as for a whole animal, for example) the number may simply be measured for the entire body in question, directly.

As an [[extensive property]], heat capacity is characteristic of an object; its corresponding [[intensive property]] is specific heat capacity, expressed in terms of a measure of the amount of material such as mass or number of moles, which must be multiplied by similar units to give the heat capacity of the entire body of material. Thus the heat capacity can be equivalently calculated as the product of the [[mass]] ''m'' of the body and the specific heat capacity ''c'' for the material, or the product of the number of [[mole (unit)|moles]] of molecules present ''n'' and the molar specific heat capacity &lt;math&gt;\bar c&lt;/math&gt;. For discussion of ''why'' the thermal energy storage abilities of pure substances vary, see [[Heat capacity#Factors that affect specific heat capacity|factors that affect specific heat capacity]].

For a body of uniform composition, &lt;math&gt;C_{th}&lt;/math&gt; can be approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;C_{th} = m c_p&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the body and &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; is the isobaric [[specific heat capacity]] of the material averaged over temperature range in question. For bodies composed of numerous different materials, the thermal masses for the different components can just be added together.

==Thermal mass in buildings==
Thermal mass is effective in improving building comfort in any place that experiences these types of daily temperature fluctuations—both in winter as well as in summer.
When used well and combined with [[passive solar design]], thermal mass can play an important role in major reductions to energy use in [[HVAC|active heating and cooling systems]].
The terms ''heavy-weight'' and ''light-weight'' are often used to describe buildings with different thermal mass strategies, and affects the choice of numerical factors used in subsequent calculations to describe their thermal response to heating and cooling.
In [[building services engineering]], the use of dynamic simulation computational modelling software has allowed for the accurate calculation of the environmental performance within buildings with different constructions and for different annual climate data sets. This allows the [[architect]] or engineer to explore in detail the relationship between heavy-weight and light-weight constructions, as well as insulation levels, in reducing energy consumption for [[HVAC|mechanical heating or cooling systems]], or even removing the need for such systems altogether.

===Properties required for good thermal mass===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Boiler]] --&gt;
Ideal materials for thermal mass are those materials that have:
* high [[specific heat capacity]],
* high [[density]]
Any solid, liquid, or gas that has [[mass]] will have some thermal mass. A common misconception is that only concrete or earth soil has thermal mass; even air has thermal mass (although very little).

A table of volumetric heat capacity for building materials is available,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourhome.gov.au/passive-design/thermal-mass&lt;/ref&gt; but note that their definition of thermal mass is slightly different.

===Use of thermal mass in different climates===
The correct use and application of thermal mass is dependent on the prevailing climate in a district.

====Temperate and cold temperate climates====

=====Solar-exposed thermal mass=====
Thermal mass is ideally placed within the building and situated where it still can be exposed to low-angle winter sunlight (via windows) but insulated from heat loss. In summer the same thermal mass should be obscured from higher-angle summer sunlight in order to prevent overheating of the structure.

The thermal mass is warmed passively by the sun or additionally by internal heating systems during the day. Thermal energy stored in the mass is then released back into the interior during the night. It is essential that it be used in conjunction with the standard principles of [[passive solar design]].

Any form of thermal mass can be used. A concrete slab foundation either left exposed or covered with conductive materials, e.g. tiles, is one easy solution. Another novel method is to place the masonry facade of a timber-framed house on the inside ('reverse-brick veneer'). Thermal mass in this situation is best applied over a large area rather than in large volumes or thicknesses. 7.5–10&amp;nbsp;cm (3-4") is often adequate.

Since the most important source of thermal energy is the Sun, the ratio of glazing to thermal mass is an important factor to consider. Various formulas have been devised to determine this.&lt;ref&gt;Chiras, D. The Solar House: Passive Heating and Cooling. Chelsea Green Publishing Company; 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; As a general rule, additional solar-exposed thermal mass needs to be applied in a ratio from 6:1 to 8:1 for any area of sun-facing (north-facing in Southern Hemisphere or south-facing in Northern Hemisphere) glazing above 7% of the total floor area. For example, a 200 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; house with 20 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of sun-facing glazing has 10% of glazing by total floor area; 6 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of that glazing will require additional thermal mass. Therefore, using the 6:1 to 8:1 ratio above, an additional 36–48 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of solar-exposed thermal mass is required. The exact requirements vary from climate to climate.

[[File:Classroom thermal mass.JPG|thumb|left|A modern school classroom with natural ventilation by opening windows and exposed thermal mass from a solid concrete floor soffit to help control summertime temperatures]]

=====Thermal mass for limiting summertime overheating=====
Thermal mass is ideally placed within a building where it is shielded from direct [[solar gain]] but exposed to the building occupants. It is therefore most commonly associated with solid concrete floor slabs in naturally ventilated or low-energy mechanically ventilated buildings where the concrete soffit is left exposed to the occupied space.

During the day heat is gained from the sun, the occupants of the building, and any electrical lighting and equipment, causing the air temperatures within the space to increase, but this heat is absorbed by the exposed concrete slab above, thus limiting the temperature rise within the space to be within acceptable levels for human thermal comfort. In addition the lower surface temperature of the concrete slab also absorbs radiant heat directly from the occupants, also benefiting their thermal comfort.

By the end of the day the slab has in turn warmed up, and now, as external temperatures decrease, the heat can be released and the slab cooled down, ready for the start of the next day. However this "regeneration" process is only effective if the building ventilation system is operated at night to carry away the heat from the slab. In naturally ventilated buildings it is normal to provide automated window openings to facilitate this process automatically.

====Hot, arid climates (e.g. desert)====
[[File:Santa Fe adobe.jpg|thumb|An adobe walled building in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]]]
This is a classical use of thermal mass. Examples include [[adobe]] or [[rammed earth]] houses. Its function is highly dependent on marked [[diurnal temperature variation]]s. The wall predominantly acts to retard heat transfer from the exterior to the interior during the day. The high [[volumetric heat capacity]] and thickness prevents thermal energy from reaching the inner surface. When temperatures fall at night, the walls re-radiate the thermal energy back into the night sky. In this application it is important for such walls to be massive to prevent heat transfer into the interior.

====Hot humid climates (e.g. sub-tropical and tropical)====
The use of thermal mass is the most challenging in this environment where night temperatures remain elevated. Its use is primarily as a temporary heat sink. However, it needs to be strategically located to prevent overheating. It should be placed in an area that is not directly exposed to solar gain and also allows adequate [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] at night to carry away stored energy without increasing internal temperatures any further. If to be used at all it should be used in judicious amounts and again not in large thicknesses.

===Materials commonly used for thermal mass===
* Water: [[water]] has the highest volumetric heat capacity of all commonly used material. Typically, it is placed in large container(s), [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] tubes for example, in an area with direct sunlight. It may also be used to saturate other types material such as soil to increase heat capacity.
* Concrete, clay bricks and other forms of masonry: the [[thermal conductivity]] of [[concrete]] depends on its composition and curing technique. Concretes with stones are more thermally conductive than concretes with ash, perlite, fibers, and other insulating aggregates.
* Insulated concrete panels consist of an inner layer of concrete to provide the thermal mass factor. This is insulated from the outside by a conventional foam insulation and then covered again with an outer layer of concrete. The effect is a highly efficient building insulation envelope.
* Insulating concrete forms are commonly used to provide thermal mass to building structures. [[Insulating concrete form]]s provide the specific heat capacity and mass of concrete. [[Thermal inertia]] of the structure is very high because the mass is insulated on both sides.
* Clay brick, adobe brick or mudbrick: see [[brick]] and [[adobe]].
* Earth, mud and sod: [[Dirt|dirt's]] heat capacity depends on its density, moisture content, particle shape, temperature, and composition. Early settlers to Nebraska built houses with thick walls made of dirt and sod because wood, stone, and other building materials were scarce. The extreme thickness of the walls provided some insulation, but mainly served as thermal mass, absorbing thermal energy during the day and releasing it during the night. Nowadays, people sometimes use [[earth sheltering]] around their homes for the same effect. In earth sheltering, the thermal mass comes not only from the walls of the building, but from the surrounding earth that is in physical contact with the building. This provides a fairly constant, moderating temperature that reduces heat flow through the adjacent wall.
* Rammed earth: [[rammed earth]] provides excellent thermal mass because of its high density, and the high specific heat capacity of the soil used in its construction.
* Natural rock and stone: see [[stonemasonry]].
* Logs are used as a building material to create the exterior, and perhaps also the interior, walls of homes. Log homes differ from some other construction materials listed above because solid wood has both moderate R-value (insulation) and also significant thermal mass. In contrast, water, earth, rocks, and concrete all have low R-values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/research/detailed_papers/thermal/index.html Thermal Mass - Energy Savings Potential in Residential Buildings]{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This thermal mass allows a log home to hold heat better in colder weather, and to better retain its cooler temperature in hotter weather.
* [[Phase-change material]]s

===Seasonal energy storage===
If enough mass is used it can create a seasonal advantage. That is, it can heat in the winter and cool in the summer. This is sometimes called [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|passive annual heat storage]] or PAHS. The PAHS system has been successfully used at 7000&amp;nbsp;ft. in Colorado and in a number of homes in Montana.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The [[Earthship|Earthships of New Mexico]] utilize passive heating and cooling as well as using recycled tires for foundation wall yielding a maximum PAHS/STES. It has also been used successfully in the UK at [[Hockerton Housing Project]].

'''Yarn''' is a long continuous length of interlocked [[fibre]]s, suitable for use in the production of [[textile]]s, [[sewing]], [[crochet]]ing, [[knitting]], [[weaving]], [[embroidery]], or [[rope]]making.&lt;ref name=definition&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/yarn|title=Yarn|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507191854/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/yarn|archivedate=2012-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thread (yarn)|Thread]] is a type of yarn intended for sewing by hand or [[sewing machine|machine]]. Modern manufactured sewing threads may be finished with [[wax]] or other lubricants to withstand the stresses involved in sewing.&lt;ref&gt;Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: ''Textiles'', 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, {{ISBN|0-13-118769-4}}, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; [[Embroidery thread]]s are yarns specifically designed for needlework.

==Etymology==
The word yarn comes from [[Middle English]], from the [[Old English]] ''gearn'', akin to [[Old High German]]'s ''garn'' yarn, [[Greek language|Greek]]'s ''chordē'' string, and [[Sanskrit]]'s ''hira'' band.&lt;ref name=definition/&gt;


==Materials==
Yarn can be made from a number of [[natural fiber|natural]] or [[synthetic fiber]]s. Many types of yarn are made differently though. There are two main types of yarn: spun and filament.

===Fibers===
[[File:Flügelspinnmaschine.jpeg|thumb|right|Cotton being slubbed]]
The most common plant fiber is [[cotton]], which is typically&lt;ref name="advameg"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; spun into fine yarn for mechanical weaving or knitting into [[cloth]].

Cotton and polyester are the most commonly spun fibers in the world.  Cotton is grown throughout the world. After harvesting it is [[Cotton gin|ginned]] and prepared for yarn spinning. Polyester is extruded from [[polymer]]s derived from natural gas and oil. Synthetic fibers are generally extruded in continuous strands of gel-state materials. These strands are drawn (stretched), annealed (hardened), and cured to obtain properties desirable for later processing.

Synthetic fibers come in three basic forms: staple, tow, and filament. Staple is cut fibers, generally sold in lengths up to 120mm.  Tow is a continuous "rope" of fibers consisting of many filaments loosely joined side-to-side.  Filament is a continuous strand consisting of anything from 1 filament to many.  Synthetic fiber is most often [[Units of textile measurement|measured in a weight per linear measurement basis]], along with cut length.  Denier and Dtex are the most common weight to length measures.  Cut-length only applies to staple fiber.

Filament extrusion is sometimes referred to as "spinning" but most people equate spinning with spun yarn production.  
   
The most commonly spun animal fiber is [[wool]] harvested from [[sheep]]. For hand knitting and hobby knitting, thick, wool and acrylic yarns are frequently used.

Other animal fibers used include [[alpaca]], [[Angora wool|angora]], [[mohair]], [[llama]], [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]], and [[silk]].  More rarely, yarn may be spun from [[camel]], [[yak]], [[common brushtail possum|possum]], [[musk ox]], [[cat]], [[Chiengora|dog]], [[wolf]], [[Domestic rabbit|rabbit]], or [[bovine|buffalo]] hair, and even turkey or [[ostrich]] feathers.&lt;!-- There should probably be some kind of citation on each of these animals, because their use as yarn materials are rare and therefore probably debatable. --&gt; Natural fibers such as these have the advantage of being slightly elastic and very breathable, while trapping a great deal of air, making for a fairly warm fabric.

Other natural fibers that can be used for yarn include [[linen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XR4mCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22linen%22+used+to+make+yarn#v=onepage&amp;q=%22linen%22%20used%20to%20make%20yarn&amp;f=false|title=J.J.

The finished product will also look rather different from the woollen yarns. Other plant fibers which can be spun include [[bamboo]], [[hemp]], [[corn]], [[Urtica dioica|nettle]], and [[soy]] fiber.&lt;!-- Again, citations for these would be nice --&gt;

===Comparison of material properties===

In general, natural fibers tend to require more careful handling than synthetics because they can shrink, [[felt]], stain, shed, fade, stretch, wrinkle, or be eaten by [[moth]]s more readily, unless special treatments such as [[mercerized cotton|mercerization]] or [[superwash]]ing are performed to strengthen, fix color, or otherwise enhance the fiber's own properties.

Protein yarns (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;hair, silk, feathers) may also be irritating to some people, causing [[contact dermatitis]], [[hives]], [[wheeze|wheezing]], or other reactions. Plant fibers tend to be better tolerated by people with sensitivities to the protein yarns, and allergists may suggest using them or synthetics instead to prevent symptoms. Some people find that they can tolerate organically grown and processed versions of protein fibers, possibly because organic processing standards preclude the use of chemicals that may irritate the skin.

When natural hair-type fibers are burned, they tend to singe and have a smell of burnt hair; this is because many, as human hair, are protein-derived.  Cotton and viscose (rayon) yarns burn as a wick. Synthetic yarns generally tend to melt though some synthetics are inherently flame-retardant. Noting how an unidentified fiber strand burns and smells can assist in determining if it is natural or synthetic, and what the fiber content is.

Both synthetic and natural yarns can [[Pill (textile)|pill]]. Pilling is a function of fiber content, spinning method, twist, contiguous staple length, and fabric construction. Single ply yarns or using fibers like merino wool are known to pill more due to the fact that in the former, the single ply is not tight enough to securely retain all the fibers under abrasion, and the merino wool's short staple length allows the ends of the fibers to pop out of the twist more easily.

Yarns combining synthetic and natural fibers inherit the properties of each parent, according to the proportional composition.  Synthetics are added to lower cost, increase durability, add unusual color or visual effects, provide machine washability and stain resistance, reduce heat retention or lighten garment weight.

'''Spun yarn''' is made by twisting [[staple (textiles)|staple]] [[fibre]]s together to make a cohesive thread, or "single."&lt;ref&gt;Kadolph, ''Textiles'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Twisting fibres into yarn in the process called [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] can be dated back to the [[Upper Paleolithic]],&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Elizabeth Wayland, ''Women's Work:The First 20,000 Years'', W. W. Norton, 1994, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and yarn spinning was one of the very first processes to be [[industrialized]]. Spun yarns may contain a single type of fibre, or be a blend of various types. Combining [[synthetic fiber|synthetic fibres]] (which can have high strength, lustre, and fire retardant qualities) with natural fibres (which have good water absorbency and skin comforting qualities) is very common. The most widely used blends are [[cotton]]-[[polyester]] and [[wool]]-[[acrylic fibre]] blends. Blends of different [[natural]] fibres are common too, especially with more expensive fibres such as [[alpaca wool|alpaca]], [[angora wool|angora]] and [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]].

Yarn is selected for different textiles based on the characteristics of the yarn fibres, such as warmth (wool), light weight (cotton or rayon), durability (nylon is added to sock yarn, for example), or softness (cashmere, alpaca).

Yarn is composed of twisted strands of fiber, which are known as plies when grouped together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4eEpAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=Yarn+twisted+strands+of+fiber,+which+are+known+as+plies+when+grouped+together.#v=onepage&amp;q=Yarn%20twisted%20strands%20of%20fiber,%20which%20are%20known%20as%20plies%20when%20grouped%20together.&amp;f=false|title=Construction Materials Reference Book|last=Doran|first=David|last2=Cather|first2=Bob|date=2013-07-24|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135139216|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211042955/https://books.google.com/books?id=4eEpAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=Yarn+twisted+strands+of+fiber,+which+are+known+as+plies+when+grouped+together.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwios7K96vrWAhVIs1QKHekDAu0Q6AEIPzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Yarn%20twisted%20strands%20of%20fiber,%20which%20are%20known%20as%20plies%20when%20grouped%20together.&amp;f=false|archivedate=2018-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These strands of yarn are twisted together ([[plying|plied]]) in the opposite direction to make a thicker yarn. Depending on the direction of this final twist, the yarn will have either ''s&amp;#8209;twist'' (the threads appear to go "up" to the left) or ''z&amp;#8209;twist'' (to the right). For a single ply yarn, the direction of the final twist is the same as its original twist. The twist direction of yarn can affect the final properties of the fabric, and combined use of the two twist directions can nullify skewing in knitted fabric.{{Citation needed|date = June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interweave.com/article/spinning/plying-yarn-resources/|title=How to Ply Yarn the Simple Way with this Expert Guide {{!}} Interweave|date=2016-11-18|work=Interweave|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214201804/http://www.interweave.com/article/spinning/plying-yarn-resources/|archivedate=2016-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanical integrity of yarn is derived from frictional contacts between its composing fibers.  The science behind this was first studied by [[Galileo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warren|first1=Patrick B.|last2=et al|title=Why Clothes Don't Fall Apart: Tension Transmission in Staple Yarns|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|date=13 April 2018|volume=120|issue=15|pages=158001|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.158001|pmid=29756870|url=https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.158001#fulltext|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Filament yarn''' consists of filament fibres (very long continuous fibres) either twisted together or only grouped together. Thicker [[monofilament line|monofilament]]s are typically used for industrial purposes rather than fabric production or decoration. [[Silk]] is a natural filament, and synthetic filament yarns are used to produce silk-like effects.

'''Texturized yarns''' are made by a process of air texturizing filament yarns (sometimes referred to as ''[[taslanizing]]''), which combines multiple filament yarns into a yarn with some of the characteristics of spun yarns.
'''Slub Effect'''  means a yarn with thick and thin sections alternating regularly or irregularly.It was invented by Mr. Rizwanul Karim from Bangladesh.

==Colour==
[[File:Caraz Market Lana.jpg|thumb|right|Yarn comes in many colors]]

Yarn may be used undyed, or may be coloured with [[natural dye|natural]] or artificial [[dye]]s. Most yarns have a single uniform hue, but there is also a wide selection of variegated yarns:

* Heathered or tweed: yarn with flecks of different coloured fibre
* Ombre: variegated yarn with light and dark shades of a single [[hue]]
* Multicolored: variegated yarn with two or more distinct hues (a "parrot colourway" might have green, yellow and red)
* Self-striping: yarn dyed with lengths of colour that will automatically create stripes in a knitted or crocheted object
* Marled: yarn made from strands of different-coloured yarn twisted together, sometimes in closely related hues

[[File:Yarn weight comparison with variegated colours.jpg|thumb|A comparison of yarn weights (thicknesses): the top skein is aran weight, suitable for knitting a thick sweater or hat. The manufacturer's recommended knitting [[Gauge (knitting)|gauge]] appears on the label: 5 to 7 stitches per inch using size 4.5 to 5.1&amp;nbsp;mm needles. The bottom skein is sock weight, specifically for knitting socks. Recommended gauge: 8 to 10 stitches per inch, using size 3.6 to 4.2&amp;nbsp;mm needles.]]

Yarn quantities for handcrafts are usually measured and sold by weight in ounces or grams. Common sizes include 25&amp;nbsp;g, 50&amp;nbsp;g, and 100&amp;nbsp;g skeins. Some companies also primarily measure in ounces with common sizes being three-[[ounce]], four-ounce, six-ounce, and eight-ounce skeins. Textile measurements are taken at a standard temperature and humidity, because fibers can absorb moisture from the air.  The actual length of the yarn contained in a ball or skein can vary due to the inherent heaviness of the fibre and the thickness of the strand; for instance, a 50&amp;nbsp;g skein of lace weight mohair may contain several hundred metres, while a 50&amp;nbsp;g skein of bulky wool may contain only 60 metres.

There are several thicknesses of craft yarn, also referred to as [[YarnWeight|weight]].  This is not to be confused with the measurement and/or weight listed above. The Craft Yarn Council of America is making an effort to promote a standardized industry system for measuring this, numbering the weights from 1 (finest) to 6 (heaviest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yarnstandards.com/weight.html|title=Standards and Guidelines for Crochet and Knitting - Welcome to the Craft Yarn Council|website=www.yarnstandards.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418162310/http://www.yarnstandards.com/weight.html|archivedate=2007-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the names for the various weights of yarn from finest to thickest are called lace, fingering, sport, double-knit (or DK), worsted, aran (or heavy worsted), bulky, and super-bulky.  This naming convention is more descriptive than precise; fibre artists disagree about where on the continuum each lies, and the precise relationships between the sizes.

Another measurement of yarn weight, often used by weavers, is wraps per inch (WPI).  The yarn is wrapped snugly around a ruler and the number of wraps that fit in an inch are counted.

Labels on yarn for handicrafts often include information on [[gauge (knitting)|gauge]], known in the UK as tension, which is a measurement of how many stitches and rows are produced per inch or per cm on a specified size of knitting needle or crochet hook. The proposed standardization uses a four-by-four inch/ten-by-ten cm knitted or crocheted square, with the resultant number of stitches across and rows high made by the suggested tools on the label to determine the gauge.

In Europe, textile engineers often use the unit [[tex (unit)|tex]], which is the weight in grams of a kilometre of yarn, or decitex, which is a finer measurement corresponding to the weight in grams of 10&amp;nbsp;km of yarn.  Many other units have been used over time by different industries.
