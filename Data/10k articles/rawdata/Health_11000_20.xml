In 1900, more than 6,000 people in England were poisoned by [[arsenic]]-tainted beer, with more than 70 of the afflicted dying as a result. The [[food safety]] crisis was caused by arsenic entering the supply chain through impure sugar which had been made with contaminated [[sulphuric acid]]. The illness was prevalent across [[the Midlands]] and [[North West England]], with [[Manchester]] being the most heavily affected.&lt;ref name="Dyer"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The 1900 arsenic poisoning epidemic |journal=Brewing History |year=2009 |last=Dyer |first=Peter |volume=130 |pages=65-85 |url=http://www.breweryhistory.com/journal/archive/130/Arsenic.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2018-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Originally misdiagnosed as [[Alcoholic polyneuropathy|alcoholic neuropathy]], the main epidemic was only recognised after several months.&lt;ref name="Copping"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Death in the beer-glass: the Manchester arsenic-in-beer epidemic of 1900-1 and the long-term poisoning of beer |journal=Brewing History |year=2009 |last=Copping |first=Matthew |volume=132 |pages=31-57 |url=http://www.breweryhistory.com/journal/archive/132/Death_in_a_beerglass.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2018-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, investigation into the outbreak found other sources of arsenic in beer, which had been unknowingly poisoning thousands in decades preceding the outbreak.&lt;ref name=Copping/&gt;&lt;ref name=comission-final/&gt;

==Misdiagnosis and investigation==
This mass poisoning is unusual in that it was not noticed for four months. The doctors, seeing patients who were usually heavy drinkers and who showed muscle weakness and numbness of the hands or feet, initially thought that the patients were suffering from "[[Alcoholic polyneuropathy|alcoholic neuritis]]". Nevertheless, a marked increase in the number of cases was noted, with 41 people succumbing to peripheral neuritis, multiple neuritis or alcoholic neuritis and 66 people perishing from alcoholism in the four months of the outbreak, while the previous seven months revealed only 22.&lt;ref name="groves"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.grovesandwhitnall.co.uk/arsenic-in-the-beer-scandal-1901/ |title=Arsenic In The Beer Scandal 1901 |work=The Groves &amp; Whitnall's Globe Works |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209041524/https://www.grovesandwhitnall.co.uk/arsenic-in-the-beer-scandal-1901/ |archivedate=2018-02-09 |accessdate=2018-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These cases of neuritis were eventually connected to cases of skin discolouration previously thought to be unrelated. [[Ernest Septimus Reynolds|Ernest Reynolds]], the doctor responsible for making the connection, also noted that only one substance would cause these symptoms: arsenic. He also noted that heavy drinkers who drank mainly spirits seemed less affected than beer drinkers. He gathered samples for analysis from the taverns frequented by his patients, which confirmed the presence of arsenic in the beer they consumed.&lt;ref name="Copping"/&gt;

==Source of the poisoning==
Once the breweries affected were identified, investigation as to where the arsenic came from were instituted. It was found that the arsenic was present in [[invert sugar]] provided to the breweries by Bostock &amp; Co. of [[Garston, Liverpool|Garston]]. In order to decrease costs in the tight-margin English beer market, some breweries substituted high-quality [[barley malt]] with low-quality barley malt supplemented with sugar. This practice was somewhat controversial; as part of the [[Pure Beer movement]], an inquiry on the use of brewing substitutes had been called. This inquiry, starting in 1896 and ending in 1899, had concluded that brewing substitutes were not "deleterious materials" under the [[Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875]] and that further legislation was not required.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=Jim|last2=French|first2=Michael|title=The Pure Beer Campaign and Arsenic Poisoning, 1896–1903|journal=Rural History|volume=9|issue=02|year=2008|pages=195|issn=0956-7933|doi=10.1017/S0956793300001576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=French&gt;{{cite book | last1 = French | first1 = Michael|last2=Phillips |first2= Jim | title = Cheated not poisoned? : food regulation in the United Kingdom, 1875-1938 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780719056055 |pp=67-78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This sugar was made by [[acid hydrolysis]] of starch, where starch is heated in the presence of an acid in order to form [[glucose]]. Such a method was not new, and had been employed commercially since at least 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lorenz |first1=K. |last2=Johnson |first2=J.A. |date= 1972 |title= Starch Hydrolysis Under High Temperatures and Pressures. |url=https://www.aaccnet.org/publications/cc/backissues/1972/Documents/chem49_616.pdf |journal=Cereal Chemistry |volume=49 |issue= |pages=616-628 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bostock &amp; Co. used [[sulphuric acid]] to perform the acid hydrolysis. This acid, purchased from Nicholson &amp; Sons, was made from [[pyrite]]s which contained arsenic, which remained in the final product.&lt;ref name=Copping/&gt;

John Nicholson &amp; Sons, of Leeds, had provided sulphuric acid to Bostock &amp; Co. since 1888. For most of the length of the business relationship, the acid provided was free from arsenic. However, in March 1900, Nicholson started supplying unpurified sulphuric acid containing arsenic. This practice continued until November 1900, when the acid was found to be the cause of the outbreak.&lt;ref name=court&gt;{{cite court|litigants= Bostock &amp; Co., Ltd. v. Nicholson &amp; Sons, Ltd.|reporter= LR 1 KB 725|date= 1904}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson claimed that they did not know the nature of Bostock's use of the acid, and that they could have provided arsenic-free acid if requested.&lt;ref name="Dyer"/&gt;

===Alternate sources of arsenic in beer===
Once the main source of the outbreak had been identified as arsenic poisoning, further investigation into arsenic contamination of beer was undertaken. Eventually, it was found that arsenic was also introduced into beer by the malted barley. In the kilning stage of the [[malting process]], the barley humidity content is reduced by drying the grain with the hot vapours of a fire, usually fuelled by [[Petroleum coke|coke]] or [[coal]]. It was found that when arsenic is present in the fuel, it could then be deposited upon the barley before steeping, and therefore would be present in the final product.&lt;ref name=Copping/&gt; Investigation into the outbreak uncovered that most cases of alcoholic neuropathy endemic to Manchester were, in fact, misdiagnosed arsenic poisoning, with this alternate route being responsible for the poisoning of thousands in the years preceding the outbreak.&lt;ref name="Copping"/&gt;&lt;ref name=comission-final/&gt;

====Halifax 1902 beer poisoning====
This method of contamination was deemed responsible for an outbreak in the borough of [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in January and February 1902 where 13-14 cases of arsenic poisoning were noted, with 3 fatalities. The culprit in this case was deemed to be malt dried over gas coke.&lt;ref name="comission-final"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lord Kelvin |authorlink=Lord Kelvin |last2=Hart Dyke |first2=W. |last3=Church |first3=W. S. |last4=Thorpe |first4=T. E. |last5=Cosmo Bonsor |first5=H. |last6=Whitelegge |first6=B.A. |url=https://archive.org/stream/b21353086 |title=Final report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into arsenical poisoning from the consumption of beer and other articles of food or drink |location=London |year=1903 |accessdate=2018-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
After the cause of the poisoning was reported by the media, a considerable reduction in beer consumption was noted in the region.&lt;ref name=Copping/&gt;

The response from the brewing industry was mixed. There was a strong, immediate reaction from some breweries, led by the large Manchester brewery [[Groves and Whitnall]], who went as far as sending out telegrams to all the taverns and inns that had purchased their beer. Breweries disposed of thousands of barrels of beer by dumping them in the city's sewers.&lt;ref name="Dyer"/&gt; Other breweries were slower to respond, with fines being handed out to breweries whose beer samples could still be purchased by investigators. Additionally, one pub was fined for selling contaminated beer after they were notified of the presence of arsenic by the manufacturer.&lt;ref name="Dyer"/&gt;

In [[Lancashire]], 23 taverns and pubs were prosecuted for violations under section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875.&lt;ref name="Dyer"/&gt; 

Bostock &amp; Co. went into liquidation, and sued Nicholson &amp; Sons for damages, for breach of an implied condition under the [[Sale of Goods Act 1893]].  The case was heard by Mr Justice [[Gainsford Bruce|Bruce]] in the High Court: the judge awarded Bostock the price of the contaminated acid and the value of their spoiled products, but no [[special damages]] for the loss of goodwill or for the damages claimed by the brewers, incurred by using the contaminated product in their sugar's manufacture.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt;  Nicholson &amp; Sons survived, and was later acquired by B. Laporte, now [[Laporte plc]].

The poisoning resulted in the appointment of a [[Royal Commission]] led by [[Lord Kelvin]], which submitted a preliminary report in 1901 and a final report in 1903.&lt;ref name="comission-final"/&gt;

==Long-term effects==
The effects on the beer market were short-lived, and consumption of beer resumed over the course of the year.&lt;ref name="Dyer"/&gt; Attempts to revive the pure beer movement were nullified by the Commission's report, and by the fact that arsenic was present in malted barley as well as sugar.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; There seemed to be no direct effects on legislation resulting from the incident.&lt;ref name="Dyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=French/&gt;

In 1901, a considerable decline in the birth rate was noted in Manchester, Salford and Liverpool. This decline was greater in areas most affected, leading the Royal Commission to conclude that the epidemic was the cause.&lt;ref name="comission-final"/&gt;

'''Adam Drummond of Binend''' (1679-1758) was a Scottish surgeon-apothecary who was appointed, jointly, as the first Professor of Anatomy at the [[University of Edinburgh]].

==Early life==
He was the third son of Adam Drummond (1649-1709) of Megginch, 9th of Lennoch, a [[Commissioner to the Scottish Parliament]] and a [[Privy Councillor of Scotland]].&lt;ref name=clan&gt;http://www.clanmacfarlanegenealogy.info/genealogy/TNGWebsite/getperson.php?personID=I38674&amp;tree=CC&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, a prominent Scottish lawyer and politician, was appointed in 1692 as one of the commissioners into the enquiry into the [[massacre of Glencoe]].&lt;ref name=Drummond&gt;Drummond, C.G.''Adam Drummond of Megginch, surgeon-apothecary (1679-1758)'' Medical History; London Vol. 18, Iss. 2,  (Apr 1, 1974): 147.&lt;/ref&gt; His elder brother  [[John Drummond, 10th of Lennoch|John Drummond]] 10th of Lennoch and 3rd of Megginch was Member of Parliament for Perthshire.
Adam Drummond was born on the family estate at [[Megginch]] in Perthshire and  went to the local school in [[Errol, Perth and Kinross|Errol]] before matriculating at [[St. Andrews University]] at the age of sixteen.&lt;ref name=Drummond/&gt; Three years later he became  surgical apprentice to Thomas Edgar who had been Deacon of the [[Incorporation of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] from 1685 to 1687. 
On completion of his apprenticeship he went, as was the custom of the day, for further education at a continental University.  En route to the continent he took a course of anatomy in London from a fellow Scot [[Robert Erskine (doctor)|Dr Robert Erskine]] of Alva, before further studies at the [[University of Leyden]].

==Surgical career==
On his return to Edinburgh, Drummond was admitted to the Incorporation of Surgeons in 1707&lt;ref name="RCSE Fellows list"&gt;List of Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Edinburgh, George Robb, 1874. https://archive.org/stream/b21465812/b21465812_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; and established a practice as a surgeon-apothecary in the [[Lawnmarket]] in Edinburgh.  He was appointed as the joint Professor of Anatomy to the Town’s College (which  became the University of Edinburgh in 1708) to join Robert Eliot, who had been appointed in 1705, was the first to hold that post and was the first Professor of Anatomy in Britain.  In 1720 Drummond resigned "owing to the state of his health and his business",&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. 21st January 1720&lt;/ref&gt; although it is likely that this was as a result of pressure from [[John Monro (surgeon)|John Monro]], who wished to advance the interests of his son Alexander.  One week later the  University appointed [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro ''primus'']] as his successor, paving the way for the famous dynasty of Anatomy professors.&lt;ref&gt;Wright-St Clair R.E. Doctors Monro. Wellcome, London, 1964. p32&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond’s practice as a surgeon-apothecary flourished and he dispensed remedies prescribed by the most eminent physicians of the day. This successful practice attracted many apprentices.

Drummond had been librarian to the Incorporation of Surgeons from 1746 and was [[List of Presidents of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Deacon (President) of the Incorporation]] between 1748 and 1750.&lt;ref name="RCSE Fellows list"/&gt;

==Political allegiance==
The Drummond family were staunch [[Hanovarian (Scotland)|Hanoverians]]. In the [[1745 Jacobite uprising]] the Jacobite army under [[Charles Edward Stuart|Prince Charles Edwart Stuart]] defeated a Government army under the command of [[John Cope (British Army officer)|General Sir John Cope]] at the [[Battle of Prestonpans]]. Among the surgeons from Edinburgh who came to attend the wounded was Colin Simpson, one of Drummond’s apprentices, whose loyalty to the Government was such that he was entrusted to secretly deliver 400 [[guineas]] to Drummond’s nephew, [[Adam Drummond|Captain Adam Drummond]], paymaster to the [[47th Regiment of Foot]], who had been captured after Prestonpans and was being held prisoner at [[Queensberry House]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=Drummond/&gt; Other surgeons who treated the wounded after the battle were [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro ''primus'']], [[Alexander Wood (surgeon)|Alexander Wood]], [[John Rattray (surgeon)|John Rattray]] and George Lauder.

==Family and death==
He married Margaret Spittall in 1710. Their daughter Elizabeth married James Stuart who served three terms of office as [[Lord Provost of Edinburgh]]. Drummond bought a house and estate at Binend in [[Fife]].&lt;ref name=Drummond/&gt; He died in November 1758 and was buried in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]], Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=clan/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7305">The '''African Society of Hypertension (AfSoH) Initiative''' is an international [[organization]] initiative with the objective to create the African Society of Hypertension with a main goal of providing a stable and organized African platform for scientific exchange in [[arterial hypertension]]. The AfSoH Initiative was created in 2010 by the consortium of health professionals and researchers active in field of [[arterial hypertension]] on [[African continent]] led by [[Marc Twagirumukiza]]. The official membership is obtained after registration.

== Meetings ==
The society organizes bi-annual meetings in different African cities&lt;ref&gt;[http://afsoh.com African Society of Hypertension(AfSoH) Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[summer school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afsoh.com Summer School of Hypertension]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research activities==
The AfSoH Initiative areas of research activities are illustrated by the different task forces:
*Task force 1: Mapping the arterial hypertension prevalence on the continent and make predictions for near future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24400">'''Antimicrobial stewardship''' (AMS) is the systematic effort to educate and persuade prescribers of [[antimicrobial]]s to follow [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] prescribing, in order to stem [[antibiotic misuse|antibiotic overuse]], and thus [[antimicrobial resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://animalantibiotics.org/dig-deeper/industry-glossary/|title=Industry Glossary|last=|first=|date=|website=Animal Antibiotics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMS has been an organized effort of [[specialty (medicine)|specialists]] in [[infectious diseases]], both in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics with their respective peer-organizations, [[hospital pharmacy|hospital pharmacists]],  the [[public health]] community and their professional organizations since the late 1990s. It has first been implemented in hospitals. In the U.S., within the context of physicians' prescribing freedom (choice of [[prescription drug]]s), AMS has largely been voluntary [[Self-control|self-regulation]] in the form of policies and appeals to adhere to a prescribing self-discipline. At hospitals, this may take the form of an antimicrobial stewardship program. As of 2014, only the state of California has made this type of AMS mandatory by law. Within the context of commercial and [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] use of antimicrobials, legally mandated AMS has begun with [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] rules that [[triclosan]] be phased out of consumer-grade [[soap]]s due to lack of good evidence that such use improves [[public health]].

==Definition and goals==
The 2007 definition by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) defines AMS as a "set of coordinated strategies to improve the use of antimicrobial medications with the goal to 
* enhance patient health [[outcomes research|outcomes]], 
* reduce [[antibiotic resistance]], and 
* decrease unnecessary costs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shea-online.org/View/ArticleId/9/Guidelines-for-Developing-an-Institutional-Program-to-Enhance-Antimicrobial-Stewardship.aspx |title=Guidelines for Developing an Institutional Program to Enhance Antimicrobial Stewardship |publisher=SHEA |author=Dellit TH |date=1 January 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2013 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525023140/http://www.shea-online.org/View/ArticleId/9/Guidelines-for-Developing-an-Institutional-Program-to-Enhance-Antimicrobial-Stewardship.aspx |archivedate=25 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decreasing the overuse of antimicrobials is expected to serve the following goals:
* improve patient outcomes, especially [[patient safety]] 
* decrease [[adverse drug reaction]]s such as hypersensitivity reactions or kidney or heart damage (e.g., QT prolongation).
* decrease antibiotic-associated disease, such as [[Clostridium difficile infection|''Clostridium difficile''–associated diarrhea]], other [[antibiotic-associated diarrhea]]s, and [[Invasive Candidiasis|invasive candidiasis]]
* guard the patient's [[human microbiota|microbiome]], including the [[gut flora]], respiratory tract flora, [[vaginal flora|urogenital tract flora]], and [[skin flora]] (this is closely related to the preceding goal of preventing antibiotic-associated disease)
* decrease wasted costs
* slow the increase in [[antimicrobial resistance]]
* prevent unforeseen [[environmental degradation]], such as likely adverse effects of altering [[biota (ecology)|biotas]] and animal [[microbiota]]s by pervading the [[water cycle]] with antimicrobials in [[wastewater]]

==History==
Antimicrobial misuse was recognized as early as the 1940s, when [[Alexander Fleming]] remarked on penicillin's decreasing efficacy, because of its [[antibiotic misuse|overuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fleming, Alexander: The Penicillin Finder Assays its Future|journal=The New York Times|date=25 June 1945|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the first systematic assessment of antibiotic use in the [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, Canada general hospital was published: Medical records were reviewed during two non-consecutive four-month periods (medicine, psychiatry, urology, gynecology and surgery, orthopedics, neurosurgery, ear, nose and throat, and ophthalmology). Information was coded on [[punched card]]s using 78 columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruedy|first=J.|journal=Can Med Assoc J|date=1966|volume=95|issue=16|pages=:807–12|title=A method of determining patterns of use of antibacterial drugs.|PMID=5928520|pmc=1935763}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others in 1968 estimated that 50% of antimicrobial use was either unnecessary or inappropriate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reimann|last2=D’Ambola|journal=JAMA|date=1968|volume=205|pages=537|title=Cost of antimicrobial drugs in a hospital.|PMID=5695313|doi=10.1001/jama.205.7.537}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is likely the lower end of the estimate, and continues to be referenced as of 2015.

In the 1970s the first [[clinical pharmacy]] services were established in North American hospitals. The first formal evaluation of antibiotic use in children regarding antibiotic choice, dose and necessity of treatment was undertaken at [[The Children's Hospital of Winnipeg]]. Researchers observed errors in therapy in 30% of medical orders and 63% of surgical orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schollenberg|first=E.|author2=Albritton WL|title=Antibiotic misuse in a pediatric teaching hospital.|journal=Can Med Assoc J|date=1980|volume=122|issue=1|pages=49–52|pmid=
7363195|pmc=1801611}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The most frequent error was unnecessary treatment found in 13% of medical and 45% of surgical orders. The authors stated "Many find it difficult to accept that there are standards against which therapy may be judged."

In the 1980s the antibiotic class of [[cephalosporins]] was introduced, further increasing bacterial resistance. During this decade [[infection control]] programs began to be established in hospitals, which systematically recorded and investigated hospital-acquired infections. Evidence-based treatment guidelines and regulation of antibiotic use surfaced. Australian researchers published the first [[medical guideline]] [[outcomes research]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The term AMS was coined in 1996 by two [[internist]]s at [[Emory University School of Medicine]], John McGowan and Dale Gerding, a specialist on [[C. difficile]]. They suggested "...large-scale, well-controlled trials of antimicrobial use regulation employing sophisticated epidemiologic methods, molecular biological organism typing, and precise resistance mechanism analysis [...] to determine the best methods to prevent and control this problem [antimicrobial resistance] and ensure our optimal antimicrobial use stewardship" and that "...the long-term effects of antimicrobial selection, dosage, and duration of treatment on resistance development should be a part of every antimicrobial treatment decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGowan |first=JE Jr|last2=Gerding |first2=DN |title=Does antibiotic restriction prevent resistance? |journal=New Horizon |date=August 1996 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=370–6 |pmid=8856755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, SHEA and the [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] published guidelines to prevent antimicrobial resistance arguing that "…appropriate antimicrobial stewardship, that includes optimal selection, dose, and duration of treatment, as well as control of antibiotic use, will prevent or slow the emergence of resistance among microorganisms." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shlaes|first=D|title=Guidelines for the prevention of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals.|journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol.|date=April 1997|volume=18|pages=275–91|pmid=9131374|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later, in 2007, bacterial, antiviral and antifungal resistance had risen to such a degree that the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] rang the alarm {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. The same year, IDSA and SHEA published guidelines for developing an AMS program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Clin Infect Dis|date=2007|volume=44|pages=159–177|pmid=17173212|title=Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America guidelines for developing an institutional program to enhance antimicrobial stewardship.|doi=10.1086/510393 | last1 = Dellit | first1 = TH | last2 = Owens | first2 = RC | last3 = McGowan | first3 = JE Jr | last4 = Gerding | first4 = DN | last5 = Weinstein | first5 = RA | last6 = Burke | first6 = JP | last7 = Huskins | first7 = WC | last8 = Paterson | first8 = DL | last9 = Fishman | first9 = NO | last10 = Carpenter | first10 = CF | last11 = Brennan | first11 = PJ | last12 = Billeter | first12 = M | last13 = Hooton | first13 = TM}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2007, the first pediatric publication used the term AMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=SJ|author2=Larson EL |author3=Kubin CJ |author4=Saiman L |title= A review of antimicrobial control strategies in hospitalized and ambulatory pediatric populations|journal=Pediatr Infect Dis J|date=June 2007|volume=26|issue=6|pages=531–7|pmid=17529873 |doi=10.1097/inf.0b013e3180593170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of pediatric infectious disease consultants in 2008 by the Emerging Infectious Disease Network revealed that only 45 (33%) respondents had an AMS program, mostly from before 2000, and another 25 (18%) planned an ASP (data unpublished).

In 2012, the SHEA, IDSA and PIDS published a joint policy statement on AMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Infect Ctrl Hosp Epidemiol|date=April 2012|volume=33|author1=Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America |author2=Infectious Diseases Society of America |author3=Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society. |title=Policy statement on antimicrobial stewardship by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS).|pmid=22418625|doi=10.1086/665010|pages=322–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC's NHSN has been monitoring antimicrobial use and resistance in hospitals that volunteer to provide data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=HICPAC|title=Updates on NHSN Monitoring of Antimicrobial Use and Resistance|url=http://www.cste.org/resource/dynamic/forums/20130319_111419_15786.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2014|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the CDC recommended, that all US hospitals have an antibiotic stewardship program.&lt;ref name=cdc14&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Loria A. Pollack, Arjun Srinivasan|title=Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|journal=Clin Infect Dis|date=2014|volume=59|issue=suppl 3|pages=S97-S100|doi=10.1093/cid/ciu542|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/suppl_3/S97.full|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Joint Commission]] has approved regulations which go into effect January 1, 2017 detailing that hospitals should have an Antimicrobial Stewardship team consisting of Infection preventionist(s), Pharmacist(s), and a Practitioner to write protocols and develop projects focused on the appropriate use of antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/6/New_Antimicrobial_Stewardship_Standard.pdf |title=New Antimicrobial Stewardship Standard |author=Joint Commission |date=July 2016 |volume=36 |issue=7 |work=Joint Commission Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
AMS is needed wherever antimicrobials are prescribed in human medicine, namely in hospitals, outpatient clinics, and long term care institutions, including hospice.

Guidelines for prudent or judicious use in veterinary medicine have been developed by the Canadian Veterinary Medicine Association in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CVMA Prudent Use Guidelines 2008 for beef cattle, dairy cattle, poultry, and swine|url=http://www.canadianveterinarians.net/documents/canadian-veterinary-medical-association-antimicrobial-prudent-use-guidelines-2008-for-beef-cattle-dairy-cattle-poultry-and-swine.|author=CVMA|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular problem is that veterinarians are both prescribers and dispensers. Regulators and the veterinary community in the European Union have been discussing the separation of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Vet. Rec.|title=Federation of Veterinarians of Europe (FVE) concerned about separating antimicrobial prescribing and supply|date=December 2012|volume =15|issue=171(24)|page=609| doi=10.1136/vr.e8348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==

Antimicrobial stewardship focuses on prescribers, be it [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], [[nurse practitioner]], on the prescription and the microorganism, if any. At a hospital, AMS can be organized in the form of an AMS committee that meets monthly. The day-to-day work is done by a core group, usually an infectious disease physician, who may or may not serve in hospital epidemiology and infection control, or/ and a pharmacist, ideally but rarely aided by an information technologist. The entire committee may include physician representatives, who are top antimicrobial prescribers such as physicians in [[intensive care medicine]], [[Hematology]] -[[Oncology]], [[cystic fibrosis]] clinicians or [[hospitalist]]s, a [[microbiologist]], a [[quality management|quality improvement (QI)]] specialist, and a representative from hospital administration.

For an AMS program to be established the institution has to recognize its value. In the US it has become customary to present a [[business plan]] to the executive officers of the hospital administration.

==Program components==
As of 2014, thirteen internet-based institutional ASP resources in US academic medical centers had been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Timothy P. Gauthier |author2=Evan Lantz |author3=Alexander Heyliger |author4=Sarah M. Francis |author5=Laura Smith |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/11/07/cid.cit705.full#ref-1|title= Internet-Based Institutional Antimicrobial Stewardship Program Resources in Leading US Academic Medical Centers|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year= 2014|volume= 58|issue= 3|pages= 445–446| doi= 10.1093/cid/cit705 |pmid=24170198}}&lt;/ref&gt; An AMS program has the following tasks, in line with [[quality improvement]] theory:

=== Baseline assessment=== 
Parts of the baseline assessment are to:
*Measure baseline antimicrobial use, dosing, duration, costs and use patterns.
*Study type of microbial isolates, susceptibilities, and trends thereof
*Identify clinician indications for prescriptions.
In hospitals and clinics using electronic medical records, information technology resources are crucial to hone in on these questions. As of 2015, commercial computer surveillance software programs for microbiology and antimicrobial administrations appear to outnumber "homegrown" institutional programs, and include, but are not limited to TREAT Steward, TheraDoc, Sentri7, and Vigilanz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prevalence and Characteristics of Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs at Freestanding Children’s Hospitals in the United States.|author=Jason G. Newland| author2=Jeffrey S. Gerber |author3=Scott J. Weissman |author4=Samir S. Shah |author5=Chelsea Turgeon |author6=Erin B. Hedican |author7=Cary Thurm |author8=Matt Hall |author9=Joshua Courter |author10=Thomas V. Brogan |author11=Holly Maples |author12=Brian R. Lee |author13=Adam L. Hersh|journal=Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology|volume= 35|issue= 3|date=March 2014| pages= 265–271|pmid= 24521592|doi= 10.1086/675277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals of desirable antimicrobial use=== 
For the desired antimicrobial use, goals need to be formulated:
*Define "appropriate", rational antimicrobial use for the institution, individual patient units, and define empiric treatment versus culture-directed antimicrobial treatment.
*Establish treatment guidelines for clinical syndromes. These can be disseminated in the form of memos, in-services or grand rounds and may be most effective in the form of decision making tools at the point of ordering the prescription.

===Interventions on antimicrobial prescribing===
The actual interventions on antimicrobial prescribing consist of numerous elements

===Provide feedback, continuing education===
*Survey prescriber knowledge about antibiotics, antifungal or antiviral drugs.
*Provide targeted education about particular antibiotics, or one specific antimicrobial at a time, as well as empiric treatment for syndromes versus culture directed treatment.
*Assist in making duration more visible to prescribers. Some institutions use automatic stop orders.
*Decreasing diagnostic uncertainty by appropriate testing, including rapid diagnostic methods. The most effective strategy to decrease diagnostic uncertainty would be to align the focus with other safety projects, and QI measures (e.g. blood management, adverse effects etc.).

Biomerieux has published case studies of countries that introduced AMS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomerieux-diagnostics.com/sites/clinic/files/be_smart_newsletter_n6.pdf Be SMART with Resistance], Biomerieux, Intern. Newsletter October 2013, 8 pp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interventions==
The day-to-day work of the core AMS members is to screen patients' [[medical records]] for some of the following questions, in order of importance:
*Appropriate antimicrobial choice based on susceptibility, avoiding redundance ?
*Appropriate dose (mg/kg dosing in children) ?
*Appropriate dosing interval according to age, weight and renal function or [[drug-drug interaction]]? 
*Appropriate deescalation of antimicrobials after culture results are final ?
*Appropriate administration route and feasibility of drug conversion from intravenous to by mouth (PO)? 
 
If the answer is no, the team needs to effectively communicate a recommendation, which may be in person or in the medical record.

Further tasks are:
*Automatic review of the medical record after 72h empiric use, culture results, other laboratory data 
*Advise on appropriate duration of antimicrobial therapy
*Annual report to administration, calculation of cost savings if any.

==Outcomes to measure==
Two pediatric infectious disease physicians have suggested to look at the following variables to judge the outcome of AMS interventions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newland|first=Jason|author2=Adam Hersh|journal=Pediatr Infect Dis J |date=2010|volume=29|pages=862–863.|title=Purpose and design of antimicrobial stewardship programs in pediatrics.|doi=10.1097/INF.0b013e3181ef2507|pmid=20720473}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Annual pharmacy acquisition costs 
* Antibiotic days/1,000 patient days 
* Identifying "drug-bug mismatches"
* IV to oral conversion
* Optimal dosing 
* Stopping redundant therapy
* Reducing adverse events
* Overall compliance with ASP recommendations
When examining the relationship between an outcome and an intervention, the epidemiological method of [[time series analysis]] is preferred, because it accounts for the dependence between time points.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
A recent global stewardship survey identified barriers to the initiation, development and implementation of stewardship programmes internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Howard P. et al., ESCMID Study Group for Antimicrobial Policies (ESGAP) &amp; ISC. Group on Antimicrobial Stewardship ECCMID 2013, Berlin Presentation Nr. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
*At this time the optimal metrics to benchmark antimicrobial use are still controversial.  
*To measure unit of antimicrobials consumed, one can use 'Days Of Therapy' (DOT) or [[Defined Daily Dose]] (DDD). The former is more commonly used in the US, the latter is more commonly used in Europe.
*Data source for the use: The electronic medication administration record (eMAR) is the most accurate correlate for doses given, but may be difficult to analyze, because of hold orders and patient refusal, as opposed to administrative or billing data, that may be easier to obtain.
*The question of "appropriateness of use" is probably the most controversial. Appropriate use depends on the local antimicrobial resistance profile and therefore has different regional answers. Merely the "amount" of antibiotics used is no straightforward metric for appropriateness.
*In regard to the most effective AMS intervention, the answer will depend on the size of the institution and the resources available: The system of "prior approval" of antimicrobials by infectious diseases has been used first historically. It is very time- and labor-intensive, and prescribers do not like its restrictive character. Increasingly "post-prescription review" is used. 
*Although education consistently shows improvement in participants' knowledge and attitudes, the results do not always translate to better practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeung|first=Eugene Y.

It can be difficult to decide if a clinical syndrome or a particular drug should be targeted for interventions and education. 
How to best modify prescriber behavior has been the subject of controversy and research. At issue is how feedback is presented to prescribers, individually, in aggregate, with or without peer comparisons, and whether to reward or punish. 
As long as the best quality metrics for an AMS program are unknown, a combination of antimicrobial consumption, antimicrobial resistance, and antimicrobial and drug resistant organism related mortality are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris, Brener S|first=S|journal=Infect Ctrl Hosp Epidemiol|title=Use of a structured panel process to define quality metrics for antimicrobial stewardship programs.|date=2012|volume=33|pages=500–6|pmid=22476277|doi=10.1086/665324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Antonine Plague''' of 165 to 180 AD, also known as the Plague of [[Galen]] (from the name of the Greek physician living in the Roman Empire who described it), was an ancient [[pandemic]] brought back to the [[Roman Empire]] by troops returning from campaigns in the [[Near East]]. Scholars have suspected it to have been either [[smallpox]]&lt;ref&gt;H. Haeser's conclusion, in ''Lehrbuch der Geschichte der Medicin und der epidemischen Krankenheiten'' III:24–33 (1882), followed by Zinsser in 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[measles]],&lt;ref&gt;"There is not enough evidence satisfactorily to identify the disease or diseases" concluded J. F. Gilliam in his summary (1961) of the written sources, with inconclusive Greek and Latin inscriptions, two groups of papyri and coinage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The most recent scientific data have eliminated this possibility. See Y. Furuse, A. Suzuki and H. Oshitani, “Origin of the Measles Virus: Divergence from Rinderpest Virus Between the 11th and 12th Centuries,” Virology 7 (2010), pp. 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt; but the true cause remains undetermined. The epidemic may have claimed the life of a [[Roman emperor]], [[Lucius Verus]], who died in 169 and was the co-regent of [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus]], whose family name, Antoninus, has become associated with the epidemic. The disease broke out again nine years later, according to the Roman historian [[Dio Cassius]] (155–235), causing up to 2,000 deaths a day in Rome, one quarter of those who were affected, giving the disease a mortality rate of about 25%.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, LXXII 14.3–4; his book that would cover the plague under Marcus Aurelius is missing; this later outburst was the greatest of which the historian had knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The total deaths have been estimated at five million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4381924.stm "Past pandemics that ravaged Europe"], BBC News, November 7, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the disease killed as much as one-third of the population in some areas and devastated the Roman army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1996-7/Smith.html Plague in the Ancient World]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ancient sources agree that the epidemic appeared first during the Roman siege of [[Seleucia]] in the winter of 165–166.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sicker,  (2000). "The Struggle over the Euphrates Frontier". ''The Pre-Islamic Middle East.'' (Greenwood) 2000:p.169 {{ISBN|0-275-96890-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] reports that the plague spread to [[Gaul]] and to the legions along the [[Rhine]]. [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] asserts that a large population died throughout the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius XXXI, 6.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rafe de Crespigny]] speculates that the plague may have also broken out in [[Eastern Han]] China before 166, given notices of plagues in [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese records]]. The plague affected [[Roman culture]] and [[Roman literature|literature]], and may have severely affected [[Indo-Roman trade relations]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].

== Epidemiology ==
[[File:Galenosgruppe (Wiener Dioskurides).jpg|thumb|A group of physicians in an image from the [[Vienna Dioscurides]], named after the physician [[Galen]] shown at the top center.]]
In 166, during the epidemic, the Greek physician and writer [[Galen]] traveled from [[Rome]] to his home in [[Asia Minor]].  He returned to Rome in 168 when summoned by the two [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusti]] - the co-emperors [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]]; he was present at the outbreak among troops stationed at [[Aquileia]] in the winter of 168/69. Galen briefly records observations and a description of the epidemic in the treatise ''Methodus Medendi'', and his other references to it are scattered among his voluminous writings. He describes the plague as "great" and of long duration and mentions [[fever]], [[diarrhea]], and [[pharyngitis]], as well as a skin eruption, sometimes dry and sometimes [[pus]]tular, appearing on the ninth day of the illness. The information provided by Galen does not clearly define the nature of the disease, but scholars have generally preferred to diagnose it as smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Frank McLynn|McLynn, Frank]], ''Marcus Aurelius, Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', Vintage Books, London, 2009.{{pageneeded|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William McNeill]]&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, W.H. 1976 ''Plagues and Peoples''. New York Anchor Press. {{ISBN|0-385-11256-4}}{{pageneeded|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that the Antonine Plague and the later [[Plague of Cyprian]] (251–ca. 270) were outbreaks of two different diseases, one of [[smallpox]] and one of [[measles]], not necessarily in that order. The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that people had no previous exposure to either disease, which brought immunity to survivors. Other historians believe that both outbreaks involved smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;D. Ch. Stathakopoulos ''Famine and Pestilence in the late Roman and early Byzantine Empire'' (2007) 95&lt;/ref&gt; The latter view seems more likely to be correct given that molecular estimates place the evolution of measles sometime after 500 AD.&lt;ref name="Furuse2010"&gt;{{cite |author=Furuse Y, Suzuki A, Oshitani H |date=2010|title= Origin of measles virus: divergence from rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th centuries. |journal=Virol J. |issue=52 |volume=7 |url=https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-422X-7-52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
===Culture, literature, the arts===
In their consternation, many turned to the protection offered by [[witchcraft|magic]]. [[Lucian of Samosata]]'s irony-laden account of the charlatan [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]] records a verse of his "which he despatched to all the nations during the pestilence... was to be seen written over doorways everywhere", particularly in the houses that were emptied, Lucian further remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Alexander'', 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The epidemic had drastic social and political effects throughout the Roman Empire: [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] (1776–1831) concluded that "as the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] forms a turning point in so many things, and above all in literature and art, I have no doubt that this crisis was brought about by that plague.... The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted on it by the plague which visited it in the reign of Marcus Aurelius."&lt;ref&gt;Niebuhr, ''Lectures on the history of Rome'' III, Lecture CXXXI (London 1849), quoted by Gilliam 1961:225&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Marcomannic Wars]], Marcus Aurelius wrote his philosophical work '[[Meditations]]'. Passage IX.2 states that even the pestilence around him is less deadly than falsehood, evil behavior, and lack of true understanding. As he lay dying, Marcus uttered the words, "Weep not for me; think rather of the pestilence and the deaths of so many others." [[Edward Gibbon]] (1737–1794) and [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] (1870–1952) assign the Antonine plague less influence than contemporary political and economic trends, respectively.

===Military concerns===
[[File:Marcus Aurelius Sestertius 177 860042.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman coin]] commemorating the victories of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] against the Germanic tribes along the [[Danube]] frontier in the early 170s AD]]
Some direct effects of the contagion stand out. When imperial forces moved east under the command of Emperor Verus after the forces of [[Vologases IV of Parthia]] attacked [[Armenia]], the Romans' defense of the eastern territories was hampered when large numbers of troops succumbed to the disease. According to the 5th-century Spanish writer [[Paulus Orosius]], many towns and villages in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the [[Europe]]an provinces lost all their inhabitants. As the disease swept north to the [[Rhine]], it also infected [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] and [[Gaul|Gallic]] peoples outside the Empire's borders. For a number of years, those northern groups had pressed south in search of more lands to sustain their growing populations. With their ranks thinned by the epidemic, Roman armies were now unable to push the tribes back. From 167 to his death, Marcus Aurelius personally commanded legions near the [[Danube]], trying, with only partial success, to control the advance of Germanic peoples across the river. A major offensive against the [[Marcomanni]] was postponed until 169 because of a shortage of imperial troops.

===Indian Ocean trade and Han China===

Although [[Ge Hong]] was the first [[Traditional Chinese medicine|in China]] to accurately describe the symptoms of smallpox, historian [[Rafe de Crespigny]] muses that the plagues afflicting the [[Eastern Han]] empire of China during the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (r. 146-168) and [[Emperor Ling of Han]] (r. 168–189) - with outbreaks in 151, 161, 171, 173, 179, 182, and 185 - were perhaps connected to the Antonine plague on the western end of [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rafe de Crespigny|de Crespigny, Rafe]]. (2007). ''A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23-220 AD)''. Leiden: Koninklijke Brill, p. 514, {{ISBN|978-90-04-15605-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Crespigny suggests that these plagues led to the rise of the cult [[faith healing]] millenarian movement led by [[Zhang Jue]] (d. 184), who instigated the disastrous [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] (184-205).&lt;ref&gt;[[Rafe de Crespigny|de Crespigny, Rafe]]. (2007). ''A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23-220 AD)''. Leiden: Koninklijke Brill, pp 514-515, {{ISBN|978-90-04-15605-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that "it may be only chance" that the outbreak of the Antonine plague in 166 coincides with [[Sino-Roman relations|the Roman embassy]] of "[[Daqin]]" (i.e. the Roman Empire) landing in [[Jiaozhi]] (northern Vietnam) and visiting the Han court of Emperor Huan, claiming to represent "Andun" (安敦; a transliteration of [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus]] or his predecessor [[Antoninus Pius]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Rafe de Crespigny|de Crespigny, Rafe]]. (2007). ''A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23-220 AD)''. Leiden: Koninklijke Brill, p. 600, {{ISBN|978-90-04-15605-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: [[Edwin Pulleyblank|Pulleyblank, Edwin G.]]: "The Roman Empire as Known to Han China", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 119, No. 1 (1999), pp. 71–79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Hill, John E.

Raoul McLaughlin writes that this event of Roman subjects visiting the Han Chinese court in 166 could have ushered in a new era of Roman Far East trade, yet it was a "harbinger of something much more ominous" instead.&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2010 p59"&gt;Raoul McLaughlin (2010), ''Rome and the Distant East: Trade Routes to the Ancient Lands of Arabia, India, and China'', London &amp; New York: Continuum, {{ISBN|9781847252357}}, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; McLaughlin surmises that the origins of the plague lay in Central Asia, from some unknown and isolated population group, which then spread to the Chinese and Roman worlds.&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2010 p59"/&gt; The plague would kill roughly 10% of the Roman population, as cited by McLaughlin, causing "irreparable" damage to the [[Indo-Roman trade relations|Roman maritime trade]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] as proven by the archaeological record spanning from [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] to [[Indo-Roman relations|India]], as well as significantly decreased [[Roman commerce|Roman commercial]] activity in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2010 p59-60"&gt;Raoul McLaughlin (2010), ''Rome and the Distant East: Trade Routes to the Ancient Lands of Arabia, India, and China'', London &amp; New York: Continuum, {{ISBN|9781847252357}}, p. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as evidenced by the 3rd-century ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' and the 6th-century ''[[Christian Topography]]'' by [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], Roman maritime trade into the Indian Ocean, particularly [[History of silk|the silk]] and [[spice trade]], certainly did not cease and continued up until the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|loss of Egypt]] to the [[Rashidun Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Yule|Yule, Henry]] (1915).

'''Bobbie Berkowitz''' is an American professor of [[nursing]] and dean [[emeritus]] of the School of Nursing at [[Columbia University]]. She is best known for her contributions improving [[public health nursing]] and [[health systems]] with a focus on [[health disparity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nursing.columbia.edu/bobbie-berkowitz-named-school-nursings-new-dean |title=Bobbie Berkowitz Named School of Nursing's New Dean |last= |first= |publisher=Columbia University |date=2010 |website=Columbia University |access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/ivydiversity |title=The Look of Leadership in the Ivy League |last=Myers |first=Justin |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=2013-06-09 |website=The Chronicle of Higher Education |access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://son.rochester.edu/newsroom/2017/commencement-speaker.html |title=UR School of Nursing Commencement Speaker Announced |last= |first= |publisher=University of Rochester |date=2017 |website=University of Rochester |access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://president.columbia.edu/berkowitz-leaving |title=Bobbie Berkowitz, Dean of the School of Nursing, to Step Down Aug. 31 |last=Bollinger |first=Lee |publisher=Columbia University |date=2018-01-25 |website=Columbia University |access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkowitz earned her BS (1972) in [[nursing]] and her MS (1981) in nursing at [[University of Washington]], and she earned her doctorate in 1990 from [[Case Western Reserve University]].

Prior to joining [[Columbia University]] as Senior Vice President and Dean of Nursing in 2010, Berkowitz was a Professor at [[University of Washington]] and Deputy Secretary of the [[Washington State Department of Health]].

At [[Columbia University]], Berkowitz was instrumental in the creation of a new facility to house the School of Nursing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2013-10-25 |title=Columbia nursing students wil get their tuition's worth from this state-of-the-art building  |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2013/10/24/columbia-university-nursing-school-to.html |work=New York Business Journal |access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; that included the signature "Building the Future Gala" in honor of the 125th anniversary of the founding of the School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last= |first= |date=2017-10-18 |title=Columbia Nursing “Building the Future” Gala Celebrates 125 Years of Nursing Excellence  |url=https://newswise.com/articles/columbia-nursing-building-the-future-gala-celebrates-125-years-of-nursing-excellence |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University |access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of her efforts to strengthen [[healthcare systems]], Berkowitz spoke against recommendations by the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] and advocated for the role of the [[advanced practice registered nurse]] sharing, "There's a lot of research that [[nurse practitioners]] provide as good care if not better care than [[physicians]] in some cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pittman |first=David |date=2012-09-19 |title=Independent NPs Must Go, AAFP Says |url=https://www.medpagetoday.com/nursing/nursing/34843 |work=MEDPAGE Today |access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2016, [[Columbia University]] opened a [[nurse practitioner]] [[primary care]] facility in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krisel |first=Brendan |date=2016-09-16 |title=Columbia Opens Nurse-led Medical Facility in Washington Heights  |url=https://patch.com/new-york/washington-heights-inwood/columbia-opens-nurse-led-medical-facility-washington-heights |work=Washington Heights Patch |access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Berkowitz was inducted into the [[National Academy of Medicine]]. From 2014-2016, Berkowitz served as President of the [[American Academy of Nursing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nursing.columbia.edu/dean-columbia-nursing-named-president-elect-american-academy-nursing |title=Dean of Columbia Nursing Named President-Elect of The American Academy of Nursing |last= |first= |publisher=Columbia University |date=2012 |website=Columbia University |access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bristol stool scale''' is a diagnostic [[medicine|medical]] tool designed to classify the form of [[human feces|human faeces]] into seven categories.

It was developed at the [[Bristol Royal Infirmary]] as a clinical assessment tool in 1997, and is widely used as a research tool to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for various diseases of the bowel, as well as a clinical communication aid;&lt;ref name="Elsevier Health Sciences"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ackley|first1=Betty J.|last2=Ladwig|first2=Gail B.|title=Nursing Diagnosis Handbook, An Evidence-Based Guide to Planning Care, 10: Nursing Diagnosis Handbook|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323085496|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bristol scale stool form. A still valid help in medical practice and clinical research
G Riegler, I Esposito – ''Techniques in coloproctology'', 2001 – Springer&lt;/ref&gt; including being part of the diagnostic triad for [[irritable bowel syndrome]].&lt;ref name=NICE-IBS-2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=National Collaborating Centre for Nursing and Supportive Care|first1=(UK)|title=Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Adults: Diagnosis and Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Primary Care, NICE Clinical Guidelines, No. 61|date=February 2008|pmid=21656972|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0009973/|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation of the scale ==
The seven types of stool are:&lt;ref name="Mínguez Pérez-2009"/&gt;

*Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)
*Type 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy
*Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface
*Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft
*Type 5: Soft blobs with clear cut edges (easy to pass)
*Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool
*Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid

Types 1 and 2 indicate [[constipation]], with 4 being the ideal stools as they are easy to [[defecation|defecate]] while not containing excess liquid, 5 tending towards &lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE SPELLING OF DIARRHOEA, THE BRISTOL STOOL SCALE ORIGINATED IN BRITAIN AND SHOULD THEREFORE ADOPT THE BRITISH SPELLING - SEE WP:ENGVAR --&gt;[[diarrhea|diarrhoea]], and 6 and 7 indicate diarrhoea.&lt;ref name="LacyPatel2017"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Lacy BE, Patel NK| title=Rome Criteria and a Diagnostic Approach to Irritable Bowel Syndrome. | journal=J Clin Med | year= 2017 | volume= 6 | issue= 11 | pages=  99| pmid=29072609 | doi=10.3390/jcm6110099 | pmc=5704116 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the initial study, in the population examined in this scale, the type 1 and 2 stools were more prevalent in females, while the type 5 and 6 stools were more prevalent in males; furthermore, 80% of subjects who reported [[rectal tenesmus]] (urgency to defecate) had type 7. These and other data have allowed the scale to be validated.&lt;ref name="Mínguez Pérez-2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mínguez Pérez|first1=M.|first2=A.|last2=Benages Martínez|title=The Bristol scale - a useful system to assess stool form?|journal=Rev Esp Enferm Dig|volume=101|issue=5|pages=305–11|date=May 2009|pmid=19527075|doi=10.4321/s1130-01082009000500001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bristol stool scale is also very sensitive to changes in intestinal transit time caused by medications, such as [[diarrhea|antidiarrhoeal]] [[loperamide]] or [[senna glycoside|senna]], [[anthraquinone]] substance with [[laxative]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=SJ.|first2=KW.|last2=Heaton|title=Stool form scale as a useful guide to intestinal transit time|journal=Scand J Gastroenterol|volume=32|issue=9|pages=920–4|date=September 1997|doi=10.3109/00365529709011203|pmid=9299672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Developed and proposed for the first time in [[England]] by Dr. Stephen Lewis and Dr. Ken Heaton at the University Department of Medicine, [[Bristol Royal Infirmary]], it was suggested by the authors as a clinical assessment tool in 1997 in the journal ''[[Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology]]''&lt;ref name="Lewis-1997"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lewis SJ, Heaton KW|title=Stool form scale as a useful guide to intestinal transit time|journal=Scand. J. Gastroenterol.|volume=32|issue=9|pages=920–4|date=September 1997|doi=10.3109/00365529709011203|pmid=9299672}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a previous [[prospective cohort study|prospective study]], conducted in 1992 on a [[sampling (statistics)|sample]] of the population (838 men and 1,059 women), had shown an unexpected [[prevalence]] of [[defecation]] disorders related to the shape and type of stool.&lt;ref name="Heaton-1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heaton|first1=KW.|first2=J.|last2=Radvan|first3=H.|last3=Cripps|first4=RA.|last4=Mountford|first5=FE.|last5=Braddon|first6=AO.|last6=Hughes|title=Defecation frequency and timing, and stool form in the general population: a prospective study|journal=Gut|volume=33|issue=6|pages=818–24|date=June 1992|pmid=1624166|doi=10.1136/gut.33.6.818|pmc=1379343}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the former paper concluded that the form of the stool is a useful surrogate measure of [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] transit time. That conclusion has since been challenged as having limited validity for Types 1 and 2;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rao SS, Camilleri M, Hasler WL, Maurer AH, Parkman HP, Saad R, Scott MS, Simren M, Soffer E, Szarka L|title=Evaluation of gastrointestinal transit in clinical practice: position paper of the American and European Neurogastroenterology and Motility Societies|journal=Neurogastroenterol.

=== Diagnosis of IBS ===
{{see also|irritable bowel syndrome|Rome process}}
Patients with [[irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]] or irritable bowel syndrome typically report that they suffer with abdominal [[cramp]]s and [[constipation]].
In some patients, chronic constipation is interspersed with brief episodes of [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]]; while a minority of patients with IBS have only diarrhoea.
The presentation of symptoms is usually months or years and commonly patients consult different doctors, without great success, and doing various specialized investigations.
It notices a strong correlation of the reported symptoms with [[stress (biology)|stress]]; indeed diarrhoeal discharges are associated with [[emotion|emotional phenomena]].
IBS blood is present only if the disease is associated with [[hemorrhoid|haemorrhoid]]s.&lt;ref name="Longstreth-2006"/&gt;

The research results (see table) indicate that about 1 in 5 people have a slow transit (type 1 and 2 stools), while 1 in 12 has an accelerated transit (type 5 and 6 stools). Moreover, the nature of the stool is affected by age, sex, [[body mass index]], whether or not they had [[cholecystectomy]] and possible [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] components ([[somatization|somatisation]]); there were no effects from factors such as [[smoking]], [[alcoholism|alcohol]], the level of education, a history of [[appendectomy]] or familiarity with gastrointestinal diseases, civil state, or the use of [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptive]]s.

=== Therapeutic evaluation ===
Several investigations correlate the Bristol stool scale in response to medications or therapies, in fact, in one study was also used to titrate the dose more finely than one drug ([[colestyramine]]) in subjects with [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]] and faecal incontinence.&lt;ref name="Remes-Troche-2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Remes-Troche|first1=JM.|first2=R.|last2=Ozturk|first3=C.|last3=Philips|first4=M.|last4=Stessman|first5=SS.|last5=Rao|title=Cholestyramine--a useful adjunct for the treatment of patients with fecal incontinence|journal=Int J Colorectal Dis|volume=23|issue=2|pages=189–94|date=February 2008|doi=10.1007/s00384-007-0391-y|pmid=17938939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cand.med.vet''' ({{lang|la|Candidatus/candidata|italic=no}} (male/female) {{lang|la|medicinae veterinariae|italic=no}}) or "candidate of veterinary medicine" is an academic degree awarded in [[Scandinavia]]n countries following a 5,5 to 6 year veterinary medical school education. It is equivalent with the same kind of degrees given in other countries, like: DVM, VDM, BVSc, BVM&amp;S etc., which also opens for authorization as a veterinarian.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Awarding institutions==
In [[Norway]] the degree is given by NMBU (former NVH) located in Campus Adamstuen in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. In [[Denmark]] by the [[University of Copenhagen]], and in [[Sweden]] by the Swedish University of Agricultural sciences, the only educational institutions in the Scandinavian countries to offer the veterinary degree. In Norway the title is one of few academic titles to remain unchanged during the "Quality reform" changes of 2002-2003, along with cand.med (human medicine), cand.psychol (psychology), cand.theol (religious studies).

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Northampton squ.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Northampton Square in front of the main university building]]
City University traces its origin to the Northampton Institute, established in 1852 and named after the [[William Compton, 4th Marquess of Northampton|Marquess of Northampton]] who donated the land on which the institute was built, between [[Northampton Square]] and St John Street in [[Islington]]. The institute was established to provide for the education and welfare of the local population. It was constituted under the City of London Parochial Charities Act (1883), with the objective of "the promotion of the industrial skill, general knowledge, health and well-being of young men and women belonging to the poorer classes".&lt;ref name="CityHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.city.ac.uk/aboutcity/history.html|title= Our history – City University London|accessdate= 2008-01-30|publisher= City University, London|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111154506/http://www.city.ac.uk/aboutcity/history.html|archivedate= 11 January 2008|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northampton Polytechnic Institute was an [[institute of technology]] in [[Clerkenwell]], London, founded in 1894. Alumni include [[Colin Cherry]], [[Stuart Davies (engineer)|Stuart Davies]] and [[Anthony Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senatehouselibrary.ac.uk/our-collections/historic-collections/archives-manuscripts/university-of-london-student-records-1836-1931/ |title=University of London Students 1836-1933 |publisher=Senate House Library |date=1930-06-30 |accessdate=2013-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914105055/http://www.shl.lon.ac.uk/specialcollections/archives/studentrecords.shtml |archivedate=14 September 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur George Cocksedge]], a British [[gymnast]] who competed in the [[1920 Summer Olympics]], was a member of the Northampton Polytechnic Institute's Gymnastics Club and was Champion of the United Kingdom in 1920. In 1937 [[Maurice Dennis]] of the (Northampton Polytechnic ABC) was the 1937 [[ABA Middleweight Champion]]. [[Frederick Handley Page]] was a lecturer in [[aeronautics]] at the institute. The [[Handley Page Type A]], the first powered aircraft designed and built by him, ended up as an instructional airframe at the school. The novelist [[Eric Ambler]] studied engineering at the institute.

The six original departments at the institute were Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering; Artistic Crafts; Domestic Economy and Women's Trades; Electro-Chemistry; [[Horology]] (the science of time and art of clock-making); and Mechanical Engineering and Metal Trades.

===20th century===
In 1903–04 a separate technical [[optics]] department was established. In 1909 the first students qualified for [[University of London]] BSc degrees in engineering as internal students.&lt;ref name="CityHistory"/&gt; Since 1909 the institute had been involved in [[aeronautics]] education, and in 2009 the School of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences celebrated the centenary of aeronautics at City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.city.ac.uk/sems/dps/events/programme.pdf|title= 100 years of education in aeronautics|accessdate= 2009-06-15|publisher= Royal Aeronautical Society}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 the Institute was used for the [[1908 Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name="CityHistory"/&gt;  [[Boxing at the 1908 Summer Olympics|Boxing]] took place at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222443/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1908/1908.pdf 1908 Summer Olympics official report.] p 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was designated a "[[College of Advanced Technology (United Kingdom)|College of Advanced Technology]]" in 1957.&lt;ref name="CityHistory"/&gt;

[[File:CollegeBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Grade II listed College Building]]

A new £23 million building to house the School of Social Sciences and the Department of Language and Communication Science was opened in 2004. The reconstruction and redevelopment of the university's [[Grade II listed]] college building (following the fire in 2001) was completed in July 2006.

'''Adhesive dentistry''' is a branch of dentistry which deals with adhesion or bonding to the natural substance of teeth, [[tooth enamel|enamel]] and [[dentin]]. It studies the nature and strength of adhesion to dental hard tissues, properties of adhesive materials, causes and mechanisms of failure of the bonds, clinical techniques for bonding and newer applications for bonding such as bonding to the soft tissue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jad.quintessenz.de/ The Journal of Adhesive Dentistry: Online Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; There's also direct composite bonding which uses tooth-colored [[dental composite|direct dental composites]] to repair various tooth damages such as cracks or gaps.

Dental bonding is a dental procedure in which a dentist applies a tooth-colored [[resin]] material (a durable [[plastic]] material) and cures it with visible, blue light. This ultimately "bonds" the material to the tooth and improves the overall appearance of teeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://authoritydentalblog.com/best-denture-adhesive/ Denture Adhesive]&lt;/ref&gt; Tooth bonding techniques have various clinical applications including operative dentistry and preventive dentistry as well as [[cosmetic dentistry|cosmetic]] and [[pediatric dentistry]], [[prosthodontics]], and [[orthodontics]].

==History==
Adhesive dentistry began in 1955 with a paper by Dr. Michael Buonocore on the benefits of acid etching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdeworld.com/courses/4508-the-history-of-adhesive-bonding |title=The History of Adhesive Bonding |publisher=CDEWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies have changed multiple times since then, with generally recognized generations established in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Ara |last= Nazarian |title=The Progression of Dental Adhesives |url=http://www.aranazariandds.com/pdf/dental_adhesives.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dental bonding agents have evolved from no-etch to total-etch (4th- and 5th-generation) to self-etch (6th- and 7th-generation) systems.&lt;ref&gt;De Munck J, Van Landuyt KL, Peumans M, Poitevin A, Lambrechts P, Braem M, Van Meerbeek B. A critical review of the durability of adhesion to tooth tissue: methods and results. J Dent Res 2005;84:118-132.&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of products improved convenience and reduced sensitivity to operator errors. However, the best bonding and longevity was achieved with 4th generation agents (having separate etch, prime, and bond steps).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ernest CP, Holzmeier M, Willershausen B|title=In vitro shear bond strength of self-etching adhesives in comparison to 4th and 5th generation adhesives.|journal=J Adhes Dent.|date=Winter 2004|volume=6|issue=4|pages=293–9|pmid=15779314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dental bonding agents.jpg|thumb|All in one self-etch adhesive and a single component universal adhesive by Kerr, both used in the adhesion of direct and indirect dental restorations ]]
[[Irwin Smigel]] founder and current president of the [[American Society for Dental Aesthetics]] and diplomat of the American Board of Aesthetic Dentistry, was one of the first to broaden the usage of bonding by using it to close gaps between teeth, lengthen teeth as well as to re-contour the entire mouth rather than using crowns. Having done more extensive work on the process than any other dentist, Dr. Smigel lectures world-wide on aesthetic dentistry. In 1979 he published a guide to aesthetic dentistry entitled “Dental Health/Dental Beauty.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smigel |first=Irwin |title=Dental Health/Dental Beauty |year=1979 |publisher=M. Evans |isbn=978-0-87131-284-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, new dental universal adhesives are commercialized. The universal adhesives bond to all dental substrates, which include enamel, dentin, metal, porcelain, ceramic and zirconia, with a single application. The term “universal” adhesive is not new. In fact, many early bonding agents were named  or described as  “universal” adhesives, such as  XP Bond-Universal Total-etch Adhesive (Dentsply), One-Step-Universal Dental Adhesive (Bisco). However, there is still not a definition of dental “universal adhesive”. It is highly confusing what the term “universal” means. In 2012, the  term “universal adhesive” has several definitions which may include:&lt;ref&gt;Christensen G. New universal adhesives (part I): are they better? Clinicians Report 2012;5(3): 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; a)Can be used in total-etch, self-etch, and selective etch techniques; b)Can be used with light-cure, self-cure, and dual-cure materials (without the separate activators); c)Can be used for both direct and indirect substrates; d)Can bond to all dental substrates, such as dentin, enamel, metal, ceramic, porcelain, and zirconia.

== In Orthodontic treatments ==
Bonding of orthodontic brackets to teeth is crucial to enable effective treatment with fixed appliances. There is no clear evidence on which to make a clinical decision of the type of orthodontic adhesive to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mandall|first=Nicky A.|title=Adhesives for fixed orthodontic brackets|date=2018-04-09|url=http://cochranelibrary-wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002282.pub2/full|work=The Cochrane Library|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd002282.pub2|access-date=2018-06-28|last2=Hickman|first2=Joy|last3=Macfarlane|first3=Tatiana V.|last4=Mattick|first4=Rye CR|last5=Millett|first5=Declan T.|last6=Worthington|first6=Helen V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ectopic testis''' is a [[testicle]] that, although not an [[undescended testicle]], has taken a non-standard path through the body and ended up in an unusual location.

The positions of the ectopic testis may be: in the lower part of the abdomen, front of thigh, femoral canal, skin of penis or behind the scrotum. The testis is usually developed, and accompanied by an indirect inguinal hernia. It may be divorced from the epididymis which may lie in the scrotum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Roger | last1 = Stevenson | first2 = Judith | last2 = Hall | title = Human malformations and related anomalies | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-19-516568-3 | page= 1272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=422903814|title=Ectopic testis|publisher=GP Notebook|accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elisabeth Kübler-Ross''' (July 8, 1926 &amp;ndash; August 24, 2004) was a Swiss-American [[psychiatrist]], a pioneer in [[near-death studies]] and the author of the groundbreaking book ''[[On Death and Dying]]'' (1969), where she first discussed her theory of the five stages of grief, also known as the "[[Kübler-Ross model]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html|title= Milestones |date=Aug 30, 2004  |publisher=TIME | first=Sarah M. | last=Broom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a 2007 inductee into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatwomen.org/women.php?action=viewone&amp;id=222|title= Elisabeth Kübler-Ross|publisher=National Women's Hall of Fame |work=Women of the Hall| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301050227/http://www.greatwomen.org/women.php/?action=viewone&amp;id=222 | archivedate=3 January 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the recipient of nineteen honorary degrees and by July 1982 had taught, in her estimation, 125,000 students in death and dying courses in colleges, seminaries, medical schools, hospitals, and social-work institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"Turn on, tune in, drop dead" by Ron Rosenbaum, ''[[Harper's]]'', July 1982, pages 32-42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, she delivered an [[The Ingersoll Lectures on Human Immortality|Ingersoll Lecture]] at [[Harvard University]] on the theme ''On Death and Dying''.

==Birth and education==
Elisabeth Kübler was born on July 8, 1926, in [[Zürich]], Switzerland, one of [[multiple birth|triplet]]s.  Elisabeth was born fifteen minutes before her identical sister Erika.  Minutes later came her sister Eva.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Laura. [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/329/7466/627.pdf Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]. (2004). ''British Medical Journal, 329 (7466),''  627. Retrieved November 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Her family were Protestant Christians. Her father did not want her to study medicine, but she persisted.  Eventually her father took pride in her career. In an interview she stated: {{quote|In Switzerland I was educated in line with the basic premise: work work work. You are only a valuable human being if you work. This is utterly wrong. Half working, half dancing - that is the right mixture. I myself have danced and played too little.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Elisabeth Kübler-Ross|de.wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During World War II she became involved in refugee relief work in Zürich and later visited [[Majdanek]] death camp. She graduated from the [[University of Zürich]] medical school in 1957.

==Personal life==
In 1958 she married a fellow medical student from America, Emanuel ("Manny") Ross, and moved to the United States. Becoming pregnant disqualified her from a residency in pediatrics, so she took one in psychiatry. After suffering two miscarriages, she had a son, [[Ken Ross (photographer)|Kenneth]], and a daughter, Barbara, in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathreference.com/Ke-Ma/K-bler-Ross-Elisabeth.html Kübler-Ross, Elisabeth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband requested a divorce in 1979.

==Academic career==
Kübler-Ross moved to New York in 1958 to work and continued her studies.

As she began her psychiatric residency, she was appalled by the hospital treatment of patients in the U.S. who were dying. She began giving a series of lectures featuring terminally ill patients, forcing medical students to face people who were dying.

In 1962 she accepted a position at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] School of Medicine. Kübler-Ross completed her training in psychiatry in 1963, and moved to Chicago in 1965. She became an instructor at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]]. She developed there a series of seminars using interviews with terminal patients, which drew both praise and criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kubler-Ross|first=Elizabeth|title=The Wheel of Life|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sometimes questioned the practices of traditional [[psychiatry]] that she observed. She also undertook 39 months of classical [[psychoanalysis]] training in Chicago.

Her extensive work with the dying led to the book ''[[On Death and Dying]]'' in 1969. In it, she proposed the now famous [[Five Stages of Grief]] as a pattern of adjustment: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In general, individuals experience most of these stages when faced with their imminent death. The five stages have since been adopted by many as applying to the survivors of a loved one's death, as well.

==Healing Center==
Kübler-Ross encouraged the [[hospice care]] movement, believing that [[euthanasia]] prevents people from completing their 'unfinished business'{{citation needed|reason=No reference provided|date=November 2014}}.

In 1977 she persuaded her husband to buy forty acres of land in [[Escondido, California]], near San Diego, where she founded "[[Shanti Nilaya]]" (Home of Peace). She intended it as a healing center for the dying and their families. She was also a co-founder of the American Holistic Medical Association.

In the late 1970s, she became interested in [[out-of-body experiences]], [[mediumship]], [[spiritualism]], and other ways of attempting to contact the dead. This led to a scandal connected to the Shanti Nilaya Healing Center, in which she was duped by [[Jay Barham]], founder of the Church of the Facet of the Divinity. Claiming he could [[channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] the spirits of the departed and summon ethereal "entities", he encouraged church members to engage in sexual relations with the "spirits". He may have hired several women to play the parts of female spirits for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074920,00.html Sex, Visitors from the Grave, Psychic Healing: Kubler-Ross Is a Public Storm Center Again] by Karen G. Jackovich. In ''People'', October 29, 1979, page found 2011-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Kubler-Ross' friend Deanna Edwards attended a service to ascertain whether allegations against Barham were true. He was found to be naked and wearing only a turban when Edwards unexpectedly pulled masking tape off the light switch and flipped on the light.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Playboy Interview with Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's' Playboy Magazine, May, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946362-1,00.html TIME.com], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946362-2,00.html ''The Conversion of Kubler-Ross'', TIME, November 12, 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in the Afterworld of Entities'' by Kate Coleman, New West, 30 July 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations on near death experiences==
Kübler-Ross also dealt with the phenomenon of [[near-death experiences]]. She reported on her interviews for the first time in her book "On Death and Dying. What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families "(1969)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_KHpHlsAM4 ''Video: Elisabeth Kübler-Ross über Nahtoderfahrungen (1981) ''], abgerufen am 14. März 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wissenschaft.de/home/-/journal_content/56/12054/62660/ ''Bild der Wissenschaft: Sind Nahtod-Erfahrungen Bilder aus dem Jenseits?''] abgerufen am 16. März 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==AIDS work==
One of her greatest wishes was her plan to build a [[hospice]] for infants and children infected with HIV to give them a last home where they could live until their death, inspired by the aid-project of British doctor [[Cicely Saunders]]. In 1985 she attempted to do this in Virginia, but local residents feared the possibility of infection and blocked the necessary re-zoning. In 1994, she lost her house and possessions to an arson fire that is suspected to have been set by opponents of her AIDS work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinofenster.de/filmeundthemen/neuimkino/archiv_neuimkino/elisabeth_kueblerross_dem_tod_ins_gesicht_sehen_film/ Kinofenster.de] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She conducted many workshops on [[AIDS]] in different parts of the world. In 1990 she moved the Healing Center to her own farm in [[Head Waters, Virginia]], to reduce her extensive traveling.

==Death==
Kübler-Ross suffered a series of strokes in 1995 which left her partially paralyzed on her left side, and the Shanti Nilaya Healing Center closed around that time. She found living in a wheelchair, slowly waiting for death to come, an unbearable suffering, and wished to be able to determine her time of death.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, On life After Death, Foreword by Caroline Myss p.vii. Celestial Arts. {{ISBN|9781587613180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2002 interview with ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', she stated that she was ready for death. She died in 2004 at a nursing home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], and was buried at the Paradise Memorial Gardens Cemetery.

The '''Food Assistance Convention''' is an international treaty relating to [[food aid|food assistance]]. It was adopted on 25 April 2012 in [[London]].&lt;ref name=UN_participants&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/MTDSG/Volume%20II/Chapter%20XIX/XIX-48.en.pdf|title=STATUS AS AT : 13-05-2012 05:13:37 EDT, CHAPTER XIX, COMMODITIES, 48. Food Assistance Convention|publisher=[[United Nations]]|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty aims at "addressing the food and nutritional needs of the most vulnerable populations" and includes mechanisms for information sharing and registration of commitments made towards such assistance.&lt;ref name=UN_text&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/source/signature/2012/CTC_XIX-48.pdf|title=Food Assistance Convention|publisher=[[United Nations]]|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty entered into force on 1 January 2013.

==Background==
The convention is a renegotiated version of the [[Food Aid Convention]], as of 2012 the only legally binding international treaty on food aid. The Food Aid Convention is however only focused on a limited number of food items (expressed in wheat equivalent tons), whereas the Food Assistance Convention is focused on "nutritious food" in general and leaves it up to parties to the convention to state commitments in wheat equivalents or in monetary terms.&lt;ref name=Rural/&gt;

==Negotiations==
The negotiations have taken place in the framework of the present participants of the food aid convention, and there has been criticism that recipient countries and civil society have been left out.&lt;ref name=Rural&gt;{{cite journal|title=Moving from food aid to food assistance|url=http://www.rural-development.de/uploads/media/rural_2011_3_04.pdf|work=Rural 21|author=Constanze von Oppeln-Bronikowski|issue=3|page=32|year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signature and entry into force==
The convention was opened for signature on 11 June until 31 December 2012&lt;ref name=UN_participants/&gt; for 34 states as well as the [[European Union]]. From 2013, it was opened to accession to all states and "customs territories" that did not sign the convention.&lt;ref name=UN_participants/&gt; The convention entered into force on 1 January 2013, as it had been ratified by at least five signatories at that time. As of September 2018, Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, European Union, Finland, France, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, the State of Palestine, Russia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States have become parties to the treaty. The states which have signed but not ratified are Bulgaria, Germany, and Portugal.

In the United States, a '''group purchasing organization''' ('''GPO''') is an entity that is created to leverage the [[purchasing power]] of a group of businesses to obtain discounts from [[Distributor (business)|vendors]] based on the collective buying power of the GPO members.

Many GPOs are funded by administrative fees that are paid by the vendors that GPOs oversee.  Some GPOs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krebs|first1=John|title=Why Group Purchasing Organizations are good for manufacturers and members|url=http://www.fastcasual.com/articles/why-group-purchasing-organizations-are-good-for-manufacturers-and-members/|work=FastCasual.com|publisher=Networld Media Group|date=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are funded by fees paid by the buying members.  Some GPOs are funded by a combination of both of these methods.  These fees can be set as a percentage of the purchase or set as an annual flat rate. Some GPOs set mandatory participation levels for their members, while others are completely voluntary.  Members participate based on their purchasing needs and their level of confidence in what should be competitive pricing negotiated by their GPOs.

Group purchasing is used in many [[industries]] to purchase [[raw material]]s and supplies, but it is common practice in the [[grocery]] industry, [[health care]], [[electronics]], industrial [[manufacturing]] and [[agriculture|agricultural industries]]. As the [[Electric power industry|electrical]] industry has started deregulating, it has also become an increasing trend there. Also, in recent years, group purchasing has begun to take root in the nonprofit community. Group purchasing amongst nonprofits is still relatively new, but is quickly becoming common place as nonprofits aim to find ways to reduce overhead expenses. In the healthcare field, GPOs have most commonly been accessed by acute-care organizations, but non-profit Community Clinics and Health Centers throughout the U.S. have also been engaging in group purchasing.

==History==
The first healthcare GPO was established in 1910 by the Hospital Bureau of New York. For many decades, healthcare GPOs grew slowly in number, to only 10 in 1962.

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] stimulated growth in the number of GPOs to 40 in 1974. That number tripled between 1974 and 1977. The institution of the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) in 1983 focused greater scrutiny on costs and fostered further rapid GPO expansion.  In 1986, Congress granted GPOs in healthcare "Safe Harbor" from federal anti-kickback statutes after successful lobbying efforts.
By 2007, there were hundreds of healthcare GPOs, "affiliates" and cooperatives in the United States that were availing themselves of substantial revenues obtained from vendors in the form of administrative fees, or "remuneration." 96 percent of all acute-care hospitals and 98 percent of all community hospitals held at least one GPO membership. Importantly, 97 percent of all not-for-profit, non-governmental hospitals participated in some form of group purchasing.

With healthcare costs rising sharply in the early 1980s, the federal government revised Medicare from a system of fee-for-service (FFS) payments to PPS, under which hospitals receive a fixed amount for each patient with a given [[diagnosis]]. Other insurers also limited what hospitals could charge. The result was a financial squeeze on hospitals, compelling them to seek new ways to manage their costs.

In specifically exempting GPOs from the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, many healthcare providers interpreted the act as an encouragement to the expansion of GPOs.
Congress did not specify any limit on contract administration fees, but required the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to monitor such fees for possible abuse – particularly with respect to fees in excess of 3.0 percent.

In 1991, HHS promulgated safe harbor regulations, reflecting Congress’ intent to permit contract administration fees and creating the additional safeguard that GPOs inform members of administrative fees in excess of 3.0 percent.  Despite these safeguards, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) published a study in 2002 indicating that GPOs did not always in fact reduce the cost of supplies and equipment for hospitals, but in some cases increased these costs by as much as 37%.  Further examining the practices of GPOs, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) clarified that "safety zone thresholds do not prevent and should not be appropriately read as preventing antitrust challenges to any of the alleged anticompetitive contracting practices..." of GPOs.

In 2002, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee imposed stricter standards on GPOs in healthcare, requiring the adoption of a [http://www.chca.com/mm/pdf/higpa_code_of_conduct.pdf Code of Conduct] to which GPOs must subscribe.

Critics of GPOs charge that, as long as GPOs receive fees from the vendors they are charged with policing, the industry has anti-competitive contracting potential that should be subjected to further scrutiny and/or regulation.

===Vertical-market GPO===

A vertical GPO assists companies and organizations within a specific industry or market segment.

====Healthcare GPO====
A healthcare group purchasing organization (GPO) assists in promoting quality healthcare relief and assists diverse providers in effectively managing expenses. A GPO aggregates the purchasing volume of its members for various goods and services and develops contracts with suppliers through which members may buy at group price and terms if they choose to. GPOs typically provide contracted discounts on medical supplies, nutrition, pharmacy and laboratory. Some of the large GPOs have expanded contract portfolios to also offer discounts on office supplies and non-medical related services.
   
A GPO's earnings come from an "Administrative" fee. GPOs may collect an "Administrative" fee up to 3.0% of all sales volumes from the vendors that they negotiate a contract from, upon selling products to their member hospitals. These fees do not influence the prices negotiated. They are used to cover the GPO's operating expenses.  If there is a remainder it is distributed back to the GPO owners; thus, GPO owners achieve cost-savings on the goods they choose to buy through group contracts, and also receive distributions back from the GPO. General GPO members may also receive some fee share as part of their member agreement, though this practice is no longer typical; thus the primary benefit to a GPO member is the access to deeply discounted pricing.

GPOs submit that their services allow for improved operating margins for healthcare providers, and that members enjoy value added benefits like clinical support, [[benchmarking]] data, [[supply chain]] support and comprehensive portfolios of products and services to address specific needs.

GPOs vary in their strategy for negotiating discounts with suppliers - from requiring that its members not join other GPOs (exclusivity) to requiring compliance to awarding single source contracts. As the healthcare industry becomes saturated with GPOs, pricing is one way for GPOs to bring in new members or convince members of another GPO to switch.

====Foodservice or grocery GPO====
A [[foodservice]] or [[grocery]] GPO focuses exclusively on the $600 billion foodservice marketplace, including food and food-related purchasing for multi-unit foodservice operators, contract negotiation and [[supply chain]] services. 
These negotiations are made with supplier/manufacturing agreements and purchasing contracts. Categories for grocer purchases include: [[poultry]], fresh [[produce]], frozen food products, fresh and frozen meats, [[candy]] and [[snacks]], [[dairy]] and [[bakery]], [[dry goods]], disposables and [[beverages]].

====Industrial manufacturing GPO====
A manufacturer’s GPO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgan|first1=Jamie|title=Prime Advantage Corp.|url=http://manufacturing-today.com/index.php/featured-content/382-prime-advantage-corp|work=Manufacturing Today|publisher=ITP Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeds in solving [[procurement]] and [[Strategic sourcing|sourcing]] concerns by aggregating the demand for products and services used in the manufacturing and [[Production line|production]] process and delivering deep savings on [[raw materials]], services and components by issuing [[Rebate (marketing)|rebates]], [[discounts]], and preferred pricing to its members. 
The combined buying power helps manufacturers save money on their purchases and more effectively compete against the largest global manufacturers.

==== Electrical GPO ====
A GPO in the [[Electric power industry|electrical]] industry attempts to help energy consumers and businesses solve issues with the rising cost of electricity by pooling the electrical demand of multiple consumers, grouping them together, and through this, delivering savings to its members by obtaining more favorable [[Cost of electricity|electrical rates]]. The difference between residential and commercial rates can be quite large in many regions, and are at least 7% cheaper in every US state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.en-powered.com/blog/the-opportunity-of-energy-group-buying|title=The Opportunity of Energy Group-Buying|website=EnPowered|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buying power of the resulting groups allows companies and individuals alike to save greatly on their electrical bills.

====Non-profit GPO====

Non-profit GPOs are similar to regular GPOs, but they are typically made of up a board of non-profit, community-based organizations working together to help lower their costs.

===Horizontal-market GPO===
Whereas a vertical GPO assists organizations in specific industries, such as health care, food service, legal, dairy, and industrial manufacturing, a horizontal GPO assists companies across a broad spectrum of industries.

====Non-strategic, or indirect spend horizontal market GPO====

A horizontal indirect spend GPO succeeds in reducing procurement costs by aggregating the demand for non-strategic, or indirect cost supplies and services used by a broad horizontal market spectrum of member client organizations by consolidating purchasing power and establishing contracts to achieve preferred pricing, terms, and service standards.

The resulting combined buying power helps the usually mid-size and larger member client organizations save money on their purchases of categories such as temporary labor services, office products, safety supplies, office equipment, packaging supplies, uniform &amp; laundry services, pest control, and expedited parcel delivery.  The consolidation of purchasing effort with the GPO also allows member clients savings from reduced staffing overhead costs. According to an analysis by SpendMatters, from an adoption perspective, 15-20% of the Fortune 1000 currently use buying consortiums and 85% of the time, they’re seeing 10%+ of savings in the categories in which they put through a consortium model.&lt;ref&gt;http://spendmatters.com/2011/09/13/new-research-group-purchasing-organizations-gpos-and-consortia-what-you-need-to-know/&lt;/ref&gt;

The suppliers to this type of GPO offer preferred pricing, terms, and service standards because they experience lower overall selling expenses and the increased volume usually associated with the addition of a single very large customer.

'''Health effects''' (or '''health impacts''') are changes in [[health]] resulting from exposure to a source. Health effects are an important consideration in many areas, such as [[hygiene]], [[pollution]] studies, [[occupational safety and health]], [[nutrition]] and [[health sciences]] in general.  Some of the major environmental sources of health effects are [[air pollution]], [[water pollution]], [[soil contamination]], [[noise pollution]] and [[over-illumination]]. 

A non-[[stochastic]] or deterministic health effect has a severity that is dependent on dose and is believed to have a threshold level for which no effect is seen. Stochastic health effects occur by chance, generally occurring without a threshold level of dose, whose [[probability]] is proportional to the dose and whose severity is independent of the dose, such as [[cancer]] and genetic effects. Occasionally, lack of exposure to certain effectors has detrimental consequences on an individual's health. Examples of such effectors include sunlight and exercise.

Unlike the other territories that still remain under British rule, Bermuda does not have [[National health insurance|national healthcare]]. Employers must provide a healthcare plan and pay for up to 50% of the cost for each employee.&lt;ref name="Healthcare"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bermuda Healthcare costs|url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/healthcare.htm|author=Keith Archibald Forbes|website=bermuda-online.org/healthcare|access-date=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare is a mandatory requirement and is expensive, even with the help provided by employers, though no more expensive than that which an employee in the US would typically pay for healthcare when obtained through their employer and the coverage typically far exceeds that which one may have through their employer in the US. There are only a few approved healthcare providers that offer insurance to Bermudians.&lt;ref name="Healthcare"/&gt; In 2016 these were the Bermudan government's Health Insurance Department, three other approved licensed health insurance companies, and three approved health insurance schemes (provided by the Bermudan government for its employees and by two banks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licensed and Approved Health Insurers|url=http://www.bhec.bm/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2016-Website-Notice.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804064956/http://www.bhec.bm/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2016-Website-Notice.pdf|archivedate=4 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary Care==
The Bermuda Medical Specialties Group practice in [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], established in 2018 is one of the largest healthcare centres on the island, with facilities to provide some services which were previously only available in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Mini hospital’ set to open in Hamilton |url=http://www.royalgazette.com/business/article/20180131/mini-hospital-set-to-open-in-hamilton |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=Royal Gazette |date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staffing==
There are no [[paramedic]]s on the island.  The Bermuda Hospitals Board says that they were not vital in Bermuda because of its small size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Call for paramedics to save lives on island |url=http://www.royalgazette.com/drive-for-change/article/20181022/call-for-paramedics-to-save-lives-on-island |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=Royal Gazette |date=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nurse practitioner]]s on the island, of which there are not many, can be granted authority to write prescriptions “under the authority of a medical practitioner”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nurse can write prescriptions |url=http://www.royalgazette.com/health/article/20180925/nurse-can-write-prescriptions |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=Royal Gazette |date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fees==
The [[Bermuda Health Council]] produces a fee schedule for providers of Standard Health Benefit and advises the government on health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Atherden stands her ground on medical scans |url=http://www.royalgazette.com/health/article/20181019/atherden-stands-her-ground-on-medical-scans |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=Royal Gazette |date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coding==
Bermuda uses the [[ICD-9]] diagnostic coding system. It plans, however, to switch to the more comprehensive [[ICD-10]] system to align with the US (which switched in 2015), since Bermudan residents most commonly obtain overseas healthcare there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsletter|work=Newsletter|publisher=Bermuda Health Council|volume=7|issue=1|title=There on the horizon – ICD-10CMs|url=http://www.bhec.bm/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/BHeC-Newsletter-Vol-7-Issue-1-160408.pdf|date=April 2016|accessdate=2 Jan 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102173146/http://www.bhec.bm/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/BHeC-Newsletter-Vol-7-Issue-1-160408.pdf|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bermuda does not have [[Stark Law|Stark laws]], nor do they have self-referral guidelines or anti-kickback laws. The lack of regulation in healthcare, specifically with billing and reimbursement, makes healthcare in Bermuda quite lucrative for physicians and owners of medical/healthcare practices.

The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against the company and its owner, leading to the product being discontinued and a fine paid.

On or about November 21, 2006, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) filed a complaint against Sunny Health Nutrition Technology &amp; Products, Inc. and its owner, Sunny Sia, charging the defendants with making false and unsubstantiated claims for HeightMax Concentrate and HeightMax Plus, as well as for two other supplements, Liposan Ultra Chitosan Fat Blocker and Osteo-Vite.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0623007/index.htm Federal Trade Commission, Plaintiff, v. Sunny Health Nutrition Technology &amp; Products, Inc., and Sunny Sia, Defendants.] (United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida Tampa Division)&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC complaint charged that claims for the pills were unsubstantiated or false and that the defendants invented William Thomson, a supposed expert who appeared in the advertisements. According to the complaint, the advertisements for HeightMax Concentrate and HeightMax Plus misrepresented that:

* HeightMax increases height in users ages 12–25 over what they would achieve without the product; 
* HeightMax causes users to grow an additional 2 to 3 inches in 6 months; 
* Clinical tests prove that: (i) HeightMax increases the height of teenagers and young adults; and (ii) regular use of HeightMax for 6 months causes a 10% to 25% gain in height, and use for more than a year causes a 20% to 35% gain in height; 
* HeightMax increases lean body mass and reduces body fat in users ages 12–25; and 
* William Thomson, an expert with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry, created HeightMax after years of research and [[clinical trial]]s.

The FTC complaint also alleged that the defendants made unsubstantiated or false claims for Liposan Ultra Chitosan Fat Blocker, a [[weight loss]] supplement, and Osteo-Vite, marketed to older consumers for bone-building.

To settle the charges, defendants Sunny Health Nutrition Technology &amp; Products, Inc. and its owner, Sunny Sia, agreed to pay $375,000 in consumer [[redress]]. The settlement also held the defendants potentially liable for $1.9 million in the event that they misrepresented their finances. The order to settle the FTC’s charges requires that claims for any [[dietary supplement]], food, or [[drug]] must be true, non-misleading, and substantiated. In addition, it prohibits the defendants from [[misrepresentation|misrepresenting]] [[Testimonial|endorsements]], including the existence or expertise of any endorser.

On November 30, 2006 the Honorable Susan C. Bucklew, Federal District Court Judge, signed a Stipulated Judgment requiring defendants to pay $375,000 based on the accuracy of sworn financial statements. The Judgment included an avalanche clause, requiring payment of full redress for $1.9 million if the financial statements were not accurate.

On April 24, 2007, the FTC announced that the defendants shall be required to pay the full $1.9 Million after hidden assets were discovered. In the settlement, the $1.6 million balance of the judgment had been suspended based on sworn financial disclosure documents showing inability to pay. Shortly after that settlement, the FTC discovered that the defendants kept at least $1.8 million in an undisclosed [[PayPal]] account. The FTC immediately obtained a temporary [[restraining order]] to freeze the funds, which was granted on December 8, 2006. The defendants were ordered to pay the entire $1.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/2007/04/070424stip0623007.pdf "Federal Trade Commission versus Sunny Health Nutrition Technology &amp; Products, Inc."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2007/04/27/Makers-of-HeightMax-ordered-to-pay-1.9m "Makers of HeightMax ordered to pay $1.9m"] NutraIngredients-USA 26 April 2007. Accessed October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Bucklew’s new order, signed on February 22, 2007, and agreed to by the defendants, required them to pay the entire $1.9 million, using the funds in the account at PayPal and other sources if necessary. The conduct prohibitions from the previously entered order remain unchanged. The FTC set up a refund program for HeightMax purchasers, using the money collected.

The '''immigrant paradox''' is that recent [[Immigrant generations|immigrants]] often outperform more established immigrants and non-immigrants on a number of health-, education-, and conduct- or crime-related outcomes, despite the numerous barriers they face to successful social integration.&lt;ref&gt;

According to the UN, the number of first-generation [[Immigration|immigrants worldwide]] is 244&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates15.shtml|title=United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These large-scale population changes worldwide have led many scholars, across fields, to study the [[acculturation]] and adjustment of immigrants to their new homes. Specifically, researchers have examined immigrant experiences as they pertain to [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]], [[Mental health|mental]] and [[Health|physical]] health, and conduct/crime.

Researchers have tried to understand why later generations seem to perform less well than their forebears. They have found that it can be explained by non-optimal [[methodology]] and differences in the way generations are modified by the host culture.

== Challenges facing immigrants ==
Immigrants face many challenges as a result of migration, stemming from the fact that the nations and communities they settle in are culturally unfamiliar. As a result, they find themselves in an unwelcoming environment lacking in the infrastructure necessary to ensure a simple transition. Additionally, because general attitudes of the host society are often hostile and xenophobic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=S.

Discrimination and prejudice are common and dictate daily experiences with individuals and organizations within the host society. For example, although cultural sensitivity training is increasingly a required component of medical education, immigrants have historically faced and continue to face discrimination in the health care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauderdale|first=Diane S.|last2=Wen|first2=Ming|last3=Jacobs|first3=Elizabeth A.|last4=Kandula|first4=Namratha R.|title=Immigrant Perceptions of Discrimination in Health Care|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00005650-200610000-00005|journal=Medical Care|volume=44|issue=10|pages=914–920|doi=10.1097/01.mlr.0000220829.87073.f7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An added barrier to equitable access to health care comes as a result of many immigrants' limited English proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woloshin|first=Steven|date=1995-03-01|title=Language Barriers in Medicine in the United States|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1995.03520330054037|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=273|issue=9|doi=10.1001/jama.1995.03520330054037|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many health care facilities have inadequate interpretation services, and culturally sensitive health care providers are also scarce. What's more, many immigrants are uninsured,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cis.org/Fact-Sheet/Facts-Immigration-and-Health-Insurance|title=Facts on Immigration and Health Insurance|website=CIS.org|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carrasquillo|first=O|last2=Carrasquillo|first2=A I|last3=Shea|first3=S|date=June 2000|title=Health insurance coverage of immigrants living in the United States: differences by citizenship status and country of origin.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=90|issue=6|pages=917–923|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1446276|pmid=10846509}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the financial burdens of adequate health care insurmountable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Many immigrants also settle in ''de facto'' segregated, low-income neighborhoods and [[ethnic enclave]]s, especially during periods of high immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iceland|first=John|last2=Scopilliti|first2=Melissa|date=2008-02-01|title=Immigrant residential segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas, 1990–2000|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1353/dem.2008.0009|journal=Demography|volume=45|issue=1|pages=79–94|doi=10.1353/dem.2008.0009|issn=0070-3370|pmc=2831378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the benefits of living in such communities include increased social support, positive in-group relations, and the virtual elimination of cultural and language barriers in daily interaction, often such neighborhoods are targets of institutional violence, such as [[Frisking|stop and frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelman|first=Andrew|last2=Fagan|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Kiss|first3=Alex|date=2007-09-01|title=An Analysis of the New York City Police Department's "Stop-and-Frisk" Policy in the Context of Claims of Racial Bias|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1198/016214506000001040|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=102|issue=479|pages=813–823|doi=10.1198/016214506000001040|issn=0162-1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, due to public education funding policies in the United States, funds are often allocated to schools based on neighborhood property taxes. As a result, many immigrant children attend schools that are understaffed, underfunded, and lacking in resources in comparison to the schools of their more affluent peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/02/concentration-poverty-american-schools/471414/|title=Students of Color Are Much More Likely to Attend Schools Where Most of Their Peers Are Poor|last=Brownstein|first=Janie Boschma and Ronald|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/property-taxes-and-unequal-schools/497333/|title=Good School, Rich School; Bad School, Poor School|last=Semuels|first=Alana|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the opportunity gap, by which low-income and marginalized groups have disproportionately low access to the opportunities and conveniences afforded to societally privileged groups, resulting in group-wide disparities in academic achievement, wages, and political power. In direct relation to these obstacles, immigrants also face challenges in the workplace, including poor and dangerous working conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ORRENIUS|first=PIA M.|last2=ZAVODNY|first2=MADELINE|date=August 2009|title=Do Immigrants Work In Riskier Jobs?|journal=Demography|volume=46|issue=3|pages=535–551|issn=0070-3370|pmc=2831347|pmid=19771943}}&lt;/ref&gt; unemployment, and the employment of highly skilled individuals in low-skill jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Jennifer Asanin|last2=Wilson|first2=Kathi|date=2009-04-01|title=‘Education?

To compound all of these issues, the burden of acculturation is an added stressor. Navigating the divide between the heritage culture and the culture of the new society is difficult, as the traditions, beliefs, and norms of these two cultures are often in direct conflict. This challenge is only compounded by the other obstacles immigrants are faced with, and has deleterious consequences for mental health,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sirin|first=Selcuk R.|last2=Ryce|first2=Patrice|last3=Gupta|first3=Taveeshi|last4=Rogers-Sirin|first4=Lauren|title=The role of acculturative stress on mental health symptoms for immigrant adolescents: A longitudinal investigation.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0028398|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=49|issue=4|pages=736–748|doi=10.1037/a0028398}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly because many migrants and refugees are already susceptible to elevated levels of [[psychopathology]], due to the trauma associated with interpersonal conflict, acculturative stress and/or political unrest in their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mobasher|first=Mohsen|date=2016-07-27|title=Cultural Trauma and Ethnic Identity Formation Among Iranian Immigrants in the United States|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764206289656|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=50|issue=1|pages=100–117|doi=10.1177/0002764206289656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaltman|first=Stacey|last2=Green|first2=Bonnie L.|last3=Mete|first3=Mihriye|last4=Shara|first4=Nawar|last5=Miranda|first5=Jeanne|title=Trauma, depression, and comorbid PTSD/depression in a community sample of Latina immigrants.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0018952|journal=Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy|volume=2|issue=1|pages=31–39|doi=10.1037/a0018952|pmc=2850073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steel|first=Zachary|last2=Silove|first2=Derrick|last3=Bird|first3=Kevin|last4=McGorry|first4=Patrick|last5=Mohan|first5=P.|date=1999-07-01|title=Pathways from War Trauma to Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms Among Tamil Asylum Seekers, Refugees, and Immigrants|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024710902534|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|volume=12|issue=3|pages=421–435|doi=10.1023/A:1024710902534|issn=0894-9867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of these obstacles, it is expected that recent immigrants would have outcomes inferior to those of their native-born or non-immigrant peers.

== Paradoxical findings ==
Despite the numerous challenges facing early generation immigrants, research on the mental and physical health, educational, and conduct-related outcomes of these populations has demonstrated a [[paradoxical]] pattern.

=== Mental health outcomes ===
Research with Filipino Americans has demonstrated that first-generation immigrants had lower levels of depressive symptoms than subsequent, US-born generations.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; First-generation Mexican immigrants to the United States were found to have lower incidences of mood disorders and substance use than their bicultural or subsequent generation counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burnam|first=M.

These findings have been replicated outside of the United States, with Canadian researchers finding that foreign born youth are less likely to display emotional and behavioural problems than their native-born peers, despite experiencing similar levels of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beiser|first=Morton|last2=Hou|first2=Feng|last3=Hyman|first3=Ilene|last4=Tousignant|first4=Michel|date=2002-02-01|title=Poverty, Family Process, and the Mental Health of Immigrant Children in Canada|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.92.2.220|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=92|issue=2|pages=220–227|doi=10.2105/AJPH.92.2.220|issn=0090-0036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted in the Netherlands has also found evidence of an immigrant paradox, with first- and second-generation Muslim immigrants reporting fewer psychological problems and higher self-esteem than Dutch nationals.

=== Physical health outcomes ===
The immigrant paradox also extends to physical health, with recent immigrants having better outcomes than US-born individuals. One study of several thousand health records in Southern California found Asian and Latina women had better perinatal outcomes than both white and Black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voelker|first=Rebecca|date=1994-12-21|title=Born in the USA: Infant Health Paradox|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1994.03520230015006|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=272|issue=23|doi=10.1001/jama.1994.03520230015006|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Asian and Latina women had lower infant mortality, higher birth weight, fewer [[Caesarean section]]s, fewer medical diagnoses during delivery, and shorter hospitalizations. This finding has also been replicated in Spain, with immigrant mothers, barring those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n origin, having a lower frequency of low birth weight than native Spanish mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Speciale|first=Anna Maria|last2=Regidor|first2=Enrique|date=2011-06-01|title=Understanding the Universality of the Immigrant Health Paradox: The Spanish Perspective|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10903-010-9365-1|journal=[[Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=518–525|doi=10.1007/s10903-010-9365-1|issn=1557-1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational outcomes ===
Among Latino populations, first- and second-generation Latino adolescents report high levels of effort in school, with effort declining across generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aretakis|first=Maria T.|last2=Ceballo|first2=Rosario|last3=Suarez|first3=Gloria A.|last4=Camacho|first4=Tissyana C.|title=Investigating the immigrant paradox and Latino adolescents’ academic attitudes.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/lat0000031|journal=Journal of Latina/o Psychology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=56–69|doi=10.1037/lat0000031}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also place a greater value upon education, with the same downhill trend being observed.

== A special case: the immigrant paradox in refugees? ==
There is a general consensus that [[refugee]]s are at a particular disadvantage when it comes to successful [[Third country resettlement|resettlement]] in the host society, as the same [[Immigrant paradox#Challenges facing immigrants|challenges]] voluntary immigrants face are generally aggravated for refugees. However, some research has found evidence of a paradox, with refugees at least three times less likely to engage in substance use than non-immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salas-Wright|first=Christopher P.|last2=Vaughn|first2=Michael G.|title=A "refugee paradox" for substance use disorders?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871614009168|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|volume=142|pages=345–349|doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found refugees to Denmark to have a lower likelihood of stroke and breast cancer compared to Danish natives, but higher likelihood of lung cancer, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norredam|first=Marie|last2=Agyemang|first2=Charles|last3=Hoejbjerg Hansen|first3=Oluf K.|last4=Petersen|first4=Jørgen H.|last5=Byberg|first5=Stine|last6=Krasnik|first6=Allan|last7=Kunst|first7=Anton E.|date=2014-08-01|title=Duration of residence and disease occurrence among refugees and family reunited immigrants: test of the ‘healthy migrant effect’ hypothesis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tmi.12340/abstract|journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health|volume=19|issue=8|pages=958–967|doi=10.1111/tmi.12340|issn=1365-3156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, levels of all of these diseases among refugee populations eventually converged to the same levels as Danish natives with increased length of residency.

There may also be an immigrant paradox for the perinatal outcomes of refugees, with the majority of refugee women studied having a lower [[Birth rate|crude birth rate]], infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, and percentage of low birth weight than women in both their host country and their country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hynes|first=Michelle|date=2002-08-07|title=Reproductive Health Indicators and Outcomes Among Refugee and Internally Displaced Persons in Postemergency Phase Camps|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.288.5.595|journal=JAMA|volume=288|issue=5|doi=10.1001/jama.288.5.595|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicting evidence ==
There is some doubt among scholars as to whether or not the phenomenon actually exists, with some findings conflicting with the body of research on immigrant outcomes. For example, among Asian Americans, [[limited English proficiency]] was consistently associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In addition to language proficiency, age at time of immigration is also an important factor, with older first-generation Mexican American youth more likely to drop out of school than their US-born and younger, first-generation counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landale|first=Nancy S.|last2=Oropesa|first2=R.S.|last3=Llanes|first3=Daniel|title=Schooling, Work, and Idleness among Mexican and Non-Latino White Adolescents|url=https://doi.org/10.1006/ssre.1998.0631|journal=Social Science Research|volume=27|issue=4|pages=457–480|doi=10.1006/ssre.1998.0631}}&lt;/ref&gt; In further support of this conclusion, data from the [[Current Population Survey|CPS]] shows that immigrating as a teenager is associated with completing less schooling than immigrating before or after adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiswick|first=Barry R.|last2=DebBurman|first2=Noyna|date=2004-08-01|title=Educational attainment: analysis by immigrant generation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775703001043|journal=Economics of Education Review|series=Special Issue In Honor of Lewis C.

== Explanations ==

=== Acculturation and the erosion of protective factors ===
The most common hypothesis for the immigrant paradox considers recent and first-generation immigrants' comparative access to cultural and social protective factors. Despite being confronted with the many challenges arising from immigration and acculturation, first-generation immigrants have greater social and cultural capital than subsequent generations. These include stronger social networks and highly adaptive cultural practices concerning religion, diet, substance use, and parenting style.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-71943-6_7|title=Latinas/os in the United States: Changing the Face of América|last=Acevedo-Garcia|first=Dolores|last2=Bates|first2=Lisa M.|date=2008|publisher=Springer, Boston, MA|isbn=9780387719412|pages=101–113|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-71943-6_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harker|first=Kathryn|date=2000–2001|title=Immigrant Generation, Assimilation, and Adolescent Psychological Well-Being|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/josf79&amp;div=42&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=uMlrSOoLQo4AAAAA:BVv50TMN4gEYETcl44cdzUNOydpsNfMnlkLWcDcA-hsH2xnZm4f79JrvKr_-F0vj4jzxycA&amp;collection=journals|journal=Social Forces|volume=79|pages=969–1004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers also posit that first-generation immigrants are more likely to place high importance upon academic success due to fear of limited employment opportunities in the host society.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Angel L.|last2=Jamison|first2=Kenneth M.|last3=Trujillo|first3=Monica H.|title=Disparities in the Educational Success of Immigrants: An Assessment of the Immigrant Effect for Asians and Latinos|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0002716208322765|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=620|issue=1|pages=90–114|doi=10.1177/0002716208322765}}&lt;/ref&gt; These protective factors result in superior lifetime health, educational, financial, and conduct-related outcomes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, by having access to multiple cultural frameworks, recent immigrants are able to [[Code-switching|code-switch]] between frameworks or engage in downward [[Social comparison theory|social comparison]] as methods of self-protection.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suárez-Orozco|first=Carola|last2=Carhill|first2=Avary|date=2008-09-01|title=Afterword: New directions in research with immigrant families and their children|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cd.224/abstract|journal=New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development|volume=2008|issue=121|pages=87–104|doi=10.1002/cd.224|issn=1534-8687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, subsequent generations may not have access to such social and cultural capital, having been socialized into the norms and expectations of the host society (i.e., consuming more processed and unhealthy foods, having a smaller network of same-ethnicity peers, increased substance use). Further, intergenerational conflict is more likely between first-generation immigrants and their second-generation children due to differing cultural practices, with parents being accustomed to the norms of their culture of origin and children having been socialized into the norms of the host society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This type of conflict has been linked to poorer outcomes for children.

A third cost of acculturation is linked to immigrant children's cultural [[Socialization#Racial socialization|socialization]]. A strong sense of ethnic identity and pride in one's cultural heritage is generally understood to be protective from negative mental health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mossakowski|first=Krysia N.|date=2003|title=Coping with Perceived Discrimination: Does Ethnic Identity Protect Mental Health?|jstor=1519782|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=44|issue=3|pages=318–331|doi=10.2307/1519782}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with increased length of stay in the host society, subsequent generations are likely to report decreasing levels of involvement in culturally important traditions and practices. With this comes decreasing strength of ethnic identity. Second-generation immigrants are also less likely to endorse meritocratic views, which is similarly correlated with decreasing strength of ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiley|first=Shaun|last2=Deaux|first2=Kay|last3=Hagelskamp|first3=Carolin|title=Born in the USA: How immigrant generation shapes meritocracy and its relation to ethnic identity and collective action.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0027661|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=171–180|doi=10.1037/a0027661}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attributes are all associated with poorer mental health.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffey|first=Thelma|last2=Somody|first2=Catherine|date=2011-07-05|title=The Role of Relational-Cultural Theory in Mental Health Counseling|url=https://doi.org/10.17744/mehc.33.3.c10410226u275647|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|volume=33|issue=3|pages=223–242|doi=10.17744/mehc.33.3.c10410226u275647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Possible benefits of ethnic enclaves ====
:See: [[Hispanic paradox#Barrio advantage|Barrio advantage]]
First-generation immigrants often settle in ethnic enclaves, which carry a host of advantages. Residents of these neighborhoods have access to a strong and supportive network of same-ethnicity peers and potential access to culturally sensitive healthcare providers that may allow for increased financial gain and better physical and mental health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazumdar|first=Sanjoy|last2=Mazumdar|first2=Shampa|last3=Docuyanan|first3=Faye|last4=McLaughlin|first4=Colette Marie|date=|title=Creating a sense of place: the Vietnamese-Americans and Little Saigon|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272494400901701|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=20|issue=4|pages=319–333|doi=10.1006/jevp.2000.0170|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Joshua S.|last2=Kagawa-Singer|first2=Marjorie|date=2007-07-30|title=Increasing Access to Care for Cultural and Linguistic Minorities: Ethnicity-Specific Health Care Organizations and Infrastructure|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/218627|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|volume=18|issue=3|pages=532–549|doi=10.1353/hpu.2007.0073|issn=1548-6869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry R.|first=Chiswick|last2=Miller|first2=Paul W.|date=2005-03-01|title=Do Enclaves Matter in Immigrant Adjustment?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1535-6841.2005.00101.x/abstract|journal=City &amp; Community|volume=4|issue=1|pages=5–35|doi=10.1111/j.1535-6841.2005.00101.x|issn=1540-6040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic enclaves also eliminate the challenges associated with language barriers, with residents often sharing linguistic similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Thomas|last2=Epstein|first2=Gil S.|last3=Gang|first3=Ira N.|date=2005-11-01|title=Enclaves, language, and the location choice of migrants|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-005-0009-z|journal=Journal of Population Economics|volume=18|issue=4|pages=649–662|doi=10.1007/s00148-005-0009-z|issn=0933-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthy immigrant selection ===
Another common explanation for the immigrant paradox is that the vast majority of superior outcomes among early generations of immigrants can be accounted for by a selection effect. Proponents of this hypothesis argue that only the most psychologically and physically healthy individuals migrate from their country of origin, and therefore have superior outcomes to begin with.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Methodological concerns ===
Much of the literature on the immigrant paradox in mental health relies on self-report data. This may be problematic in that certain populations may differentially interpret questions in ways that are meaningful and result in significant disparities between groups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, many measures view mental health solely through a Western lens, accounting only for the types of symptoms commonly expressed in Western societies.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; This may result in the underreporting of poor mental health among non-Western populations.

Another issue in research on immigrants is the grouping of highly diverse ethnic groups together in monolithic racial categories,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; namely the pan-ethnic "Asian" and "Latino" categories. Much of the research on Latinos and the immigrant paradox has been conducted with Mexican American populations, ignoring the fact that there are 32 other countries that fall under the Latin American label. Similarly, much research on Asian Americans has been conducted with [[East Asia]]n populations, ignoring the differential treatment and experiences of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]ns, and the different refugee status of individuals across Asia (examples include [[Bhutanese refugees|Lhotshampa]] refugees, who are of South Asian heritage, and Cambodian refugees, who are of Southeast Asian heritage). Such groupings are problematic in that they erase the large diversity in [[socioeconomic status]], educational background, and historical trauma of each of these ethnic groups – factors which all contribute to the consequent positive or negative outcomes of immigrants.

== Future directions in immigrant research ==
Carola Suárez-Orozco, Ph.D. calls for increased research on the psychology of immigrants paying attention to differences in refugee status, documentation status, gender, and ethnic group (in lieu of using pan-ethnic groupings).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Research must also consider seasonal migrants, the differential [[racialization]] of ethnic groups, and the role of English proficiency on educational and health outcomes.

'''International Aging Research Portfolio''' ('''IARP''') is a [[non-profit]], open-access knowledge management system incorporating [[grant (money)|grants]], publications, conferences in natural and social &amp; behavioral sciences.  In addition to the advanced search and visual trend analysis tools the system includes a directory of research projects classified into categories related to aging research. The system uses automatic classification [[algorithm]]s with elements of [[machine learning]] to assign research projects to the relevant categories. The directory is curated by many expert category editors and science advisory board members. The chair of the science advisory board is Dr. [[Charles Cantor]].

==Background==
[[Aging research]] is a multidisciplinary field spanning many areas of natural and social and behavioral sciences and the research data is widely dispersed. Popular resources like [[Pubmed]] and [[Google Scholar]] provide access to historic as well as most recent scientific abstracts and full text publications. However, few resources exist that incorporate international databases of the scientific publications, scientific grant abstracts and clinical trials databases.

Grant abstracts are usually published by the funding organizations and precede publications in peer-reviewed literature. Some of the experiments described in grant abstracts fail or do not result in peer-reviewed publications. To prevent redundancy and promote scientific cooperation it is important to browse through all available grant information worldwide to see if there are similar projects being funded.

The IARP database integrates information on research grants, peer-reviewed publications, and issued patent applications from multiple sources. Additionally, the database uses flexible project classification mechanisms and tools for analyzing project associations and trends. This system enables scientists to search the centralized project database, to classify and categorize aging projects, and to analyze the funding aspects across multiple research disciplines. The IARP is designed to provide improved allocation and prioritization of scarce research funding, to reduce project overlap and improve scientific collaboration thereby accelerating scientific and medical progress in a rapidly growing area of research.

The IARP system aggregates grant data from many sources including the [[National Institutes of Health|US National Institutes of Health (NIH)]], [[European Commission| European Commission (EC)]], [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]], US [[National Science Foundation]], [[National Health and Medical Research Council|Australian National Health and Medical Health Council]] and publication abstract data through a license of [[MEDLINE]] database. The database is searchable and the results can be presented as charts and graphs for trends analysis. One of the main features of the IARP system is automatic and manual classification of the research projects into a structured directory. The IARP science advisory board and volunteer expert category editors classify the projects from the database into relevant categories. These manually classified projects become training sets for the automatic classification algorithms with elements of machine learning. 
The IARP system is highly modular and portable and may be used as a platform for developing other knowledge management systems for aging research.

==Content==
'''The International Aging Research Portfolio (IARP)''' includes historic grant data from the [[National Institutes of Health| National Institutes of Health(NIH)]], [[European Commission| European Commission(EC)]], [[National Science Foundation|NSF]], Canadian and Australian research councils and many other sources. It also contains [[MEDLINE]] article abstracts under a license from the National Library of Medicine.
The IARP volunteer development team works directly with the publication offices and regularly updates the database either automatically or by parsing the data mailed on physical medium.

==Characteristics==

===Simple searches===

Simple searches on IARP can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into search window.

IARP translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names, [[Boolean operators]], and enhancing the search formulation significantly, in particular by routinely combining (using the OR operator) text words.

:'Programmed Theory Aging'

is translated as

:("Programmed" OR "Theory" OR "Aging")

===Advanced searches===
Advanced Project Search allows users to limit their search criteria, ranging from the date of creation and research and funding mechanism to specific projects. In addition to the description, each research project contains specific information about the funding organization, recipient organization and the [[Principal Investigator|Principal Investigator(s)]]. Moreover, it links the current project with other similar projects and financial mechanisms.

To use the advanced search features effectively, the user must poses some knowledge of the research area and use relevant and specific keywords and limits. The form allows users to specify multiple values for accurate data retrieval.

'''[Keywords]'''.  Users can use [[Boolean operators]] and Mask for finding information in project description and title fields. 
 
Search query examples:

:'nerv*'
:'stem AND cell NOT embryonic'
:'accumulation amyloid alzheimers'

'''[Research Areas]'''. Users can limit their searches by selecting desired research areas from the category tree.

'''[Theories Of Aging]'''. Users can select multiple values from a list of [[Theories of aging|Theories Of Aging]].

In addition, users can limit their search by:

Fiscal Years, Project Number, [[Principal Investigator]]s, Project Start and End dates, Recipient and Funding Organizations,  Funding type.

===Trends and Tools===
Trends Analysis Chart &amp; Tools is a collection of tools for visualizing the project data as diagrams, charts and comparative tables. The interface allows users to create two-dimensional charts comparing research funding by year, institution, university, principal investigator, region and category.

=== Summary statistics ===
Representing a comprehensive analysis of data stored in the system (useful for understanding the content of the database by total number of projects). Displays the current state of the database is stored on publications and projects in detail : total, classified, classified manually, classified as aging, unclassified. Displays the top 50 active, completed projects by total funding, the top countries, US states, investigators, funding bodies and recipient organizations, also by total funding.

=== Other Tools ===
The system also incorporates tools like the Grant Matchmaker, Who is Who and Funding Organizations and Biotechnology Events and Webcasts that are currently in various stages of development. The intent of these tools is to provide the research community with the ability to identify organizations funding similar research projects, identify possible collaborators and find conference relevant to their research interests.

==Data Classification==

=== Automatic Project Classification ===
Automatic project classification is used to identify projects related to aging research within the large data sets and to classify projects into relevant semantic groups. The system utilizes two classification algorithms with elements of machine learning: Support Vector Machine [[Support vector machine|SVM]] and Recurrent-Neural-Network-Based Boolean Factor Analysis (BFA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Alex Zhavoronkov |author2=Charles R. Cantor |title=Methods for Structuring Scientific Knowledge from Many Areas Related to Aging Research |date=2011-07-22 |publisher=[[PLoS ONE]] |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022597}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2014 the SVM algorithm was modified to facilitate for multilabel classification of incompletely-labelled data sets where few labels assigned by the IARP experts are present. This allowed for improved classification accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Anton Kolesov |author2=Dmitry Kamyshenkov |author3=Maria Litovchenko |author4=Elena Smekalova |author5=Alexey Golovizin |author6=Alex Zhavoronkov |title=On Multilabel Classification Methods of Incompletely Labeled Biomedical Text Data |date=2014-01-23 |publisher=Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine |url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2014/781807/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manual Project Classification ===
As current automatic classification algorithms are limited and require each category to have relatively large training sets, the system relies heavily on manual classification by expert category editors. The SAB and Category Editor administrative interface enables  [[Scientific Advisory Group|SAB]] members, institute directors and laboratory heads to curate  the top-level categories and delegate the management of lower-level categories to graduate students.

=== Linking Related Grants and Publications ===
IARP has the ability to automatically identify related and similar projects in database using an algorithm analysis of project abstracts, patents, and publications. This type of advanced project analysis will potentially aid in circumventing project overlap and redundant funding of similar programs while also highlighting knowledge gaps for potential funding.

==Other Resources Using IARP Database==
The FundingTrends project allows for a simple keyword search of millions of biomedical projects supported by major research funding organizations worldwide. It then draws the amount of funding for each year for the projects containing the keywords.

The Aging.CC project allows for a simple keyword search of millions of biomedical projects supported by major research funding organizations worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11028">'''Leo A. Soriano''' (born 10 December 1950) is a [[Bishop]] of the [[United Methodist Church]], elected in 2000 in the [[Philippines]].

==Early life==
Leo is the second son of Benjamin Soriano, a [[Methodist]] [[Pastor]], and Purificacion Aranda, a [[teacher]]. He has two brothers, Henry and Bliss and a sister, Phoebe. He was born and spent his early childhood in [[Binalonan]], [[Pangasinan]]. His family moved to [[Cagayan de Oro]] where he spent his teenage years. Growing up in [[Mindanao]], he became an active member of the [[Methodist]] Youth Fellowship. His early involvement in church activities would later influence him to entin different [[college]] activities and organizations including the [[ROTC]], [[Glee Club]], and university organs. He finished his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree with flying colors. His Bachelor of Science degree inclined him to pursue a degree in [[medicine]] but Leo has another [[calling (religious)|calling]]. He instead went to [[Manila]] and studied in [[seminary]]. He met his [[wife]], Dania, while in seminary. They married in 1977. They have four children: Hesed, Nezer, Omar and Ronald.

==Medical Missionary==
He started his ministry after graduating [[cum laude]] from the [[Union Theological Seminary (Philippines)|Union Theological Seminary]] in the Philippines. While raising a family, Leo studied and earned a doctor of medicine degree from the Davao Medical School Foundation. Despite the many opportunities of earning big as a doctor, Leo chose to answer God's call to bring the good news and fullness of life to the deprived, underserved and underprivileged. He was appointed as ''Doctor in Mission'' for the Medical Mobile Clinic of the Mindanao [[Annual Conference]]. This position led him to work in the underserved and far-flung [[villages]] and [[mountains]] in the war-torn area of [[Mindanao]] and [[Visayas]]. He served as a missionary doctor from 1989 until the late 1990s. Leo faithfully fulfilled his call despite the danger of being caught in the crossfire between the rebels and military and the difficulty of travelling three days by horseback riding, crossing rivers by bamboo barge and climbing mountains by foot. He reached out to the hundreds of ethnic groups and underserved communities in the provinces of Cotabato, Davao, Leyte, Samar, Sultan Kudarat, Zamboanga and even in Palawan. When Mt. Pinatubo erupted in 1992, he was there serving the ethnic groups (Aetas) of Zambales. He pioneered in giving medical care to these people who have not seen a doctor in their whole life. He genuinely served the underprivileged for more than a decade without the fanfare of the media and away from the limelight. He held that position until the project funded by the [[United Methodist Church|U.M.]] General Board of Global Ministries changed it to a [[Community-based Primary Health Care Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbgm-umc.org/mindpac/community.htm |title=Davao Episcopal Area CCPHCP |work=The United Methodist Church |accessdate=2007-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095630/http://www.gbgm-umc.org/mindpac/community.htm |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episcopal Ministry==
Leo Soriano was elected as [[Bishop#United Methodist Church|Bishop]] on the 5th ballot during the 2000 [[Philippines Central Conference]] held in [[Cabanatuan City]], Philippines. The overwhelming support and his early election in the 5th Ballot was phenomenal and unprecedented in the history of the United Methodist Church in the Philippines. His election was an indication of the Filipino Methodists desire of change in their church politics. The personal background of Leo, having family roots from the North of the country yet living and representing the South, became a symbol of the desire of the Church to be all inclusive and intentional in representing equally all ethnic groups of the country.

He served as the [[Resident Bishop (United Methodist)|Resident Bishop]] of the [[Davao City|Davao]] [[Episcopal area (United Methodist Church)|episcopal area]], one of three episcopal areas of the Philippines, for 12 years (2000-2012).  His offices were in the ''Spottswood Methodist Center'' in [[Kidapawan City]]. In 2004 he was appointed to a four-year position as one of four voting members of the [[General Council on Finance and Administration]] of the [[United Methodist Church]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gcfa.org/PDFs/Council_Member_List.pdf | title = 2004-2008 Quadrennium Council Member List | work = General Council on Finance and Administration | accessdate = 2007-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has served as a member of the UMC ''Council of Bishops'', the UMC ''General Council on Ministries'', and the cross denominational organisations [[Christian Conference of Asia]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.indianchristianity.org/cca.html | title = CCA Member Churches | work = The Malankara Church | accessdate = 2007-02-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070306061956/http://www.indianchristianity.org/cca.html | archivedate = 2007-03-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Council of Churches in the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cca.org.hk/resources/archive/ccanews/99-4.pdf |journal=[[Christian Conference of Asia]] News |date=December 1999 |volume=34 |issue=4 |title=NCCP Elects First Woman General Secretary |accessdate=2009-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120053208/http://www.cca.org.hk/resources/archive/ccanews/99-4.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has acted as a spokesperson for UMC Philippines during the December 2003 [[2003 Pacific typhoon season|typhoons]] and [[Southern Leyte]] mudslides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nvoad.org/report.php?reportid=72 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060930163252/http://www.nvoad.org/report.php?reportid=72 | archivedate = 2006-09-30 | title = UMCOR Hotline 30 Dec 2003: Iran, Haiti, Philippines | work = [[National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster]] | date = December 30, 2003 | accessdate = 2007-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and signing a Bible sent to President [[George W. Bush]] as congratulations following his re-election, a 200-year-old UMC tradition.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

On November 24, 2008, Bishop Soriano was re-elected for a third term as Bishop of the United Methodist Church and was reassigned to Davao Episcopal Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=1723955&amp;ct=6362989 |title=Featured News &amp; Stories |publisher=UMC.org |date=2008-11-24 |accessdate=2009-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607060106/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=1723955&amp;ct=6362989 |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop Soriano retired from active service in December 2012 during the Philippine Central Conference of the UMC held in Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcc-umc.org&lt;/ref&gt; As he was to retire during that conference, he delivered the Episcopal Address as was the tradition in the UMC. He was given a tribute and a retirement service during the said conference.

==Post-Episcopacy==
Bishop Soriano teaches at the Southern Philippines Methodist Colleges in Kidapawan, North Cotabato and the Bishop Han Theological Seminary in Bukidnon. He mentors aspiring pastors from different Christian traditions and denominations on practical ministry. Using his medical background and pastoral experience, he designed a special course with his son Nezer entitle Intro to Health Ministry that teaches young pastors and students about Wesley's emphasis on holistic ministry to the physical body, soul and the environment. Bishop Soriano also teaches Intro to Old Testament.

==Advocacy==
Bishop Soriano is one of the Filipino bishops that support an autonomous, affiliated relationship with the United Methodist Church. His election is an overwhelming indication of the desire of the Filipino Methodist to be led by leaders who will move the Filipino United Methodist Church a step closer to becoming autonomous.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3865">The '''Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2006-01-05/pdf/06-4.pdf |title=Federal Register / Vol 71, No.3: Environment Protection agency |publisher=Gpo.gov.fdsys.pkg/fr |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("'''LT2ESWTR'''" or simply "'''LT2'''") is a modification of the 1973 [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] that was adopted on March 6, 2006 by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].  The rule put in place more stringent treatment requirements for surface drinking water, for the stated purpose of controlling spread of the microorganism [[Cryptosporidium]].

==Historical context==
Drafting of the LT2 rule began following the [[1993 Milwaukee Cryptosporidiosis outbreak]], in which it is believed that municipal sewage infected with [[Cryptosporidium]] was accidentally discharged into the city of [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]'s drinking water.&lt;ref name="Healio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/gastrointestinal-infections/news/print/infectious-disease-news/%7Bc89c35b9-b521-43e5-960c-1d3809f77482%7D/cryptosporidium-in-milwaukees-water-supply-caused-widespread-illness|title=Cryptosporidium in Milwaukee's water supply caused widespread illness &amp;#124; Infectious Disease News|author=William R. Mac Kenzie|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Healio.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The LT2 rule has been criticized for mandating costly public works projects (such as coverage of open-air reservoirs) that may be unnecessary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/federal-government-scrap-much-derided-1-6-billion-reservoir-cap-article-1.949327 |title=Federal government may scrap much-derided $1.6 billion reservoir cap |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2011-08-21 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or unlikely to address the kind of problem that was responsible for the Milwaukee incident.  As stated by William R. MacKenzie, M.D., a [[Centers for Disease Control]] epidemiologist who served as the Epidemic Intelligence Officer on the Milwaukee case, "Standards for water treatment facilities were about to be implemented throughout the nation; but even those would not have stopped the Milwaukee outbreak."&lt;ref name=Healio/&gt;

Critics have alleged that LT2's mandates may have been aimed more at appeasing the corporate public-works-engineering industry, which lobbied the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] during the LT2 drafting process, and which has benefited from hundreds of millions of dollars in ensuing public works contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slocoastjournal.com/docs/archives/2010/Nov/pages/news2.html |title=News Continued |publisher=Slo Coast Journal |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://whoisjoeglicker.wordpress.com/ |title=Who Is Joe Glicker? &amp;#124; Would you like a nice cup of Radon? |publisher=Whoisjoeglicker.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
In response to growing criticism that the rule unfairly burdens public water systems that are not exposed to municipal sewage, EPA Administrator [[Lisa P. Jackson|Lisa Jackson]] announced on August 19, 2011, that the EPA would reconsider the scientific validity of LT2's reservoir coverage and treatment requirements during [[Periodic Retrospective Review of Regulations]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opb.org/news/media/uploads/pdf/2011/scan_signed_response_to_existing_control_11.pdf |title=United states Environmental Protection Agency: August 2011 |publisher=Opb.org |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Staying Alive''' is an MTV international initiative to encourage [[HIV prevention]], promote safer lifestyle choices and fight the stigma and discrimination which fuels the [[HIV epidemic]]. Staying Alive is now the world’s largest HIV mass media awareness and prevention campaign. It produces TV programming in the form of concerts, documentaries, public service announcements, TV film, film competitions and others.  It also boasts a 13 language website with celebrity content talking about [[safe sex]].

== Goals and objective ==

===Goals===

Staying Alive’s aim is to reduce HIV infections among young people globally. It does this by using entertainment to bring across vital safe sex information so that young people are empowered to make safer sexual and lifestyle decisions.

=== Objectives ===

• To raise awareness and knowledge about HIV/AIDS and safer sex skills for young people.
&lt;br&gt;
• To fight the stigma and [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS]].
&lt;br&gt;
• To empower young people to take concrete action to protect themselves and others against HIV/AIDS.
&lt;br&gt;
• To engage other businesses, media and organisations to form their own response to HIV/AIDS. This includes broadcasting or using Staying Alive material rights free, at no cost.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

== Reach ==

Staying Alive currently reaches 64% of the world’s TV households, and 90% of the top 50 AIDS affected countries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Staying Alive’s distribution reach extends to all but thirteen countries in the world.  Staying Alive does this, not only through MTV’s extensive global reach, but also with its rights free strategy, enabling all broadcasters around the world to air Staying Alive content at no cost.

== History ==

Staying Alive began in 1998 as a one off award-winning{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} documentary, of the same name, about six young people from around the world and how their lives were affected by HIV and AIDS and hosted by [[George Michael]].
In 2002, Staying Alive expanded into an ongoing global multi media campaign that provides targeted information about HIV and AIDS using a wide range of interventions that include programming, advocacy and grant-making. Staying Alive is now the world’s leading media response to HIV and AIDS, developing widely recognised cutting edge products as part of its comprehensive approach.
In 2005, Staying Alive launched the Staying Alive Foundation to provide small grants to young people who are responding to the multiple threats of HIV, through prevention and create enabling environments for HIV+ people in their communities.

== Evaluation ==

The 2005 evaluation of Staying Alive found that the campaign resulted in significantly more interpersonal communication about HIV/AIDS amongst those who were exposed to the campaign and that this in turn had a positive effect on social norms. More young people exposed to the campaign felt it was important to use a condom, discussed HIV with a sexual partner and reported getting tested for HIV.&lt;ref&gt;FHI/YouthNet 2005 Using Global Media to Reach Youth: The 2002 MTV Staying Alive Campaign&gt;[http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2007/unaids_private_sector_case_studies_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Staying Alive Foundation ==

In 2005 the Staying Alive Foundation was launched.  The Staying Alive Foundation is a public charity registered in the US and UK and supported by MTV. Twice yearly, the Foundation presents the Staying Alive Awards: small grants that support innovative projects by youth-led organisations in schools, youth centres, and clubs using radio, TV, print, on-line and personal interactions that reach at-risk youth and protect them from the multiple threats posed by HIV and AIDS.
The Foundation's mandate to support individuals fighting AIDS on the frontlines is an unusual grant-making strategy that is showing extraordinary results as more and more young Award winners become HIV-prevention leaders in their communities.
In 2008 the R&amp;B singer-songwriter [[Kelly Rowland]] was appointed as the global Ambassador for the MTV Staying Alive Foundation. In June 2008, Kelly Rowland visited SAF projects in Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa.

== Programming ==

The multimedia campaign includes full-length programming such as documentaries about young people living with, affected by and responding to HIV; concert featuring some of the biggest stars of the music scene; discussion programmes; public service announcements and more.
All Staying Alive programming is offered rights free and at no cost to any TV broadcaster that wants to use it. As a result, Staying Alive regularly reaches more than 90% of the top 50 AIDS-affected countries.

=== Transit ===
In 2005 Staying Alive produced its first film: Transit. Shot in Los Angeles, Mexico City, St Petersburg, and Nairobi, it deals with the complexities of sexual relationships in a time of HIV and globalisation. Transit raised issues of self–esteem, violence in relationships, drugs, multiple partners, condom use and [[HIV testing]]. The film was accompanied by a teaching kit and discussion guide used to discuss some of the issues raised in the story. Transit has been translated into 16 languages.

'''Medicare''' is a [[Single-payer healthcare|single-payer]] national [[health insurance]] program in the United States, begun in 1966 under the Social Security Administration and now administered by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]]. It provides health insurance for Americans [[old age|aged 65 and older]] who have worked and paid into the system through the payroll tax. It also provides health insurance to younger people with some [[disability]] status as determined by the Social Security Administration, as well as people with [[End Stage Renal Disease Program|end stage renal disease]] and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]. Medicare is funded by a combination of a [[payroll tax]], premiums and surtaxes from [[#Eligibility|beneficiaries]], and general revenue.

In 2015, Medicare provided health insurance for over 55 million—46 million people age 65 and older and 9 million younger people. In January 2018, new Medicare (Red, White and Blue) cards were issued to all beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;2016 Annual Report of the Medicare Trustees (for the year 2015), June 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; On average, Medicare covers about half of the healthcare charges for those enrolled. The enrollees must then cover their remaining costs either with supplemental insurance, separate insurance, or out of pocket. Out-of-pocket costs can include [[Deductible|deductibles]] and [[Copayment|co-pays]]; the costs of uncovered services—such as for long-term, dental, hearing, and vision care—and supplemental insurance premiums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://facts.kff.org/chart.aspx?cb=58&amp;sctn=168&amp;ch=1785 Kaiser Slides | The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation]. Facts.kff.org. Retrieved on July 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicare is further divided into parts A and B—Medicare Part A covers hospital (inpatient, formally admitted only), skilled nursing (only after being formally admitted for three days and not for custodial care), and hospice services; Part B covers outpatient services including some providers' services while inpatient at a hospital. Part D covers self-administered prescription drugs. Part C is an alternative called Managed Medicare by the Trustees that allows patients to choose plans with at least the same benefits as Parts A and B (but most often more), often the benefits of Part D, and always an annual out of pocket spend limit which A and B lack; the beneficiary must enroll in Parts A and B first before signing up for Part C.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Medicare |url=https://www.medicare.gov/about-us/about-medicare.html |website=https://www.medicare.gov/|publisher=U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, Baltimore |accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Medicare bill, with Harry Truman, July 30, 1965.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] signing the Medicare amendment. Former President [[Harry S. Truman]] (seated) and his wife, [[Bess Truman|Bess]], are on the far right]]

The name "Medicare" was originally given to a program providing medical care for families of people serving in the military as part of the Dependents' Medical Care Act, which was passed in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, P. I. (1957). Medicare : Uniformed Services Program for Dependents. Social Security Bulletin, 20(7), 9–16.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] held the first White House Conference on Aging in January 1961, in which creating a health care program for social security beneficiaries was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Tibbits C. "The 1961 White House Conference on Aging: it's rationale, objectives, and procedures". J Am Geriatr Soc. 1960 May. 8:373–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mcnamara PAT, Dirksen EM, Church F, Muskie ES. The 1961 White House Conference on Aging : basic policy statements and recommendations / prepared for the Special Committee on Aging, United States Senate 87th Congress, 1st Session, Committee Print, May 15, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Medicare Bill Signed By Johnson: 33 Congressmen Attend Ceremony In Truman Library |first= Edward T. |last= Folliard |work= The Washington Post |date= July 31, 1965 |page= A1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/142611149/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]], Congress enacted Medicare under Title XVIII of the [[Social Security Act of 1965|Social Security Act]] to provide health insurance to people age 65 and older, regardless of income or medical history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= What Medicare Means to Taxpayers: How to Get Voluntary Insurance |first= Drew |last= Pearson |work= The Washington Post |date= July 29, 1965 |page= C13 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/142602859/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Health Insurance for the Aged Act, Title I of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89-97, 79 Stat. 286 (July 30, 1965), generally effective beginning with the month of July 1966. Section 321 of the Act amended section 1401 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to impose the Medicare tax.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson signed the bill into law on July 30, 1965 at the [[Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|Harry S. Truman Presidential Library]] in [[Independence, Missouri]]. Former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] and his wife, former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Bess Truman]] became the first recipients of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/anniversaries/medicarebill.htm|title=Truman Library - July 30, 1965: President Lyndon B. Johnson Signs Medicare Bill|website=www.trumanlibrary.org|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Medicare was created, approximately 60% of people over the age of 65 had health insurance, with coverage often unavailable or unaffordable to many others, as older adults paid more than three times as much for health insurance as younger people. Many of this latter group (about 20% of the total in 2015) became "dual eligible" for both Medicare and Medicaid with passing the law. In 1966, Medicare spurred the [[racial integration]] of thousands of waiting rooms, hospital floors, and physician practices by making payments to health care providers conditional on [[desegregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.nasi.org/sites/default/files/research/Strenthening%20Medicare's%20Role%20In%20Reducing.pdf |title= Strengthening Medicare's Role in Reducing Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities |work= National Academy of Social Insurance |accessdate= July 17, 2013 |editor-first= Bruce C. |editor-last= Vladeck |editor2-first= Paul N. |editor2-last= Van de Water |editor3-first= June |editor3-last= Eichner |date= October 2006 |author= Study Panel on Medicare and Disparities |format= pdf |isbn= 978-1-884902-47-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicare has been operated for a half century and, during that time, has undergone several changes. Since 1965, the program's provisions have expanded to include benefits for speech, physical, and chiropractic therapy in 1972.&lt;ref name="medicare.gov, 2012"&gt;medicare.gov, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare added the option of payments to [[health maintenance organizations]] (HMO)&lt;ref name="medicare.gov, 2012"/&gt; in the 1980s. As the years progressed, Congress expanded Medicare eligibility to younger people with permanent disabilities and receive [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSDI) payments and to those with [[end-stage renal disease]] (ESRD). The association with HMOs begun in the 1980s was formalized under President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1997 as Medicare Part C (although not all Part C health plans sponsors have to be HMOs, about 75% are). In 2003, under President [[George W. Bush]], a [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare program for covering almost all self administered prescription drugs]] was passed (and went into effect in 2006) as Medicare Part D (previously and still, professionally administered drugs such as chemotherapy but even the annual flu shot are covered under Part B).

The government added [[hospice]] benefits to aid elderly people on a temporary basis in 1982,&lt;ref name="medicare.gov, 2012"/&gt; and made this permanent in 1984. Congress further expanded Medicare in 2001 to cover younger people with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease).

==Administration==
{{hus}}
The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS), a component of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), administers Medicare, [[Medicaid]], the [[Children's Health Insurance Program]] (CHIP), the [[Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments]] (CLIA), and parts of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) ("Obamacare").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About CMS|url=http://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/About-CMS.html|website=CMS.gov|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[United States Department of Labor|Departments of Labor]] and [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]], the CMS also implements the insurance reform provisions of the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] of 1996 (HIPAA) and most aspects of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 as amended. The [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA) is responsible for determining Medicare eligibility, eligibility for and payment of Extra Help/Low Income Subsidy payments related to Part D Medicare, and collecting some premium payments for the Medicare program.

The Chief Actuary of the CMS must provide accounting information and cost-projections to the Medicare Board of Trustees to assist them in assessing the program's financial health. The Board is required by law to issue annual reports on the financial status of the Medicare Trust Funds, and those reports are required to contain a statement of actuarial opinion by the Chief Actuary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actuary.org/pdf/medicare/medicare_actuary_jan02.pdf "What Is the Role of the Federal Medicare Actuary?,"] [[American Academy of Actuaries]], January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actuarialstandardsboard.org/pdf/asops/asop032_062.pdf "Social Insurance,"] Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 32, Actuarial Standards Board, January 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Medicare program began, the CMS (that was not always the name of the responsible bureaucracy) has contracted with private insurance companies to operate as intermediaries between the government and medical providers to administer Part A and Part B benefits. Contracted processes include claims and payment processing, call center services, clinician enrollment, and fraud investigation. Beginning in 1997 and 2005, respectively, these, along with other insurance companies and other companies or organizations (such as integrated health delivery systems or unions), also began administering Part C and Part D plans.

The [[Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee]] (or Relative Value Update Committee; RUC), composed of [[physician]]s associated with the [[American Medical Association]], advises the government about pay standards for Medicare patient procedures performed by doctors and other professionals under Medicare Part B.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150531"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pear |first=Robert |title=Federal Investigators Fault Medicare's Reliance on Doctors for Pay Standards |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/us/federal-investigators-fault-medicares-reliance-on-doctors-for-pay-standards.html |date=May 31, 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=June 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar but different CMS system determines the rates paid for acute care and other hospitals—including skilled nursing facilities—under Medicare Part A.

==Financing==
Medicare has several sources of financing.

Part A's [[Inpatient care|inpatient]] admitted hospital and skilled nursing coverage is largely funded by revenue from a 2.9% [[payroll tax]] levied on employers and workers (each pay 1.45%). Until December 31, 1993, the law provided a maximum amount of compensation on which the Medicare tax could be imposed annually, in the same way that the Social Security tax works in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Title 26, Subtitle C, Chapter 21 of the [[United States Code]]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning on January 1, 1994, the compensation limit was removed. Self-employed individuals must pay the entire 2.9% tax on self-employed net earnings (because they are both employee and employer), but they may deduct half of the tax from the income in calculating income tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=IRS|url=https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Self-Employment-Tax-%28Social-Security-and-Medicare-Taxes%29 |title=Self-Employment Tax (Social Security and Medicare Taxes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2013, the rate of Part A tax on earned income exceeding US$200,000 for individuals (US$250,000 for married couples filing jointly) rose to 3.8%, in order to pay part of the cost of the subsidies mandated by the Affordable Care Act.&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Administration: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/taxRates.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts B and D are partially funded by premiums paid by Medicare enrollees and general fund revenue. In 2006, a surtax was added to Part B premium for higher-income seniors to partially fund Part D. In the Affordable Care Act's legislation of 2010, another surtax was then added to Part D premium for higher-income seniors to partially fund the Affordable Care Act and the number of Part B beneficiaries subject to the 2006 surtax was doubled, also partially to fund PPACA.

Parts A and B/D use separate trust funds to receive and disburse the funds mentioned above. Part C uses these two trust funds as well in a proportion determined by the CMS reflecting how Part C beneficiaries are fully on Parts A and B of Medicare, but how their medical needs are paid for per capita rather than "fee for service" (FFS).

In 2015, Medicare spending accounted for about 15% of total US federal spending. This share is projected to exceed 17% by 2020.&lt;ref name="kff.org"&gt;[http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7731-03.pdf A Primer on Medicare Financing | The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation]. Kff.org (January 31, 2011). Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retirement of the [[Post–World War II baby boom|Baby Boom]] generation — which by 2030 is projected to increase enrollment to more than 80 million as the number of workers per enrollee declines from 3.7 to 2.4 — and rising overall [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs in the nation]] pose substantial financial challenges to the program. Medicare spending is projected to increase from $523 billion in 2010 to just over $1 trillion by 2022.&lt;ref name="kff.org"/&gt; Baby-boomers' health is also an important factor: 20% have five or more chronic conditions, which will add to the future cost of health care. In response to these financial challenges, Congress made substantial cuts to future payouts to providers as part of PPACA in 2010 and the [[Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015]] (MACRA) and policymakers have offered many additional competing proposals to reduce Medicare costs further.

Nearly one in three dollars spent on Medicare flows through one of several [[Health economics|cost-reduction programs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21706527-obamacares-future-not-yet-secure-encumbered-exchange|title=Encumbered exchange|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cost reduction is influenced by factors including reduction in inappropriate and unnecessary care by [[Managed care|evaluating evidence-based practices]] as well as reducing the amount of unnecessary, duplicative, and inappropriate care. Cost reduction may also be effected by reducing medical errors, investment in [[Healthcare Information Technology|healthcare information technology]], improving transparency of cost and quality data, increasing [[Health administration|administrative efficiency]], and by developing both clinical/non-clinical guidelines and quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/QualityInitiativesGenInfo/Downloads/CMS-Quality-Strategy.pdf|title=CMS Quality Strategy, 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=Sep 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
In general, all persons 65 years of age or older who have been legal residents of the United States for at least five years are eligible for Medicare. [[People with disabilities]] under 65 may also be eligible if they receive [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSDI) benefits. Specific medical conditions may also help people become eligible to enroll in Medicare.

People qualify for Medicare coverage, and Medicare Part A premiums are entirely waived, if the following circumstances apply:
* They are 65 years or older ''and'' US citizens or have been permanent legal residents for five continuous years, ''and'' they or their spouse (or qualifying ex-spouse) has paid Medicare taxes for at least 10 years.
:''or''
* They are under 65, disabled, and have been receiving either [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] SSDI benefits or [[Railroad Retirement Board]] disability benefits; they must receive one of these benefits for at least 24 months from date of entitlement (eligibility for first disability payment) before becoming eligible to enroll in Medicare.
:''or''
* They get continuing dialysis for [[Chronic kidney disease|end stage renal disease]] or need a [[Kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]].

Those who are 65 and older who choose to enroll in Part A Medicare must pay a monthly premium to remain enrolled in Medicare Part A if they or their spouse have not paid the qualifying Medicare payroll taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://questions.medicare.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/10 |title=Medicare.gov website |publisher=Questions.medicare.gov |date=June 26, 2001 |accessdate=June 7, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[People with disabilities]] who receive SSDI are eligible for Medicare while they continue to receive SSDI payments; they lose eligibility for Medicare based on disability if they stop receiving SSDI. The 24-month exclusion means that people who become disabled must wait two years before receiving government medical insurance, unless they have one of the listed diseases. The 24-month period is measured from the date that an individual is determined to be eligible for SSDI payments, not necessarily when the first payment is actually received. Many new SSDI recipients receive "back" disability pay, covering a period that usually begins six months from the start of disability and ending with the first monthly SSDI payment.

Some beneficiaries are [[Medicare dual eligible|dual-eligible]]. This means they qualify for both Medicare and [[Medicaid]]. In some states for those making below a certain income, Medicaid will pay the beneficiaries' Part B premium for them (most beneficiaries have worked long enough and have no Part A premium), as well as some of their out of pocket medical and hospital expenses.

==Benefits and parts==
[[File:Medicare.gif|thumb|right|500px|US Medicare logo (2008)]]
Medicare has four parts: Part A is Hospital Insurance. Part B is Medical Insurance. [[Medicare Part D]] covers many [[prescription drugs]], though some are covered by Part B. In general, the distinction is based on whether or not the drugs are self-administered. Part C health plans, the most popular of which are branded Medicare Advantage, are another way for Original Medicare (Part A and B) beneficiaries to receive their Part A, B and D benefits. All Medicare benefits are subject to [[medical necessity]].

The original program included Parts A and B. Part-C-like plans have existed as demonstration projects in Medicare since the early 1980s but the Part was formalized by 1997 legislation. Part D was introduced January 1, 2006.

{{anchor|PartA|Part A}}

===Part A: Hospital/hospice insurance===
Part A covers [[Inpatient care|inpatient]] [[hospital]] stays where the beneficiary has been formally admitted to the hospital, including semi-private room, food, and tests. As of January 1, 2018, Medicare Part A has an inpatient hospital deductible of $1340, coinsurance per day as $335 after 61 days confinement within one "spell of illness", coinsurance for "lifetime reserve days" (essentially, days 91-150) of $670 per day, and coinsurance in an Skilled Nursing Facility (following a medically necessary hospital confinement of 3 night in row or more) for days 21-100 of $167.50 per day (up to 20 days of SNF confinement have no co-pay) These amounts increase or decrease yearly on 1st day of the year.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The maximum length of stay that Medicare Part A covers in a hospital inpatient stay or series of stays is typically 90 days. The first 60 days would be paid by Medicare in full, except one copay (also and more commonly referred to as a "deductible") at the beginning of the 60 days of $1340 as of 2018. Days 61–90 require a co-payment of $335 per day as of 2018. The beneficiary is also allocated "lifetime reserve days" that can be used after 90 days. These lifetime reserve days require a copayment of $670 per day as of 2018, and the beneficiary can only use a total of 60 of these days throughout their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/costs-at-a-glance/costs-at-glance.html|title=Medicare 2018 costs at a glance|publisher=Medicare |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new pool of 90 hospital days, with new copays of $1340 in 2018 and $335 per day for days 61–90, starts only after the beneficiary has 60 days continuously with no payment from Medicare for hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicare.gov/glossary/b.html|title=Benefit period|publisher=Medicare |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some "hospital services" can be done as inpatient services, which would be reimbursed under Part A; or as outpatient services, which would be reimbursed, not under Part A, but under Part B instead. The "Two-Midnight Rule" decides which is which. In August 2013, the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] announced a final rule concerning eligibility for hospital inpatient services effective October 1, 2013. Under the new rule, if a physician admits a Medicare beneficiary as an inpatient with an expectation that the patient will require hospital care that "crosses two midnights," Medicare Part A payment is "generally appropriate." However, if it is anticipated that the patient will require hospital care for less than two midnights, Medicare Part A payment is generally not appropriate; payment such as is approved will be paid under Part B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hord|first=Emily M.|author2=McBrayer|author3=McGinnis|author4=Leslie|last5=Kirkland, PLLC|title=Clarifying the "Two-Midnight Rule" and Part A Payments Re: Inpatient Care|journal=The National Law Review|date=September 10, 2013|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/clarifying-two-midnight-rule-and-part-payments-re-inpatient-care}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time a patient spends in the hospital before an inpatient admission is formally ordered is considered outpatient time. But, hospitals and physicians can take into consideration the pre-inpatient admission time when determining if a patient's care will reasonably be expected to cross two midnights to be covered under Part A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hord|first=Emily M.|title=Clarifying the "Two-Midnight Rule" and Part A Payments, cont.|journal=The National Law Review|date=September 12, 2013|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/clarifying-two-midnight-rule-and-part-payments-cont}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to deciding which trust fund is used to pay for these various outpatient vs. inpatient charges, the number of days for which a person is formally considered an admitted patient affects eligibility for Part A skilled nursing services.

Medicare penalizes hospitals for [[Hospital Readmission|readmissions]]. After making initial payments for hospital stays, Medicare will take back from the hospital these payments, plus a penalty of 4 to 18 times the initial payment, if an above-average number of patients from the hospital are readmitted within 30 days. These readmission penalties apply after some of the most common treatments: [[pneumonia]], [[heart failure]], [[heart attack]], [[COPD]], [[knee replacement]], [[hip replacement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program.html |title=Readmissions Reduction Program, seen June 25, 2013 |publisher=Cms.gov |accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2013/march/14/revised-readmissions-statistics-hospitals-medicare.aspx |title=Kaiser health News, Medicare Revises Readmissions Penalties – Again |publisher=Kaiserhealthnews.org |date=March 14, 2013 |accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 18 states conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that 1.8 million Medicare patients aged 65 and older were readmitted within 30 days of an initial hospital stay in 2011; the conditions with the highest readmission rates were [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]], [[Sepsis|septicemia]], [[pneumonia]], and [[COPD|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] and [[bronchiectasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Hines AL, Barrett ML, Jiang HJ, Steiner CA | title = Conditions With the Largest Number of Adult Hospital Readmissions by Payer, 2011. | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #172 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = April 2014 | url = http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb172-Conditions-Readmissions-Payer.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part A fully covers brief stays for rehabilitation or convalescence in a [[skilled nursing facility]] and up to 100 days per medical necessity with a co-pay if certain criteria are met:

# A preceding hospital stay must be at least three days as an inpatient, three midnights, not counting the discharge date.
# The nursing home stay must be for something diagnosed during the hospital stay or for the main cause of hospital stay.
# If the patient is not receiving rehabilitation but has some other ailment that requires skilled nursing supervision then the nursing home stay would be covered.
# The care being rendered by the nursing home must be skilled. Medicare part A does not pay for stays that ''only'' provide custodial, non-skilled, or [[long-term care]] activities, including [[activities of daily living]] (ADL) such as personal hygiene, cooking, cleaning, etc.
# The care must be medically necessary and progress against some set plan must be made on some schedule determined by a doctor.

The first 20 days would be paid for in full by Medicare with the remaining 80 days requiring a co-payment of $167.50 per day as of 2018. Many [[insurance]] group retiree, Medigap and Part C insurance plans have a provision for additional coverage of skilled nursing care in the policies they sell. If a beneficiary uses some portion of their Part A benefit and then goes at least 60 days without receiving facility-based skilled services, the 90-day hospital clock and 100-day nursing home clock are reset and the person qualifies for new benefit periods.

[[Hospice|Hospice benefits]] are also provided under Part A of Medicare for terminally ill persons with less than six months to live, as determined by the patient's physician. The terminally ill person must sign a statement that hospice care has been chosen over other Medicare-covered benefits, (e.g. [[assisted living]] or hospital care).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicare.com/assisted-living/hospice-care.html Medicare Guide to Covered Products, Services and Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209113031/http://medicare.com/assisted-living/hospice-care.html |date=February 9, 2014 }}.

{{anchor|PartB|Part B}}

===Part B: Medical insurance===
Part B medical insurance helps pay for some services and products not covered by Part A, generally on an outpatient basis (but also when on an unadmitted observation status in a hospital). Part B is optional. It is often deferred if the beneficiary or his/her spouse is still working '''''and''''' has group health coverage through that employer. There is a lifetime penalty (10% per year on the premium) imposed for not enrolling in Part B when first eligible or if not covered by programs of the [[Veterans Health Administration]].

Part B coverage begins once a patient meets his or her deductible ($183 for 2017), then typically Medicare covers 80% of the RUC-set rate for approved services, while the remaining 20% is the responsibility of the patient,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=Anna Schwamlein|first2=Drinker|last2=Biddle|first3=Reath|last3=LLP|title=Dewonkify – Medicare Part B|journal=The National Law Review|date=November 5, 2013|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dewonkify-medicare-part-b}}&lt;/ref&gt; either directly or indirectly by private group retiree or [[Medigap]] insurance.

Part B coverage includes out patient physician services, visiting nurse, and other services such as [[Medical radiography|x-rays]], laboratory and diagnostic tests, influenza and pneumonia vaccinations, [[blood transfusion]]s, renal [[dialysis]], [[Outpatient surgery|outpatient hospital procedures]], limited ambulance transportation, [[immunosuppressive drug]]s for [[organ transplant]] recipients, [[chemotherapy]], hormonal treatments such as [[Lupron]], and other outpatient medical treatments administered in a doctor's office. It also includes chiropractic care. Medication administration is covered under Part B if it is administered by the physician during an office visit.

Part B also helps with [[durable medical equipment]] (DME), including [[cane (medical device)|canes]], [[walker (mobility)|walkers]], [[lift chair]]s, [[wheelchair]]s, and [[mobility scooter]]s for those with [[mobility impairment]]s. [[Prosthesis|Prosthetic devices]] such as [[artificial limb]]s and [[breast prosthesis]] following [[mastectomy]], as well as one pair of [[eyeglasses]] following [[cataract surgery]], and [[oxygen therapy|oxygen]] for home use is also covered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/aging/agin3390.html Medicare: Part A &amp; B], [[University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Complex rules control Part B benefits, and periodically issued advisories describe coverage criteria. On the national level these advisories are issued by CMS, and are known as National Coverage Determinations (NCD). Local Coverage Determinations (LCD) apply within the multi-state area managed by a specific regional Medicare Part B contractor, and Local Medical Review Policies (LMRP) were superseded by LCDs in 2003. Coverage information is also located in the CMS Internet-Only Manuals (IOM), the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR), the [[Social Security Act]], and the [[Federal Register]].

The Monthly Premium for Part B for 2016 is $121.80 per month but anyone on Social Security in 2015 is "held harmless" (from the fact that Social Security did not rise in 2016) and pays only the $104.90 premium withheld monthly in 2015, with income-weighted additional surtaxes for those with incomes more than $85,000 per annum.&lt;ref name="content"&gt;content&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|PartC|Part C}}

===Part C: Medicare Advantage plans===
{{main|Medicare Advantage}}
With the passage of the [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]], Medicare beneficiaries were formally given the option to receive their Original Medicare benefits through [[Capitation (healthcare)|capitated health insurance]] Part C plans, instead of through the Original fee for service Medicare payment system. Many had previously had that option via a series of demonstration projects that dated back to the early 1980s. These Part C plans were initially known as "Medicare+Choice". As of the [[Medicare Modernization Act]] of 2003, most "Medicare+Choice" plans were re-branded as "[[Medicare Advantage]]" (MA) plans (though MA is a government term and might not be visible to the Part C health plan beneficiary). Other plan types, such as 1876 Cost plans, are also available in limited areas of the country. Cost plans are not Medicare Advantage plans and are not capitated. Instead, beneficiaries keep their Original Medicare benefits while their sponsor administers their Part A and Part B benefits. The sponsor of a Part C plan could be an integrated health delivery system, a union, a religious organization, an insurance company or other type of organization.

Public Part C Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans are required to offer coverage that meets or exceeds the standards set by Original Medicare but they do not have to cover every benefit in the same way. After approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, if a Part C plan chooses to pay less than Original Medicare for some benefits, such as Skilled Nursing Facility care, the savings may be passed along to consumers by offering even lower co-payments for doctor visits.

Original "[[fee-for-service]]" Medicare Parts A and B have a standard benefit package that covers medically necessary care as described in the sections above that members can receive from nearly any hospital or doctor in the country (if that doctor or hospital accepts Medicare). Original Medicare beneficiaries who choose to enroll in a Part C Medicare Advantage health plan instead give up none of their rights as an Original Medicare beneficiary, receive the same standard benefits—as a minimum—as provided in Original Medicare, and get an annual out of pocket (OOP) upper spending limit not included in Original Medicare. However they must typically use only a select network of providers except in emergencies, typically restricted to the area surrounding their legal residence (which can vary from tens to over 100 miles depending on county). Most Part C plans are traditional [[health maintenance organization]]s (HMOs) that require the patient to have a primary care physician, though others are [[preferred provider organization]]s (which typically means the provider restrictions are not as confining as with an HMO), and a few are actually fee for service hybrids.

Public Part C Medicare Advantage health plan members typically usually also pay a monthly premium in addition to the Medicare Part B premium to cover items not covered by traditional Medicare (Parts A &amp; B), such as the OOP limit, self-administered prescription drugs, dental care, vision care, annual physicals, coverage outside the United States, and even gym or health club memberships as well as—and probably most importantly—reduce the 20% co-pays and high deductibles associated with Original Medicare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pope|first1=Christopher|title=Supplemental Benefits Under Medicare Advantage|url=http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2016/01/21/supplemental-benefits-under-medicare-advantage/|publisher=Health Affairs|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in some situations the benefits are more limited (but they can never be more limited than Original Medicare and must always include an OOP limit) and there is no premium. In some cases, the sponsor even rebates part or all of the Part B premium, though these types of Part C plans are becoming rare.

Before 2003 Part C plans tended to be suburban HMOs tied to major nearby teaching hospitals that cost the government the same as or even 5% less on average than it cost to cover the medical needs of a comparable beneficiary on Original Medicare. The 2003-law payment framework/bidding/rebate formulas overcompensated some Part C plans by 7 percent (2009) on average nationally compared to what Original Medicare beneficiaries cost per person on average nationally that year and as much as 5 percent (2016) less nationally in other years (see any recent year's Medicare Trustees Report, Table II.B.1). The MedPAC group found in one year the comparative difference for "like beneficiaries" (not all beneficiaries as described in the first sentence) was as high as 14% and have tended to average about 2% higher.&lt;ref&gt;Medicare Payment Advisory Commission Annual Reports to Congress, 2006-2018 {{Specify|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word like in the previous sentence is key. The intention of both the 1997 and 2003  law was that the differences between fee for service and capitated fee beneficiaries would reach parity over time.

The 2003 payment formulas succeeded in increasing the percentage of rural and inner city poor that could take advantage of the OOP limit and lower co-pays and deductibles—as well as the coordinated medical care—associated with Part C plans. In practice however, one set of Medicare beneficiaries received more benefits than others. The differences caused by the 2003-law payment formulas were almost completely eliminated by PPACA and have been almost totally phased out according to the 2018 MedPAC annual report, March 2018. One remaining special-payment-formula program—designed primarily for unions wishing to sponsor a Part C plan—is being phased out beginning in 2017. In 2013 and since, on average a Part C beneficiary cost the Medicare Trust Funds 2%-5% less than a beneficiary on traditional fee for service Medicare, completely reversing the situation in 2006-2009 right after implementation of the 2003 law and restoring the capitated fee vs fee for service funding balance to its original intended parity level.

Enrollment in public Part C health plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, grew from about 10% of total enrollment in 2005 to about 35% in 2018.  Almost all Medicare beneficiaries have access to at least two public Medicare Part C plans; most have access to three or more.

===Part D: Prescription drug plans===
{{Main|Medicare Part D|Medicare Part D coverage gap}}

[[Medicare Part D]] went into effect on January 1, 2006. Anyone with Part A or B is eligible for Part D, which covers mostly self-administered drugs. It was made possible by the passage of the [[Medicare Modernization Act]] of 2003. To receive this benefit, a person with Medicare must enroll in a stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) or Medicare Advantage plan with integrated prescription drug coverage (MA-PD). These plans are approved and regulated by the Medicare program, but are actually designed and administered by private health insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers. Unlike Original Medicare (Part A and B), Part D coverage is not standardized (though it is highly regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services). Plans choose which drugs they wish to cover (but must cover at least two drugs in 148 different categories and cover all or "substantially all" drugs in the following protected classes of drugs: anti-cancer; anti-psychotic; anti-convulsant, anti-depressants, immuno-suppressant, and HIV and AIDS drugs). The plans can also specify with CMS approval at what level (or tier) they wish to cover it, and are encouraged to use [[step therapy]]. Some drugs are excluded from coverage altogether and Part D plans that cover excluded drugs are not allowed to pass those costs on to Medicare, and plans are required to repay CMS if they are found to have billed Medicare in these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region6/60600022.pdf |title=Report on the Medicare Drug Discount Card Program Sponsor McKesson Health Solutions, A-06-06-00022 |format=PDF |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 2003 law that created Medicare Part D, the Social Security Administration offers an Extra Help program to lower-income seniors such that they have almost no drug costs; in addition approximately 25 states offer additional assistance on top of Part D. It should be noted again for beneficiaries who are dual-eligible (Medicare and Medicaid eligible) Medicaid may pay for drugs not covered by Part D of Medicare. Most of this aid to lower-income seniors was available to them through other programs before Part D was implemented.

==Out-of-pocket costs==
No part of Medicare pays for all of a beneficiary's covered medical costs and many costs and services are not covered at all. The program contains [[insurance premium|premiums]], [[deductible]]s and coinsurance, which the covered individual must [[out-of-pocket expenses|pay out-of-pocket]]. A study published by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] in 2008 found the Fee-for-Service Medicare benefit package was less generous than either the typical large employer [[preferred provider organization]] plan or the [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program]] Standard Option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Dale|last1=Yamamoto|first2=Tricia|last2=Neuman|first3=Michelle Kitchman|last3=Strollo|title=How Does the Benefit Value of Medicare Compare to the Benefit Value of Typical Large Employer Plans?|publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]]|date=September 2008|url=http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7768.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people may qualify to have other governmental programs (such as Medicaid) pay premiums and some or all of the costs associated with Medicare.

===Premiums===
Most Medicare enrollees do not pay a monthly Part A premium, because they (or a spouse) have had 40 or more 3-month quarters in which they paid [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act]] taxes. The benefit is the same no matter how much or how little the beneficiary paid as long as the minimum number of quarters is reached. Medicare-eligible persons who do not have 40 or more quarters of Medicare-covered employment may buy into Part A for an annual adjusted monthly premium of:
* $248.00 per month (as of 2012)&lt;ref name="healthharbor1"&gt;"{{cite web|url=http://www.healthharbor.com/medicare/2011-medicare-changes |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523085102/http://www.healthharbor.com/medicare/2011-medicare-changes |archivedate=May 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for those with 30–39 quarters of Medicare-covered employment, or
* $451.00 per month (as of 2012)&lt;ref name="healthharbor1"/&gt; for those with fewer than 30 quarters of Medicare-covered employment and who are not otherwise eligible for premium-free Part A coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://questions.medicare.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/2305 Medicare premiums and coinsurance rates for 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015004424/http://questions.medicare.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/2305 |date=October 15, 2011 }}, FAQ, Medicare.gov (11/05/2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Medicare Part B enrollees pay an [[insurance premium]] for this coverage; the standard Part B premium for 2013 through 2015 was $104.90 – $335.70 per month. The premium increased to over $120 a month in 2016 but only for those not on Social Security in 2015. A new income-based premium surtax [[Model (abstract)|schema]] has been in effect since 2007, wherein Part B premiums are higher for beneficiaries with incomes exceeding $85,000 for individuals or $170,000 for married couples. Depending on the extent to which beneficiary earnings exceed the base income, these higher Part B premiums are $139.90, $199.80, $259.70, or $319.70 for 2012, with the highest premium paid by individuals earning more than $214,000, or married couples earning more than $428,000.&lt;ref name="2012 Medicare &amp; You"&gt;2012 Medicare &amp; You handbook, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicare Part B premiums are commonly deducted automatically from beneficiaries' monthly Social Security checks. They can also be paid quarterly via bill sent directly to beneficiaries. This alternative is becoming more common because whereas the eligibility age for Medicare has remained at 65 per the 1965 legislation, the so-called Full Retirement Age for Social Security has been increased to 66 and will go even higher over time. Therefore, many people delay collecting Social Security and have to pay their Part B premium directly.

Part C plans may or may not charge premiums (almost all do), depending on the plans' designs as approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Part D premiums vary widely based on the benefit level.

===Deductible and coinsurance===
'''Part A ''' – For each [[benefit period]], a beneficiary pays an annually adjusted:
* A Part A deductible of $1,288 in 2016 and '''$1,316''' in '''2017''' for a hospital stay of 1–60 days.&lt;ref name="Medicare.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/costs-at-a-glance/costs-at-glance.html|title=Medicare 2017 costs at a glance|publisher=Medicare, U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, Baltimore|date=2017|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A $322 per day co-pay in 2016 and '''$329''' co-pay in '''2017''' for days 61–90 of a hospital stay.&lt;ref name="Medicare.gov"/&gt;
* A $644 per day co-pay in 2016 and '''$658''' co-pay in '''2017''' for days 91–150 of a hospital stay.,&lt;ref name="Medicare.gov"/&gt; as part of their limited [[Lifetime Reserve Days]].
* All costs for each day beyond 150 days&lt;ref name=Medicare.gov/&gt;
* Coinsurance for a Skilled Nursing Facility is '''$161''' per day in 2016 and '''$164.50''' in 2017 for days 21 through 100 for each benefit period (no co-pay for the first 20 days).&lt;ref name="Medicare.gov"/&gt;
* A blood deductible of the first 3 pints of blood needed in a calendar year, unless replaced. There is a 3-pint blood deductible for both Part A and Part B, and these separate deductibles do not overlap.

'''Part B''' – After beneficiaries meet the yearly deductible of '''$183.00''' for 2017, they will be required to pay a co-insurance of 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for all services covered by Part B with the exception of most lab services, which are covered at 100%—and outpatient mental health, which is currently (2010–2011) covered at 55% (45% copay). The copay for outpatient mental health, which started at 50%, is gradually decreasing over several years until it matches the 20% required for other services. They are also required to pay an excess charge of 15% for services rendered by physicians who do not accept assignment.

The deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance charges for Part C and D plans vary from plan to plan. All Part C plans include an annual out of pocket (OOP) upper spend limit. Original Medicare does not include an OOP limit.

===Medicare supplement (Medigap) policies===
{{Main|Medigap}}

Of the Medicare beneficiaries who are not dual eligible for both Medicare (around 20%) and Medicaid or that do not receive supplemental insurance via a former employer (40%) or a public Part C Medicare Advantage health plan (about 30%), almost all elect to purchase a type of private supplemental insurance coverage, called a Medigap plan (20%), to help fill in the financial holes in Original Medicare (Part A and B). Note that the percentages add up to over 100% because many beneficiaries have more than one type of supplement. These Medigap insurance policies are standardized by CMS, but are sold and administered by private companies. Some Medigap policies sold before 2006 may include coverage for prescription drugs. Medigap policies sold after the introduction of Medicare Part D on January 1, 2006 are prohibited from covering drugs. Medicare regulations prohibit a Medicare beneficiary from being sold both a public Part C Medicare Advantage health plan and a private Medigap Policy. As with public Part C health plans, private Medigap policies are only available to beneficiaries who are already signed up for benefits from Original Medicare Part A and Part B. These policies are regulated by state insurance departments rather than the federal government though CMS outlines what the various Medigap plans must cover at a minimum. Therefore, the types and prices of Medigap policies vary widely from state to state and the degree of underwriting, open enrollment and guaranteed issue also varies widely from state to state.

As of 2016, 11 policies are currently sold—though few are available in all states, and some are not available at all in Massachusetts, Minnesota and [https://wisconsinmedicaresupplementplans.com/ Wisconsin Medicare Supplement Plans] are standardized with a base and a series of riders.. These are Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, Plan D, Plan F, High Deductible Plan F, Plan G, Plan K, Plan L, Plan M, and Plan N. Cost is usually the only difference between Medigap policies with the same letter sold by different insurance companies. Unlike Medicare Advantage Plans, Medicare Supplement Plans have no networks, and any provider who accepts Medicare must also accept the Medicare Supplement Plan.

All insurance companies that sell Medigap policies are required to make Plan A available, and if they offer any other policies, they must also make either Plan C or Plan F available as well, though Plan F is scheduled to sunset in the year 2020. Anyone who currently has a Plan F may keep it.

==Payment for services==
Medicare contracts with regional insurance companies to process over one billion fee-for-service claims per year. In 2008, Medicare accounted for 13% ($386 billion) of the [[United States federal budget|federal budget]]. In 2016 it is projected to account for close to 15% ($683 billion) of the total expenditures. For the decade 2010–2019 Medicare is projected to cost 6.4 trillion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/USbudget/fy10/pdf/summary.pdf "Budget of the United States Government: Fiscal Year 2010 – Updated Summary Tables"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010084418/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/USbudget/fy10/pdf/summary.pdf |date=October 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reimbursement for Part A services===
For institutional care, such as hospital and nursing home care, Medicare uses [[prospective payment system]]s. In a prospective payment system, the health care institution receives a set amount of money for each episode of care provided to a patient, regardless of the actual amount of care. The actual allotment of funds is based on a list of [[diagnosis-related group]]s (DRG). The actual amount depends on the primary diagnosis that is actually made at the hospital. There are some issues surrounding Medicare's use of DRGs because if the patient uses less care, the hospital gets to keep the remainder. This, in theory, should balance the costs for the hospital. However, if the patient uses more care, then the hospital has to cover its own losses. This results in the issue of "upcoding," when a physician makes a more severe diagnosis to hedge against accidental costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Silverman E, Skinner J | year = 2004 | title = Medicare upcoding and hospital ownership | url = | journal = Journal of Health Economics | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 369–89 | doi=10.1016/j.jhealeco.2003.09.007| pmid = 15019762 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reimbursement for Part B services===
Payment for physician services under Medicare has evolved since the program was created in 1965. Initially, Medicare compensated physicians based on the physician's charges, and allowed physicians to bill Medicare beneficiaries the amount in excess of Medicare's reimbursement. In 1975, annual increases in physician fees were limited by the Medicare Economic Index (MEI). The MEI was designed to measure changes in costs of physician's time and operating expenses, adjusted for changes in physician productivity. From 1984 to 1991, the yearly change in fees was determined by legislation. This was done because physician fees were rising faster than projected.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 made several changes to physician payments under Medicare. Firstly, it introduced the Medicare Fee Schedule, which took effect in 1992. Secondly, it limited the amount Medicare non-providers could balance bill Medicare beneficiaries. Thirdly, it introduced the Medicare Volume Performance Standards (MVPS) as a way to control costs.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren A. McCormick, Russel T. Burge. [https://archive.is/20120630033016/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0795/is_n2_v16/ai_16863013 Diffusion of Medicare's RBRVS and related physician payment policies – resource-based relative value scale – Medicare Payment Systems: Moving Toward the Future] ''[[Health Care Financing Review]]''. Winter, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 1992, Medicare introduced the Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS), a list of about 7,000 services that can be billed for. Each service is priced within the [[Resource-Based Relative Value Scale]] (RBRVS) with three [[Relative Value Units]] (RVUs) values largely determining the price. The three RVUs for a procedure are each geographically weighted and the weighted RVU value is multiplied by a global Conversion Factor (CF), yielding a price in dollars. The RVUs themselves are largely decided by a private group of 29 (mostly [[Medical specialist|specialist]]) physicians—the [[American Medical Association]]'s [[Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee]] (RUC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Little-Known Decision-Makers for Medicare Physicians Fees |author=[[Uwe Reinhardt]] |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 10, 2010 |url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/10/the-little-known-decision-makers-for-medicare-physicans-fees/ |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1992 to 1997, adjustments to physician payments were adjusted using the MEI and the MVPS, which essentially tried to compensate for the increasing volume of services provided by physicians by decreasing their reimbursement per service.

In 1998, Congress replaced the VPS with the [[Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate|Sustainable Growth Rate]] (SGR). This was done because of highly variable payment rates under the MVPS. The SGR attempts to control spending by setting yearly and cumulative spending targets. If actual spending for a given year exceeds the spending target for that year, reimbursement rates are adjusted downward by decreasing the Conversion Factor (CF) for RBRVS RVUs.

In 2002, payment rates were cut by 4.8%. In 2003, payment rates were scheduled to be reduced by 4.4%. However, Congress boosted the cumulative SGR target in the Consolidated Appropriation Resolution of 2003 (P.L. 108-7), allowing payments for physician services to rise 1.6%. In 2004 and 2005, payment rates were again scheduled to be reduced. The Medicare Modernization Act (P.L. 108-173) increased payments 1.5% for those two years.

In 2006, the SGR mechanism was scheduled to decrease physician payments by 4.4%. (This number results from a 7% decrease in physician payments times a 2.8% inflation adjustment increase.) Congress overrode this decrease in the Deficit Reduction Act (P.L. 109-362), and held physician payments in 2006 at their 2005 levels. Similarly, another congressional act held 2007 payments at their 2006 levels, and HR 6331 held 2008 physician payments to their 2007 levels, and provided for a 1.1% increase in physician payments in 2009. Without further continuing congressional intervention, the SGR is expected to decrease physician payments from 25% to 35% over the next several years.

MFS has been criticized for not paying doctors enough because of the low conversion factor. By adjustments to the MFS conversion factor, it is possible to make global adjustments in payments to all doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=7425&amp;type=1 Medicare's Physician Payment Rates and the Sustainable Growth Rate]. (PDF) ''CBO TESTIMONY Statement of [[Donald B. Marron]], Acting Director''. July 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SGR was the subject of possible reform legislation again in 2014. On March 14, 2014, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed the [[SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4015; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would have replaced the (SGR) formula with new systems for establishing those payment rates.&lt;ref name=cbo4015&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4015 |url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45149|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bill would pay for these changes by delaying the [[Affordable Care Act]]'s individual mandate requirement, a proposal that was very unpopular with Democrats.&lt;ref name=ViebeckHill&gt;{{cite news|last=Viebeck|first=Elise|title=Obama threatens to veto GOP 'doc fix' bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/medicare/200620-obama-threatens-to-veto-gop-healthcare-bill|accessdate=March 13, 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SGR was expected to cause Medicare reimbursement cuts of 24 percent on April 1, 2014, if a solution to reform or delay the SGR was not found.&lt;ref name=GOPreadies26&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House GOP readies year-long 'doc fix'|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/healthcare/201770-gop-tees-up-year-long-doc-fix-patch|accessdate=March 27, 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to another bill, the [[Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (H.R. 4302; 113th Congress)]], which would delay those cuts until March 2015.&lt;ref name="GOPreadies26"/&gt; This bill was also controversial. The [[American Medical Association]] and other medical groups opposed it, asking Congress to provide a permanent solution instead of just another delay.&lt;ref name=HouseApproves27&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House approves 'doc fix' in voice vote|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/votes/201932-house-approves-doc-fix-in-voice-vote|accessdate=March 27, 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SGR process was replaced by new rules as of the passage of MACRA in 2015.

====Provider participation====
There are two ways for providers to be reimbursed in Medicare. "Participating" providers accept "assignment," which means that they accept Medicare's approved rate for their services as payment (typically 80% from Medicare and 20% from the beneficiary). Some non participating doctors do not take assignment, but they also treat Medicare enrollees and are authorized to balance bill no more than a small fixed amount above Medicare's approved rate. A minority of doctors are "private contractors," which means they opt out of Medicare and refuse to accept Medicare payments altogether. These doctors are required to inform patients that they will be liable for the full cost of their services out-of-pocket in advance of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;American Medical Association, [http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/399/medicarepayment08.pdf Medicare Payment Options for Physicians]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the majority of providers accept Medicare assignments, (97 percent for some specialties),&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation 2010 Chartbook, [http://facts.kff.org/chart.aspx?cb=58&amp;sctn=163&amp;ch=1742 "Figure 2.15"]&lt;/ref&gt; and most physicians still accept at least some new Medicare patients, that number is in decline.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation 2010 Chartbook, [http://facts.kff.org/chart.aspx?cb=58&amp;sctn=163&amp;ch=1742 "Figure 2.16]&lt;/ref&gt; While 80% of physicians in the Texas Medical Association accepted new Medicare patients in 2000, only 60% were doing so by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2013/06/11/what-to-do-if-your-doctor-wont-take-medicare/|title=What To Do If Your Doctor Won't Take Medicare|first=Caroline|last=Mayer|date=|website=forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 2012 concluded that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) relies on the recommendations of an American Medical Association advisory panel. The study led by Dr. Miriam J. Laugesen, of [[Columbia Mailman School of Public Health]], and colleagues at UCLA and the University of Illinois, shows that for services provided between 1994 and 2010, CMS agreed with 87.4% of the recommendations of the committee, known as RUC or the Relative Value Update Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Study Finds that the AMA Committee Recommendations on Doctor Fees Are Followed Nine Times out of Ten |author=Laugesen Miriam |newspaper=The [[National Law Review]] |date=May 10, 2012 |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/study-finds-ama-committee-recommendations-doctor-fees-are-followed-nine-times-out-te/ |accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmaceutical company discounts and rebates are included in the calculation of ASP, and tend to reduce it. In addition, Medicare pays 80% of ASP+6, which is the equivalent of 84.8% of the actual average cost of the drug. Some patients have supplemental insurance or can afford the co-pay. Large numbers do not. This leaves the payment to physicians for most of the drugs in an "underwater" state. ASP+6 superseded Average Wholesale Price in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E1DA1E30F93AA25754C0A9639C8B63 "Law Impedes Flow of Immunity in a Vial"], New York Times, July 19, 2005, by Andrew Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; after a 2003 front-page New York Times article drew attention to the inaccuracies of Average Wholesale Price calculations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/06/politics/06DRUG.html "Cancer Drugs Face Funds Cut in a Bush Plan"], New York Times, August 6, 2003, Robert Pear&lt;/ref&gt;

This procedure is scheduled to change dramatically in 2017 under a CMS proposal that will likely be finalized in October 2016.

Enrollment

Generally, if you already receive Social Security payments, at age 65 you are automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance). In addition, you are generally also automatically enrolled in Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance). If you choose to accept Part B you must pay a monthly premium to keep it. However, you may delay enrollment with no penalty under some circumstances, or with penalty under other circumstances.

If you are not eligible for premium-free Part A, and you don't buy a premium-based Part A when you're first eligible, your monthly premium may go up 10%. You must pay the higher premium for twice the number of years you could have had Part A, but didn't sign-up. For example, if you were eligible for Part A for 2 years but didn't sign-up, you must pay the higher premium for 4 years. Usually, you
don't have to pay a penalty if you meet certain conditions that allow you to sign up for Part A during a Special Enrollment Period.

'''Part B Late Enrollment Penalty'''
If you don't sign up for Part B when you're first eligible, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for as long as you have Medicare. Your monthly premium for Part B may go up 10% for
each full 12-month period that you could have had Part B, but didn't sign up for it. Usually, you don't pay a late enrollment penalty if you meet certain conditions that allow you to sign up for Part B during a special enrollment period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/10050.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060406005133/https://www.medicare.gov/publications/pubs/pdf/10050.pdf |archivedate=April 6, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with private insurance==

Medicare differs from private insurance available to working Americans in that it is a [[social insurance]] program. Social insurance programs provide statutorily guaranteed benefits to the entire population (under certain circumstances, such as old age or unemployment). These benefits are financed in significant part through universal taxes. In effect, Medicare is a mechanism by which the state takes a portion of its citizens' resources to guarantee health and financial security to its citizens in old age or in case of disability, helping them cope with the enormous, unpredictable cost of health care. In its universality, Medicare differs substantially from private insurers, which must decide whom to cover and what benefits to offer to manage their risk pools and guarantee their costs don't exceed premiums.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Because the federal government is legally obligated to provide Medicare benefits to older and disabled Americans, it cannot cut costs by restricting eligibility or benefits, except by going through a difficult legislative process, or by revising its interpretation of [[medical necessity]]. By statute, Medicare may only pay for items and services that are "reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member", unless there is another statutory authorization for payment.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 42 U.S.C. § [http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1862.htm 1395y(a)(1)(A)]&lt;/ref&gt; Cutting costs by cutting benefits is difficult, but the program can also achieve substantial economies of scale in terms of the prices it pays for health care and administrative expenses—and, as a result, private insurers' costs have grown almost 60% more than Medicare's since 1970.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;sup&gt;[Original research?]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Center or Medicare and Medicaid Services, [https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads//tables.pdf "NHE Web Tables for Selected Calendar Years 1960–2010"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411171845/https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/tables.pdf |date=April 11, 2012 }}, Table 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare's cost growth is now the same as GDP growth and expected to stay well below private insurance's for the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, [https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads//proj2010.pdf "National Health Expenditure Projections 2010–2020"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501105801/http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/proj2010.pdf |date=May 1, 2012 }}, Table 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Medicare offers statutorily determined benefits, its coverage policies and payment rates are publicly known, and all enrollees are entitled to the same coverage. In the private insurance market, plans can be tailored to offer different benefits to different customers, enabling individuals to reduce coverage costs while assuming risks for care that is not covered. Insurers, however, have far fewer disclosure requirements than Medicare, and studies show that customers in the private sector can find it difficult to know what their policy covers.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pollitz, et. Al [http://www.naic.org/documents/committees_b_consumer_information_coverage_facts_paper.pdf ""Coverage When It Counts: What Does Health Insurance In Massachusetts Cover And How Can Consumers Know?""] The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Georgetown University. May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and at what cost.&lt;ref&gt;GAO, [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11791.pdf ""Health Care Price Transparency: Meaningful price information is difficult for consumers to obtain prior to obtaining care.""] September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, since Medicare collects data about utilization and costs for its enrollees—data that private insurers treat as trade secrets—it gives researchers key information about health care system performance.

Medicare also has an important role driving changes in the entire health care system. Because Medicare pays for a huge share of health care in every region of the country, it has a great deal of power to set delivery and payment policies. For example, Medicare promoted the adaptation of prospective payments based on DRG's, which prevents unscrupulous providers from setting their own exorbitant prices.&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Reinhardt, [https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/how-medicare-pays-physicians/ ""How Medicare Pays Physicians""], The New York Times, December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] has given Medicare the mandate to promote cost-containment throughout the health care system, for example, by promoting the creation of accountable care organizations or by replacing fee-for-service payments with bundled payments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf "Summary of New Health Reform Law,"] Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Medicare, Medicaid, and social security spending.png|400px|right|Medicare, Medicaid, and social security spending]]

Over the long-term, Medicare faces significant financial challenges because of rising overall health care costs, increasing enrollment as the population ages, and a decreasing ratio of workers to enrollees. Total Medicare spending is projected to increase from $523 billion in 2010 to around $900 billion by 2020. From 2010 to 2030, Medicare enrollment is projected to increase from 47 million to 79 million, and the ratio of workers to enrollees is expected to decrease from 3.7 to 2.4.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cms.gov/ReportsTrustFunds/downloads/tr2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ratio of workers to retirees has declined steadily for decades, and social insurance systems have remained sustainable due to rising worker productivity. There is some evidence that [[productivity]] gains will continue to offset demographic trends in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicare Chartbook, 2010|url=http://kff.org/medicare/report/medicare-chartbook-2010/|work=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]]|accessdate=October 20, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.kff.org/medicare/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&amp;PageID=14160|archivedate=October 30, 2010|date=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) wrote in 2008 that "future growth in spending per beneficiary for Medicare and Medicaid—the federal government's major health care programs—will be the most important determinant of long-term trends in federal spending. Changing those programs in ways that reduce the growth of costs—which will be difficult, in part because of the complexity of health policy choices—is ultimately the nation's central long-term challenge in setting federal fiscal policy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/93xx/doc9385/06-17-LTBO_Testimony.pdf CBO | The Long-Term Budget Outlook and Options for Slowing the Growth of Health Care Costs]. Cbo.gov (June 17, 2008). Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall health care costs were projected in 2011 to increase by 5.8 percent annually from 2010 to 2020, in part because of increased utilization of medical services, higher prices for services, and new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2011/07/28/u-s-health-spending-projected-to-grow-5-8-percent-annually/ U.S. Health Spending Projected To Grow 5.8 Percent Annually – Health Affairs Blog]. Healthaffairs.org (July 28, 2011). Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Health care costs are rising across the board, but the cost of insurance has risen dramatically for families and employers as well as the federal government. In fact, since 1970 the per-capita cost of private coverage has grown roughly one percentage point faster each year than the per-capita cost of Medicare. Since the late 1990s, Medicare has performed especially well relative to private insurers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/tables.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127170317/http://www.cms.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/tables.pdf |archivedate=January 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next decade, Medicare's per capita spending is projected to grow at a rate of 2.5 percent each year, compared to private insurance's 4.8 percent.&lt;ref name="cms.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/proj2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309123319/https://www.cms.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/proj2010.pdf |archivedate=March 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, most experts and policymakers agree containing health care costs is essential to the nation's fiscal outlook. Much of the debate over the future of Medicare revolves around whether per capita costs should be reduced by limiting payments to providers or by shifting more costs to Medicare enrollees.

===Indicators===
Several measures serve as indicators of the long-term financial status of Medicare. These include total Medicare spending as a share of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), the solvency of the Medicare HI trust fund, Medicare per-capita spending growth relative to [[inflation]] and per-capita GDP growth; general fund revenue as a share of total Medicare spending; and actuarial estimates of unfunded liability over the 75-year timeframe and the infinite horizon (netting expected premium/tax revenue against expected costs). The major issue in all these indicators is comparing any future projections against current law vs. what the actuaries expect to happen. For example, current law specifies that Part A payments to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities will be cut substantially after 2028 and that doctors will get no raises after 2025. The actuaries expect that the law will change to keep these events from happening.

===Total Medicare spending as a share of GDP===
[[File:Medicare Cost and Non-Interest Income by Source as a Percentage of GDP.png|thumb|400px|right|Medicare Cost and Non-Interest Income by Source as a Percentage of GDP]]
This measure, which examines Medicare spending in the context of the US economy as a whole, is expected to increase from 3.6 percent in 2010 to 6.2 percent by 2090&lt;ref name="cms.gov"/&gt; under current law and over 9 percent under what the actuaries really expect will happen (called an "illustrative example" in recent-year Trustees Reports).

===The solvency of the Medicare HI trust fund===
This measure involves only Part A. The trust fund is considered insolvent when available revenue plus any existing balances will not cover 100 percent of annual projected costs. According to the latest estimate by the Medicare trustees (2016), the trust fund is expected to become insolvent in 11 years (2028), at which time available revenue will cover 87 percent of annual projected costs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;https://www.cms.gov/ReportsTrustFunds/downloads/tr2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since Medicare began, this solvency projection has ranged from two to 28 years, with an average of 11.3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS20946.pdf |title=Graph on Page 4 |format=PDF |accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicare per-capita spending growth relative to inflation and per-capita GDP growth===
The [[Independent Payment Advisory Board]] (IPAB), which the [[Affordable Care Act]] or "ACA" created, will use this measure to determine whether it must recommend to Congress proposals to reduce Medicare costs. Under the ACA, Congress established maximum targets, or thresholds, for per-capita Medicare spending growth. For the five-year periods ending in 2015 through 2019, these targets are based on the average of [[Consumer price index|CPI]]-U and CPI-M. For the five-year periods ending in 2020 and subsequent years, these targets are based on per-capita GDP growth plus one percentage point.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117044525/http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf |date=January 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the CMS Office of the Actuary must compare those two values, and if the spending measure is larger than the economic measure, IPAB must propose cost-savings recommendations for consideration in Congress on an expedited basis. The Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare per-capita spending growth will not exceed the economic target at any time between 2015 and 2021.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12119/03-30-HealthCareLegislation.pdf CBO | CBO's Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010]. Cbo.gov (March 30, 2011). Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 2016, these trigger points have never been reached and IPAB has not even been formed. However, in the 2016 Medicare Trustees Report, the actuaries estimate that the trigger points will be reached in 2016 or 2017 and that IPAB will affect Medicare spending for the first time in 2019 (meaning it will need to be formed and recommend its cuts in 2017).

===General fund revenue as a share of total Medicare spending===
This measure, established under the [[Medicare Modernization Act]] (MMA), examines Medicare spending in the context of the federal budget. Each year, MMA requires the Medicare trustees to make a determination about whether general fund revenue is projected to exceed 45 percent of total program spending within a seven-year period. If the Medicare trustees make this determination in two consecutive years, a "funding warning" is issued. In response, the president must submit cost-saving legislation to Congress, which must consider this legislation on an expedited basis. This threshold was reached and a warning issued every year between 2006 and 2013 but it has not been reached since that time and is not expected to be reached in the 2016-2022 "window." This is a reflection of the reduced spending growth mandated by the ACA according to the Trustees.

===Unfunded obligation===
Medicare's unfunded obligation is the total amount of money that would have to be set aside today such that the principal and interest would cover the gap between projected revenues (mostly Part B premiums and Part A payroll taxes to be paid over the timeframe under current law) and spending over a given timeframe. By law the timeframe used is 75 years though the Medicare actuaries also give an infinite-horizon estimate because life expectancy consistently increases and other economic factors underlying the estimates change.

As of January 1, 2016, Medicare's unfunded obligation over the 75 year timeframe is $3.8 trillion for the Part A Trust Fund and $28.6 trillion for Part B. Over an infinite timeframe the combined unfunded liability for both programs combined is over $50 trillion, with the difference primarily in the Part B estimate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/ReportsTrustFunds/downloads/tr2016.pdf|title=2016 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARDS OF TRUSTEES OF THE FEDERAL HOSPITAL INSURANCE AND FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTARY MEDICAL INSURANCE TRUST FUNDS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=cms.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; These estimates assume that CMS will pay full benefits as currently specified over those periods though that would be contrary to current United States law. In addition, as discussed throughout each annual Trustees' report, "the Medicare projections shown could be substantially understated as a result of other potentially unsustainable elements of current law." For example, current law effectively provides no raises for doctors after 2025; that is unlikely to happen. It is impossible for actuaries to estimate unfunded liability other than assuming current law is followed (except relative to benefits as noted), the Trustees state "that actual long-range present values for (Part A) expenditures and (Part B/D) expenditures and revenues could exceed the amounts estimated by a substantial margin."

===Public opinion===
Popular opinion surveys show that the public views Medicare's problems as serious, but not as urgent as other concerns. In January 2006, the [[Pew Research Center]] found 62 percent of the public said addressing Medicare's financial problems should be a high priority for the government, but that still put it behind other priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicagenda.org/citizen/issueguides/medicare/publicview/people-concerns |title=Medicare: People's Chief Concerns |publisher=[[Public agenda|Public Agenda]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys suggest that there's no public consensus behind any specific strategy to keep the program solvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicagenda.org/blogs/paying-for-quality-over-quantity-in-health-care-why-the-public-ought-to-be-engaged |title=Paying for Quality over Quantity in Health Care |publisher=[[Public agenda|Public Agenda]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraud and waste===

==Criticism==


Robert M. Ball, a former commissioner of Social Security under President Kennedy in 1961 (and later under Johnson, and Nixon) defined the major obstacle to financing health insurance for the elderly: the high cost of care for the aged combined with the generally low incomes of retired people. Because retired older people use much more medical care than younger employed people, an insurance premium related to the risk for older people needed to be high, but if the high premium had to be paid after retirement, when incomes are low, it was an almost impossible burden for the average person. The only feasible approach, he said, was to finance health insurance in the same way as cash benefits for retirement, by contributions paid while at work, when the payments are least burdensome, with the protection furnished in retirement without further payment.&lt;ref name="BALL"&gt;http://www.ssa.gov/history/churches.html The role of Social Insurance in preventing economic dependency ''Robert Ball speech 1961''&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s relatively few of the elderly had health insurance, and what they had was usually inadequate. Insurers such as [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross]], which had originally applied the principle of [[community rating]], faced competition from other commercial insurers that did not community rate, and so were forced to raise their rates for the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/14/4/62.pdf |title=Perspectives On Medicare: What Medicare's Architects Had In Mind |first=Robert M. |last=Ball |journal=[[Health Affairs]] |date=Winter 1995 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=62–72 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.14.4.62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicare is not generally an unearned entitlement. Entitlement is most commonly based on a record of contributions to the Medicare fund.&lt;!-- Unearned entitlement may occur for those that qualify without paying into the system, such as for those receiving SSI for more than one year, or with ESRD --&gt; As such it is a form of [[social insurance]] making it feasible for people to pay for insurance for sickness in old age when they are young and able to work and be assured of getting back benefits when they are older and no longer working. Some people will pay in more than they receive back and others will receive more benefits than they paid in.  Unlike private insurance where some amount must be paid to attain coverage, all eligible persons can receive coverage regardless of how much or if they had ever paid in.

===Politicized payment===
Bruce Vladeck, director of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Health Care Financing Administration]] in the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration, has argued that lobbyists have changed the Medicare program "from one that provides a legal entitlement to beneficiaries to one that provides a de facto political entitlement to providers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pope|first1=Chris|title=Medicare's Single-Payer Experience|url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/medicares-single-payer-experience|website=National Affairs|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality of beneficiary services===
A 2001 study by the [[Government Accountability Office]] evaluated the quality of responses given by Medicare contractor customer service representatives to provider (physician) questions. The evaluators assembled a list of questions, which they asked during a random sampling of calls to Medicare contractors. The rate of complete, accurate information provided by Medicare customer service representatives was 15%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d011141t.pdf Improvements Needed in Provider Communications and Contracting Procedures], Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Health, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, September 25, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, steps have been taken to improve the quality of customer service given by Medicare contractors, specifically the [https://archive.is/20131115022646/http://cms.hhs.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Training/1800medicare/index.html 1-800-MEDICARE] contractor.

===Hospital accreditation===
In most states the [[Joint Commission]], a private, [[non-profit organization]] for accrediting hospitals, decides whether or not a hospital is able to participate in Medicare, as currently there are no competitor organizations recognized by CMS.

Other organizations can also accredit hospitals for Medicare.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} These include the [[Community Health Accreditation Program]], the [[Accreditation Commission for Health Care]], [[the Compliance Team]] and the [[Healthcare Quality Association on Accreditation]].

Accreditation is voluntary and an organization may choose to be evaluated by their State Survey Agency or by CMS directly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vdh.state.va.us/OLC/Laws/documents/HomeCare/Accreditation%20Option%20for%20Medicare%20payments.pdf The Accreditation Option for Deemed Medicare Status], Office of Licensure and Certification, Virginia Department of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduate medical education===
Medicare funds the vast majority of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] training in the US. This tax-based financing covers resident salaries and benefits through payments called Direct Medical Education payments. Medicare also uses taxes for Indirect Medical Education, a subsidy paid to [[teaching hospital]]s in exchange for training resident physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Medicare funding for medical education: a waste of money? |last=Gottlieb |first=Scott |date=November 1997 |journal=[[USA Today (magazine)|USA Today]] }}.

At the same time the cost of medical services continue rising rapidly and many geographic areas face physician shortages, both trends suggesting the supply of physicians remains too low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/295/9/1042 |title=Shortages of Medical Personnel at Community Health Centers |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |date=March 1, 2006 |volume=295 |issue=9 |first1=Roger A. |last1=Rosenblatt |first2=C.

Medicare thus finds itself in the odd position of having assumed control of the single largest funding source for graduate medical education, currently facing major budget constraints, and as a result, freezing funding for graduate medical education, as well as for physician reimbursement rates.  This has forced hospitals to look for alternative sources of funding for residency slots.&lt;ref name= amednews2006-01-30 /&gt; This halt in funding in turn exacerbates the exact problem Medicare sought to solve in the first place: improving the availability of medical care. However, some healthcare administration experts believe that the shortage of physicians may be an opportunity for providers to reorganize their delivery systems to become less costly and more efficient. Physician assistants and Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners may begin assuming more responsibilities that traditionally fell to doctors, but do not necessarily require the advanced training and skill of a physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prognosis Worsens For Shortages In Primary Care |last=Rovner |first=Julie |date=August 2012 |journal=[[Talk of the Nation]] }}.

In 1977, the [[Health Care Financing Administration]] (HCFA) was established as a federal agency responsible for the administration of Medicare and Medicaid. This would be renamed to [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) in 2001. By 1983, the [[diagnosis-related group]] (DRG) replaced pay for service reimbursements to hospitals for Medicare patients.

President [[Bill Clinton]] attempted an overhaul of Medicare through his [[1993 Clinton health care plan|health care reform plan]] in 1993–1994 but was unable to get the legislation passed by Congress.

In 2003 [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]], which President [[George W. Bush]] signed into law on December 8, 2003. Part of this legislation included filling gaps in prescription-drug coverage left by the Medicare Secondary Payer Act that was enacted in 1980. The 2003 bill strengthened the Workers' Compensation Medicare Set-Aside Program (WCMSA) that is monitored and administered by CMS.

On August 1, 2007, the US House [[United States Congress]] voted to reduce payments to Medicare Advantage providers in order to pay for expanded coverage of children's health under the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|SCHIP]] program. As of 2008, Medicare Advantage plans cost, on average, 13 percent more per person insured for like beneficiaries than direct payment plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Aliza |last=Marcus |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&amp;sid=a8.4kZl7x03E&amp;refer=home |title=Senate Vote on Doctor Fees Carries Risks for McCain |newspaper=Bloomberg News |date=July 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many health economists have concluded that payments to Medicare Advantage providers have been excessive. The Senate, after heavy lobbying from the insurance industry, declined to agree to the cuts in Medicare Advantage proposed by the House. President Bush subsequently vetoed the SCHIP extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/health/policy/02health.html |title=House Passes Children's Health Plan 225–204 |newspaper=New York Times |date=August 2, 2007 |last=Pear |first=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act===
The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] ("PPACA") of 2010 made a number of changes to the Medicare program. Several provisions of the law were designed to reduce the cost of Medicare. The most substantial provisions slowed the growth rate of payments to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities under Parts A of Medicare, through a variety of methods (e.g., arbitrary percentage cuts, penalties for readmissions).

Congress also attempted to reduce payments to public Part C Medicare health plans by aligning the rules that establish Part C plans' capitated fees more closely with the FFS paid for comparable care to "similar beneficiaries" under Parts A and B of Medicare. Primarily these reductions involved much discretion on the part of CMS and examples of what CMS did included effectively ending a Part C program Congress had previously initiated to increase the use of Part C in rural areas (the so-called Part C PFFS plan) and reducing over time a program that encouraged employers and unions to create their own Part C plans not available to the general Medicare beneficiary base (so-called Part C EGWP plans) by providing higher reimbursement. These two types of Part C plans had been identified by MedPAC as the programs that most negatively affected parity between the cost of Medicare beneficiaries on Parts A/B/C and the costs of beneficiaries not on Parts A/B/C. These efforts to reach parity have been more than successful. As of 2015, all beneficiaries on A/B/C cost 4% less per person than all beneficiaries not on A/B/C. But whether that is because the cost of the former decreased or the cost of the latter increased is not known.

PPACA also slightly reduced annual increases in payments to physicians and to hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. Along with other minor adjustments, these changes reduced Medicare's projected cost over the next decade by $455 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12033/12-23-selectedhealthcarepublications.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the PPACA created the [[Independent Payment Advisory Board]] ("IPAB"), which is empowered to submit legislative proposals to reduce the cost of Medicare if the program's per-capita spending grows faster than per-capita GDP plus one percent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; While the IPAB would be barred from rationing care, raising revenue, changing benefits or eligibility, increasing cost sharing, or cutting payments to hospitals, its creation has been one of the more controversial aspects of health reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health/controversial-health-board-braces-for-continued-battles-over-medicare/2011/05/03/AFR2ZwTG_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Bara | last=Vaida | title=Controversial health board braces for continued battles over Medicare | date=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Medicare Trustees projected that the IPAB will have to convene in 2017 and make cuts effective in 2019.

The PPACA also made some changes to Medicare enrollee's' benefits. By 2020, it will close the so-called "donut hole" between Part D plans' coverage limits and the catastrophic cap on out-of-pocket spending, reducing a Part D enrollee's' exposure to the cost of prescription drugs by an average of $2,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratehospitals.com/blog/how-will-the-affordable-care-act-change-medicare/|title=How will the Affordable Care Act Change Medicare?|publisher=Ratehospitals.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lowered costs for about 5% of the people on Medicare. Limits were also placed on out-of-pocket costs for in-network care for public Part C health plan enrollees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2011/02/medicare02102011a.html|title=Shining a Light on Health Insurance Rate Increases&amp;nbsp;– Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|work=Healthcare.gov|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these plans had such a limit but ACA formalized the annual out of pocket spend limit. Beneficiaries on traditional Medicare do not get such a limit but can effectively arrange for one through private insurance.

Meanwhile, Medicare Part B and D premiums were restructured in ways that reduced costs for most people while raising contributions from the wealthiest people with Medicare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/8126.pdf|title=Income-Relating Medicare Part B and Part D Premiums: How Many Medicare Beneficiaries Will Be Affected? | publisher=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation|work=Kff.org|format=PDF|date=November 30, 2010|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law also expanded coverage of or eliminated co-pays for some preventive services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/rights/preventive-care/index.html |title=Health care law rights and protections; 10 benefits for you |work=HealthCare.gov |date=March 23, 2010 |accessdate=July 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619173358/http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/rights/preventive-care/index.html |archivedate=June 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PPACA instituted a number of measures to control Medicare fraud and abuse, such as longer oversight periods, provider screenings, stronger standards for certain providers, the creation of databases to share data between federal and state agencies, and stiffer penalties for violators. The law also created mechanisms, such as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to fund experiments to identify new payment and delivery models that could conceivably be expanded to reduce the cost of health care while improving quality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Proposals for reforming Medicare===
As legislators continue to seek new ways to control the cost of Medicare, a number of new proposals to reform Medicare have been introduced in recent years.

'''Premium support'''

Since the mid-1990s, there have been a number of proposals to change Medicare from a publicly run social insurance program with a defined benefit, for which there is no limit to the government's expenses, into a program that offers "premium support" for enrollees.&lt;ref name=Aaron&gt;[Henry Aaron and Robert Reischauer, "The Medicare reform debate: what is the next step?" Health Affairs 1995;14:8–30]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AaronFrakt"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aaron |first1=Henry |last2=Frakt |first2=Austin |year=2012 |title=Why Now Is Not the Time for Premium Support |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=366|issue=10|pages=877–79|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1200448 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1200448#t=article |accessdate=September 11, 2012 |pmid=22276779}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic concept behind the proposals is that the government would make a defined contribution, that is a premium support, to the health plan of a Medicare enrollee's choice. Insurers would compete to provide Medicare benefits and this competition would set the level of fixed contribution. Additionally, enrollees would be able to purchase greater coverage by paying more in addition to the fixed government contribution. Conversely, enrollees could choose lower cost coverage and keep the difference between their coverage costs and the fixed government contribution.&lt;ref name="Moffit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/2012/08/premium-support-medicares-future-and-its-critics#_ftn8 |title=Premium Support: Medicare's Future and its Critics |author=Robert Moffit |date=August 7, 2012 |work=heritage.org |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urban.org/uploadedpdf/309232_medicare_comp.pdf |title=Can Competition Improve Medicare? A Look at Premium Support |author=Marilyn Moon |date=September 1999 |work=urban.org |publisher=Urban Institute |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of premium Medicare plans is for greater cost-effectiveness; if such a proposal worked as planned, the financial incentive would be greatest for Medicare plans that offer the best care at the lowest cost.&lt;ref name=Aaron/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moon/&gt;

There have been a number of criticisms of the premium support model. Some have raised concern about risk selection, where insurers find ways to avoid covering people expected to have high health care costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frakt|first=Austin|title=Premium support proposal and critique: Objection 1, risk selection|url=http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/premium-support-proposal-and-critique-objection-1-risk-selection/|work=[[The Incidental Economist]]|accessdate=October 20, 2013|date=December 13, 2011|quote=[...] The concern is that private plans will find ways to attract relatively healthier and cheaper-to-cover beneficiaries (the "good" risks), leaving the sicker and more costly ones (the "bad" risks) in TM. Attracting good risks is known as "favorable selection" and attracting "bad" ones is "adverse selection." [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premium support proposals, such as the 2011 plan proposed by [[Paul Ryan|Rep. Paul Ryan]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]–[[Wisconsin|Wis.]]), have aimed to avoid risk selection by including protection language mandating that plans participating in such coverage must provide insurance to all beneficiaries and are not able to avoid covering higher risk beneficiaries.&lt;ref name="PolitiFact"&gt;{{cite news |title=Debbie Wasserman Schultz says Ryan Medicare plan would allow insurers to use pre-existing conditions as barrier to coverage |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/01/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-ryan-medicare-plan-w/ |work=PolitiFact |date=June 1, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics are concerned that the Medicare population, which has particularly high rates of cognitive impairment and dementia, would have a hard time choosing between competing health plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frakt|first=Austin|title=Premium support proposal and critique: Objection 4, complexity|url=http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/premium-support-proposal-and-critique-objection-4-complexity/|work=[[The Incidental Economist]]|accessdate=October 20, 2013|date=December 16, 2011|quote=[...] Medicare is already very complex, some say too complex. There is research that suggests beneficiaries have difficulty making good choices among the myriad of available plans. [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Moffit, a senior fellow of [[The Heritage Foundation]] responded to this concern, stating that while there may be research indicating that individuals have difficulty making the correct choice of health care plan, there is no evidence to show that government officials can make better choices.&lt;ref name=Moffit/&gt; Henry Aaron, one of the original proponents of premium supports, has recently argued that the idea should not be implemented, given that [[Medicare Advantage]] plans have not successfully contained costs more effectively than traditional Medicare and because the political climate is hostile to the kinds of regulations that would be needed to make the idea workable.&lt;ref name=AaronFrakt/&gt;

Two distinct premium support systems have recently been proposed in Congress to control the cost of Medicare. [[The Path to Prosperity|The House Republicans' 2012 budget]] would have abolished traditional Medicare and required the eligible population to purchase private insurance with a newly created premium support program. This plan would have cut the cost of Medicare by capping the value of the voucher and tying its growth to inflation, which is expected to be lower than rising health costs, saving roughly $155 billion over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horney|first=James R.|date=April 8, 2011|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3458|title=Ryan Budget Plan Produces Far Less Real Deficit Cutting than Reported – Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|work=Cbpp.org|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Ryan, the plan's author, claimed that competition would drive down costs,&lt;ref name="budget.house.gov" /&gt; but the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) found that the plan would dramatically raise the cost of health care, with all of the additional costs falling on enrollees. The CBO found that under the plan, typical 65-year-olds would go from paying 35 percent of their health care costs to paying 68 percent by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12128/04-05-ryan_letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, Ryan and [[Ron Wyden|Sen. Ron Wyden]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]–[[Oregon|Oreg.]]) jointly proposed a new premium support system. Unlike Ryan's original plan, this new system would maintain traditional Medicare as an option, and the premium support would not be tied to inflation.&lt;ref&gt;http://paulryan.house.gov/UploadedFiles/WydenRyan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The spending targets in the Ryan-Wyden plan are the same as the targets included in the Affordable Care Act; it is unclear whether the plan would reduce Medicare expenditure relative to current law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van|first=Paul N.|date=December 21, 2011|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3645|title=Ryan-Wyden Premium Support Proposal Not What It May Seem – Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|work=Cbpp.org|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raising the age of eligibility'''

A number of different plans have been introduced that would raise the age of Medicare eligibility.&lt;ref name="budget.house.gov"&gt;http://budget.house.gov/UploadedFiles/PathToProsperityFY2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs-images.forbes.com/aroy/files/2012/02/Seniors-Choice-Act-Summary.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713023317/http://blogs-images.forbes.com/aroy/files/2012/02/Seniors-Choice-Act-Summary.pdf|title=Seniors Choice Act Summary|format=PDF|date=February 2012|archivedate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://paulryan.house.gov/UploadedFiles/rivlinryan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/CoChair_Draft.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that, as the population ages and the ratio of workers to retirees increases, programs for the elderly need to be reduced. Since the age at which Americans can retire with full Social Security benefits is rising to 67, it is argued that the age of eligibility for Medicare should rise with it (though people can begin receiving reduced Social Security benefits as early as age 62).

The CBO projected that raising the age of Medicare eligibility would save $113 billion over 10 years after accounting for the necessary expansion of Medicaid and state health insurance exchange subsidies under health care reform, which are needed to help those who could not afford insurance purchase it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] found that raising the age of eligibility would save the federal government $5.7 billion a year, while raising costs for other payers. According to Kaiser, raising the age would cost $3.7 billion to 65- and 66-year-olds, $2.8 billion to other consumers whose premiums would rise as insurance pools absorbed more risk, $4.5 billion to employers offering insurance, and $0.7 billion to states expanding their Medicaid rolls. Ultimately Kaiser found that the plan would raise total social costs by more than twice the savings to the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/8169.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117060326/http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/8169.pdf |date=January 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negotiating the prices of prescription drugs'''

Currently, people with Medicare can get prescription drug coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan or through the standalone private prescription drug plans (PDPs) established under Medicare Part D. Each plan established its own coverage policies and independently negotiates the prices it pays to drug manufacturers. But because each plan has a much smaller coverage pool than the entire Medicare program, many argue that this system of paying for prescription drugs undermines the government's bargaining power and artificially raises the cost of drug coverage.

Many look to the [[Veterans Health Administration]] as a model of lower cost prescription drug coverage. Since the VHA provides healthcare directly, it maintains its own formulary and negotiates prices with manufacturers. Studies show that the VHA pays dramatically less for drugs than the PDP plans Medicare Part D subsidizes.&lt;ref&gt;Families USA, No Bargain: Medicare Drug Plans Deliver High Prices (Washington, DC: Jan. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="law.umaryland.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/crsreports/crsdocuments/RS2205902182005.pdf|title=The Pros and Cons of Allowing the Federal Government to Negotiate Prescription Drug Prices|work=law.umaryland.edu|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; One analysis found that adopting a formulary similar to the VHA's would save Medicare $14 billion a year (over 10 years the savings would be around $140 billion).&lt;ref&gt;Austin B. Frakt, Steven D. Pizer, and Roger Feldman. "Should Medicare Adopt the Veterans Health Administration Formulary?" Health Economics (April 19, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other proposals for savings on prescription drugs that do not require such fundamental changes to Medicare Part D's payment and coverage policies. Manufacturers who supply drugs to Medicaid are required to offer a 15 percent rebate on the average manufacturer's price. Low-income elderly individuals who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid receive drug coverage through Medicare Part D, and no reimbursement is paid for the drugs the government purchases for them. Reinstating that rebate would yield savings of $112 billion, according to a recent CBO estimate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12085/03-10-reducingthedeficit.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have questioned the ability of the federal government to achieve greater savings than the largest PDPs, since some of the larger plans have coverage pools comparable to Medicare's, though the evidence from the VHA is promising. Some also worry that controlling the prices of prescription drugs would reduce incentives for manufacturers to invest in R&amp;D, though the same could be said of anything that would reduce costs.&lt;ref name="law.umaryland.edu"/&gt;

'''Reforming care for the "[[Medicare dual eligible|dual-eligibles]]"'''

Roughly nine million Americans—mostly older adults with low incomes—are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These men and women tend to have particularly poor health – more than half are being treated for five or more chronic conditions&lt;ref name="ahipcoverage.com"&gt;Kenneth E. Thorpe, "Estimated Federal Savings Associated with Care Coordination Models for Medicare-Medicaid Dual Eligibles." America's Health Insurance Plans, September 2011. http://www.ahipcoverage.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Dual-Eligible-Study-September-2011.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013072459/http://www.ahipcoverage.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Dual-Eligible-Study-September-2011.pdf |date=October 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—and high costs. Average annual per-capita spending for "dual-eligibles" is $20,000,&lt;ref&gt;Dual Eligible: Medicaid's Role for Low-Income Beneficiaries", Kaiser Family Foundation, Fact Sheet #4091-07, December 2010, http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/4091-07.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to $10,900 for the Medicare population as a whole all enrollees.&lt;ref&gt;CMS, National Health Expenditure Web Tables, Table 16. {{cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/tables.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127170317/http://www.cms.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/tables.pdf |archivedate=January 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dual-eligible population comprises roughly 20 percent of Medicare's enrollees but accounts for 36 percent of its costs.&lt;ref&gt;Medicare Chartbook, Kaiser Family Foundation, November 2010, 55&lt;/ref&gt; There is substantial evidence that these individuals receive highly inefficient care because responsibility for their care is split between the Medicare and Medicaid programs&lt;ref&gt;John Holahan, Linda J. Blumberg, Stacey McMorrow, Stephen Zuckerman, Timothy Waidmann, and Karen Stockley, "Containing the Growth of Spending in the U.S. Health System," The Urban Institute, October 2011. http://www.urban.org/uploadedpdf/412419-Containing-the-Growth-of-Spending-in-the-US-Health-System.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;—most see a number of different providers without any kind of mechanism to coordinate their care, and they face high rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang HJ, Wier LM, Potter DEB, Burgess J. Hospitalizations for Potentially Preventable Conditions among Medicare-Medicaid Dual Eligibles, 2008. Statistical Brief #96. Rockville, MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Medicaid and Medicare cover different aspects of health care, both have a financial incentive to shunt patients into care the other program pays for.

Many experts have suggested that establishing mechanisms to coordinate care for the dual-eligibles could yield substantial savings in the Medicare program, mostly by reducing hospitalizations. Such programs would connect patients with primary care, create an individualized health plan, assist enrollees in receiving social and human services as well as medical care, reconcile medications prescribed by different doctors to ensure they do not undermine one another, and oversee behavior to improve health.&lt;ref&gt;Medicare PPayment Advisory Commission, MedPAC 2011 Databook, Chapter 5. {{cite web|url=http://www.medpac.gov/chapters/Jun11_Ch05.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113143043/http://www.medpac.gov/chapters/Jun11_Ch05.pdf |archivedate=November 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general ethos of these proposals is to "treat the patient, not the condition,"&lt;ref name="ahipcoverage.com"/&gt; and maintain health while avoiding costly treatments.

There is some controversy over who exactly should take responsibility for coordinating the care of the dual eligibles. There have been some proposals to transfer dual eligibles into existing Medicaid managed care plans, which are controlled by individual states.&lt;ref&gt;The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, "The Moment of Truth." December 2010. pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; But many states facing severe budget shortfalls might have some incentive to stint on necessary care or otherwise shift costs to enrollees and their families to capture some Medicaid savings. Medicare has more experience managing the care of older adults, and is already expanding coordinated care programs under the ACA,&lt;ref&gt;Judy Feder, Lisa Clemans-Cope, Teresa Coughlin, John Holahan, Timothy Waidmann, "Refocusing Responsibility For Dual Eligibles: Why Medicare Should Take The Lead." Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, October 2011. http://www.rwjf.org/files/research/72868qs68dualeligiblesfull20110930.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; though there are some questions about private Medicare plans' capacity to manage care and achieve meaningful cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;Families USA, "A Guide for Advocates: State Demonstrations to Integrate Medicare and Medicaid."

Estimated savings from more effective coordinated care for the dual eligibles range from $125 billion&lt;ref name="ahipcoverage.com"/&gt; to over $200 billion,&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Berenson and John Holahan, Preserving Medicare: A Practical Approach to Controlling Spending (Washington, DC: Urban Institute, Sept. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; mostly by eliminating unnecessary, expensive hospital admissions.

'''Income-relating Medicare premiums'''

Both House Republicans and President Obama proposed increasing the additional premiums paid by the wealthiest people with Medicare, compounding several reforms in the ACA that would increase the number of wealthier individuals paying higher, income-related Part B and Part D premiums. Such proposals are projected to save $20 billion over the course of a decade,&lt;ref&gt;The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, "The Moment of Truth." December 2010. {{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/jointcommitteereport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308072058/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/jointcommitteereport.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and would ultimately result in more than a quarter of Medicare enrollees paying between 35 and 90 percent of their Part B costs by 2035, rather than the typical 25 percent. If the brackets mandated for 2035 were implemented today,{{When|date=December 2013}} it would mean that anyone earning more than $47,000 (as an individual) or $94,000 (as a couple) would be affected. Under the Republican proposals, affected individuals would pay 40 percent of the total Part B and Part D premiums, which would be equivalent of $2,500 today.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation, "Income-Relating Medicare Part B and Part D Premiums Under Current Law and Recent Proposals: What are the Implications for Beneficiaries?" February 2012. http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/8276.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

More limited income-relation of premiums only raises limited revenue. Currently, only 5 percent of Medicare enrollees pay an income-related premium, and most only pay 35 percent of their total premium, compared to the 25 percent most people pay. Only a negligible number of enrollees fall into the higher income brackets required to bear a more substantial share of their costs—roughly half a percent of individuals and less than three percent of married couples currently pay more than 35 percent of their total Part B costs.&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Administration, Income of the Population, 55 and Older&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some concern that tying premiums to income would weaken Medicare politically over the long run, since people tend to be more supportive of universal social programs than of [[means test|means-tested]] ones.&lt;ref&gt;Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williams. The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism. Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medigap restrictions'''

Some Medicare supplemental insurance (or "Medigap") plans cover all of an enrollee's cost-sharing, insulating them from any out-of-pocket costs and guaranteeing financial security to individuals with significant health care needs. Many policymakers believe that such plans raise the cost of Medicare by creating a [[perverse incentive]] that leads patients to seek unnecessary, costly treatments. Many argue that unnecessary treatments are a major cause of rising costs and propose that people with Medicare should feel more of the cost of their care to create incentives to seek the most efficient alternatives. Various restrictions and surcharges on Medigap coverage have appeared in recent deficit reduction proposals.&lt;ref&gt;National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, "The Moment of Truth," December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Office of Management and Buddget, "Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future: The President's Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction." September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen. Tom Coburn and Sen. Richard Burr, "The Seniors' Choice Act," February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the furthest-reaching reforms proposed, which would prevent Medigap from covering any of the first $500 of coinsurance charges and limit it to covering 50 percent of all costs beyond that, could save $50 billion over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;CBO, "Reducing the Deficit: Revenue and Spending Options," May 2012. Option 21&lt;/ref&gt; But it would also increase health care costs substantially for people with costly health care needs.

There is some evidence that claims of Medigap's tendency to cause over-treatment may be exaggerated and that potential savings from restricting it might be smaller than expected.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Lemieux, Teresa Chovan, and Karen Heath, "Medigap Coverage And Medicare Spending: A Second Look," Health Affairs, Volume 27, Number 2, March/April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, there are some concerns about the potential effects on enrollees. Individuals who face high charges with every episode of care have been shown to delay or forgo needed care, jeopardizing their health and possibly increasing their health care costs down the line.&lt;ref&gt;Beeuwkes Buntin M, Haviland AM, McDevitt R, and Sood N, "Healthcare Spending and Preventive Care in High-Deductible and Consumer-Directed Health Plans," American Journal of Managed Care, Vol. 17, No. 3, March 2011, pp. 222–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Given their lack of medical training, most patients tend to have difficulty distinguishing between necessary and unnecessary treatments. The problem could be exaggerated among the Medicare population, which has low levels of health literacy.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Nature Nanotechnology 2008 09;3(9):527–528.&lt;/ref&gt; There are traditional methods that are used to extract mercury from the natural water sources and industrial waste water, such as [[chemical precipitation]], [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgamation]], [[reverse osmosis]], [[membrane filtration]] and photochemical methods.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker P. Purification at the Nano Scale. The Futurist 2011 Jul;45(4):11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. W. Chang, "Neurotoxic effects of mercury—A review," Environmental Research, vol. 14, no. 3, pp. 329–373, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Q. Wang, D. Kim, D. D. Dionysiou, G. A. Sorial, and D. Timberlake, "Sources and remediation for mercury contamination in aquatic systems—a literature review," Environmental Pollution, vol. 131, no. 2, pp. 323–336, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these methods are expensive, time consuming, and inefficient, hence the need for a nanofiltration technology that overcomes all of these issues.  Nanofiltration technology is very efficient in removal of mercury species due to its characteristics of having high surface area-to-volume and the fact that it's easily chemically functionalized.&lt;ref&gt;Hashim MA, Mukhopadhyay S, Sahu NJ, Sengupta B. Remediation Technologies for Heavy Metal Contaminated Groundwater. Journal of Environmental Management. 2011, June 25; 92(2011): 2355–2388.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Brownian motion of nanomaterials allows them to scan large volume of solvent in short times. There are many copolymer nanoparticles (NPs) that can be used as scavengers to eliminate mercury species via redox reactions such as selenium NPs, manganese dioxide nanowhiskers, carbon nanotube−silverNP composites, silver NPs, silver NP-decorated silicaspheres, gold NP-based materials.  Among these adsorbents, citrate-capped gold NP-based materials have been used intensively to capture mercury species from nature water.

'''Instrumentation'''

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is used to obtain the HRTEM images (FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin working at 200 kV) and double beam UV-visible spectrophotometer is used for the extinction, or removal, of the NPs gold spectra.&lt;ref&gt;Shih YC, Ke CY, Yu CJ, Lu CY, Tseng WL. Combined tween 20-stabilized gold nanoparticles and reduced graphite oxide-Fe3O4 nanoparticle composites for rapid and efficient removal of mercury species from a complex matrix. ACS Applied Mater Interfaces 2014 October 22; 6(20): 17437-17445.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of scanning electron microscope and an energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) for obtaining EDX spectra while sub micrometer particle size analyzer and Delsa nano zeta potential measure the potential of gold NPs. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measures the quantification of mercury species in gold NPs while the linear range of Hg2+ should be between 2.5 and 50 nM. The powder X-ray diffraction is measured using a diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. A superconducting quantum interference device measures the magnetometry while the Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy spectrum is measured by a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer.

'''Removal of mercury species'''
[[File:Mercurynanotrapfigure2.png|thumb|Figure 2: Procedure associated with the removal of Hg2+ by the combination of Tween 20-Au NPs and reduced graphite-Fe3O4 NP composites]]

The application of an external magnetic field helps reduce the Fe3O4 NP compositions and can be used to remove the citrate capped gold NPs or Tween 20- Au NPs. The quantity of the Hg2+ is determined by ICP-MS. Elimination efficiency is calculated as:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;Elimination Efficiency (%) = [(Co – C)/ Co] x 100&lt;/div&gt;

The equilibrium absorption capacity was determined by:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;qe = (Co – Ce) x (V/W)&lt;/div&gt;

where qe is the equilibrium absorption capacity, Ce is the concentration of Hg2+, V is the volume of the solution and W is the weight of Tween 20-Au NPs. Other metals in place of mercury can be used to determine the reusability of the nanofiltration method. A simple nanofiltration process is illustrated in Figure 2.

[[File:Mercurynanotrapfigure3.png|thumb|Figure 3:A highly porous framework such as water is treated with mercury chelating groups, which serve as the "mercury nano trap". These chelating groups hold tightly onto Hg (II) ions, removing it from the water.]]When purifying mercury from sea water, a decrease in the volume to surface area ratio leads to a decline in the efficiency of the elimination.7 Cost efficiency of the nanotrap process is indicated in the fact that the materials can be reused to recycle more water. Tween 20-Au NPs are rapid, efficient and selective in capturing Hg2+ in high salt water concentration when the gold NPs catalyze the citrate ion induced reduction of Hg2+ to Hg0.&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Zhang, J. O. Nriagu, and H. Itoh, "Mercury removal from water using activated carbons derived from organic sewage sludge," Water Research, vol. 39, no. 2–3, pp. 389–395, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; ICP-MS is used to quantify the Hg2+ concentration to determine the level of elimination efficiency. Figure 3 shows an illustration process of the nano trap filtration process.

The use of nanomaterials in removing the mercury from water is advantageous because of the high surface area to volume ratio and the fact that they are easily chemically functionalized. Nanomaterials capture five times more mercury than the maximum mercury captured predicted through the use of previous mercury filtration systems.&lt;ref&gt;Kuriyama M, Haruta K, Dairaku T, Kawamura T, Kikkawa S, Inamoto K, Tsukamoto H, Kondo Y, Torigoe H, Okamoto I, Ono A, Morita EH, Tanaka Y: Hg2+-trapping beads: Hg2+-specific recognition through thymine-Hg(II)-thymine base pairing. Chem Pharm Bull; 2014;62(7):709–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other NP-based methods for Hg2+ removal from high salt matrix, Tween 20-Au NPs is a rapid and selective technique with high efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Ojea-Jiménez, Xicoténcatl López, Jordi Arbiol, and Victor Puntes: Citrate-Coated Gold Nanoparticles As Smart Scavengers for Mercury(II) Removal from Polluted Waters.

One author describes the syndromes of chronic testicular pain thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The complaint is of a squeezing deep ache in the testis like the day after you got kicked there, often bilateral or alternating from one side to the other, intermittent, and, most commonly, associated with lower back pain.  Sometimes it feels like the testicle is pinched in the crotch of the underwear but trouser readjustment does not help.  There may also be pain in the [[Inguinal canal|inguinal]] area but no nausea or other symptoms.  Back pain may be concurrent or absent and some patients have a long history of low back pain.  Onset of pain is commonly related to activity that would stress the low back such as lifting heavy objects.  Other stresses that might cause low back pain are imaginative coital positions, jogging, sitting hunched over a computer, long car driving, or other such positions of unsupported seating posture that flattens the normal lumbar [[lordosis]] curve."&lt;ref name=baran&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1563">The '''ProRec''' initiative of 1996 was a network of national non-profit organisations (the "ProRec centres"). The initiative was a consequence of the conclusions of the Concerted Action MEDIREC (1994-1995) regarding the reasons why [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) systems were not used more widely in any of the [[European Union]]. As part of the [[Lisbon Strategy|Lisbon Declaration]] suggestions were made to remedy this situation.

The ProRec initiative is supported by the [[Directorate-General for Information Society and Media (European Commission)|DG Information Society]] of the [[European Union]]. The DG Information Society supported the ProRec initiative with the ProRec Support Action (1996-1998), and the WIDENET Accompanying Measure (2000-2003).

The goal of the initiative is to build awareness of the limitations, shortcomings and obstacles on the way towards widespread development, implementation and use of quality Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and pointing them out. Especially significant for implementing Electronic Health Record systems is the ability to communicate and interoperate.

The '''Rehabilitation Services Administration''' ('''RSA''') is a federal agency under the [[United States Department of Education]], [[Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services]],&lt;ref name=aboutOSERS&gt;{{cite web |title=About OSERS |date=26 April 2016 |website=U.S. Department of Education |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/aboutus.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is headquartered within the Department of Education in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=contactRSA&gt;{{cite web |title= RSA, Contact and Feedback |date=9 September 2014 |website=U.S. Department of Education |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/rsa/contact.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=contactED&gt;{{cite web |title= Contact Us &amp; General Inquiries |date=9 September 2014 |website=U.S. Department of Education |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/gen/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established to administer portions of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]].&lt;ref name=aboutRSA&gt;{{cite web |title=About RSA |date=7 August 2015 |website=U.S. Department of Education |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/rsa/about.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is to provide leadership and resources to assist state and other agencies in providing vocational rehabilitation (VR) and other services to individuals with disabilities to maximize their employment, independence and integration into the community and the competitive labor market.&lt;ref name=OurMission&gt;{{cite web |title=About RSA |date=7 May 2017 |website=U.S. Department of Education |url=https://ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/rsa/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RSA is charged with:
administering formula and discretionary grant programs authorized by Congress;
evaluating, monitoring, and reporting on the implementation of Federal policy and programs and the effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation, supported employment, and other related programs for individuals with disabilities;
coordinating with other Federal agencies, State agencies, and the private sector including professional organizations, service providers, and organizations of persons with disabilities for the review of program planning, implementation, and monitoring issues&lt;ref name=Responsibilities&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Charge |date=7 May 2017 |website=U.S. Department of Education |url=https://rsa.ed.gov/index.cfm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RSA provides national leadership for, and administration of:
basic state and formula grant programs -- including grants to state [[vocational rehabilitation]] agencies --,
rehabilitation training discretionary grant programs,
[[Randolph-Sheppard Act]] vending facilities,&lt;ref name="Sec. 107 - Operation of vending facilities"&gt;{{cite web |title=20 U.S.C. |date=7 May 2017 |website=U.S. Government Printing Office |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title20/html/USCODE-2011-title20-chap6A-sec107.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
[[Helen Keller National Center]] (CITE) programs.&lt;ref name="CHAPTER 21 - HELEN KELLER NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTHS AND ADULTS WHO ARE DEAF-BLIND"&gt;{{cite web |title=29 U.S.C. |date=7 May 2017 |website=U.S. Government Printing Office |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title29/html/USCODE-2011-title29-chap21.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grant programs under the RSA’s purview are in various areas such as technical assistance centers, demonstration projects, training, client advocacy, and underserved populations.&lt;ref name="RSA Programs and Projects"&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Department of Education |date=7 May 2017 |website=U.S. Government Printing Office |url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/rsa/programs.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The largest program the RSA manages is the State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program, which mainly assists in engage in gainful employment. If a state is unable to serve all disabled individuals, priority is given to individuals with the most significant disabilities.

==History==
Prior to the establishment of the RSA, the passage of legislation played a key role in laying the groundwork for the federal and state partnership. The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] in 1917 helped to establish the Federal Board for Vocational Education, which would later regulate the veteran and civilian vocational rehabilitation programs. Coinciding with World War I, The Federal Board for Vocational Education oversaw a vocational rehabilitation program for disabled veterans under the Soldier’s Rehabilitation Act of 1918. In the 1920s, the Smith-Fess Act expanded the purview of the Federal Board for Vocational Rehabilitation to oversee a civilian vocational rehabilitation program to be funded on a 50-50 matching basis with the states. Congress would need to periodically vote to extend funding because it was not permanent at this time.&lt;ref name="Vocational rehabilitation: history and practice"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vocational rehabilitation: history and practice |date=7 May 2017 |website=Vocational rehabilitation: history and practice |url=http://people.cehd.tamu.edu/~telliott/documents/VocationalRehab%20chapter.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Randolph–Sheppard Act]] in 1936 and the [[Wagner-O'Day Act]] in 1938 helped to prioritize employment of visually impaired individuals to operate vending stands in federal buildings, and required federal agencies to buy certain products from nonprofit organizations that employed people who are blind, respectively. These acts gave way to the establishment of the National Industries for the Blind. The National Industries for the Blind employed blind Americans who made and sold products under the business name [[Skilcraft]].

==Vocational Rehabilitation Act Amendments==
In 1954, Public Law 565 &lt;ref name="Public Law 565"&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Law 565 |date=7 May 2017 |website=U.S. Government Printing Office |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-68/pdf/STATUTE-68-Pg652.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; increased the 50-50 matched funding from the federal government to 3 federal dollars for every 2 state dollars, and expanded services to those with intellectual disabilities. The Act authorized grants for research and educational training for rehabilitation counselors-to-be in universities. As the Director of the U.S. Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, [[Mary Switzer]] released funds for more than 100 university-based rehabilitation-related programs and was a strong advocate for improving quality of life for people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Disability History Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability History Timeline |date=7 May 2017 |website=Institute on Disabilities at Temple University |url=http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220065328/http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm |archivedate=20 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enabling America: Assessing the Role of Rehabilitation Science and Engineering"&gt;{{cite web |title=Enabling America: Assessing the Role of Rehabilitation Science and Engineering |date=7 May 2017 |website=Enabling America: Assessing the Role of Rehabilitation Science and Engineering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MLlTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54&amp;lpg=PT54&amp;dq=rehabilitation+services+administration+predecessor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6swwttQ6cG&amp;sig=ST9xE69oBbRyYtBZKyu2PwHl5x4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi169iQk93TAhUP8WMKHaRxDf8Q6AEIRzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=rehabilitation%20services%20administration%20predecessor&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Public Law 89-333 &lt;ref name="Public Law 89-333"&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Law 89-333 |date=7 May 2017 |website=U.S. Government Printing Office |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-79/pdf/STATUTE-79-Pg1282.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; expanded federal funding to a 75-25 ratio. It also removed economic need as a requirement for services.

In 1972 the first versions of the Rehabilitation Act was passed by Congress, but vetoed by President [[Richard Nixon]], once in October 1972 &lt;ref name="376 - Memorandum of Disapproval of Nine Bills."&gt;{{cite web |title=376 - Memorandum of Disapproval of Nine Bills. |date=7 May 2017 |website=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in March 1973.&lt;ref name="91 - Veto of the Vocational Rehabilitation Bill."&gt;{{cite web |title=91 - Veto of the Vocational Rehabilitation Bill. |date=7 May 2017 |website=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=4154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Nixon eventually signed the bill, sponsored by Representative [[John Brademas]] into law on September 26, 1973. One of the key pieces in the law is [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act]] that says “no otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States shall solely on the basis of his handicap, be excluded from the participation, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” &lt;ref name="REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973"&gt;{{cite web |title=REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973 |date=7 May 2017 |website=The U.S. Department of Education |url=https://www2.ed.gov/policy/speced/leg/rehab/rehabilitation-act-of-1973-amended-by-wioa.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that any organization or program that receives federal funding cannot discriminate against disabled individuals. One of the main purposes of the Act is to provide a statutory basis for the Rehabilitation Services Administration, who helps to develop and maintain federal regulations for individuals with disabilities and their families to help them find jobs and live independently. The RSA is the main agency responsible for carrying out Titles I (Vocational Rehabilitation Services), III (Professional Development and Special Projects and Demonstrations ), VI (Employment Opportunities for Individuals with Disabilities) and VII (Independent Living Services and Centers for Independent Living), as well as specified portions of Title V (Rights and Advocacy) of the Rehabilitation Act.&lt;ref name="REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973"&gt;{{cite web |title=REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973 |date=7 May 2017 |website=The U.S. Department of Education |url=https://www2.ed.gov/policy/speced/leg/rehab/rehabilitation-act-of-1973-amended-by-wioa.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rehabilitation Act continued to evolve, in 1986, Public Law 99-506&lt;ref name="Public Law 99-506"&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Law 99-506 |date=7 May 2017 |website=U.S. Government Printing Office |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-100/pdf/STATUTE-100-Pg1807.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; helped to refine and focus services offered to those with the most severe disabilities. [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act]] of 1973 helped to influence additional legislation like the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. In 1998, the [[Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act]] (WIOA) impacted programs like the RSA, and according to RSA’s website, was intended to strengthen and improve the nation’s public workforce development system and help Americans with significant barriers to employment, including individuals with disabilities, into high quality jobs and careers and help employers hire and retain skilled workers. Title IV of WIOA amended title I of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]].&lt;ref name="Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act"&gt;{{cite web |title=Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act |date=7 May 2017 |website=The U.S. Department of Education |url=https://rsa.ed.gov/display.cfm?pageid=441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the WIOA, the Governor of each State or Territory must submit a Unified or Combined State Plan to the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] that outlines a four-year strategy for the State’s workforce development system. Each state’s four-year plan is available on the RSA’s website and requires many governmental agencies to work together to review and approve the states’ plans.&lt;ref name="Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act State Plans"&gt;{{cite web |title=Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act State Plans |date=7 May 2017 |website=The U.S. Department of Education |url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/rsa/wioa/state-plans/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|text=the tissue sensitivity weighting factor W&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; used in calculating the [[effective dose (radiation safety)]]}}
{{more citations needed|date=October 2013}}

In [[radiobiology]], the '''relative biological effectiveness''' (often abbreviated as '''RBE''') is the ratio of biological effectiveness of one type of [[ionizing radiation]] relative to another, given the same [[absorbed dose|amount of absorbed energy]]. The RBE is an empirical value that varies depending on the particles, energies involved, and which biological effects are deemed relevant.

==Application==
[[File:SI Radiation dose units.png|thumb|400px|ICRP Protection Dose quantities in SI units]]
In ionizing radiation [[dosimetry]] RBE is now represented in the recommendations of the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) by the [[radiation weighting factor]], (W&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) for each type of radiation; it was formerly the quality factor (Q).&lt;ref name="icrp92"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=Dr. W. K. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Relative biological effectiveness (RBE), quality factor (Q) and radiation weighting factor (Wr)|journal=Annals of the ICRP|date=January 2003|volume=33|series=ICRP Publication 92|issue=4|url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%2092|isbn=978-0-08-044311-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These weighting factors convert [[absorbed dose]] (measured in SI units of [[gray (unit)|gray]]s or non-SI [[rad (unit)|rad]]s) into formal biological [[equivalent dose]] for radiation exposure (measured in units of [[sievert]]s or [[rem (unit)|rem]]). The higher the RBE or weighting factor for a type of radiation, the more damaging it is, and this is incorporated into the calculation to convert from gray to sievert units (seeaccompanying diagram).

The relative biological effectiveness for radiation of type ''R'' on a tissue of type ''X'' is defined as the ratio
:&lt;math&gt;RBE= \frac{D_X}{D_R}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is a reference [[absorbed dose]] of radiation of a standard type ''X'', and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is the absorbed dose of radiation of type ''R'' that causes the same amount of biological damage. Both doses are quantified by the amount of [[energy]] absorbed in the cells.

Different types of radiation have different biological effectiveness mainly because they transfer their energy to the tissue in different ways.  Photons and beta particles have a low [[linear energy transfer]] coefficient, meaning that they ionize atoms in the tissue that are spaced by several hundred [[nanometer]]s (several tenths of a [[micrometre|micrometer]]) apart, along their path. In contrast, the much more massive alpha particles and neutrons leave a denser trail of ionized atoms in their wake, spaced about one tenth of a nanometer apart (i.e., less than one-thousandth of the typical distance between ionizations for photons and beta particles).

The concept of RBE is relevant in medicine, such as in [[radiology]] and [[radiotherapy]], and to the evaluation of risks and consequences of [[radioactive contamination]] in various contexts, such as [[nuclear power plant]] operation, [[nuclear fuel]] disposal and reprocessing, [[nuclear weapon]]s, [[uranium mining]], and ionizing [[ionizing radiation#Monitoring and controlling exposure|radiation safety]].

Radiation weighting factors that go from physical energy to biological effect must not be confused with [[tissue weighting factor]]s. The tissue weighting factors are used to convert an [[equivalent dose]] to a given tissue in the body, to an [[effective radiation dose]], a number that provides an estimation of total danger to the whole organism, as a result of the radiation dose to part of the body.

==Adoption of weighting factors==
[[File:Neutron radiation weighting factor as a function of kinetic energy.gif|thumb|350px|The radiation weighting factor for neutrons has been revised over time and remains controversial.]]
To bypass the complexity of tissue dependence, the ICRP defined standard radiation weighting factors, independently of tissue type, to be used for risk and exposure assessment in radiology and the nuclear industry.&lt;ref name="icrp103"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection|journal=Annals of the ICRP|year=2007|volume=37|series=ICRP publication 103|issue=2–4|url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103|accessdate=17 May 2012|isbn=978-0-7020-3048-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These values are conservatively chosen to be greater than the bulk of experimental values observed for the most sensitive cell types, with respect to external (external to the cell) sources.  Values for internal  sources for heavy ions, such as a recoil nucleus, have not been developed.  The ICRP 2007 standard values for relative effectiveness are given below.

Thus, for example, a given amount of energy absorbed in the form of 15&amp;nbsp;keV neutrons should be assumed to produce 10 times the damage caused by an equal amount of energy absorbed as X-rays or gamma rays.

==Experimental methods ==
[[File:Rbe definition.png|thumb|right|300px|LD-50 limit for CHO-K1 cell line irradiated by photons (blue curve) and by carbon ions (red curve).]]
Typically the evaluation of relative biological effectiveness is done on various types of living cells grown in [[culture medium]], including [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cells such as [[bacteria]], simple [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells such as single celled plants, and advanced eukaryotic cells derived from organisms such as [[rat]]s.  The doses are adjusted to the [[LD-50]] point; that is, to the amount that will cause 50% of the cells to become unable to undergo [[mitotic division]] (or, for bacteria, [[binary fission]]), thus being effectively sterilized — even if they can still carry out other cellular functions.

The types ''R'' of ionizing radiation most considered in RBE evaluation are [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma radiation]] (both consisting of [[photon]]s), [[alpha radiation]]s ([[helium-4]] nuclei), [[beta radiation]] ([[electron]]s and [[positron]]s), [[neutron radiation]], and heavy [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], including the fragments of [[nuclear fission]].  For some kinds of radiation, the RBE is strongly dependent on the energy of the individual particles.

===Dependence on tissue type===
Early on it was found that X-rays, gamma radiation, and beta radiation were essentially equivalent for all cell types.  Therefore, the standard radiation type ''X'' is generally an X-ray beam with 250&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|keV]] photons.  As a result, the relative biological effectiveness of beta and photon radiation is essentially 1.

For other radiation types, the RBE is not a well-defined physical quantity, since it varies somewhat with the type of tissue and with the precise place of absorption within the cell.  Thus, for example, the RBE for alpha radiation is 2–3 when measured on [[bacteria]], 4–6 for simple [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, and 6–8 for higher eukaryotic cells. According to one source it may be much higher (6500 with X rays as the reference) on ovocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nagasawa|first=H.|last2=Little|first2=J. B.|date=1992-11-15|title=Induction of sister chromatid exchanges by extremely low doses of alpha-particles|journal=Cancer Research|volume=52|issue=22|pages=6394–6396|issn=0008-5472|pmid=1423287}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RBE of neutrons is 4–6 for bacteria, 8–12 for simple eukaryotic cells, and 12–16 for higher eukaryotic cells.

===Dependence on source location===
In the early experiments, the sources of radiation were all external to the cells that were irradiated. However, since alpha particles cannot traverse the outermost dead layer of human skin, they can do significant damage only if they come from the decay of atoms inside the body.  Since the range of an alpha particle is typically about the diameter of a single eukaryotic cell, the precise location of the emitting atom in the tissue cells becomes significant.

For this reason, it has been suggested that the health impact of contamination by alpha emitters might have been substantially underestimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winters TH, Di Franza JR | title = Radioactivity in cigarette smoking | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 306 | issue = 6 | pages = 364–5 | date = February 1982 | pmid = 7054712 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198202113060613 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Measurements of RBE with external sources also neglect the ionization caused by the [[recoil]] of the parent-nucleus due to the alpha decay. While the recoil of the parent-nucleus of the decaying atom typically carries only about 2% of the energy of the alpha-particle that is emitted by the decaying atom, its range is extremely short (about 2–3 angstroms), due to its high [[electric charge]] and high [[mass]].  The parent nucleus is required to recoil, upon emission of an [[alpha particle]], with a discrete kinetic energy due to [[conservation of momentum]]. Thus, all of the ionization energy from the recoil-nucleus is deposited in an extremely small volume near its original location, typically in the cell nucleus on the chromosomes, which have an affinity for heavy metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu G, Zhang CY | title = Functional nucleic acid-based sensors for heavy metal ion assays | journal = The Analyst | volume = 139 | issue = 24 | pages = 6326–42 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25356810 | doi = 10.1039/C4AN01069H | bibcode = 2014Ana...139.6326Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Chapter 8: Metal/Nucleic-Acid Interactions | first = Jacqueline K. | last = Barton | name-list-format = vanc | editor-last1 = Bertini | editor-first1 = Ivano | editor-last2 = Gray | editor-first2 = Harry B. | editor-last3 = Lippard | editor-first3  =Stephen J. | editor-last4 = Valentine | editor-first4 = Joan Selverstone | title = Bioinorganic Chemistry | date = 1994 | publisher = Univ.

==History==
In 1931, Failla and Henshaw reported on determination of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of x rays and γ rays. This appears to be the first use of the term ‘RBE’. The authors noted that RBE was dependent on the experimental system being studied. Somewhat later, it was pointed out by Zirkle et al. (1952) that the biological effectiveness depends on the spatial distribution of the energy imparted and the density of ionisations per unit path length of the ionising particles. Zirkle et al. coined the term ‘linear energy transfer (LET)’ to be used in radiobiology for the stopping power, i.e. the energy loss per unit path length of a charged particle. The concept was introduced in the 1950s, at a time when the deployment of nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors spurred research on the biological effects of artificial radioactivity.  It had been noticed that those effects depended both on the type and [[energy spectrum]] of the radiation, and on the kind of living tissue.  The first systematic experiments to determine the RBE were conducted in that decade.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The '''Sahrawi Red Crescent Society''' is the part of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] for the country of [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] in Northern Africa.

==Foundation==
The Sahrawi Red Crescent was formed by [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] citizens on November 26, 1975, days after the joint Moroccan-Mauritanian invasion of former [[Spanish Sahara]] territory.&lt;ref name="TriangleGH-SRC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview of the President of the Saharawi Red Crescent, Mr. Bouhabini Yahia|url=http://www.trianglegh.org/English/html/Information/Newsletter-avril-2009-gb/Art-3.html|publisher=Triangle Generation Humanitaire|accessdate=2012-10-30}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
During the first years of the organization, its major task was to reunite families who were scattered through the desert due to the [[Western Sahara War]] removing them from the battlefields to the neighbouring Algerian Sahara, facing the aerial bombardments of the [[Moroccan Air Force]]. Later came the organization of the [[Sahrawi refugee camps|refugee camps]] at the Algerian desert.&lt;ref name="TriangleGH-SRC" /&gt;

The '''Punaura Dham, janki mandir''' is a Hindu pilgrimage site in [[Sitamarhi district]], in the [[India]]n state of [[Bihar]], which has an ancient [[Hindu]] temple. It is situated 5&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Sitamarhi]] town and a popular visitor's attraction.

'''Punaura Dham  Janki Mandir ''' is one of the holiest Hindu temples dedicated to Goddess  [[Sita]], located in [[Sitamarhi]], [[Bihar]], [[India]]. Million of pilgrims visit the temple every year and most visited religious shrine in [[North India]]. I

'''Punaura Dham''' is about 5&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Sitamarhi]]. Saint Pundrik's Ashram was situated here. '''Sita-Kund''' place is the honour of being the birthplace of Hindu Goddess, [[Sita]].

==Reaching there==
The place can be easily reached from the [[Patna]] Airport, Bus Station, Patna Railway Station. The temple is just approx. 150&amp;nbsp;km from the Patna Junction Railway Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Traveling to Sita Kund|url=http://www.india9.com/i9show/Sita-Kund-Temple-55481.htm|accessdate=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bus, taxis etc. are available at Patna, Gulzarbagh, Patliputra and Patna City railway stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sita-Kund History|url=http://bihardarpan.blogspot.com/2017/10/Sita-Kund.html|accessdate=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The place can be easily reached from the adjacent District's [[Muzaffarpur]], [[Darbhanga]], [[Madhubani district|Madhubani]] and [[East Champaran]].

The temple is just approx. 70 –80&amp;nbsp;km from  the [[Muzaffarpur]] Railway Station/ Bus Station, [[Darbhanga]] Junction Railway Station/ Bus Station [[Madhubani, India|Madhubani]] Railway Station/ Bus Station and [[Motihari]] Railway Station/ Bus Station.

==Sitamarhi==
This is the place where [[Sita]] was born, the main character of the epic Ramayana. The town is situated along the border of Nepal.

This district is often bereaved by natural calamities. One of the most devastating is excess flooding due to mis-management of the banks by both civilians and government officials. This town was almost completely destroyed by the earthquake of 1934.

[[Sitamarhi]] is a beautiful place. Sitamarhi is far away from Patna (approximately 140&amp;nbsp;km), lies the historical and mythologically-essayed town of Sitamarhi.

The '''Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists''' ('''SCP''') is the [[professional association]] and [[trade union]] for registered chiropodists and podiatrists in the [[United Kingdom]]. The charitable subsidiary of the organisation is the '''College of Podiatry''' which was formed in 2012.&lt;ref name="College of Podiatry History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scpod.org/society/ | title=Society | publisher=Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists | accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The union originated in 1912 as the '''Society of Chiropodists''', the first organisation of [[chiropodist]]s in Europe.&lt;ref name="A guide to archive resources in the United Kingdom"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Janet Foster |author2=Julia Sheppard |title=British archives: a guide to archive resources in the United Kingdom | page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1916, it was renamed the '''Incorporated Society of Chiropodists''', and in 1919, it established examinations for potential new members.&lt;ref name="Society history"&gt;{{cite book | author=Gerald Larkin | title=Occupational monopoly and modern medicine | page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several rival organisations emerged: the Northern Association of Chiropodists, the Chelsea Chiropodists Association and the British Association of Chiropodists.  These merged with the Incorporated Society in 1945, the new body once more taking the name Society of Chiropodists.&lt;ref name="A guide to archive resources in the United Kingdom" /&gt; It was recognised as a negotiating body by the [[National Health Service]] in 1948, but did not register as a trade union until 1978.

[[File:Spéculum en plastique.jpg|thumb|250px|The disposable bivalved plastic vaginal speculum is used in office gynecology]]

A '''speculum''' (Latin for "mirror"; plural '''specula''' or speculums) is a medical tool for investigating body [[orifices]], with a form dependent on the orifice for which it is designed.  In old texts, the speculum may also be referred to as a '''diopter''' or '''dioptra'''.&lt;ref&gt;"diopter" in ''The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Like an [[endoscope]], a speculum allows a view inside the body; endoscopes, however, tend to have [[optics]] while a speculum is intended for direct vision.

==History==
[[File:5 Speculum, 14th 15th and 16th century. Wellcome M0008374.jpg|thumb|right|14th, 15th and 16th century specula]]
Vaginal and anal specula were used by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/roman_surgical/ |author=Univ. of Virginia |title=Surgical Instruments from Ancient Rome  (with pictures) |accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and speculum [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] have been found in [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = History of Medicine|author = [[Cecilia Mettler]]|publisher = The Blakiston Co (1947)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vaginal speculum, developed by [[J. Marion Sims]], consists of a hollow cylinder with a rounded end that is divided into two hinged parts, somewhat like the [[beak]] of a duck. The speculum is inserted into the vagina to dilate it for examination of the [[vagina]] and [[cervix]].

==Construction==
Specula were formerly made of [[stainless steel]], and sterilized after use. However, many, especially those used in emergency departments and doctor's offices, are now made of plastic, and are disposable, single-use items.  Those used in surgical suites are still commonly made of metal.

==Types==
[[File:Glasspekula.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Two cylindrical-shaped glass specula]]

Specula come in a variety of shapes based on their purpose, and a variety of sizes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-e-dical.com/english/vs.htm|title=Comparison chart of speculum types, with line images|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in any case the cylinder or blade(s) of the instrument allow the operator a direct vision of the area of interest and the possibility to introduce instruments for further interventions such as a biopsy.

===Vaginal use===

The best-known speculum is the bivalved vaginal speculum; the two blades are hinged and are "closed" when the speculum is inserted to facilitate its entry and "opened" in its final position where they can be arrested by a screw mechanism, so that the operator is freed from keeping the blades apart.

A cylindrical-shaped speculum, introduced in 2001, the dilating vaginal speculum (also known as the Veda-scope&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15089838|year=2004|author1=Longmore|first1=P. G.|title=Veda-scope: More comfortable than the bivalve speculum and cytologically equivalent|journal=The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|volume=44|issue=2|pages=140–5|doi=10.1111/j.1479-828X.2004.00180.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;) invented by Clemens van der Weegen,&lt;ref&gt;van der Weegen, Clemens (2000) "Vaginal speculum with seal" {{US Patent|6719687}}&lt;/ref&gt; inflates the vagina with filtered air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11787909|year=2001|author1=Thomas|first1=A|title=A randomised controlled trial comparing a dilating vaginal speculum with a conventional bivalve speculum|journal=The Australian &amp; New Zealand journal of obstetrics &amp; gynaecology|volume=41|issue=4|pages=379–86|last2=Weisberg|first2=E|last3=Lieberman|first3=D|last4=Fraser|first4=I. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see diagram) The device has two main functions: a) to take a normal Pap smear with a cervical brush or a cytology brush; and b) as an internal [[colposcope]] so that the operator can pivot the Veda-scope to view any part of the vagina barrel and cervix facilitated by an internal light source that can illuminate the vaginal wall and cervix with multi-coloured light filters, which can detect pre-cancerous cells with the aid of [[acetic acid]] solution and [[iodine]] solution. It also has a facility to attach a digital camera for viewing and recording.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacificei.com/how_work.html How it works]. pacificei.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Dilating vaginal speculum inflating vagina and light illuminating.jpg|right|thumb|Dilating vaginal speculum inflating vagina and light illuminating (cervical brush inserts through top inlet)]]

A specialized  form of vaginal speculum is the weighted speculum, which consists of a broad half tube which is bent at about a 90 degree angle, with the channel of the tube on the exterior side of the angle.  One end of the tube has a roughly spherical metal weight surrounding the channel of the speculum.  A weighted speculum is placed in the vagina during vaginal [[surgery]] with the patient in the [[lithotomy position]].  The weight holds the speculum in place and frees the surgeon's hands for other tasks.
A vaginal speculum is also used in fertility treatments, particularly artificial insemination, and allows the vaginal cavity to be opened and observed thereby facilitating the deposit of semen into the vagina.

===Rectal use===
Vaginal specula are also used for [[anus|anal]] surgery, although several other forms of anal specula exist.  One form, the [[Anoscopy|anoscope]], resembles a tube that has a removable [[bullet]]-shaped insert.  When the anoscope is inserted into the anus, the insert dilates the anus to the diameter of the tube.  The insert is then removed, leaving the tube to allow examination of the lower rectum and anus.

This style of anal speculum is one of the oldest designs for surgical instruments still in use, with examples dating back many centuries. The [[Sigmoidoscopy|sigmoidoscope]] can be further advanced into the lower intestinal tract and requires an endoscopic set-up.

===Oral use===
In veterinary medicine, a McPherson Speculum can be used for oral examination. The speculum helps keep the mouth open during the exam and helps avoid biting injuries.

==BDSM==
Speculum is used for ''Speculum Play'' under [[BDSM]] for spreading the [[vagina]] or the [[anus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kinkly.com/definition/14516/speculum-play Speculum Play by www.kinkly.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was constructed between 2005 and 2010, specifically as a multi-purpose project, but with a major part of construction involving the hydropower plant, 11.8 km headrace tunnel from Lake Tana, and 7.2km tailrace tunnel to the Jehana river (minor tributary of the Beles River) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beles Multipurpose Project - Salini Impregilo |url=https://www.salini-impregilo.com/en/projects/completed/dams-hydroelectric-plants/beles-multipurpose-project.html |website=www.salini-impregilo.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

While Lake Tana and the Beles River are both in the [[Blue Nile]]/Abbay basin, water would not usually flow from the lake through this river.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3738">The '''tobacco industry of Argentina''' produced 157,294 tonnes of [[tobacco]] in the 2003&amp;ndash;2004 harvest, most of which (93,327 tonnes) was exported. The planted area was 831.75&amp;nbsp;km², of which 776 were harvested.

The tobacco industry is dominated by two transnational companies: Massalin Particulares S.A. (a subsidiary of [[Philip Morris International]], which sells the [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] brand, and which in turn is associated with Tabacos Norte S.A.) and Nobleza Piccardo (a subsidiary of [[British American Tobacco]], which sells international brands such as [[Lucky Strike]], [[Viceroy (cigarette)|Viceroy]] and [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]], as well as national ones like Jockey and Derby).

Tobacco producers are concentrated in the north of the country. The provinces of [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]] and [[Salta Province|Salta]] (in the [[Argentine Northwest|north-west]]), and [[Misiones Province|Misiones]] (in the north-eastern [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Mesopotamia]]), are the leading ones, with over 45,000 tonnes/year each. The other tobacco-producing provinces are [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]], [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], [[Chaco Province|Chaco]] and [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]].

Tobacco plays an important role in the economy of the producing areas, which are comparatively poor provinces. The Argentine tobacco industry employs 500,000 people, about half of them directly involved in the planting and harvesting, only about 2% in the manufacturing of the derived products, and the rest in distribution and sales. Therefore, despite the fact that the consequences of smoking are a major health issue in [[Argentina]], the national government supports the producers by means of a Tobacco Special Fund (''Fondo Especial del Tabaco'', FET), which consists in a [[subsidy]] plus easier access to [[credit (finance)|credit]] in order to modernize the industry.

== Labor Practices ==
An important number of Argentina's tobacco industry employees are mostly underage workers. The TVPRA ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/ List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]&lt;/ref&gt; published in December 2014 by the [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]] underlines the existence of such practices in Argentina. The [[United States Department of Labor]] reported that despite the implementation of educational programs, "children in Argentina continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and the worst forms of child labor..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/argentina.htm 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Argentina - ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
Effective from 8 August 2016, under the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) rules, a vape shop that mixes or prepares e-liquids, or makes or modifies any kind of e-cigarettes, is regulated as a tobacco product manufacturer.&lt;ref name=FDA-2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaporizers, E-Cigarettes, and other Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS)|url=http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/ProductsIngredientsComponents/ucm456610.htm|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|agency=US Food and Drug Administration|date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vape shops cannot hand out free samples to patrons or sell to individuals under 18 years of age.&lt;ref name=Madhani2016/&gt; Retailers are required to ask for photo ID from patrons who look to be under 27 years of age.&lt;ref name=Madhani2016&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/08/07/e-cigarette-regulations-set-go-into-effect/88362926/|title=It's about to get a lot harder for minors to vape|author=Aamer Madhani|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016 the FDA used its authority under the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]] to deem e-cigarette devices and e-liquids to be tobacco products, which meant it intended to regulate the marketing, labelling, and manufacture of devices and liquids; vape shops that mix e-liquids or make or modify devices were considered manufacturing sites that needed to register with FDA and comply with [[good manufacturing practice]] regulation.&lt;ref name=FDA2016&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/05/10/2016-10685/deeming-tobacco-products-to-be-subject-to-the-federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-as-amended-by-the|journal=Federal Register|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|page=234|date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small vape shop businesses are concerned about the FDA regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10130211234592774869404581088451777513530|title=FDA Cloud Hangs Over Vape Shops|author=Tripp Mickle|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vape shop owners in the US are concerned about the costs of adhering to the proposed FDA regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsinferno.com/new-regulations-for-liquid-nicotine-expected-to-have-major-impact-on-vape-shops/|title=New Regulations for Liquid Nicotine Expected to Have Major Impact on Vape Shops|author=F.A.

The '''Water and Power Development Authority''' (WAPDA) ('''واٹر اینڈ پاور ڈیولپمنٹ اتھارٹی''') is a [[Government of Pakistan|government]]-owned [[public utility]] maintaining [[Electrical power industry|power]] and [[Water industry|water]] in [[Pakistan]], although it does not manage [[Thermal power station|thermal power]]. WAPDA includes [[Tarbela Dam|Tarbela]] and [[Mangla Dam|Mangla]] dams among its resources. Its headquarters are in [[Lahore]].

==History==
WAPDA was established by an act of parliament in 1958&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wapda.gov.pk/ Water and Power Development Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; to unify the maintenance of [[infrastructure]] previously overseen by [[Subdivisions of Pakistan|provincial]] agencies.  Its Chairmen included outstanding civil servants like [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]], [[Ghulam Faruque Khan]] and [[Aftab Ghulam Nabi Kazi]] who were subsequently [[President of Pakistan]], Minister for Commerce and Economic Adviser, respectively. In October 2007, thermal power management was split into the newly formed [[Pakistan Electric Power Company]] (PEPCO).

==WAPDA Water vision 2025==
{{main|WAPDA Water vision 2025}}
WAPDA has formulated a comprehensive $25–33 billion National Water Resource and Hydropower Development Programme, entitled Water Vision 2025. The Water Vision 2025 projects are expected to generate 16,000 MW of hydroelectricity.  Other goals are to prevent water shortages, limit drought and increase water storage for a growing population. Five massive hydropower projects have been announced by the President of Pakistan; these are to be completed by 2016, with a generation capacity of 9,500 MW. Two of the projects are ready for construction, while three are in the stages of feasibility studies and preparation of tender documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Business/24-Sep-2008/Wapda-Vision-2025-to-help-solve-power-crisis Wapda Vision 2025]&lt;/ref&gt;

Water Vision 2025 consists of three phases.  Phase I was expected to start in 1993 but was delayed.  The priority of water sector projects under Phase I of Water Vision 2025 are [[Gomal Dam]] (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) , [[Mirani Dam]] and [[Mithan Kot Barrage]] at [[Kachhi Canal Project|Kachhi Canal]] (Balochistan) raising of [[Mangla Dam]] (Azad Kashmir), Greater Thal Canal phase I (Punjab) and Thar/ [[Rainee Canal Project|Rainee]] Canals phase I (Sindh).   The total cost of these Phase I projects will be $2.467 billion with a construction period of five years.  Under Phase II, [[Hingol Dam]], [[Balochistan Dam]] and [[Satpara Dam]] (Northern Areas), Chashma Right Bank Canal and [[Khurram Tangi Dam]] (NWFP), phase II of the Greater Thal Canal [[Akhori Dam]] and [[Sanjwal Dam]] (Punjab), phase II of Thar/Rainee Canals, Gajnai and Sehwan Barrage (Sindh) will be completed in 3–6 years, except [[Basha Dam]], which will take 8–10 years for its completion. The total cost of Phase II projects will be $8.94 billion. These 11 projects will have a storage capacity of {{convert|12790000|acre.ft|km3}}, would generate over 3362&amp;nbsp;mW of power, and would irrigate 14000 square kilometres of land. Under Phase III, [[Yugo Dam]], [[Skardu Dam]], [[Dhok Dam]], [[Rohtas Dam]], [[Naulang Dam]] and [[Khadji Dam]] will be completed.&lt;ref&gt;
