[[File:Agonist full and partial.svg|thumb|320px|Agonists activating hypothetical receptors.]]
[[Image:Efficacy spectrum.png|right|thumb|320px|Efficacy spectrum of receptor ligands.]]

An '''agonist''' is a chemical that binds to a [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] and activates the receptor to produce a biological response. Whereas an agonist causes an action, an [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] blocks the action of the agonist, and an [[inverse agonist]] causes an action opposite to that of the agonist.

== {{anchor|Full agonist|Types}}Types of agonists == &lt;!--"Selective agonist" and "Full agonist" redirect here via "Types" and "Full agonist" respectively.--&gt;

[[Receptor (biochemistry)|Receptors]] can be activated by either [[endogenous]] agonists (such as [[hormone]]s and [[neurotransmitter]]s) or [[exogenous]] agonists (such as [[medication|drugs]]), resulting in a biological response. A [[physiological agonism and antagonism|physiological agonist]] is a substance that creates the same bodily responses but does not bind to the same receptor.

* An [[endogenous agonist]] for a particular receptor is a compound naturally produced by the body that binds to and activates that receptor. For example, the endogenous agonist for [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptors]] is [[serotonin]], and the endogenous agonist for [[dopamine receptor]]s is [[dopamine]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman and Gilman's Manual of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. (11th edition, 2008). p14. {{ISBN|0-07-144343-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Full agonists''' bind to and activate a receptor with the maximum response that an agonist can elicit at the receptor. One example of a drug that can act as a full agonist is [[isoproterenol]], which mimics the action of [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] at [[Adrenergic receptor|β adrenoreceptors]]. Another example is [[morphine]], which mimics the actions of [[endorphin]]s at [[μ-opioid receptor]]s throughout the [[central nervous system]]. However, a drug can act as a full agonist in some tissues and as a partial agonist in other tissues, depending upon the relative numbers of receptors and differences in receptor coupling.{{mcn|date=December 2017}}
* A '''co-agonist''' works with other co-agonists to produce the desired effect together. [[NMDA receptor]] activation requires the binding of both [[glutamate]], [[glycine]] and D-serine co-agonists.
* A '''selective agonist''' is selective for a specific type of receptor. E.g. [[buspirone]] is a selective agonist for serotonin 5-HT1A.
* [[Partial agonist]]s (such as [[buspirone]], [[aripiprazole]], [[buprenorphine]], or [[clozapine|norclozapine]]) also bind and activate a given receptor, but have only partial [[Intrinsic activity|efficacy]] at the receptor relative to a full agonist, even at maximal receptor occupancy. Agents like [[buprenorphine]] are used to treat [[opiate]] dependence for this reason, as they produce milder effects on the opioid receptor with lower dependence and abuse potential.
* An [[inverse agonist]] is an agent that binds to the same receptor binding-site as an agonist for that receptor and inhibits the constitutive activity of the receptor. [[Inverse agonist]]s exert the opposite pharmacological effect of a receptor agonist, not merely an absence of the agonist effect as seen with antagonist. An example is the cannabinoid inverse agonist [[rimonabant]].
* A [[superagonist]] is a term used by some to identify a compound that is capable of producing a greater response than the [[endogenous agonist]] for the target receptor. It might be argued that the endogenous agonist is simply a partial agonist in that tissue.
* An [[irreversible agonist]] is a type of agonist that binds permanently to a receptor through the formation of covalent bonds. A few of these have been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = ((De Mey JGR)), Compeer MG, Meens MJ |title= Endothelin-1, an Endogenous Irreversible Agonist in Search of an Allosteric Inhibitor |journal= Mol Cell Pharmacol |volume= 1 |issue= 5 |pages= 246–257 |date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Rosenbaum DM, Zhang C, Lyons JA, Holl R, Aragao D, Arlow DH, Rasmussen SG, Choi HJ, Devree BT, Sunahara RK, Chae PS, Gellman SH, Dror RO, Shaw DE, Weis WI, Caffrey M, Gmeiner P, Kobilka BK |title= Structure and function of an irreversible agonist-β(2) adrenoceptor complex |journal= Nature |volume= 469 |issue= 7329 |pages= 236–40 |date= January 2013 |pmid= 21228876 |doi= 10.1038/nature09665 |pmc=3074335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New findings that broaden the conventional definition of pharmacology demonstrate that [[ligand]]s can concurrently behave as agonist ''and'' antagonists at the same receptor, depending on effector pathways or tissue type.

== Activity ==

=== Potency ===
Potency is the amount of agonist needed to elicit a desired response. The [[Potency (pharmacology)|potency]] of an agonist is inversely related to its [[Half maximal effective concentration|EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] value. The EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; can be measured for a given agonist by determining the concentration of agonist needed to elicit half of the maximum biological response of the agonist. The EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar [[efficacy#Pharmacology|efficacies]] producing physiologically similar effects.  The smaller the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value, the greater the potency of the agonist, the lower the concentration of drug that is required to elicit the maximum biological response.

=== Therapeutic index ===
When a drug is used therapeutically, it is important to understand the margin of safety that exists between the dose needed for the desired effect and the dose that produces unwanted and possibly dangerous side-effects (measured by the TD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the dose that produces toxicity in 50% of individuals). This relationship, termed the [[therapeutic index]], is defined as the ratio [[median toxic dose|TD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]]:[[Effective dose (pharmacology)|ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]]. In general, the narrower this margin, the more likely it is that the drug will produce unwanted effects. The therapeutic index emphasizes the importance of the margin of safety, as distinct from the potency, in determining the usefulness of a drug.

== Etymology ==
From the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] '''αγωνιστής''' (agōnistēs), contestant; champion; rival &lt; '''αγων''' (agōn), contest, combat; exertion, struggle &lt; '''αγω''' (agō), I lead, lead towards, conduct; drive

{{Distinguish|text = [[Autonomism]], a [[left-wing]] political philosophy (also known as Autonomist Marxism)}}
'''Autonomism''' is a political doctrine which supports acquiring or preserving political autonomy of a nation or a region. It is not necessarily opposed to [[federalism]], and [[souverainism]] necessarily implies autonomism, but not vice versa.

Examples of autonomist parties include [[Action démocratique du Québec]] and its successor [[Coalition Avenir Québec]] in [[Canada]] ([[Quebec]]), [[New Macau Association]] in [[China]] ([[Macau]]), [[Martinican Progressive Party|Parti progressiste martiniquais]] ([[Martinique]]) in [[France]], [[Scottish National Party]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Lega Nord]] in [[Italy]] ([[Northern Italy]]) and [[Popular Democratic Party (Puerto Rico)|Popular Democratic Party]] in the [[United States]] ([[Puerto Rico]]).

== Canada ==
{{main|Autonomism in Quebec}}

Autonomism is a policy defended by four Quebec political parties, the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] (UN), the [[Action démocratique du Québec]] (ADQ), its successor [[Coalition Avenir Québec]] (CAQ) and the [[Équipe Autonomiste]] (EA), are provincial parties which aims to obtain certain federal capacities and to give the title of autonomous State to the province of Quebec.

== Spain ==
The [[Autonomous Communities of Spain]] may demonstrate the doctrine although it is limited in its extent.

== Switzerland ==
The 26 [[Cantons of Switzerland]] demonstrate autonomism in a federal state. The Swiss Federal Constitution declares the cantons to be sovereign to the extent their sovereignty is not limited by federal law. The cantons also retain all powers and competencies not delegated to the Confederation by the Constitution.

{{Culture of Karnataka}}

'''Bangalore Kannada''' is a vernacular dialect of the Indian language, [[Kannada]], which serves as the official language of the state of Karnataka, as the native language of approximately 65% of its population and as one of the [[classical languages of India]].

This dialect is primarily spoken by youth and in informal discourse between locals. This slang is quickly picked up by the outsiders who live in Bangalore.

Bangalore Kannada is spoken by the native people almost everywhere: at home, in educational institutions and other places. Bangalore and Mysore Kannada are the most commonly used in other mediums such as plays and movies.

Localities/areas in which Kannada is dominant include [[Basavanagudi]], [[Basaveshwaranagar]], [[Chamrajpet]], [[Malleshwaram]], [[Rajajinagar]], [[Banashankari]], [[Sadashivanagar]], [[Vijayanagar, Bangalore|Vijayanagar]], [[Jayanagar, Bangalore|Jayanagar]], [[J P Nagar]], Shivaji Nagar, K.R market, Madhavnagar, Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Hebbala,Hosakerehalli, Kalasipalya, Konankunte, Padmanabhnagar, Hanumanthnagar, V.V.Puram, Kumarswamy layout, Kathriguppe, Kengeri, Bidadi, Chandra layout, Kamakshipalya, Kamalanagar, Mahalaxmi layout, Nandini layout, Yeshwanthpur, Peenya Industrial Area, Jalahalli, Yelahanka, Dollars colony, RMV extension, Jnanabharti campus &amp; surroundings, Hesaraghatta, Nagarbhavi, Vidyaranyapura etc. In other newer areas, one may hear other languages along with Kannada.

Through the years various radio stations have been popularising the language amongst youth and the large IT workforce of this city.

Some commonly used phrases, slangs or words specific to Bangalore Kannada are:
* ''bombaat'', ''sakkath'' - meaning awesome/cool
* ''bejaan''  - a lot
* ''kudumi'' - bookworm
* Chamak, dose - To scare someone in a funny way
* Sisya - your trusted buddy
* Chindi - amazing
* Takat thogo - eat food
* Boni - first sale of the day
* kedi - cunning guy
* tight aagbittidaane - highly drunken man
* meter - a measure of someone's braveness
* Thukaali - waste fellow
* Kirik aagthide - A fight happening between 2 people or groups

These words can be slang or catchy words, and can also be combined into [[Kanglish]] [Kannada+English].

For instance, "just maja maadi", meaning, "chill out", is a phrase popularized by one of the city's radio stations "Enjoy maadi" and "swalpa adjust maadi" are other such popular Kanglish phrases. ("Maadi" literally means "do" or "make".)

'''Biblical Hebrew orthography''' refers to the various systems which have been used to write the [[Biblical Hebrew language]]. Biblical Hebrew has been written in a number of different writing systems over time, and in those systems its spelling and punctuation have also undergone changes.

== Proto-Canaanite script ==

The earliest Hebrew writing discovered so far, dating back to the 10th century BCE, was found at [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]] in July 2008 by Israeli archaeologist [[Yosef Garfinkel|Yossi Garfinkel]].&lt;ref name="eurekalert.org"&gt;http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-01/uoh-mah010710.php University of Haifa press release, 7 Jan. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newmedia-eng.haifa.ac.il/?p=2043 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005020653/http://newmedia-eng.haifa.ac.il/?p=2043 |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 30 October 2008, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7700037.stm 'Oldest Hebrew script' is found], Retrieved 3 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mail Online, 31 October 2008, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1081850/Proof-David-slew-Goliath-Israeli-archaeologists-unearth-oldest-Hebrew-text.html Daily Mail], Retrieved 3 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The 15&amp;nbsp;cm x 16.5&amp;nbsp;cm (5.9&amp;nbsp;in x 6.5&amp;nbsp;in) trapezoid pottery [[sherd]] ([[ostracon]]) has five lines of text written in ink written in the [[Proto-Canaanite alphabet]] (the old form of the Phoenician alphabet).&lt;ref name="eurekalert.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bar"&gt;Oldest Hebrew inscription' Discovered in Israelite Fort on Philistine border, Biblical Archaeology Review, March/April 2010, pp. 51–6.&lt;/ref&gt; That the language of the tablet is Hebrew is suggested by the presence of the words תעש "to do" עבד "servant".&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;used in the tablet as a verb, unlike in Phoenician where this root is only nominal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurekalert.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gath.wordpress.com/2009/10/15/qeiyafah-inscription-update/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oldest Hebrew inscription' Discovered in Israelite Fort on Philistine border, Biblical Archaeology Review, March/April 2010, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The tablet is written from left to right, indicating that Hebrew writing was still in the formative stage.&lt;ref name="bar" /&gt;

== Phoenician and Paleo-Hebrew script ==

The Israelite tribes who settled in the land of Israel adopted the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician script]] around the 12th century&amp;nbsp;BCE, as found in the [[Gezer calendar]] (circa 10th century&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yardeni|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kchanson.com/ANCDOCS/westsem/gezer.html The Gezer Calendar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608000000/http://www.kchanson.com/ANCDOCS/westsem/gezer.html |date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This script developed into the Paleo-Hebrew script in the tenth or ninth centuries&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="y"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yardeni|1997|pp=13,15,17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tscript" /&gt;&lt;ref name="s17" /&gt; The [[Paleo-Hebrew]] alphabet's main differences from the Phoenician script  were "a curving to the left of the dowstrokes in the 'long-legged' letter-signs... the consistent use of a Waw with a concave top, [and an] x-shaped Taw."&lt;ref name="y" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;At times the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, and Philistines would also use the Paleo-Hebrew script, see {{Harvcoltxt|Yardeni|1997|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest inscriptions in Paleo-Hebrew script are dated to around the middle of the 9th century&amp;nbsp;BCE, the most famous being the [[Mesha Stele]] in the [[Moabite language]] (which might be considered a dialect of Hebrew).&lt;ref name="yheb"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yardeni|1997|pp=17–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmoab"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Hebrew script was in continuous use until the early 6th century&amp;nbsp;BCE, the end of the First Temple period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yardeni|1997|pp=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Second Temple Period the Paleo-Hebrew script gradually fell into disuse.&lt;ref name="yb" /&gt; The epigraphic material in the ancient Hebrew script is poor in the Second Temple Period.&lt;ref name="yheb" /&gt; Pentateuch fragments in the ancient Hebrew script dating to the 3rd or 2nd century&amp;nbsp;BCE were found in Qumran, Hasmonaean coins and coins from the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-135&amp;nbsp;BCE), and ostraca from [[Masada]] before its fall in 74&amp;nbsp;CE are among the youngest finds in the ancient script, as well as the use of divine names in texts otherwise in other scripts.&lt;ref name="yheb" /&gt; It seems that the Paleo-Hebrew script was completely abandoned among the Jews after the failed [[Bar Kochba revolt]].&lt;ref name="tscript" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yb"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yardeni|1997|pp=18,24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Samaritans retained the ancient Hebrew alphabet, which evolved into the modern [[Samaritan alphabet]].&lt;ref name="tscript"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|pp=218–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yb" /&gt; In fact, the adoption of the script by the Samaritans may have influenced the Rabbis' negative view of the script and lead to its final rejection.&lt;ref name="tscript" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yc"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yardeni|1997|pp=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;As an example of the Rabbis' view of the script, see [[tractate Sanhedrin|Sanhedrin]] 21b "The Torah was originally given to Israel in this [Assyrian] script. When they sinned, it became רועץ."&lt;/ref&gt;

The only papyrus document from the First Temple period that has survived was found in the [[Wadi Murabba'at]], and is dated to the 7th century&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="yheb" /&gt; However, fiber impressions on the back of many [[Bulla (seal)|bullae]] of that period show that papyrus was in common use in that region.&lt;ref name="yheb" /&gt; Presumably papyrus was common in the pre-exilic period, while in the Babylonian exile hide scrolls were used, given that papyrus does not grow there.&lt;ref name="yc" /&gt;

== Aramaic script ==

By the end of the First Temple period the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic script]], a separate descendant of the Phoenician script, became widespread throughout the region, gradually displacing Paleo-Hebrew.&lt;ref name="yb" /&gt; The Jews who were exiled to Babylon became familiar with Aramaic out of necessity, while the Jews remaining in Judea seem to have mostly lost the writing tradition.&lt;ref name="yc" /&gt; According to tradition, the Aramaic script became established with the return of [[Ezra]] from exile around the 4th century&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="tscript" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yc" /&gt; The oldest documents that have been found in the Aramaic Script are fragments of the scrolls of Exodus, Samuel, and Jeremiah found among the Dead Sea scrolls, dating from the late 3rd and early 2nd centuries&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="ysq"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yardeni|1997|pp=42,45,47–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Hebrew alphabet]], also known as the Assyrian or Square script, is a descendant of the Aramaic alphabet.&lt;ref name="yb" /&gt; It seems that the earlier Biblical books were originally written in the Paleo-Hebrew script, while the later books were written directly in the later Assyrian script.&lt;ref name="tscript" /&gt; Some Qumran texts written in the Assyrian script write the [[tetragrammaton]] and some other divine names in Paleo-Hebrew, and this practice is also found in several Jewish-Greek Biblical translations.&lt;ref name="tscript" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Though some of these translations wrote the tetragrammaton in the square script, see {{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While spoken Hebrew continued to evolve into [[Mishnaic Hebrew]], the scribal tradition for writing the Torah gradually developed.&lt;ref name="ybook"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yardeni|1997|pp=65,84–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of regional "book-hand" styles developed for the purpose of Torah manuscripts and occasionally other literary works, distinct from the calligraphic styles used mainly for private purposes.&lt;ref name="ybook" /&gt; The [[Sephardi]] and [[Ashkenazi]] book-hand styles were later adapted to printed fonts after the invention of the printing press.&lt;ref name="ybook" /&gt;

== Polyphonic letters ==

The Phoenician script had dropped five characters by the twelfth century&amp;nbsp;BCE, reflecting the language's twenty-two consonantal phonemes.&lt;ref name="s17"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sáenz-Badillos|1993|pp=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the 22 letters of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet numbered less than the consonant phonemes of ancient Biblical Hebrew; in particular, the letters &lt;ח, ע, ש&gt; could each mark two different phonemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=74–75,77}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a sound shift the letters ח, ע became uniphonic, but (except in Samaritan Hebrew) ש remained multiphonic. The old Babylonian vocalization wrote a superscript ס above the ש to indicate it took the value /s/, while the Masoretes added the [[shin dot]] to distinguish between the two varieties of the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sperber|1959|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aramaic script began developing special final forms for certain letters in the 5th century&amp;nbsp;BCE, though this was not always a consistent rule (as reflected in the Qumran practice).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yardeni|1997|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Matres lectionis''==

The original Hebrew alphabet consisted only of [[consonants]], but gradually the letters א, ה, ו, י, also became used to indicate vowels, known as ''[[matres lectionis]]'' (Latin: "mothers of reading") when used in this function.&lt;ref name="s17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="to1" /&gt; It is thought that this was a product of phonetic development: for instance, *bayt 'house' shifted to בֵּית in construct state but retained its spelling.&lt;ref name="b6"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While no examples of early Hebrew orthography have been found, older [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and [[Moabite language|Moabite]] texts show how First Temple period Hebrew would have been written.&lt;ref name="to1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|pp=221–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenician inscriptions from the tenth century&amp;nbsp;BCE do not indicate ''matres lectionis'' in the middle or the end of a word: ז ( = זה), לפנ (= לפני), similarly to the Hebrew [[Gezer Calendar]]: שערמ (= שעורים), ירח (= ירחו?).&lt;ref name="to1" /&gt; ''Matres lectionis'' were later added word-finally, for instance the [[Mesha inscription]] has בנתי (= בניתי), בללה (= בלילה); however at this stage they were not yet used word-medially, compare [[Siloam inscription]] זדה versus אש =) איש).&lt;ref name="to1" /&gt; The relative terms ''defective'' and ''full'' or ''plene'' are used to refer to alternative spellings of a word with less or more ''matres lectionis'', respectively.&lt;ref name="to1" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;[[Ktiv male]], the Hebrew term for full spelling, has become de rigueur in Modern Hebrew.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew Bible was presumably originally written in a more defective orthography than found in any of the texts known today.&lt;ref name="to1" /&gt; Of the extant textual witnesses of the Hebrew Bible, the Masoretic text is generally the most conservative in its use of ''matres lectionis'', with the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] and its forebearers being more full and the Qumran tradition showing the most liberal use of vowel letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|pp=96,108,222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Masoretic text mostly uses vowel letters for long vowels, showing the tendency to mark all long vowels except for word-internal /aː/.&lt;ref name="b6" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;There are rare-cases of &lt;א&gt; being used medially as a true vowel letter, e.g. דָּאג for the usual דָּג 'fish'. Most cases, however, of &lt;&amp;#x200E;א&gt; being used as a vowel letter stem from conservative spelling of words which originally contained /ʔ/, e.g. רֹאשׁ 'head' from original */raʔʃ/. See {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a number of exceptions, e.g. when the following syllable contains a vowel letter (as in קֹלֹוֹת 'voices' rather than קוֹלוֹת) or when a vowel letter already marks a consonant (so גּוֹיִם 'nations' rather than גּוֹיִים*), and within the Bible there is often little consistency in spelling.&lt;ref name="b6" /&gt; In the Qumran tradition, o- and u-type vowels, including short holem (מושה, פוה, חושך), qamets hatuf (חוכמה, כול), and hatef qamets (אוניה), are usually represented by &lt;ו&gt;.&lt;ref name="tq1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sq"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sáenz-Badillos|1993|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;י&gt; is generally used for both long [iː] and tsere (אבילים, מית), and final [iː] is often written as יא- in analogy to היא, הביא, e.g. כיא, sometimes מיא.&lt;ref name="tq1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sq" /&gt; &lt;ה&gt; is found finally in forms like חוטה (Tiberian חוטא), קורה (Tiberian קורא), while &lt;א&gt; may be used for a-quality in final position (e.g. עליהא) and in medial position (e.g. יאתום)&lt;ref name="tq1" /&gt; Pre-Samaritan and Samaritan texts show full spellings in many categories (e.g. כוחי vs. Masoretic כחי in Genesis 49:3) but only rarely show full spelling of the Qumran type (but see Genesis 24:41b Samaritan נקיא vs. Masoretic נקי).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|pp=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocalization ==
{{Further|Tiberian vocalization|Babylonian vocalization|Palestinian vocalization|Secunda (Hexapla)}}

In general the vowels of Biblical Hebrew were not indicated in the original text, but various sources attest them at various stages of development. Greek and Latin transcriptions of words from the Biblical text provide early evidence of the nature of Biblical Hebrew vowels. In particular, there is evidence from the rendering of proper nouns in the [[Koine Greek]] [[Septuagint]] (3rd-2nd centuries&amp;nbsp;BCE&lt;ref name="Jobes and Silva"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Karen H. Jobes]] and [[Moises Silva]] |coauthors= |title=Invitation to the Septuagint |year=2001 |publisher=[[Paternoster Press]] |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OysSAQAAIAAJ&amp;q |isbn=1-84227-061-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the Greek alphabet [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of the Hebrew Biblical text contained in the [[Secunda (Hexapla)|Secunda]] (3rd century&amp;nbsp;CE, likely a copy of a preexisting text from before 100&amp;nbsp;BCE&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The [[Secunda (Hexapla)|Secunda]] is a transliteration of the Hebrew Biblical text contained in the [[Hexapla]], a recension of the Old Testament compiled by [[Origen]] in the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;CE. There is evidence that the text of the Secunda was written before 100&amp;nbsp;BCE, despite the later date of the Hexapla. For example, by the time of Origen &lt;η αι&gt; were pronounced [iː ɛː], a merger which had already begun around 100&amp;nbsp;BCE, while in the Secunda they are used to represent Hebrew /eː aj/, see {{Harvcoltxt|Janssens|1982|pp=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). In the 7th and 8th centuries&amp;nbsp;CE various systems of vocalic notation were developed to indicate vowels in the Biblical text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ben-Ḥayyim|2000|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent, best preserved, and the only system still in use, is the [[Tiberian vocalization]] system, created by scholars known as Masoretes around 850&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref name="b7"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rvoc" /&gt; There are also various extant manuscripts making use of less common vocalization systems ([[Babylonian vocalization|Babylonian]], and [[Palestinian vocalization|Palestinian]]), known as ''superlinear vocalizations'' because their vocalization marks are placed above the letters.&lt;ref name="b7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rvoc" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The Palestinian system has two main subtypes and shows great variation. {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=7}} The Babylonian vocalization occurred in two main types (simple / ''einfach'' and complex / ''kompliziert''), with various subgroups differing as to their affinity with the Tiberian tradition. {{Harvcoltxt|Sáenz-Badillos|1993|pp=97–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In the Babylonian and Palestinian systems only the most important vowels were written, see {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Samaritan Hebrew|Samaritan]] reading tradition is independent of these systems, and was occasionally notated with a separate vocalization system.&lt;ref name="rvoc"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rendsburg|1997|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ben-Ḥayyim|2000|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Almost all vocalized manuscripts use the [[Masoretic Text]]. However there are some vocalized Samaritan manuscripts from the Middle Ages, see {{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems often record vowels at different stages of historical development; for example, the name of the Judge [[Samson]] is recorded in Greek as Σαμψών ''Sampsōn'' with the first vowel as /a/, while Tiberian שִמְשוֹן /ʃimʃon/ with /i/ shows the effect of the law of attenuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Waltke|O'Connor|1990|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these systems together are used to reconstruct the original vocalization of Biblical Hebrew.

The Tiberian vowel-sign ''šwa'' (ְ ) was used both to indicate lack of a vowel (''quiescent šwa'') and as another symbol to represent the phoneme /ă/, also represented by ''ḥataf pataḥ'' (ֲ).&lt;ref name="b117-118"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b105-106"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before a laryngeal-pharyngeal, mobile šwa was pronounced as an ultrashort copy of the following vowel, e.g. וּבָקְעָה [uvɔqɔ̆ʕɔ], and as [ĭ] preceding /j/, e.g. תְדֵמְּיוּ֫נִי /θăðammĭjuni/.&lt;ref name="b105-106" /&gt; By contrast, ḥataf pataḥ would only used be used when pronounced [ă].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Palestinian system these echo vowels were written with full vowel letters, see {{Harvcoltxt|Yahalom|1997|pp=12,18–19}} Pronunciation of šwa is attested by alternations in manuscripts like ארֲריך~ארְריך, ואשמֳעָה~ואשמְעָה.&lt;ref name="b105-106" /&gt; Use of ḥataf vowels was considered mandatory under gutturals but optional under other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yeivin|1980|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Punctuation ==

At an early stage, documents written in the paleo-Hebrew script were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran.&lt;ref name="tsp" /&gt; Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for Biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nachmanides in his introduction to the Torah.&lt;ref name="tsp" /&gt; Word division using spaces was commonly used from the beginning of the 7th century&amp;nbsp;BCE for documents in the Aramaic script.&lt;ref name="tsp"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|pp=208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses [[cantillation]] marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=7,143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yeivin|1980|pp=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reading traditions ==

While the Tiberian, Babylonian, and Palestinian reading traditions are extinct, various other systems of pronunciation have evolved over time, notably the [[Yemenite Hebrew language|Yemenite]], [[Sephardi Hebrew language|Sephardi]], [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]], and [[Samaritan Hebrew language|Samaritan]] traditions. [[Modern Hebrew]] pronunciation is also used by some to read Biblical texts. The modern reading traditions do not stem solely from the Tiberian system; for instance, the Sephardic tradition's distinction between qamatz gadol and qatan is pre-Tiberian.&lt;ref name="length"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the only orthographic system used to mark vowels is the Tiberian vocalization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7281">'''Body fluids''', '''bodily fluids''', or '''biofluids''' are [[liquid]]s within the [[human body|bodies of living people]]. In normal healthy  men, the [[total body water]] is about 60% of the total [[body weight]]; it is slightly lower in women. A 70 kg (160 pound) man, then, has 42 liters of water in his body. This is divided between ICF and ECF in a two-to-one ratio: 28 liters are inside cells and 14 liters are outside cells. This ECF compartment is divided into the fluid between cells - the [[interstitial fluid]] volume -  and the [[vascular]] volume, also called the [[blood plasma]] volume. The vascular volume is divided into the [[venous]] volume and the secreted [[arterial]] volume; and the arterial volume has a conceptually useful but unmeasurable subcompartment called the [[effective arterial blood volume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-381462-3.00037-9| title = Natriuretic Hormones| work = Seldin and Giebisch's The Kidney| pages = 1241| year = 2013| last1 = Vesely| first1 = David L| isbn = 9780123814623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately 6 to 10 liters of lymph in the body, compared to 3.5 to 5 liters of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diagnose-me.com/cond/C162576.html |title=Lymphatic Congestion - Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment and Information |publisher=Diagnose-me.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
Body fluid is the term most often used in medical and health contexts. Modern [[medical]], [[public health]], and personal [[hygiene]] practices treat body fluids as potentially unclean. This is because they can be [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s for infectious diseases, such as [[sexually transmitted disease]]s or [[blood-borne disease]]s. [[Universal precautions]] and [[safer sex]] practices try to avoid exchanges of body fluids.  Body fluids can be analyzed in [[medical laboratory]] in order to find microbes, inflammation, cancers, etc.

===Clinical samples===
Clinical samples are generally defined as non-infectious human or animal materials including [[blood]], [[saliva]], [[excreta]], [[body tissue]] and [[tissue fluid]]s, and also [[pharmaceuticals|FDA-approved pharmaceuticals]] that are [[blood products]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fedex.com/us/packaging/guides/Clinical_fxcom.pdf Packaging Guidelines for Clinical Samples] - Retrieved 7 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  In medical contexts, it is a specimen taken for [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostic examination]] or evaluation, and for identification of [[disease]] or condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/specimen specimen] - www.thefreedictionary.com. Retrieved 7 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampling===
Methods of [[sampling (medicine)|sampling]] of body fluids include:
* ''Blood sampling'' for any [[blood test]], in turn including:
** [[Artery|Arterial]] blood sampling, such as [[radial artery puncture]]
** [[Venous]] blood sampling, also called [[venipuncture]]
* [[Lumbar puncture]] to sample [[cerebrospinal fluid]]
* [[Thoracocentesis]] to sample [[pleural fluid]]
* [[Amniocentesis]] to sample [[amniotic fluid]]

==Body fluids in art==
A relatively new trend in [[contemporary art]] is to use [[body fluids in art]], though there have been rarer uses of blood (and perhaps feces) for quite some time, and [[Marcel Duchamp]] used [[semen]] decades ago.  Examples include:

* ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1987), by [[Andres Serrano]], which is a [[photograph]] of a [[crucifix]] submerged in [[urine]];
*In [[Janine Antoni]]'s Conduit (2009) she created a copper cast gargoyle device that she could pee through on the top of the Chrysler Building, Antoni's urine acting as the patina.
* [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''Oxidations'' series, begun in 1977, in which he invited friends to urinate onto a canvas of metallic copper pigments, so that the uric acid would oxidize into abstract patterns;
* ''Self'' (1991, recast 1996)  by [[Marc Quinn]], a frozen cast of the artist's head made entirely of his own [[blood]];
* ''Piss Flowers,'' by [[Helen Chadwick]] (1991–92), are twelve white-enameled bronzes cast from cavities made by [[urinating]] in snow (though this might not be characterized as the use of bodily fluids ''in'' art, just their use in preparation);
* performances by [[Lennie Lee]] involving feces, blood, vomit from 1990
* many paintings by [[Chris Ofili]], which make use of [[elephant]] [[Feces|dung]] (from 1992).
* [[Gilbert and George]]'s ''The Naked Shit Pictures'' (1995)
* [[Hermann Nitsch]] and Das Orgien Mysterien Theatre use urine, feces, blood and more in their ritual performances.
* [[Franko B]] from 1990 blood letting performances.
* The cover of the [[Metallica]]'s album [[Load (album)|Load]] is an original artwork entitled "Semen and Blood III", one of three photographic studies by [[Andres Serrano]] created in 1990 by mingling the artist's own [[semen]] and [[Bovinae|bovine]] [[blood]] between two sheets of [[Plexiglas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/usernet/awc/awc_workdetail.asp?aid=424202827&amp;gid=424202827&amp;cid=74183&amp;wid=425106400&amp;page=2 |title=Semen &amp; Blood II |publisher=Artnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brass Crescent Awards''', started in 2004 by Shahed Amanullah (founder of the online newsmagazine altmuslim.com) and Aziz Poonawalla (author of the blog City of Brass), is an annual [[competition|contest]] that allows visitors to Muslim or [[Islam]]-themed [[weblog]]s to vote for the best weblogs in various categories.  Nominations and voting are conducted online at the awards website, [http://www.brasscrescent.org brasscrescent.org].  

==Purpose==
The awards describe themselves in this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''What are the [[Brass Crescent]] Awards? They are named for the Story of [[The City of Brass]] in the [[Thousand and One Nights]]. Today, the [[Islamsphere]] is forging a new synthesis of [[Islam and modernity]], and is the intellectual heir to the traditions of philosophy and learning that was once the hallmark of [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]] - a heritage scarcely recognizable today in the Islamic world after a century's ravages of [[colonialism]], tyrants, and [[religious fundamentalism]]. We believe that Islam transcends history, and we are forging history anew for tomorrow's Islam. These awards are a means to honor ourselves and celebrate our nascent community, and promote its growth.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Categories==
Categories as of the 2011/1432 awards include Best Blog, Best Non-Muslim Blog, Best Post or Series, Best Ijtihad, Best Female Blog, Best Thinker, Most Deserving of Wider Recognition, Best Group Blog, and Best Middle-East/Asian Blogger.

[[File:10 years Budapest Open Access Initiative - logo.jpg|thumb|A logo celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Budapest Open Access Initiative in 2012, featuring the [[Széchenyi Chain Bridge]] in Budapest.]]
The '''Budapest Open Access Initiative''' ('''BOAI''') is a public statement of principles relating to [[open access]] to the [[Scientific literature|research literature]],&lt;ref name="earlham.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm|title=Budapest Open Access Initiative, FAQ|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released to the public February 14, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Budapest Open Access Initiative  {{!}} Read the Budapest Open Access Initiative|url = http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read|website = www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arose from a conference convened in [[Budapest]] by the [[Open Society Institute]] on December 1–2, 2001 to promote open access – at the time also known as ''Free Online Scholarship''.&lt;ref name="google.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ybf1Qd74XsC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=Budapest+Open+Access+access+movement+signatures&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o3KTlOnWwx&amp;sig=MtfnYKyI_dXwiolTOSQM_yGTows&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hs3bVLawLKb6ywOfhYL4CA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Budapest%20Open%20Access%20access%20movement%20signatures&amp;f=false|title=Strategies for Preservation of and Open Access to Scientific Data in China ...|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/ten-years-on-researchers-embrace-open-access|title=Ten Years On, Researchers Embrace Open Access|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This small gathering of individuals is recognised as one of the major defining events of the [[open access movement]].&lt;ref name="earlham.edu"/&gt; On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the initiative, it was reaffirmed in 2012 and supplemented with a set of concrete recommendations for achieving "the new goal that within the next ten years, OA will become the default method for distributing new peer-reviewed research in every field and country."&lt;ref name=BOAI-10&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soros.org/openaccess/boai-10-recommendations |title=Ten years on from the Budapest Open Access Initiative: setting the default to open |author= |date=September 11, 2012 |work= |publisher= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AdLcI1TC?url=http://www.soros.org/openaccess/boai-10-recommendations |archivedate=September 12, 2012 |accessdate=September 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.lib.sun.ac.za/index.php/BOAI|title=BOAI|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiative==
The opening sentence of the Budapest Open Access Initiative encapsulates what the open access movement is all about, and what its potential is:
{{quote|text=An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an unprecedented public good. The old tradition is the willingness of scientists and scholars to publish the fruits of their research in scholarly journals without payment, for the sake of inquiry and knowledge. The new technology is the internet. The public good they make possible is the world-wide electronic distribution of the peer-reviewed journal literature and completely free and unrestricted access to it by all scientists, scholars, teachers, students, and other curious minds.|source=Budapest Open Access Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Read the Budapest Open Access Initiative|url = http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read|website = www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;!-- commenting out for the time being, as it is largely repetitive to the quote but may still be useful when rephrasing
The old tradition is academic scholars giving away the results of their research. Faculty at universities are paid by universities and/or funding agencies to produce research; disseminating the results in [[peer review]]ed venues is an expectation. Journals do not buy the articles from the authors or pay royalties on sales.  The new technology is the [[Internet]]. Together, these have made it possible for everyone in the world to share knowledge freely and openly. --&gt;

== Definition of open access ==
The document also contains one of the most widely used definitions of open access, which has subsequently been reaffirmed&lt;ref name=BOAI-10/&gt; as ''the'' definition of open access, 10 years after it was first published:

{{quote|text=By "open access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.}}

==Signatories==
The 16 original signatories of the Budapest Open Access Initiative included some of the world's early leaders in the open access movement:  [[Leslie Chan]] of [[Bioline International]]; [[Darius Cuplinskas]], [[Melissa Hagemann]], [[Rima Kupryte]] and [[István Rév]] of [[Open Society Institute]]; [[Michael Eisen]] of the [[Public Library of Science]]; [[Fred Friend]] († April 23, 2014) of [[University College London]]; [[Yana Genova]] of [[Next Page Foundation]]; [[Jean-Claude Guédon]] of the [[Université de Montréal]]; [[Stevan Harnad]] of the [[University of Southampton]]/[[Université du Québec à Montréal]]; Rick Johnson of the [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]] (SPARC); [[Manfredi La Manna]] of the [[Electronic Society for Social Scientists]]; [[Monika Segbert]], [[Electronic Information for Libraries]] ([[eIFL.net]]) Project consultant; [[Sidnei de Souza]], Informatics Director at [[Music Canada|CRIA]], [[Bioline International]]; [[Peter Suber]], Professor of Philosophy, [[Earlham College]] and [[The Free Online Scholarship Newsletter]]; [[Jan Velterop]] of [[BioMed Central]].&lt;ref name="google.se"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/list_signatures?b_start:int=600|title=Budapest Open Access Initiative  - Budapest Open Access Initiative|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2002, the BOAI was released in a version that could be signed by the public. As on 14th Feb. 2016, more than 5,932 individuals and 837 organizations have signed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=View Signatures|url=http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/list_signatures|website=Budapest Open Access Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The initiative was sponsored with a USD $3 million grant from the [[Open Society Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1818652.stm |title=Boost for research paper access |first=Ivan |last=Noble |work=[[BBC News]] |date=14 February 2002 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4360">'''Character encoding detection''', '''charset detection''', or '''code page detection''' is the process of [[heuristic]]ally guessing the [[character encoding]] of a series of bytes that represent text. The technique is recognised to be unreliable and is only used when specific [[metadata]], such as a HTTP &lt;tt&gt;Content-Type:&lt;/tt&gt; header is either not available, or is assumed to be untrustworthy.

This algorithm usually involves statistical analysis of byte patterns, like frequency distribution of [[Digraphs and trigraphs|trigraphs]] of various languages encoded in each code page that will be detected; such statistical analysis can also be used to perform [[language detection]]. This process is not foolproof because it depends on statistical data.

In general, incorrect charset detection leads to [[mojibake]].

One of the few cases where charset detection works reliably is detecting [[UTF-8]]. This is due to the large percentage of invalid byte sequences in UTF-8, so that text in any other encoding that uses bytes with the high bit set is ''extremely'' unlikely to pass a UTF-8 validity test. However, badly written charset detection routines do not run the reliable UTF-8 test first, and may decide that UTF-8 is some other encoding. For example, it was common that web sites in UTF-8 containing the name of the German city [[München]] were shown as MÃ¼nchen.

[[UTF-16]] is fairly reliable to detect due to the high number of newlines (U+000A) and spaces (U+0020) that should be found when dividing the data into 16-bit words, and the fact that few encodings use 16-bit words. This process is not foolproof; for example, some versions of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows operating system]] would mis-detect the phrase "[[Bush hid the facts]]" (without a newline) in ASCII as Chinese [[UTF-16LE]].

Charset detection is particularly unreliable in Europe, in an environment of mixed [[ISO-8859]] encodings. These are closely related eight-bit encodings that share an overlap in their lower half with [[ASCII]]. There is no technical way to tell these encodings apart and recognising them relies on identifying language features, such as letter frequencies or spellings.

Due to the unreliability of heuristic detection, it is better to properly label datasets with the correct encoding. HTML documents served across the web by [[HTTP]] should have their encoding stated [[Out-of-band data|out-of-band]] using the &lt;tt&gt;Content-Type:&lt;/tt&gt; header.
 Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8

An isolated HTML document, such as one being edited as a file on disk, may imply such a header by a meta tag within the file:
&lt;source lang="html4strict"&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" &gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
or with a new meta type in HTML5&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web
  |title=4.2.5 The meta element
  |publisher=W3C
  |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#attr-meta-charset
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="html"&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8" &gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

If the document is Unicode, then some UTF encodings explicitly label the document with an embedded initial [[byte order mark]] (BOM).

In linguistics, a '''chroneme''' is a basic, theoretical unit of sound that can distinguish words by duration only of a vowel or consonant. The noun ''chroneme'' is derived from Greek χρόνος (chrónos, ''time''), and the suffixed ''-eme'', which is analogous to the ''-eme'' in ''[[phoneme]]'' or ''[[morpheme]]''. However, the term does not have wide currency and may be unknown even to phonologists who work on languages claimed to have chronemes.

Most languages have differences in [[length (phonetics)|length]] of vowels or consonants, but in the case of most languages it would not be treated phonemically or phonologically as distinctive or contrastive. Even in those languages which do have phonologically contrastive length, a chroneme is only posited in particular languages. Use of a chroneme views {{IPA|/aː/}} as being composed of two [[segment (linguistics)|segments]]: {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ː/}}, whereas in a particular analysis, {{IPA|/aː/}} may be considered a single segment with length one of its [[distinctive feature|features]]. This may be compared to the analysis of a [[diphthong]] like {{IPA|[ai]}} as a single segment {{IPA|/ai/}} or as the sequence of a vowel and consonant: {{IPA|/aj/}}.

For the purposes of analysis of a chronemic contrast, two words with different meaning that are spoken exactly the same except for length of one segment are considered a [[minimal pair]].

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) denotes length by doubling the letter or by diacritics above or after the letters:

{| class="wikitable"
! symbol || position || meaning
|-
| style="font-size:larger;text-align:center;" |''none'' || - || short
|-
| style="font-size:larger;text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ː}} || after || long
|-
| style="font-size:larger;text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ˑ}} || after || half-long
|-
| style="font-size:larger;text-align:center;" | {{IPA|˘}} || above || extra-short
|}

American English does not have minimal pairs indicating the existence of chronemes or may theoretically be said to have only one chroneme. Some other dialects such as [[Australian English phonology|Australian English]] have contrastive vowel length, but it is not analysed as the consequence of a chroneme.

Many [[Indo-European languages]], including Classical [[Latin]], have distinctive length in consonants, for example in [[Italian language|Italian]]:

{|class="wikitable"
! word || IPA ||meaning
|-
| vile ||{{IPA|/ˈvile/}}|| coward
|-
| ville ||{{IPA|/ˈville/}} || villas
|}

Classical Latin, [[German language|German]], some [[Languages of Italy|Italian dialects]] and [[Thai language|Thai]] have distinctive length in [[vowel]]s. For example, in Thai:

{|class="wikitable"
! word || IPA || RTGS || quality || meaning
|-
| เข้า || {{IPA|/kʰâw/}} || khâo || short || enter
|-
| ข้าว || {{IPA|/kʰâːw/}} || khâo || long || rice
|}

Or consider, for example, the cŭ/cū [[minimal pair]] in the dialect spoken near [[Palmi]] ([[Calabria]], [[Italy]]):

{|class="wikitable"
! Dialect spoken in Palmi || IPA || Quality || Etymology || Latin || Italian || English
|-
| Cŭ voli? || {{IPA|/kuˈvɔːli/}} || short || cŭ &lt; lat. ''qu(is)'' ("who?") || Quis vult? || Chi vuole? || Who wants?
|-
| Cū voli? || {{IPA|/kuːˈvɔːli/}} || long || cū &lt; lat. ''qu(o) (ill)ŭ(m)'' ("for-what him?") || Quō illum/illud vult? || Per che cosa lo vuole? || For what (reason) does he want him/it?
|}

Almost all [[Uralic languages]], such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] have a distinctive [[mora (linguistics)|moraic]] chroneme as a [[phoneme]] (also arguably called [[archiphoneme]] or [[epenthetic vowel]]/consonant). The etymology of the vocalic chroneme has been traced to a [[voiced velar fricative]] in the hypothetical [[Proto-Uralic]] language, such that {{IPA|[Vɣ]}} becomes {{IPA|[Vː]}}. For example, ''taka-'' "back-", ''takka'' "fireplace" and ''taakka'' "burden" are unrelated words. It is also grammatically important; the third person marker is a chroneme (''menee'' "s/he goes"), and often in the [[spoken Finnish]] of the Helsinki area there are grammatical minimal pairs, e.g. nominative ''Stadi'' "Helsinki" vs. partitive ''Stadii'' "at Helsinki".

In Finnish, Estonian and [[Sami languages]], there are also two [[allophone|allophonic]] lengths of the chroneme, ''half-long'' and ''over-long''. For example, Finnish imperative ''ann'''a'''!'' "give!" has a short vowel, ''om'''a''''' "own" has a half-long vowel, and ''Ann'''aa''''' "at Anna" has an overlong vowel (without any distinctive tonal variation to distinguish these three). Estonian and Sami also have a three-way distinction in consonants, e.g. ''li'''n'''a'' "bed sheet", ''li'''nn'''a'' (half-long 'n')  "of the city", ''li'''nn'''a'' (over-long 'n') "to the city". Estonian, in which the phonemic opposition is the strongest, uses tonal contour as a secondary cue to distinguish the two; "over-long" is falling as in other Finnic languages, but "half-long" is rising.

Finnish also denotes stress principally by adding more length (approximately 100&amp;nbsp;ms) to the vowel of the syllable nucleus. This means that Finnish has five different physical lengths. (The half-long vowel is a phonemically short vowel appearing in the second syllable, if the first—and thus stressed—syllable is a single short vowel.) The unstressed short vowels are about 40&amp;nbsp;ms in physical duration, the unstressed long vowels about 70&amp;nbsp;ms. The stress adds about 100&amp;nbsp;ms, giving short stressed as 130–150&amp;nbsp;ms and long stressed as 170–180&amp;nbsp;ms. The half-long vowel, which is always short unstressed, is distinctively longer than the standard 40&amp;nbsp;ms.

[[Japanese language|Japanese]] is another language in which vowel length is distinctive. For example, ''biru'' is a foreign loan word (clipped from a longer form) that means "building" whereas ''bīru'' is a foreign loan word for "beer". Using a notion intuitive to a speaker of Japanese, it could be said that more than anything, what differentiates ''bīru'' from ''biru'' is an extra mora (or minimal vowel syllable) in the speech rhythm that signifies a lengthening of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}. However, upon observation one might also note a rise in pitch and intensity of the longer vowel. It could be said, also, that vowel lengthening—chronemic contrasts—nearly doubles Japanese's rather small inventory of vowel phonemes (though the occurrence of diphthongs also augments vowel counts). Due to native literacy practices, Japanese long vowels are often thought of as sequences of two vowels of the same quality (rather than one vowel of a greater quantity or length) since that is how they are sometimes written.

In the case of consonants of Japanese, if treated phonemically, a medial consonant might appear to double, thus creating a contrast, for example, between the word ''hiki'' (meaning 'pull' or 'influence') and ''hikki'' (meaning 'writing'). In terms of articulation and phonetics, the difference between the two words would be that, in the latter ''hikki'', the doubled {{IPA|[kk]}} closes the first syllable {{IPA|[hi-]}} and is realized in the glottis as glottal plosive stop (with some anticipatory articulation evident in the velum of the mouth, where a {{IPA|/k/}} is usually made) while starting the next syllable {{IPA|[-ki]}} as a {{IPA|[k]}} articulated and realized as the regular velar sound. In effect, this consonant doubling then adds one mora to the overall speech rhythm and timing. Hence, among other contrasts, the word ''hik-ki'' is felt to be one mora or beat longer than ''hi-ki'' by a speaker of Japanese. &lt;!--Isn't this essentially the same as Italian?--&gt;

{{Orphan|date=August 2017}}

In mathematics, a '''compact semigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] in which the sets of solutions to equations can be described by finite sets of equations.  The term "compact" here does not refer to any [[topology]] on the semigroup.

Let ''S'' be a semigroup and ''X'' a finite set of letters.  A system of equations is a subset ''E'' of the [[Cartesian product]] ''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; × ''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; of the [[free monoid]] (finite strings) over ''X'' with itself.  The system ''E'' is satisfiable in ''S'' if there is a map ''f'' from ''X'' to ''S'', which extends to a [[semigroup morphism]] ''f'' from ''X''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to ''S'', such that for all (''u'',''v'') in ''E'' we have ''f''(''u'') = ''f''(''v'') in ''S''.  Such an ''f'' is a ''solution'', or ''satisfying assignment'', for the system ''E''.&lt;ref name=LotII444&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;444&lt;/ref&gt;

Two systems of equations are ''equivalent'' if they have the same set of satisfying assignments.  A system of equations if ''independent'' if it is not equivalent to a proper subset of itself.&lt;ref name=LotII444/&gt;  A semigroup is ''compact'' if every independent system of equations is finite.&lt;ref name=LotII458&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;458&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* A free monoid on a finite alphabet is compact.&lt;ref name=LotII447&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;447&lt;/ref&gt;
* A free monoid on a countable alphabet is compact.&lt;ref name=LotII461&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;461&lt;/ref&gt;
* A finitely generated [[free group]] is compact.&lt;ref name=LotII462&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;462&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[trace monoid]] on a finite set of generators is compact.&lt;ref name=LotII461/&gt;
* The [[bicyclic monoid]] is not compact.&lt;ref name=LotII459&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;459&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
* The class of compact semigroups is closed under taking subsemigroups and finite direct products.&lt;ref name=LotII460&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;460&lt;/ref&gt;
* The class of compact semigroups is not closed under taking morphic images or infinite direct products.&lt;ref name=LotII460/&gt;

==Varieties==
The class of compact semigroups does not form an [[equational variety]].  However, a variety of monoids has the property that all its memberss are compact if and only if all finitely generated members satisfy the [[maximal condition on congruences]] (any family of congruences, ordered by inclusion, has a maximal element).&lt;ref name=LotII466&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;466&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6892">In [[automata theory]], a '''deterministic pushdown automaton''' ('''DPDA''' or '''DPA''') is a variation of the [[pushdown automaton]]. The class of deterministic pushdown automata accepts the [[deterministic context-free language]]s, a proper subset of [[context-free language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Michael Sipser]] | year = 1997 | title = Introduction to the Theory of Computation | publisher = PWS Publishing | isbn = 0-534-94728-X | page = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine transitions are based on the current state and input symbol, and also the current topmost symbol of the stack.  Symbols lower in the stack are not visible and have no immediate effect. Machine actions include pushing, popping, or replacing the stack top.  A deterministic pushdown automaton has at most one legal transition for the same combination of input symbol, state, and top stack symbol. This is where it differs from the nondeterministic pushdown automaton.

== Formal definition ==
A (not necessarily deterministic) '''PDA''' &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; can be defined as a 7-tuple:

:&lt;math&gt;M=(Q\,, \Sigma\,, \Gamma\,, q_0\,, Z_0\,, A\,, \delta\,)&lt;/math&gt;

where

*&lt;math&gt;Q\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of states
*&lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of input symbols
*&lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of stack symbols
*&lt;math&gt;q_0\,\in Q\,&lt;/math&gt; is the start state
*&lt;math&gt;Z_0\,\in\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; is the starting stack symbol
*&lt;math&gt;A\,\subseteq Q\,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the set of accepting states
*&lt;math&gt;\delta\,&lt;/math&gt; is a transition function, where
:&lt;math&gt;\delta\colon(Q\, \times ( \Sigma\, \cup \left \{ \varepsilon\, \right \} ) \times \Gamma\,) \longrightarrow \mathcal{P}(Q \times \Gamma ^{*})&lt;/math&gt;
: where &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kleene star]], meaning that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is "the set of all finite strings (including the [[empty string]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;) of elements of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;", &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[empty string]], and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[power set]] of a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

''M'' is ''deterministic'' if it satisfies both the following conditions:
* For any &lt;math&gt;q \in Q, a \in \Sigma \cup \left \{ \varepsilon \right \}, x \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\delta(q,a,x)\,&lt;/math&gt; has at most one element.
*For any &lt;math&gt;q \in Q, x \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\delta(q, \varepsilon, x) \not= \emptyset\,&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\delta\left( q,a,x \right) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;a \in \Sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

There are two possible acceptance criteria: acceptance by ''empty stack'' and acceptance by ''final state''. The two are not equivalent for the deterministic pushdown automaton (although they are for the non-deterministic pushdown automaton). The languages accepted by ''empty stack'' are those languages that are accepted by ''final state'' and are prefix-free: no word in the language is the prefix of another word in the language.

The usual acceptance criterion is ''final state'', and it is this acceptance criterion which is used to define the [[deterministic context-free languages]].

== Languages recognized ==

If &lt;math&gt;L(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a language accepted by a PDA &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, it can also be accepted by a DPDA if and only if there is a single computation from the initial configuration until an accepting one for all strings belonging to &lt;math&gt;L(A)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;L(A)&lt;/math&gt; can be accepted by a PDA it is a context free language and if it can be accepted by a DPDA it is a deterministic context-free language.

Not all context-free languages are deterministic. This makes the DPDA a strictly weaker device than the PDA. For example, the language of even-length [[palindrome]]s on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the context-free grammar S → 0S0 | 1S1 | ε.  An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[John Hopcroft|Hopcroft]] | first = John |author2=[[Rajeev Motwani]] |author3=[[Jeffrey Ullman]] | title = [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]] |edition=2 | year = 2001 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | pages = 249–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restricting the DPDA to a single state reduces the class of languages accepted to the [[LL(1) language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kurki-Suonio | first1 = R. | title = Notes on top-down languages | doi = 10.1007/BF01946814 | journal = BIT | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 225–238 | year = 1969 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a PDA, this restriction has no effect on the class of languages accepted.

== Properties ==

=== Closure ===
Closure properties of deterministic context-free languages (accepted by deterministic PDA by final state) are drastically different from the context-free languages. As an example they are (effectively) closed under complementation, but not closed under union. To prove that the complement of a language accepted by a deterministic PDA is also accepted by a deterministic PDA is tricky.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In principle one has to avoid infinite computations.

As a consequence of the complementation it is decidable whether a deterministic PDA accepts all words over its input alphabet, by testing its complement for emptiness. This is not possible for context-free grammars (hence not for general PDA).

=== Equivalence problem ===
Géraud Sénizergues (1997) proved that the equivalence problem for deterministic PDA (i.e. given two deterministic PDA A and B, is L(A)=L(B)?) is decidable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sénizergues|first=Géraud|title=The equivalence problem for deterministic pushdown automata is decidable|journal=Automata, Languages and Programming|year=1997|volume=1256/1997|pages=671–681|doi=10.1007/3-540-63165-8_221|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-540-63165-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a proof that earned him the 2002 [[Gödel Prize]]. For nondeterministic PDA, equivalence is undecidable.

'''Direct fire''' refers to the launching of a projectile directly at a target within the [[Line-of-sight (missile)|line-of-sight]] of the firer.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Johnathan B. A., ''Field Artillery and Firepower'', Naval Institute Press, 2004, p.560&lt;/ref&gt;  The firing weapon must have a [[Sight (device)|sighting device]] and an unobstructed view to the target, which means no objects or friendly units can be between it and the target.  A weapon engaged in direct fire exposes itself to return fire from the target.&lt;ref name=Bailey49&gt;p.49, Bailey&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in contrast to [[indirect fire]], which refers to firing a projectile on a [[ballistic trajectory]] or delivering munitions by guided or unguided [[missile]]s. Indirect fire does not need a direct line of sight to the target because the shots are normally directed by a forward [[Artillery observer|observer]].  As such, indirect fire weapons can shoot over obstacles or friendly units and the weapons can be concealed from [[counter-battery fire]].

==Description==
Examples of direct fire weapons include most ancient and modern weapons such as [[bow and arrow|bows]], [[handgun]]s, [[rifle]]s, [[machine gun]]s, and [[recoilless rifle]]s.  The term is most often used in the context of [[artillery]], such as [[howitzer]]s and [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]].

Direct fire remained the dominant method of operating artillery throughout most of human history, with indirect fire used for [[siege]]s and involving specific [[siege gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;p.211, Bailey&lt;/ref&gt;  Technological developments born of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the development of technical practices in the late 19th Century led to an appreciation of indirect fire, although it was not until [[World War I]] that indirect fire supplanted direct fire as the primary method by which artillery supported the other [[combat arms]].&lt;ref name=Bailey49/&gt;  During [[World War II]] direct fire remained secondary to indirect fire, although it was used profusely in situations where indirect fire was less effective and new direct fire artillery such as [[anti-tank gun]]s and [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were developed.&lt;ref&gt;p.50, Bailey&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II new technology continued to diminish the role of direct fire, however in several situations it remains a necessary function.  One of these is the defense of fixed fortified areas, for example [[fire support base]]s, for which specific firing techniques and munitions such as [[Killer Junior]] and [[Beehive anti-personnel round]]s were developed.&lt;ref&gt;p.51-52, Bailey&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is when artillery is forced to defend itself, such as in a surprise attack.  This could be the result of rapid maneuvering by ground forces, an attack by [[airborne troops]], or from the lack of defined [[front lines]] as found in [[counterinsurgency operations]].&lt;ref&gt;p.52-53, Bailey&lt;/ref&gt;  Direct fire artillery can also be massed to counter a [[penetration (warfare)|penetration]] by enemy [[tanks]].  In particular [[self-propelled artillery]] are ideally suited for this role on account of their mobility, armor protection, and faster [[rate of fire]] compared to other weapons.&lt;ref&gt;p.53-54, Bailey&lt;/ref&gt;  A final situation is in [[urban warfare]], where locating the enemy can be difficult, the physical structures give the defenders better protection, and the risk of [[collateral damage]] is high.  In these cases direct fire artillery can unleash tremendous firepower to precisely destroy enemy fortified positions.&lt;ref&gt;p.83, Bailey&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[graph theory]], the unproven '''Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture''', made in 1995 by the prolific mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] and his collaborator [[András Gyárfás]], states that every [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with minimum [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Definitions|degree]] 3 contains a [[Cycle (graph theory)|simple cycle]] whose length is a [[power of two]]. Erdős offered a prize of $100 for proving the conjecture, or $50 for a counterexample; it is one of many [[Erdős conjecture|conjectures of Erdős]].

If the conjecture is false, a counterexample would take the form of a graph with minimum degree three having no power-of-two cycles. It is known through computer searches of [[Gordon Royle]] and Klas Markström that any counterexample must have at least 17 vertices, and any [[Cubic graph|cubic]] counterexample must have at least 30 vertices. Markström's searches found four graphs on 24 vertices in which the only power-of-two cycles have 16 vertices. One of these four graphs is [[Planar graph|planar]]; however, the Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture is now known to be true for the special case of 3-connected cubic planar graphs {{harv| Heckman|Krakovski|2013}}

Weaker results relating the degree of a graph to unavoidable sets of cycle lengths are known: there is a set ''S'' of lengths, with |''S''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;0.99&lt;/sup&gt;), such that every graph with average degree ten or more contains a cycle with its length in ''S'' {{harv|Verstraëte|2005}}, and every graph whose average degree is exponential in the [[iterated logarithm]] of ''n'' necessarily contains a cycle whose length is a power of two {{harv|Sudakov|Verstraëte|2008}}. The conjecture is also known to be true for planar [[claw-free graph]]s {{harv|Daniel|Shauger|2001}} and for graphs that avoid large induced [[star (graph theory)|star]]s and satisfy additional constraints on their degrees {{harv|Shauger|1998}}.

'''The Federation of Children's Book Groups''' is a national charity in the [[United Kingdom]] that promotes children's books and reading for pleasure for all ages of children, from newborns to teenagers. The organisation is run by volunteers interested in supporting children and their books, both at a national level, through an executive, and a local level, through local groups, with the support also of individuals and professional members. The Federation liaises with publishers, libraries, schools and other bodies with an interest in literacy, reading and young people. 

The Federation owns and coordinates the [[Red House Children's Book Award]], the UK's only national book award voted for entirely by children.

The Federation promotes [[National Share-a-Story Month]] (every May) and [[National Non-Fiction Day]] (every November). It holds an annual conference each spring (with the help of local groups) as well as various one day regional conferences. The Federation regularly publishes booklists for children of different ages, as well as producing newsletters three times a year, and providing general advice and information on children's books and reading for enjoyment.

In 2011 The Federation of Children's Book Groups won the [[Eleanor Farjeon Award]] for distinguished service to the world of British children's books.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/news/4162_the_federation_of_childrens_book_groups_wins_award&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Anne Wood]], a British children's television producer, and creator of the [[Teletubbies]], established the first Book Group to promote enthusiasm for and about children's book in 1965. Soon more groups were created and the Federation of Children's Book Groups was created in 1968. Many of the original local groups are still in existence, though new groups are developing every year.

==Local Book Groups==
There are currently over 25 separate Book Groups throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Each group is different but typically a local group holds
*Meetings for adults to discuss children's books.
*Events with visiting speakers, including authors and illustrators.
*Activities for children such as storytelling and book exhibitions.

In [[computational linguistics]], '''FrameNet''' is a project housed at the [[International Computer Science Institute]] in [[Berkeley, California]] which produces an electronic resource based on a theory of meaning called
[[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]]. FrameNet reveals for example that the sentence "John sold a car to Mary" essentially describes the same basic situation (semantic frame) as "Mary bought a car from John", just from a different perspective. A semantic frame can be thought of as a conceptual structure describing an event, relation, or object and the participants in it. The FrameNet [[lexical database]] contains over 1,200 semantic ''frames'', 13,000 ''lexical units'' (a pairing of a [[word]] with a [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]; [[Polysemy|polysemous]] words are represented by several ''lexical units'') and 202,000 example sentences. FrameNet is largely the creation of [[Charles J. Fillmore]], who developed the theory of frame semantics that the project is based on, and was initially the project leader when the project began in 1997.&lt;ref name="Goddard2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cliff Goddard|title=Semantic Analysis: A Practical Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfar1cmATvUC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=21 March 2012|date=25 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-956028-8|pages=78–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collin Baker became the project manager in 2000.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7plqH2gSq1wC&amp;pg=PP20|accessdate=21 March 2012|editor1-last=Heine|editor1-first=Bernd|editor2-last=Narrog|editor2-first=Heiko|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-160925-1|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FrameNet project has been influential in both linguistics and natural language processing, where it led to the task of automatic [[Semantic Role Labeling]].

==Concepts==

===Frames===
A frame is a schematic representation of a situation involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles. Examples of frame names are &lt;tt&gt;Being_born&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Locative_relation&lt;/tt&gt;. A frame in FrameNet contains a textual description of what it represents (a frame definition), associated frame elements, lexical units, example sentences, and frame-to-frame relations.

===Frame elements===
Frame elements (FE) provide additional information to the semantic structure of a sentence. Each frame has a number of core and non-core FEs which can be thought of as semantic roles. Core FEs are essential to the meaning of the frame while non-core FEs are generally descriptive (such as time, place, manner, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/glossary#core&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples include:

* The only core FE of the &lt;tt&gt;Being_born&lt;/tt&gt; frame is called &lt;tt&gt;Child&lt;/tt&gt;; non-core FEs being &lt;tt&gt;Time&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Place&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Relatives&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/index.php?q=frame_report&amp;name=Being_born&lt;/ref&gt;
* Core FEs of the &lt;tt&gt;Commerce_goods-transfer&lt;/tt&gt; include the &lt;tt&gt;Seller&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Buyer&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Goods&lt;/tt&gt;, among other things, while non-core FEs include a &lt;tt&gt;Place&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Purpose&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/index.php?q=frame_report&amp;name=Commerce_goods-transfer&lt;/ref&gt;

FrameNet includes shallow data on syntactic roles that frame elements play in the example sentences. For an example sentence like "She was born about AD 460", FrameNet would mark "She" as a [[noun phrase]] referring to the &lt;tt&gt;Child&lt;/tt&gt; FE, and "about AD 460" as a [[noun phrase]] corresponding to the &lt;tt&gt;Time&lt;/tt&gt; frame element. Details of how frame elements can be realized in a sentence are important because this reveals important information about the [[subcategorization frame]]s as well as possible [[diathesis alternation]]s (e.g. "John broke the window" vs. "The window broke")
of a verb.

===Lexical units===
Lexical units (LU) are lemmas, with their part of speech, that evoke a specific frame. In other words, when a LU is identified in a sentence, that specific LU can be associated with its specific frame(s). For each frame, there are many LUs associated to one frame and many frames that share multiple LUs, this is typically the case with LUs that have multiple word senses.&lt;ref&gt;https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/glossary&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the frame, each lexical unit is associated with specific frame elements by means of the annotated example sentences.

Example:

Lexical units that evoke the &lt;tt&gt;Complaining&lt;/tt&gt; frame (or more specific perspectivized versions of it, to be precise), include the verbs "complain", "grouse", "lament", and others.&lt;ref&gt;https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/frameIndex.xml?frame=Complaining&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example sentences===
Frames are associated with example sentences and frame elements are marked within the sentences. Thus the sentence
:''She was '''born''' about AD 460''
is associated with the frame &lt;tt&gt;Being_born&lt;/tt&gt;, while "She" is marked as the frame element &lt;tt&gt;Child&lt;/tt&gt; and "about AD 460" is marked as &lt;tt&gt;Time&lt;/tt&gt;.
(See the [http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/displayReport.php?anno=9791 FrameNet Annotation Report] for &lt;tt&gt;born.v&lt;/tt&gt;.)
From the start, the FrameNet project has been committed to looking at evidence from actual language use as found in text collections like the [[British National Corpus]]. 
Based on such example sentences, automatic [[semantic role labeling]] tools are able to determine frames and mark frame elements in new sentences.

===Valences===
FrameNet also exposes the statistics on the ''valences'' of the ''frames'', that is the number and the position of the ''frame elements'' within example sentences. The sentence
:''She was '''born''' about AD 460''
falls in the valence pattern
:'''NP Ext, INI --, NP Dep'''
which occurs two times in the [https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/lu/lu9791.xml example sentences] in FrameNet,
namely in:
:She'' was '''born''' ''about AD 460'', daughter and granddaughter of Roman and Byzantine emperors, whose family had been prominent in Roman politics for over 700 years.''
:''He was soon posted to north Africa, and never met their only child, ''a daughter'' '''born''' ''8 June 1941''.''

===Frame Relations===

FrameNet additionally captures relationships between different frames using relations. These include the following.

* Inheritance: When one frame is a more specific version of another, more abstract parent frame. Anything that is true about the parent frame must also be true about the child frame, and a mapping is specified between the frame elements of the parent and the frame elements of the child.
* Perspectivized_in: A neutral frame (like &lt;tt&gt;Commerce_transfer-goods&lt;/tt&gt;) is connected to a frame with a specific perspective of the same scenario (e.g. the &lt;tt&gt;Commerce_sell&lt;/tt&gt; frame, which assumes the perspective of the seller or the &lt;tt&gt;Commerce_buy&lt;/tt&gt; frame, which assumes the perspective of the buyer)
* Subframe: Some frames like the &lt;tt&gt;Criminal_process&lt;/tt&gt; frame refer to complex scenarios that consist of several individual states or events that can be described by separate frames like &lt;tt&gt;Arrest&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Trial&lt;/tt&gt;, and so on.
* Precedes: The Precedes relation captures a temporal order that holds between subframes of a complex scenario.
* Causative_of and Inchoative_of: There is a fairly systematic relationship between stative descriptions (e.g. the &lt;tt&gt;Position_on_a_scale&lt;/tt&gt; frame, "She had a high salary") and causative descriptions (&lt;tt&gt;Cause_change_of_scalar_position&lt;/tt&gt;, "She raised his salary") or inchoative descriptions (&lt;tt&gt;Change_position_on_a_scale&lt;/tt&gt;, e.g. "Her salary increased").
* Using: A relationship that holds between a frame that in some way involves another frame. For instance, the &lt;tt&gt;Judgment_communication&lt;/tt&gt; frame uses both the &lt;tt&gt;Judgment&lt;/tt&gt; frame and the &lt;tt&gt;Statement&lt;/tt&gt; frame, but does not inherit from either of them because there is no clear correspondence of the frame elements.
* See_also: Connects frames that bear some resemblance but need to be distinguished carefully.

==Applications==

FrameNet has proven useful in a number of computational applications, because computers need additional knowledge in order to recognize that "John sold a car to Mary" and "Mary bought a car from John" describe essentially the same situation, despite using two quite different verbs, different prepositions and a different word order. FrameNet has been used in applications like [[question answering]], paraphrasing, recognizing textual entailment, and information extraction, either directly or by means of [[Semantic Role Labeling]] tools. The first automatic system for [[Semantic Role Labeling]] (SRL, sometimes also referred to as "shallow semantic parsing") was developed by Daniel Gildea and [[Daniel Jurafsky]] based on FrameNet in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1162/089120102760275983| volume = 28| issue = 3| pages = 245–288| last1 = Gildea| first1 = Daniel| last2 = Jurafsky| first2 = Daniel| title = Automatic Labeling of Semantic Roles| journal = Computational Linguistics| date = 2002| url = https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~gildea/gildea-cl02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic Role Labeling has since become one of the standard tasks in natural language processing, with the latest version (1.7) of FrameNet now fully supported in the [[Natural Language Toolkit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Schneider| first1 = Nathan| last2 = Wooters| first2 = Chuck| title = The NLTK FrameNet API: Designing for Discoverability with a Rich Linguistic Resource| journal = EMNLP 2017: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing| date = 2017| url = http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since frames are essentially semantic descriptions, they are similar across languages, and several projects have arisen over the years that have relied on the original FrameNet as the basis for additional non-English FrameNets, for Spanish, Japanese, German, and Polish, among others.

[[File:Deutsche Dialekte 1910.png|400px|thumb|Distribution of Continental West Germanic varieties circa 1910]]
'''German dialects''' concern [[dialect]]s of [[German language|German]]. They are dominated by the geographical spread of the [[High German consonant shift]], and the [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]] that connect German to the neighbouring varieties of [[Low Franconian]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and [[Frisian languages|Frisian]].

The varieties of German are conventionally grouped into [[Upper German]], [[Central German]] and [[Low German]]; Upper and Central German form the [[High German]] subgroup. [[Standard German]] is a standardized form of High German, developed in the [[early modern period]] based on a combination of Central German and Upper German varieties.

==Dialects==
===In relation to varieties of standard German===
In [[linguistics]] of German, German [[dialect]]s are distinguished from [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[Standard German]].

*The German dialects are the traditional local varieties. They are traced back to the different Germanic tribes. Many of them are hardly understandable to someone who knows only Standard German, since they often differ from Standard German in [[lexicon]], [[phonology]] and [[syntax]]. If a narrow definition of [[language]] based on [[mutual intelligibility]] is used, many German dialects are considered to be separate languages (for example, in the view of [[Ethnologue]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, such a point of view is unusual in German linguistics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
*The varieties of standard German refer to the different local varieties of the [[pluricentric language]] standard German. They only differ slightly in lexicon and phonology. In certain regions they have replaced the traditional German dialects, especially in Northern Germany.

===Dialects in Germany===

The variation among the German dialects is considerable with only the neighbouring dialects being [[mutually intelligible]]. Low German, most Upper German, High Franconian dialects, and even some Central German dialects when spoken in their purest form, are not intelligible to people who know only Standard German. However, all German dialects belong to the [[dialect continuum]] of High German and Low German. In the past (roughly until the end of [[World War II]]), there was a [[dialect continuum]] of all the continental [[West Germanic languages]] because nearly any pair of neighbouring dialects were perfectly mutually intelligible.

The German dialect continuum is typically divided into [[High German languages|High German]] and [[Low German]]. The terms derive from the geographic characteristics of the terrain where they are spoken rather than from social status accorded to them.

===Low German===
{{main|Low German}}
Low German varieties (in Germany usually referred to as "Platt" or "Plattdeutsch") are considered dialects of the German language by some but a separate language by others (then often termed "Low Saxon"). Linguistically Low German (that is, [[Ingvaeonic]]) and [[Low Franconian]] (that is, [[Low Franconian languages|Istvaeonic]]) dialects are grouped together because both did not participate in the [[High German consonant shift]]. Low German is further divided into [[Dutch Low Saxon]], [[West Low German]] and [[East Low German]].

[[Middle Low German]] was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} It was the predominant language in Northern Germany, and several translations of the Bible were printed in Low German. This predominance changed in the 16th century. In 1534, the [[Luther Bible]] was printed by [[Martin Luther]]; this translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the [[Early New High German]]. It aimed to be understandable to an ample audience and was based mainly on [[High German]] varieties. The Early New High German language gained more prestige than Low Saxon {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} and became the language of science and literature. Other factors included the Hanseatic League losing its importance around the same time (as new trade routes to Asia and the [[Americas]] were established) and that the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.

The 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass [[education]] with the language of the schools being standard German.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Today, Low Saxon could be divided in two groups: Low Saxon varieties with a sizable standard German influx,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} and varieties of standard German with a Low Saxon influence ([[Missingsch]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Today Low Saxon dialects are still widespread, especially among the elderly in the Northern parts of Germany,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} many of these being able to understand and speak the language, but younger people in Northern Germany are at least able to understand these dialects, though not to speak them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The local media take care not to let the Low Saxon language die out, so there are several newspapers published entirely in this language; other newspapers at least have recurring articles in Low Saxon. The North German Broadcasting ([[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]]) also offers TV programs (e.g. "Talk op Platt") and radio programs in Low Saxon.

{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
On the other hand, Northern Germany is considered to be the region where the purest Standard German is spoken, and in everyday life little influence of dialect is heard. Still, there are notable differences in pronunciation even among North German speakers, e.g. lengthening of vowels, differences in accentuation etc. There are also some North German expressions in use even in Standard High German, which are seldom heard in Southern parts (e.g. the word "plietsch" for "intelligent").

===High German===
{{main|High German}}
[[High German]], that is, [[High German languages|Irminonic]], is divided into [[Central German]], [[High Franconian]], and [[Upper German language|Upper German]].

Central German dialects include [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]], [[Moselle Franconian]], [[Central Hessian]], [[East Hessian]], [[North Hessian]], [[Thuringian]], [[North Upper Saxon]], [[Rhine Franconian]], [[Lorraine Franconian]], [[Silesian German]], [[High Prussian]], 
[[Lausitzisch-neumärkisch dialects|Lausitzisch-neumärkisch]] and [[Upper Saxon dialect|Upper Saxon]]. It is spoken in the southeastern Netherlands, eastern Belgium, Luxembourg, parts of France, and in Germany approximately between the River [[Main (river)|Main]] and the southern edge of the Lowlands. Modern Standard German is based on Central and Upper German, but the usual German term for modern Standard German is ''Hochdeutsch'', that is, High German.

The Moselle Franconian varieties spoken in [[Luxembourg]] have been officially standardized and institutionalized and are therefore usually considered a separate language known as [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]].

High Franconian dialects are transitional dialects in between the two greater [[High German]] groups. High Franconian dialects include [[East Franconian]] and [[South Franconian]].

Upper German dialects include [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], [[Swabian German|Swabian]], [[Low Alemannic]], [[Central Alemannic]], [[High Alemannic]], [[Highest Alemannic]], [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]], [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] and [[Northern Austro-Bavarian]]. They are spoken in parts of the [[Alsace]], southern Germany, Liechtenstein, Austria, and in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland and Italy.

[[Wymysorys language|Wymysorys]], [[Sathmarisch]] and [[Siebenbürgisch]] are High German dialects of Poland and [[Romania]].

The High German varieties spoken by [[Ashkenazi Jew]]s (mostly in Czarist [[Russia]], then the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Poland]]) have several unique features, and are usually considered as a separate language, [[Yiddish]]. It is the only Germanic language that does not use the [[Latin script]] as its [[official script|standard script]]. Since it developed in the Danube area, there are some similarities with Central und Upper German dialects in this region.

==Overseas dialects==
The dialects of German that are or were primarily spoken in colonies or communities founded by German speaking people resemble the dialects of the regions the founders came from. For example, [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]] resembles dialects of the [[Palatinate region|Palatinate]], and [[Hutterite German]] resembles dialects of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], whereas [[Venezuela]]n ''[[Colonia Tovar dialect|Alemán Coloniero]]'' is a [[Low Alemannic]] variant.

===Amana German===
{{main|Amana German}}
Amana German is a dialect of [[West Central German]]. It is spoken in the [[Amana Colonies]] in [[Iowa]], which were founded by [[Inspirationalists]] of [[Germans|German]] origin. Amana is derived from [[Hessian dialects|Hessian]], another West Central German dialect. Amana German is called ''Kolonie-Deutsch'' in Standard German.

===Brazilian German===
{{main|Brazilian German}}
In Brazil, the largest concentrations of German speakers, [[German Brazilians]], are in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], where [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] was developed, especially in the areas of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], and [[Espírito Santo]], as well as in Petrópolis ([[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]).

===Chilean German===
Lagunen-Deutsch is a variety of [[High German languages|High German]] spoken in [[Chile]].

Most speakers of Lagunen-Deutsch live around [[Lake Llanquihue]].
Lagunen-Deutsch has integrated elements of the [[Spanish language]]. This includes the integration of false cognates with the Spanish language, transferring the Spanish meanings into Lagunen-Deutsch.

The geographical origin of most or all speakers of Lagunen-Deutsch is Chile, to where the ancestors of the speakers [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|immigrated from Europe]] in the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Texas German===
{{main|Texas German}}
German was at one time the main language used in schools, churches and businesses in certain parts of [[Texas]] surrounding [[Austin]] and [[San Antonio]].&lt;ref name="TexasGerman"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22490560 German dialect in Texas is one of a kind, and dying out], 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  As of October 2013, the Texas German Dialect Project at the [[University of Texas]] is recording residual German dialect in central Texas.  The dialect is characterised by a loss of lip-rounding on the /{{IPA link|yː}}/ phoneme.&lt;ref name="TexasGerman"/&gt;

{{wiktionary|grammaticality}}

In [[theoretical linguistics]],  a speaker's judgement on the [[well-formedness]] of a linguistic [[utterance]]—called a '''grammaticality judgement'''—is based on whether the sentence is produced and interpreted in accordance with the rules and constraints of the relevant [[grammar]]. If the rules and constraints of the particular language are followed then the sentence is considered to be grammatical. In contrast, an ungrammatical sentence is one that violates the rules of the given language.

Linguists use grammaticality judgements to investigate the syntactic structure of sentences. [[Generative grammar|Generative linguists]] are largely of the opinion that for [[native speaker]]s of [[natural language]]s, grammaticality is a matter of linguistic [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], and reflects the innate linguistic competence of speakers. Therefore, generative linguistics attempts to predict grammaticality judgements exhaustively. On the other hand, for linguists who stress the role of social learning,  in contrast to innate knowledge of language, such as Hopper 1987 there has been a gradual abandonment of talk about grammaticality in favour of acceptability.&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, Paul (1987): Emergent grammar. In: Aske, Jon et al. (ed.) (1987): General session and parasession on grammar and cognition. Proceedings of the thirteenth annual meeting. Berkeley: BLS: 139–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The concept of grammaticality is closely tied to [[generative grammar]], which has the goal of generating all and only the well-formed sentences in a given language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millar|first1=Jim|title=A critical introduction to syntax|date=2011|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8264-9703-1|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0UQHXUzR9AC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria that determine grammaticality===
According to [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]], a speaker's  grammaticality judgement is based on two factors:

# A speaker's '''[[linguistic competence]]''', which is the knowledge that they have of their language, allows them to easily judge whether a sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical based on [[Intuition (psychology)|intuitive]] introspection. For this reason, such judgements are sometimes called '''introspective grammaticality judgements'''.
# The '''context''' in which the sentence was uttered.

===Criteria that don't determine grammaticality===
In his study of grammaticality in the 1950s, Chomsky identified three criteria which cannot be used to determine whether or not a sentence is grammatical.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, (1957): "Syntactic Structures", The Hague/Paris:Mouton&lt;/ref&gt;

# Whether or not the sentence is included in a [[Corpus linguistics|corpus]]
# Whether or not the sentence is meaningful
# Whether or not the sentence is statistically probable

To illustrate this point, Chomsky created the nonsensical sentence in (1), which does not occur in any corpus, is not meaningful, and is not statistically probable. However, the form of this sentence is judged to be grammatical by many native speakers of English. Such grammaticality judgements reflect the fact that the structure of sentence (1) obeys the rules of English grammar. This can be seen by comparing sentence (1) with sentence (2). Both sentences have the same structure, and both are grammatically well-formed.

[[File:Colorless green idea.png|thumb|Tree structure of "Colourless green ideas sleep furiously"]]

 (1) ''Colorless green  ideas   sleep furiously. ''(Chomsky 1957: 17)
 (2) ''Harmless  young children sleep quietly.''

A grammatical string is not necessarily meaningful, as exemplified by Chomsky's famous sentence ‘Colorless green ideas sleep furiously’. However, language speakers can still understand nonsensical strings by means of natural intonation. Speakers are able to recall them more easily than ungrammatical sentences. It is also suggested that speakers are supposed to have intuitions about grammaticality, which is determined by their competence on that language.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Siobhan, and Routledge, Christopher"&gt;Chapman, Siobhan, and Routledge, Christopher, [http://site.ebrary.com/lib/ubc/reader.action?docID=10277566 "Key Ideas in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language", 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammaticality versus acceptability==
Acceptability is the extent to which:

# a sentence is produced by the grammatical rules of that language;
# that sentence is considered permissible by speaker and hearer.

On the other hand, grammaticality is the extent to which a ‘string’ of language conforms with a set of given rules.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Siobhan, and Routledge, Christopher"/&gt;

It is assumed that a native speaker's grammar generates '''grammatical''' strings and that the speaker also has the ability to judge whether this string is '''acceptable''' in that language. In practice, the two notions are frequently confounded and speakers are typically asked to give their ‘grammaticality judgements’ instead of ‘acceptability judgements’.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Siobhan, and Routledge, Christopher"/&gt; Lyons 1968 defines grammaticality as  "that part of the acceptability of utterances which can be accounted for in terms of the rules", a criterion that complements acceptability for [[semantic]] soundness.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, John (1968): Introduction to Theoretical Linguistics. London: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|9780521095105}} .&lt;/ref&gt;  Grammaticality is defined by what a particular grammar can have as its output, while acceptability is speaker-oriented and depends upon what speakers will consider appropriate.&lt;ref name=Bauer&gt;Bauer, [http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/219/art%253A10.1007%252Fs11525-014-9234-z.pdf?auth66=1415861482_197ec68008b8402b69995e220927e3d8&amp;ext=.pdf "Grammaticality, acceptibility, possible words and large corpora", 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceptability is gradient===
However, there are still modern linguists who side with the more traditional categorical interpretation of grammaticality, such as Sprouse (2007).&lt;ref name="Sprouse" /&gt;
Speakers' judgements of the well-formedness of sentences form a continuous spectrum. While many grammaticality judgements are categorical, with a given sentence judged as either 'grammatical' or 'ungrammatical', there are many sentences that fall in a grey area of partial acceptability. According to Jon Sprouse (2007), the difference between grammaticality and acceptability is that grammatical knowledge is categorical, but acceptability is a gradient scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprouse | first1 = J | year = 2007 | title = Continuous acceptability, categorical grammaticality, and experimental syntax | url = | journal = Biolinguistics | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 123–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptability of a sentence is often reported in a variety of terms including acceptable, marginally acceptable, unacceptable, terrible, good etc. Degrees of acceptability are usually represented by symbols like *, ?,??, ?* etc., usually on a scale of 0-?-*-** (acceptable to unacceptable).

 (3) *** The Sally hugged him the Thomas
 (4) ** The Sally hugged him Thomas
 (5) * The Sally hugged Thomas
 (6) ??? Which the friend Thomas has painted a picture of?
 (7) ?? Which friend Thomas had painted a picture of?
 (8) ? Which friend has Thomas painted the picture of?

Note that examples (3)-(8) are open to interpretability as intuition of grammaticality is somewhat based on intuition so the degrees of grammaticality may range from individual to individual. Some linguists believe that the informal use of these [[diacritic]]s is problematic because the exact meaning of the symbols have never been properly defined, and their usage is riddled with inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bader | first1 = M. | last2 = Haussler | first2 = J. | year = 2010 | title = Toward a model of grammaticality judgments | url = | journal = Journal of Linguistics | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 273–330 | doi=10.1017/s0022226709990260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = John Robert | year = 1979 | title = Where’s English? | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/haj/Where'sEnglish.pdf | editor-last1 = Fillmore | editor-first1 = Charles | editor-last2 = Kempler | editor-first2 = Daniel | editor-last3 = Wang | editor-first3 = William | journal = Individual differences in language ability and language behavior | publication-place = New York | publisher = Academic Press | pages = 127–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laporte | first1 = Eric | year = 2015 | title = The Science of Linguistics | url = http://inference-review.com/article/the-science-of-linguistics | journal = Inference. International Review of Science | volume = 1 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency affects acceptability===
Acceptability is about the performance of speakers, that is, the actual use of their language in concrete situations. As stressed by Chomsky, acceptability does not mean grammaticality: while an acceptable sentence must be grammatical, a grammatical sentence does not need to be acceptable. For a sentence to be judged acceptable, it must also appear natural and appropriate in a given context, be easily understood and, possibly, be to a certain extent conventionalised.&lt;ref name=Bauer /&gt;

The two need not match, below are two examples:

[[File:Colorless green idea.png|thumb|Tree structure of "Colourless green ideas sleep furiously"]]

Grammatical but not acceptable:
 (9)  ''Colourless green ideas sleep furiously. ''(Chomsky 1957: 17)

Acceptable but not grammatical:
 (10) ''But if this ever-changing world '''in''' which we live '''in'''
      ''Makes you give in and cry''
      ''Say live and let die.'' (Paul McCartney, 1973)

Example (9) is grammatical yet unacceptable since sleeping is not something that can pragmatically be described as being done furiously. Although the syntactic structure is grammatical, the semantic meaning does not make sense according to the English lexicon.

Example (10) is not grammatical because the same preposition (''in'') is both maintained in its original position and stranded. This contravenes the rules of English which allows either the entire prepositional phrase ''in which'' to be relativized, as in (11a), or the object of the preposition which to be relativized, as in (11b). However, (11c) is acceptable because of the frequency with which people hear it.&lt;ref name=Bauer /&gt;

 (11) a.  This world ['''in''' which] we live [ __ ] ...
      b.  This world [which] we live '''in''' [ __ ] ...
      c. *This world ['''in''' which] we live '''in''' [ __ ] ...

That the relative acceptability of (11c) is related to a frequency affect is confirmed by the fact that ordinarily such sentences are judged to be ungrammatical, as shown in (12).

 (12) a.  This table ['''on''' which] I put the book [ __ ] ...
      b.  This table [which] I put the book '''on''' [ __ ] ...
      c. *This table ['''on''' which] I put the book '''on''' [ __ ] ...

===Other factors that determine acceptability===
The prevailing models on grammaticality since Chomsky (1965) postulate that the acceptability of sentences is a scale, with clearly acceptable on one side, clearly unacceptable on the other, and all manner of ranges of partial acceptability in between.&lt;ref name="Sprouse"&gt;Sprouse, [http://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/viewFile/22/8 "Continuous Acceptability, Categorical Grammaticality, and Experimental Syntax", 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in spite of this linguists since Chomsky have tended to assume that grammaticality is categorical, or [[wikt:binary|binary]], and that a sentence either is or is not grammatical, with no partial grammaticality in between. To explain the scale of partial acceptability, these linguists have said that phenomena other than [[Linguistic competence|grammatical knowledge]]—such as plausibility, working memory limitations, etc.—account for speakers reporting acceptability on a scale. However, there are a few exceptions to this trend, including those who claim that "strength of violation" plays a role in grammaticality judgements. Examples of linguists of this persuasion include Huang's (1982) proposal that ECP violations are stronger than Subjacency violations, Chomsky's (1986) proposal that each barrier crossed leads to lower acceptability, and [[Optimality Theory]] (esp. Keller 2000, 2003).&lt;ref name="Sprouse" /&gt;

 (13) Subjacency *[CP What{{sub|j}} does [ TP Sue wonder [CP when I broke ___{{sub|j}}]]]? (Sportiche 2014: 287)
 (14) Barrier *Herself{{sub|j}} likes Mary{{sub|j}}'s mother

Subjacency says that you cannot relate two positions across two bounding nodes. In (13), we see that the movement of the wh-expression 'what' was moved past a CP and a TP to get to the Spec CP position- thus this phrase is ungrammatical.

Within the past twenty years however, there has been a major shift in linguists' understanding of intermediate levels of acceptability. This is due to the increasing use of experimental methods to measure acceptability, making it possible to detect subtle differences along a scale of acceptability. Keller (2000) and Fanselow et al. (2004) are two proponents of this new way to construe grammaticality.

===Norm-based evaluation===
[[linguistic prescription|Prescriptive grammar]]s of [[controlled natural language]]s define grammaticality as a matter of explicit consensus. On this view, to consider a string as grammatical, it should conform with a set of norms. These norms are usually based on conventional rules that form a part of a higher/literary register for a given language. For some languages, these norms are defined and periodically updated by an appointed body of experts whose rulings are occasionally questioned by the frustrated members of the public.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Siobhan, and Routledge, Christopher"/&gt;

==Use of grammaticality judgments==

===Investigating sentence processing===
There are several methods that successfully investigate [[sentence processing]], some of which include [[eye tracking]], self-paced listening and reading, or [[Priming (psychology)|cross-modal priming]]. The most productive method however, is real-time grammaticality judgements. A grammaticality judgement is a test which involves showing participants sentences that are either grammatical or ungrammatical. The participant must decide whether or not they find the sentences to be grammatical as quickly as possible. Grammaticality is cross-linguistic, so this method has therefore been used on a wide variety of languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kail | first1 = M. | last2 = Lemaire | first2 = P. | last3 = Lecacheur | first3 = M. | year = 2012 | title = Online grammaticality judgments in french young and older adults | url = | journal = Experimental Aging Research | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 186–207 | doi=10.1080/0361073x.2012.660031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grammaticality judgements are largely based on an individual's linguistic intuition, and it has been pointed out that humans have the ability to understand as well as produce an infinitely large number of new sentences that have never been seen before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nagata | first1 = H | year = 1988 | title = The relativity of linguistic intuition: The effect of repetition on grammaticality judgments | url = | journal = Journal of Psycholinguistic Research | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 1–17 | doi=10.1007/bf01067178}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows us to accurately judge a sentence grammatical or ungrammatical, even if it is a completely novel sentence.

===Computer-assisted language instruction===
(Catt 1988) and (Catt and Hirst 1990) created a model of grammaticality based around a computer program developed for computer-assisted language instruction which was designed to perform automatic error diagnosis and correction of ungrammaticalities produced by second-language
learners. The program classified errors made by language-learners in their sentences as being due to errors in phrase structure, transformations, morphology, verb subcategorization, or by the languages-learners translating their primary language directly into the language they are learning. The program worked primarily by utilizing a parser which consisted of constraints which, if a first parsing attempt failed, could be selectively relaxed. Thus, for a given parse, the constraints which were relaxed indicated the precise nature and location of ungrammaticality.&lt;ref&gt;CARSON T. SCHUTZE, The Empirical Base of Linguistics, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessing first language (L1) competence===
There have been experiments conducted in order to test how early speakers gain the ability to judge grammaticality in their [[First language|native language]]. In an experiment by Cairns et al., preschool children aged 4–6 were presented sentences such as (15) and (16) orally. (To make sure that the meaning of the sentences was clear to the children, sentences were enacted with toys.) While sentence (15) is well-formed in the adult grammar, sentence (16) is not, as indicated by the [[Asterisk#Grammaticality asterisk|asterisk (*)]]. The source of the ill-formedness is that the verb ''hug'' is a transitive verb and so must have a direct object, namely something or someone who receives the action of the verb. Sentence (16) is missing the receiver of ''hug''.

 (15)  ''The kitten '''hugged''' the pig.'' [Carin 2006: 215]
 (16) *''The zebra '''hugged'''.'' [Carin 2006: 215]

The results of this study show that the earliest age at which children can discriminate well-formed from ill-formed sentences, as well as correct these, is at 6 years.&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cairns|title=Development of a Metalinguistic Skill: Judging the Grammaticality of Sentences|journal=Communication Disorders Quarterly|date=2006|page=213|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=c8h&amp;AN=2009570484&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the critical period between 4 and 6 years old, there is a significant increase in the accuracy of grammaticality judgments, since [[Metalinguistics|metalinguistic]] skill is in critical development; the judgment relies on the [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] ability of the child to access their internalized grammar and to compute whether it can or cannot generate the target sentence.&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com"/&gt; This ability to judge the grammaticality of sentences seems to develop in children well after basic [[grammar]] skills have been established, and is related to early reading acquisition—acquisitionists generally believe that the ability to make grammaticality judgments is a measure of [[Syntax|syntactic]] awareness.&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com"/&gt;

===Assessing second language (L2) competence===
Late learners of L2 perform worse on grammaticality judgment tasks or tests than native speakers or early acquirers, in that L2 learners are more likely to accept a sentence that is ungrammatical as grammatical. After the [[Critical Period Hypothesis|critical period]], age of acquisition is no longer supposed to have an effect, and native-like performance is no longer supposed to be achievable. However, the idea that there is a critical period for the acquisition of [[Syntax|syntactic]] competence, which is reflected by the ability to assess the well-formedness of a sentence, is controversial. On one view, biological or language-specific mechanisms become non-functional after a certain age. On another view, decreased [[Second-language acquisition|L2]] learning ability with age is not inevitable, and can be explained by factors such as motivation, learning environment, pressure, and time commitment. Although there is evidence that supports the claim that speakers outside the L2 mastery age range are not capable of acquiring native-like mastery of a language, there is also evidence supporting the opposite, as well as evidence for young learners not mastering an L2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDonald|first1=Janet L.|title=Grammaticality judgments in a second language: Influences of age of acquisition and native language|journal=Applied Psycholinguistics|date=2000|volume=21|pages=395–423|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FAPS%2FAPS21_03%2FS0142716400003064a.pdf&amp;code=b3f382bcf7f13be2f111c69b82140018|doi=10.1017/s0142716400003064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performance-related factors====
General processing problems, rather than a deficit in some syntax specific process or module, offer a viable explanation for populations that exhibit poor grammatical performance. Performance on L2 grammaticality judgments might be partially due to variable accessibility to and use of relevant grammatical knowledge. Difficulties in basic level [[Cognition|cognitive processing]] are due to:
* low L2 memory capacity
* poor L2 decoding ability
*  slow L2 processing speed
These issues have been tied to grammatical processing performance by testing native speakers of English on the same tasks under stressful conditions: there is shown to be difficulty in grammatical agreement when memory capacity is curtailed, important cues in the language when given noisy input, and processing important structures when not given enough time to process input. This shows that knowledge cannot always be automatically and consistently applied under stressful situations without having processing difficulties. However, these issues are not necessarily independent of each other, as low decoding ability of structure could affect processing speed. Overall, individual differences in L2 working memory and decoding ability are correlated to grammaticality judgment accuracy and latencies. However, there is no correlation between speed of processing measure and grammaticality judgment performance, age of arrival correlates with syntactic mastery, and knowledge of vocabulary probably drives grammaticality performance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDonald|first1=Janet L.|title=Beyond the critical period: Processing-based explanations for poor grammaticality judgment performance by late second language learners.|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=2006|volume=55|pages=381–401|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2006.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Age-related factors====
Age for decrease of L2 grammaticality performance varies from early childhood to late adolescence, depending on the combinations of the speaker's first and second language. The age of acquisition at which L2 learners are worse than native speakers depends on how dissimilar the [[First language|L1]] and L2 are on phonological and grammatical level. For example, Chinese/English bilinguals at 7 years old perform just as well as Spanish/English bilinguals at 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=J. S.|last2=Newport|first2=E. L.|title=Critical period effects in second language learning: The influence of maturational state on the acquisition of English as a second language.|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=1989|volume=21|pages=60–99|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(89)90003-0|pmid=2920538}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birdsong|first1=D.|last2=Molis|first2=M.|title=On the evidence for maturational constraints in second-language acquisition.|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=2001|volume=44|pages=235–249|doi=10.1006/jmla.2000.2750}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that a grammatical construction on an L2 that has a parallel structure in an L1 would impose less processing demand than one that does not have a parallel, causing a poorer performance on language structure.

There is evidence for late L2 learners generally having issues with plurals and past tense, and not so many issues with Subject-Verb-Object testing, in which they show native-like results; there is better performance on [[Yes–no question|Yes/No]] as well as [[Interrogative word|Wh-]] questions than on [[Article (grammar)|articles]] and [[past tense]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There is data supporting high-performing late learners well beyond the critical period: in an experiment testing grammaticality by J. L. McDonald, 7/50 L2 English late-learner subjects had scores within range of native speakers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The results are linked to how individual differences in L2 memory capacity, decoding, or processing speed affect processing resources to automatically apply the relevant grammatical knowledge.

{{unreferenced|date=September 2014}}'''Hearties''' was a term used for athletic students (particularly [[rower]]s) at the [[University of Oxford]] and elsewhere, especially in the 19th and early 20th century. The term is often used in contrast to the less athletic "[[aesthetes]]".

At [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in Oxford there is an ornamental pond with a statue of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] in the centre of [[Tom Quad]], the main [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]] in the college and the largest in Oxford. In the past, it was traditional for hearties to throw aesthetes into this pond as a practical joke.

In the novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' by [[Evelyn Waugh]], Anthony Blanche was "[[debagging|debagged]]" by athletic hearties at Oxford.

'''Identity politics''' are [[political]] positions based on the interests and perspectives of social groups with which people identify. Identity politics includes the ways in which people's politics are shaped by aspects of their identity through loosely{{Clarification needed|loosely or "somewhat"?|date=September 2018}} correlated social organizations. Examples include social organizations based on age, [[religion]], [[social class]] or [[caste]], [[culture]], [[dialect]], [[disability]], [[education]], [[ethnicity]], [[language]], [[nationality]], [[sex]], [[gender identity]], [[generation]], [[Job|occupation]], [[profession]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[political party]] affiliation, [[sexual orientation]], [[human settlement|settlement]], [[Urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] habitation, and [[military veteran|veteran status]].

The term "identity politics" has been in use in various forms since the 1960s or 1970s, but has been applied with, at times, radically different meanings by different populations.&lt;ref name="Wiarda-2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/|title=Identity Politics|first=Cressida|last=Heyes|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, [[Center for the Study of Language and Information|CSLI]], [[Stanford University]]| accessdate=2012-11-11|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term ''identity politics'' has been used in political discourse since at least the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Wiarda-2016"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiarda |first=Howard J. |title=Political Culture, Political Science, and Identity Politics: An Uneasy Alliance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hHtCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150 |date=8 April 2016 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |isbn=978-1-317-07885-2 |oclc=982044314 |orig-year=1st pub. [[Ashgate]]:2014 |accessdate=21 February 2018 |quote=There are disputes regarding the origins of the term 'identity politics' .... Almost all authors, even while disagreeing over who was the first to use the term, agree that its original usage goes back to the 1970s and even the 1960s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One aim of identity politics has been for those feeling oppressed by and actively suffering under systemic social inequities to articulate their suffering and felt oppression in terms of their own experience by processes of [[consciousness-raising]] and collective action. One of the older written examples of it can be found in the April 1977 statement of the [[black feminist]] group, [[Combahee River Collective]], which was subsequently reprinted in a number of anthologies,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism'', ed. Zillah R. Eisenstein (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barbara Smith]] and the Combahee River Collective have been credited with coining the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collier-Thomas|first1=edited by Bettye|last2=Franklin|first2=V.P.|title=Sisters in the struggle African American women in the civil rights-black power movement|date=2001|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-1603-2|page=39|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iR6NVzFEntgC&amp;pg=PA194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Duchess.

In the process of consciousness-raising, actually life-sharing, we began to recognize the commonality of our experiences and, from the sharing and growing consciousness, to build a politics that will change our lives and inevitably end our oppression....We realize that the only people who care enough about us to work consistently for our liberation are us. Our politics evolve from a healthy love for ourselves, our sisters and our community which allows us to continue our struggle and work. This focusing upon our own oppression is embodied in the concept of identity politics. We believe that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity, as opposed to working to end somebody else's oppression.

Identity politics, as a mode of categorizing, are closely connected to the ascription that some social groups are oppressed (such as women, [[ethnic minorities]], and [[sexual minorities]]); that is, the claim that individuals belonging to those groups are, by virtue of their identity, more vulnerable to forms of oppression such as [[cultural imperialism]], [[violence]], [[exploitation of labour]], [[marginalization]], or powerlessness.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heyes|first1=Cressida|title=Identity Politics|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=3 May 2017|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these lines of social difference can be seen as ways to gain empowerment or avenues through which to work towards a more equal society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some groups have combined identity politics and [[Marxist]] [[social class]] analysis and [[class consciousness]] — the most notable example being the [[Black Panther Party]] — but this is not necessarily characteristic of the form. Another example is [[MOVE]], members of which mixed [[black nationalism]] with [[anarcho-primitivism]] (a radical form of [[green politics]] based on the idea that civilization is an instrument of oppression, advocating the return to a [[hunter gatherer]] society).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=by Committee|title=Philadelphia Special Investigation Commission (MOVE) Records {{!}} Temple University Libraries|url=https://library.temple.edu/scrc/philadelphia-special-1|website=library.temple.edu|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=no attrib.|title=On a Move – Website of the MOVE Organization|url=http://onamove.com/|website=onamove.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identity politics can be left wing or right wing, with examples of the latter being [[Ulster Loyalism]], [[Islamism]] and [[Christian Identity]] movements.

During the 1980s, the politics of identity became very prominent and it was linked to a new wave of social movement activism.&lt;ref name='Calhoun'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Calhoun |first1=Craig |authorlink1=Craig Calhoun |chapter=Social Theory and the Politics of Identity|title=Social Theory and the Politics of Identity|editor=Craig Calhoun (Ed.) |publisher=Blackwell |year=1994 |isbn=978-1-55786-473-4}}{{page needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-2010s have seen a marked rise of identity politics, including [[White nationalism|white identity politics in the United States]].  This phenomenon is attributed to increased demographic diversity and the prospect of whites becoming a minority in America.  Such shifts have driven many to affiliate with conservative causes including those not related to diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bartels |first=Larry |date=16 April 2014 |title=Can the Republican Party thrive on white identity? |url= |newspaper=The Washington Post |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the presidential election of [[Donald Trump]], who won the support of prominent white supremacists such as [[David Duke]] and [[Richard B.

==Debates and criticism==

===Nature of the movement===
The term ''identity politics'' has been applied and misapplied retroactively to varying movements that long predate its coinage. Historian [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] discussed identity politics extensively in his 1991 book ''[[The Disuniting of America]]''.  Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of [[civil rights]], argues that a [[liberal democracy]] requires a common basis for [[culture]] and [[society]] to function. Rather than seeing civil society as already fractured along lines of power and powerless (according to race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc), Schlesinger suggests that basing politics on group marginalization is itself what fractures the civil polity, and that identity politics therefore works against creating real opportunities for ending marginalization. Schlesinger believes that "movements for civil rights should aim toward full acceptance and integration of marginalized groups into the mainstream culture, rather than...perpetuating that marginalization through affirmations of difference".&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Chaudhary &amp; Gautam Chaudhary, Global Encyclopaedia of Political Geography, New Delhi, 2009, {{ISBN|978-81-8220-233-7}}, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] has similarly suggested that identity politics causes (rather then simply recognizes and acts on) political schisms along lines of social identity. Thus, he contrasts the politics of [[gay liberation]] and identity politics by saying "... [[Peter Tatchell|[Peter] Tatchell]] also had, back in the day, ... a commitment to the politics of liberation, which encouraged gays to come out and live and engage. Now, we have the politics of identity, which invites people to stay in, to look inward, to obsess over the body and the self, to surround themselves with a moral forcefield to protect their worldview—which has nothing to do with the world—from any questioning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brendan|first1=O'Neill|title=Identity politics has created an army of vicious, narcissistic cowards|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/02/identity-politics-has-created-an-army-of-vicious-narcissists/|work=The Spectator|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these and other ways, a political perspective oriented to one's own well being can be recast as causing the divisions that it insists upon making visible.

In this same vein, author [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] argues that identity politics often marginalize the [[working class]], saying that: {{quote|In the 1950s and 1960s, left-wing intellectuals who were both inspired and informed by a powerful labour movement wrote hundreds of books and articles on working-class issues. Such work would help shape the views of politicians at the very top of the Labour Party. Today, progressive intellectuals are far more interested in issues of identity. ... Of course, the struggles for the emancipation of women, gays, and ethnic minorities are exceptionally important causes. New Labour has co-opted them, passing genuinely progressive legislation on gay equality and women's rights, for example. But it is an agenda that has happily co-existed with the sidelining of the working class in politics, allowing New Labour to protect its radical flank while pressing ahead with Thatcherite policies.|Owen Jones|''[[Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Owen|title=Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class|date=2012|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=978-1-84467-864-8|page=255|edition=updated}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[gay liberation]] movement of the late 1960s through the mid-1980s urged [[lesbian]]s and [[gay men]] to engage in radical [[direct action]], and to counter societal shame with [[gay pride]].&lt;ref name=HoffmanIntro&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first= Amy |title=An Army of Ex-Lovers: My life at the Gay Community News |year=2007 |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |isbn=978-1558496217 |pages=xi-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[feminism|feminist]] spirit of the personal being political, the most basic form of activism was an emphasis on [[coming out]] to family, friends and colleagues, and living life as an openly lesbian or [[gay]] person.&lt;ref name=HoffmanIntro/&gt; While the 1970s were the peak of "gay liberation" in New York City and other urban areas in the United States, "gay liberation" was the term still used instead of "gay pride" in more oppressive areas into the mid-1980s, with some organizations opting for the more inclusive, "lesbian and gay liberation".&lt;ref name=HoffmanIntro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoffman2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first= Amy |title=An Army of Ex-Lovers: My life at the Gay Community News |year=2007 |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |isbn=978-1558496217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While women and [[transgender]] activists had lobbied for more inclusive names from the beginning of the movement, the [[initialism]] [[LGBT]], or "[[Queer]]" as a counterculture shorthand for [[LGBT]], did not gain much acceptance as an umbrella term until much later in the 1980s, and in some areas not until the '90s or even '00s.&lt;ref name=HoffmanIntro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoffman2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hollibaugh&gt;{{cite web|author1=phoenix|title=Gay Rights Are Not Queer Liberation|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/gay-rights-are-not-queer-liberation-the-nation-interviews-amber-hollibaugh-140431/|website=autostraddle.com|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period in the United States, identity politics were largely seen in these communities in the definitions espoused by writers such as self-identified, "black, dyke, feminist, poet, mother" [[Audre Lorde]]'s [[Audre Lorde#Personal identity|view]], that [[lived experience]] matters, defines us, and is the only thing that grants authority to speak; that, "If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive."&lt;ref name=Zami&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Zami: A New Spelling of My Name]]|last=Lorde|first=Audre|publisher=Crossing Press|year=1982|isbn=978-0-89594-123-7|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kemp&gt;Kemp, Yakini B.

By the 2000s, in some areas of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[queer studies]], notably those around [[gender]], the idea of "identity politics" began to shift away from that of naming and claiming lived experience, and authority arising from lived experience, to one emphasizing choice and performance.&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Queer Theory and the Social Construction of Sexuality|work=Homosexuality|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=15 November 2011|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/homosexuality/#QueTheSocConSex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some who draw on the work of authors like [[Judith Butler]], stress the importance of not assuming an already existing identity, but of remaking and unmaking identities through "performance".&lt;ref name=ButlerPerformative&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|last = Butler|first = Judith|date = 1988 |journal = Theatre Journal |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=519–531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers in the field of [[Queer theory]] have at times taken this to the extent as to now argue that "queer", despite generations of specific use, no longer needs to refer to any specific sexual orientation at all; that it is now only about disrupting the mainstream, with author [[David M. Halperin]] arguing that straight people may now also self-identify as "queer,"&lt;ref name=Halperin&gt;{{cite book |author=Halperin, David M. |title=[[One Hundred Years of Homosexuality]]: And Other Essays on Greek Love |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=0-415-90097-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some believe, is a form of [[cultural appropriation]] which robs gays and lesbians of their identity and makes invisible and irrelevant the actual, lived experience that causes them to be marginalized in the first place.

New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia /&gt;

There are also supporters of identity politics who have developed their stances on the basis of [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]'s work (namely, "Can the Subaltern Speak?") and have described some forms of identity politics as [[strategic essentialism]], a form which has sought to work with [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] discourses to reform the understanding of "universal" goals.&lt;ref name=Spivak&gt;{{Cite book|title=Other Asias|last=Spivak|first=Gayatri Chakrovotry|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1405102070|location=Malden, M.A.|pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abraham&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abraham|first=Susan|year=2009|title=Strategic Essentialism in Nationalist Discourses: Sketching a Feminist Agenda in the Study of Religion|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/266799|journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|volume=25| issue = 1|pages=156–161|via=Project Muse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ritze&gt;G.

===Critiques of identity politics===
[[File:Anti-capitalism color— Restored.png|right|thumb|The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] poster "[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]]" (1911)]]
Some critics argue that groups based on a particular shared identity (e.g. race, or gender identity) can divert energy and attention from more fundamental issues, similar to the history of [[divide and rule]] strategies. Sociologist [[Charles Derber]] asserts that the American left is "largely an identity-politics party" and that it "offers no broad critique of the political economy of capitalism. It focuses on reforms for blacks and women and so forth. But it doesn’t offer a contextual analysis within capitalism." Both he and [[David North (socialist)|David North]] of the [[Socialist Equality Party (United States)|Socialist Equality Party]] posit that these fragmented and isolated identity movements which permeate the left have allowed for a far-right resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hedges |first=Chris |date=5 February 2018 |title=The Bankruptcy of the American Left|url=https://www.truthdig.com/articles/bankruptcy-american-left/|work=Truthdig |location= |access-date=9 February 2018|authorlink= Chris Hedges}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critiques of identity politics have also been expressed on other grounds by writers such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]],&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm, Eric (2 May 1996). "[http://banmarchive.org.uk/articles/1996%20annual%20lecture.htm Identity Politics and the Left]". 1996 Trust Lecture. Barry Amiel&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; Norman Melburn Trust. amielandmelburn.org.uk.

Hence, Hobsbawm argues that identity politics, such as [[queer nationalism]], [[Islamism]], [[Cornish nationalism]] or [[Ulster Loyalism]] are just other versions of [[bourgeois nationalism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The view that identity politics rooted in challenging racism, sexism, and the like actually obscures class inequality is widespread in the United States and many other Western nations; however, this framing ignores how class-based politics are identity politics themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/18/class-and-identity-politics-are-not-mutually-exclusive-the-left-should-use-this-to-its-benefit|title=Class and identity politics are not mutually exclusive.

=== Intersectional critiques ===
In her journal article ''Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence against Women of Color,'' [[Kimberle Crenshaw]] treats identity politics as a process that brings people together based on a shared aspect of their identity. Crenshaw applauds identity politics for bringing African Americans (and other non-white people), gays and lesbians, and other oppressed groups together in community and progress.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|author-link=Kimberle Crenshaw|date=1 January 1991|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color|jstor=1229039|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1241–99|doi=10.2307/1229039}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Crenshaw also points out that frequently groups come together based on a shared political identity but then fail to examine differences among themselves within their own group: "The problem with identity politics is not that it fails to transcend differences, as some critics charge, but rather the opposite—that it frequently conflates or ignores intragroup differences."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Crenshaw argues that when society thinks "black", they think black&amp;nbsp;''male'', and when society thinks feminism, they think&amp;nbsp;''white''&amp;nbsp;woman. When considering black women, at least two aspects of their identity are the subject of oppression: their race and their sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|publisher=University of Chicago Legal Forum|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=139–68.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crenshaw proposes instead that identity politics are useful but that we must be aware of&amp;nbsp;[[intersectionality]]&amp;nbsp;and the role it plays in identity politics. Nira Yuval-Davis supports Crenshaw's critiques&amp;nbsp;in ''Intersectionality and Feminist Politics''&amp;nbsp;and explains that "Identities are individual and collective narratives that answer the question 'who am/are I/we?"&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuval-Davis|first=Nira|date=1 August 2006|title=Intersectionality and Feminist Politics|url=http://ejw.sagepub.com/content/13/3/193|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=193–209|doi=10.1177/1350506806065752|issn=1350-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her journal article &amp;nbsp;''Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence against Women of Color'', Crenshaw provides the example of the&amp;nbsp;[[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]]/[[Anita Hill]]&amp;nbsp;controversy to expand on her point. Anita Hill came forward and accused Supreme Court Justice Nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment; Clarence Thomas would be the second African American to serve on the Supreme Court. Crenshaw argues that when Anita Hill came forward she was deemed anti-black in the movement against racism, and though she came forward on the feminist issue of sexual harassment, she was excluded because when considering feminism, it is the narrative of white middle-class women that prevails.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Crenshaw concludes that acknowledging intersecting categories when groups unite on the basis of identity politics is better than ignoring categories altogether.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A ''[[Le Monde]]''/''[[IFOP]]'' poll in January 2011 conducted in France and Germany found that a majority felt Muslims are ‘‘scattered improperly’’; an analyst for ''IFOP'' said the results indicated something ‘‘beyond linking immigration with security or immigration with unemployment, to linking Islam with a threat to identity’’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = European poll: An Islamic threat? | date = 6 Jan 2011 | url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/01/201116112228783789.html | work = [[Al Jazeera]] | accessdate = 2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Garvida Flores''' (December 9, 1900 – August 12, 1944) was an Ilocano poet and playwright, from [[Bangui, Ilocos Norte]], [[Philippines]]. His works include ''Wayawaya ken Sabsabali a Dandaniw'' (Liberty and a Collection of Poems), ''Pitik Ti Puso'' (Heartbeat), ''Kaanunto'' (When Will It Be), ''Tanda Ti Ayanayat'' (In Remembrance of Love), and plays such as ''Dagiti Ayanayat ni Dr. Jose Rizal'' (The Many Loves of Dr. José Rizal), and ''Ayat Iti Ili ken Dadduma Pay a Drama'' (Love of Country and Other Dramas).

His articles were not only written in [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] (''Bannawag''* and ''Ti Bagnos''*), but also in English (''The Tribune''), and in Spanish (''La Lucha''* and ''El Norte''*), etc. He was also editor-in-chief of ''Dangadang''*, another Ilocano newspaper, which he published together with Santiago S. Fonacier.

'''Kharam''' ('''Kharam Naga''') is a [[Kuki-Chin languages|Kuki-Chin language]] of India. However, speakers consider themselves to be ethnic [[Naga people]], rather than part of the Kuki and Chin ethnic groups. Peterson (2017)&lt;ref name="Peterson2017"&gt;Peterson, David. 2017.

Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; classifies the closely related [[Purum language]] (and hence Kharam as well) as part of the ''Northwestern'' branch of Kuki-Chin. According ''Ethnologue'', Kharam shares a high degree of mutual intelligibility with [[Purum language|Purum]].

==Geographical distribution==
Kharam Naga is spoken in the following locations of [[Manipur]] (''[[Ethnologue]]'').

The '''larynx''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|ɹ|ɪ|ŋ|k|s}}), commonly called the '''voice box''', is an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] in the top of the [[neck]] of [[tetrapod]]s involved in breathing, producing sound, and protecting the [[trachea]] against food aspiration. The larynx houses the [[vocal folds]], and manipulates [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[sound pressure|volume]], which is essential for [[phonation]]. It is situated just below where the tract of the [[pharynx]] splits into the trachea and the [[esophagus]]. The word larynx (plural larynges) comes from a similar [[Ancient Greek]] word (λάρυγξ ''lárynx'').&lt;ref name=etymology&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=larynx|title=''Larynx'' Etymology|publisher=''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
===Location===
In adult humans, the larynx is found in the [[anterior]] neck at the level of the C3–C7 [[vertebrae]]. It connects the inferior part of the [[pharynx]] (hypopharynx) with the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. The laryngeal [[skeleton]] consists of six [[cartilage]]s: three single ([[Epiglottic cartilage|epiglottic]], [[thyroid cartilage|thyroid]] and [[Cricoid cartilage|cricoid]]) and three paired ([[Arytenoid cartilage|arytenoid]], [[corniculate cartilages|corniculate]], and [[Cuneiform cartilages|cuneiform]]). The [[hyoid bone]] is not part of the larynx, though the larynx is suspended from the hyoid. The larynx extends vertically from the tip of the [[epiglottis]] to the inferior border of the [[cricoid cartilage]]. Its interior can be divided in supraglottis, [[glottis]] and [[subglottis]].
[[File:Illu07 larynx02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Vocal cords abducted and adducted]]
[[File:Illu larynx.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Basic parts of the human larynx]]

===Cartilages===
{{Double image|right|Gray950.png|150|Gray958.png|150|Posterior view of the larynx; disarticulated cartilages (left) and intrinsic muscles (right)}}
There are six cartilages, three unpaired and three paired, that support the mammalian larynx and form its skeleton.

Unpaired cartilages:
* [[Thyroid cartilage]]: This forms the [[Adam's apple]]. It is usually larger in males than in females. The [[thyrohyoid membrane]] is a ligament associated with the thyroid cartilage that connects the thyroid cartilage with the hyoid bone.
* [[Cricoid cartilage]]: A ring of hyaline cartilage that forms the inferior wall of the larynx. It is attached to the top of the trachea. The [[median cricothyroid ligament]] connects the cricoid cartilage to the thyroid cartilage.
* [[Epiglottis]]: A large, spoon-shaped piece of elastic cartilage. During [[swallowing]], the pharynx and larynx rise. Elevation of the pharynx widens it to receive food and drink; elevation of the larynx causes the epiglottis to move down and form a lid over the glottis, closing it off.
Paired cartilages:
* [[Arytenoid cartilage]]s: Of the paired cartilages, the arytenoid cartilages are the most important because they influence the position and tension of the [[vocal cords|vocal folds]]. These are triangular pieces of mostly hyaline cartilage located at the posterosuperior border of the cricoid cartilage.
* [[Corniculate cartilages]]: Horn-shaped pieces of elastic cartilage located at the apex of each arytenoid cartilage.
* [[Cuneiform cartilages]]: Club-shaped pieces of elastic cartilage located anterior to the corniculate cartilages.

===Muscles===
The muscles of the larynx are divided into ''intrinsic'' and ''extrinsic'' muscles.

The intrinsic muscles are divided into respiratory and the phonatory muscles (the muscles of [[phonation]]). The respiratory muscles move the [[vocal cord]]s apart and serve breathing. The phonatory muscles move the vocal cords together and serve the production of voice. The extrinsic, passing between the larynx and parts around; and intrinsic, confined entirely. The main respiratory muscles are the [[posterior cricoarytenoid muscle]]s. The phonatory muscles are divided into adductors ([[lateral cricoarytenoid muscle]]s, [[arytenoid muscle]]s) and tensors ([[cricothyroid muscle]]s, [[thyroarytenoid muscle]]s).

====Intrinsic====
The intrinsic laryngeal muscles are responsible for controlling sound production.
* [[Cricothyroid muscle]] lengthen and tense the vocal folds.
* [[Posterior cricoarytenoid muscle]]s abduct and externally rotate the arytenoid cartilages, resulting in abducted vocal folds.
* [[Lateral cricoarytenoid muscle]]s adduct and internally rotate the arytenoid cartilages, increase medial compression.
* [[Transverse arytenoid muscle]] adduct the arytenoid cartilages, resulting in adducted vocal folds.&lt;ref&gt;Collectively, the transverse and oblique arytenoids are known as the interarytenoids.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oblique arytenoid muscle]]s narrow the laryngeal inlet by constricting the distance between the arytenoid cartilages.
* [[Thyroarytenoid muscles]] – sphincter of vestibule, narrowing the laryngeal inlet, shortening the vocal folds, and lowering voice pitch. The internal thyroarytenoid is the portion of the thyroarytenoid that vibrates to produce sound.

Notably the only muscle capable of separating the vocal cords for normal breathing is the posterior cricoarytenoid.  If this muscle is incapacitated on both sides, the inability to pull the vocal folds apart (abduct) will cause difficulty breathing.  Bilateral injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve would cause this condition.  It is also worth noting that all muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus except the cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (a branch of the vagus).

Additionally, intrinsic laryngeal muscles present a constitutive [[Calcium buffering|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-buffering]] profile that predicts their better ability to handle calcium changes in comparison to other muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 4510619 | pmid=26109185 | doi=10.14814/phy2.12409 | volume=3 | title=Expression of calcium-buffering proteins in rat intrinsic laryngeal muscles | year=2015 | journal=Physiol Rep | last1 = Ferretti | first1 = R | last2 = Marques | first2 = MJ | last3 = Khurana | first3 = TS | last4 = Santo Neto | first4 = H | page=e12409}}&lt;/ref&gt; This profile is in agreement with their function as very fast muscles with a well-developed capacity for prolonged work. Studies suggests that mechanisms involved in the prompt sequestering of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-reuptake proteins, plasma membrane pumps, and cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-buffering proteins) are particularly elevated in laryngeal muscles, indicating their importance for the myofiber function and protection against disease, such as [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]].&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/mus.20697 | volume=35 | title=Intrinsic laryngeal muscles are spared from myonecrosis in themdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy | journal=Muscle | pages=349–353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, differential levels of Orai1 in rat intrinsic laryngeal muscles and [[extraocular muscle]]s over the limb muscle suggests a role for store operated [[Calcium channel|calcium entry channels]] in those muscles' functional properties and signaling mechanisms.

====Extrinsic====
The extrinsic laryngeal muscles support and position the larynx within the mid-cervical region.  [trachea.]
[[File:Gray386.png|thumb|Extrinsic laryngeal muscles]]
* [[Sternothyroid muscle]]s depress the larynx.
* [[Omohyoid muscle]]s depress the larynx.
* [[Sternohyoid muscle]]s depress the larynx.
* [[Inferior constrictor muscle]]s
* [[Thyrohyoid muscle]]s elevates the larynx.
* [[Digastric]] elevates the larynx.
* [[Stylohyoid]] elevates the larynx.
* [[Mylohyoid muscle|Mylohyoid]] elevates the larynx.
* [[Geniohyoid]] elevates the larynx.
* [[Hyoglossus]] elevates the larynx.
* [[Genioglossus]] elevates the larynx

===Nerve supply===
The larynx is [[innervate]]d by branches of the [[vagus nerve]] on each side. Sensory innervation to the glottis and laryngeal vestibule is by the internal branch of the [[superior laryngeal nerve]]. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve innervates the [[cricothyroid muscle]].  Motor innervation to all other muscles of the larynx and sensory innervation to the subglottis is by the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]]. While the sensory input described above is (general) visceral sensation (diffuse, poorly localized), the vocal fold also receives general somatic sensory innervation (proprioceptive and touch) by the superior laryngeal nerve.

Injury to the external laryngeal nerve causes weakened phonation because the vocal folds cannot be tightened. Injury to one of the recurrent laryngeal nerves produces [[hoarseness]], if both are damaged the voice may or may not be preserved, but breathing becomes difficult.

===Development===
In newborn infants, the larynx is initially at the level of the C2–C3 vertebrae, and is further forward and higher relative to its position in the adult body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utmb.edu/otoref/grnds/Reflux-Aspiration-050223/GERD-pedi-050223.htm |title=GERD and aspiration in the child: diagnosis and treatment |date=February 23, 2005 |work=Grand Rounds Presentation |publisher=UTMB Dept. of Otolaryngology |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larynx descends as the child grows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Laitman|Reidenberg|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Laitman|Noden|Van De Water|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

===Sound generation===
Sound is generated in the larynx, and that is where [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[loudness|volume]] are manipulated. The strength of [[exhalation|expiration]] from the lungs also contributes to loudness.

Manipulation of the larynx is used to generate a source sound with a particular fundamental frequency, or pitch.  This source sound is altered as it travels through the [[vocal tract]], configured differently based on the position of the [[tongue]], [[lip]]s, [[mouth]], and [[pharynx]].  The process of altering a source sound as it passes through the filter of the vocal tract creates the many different vowel and consonant sounds of the world's languages as well as tone, certain realizations of stress and other types of linguistic prosody. The larynx also has a similar function to the lungs in creating pressure differences required for sound production; a constricted larynx can be raised or lowered affecting the volume of the oral cavity as necessary in glottalic consonants.

The vocal folds can be held close together (by adducting the arytenoid cartilages) so that they vibrate (see [[phonation]]). The muscles attached to the arytenoid cartilages control the degree of opening. Vocal fold length and tension can be controlled by rocking the [[thyroid cartilage]] forward and backward on the [[cricoid cartilage]] (either directly by contracting the cricothyroids or indirectly by changing the vertical position of the larynx), by manipulating the tension of the muscles within the vocal folds, and by moving the arytenoids forward or backward. This causes the pitch produced during [[phonation]] to rise or fall. In most males the vocal folds are longer and with a greater mass than most females' vocal folds, producing a lower pitch.

The vocal apparatus consists of two pairs of mucosal folds. These folds are false vocal folds ([[vestibular folds]]) and true vocal folds (folds). The false vocal folds are covered by respiratory epithelium, while the true vocal folds are covered by stratified squamous epithelium. The false vocal folds are not responsible for sound production, but rather for resonance. The exceptions to this are found in [[Tibetan Chant]] and Kargyraa, a style of [[Tuvan throat singing]]. Both make use of the false vocal folds to create an undertone. These false vocal folds do not contain muscle, while the true vocal folds do have skeletal muscle.

===Other===
[[File:Normal Epiglottis.jpg|thumb|Image of endoscopy]]
The most important role of the larynx is its protecting function; the prevention of foreign objects from entering the lungs by [[coughing]] and other reflexive actions.  A cough is initiated by a deep inhalation through the vocal folds, followed by the elevation of the larynx and the tight adduction (closing) of the vocal folds.  The forced expiration that follows, assisted by tissue recoil and the muscles of expiration, blows the vocal folds apart, and the high pressure expels the irritating object out of the throat.  Throat clearing is less violent than coughing, but is a similar increased respiratory effort countered by the tightening of the laryngeal musculature.  Both coughing and throat clearing are predictable and necessary actions because they clear the respiratory passageway, but both place the vocal folds under significant strain.&lt;ref name="Seikel-etal-2010-223"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Seikel|King|Drumright|2010|loc=Nonspeech laryngeal function, pp. 223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important role of the larynx is abdominal fixation, a kind of [[Valsalva maneuver]] in which the lungs are filled with air in order to stiffen the thorax so that forces applied for lifting can be translated down to the legs.  This is achieved by a deep inhalation followed by the adduction of the vocal folds.  Grunting while lifting heavy objects is the result of some air escaping through the adducted vocal folds ready for [[phonation]].&lt;ref name="Seikel-etal-2010-223" /&gt;

Abduction of the vocal folds is important during physical exertion.  The vocal folds are separated by about {{Convert|8|mm|abbr=on}} during normal respiration, but this width is doubled during forced respiration.&lt;ref name="Seikel-etal-2010-223" /&gt;

During [[swallowing]], elevation of the posterior portion of the tongue levers (inverts) the epiglottis over the glottis' opening to prevent swallowed material from entering the larynx which leads to the [[lung]]s, and provides a path for a food or liquid bolus to "slide" into the esophagus; the hyo-laryngeal complex is also pulled upwards to assist this process. Stimulation of the larynx by aspirated food or liquid produces a strong [[cough]] [[reflex]] to protect the lungs.

In addition,  intrinsic laryngeal muscles are spared from some muscle wasting disorders, such as [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]],  may facilitate the development of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in a variety of clinical scenarios. ILM have a calcium regulation system profile suggestive of a better ability to handle calcium changes in comparison to other muscles, and this may provide a mechanistic insight for their unique pathophysiological properties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.14814/phy2.12409 | pmid=26109185 | pmc=4510619 | volume=3 | title=Expression of calcium-buffering proteins in rat intrinsic laryngeal muscles | year=2015 | journal=Physiol Rep | last1 = Ferretti | first1 = R | last2 = Marques | first2 = MJ | last3 = Khurana | first3 = TS | last4 = Santo Neto | first4 = H | page=e12409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==

===Disorders===
[[File:Larynx endo 3.jpg|thumb|[[Endoscopic]] image of an inflamed human larynx]]
There are several things that can cause a larynx to not function properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Laitman|Reidenberg|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some symptoms are hoarseness, loss of voice, pain in the throat or ears, and breathing difficulties. Larynx [[Organ transplant|transplant]] is a rare procedure. The world's first successful operation took place in 1998 at the [[Cleveland Clinic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rare transplant gives California woman a voice for the first time in a decade|url=http://nonotesinging.com/woman-talks-receiving-larynx-transplant/|first=Brenda|last=Jensen|date=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second took place in October 2010 at the University of California Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Avery|title=Woman Finds Her Voice After Rare Transplant|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704881304576093980834273812|accessdate=4 September 2012|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Acute laryngitis]] is the sudden inflammation and swelling of the larynx. It is caused by the common cold or by excessive shouting. It is not serious. [[Chronic laryngitis]] is caused by smoking, dust, frequent yelling, or prolonged exposure to polluted air. It is much more serious than acute laryngitis.
* [[Presbylarynx]] is a condition in which age-related atrophy of the soft tissues of the larynx results in weak voice and restricted vocal range and stamina. Bowing of the anterior portion of the vocal folds is found on laryngoscopy.
* [[Peptic ulcer|Ulcers]] may be caused by the prolonged presence of an [[endotracheal tube]].
* [[Polyp (medicine)|Polyps]] and [[vocal fold nodule|nodules]] are small bumps on the [[Vocal cords|vocal folds]] caused by prolonged exposure to [[cigarette]] smoke and vocal misuse, respectively.
* Two related types of [[cancer of the larynx]], namely [[squamous cell carcinoma]] and [[verrucous carcinoma]], are strongly associated with repeated exposure to cigarette smoke and alcohol.
* [[Vocal cord paresis]] is weakness of one or both vocal folds that can greatly impact daily life.
* Idiopathic [[Laryngospasm|laryngeal spasm]].
* [[Laryngopharyngeal reflux]] is a condition in which acid from the stomach irritates and burns the larynx. Similar damage can occur with [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Laitman|Reidenberg|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Lipan|Reidenberg|Laitman|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Laryngomalacia]] is a very common condition of infancy, in which the soft, immature cartilage of the upper larynx collapses inward during inhalation, causing airway obstruction.
* [[Laryngeal perichondritis]], the inflammation of the [[perichondrium]] of laryngeal cartilages, causing airway obstruction.
* [[Laryngeal paralysis]] is a condition seen in some mammals (including [[dog]]s) in which the larynx no longer opens as wide as required for the passage of air, and impedes [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. In mild cases it can lead to exaggerated or "raspy" breathing or [[Thermoregulation|panting]], and in serious cases can pose a considerable need for treatment.
* [[Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy]], intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILM) are spared from the lack of [[dystrophin]] and may serve as a useful model to study the mechanisms of muscle sparing in [[neuromuscular disease]]s.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt; Dystrophic ILM presented a significant increase in the expression of [[calcium-binding proteins]]. The increase of calcium-binding proteins in dystrophic ILM may permit better maintenance of calcium homeostasis, with the consequent absence of [[myonecrosis]]. The results further support the concept that abnormal calcium buffering is involved in these neuromuscular diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/mus.21154 | volume=39 | title=Sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic-reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and calsequestrin are overexpressed in spared intrinsic laryngeal muscles of dystrophin-deficientmdxmice | journal=Muscle &amp; Nerve | pages=609–615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneering work on the structure and evolution of the larynx was carried out in the 1920s by the British comparative anatomist [[Victor Negus]], culminating in his monumental work ''The Mechanism of the Larynx'' (1929). Negus, however, pointed out that the descent of the larynx reflected the reshaping and descent of the human tongue into the pharynx. This process is not complete until age six to eight years. Some researchers, such as [[Philip Lieberman]], [[Dennis Klatt]], [[Brant de Boer]] and [[Kenneth Stevens]] using computer-modeling techniques have suggested that the species-specific human tongue allows the vocal tract (the airway above the larynx) to assume the shapes necessary to produce speech sounds that enhance the robustness of human speech. Sounds such as the vowels of the words see and do, [i] and [u], (in phonetic notation) have been shown to be less subject to confusion in classic studies such as the 1950 Peterson and Barney investigation of the possibilities for computerized speech recognition.&lt;ref name="Lieberman"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Lieberman|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, though other species have low larynges, their tongues remain anchored in their mouths and their vocal tracts cannot produce the range of speech sounds of humans. The ability to lower the larynx transiently in some species extends the length of their vocal tract, which as Fitch showed creates the acoustic illusion that they are larger. Research at Haskins Laboratories in the 1960s showed that speech allows humans to achieve a vocal communication rate that exceeds the fusion frequency of the auditory system by fusing sounds together into syllables and words. The additional speech sounds that the human tongue enables us to produce, particularly [i], allow humans to unconsciously infer the length of the vocal tract of the person who is talking, a critical element in recovering the [[phoneme]]s that make up a word.&lt;ref name="Lieberman" /&gt;

===Non-mammals===
Most [[tetrapod]] species possess a larynx, but its structure is typically simpler than that found in mammals. The cartilages surrounding the larynx are apparently a remnant of the original [[gill arch]]es in fish, and are a common feature, but not all are always present. For example, the thyroid cartilage is found only in mammals. Similarly, only mammals possess a true [[epiglottis]], although a flap of non-cartilagenous [[mucosa]] is found in a similar position in many other groups. In modern amphibians, the laryngeal skeleton is considerably reduced; [[frog]]s have only the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages, while [[salamander]]s possess only the arytenoids.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Romer|Parsons|1977|pp=214–215, 336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocal folds are found only in mammals, and a few [[lizard]]s. As a result, many reptiles and amphibians are essentially voiceless; frogs use ridges in the trachea to modulate sound, while [[bird]]s have a separate sound-producing organ, the [[Syrinx (biology)|syrinx]].&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

==History==
The ancient Greek physician [[Galen]] first described the larynx, describing it as the "first and supremely most important instrument of the voice"&lt;ref name=HYDMAN2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Hydman|first=Jonas|title=Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury|year=2008|location=Stockholm|isbn=978-91-7409-123-6|pp=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mpra''', or '''Mpre''', is an extinct language spoken in the village of [[Butei]] ({{coord|8|52|N|1|15|W|region:GH_type:landmark}}) in central [[Ghana]], located between the towns of [[Techiman]] and [[Tamale, Ghana|Tamale]] near the confluence of the [[Black Volta|Black]] and [[White Volta]]s. Mpra has been difficult to classify due to its divergent vocabulary. It is known only from a 70-word list given in a 1931 article. Blench (2007) considers it to be a possible [[language isolate]].&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger (2007) ''[http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/projets/clhass/PageWeb/ressources/Isolats/Mpra%20%20Blench%202007.pdf Recovering data on Mpra &amp;#91;=Mpre&amp;#93; a possible language isolate in North-Central Ghana]''&lt;/ref&gt; A poorly attested language spoken in the nearby village of Tuluwe, [[Mpur language (Ghana)|Mpur]], may also turn out to be yet another language isolate. Both Butie and Tuluwe are located near the village of Mpaha.

Painter (1967) briefly states that "{{IPA|ḿpŕ̩ɛ̀}} has died" and that the ethnic group ("the Nnyamase-'''mprɛ'''") have "become Nnyamase-Gonja"; he appears to regard it as having been a dialect of [[Gonja language|Gonja]]. However, this is based only on the numerals, which are clearly related to Gonja. The rest of the vocabulary is "hard to recognise" (Williamson &amp; Blench, 2000:36). Blench (2010) presents it as a possible [[Kwa language]]; Blench (2012) notes that it "may either be an isolate with [Kwa] borrowings or a highly divergent branch of Kwa".&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/General/Niger-Congo%20an%20alternative%20view.pdf Niger-Congo: an alternative view]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1673">'''Mum's the word''' is a popular [[English language|English]] [[idiom]]. It is related to an expression used by [[William Shakespeare]], in ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online-literature.com/view.php/henryVI2/3?term=mum|title="Henry Act VI Part 2"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word “mum” is a slanged version of momme, which was used between 1350-1400 in Middle English with very close to the same meaning:  Be silent; Do not reveal

== Meaning ==

"Mum's the word" means to keep silent or quiet.

''Mum'' is a [[Middle English]] word meaning 'silent',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mum"|title="mum"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be derived from the ''mummer'' who acts without speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/251850.html|title="Definition of Phrases"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Note the similar English word "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mime mime]" ([[Old English]] "mīma", Latin "mimus") meaning [[silent actor]] or imitator.

== Origin ==

The origins of the phrase can be traced back to the fourteenth century and [[William Langland|William Langland's]] narrative poem, ''[[Piers Plowman]]'':{{quote|Thou mightest beter meten the myst on Malverne hulles&lt;br/&gt;Then geten a mom of heore mouth til moneye weore schewed!}}

It can also be seen in popular fifteenth-century [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Towneley Plays]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Though thi lyppis be stokyn, yit myght thou say 'mum'.}}

The phrase notably appears in Shakespeare's ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'', Act 1, Scene 2:{{quote|Seal up your lips and give no words but mum.}}

'''Northern Ndebele''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ɛ|n|d|ə|'|b|iː|l|iː}}), also called '''Ndebele''', '''isiNdebele''', '''Zimbabwean Ndebele'''&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; or '''North Ndebele''',&lt;ref name="ISO 639-2/RA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/langcodes_name.php?code_ID=319 |title=Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: nde |publisher=ISO 639-2 Registration Authority - Library of Congress |access-date=2017-07-04 |quote=Name: North Ndebele |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051225/http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/langcodes_name.php?code_ID=319 |archivedate=2017-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO 639-3/RA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=nde |title=Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: nde |publisher=ISO 639-3 Registration Authority - SIL International |access-date=2017-07-04 |quote=Name: North Ndebele |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101121928/http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=nde |archivedate=2017-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and formerly known as '''Matabele''', is an African language belonging to the [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] group of [[Bantu languages]], spoken by the [[Northern Ndebele people]], or Matabele, of [[Zimbabwe]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernndebele.blogspot.com www.northernndebele.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Northern Ndebele is related to the [[Zulu language]], spoken in [[South Africa]]. This is because the Northern Ndebele people of Zimbabwe descend from followers of the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] leader [[Mzilikazi]] (one of Zulu king [[Shaka|Shaka's]] generals), who left the [[Zulu Kingdom]] in the early 19th century, during the [[Mfecane]], arriving in present-day Zimbabwe in 1839.

Although there are some differences in grammar, lexicon and intonation between Zulu and Northern Ndebele, the two languages share more than 85% of their lexicon &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernndebele.blogspot.com www.northernndebele.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;. To prominent Nguni linguists like Anthony Cope and Cyril Nyembezi, Northern Ndebele is a dialect of Zulu. To others like Langa Khumalo, it is a language. [[Dialect#Dialect or language|Distinguishing between a language and a dialect]] for language varieties that are very similar is difficult, with the decision often being based not on linguistic but political criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Langa Khumalo, “Language Contact and Lexical Change: A Lexicographical Terminographical Interface in Zimbabwean Ndebele,” Lexikos 14, no. 108 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cope, “A Consolidated Classification of the Bantu Languages,” African Studies 30, nos. 3–4 1971): 213–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.L.S. Nyembezi, 1957. Learn Zulu, Cape Town: Shuter &amp; SHooter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.K. Rycroft “Ndebele and Zulu: Some Phonetic and Tonal Comparisons,” Zambezia, no. 2 (1980): 109–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern Ndebele and [[Southern Ndebele language|Southern Ndebele]] (or Transvaal Ndebele), which is spoken in South Africa, are separate but related languages with some degree of [[mutual intelligibility]], although the former is more closely related to Zulu. Southern Ndebele, while maintaining its Nguni roots, has been influenced by the [[Sotho–Tswana languages|Sotho languages]].&lt;ref name="Skhosana 2009 ch 3"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/28563/Complete.pdf?sequence=8 | title=The Linguistic Relationship between Southern and Northern Ndebele | author=Skhosana, Philemon Buti | year=2009 | chapter=3 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033501/http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/28563/Complete.pdf?sequence=8 | archivedate=2015-11-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Ndebele grammar is similar to that of [[Zulu language|Zulu]], with some distinct differences such as in words with a "tsh-" in isiNdebele but a "sh-" in isiZulu &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernndebele.blogspot.com www.northernndebele.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;. Northern Ndebele is a Nguni language and is to some extent also mutually intelligible with Xhosa, the predominant language in the Eastern Cape.

Many consonant sounds may result in depressed (or breathy) allophones. Alveolar consonants, ''t'', ''d'', and ''n'', may have dentalized allophones of {{IPA|[t̪ʼ, d̪, n̪]}}. Consonants ''k'' and ''h'' can result in allophones of {{IPA|[ɣ, ɣʱ]}} and {{IPA|[ɦ]}}.

===Vowels===

There are seven vowel phonemes, written with the letters ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u''.

* ''a'' is pronounced {{IPA|[a]}}, approximately like ''a'' in father; e.g. '''abantwana''' (children)
* ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ɛ]}} or {{IPA|[e]}}, sometimes like ''e'' in bed; e.g. '''emoyeni''' (in the air)
* ''i'' is pronounced {{IPA|[i]}}, like ''ee'' in see; e.g. '''siza''' (help)
* ''o'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ɔ]}} or {{IPA|[o]}}, sometimes approximately like ''o'' in bone; e.g. '''okhokho''' (ancestors)
* ''u'' is pronounced {{IPA|[u]}}, like ''oo'' in soon; e.g. '''umuntu''' (person)

===Click consonants===

In Northern Ndebele, there are three [[click consonant]]s '''''c''''', '''''q''''' and '''''x'''''.

'''''c''''' {{IPA|[ǀ]}} is made by placing the tip of the tongue against the front upper teeth and gums, the centre of the tongue is depressed and the tip of the tongue is drawn backwards. The resulting sound is similar to the sound used in English to express annoyance.&lt;ref name="Shenk"&gt;Shenk, J.R. ''A New Ndebele Grammar''&lt;/ref&gt;
Some examples are '''cina''' (end), '''cela''' (ask)

The '''''q''''' {{IPA|[!]}} sound is made by raising the back of the tongue to touch the soft palate and touching the gums with the sides and tip of the tongue. The centre of the tongue is depressed and the tip drawn quickly away from the gum. The resulting sound is like the "pop" heard when quickly removing the cork from a bottle.&lt;ref name="Shenk" /&gt;
Some examples are '''qalisa''' (start), '''qeda''' (finish)

The '''''x''''' {{IPA|[ǁ]}} sound is made by placing the tongue so that the back of the tongue touches the soft palate and the sides and tip of the tongue touch the gums. One side of the tongue is quickly withdrawn from the gums.&lt;ref name="Shenk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northernndebele.blogspot.co.za/|title=isiNdebele for beginners.

Some examples are '''xoxa''' (discuss), '''ixoxo''' (frog).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5191">[[French language|French]] was the [[official language]] of [[Puducherry]] under the Treaty of Cession 1956. The Pondicherry Official Language Act, 1965 without mentioning French added the [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Malayalam]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as the official languages along with [[English language|English]]. 

== 1956 Treaty of Cession ==
French was the official language of the ''Établissements français dans l'Inde'' ([[French India]]) and it remained as [[de jure]] official language of Pondicherry U.T by the ''' ''Article XXVIII'' of [[Treaty establishing De Jure Cession of French Establishments in India|Traité de Cession]]''' which states that,
* ''Le français restera langue officielle des Établissements aussi longtemps que les répresentants élus de la population n'auront pas pris une décision différente'' (French version)

*''The French language shall remain the official language of the Establishments so long as the elected representatives of the people shall not decide otherwise'' (English version)

As of today, still the official gazette of Puducherry is published with French; albeit, with a marginal use &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://styandptg.pondicherry.gov.in/gazette/2005/January/ORDINARY/1/jan1_open_cover.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011022234/http://styandptg.pondicherry.gov.in/gazette/2005/January/ORDINARY/1/jan1_open_cover.pdf |archive-date=2017-10-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==1965 Pondicherry Official Language Act==
After independence, the new official languages got recognized by The Pondicherry Official Language Act, 1965 (Act No. 3 of 1965) which makes no mention of French (but also not officially denying it &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ecourts.gov.in/pondicherry/history |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402195506/http://ecourts.gov.in/pondicherry/history |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) establishes that "''the Tamil language shall [...] be the language to be used for all or any of the official purposes of the Union Territory''. It states that ''Provided that the Administrator may by like Notification, direct that in the case of Mahe area, the Malayalam language, and in the case of Yanam area, the Telugu language may be used for such official purposes and subject to such conditions as may be specified in such notification''". Finally, it states that "''Notwithstanding anything contained in section 3, and from the commencement of this Act, the English language may be used for all or any of the official purposes of the Union Territory''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lawsofindia.org/pdf/puducherry/1965/1965Pondicherry3.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911084318/http://www.lawsofindia.org/pdf/puducherry/1965/1965Pondicherry3.pdf |archive-date=2014-09-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early twentieth century, Tamil has got equal status along with the existing French language. After the merger with India, Telugu and Malayalam also obtained the same status although with some restrictions. Though the status of each languages varies with respect to each district, when communicating in between districts of different languages, generally English is used for convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sabt.org.in/npmb-india/downloads/travel-info.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145006/http://sabt.org.in/npmb-india/downloads/travel-info.pdf |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecourts.gov.in/pondicherry/history|title=History (Pondicherry)|publisher=District Courts of Pondicherry|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three official languages are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/English-to-continue-as-link-language-in-Puducherry-Court/articleshow/42400463.cms|title=English to continue as link language in Puducherry: Court|newspaper=The Times of India|date=14 September 2014|accessdate=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual content is a large factor in most [[:Category:Media content ratings systems|content rating systems]], such as those used for [[Television content rating systems|television programs]], [[Motion picture rating system|films]], and [[Video game content rating system|video games]]. Its increasing availability, especially the [[Internet]], has increased people's exposure to sexual content. Such exposure is not always wanted.&lt;ref name="Brown 2002" /&gt;

Research has suggested that exposure to sexual content affects people's thoughts and behavior, though there is disagreement as to the extent of the effect.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2005" /&gt; Gert Martin Hald, a psychologist at the University of Copenhagen, who authored a study which found  that watching "sexually explicit media" only accounted for 0.3 to 4.0 percent of behavior changes, said, "Our data suggest that other factors such as [[personality|personal dispositions]] — specifically sensation-seeking — rather than consumption of sexually explicit material may play a more important role in a range of sexual behaviors of adolescents and young adults." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/25/teen-sex-study-movies-content-adolescent-sexuality_n_3155762.html|title=Teen Sex Study Shows Racy Movies &amp; Online Content Have Little Effect On Adolescent Sexuality|last=Pappas|first=Stephanie|date=25 April 2013|work=[[LiveScience]]|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''speech error''', commonly referred to as a '''slip of the tongue'''&lt;ref name='David Carroll 1986'&gt;{{cite book |author=Carroll, David |title=Psychology of language |publisher=Brooks/Cole Pub. Co |location=Pacific Grove, CA, USA |year=1986 |pages=253–256 |isbn=0-534-05640-7 |oclc=12583436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[Latin]]: '''''lapsus linguae''''', or occasionally self-demonstratingly, '''''lipsus languae''''') or '''misspeaking''', is a deviation (conscious or unconscious) from the apparently intended form of an [[utterance]].&lt;ref name="Bussmann, Hadumod 1996"&gt;Bussmann, Hadumod. Routledge dictionary of language and linguistics. Routledge: London 1996, 449.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be subdivided into spontaneously and inadvertently produced [[speech]] errors and intentionally produced word-plays or puns. Another distinction can be drawn between production and comprehension errors. Errors in speech production and perception are also called performance errors.&lt;ref name='Tserdanelis Wong 2004'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Tserdanelis, Georgios |author2=Wai Sum Wong |title=Language files: materials for an introduction to language &amp; linguistics |publisher=Ohio State University Press |location=Columbus |year=2004 |pages=320–324 |isbn=0-8142-0970-X |oclc=54503589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of speech error include sound exchange or sound anticipation errors. In sound exchange errors the order of two individual morphemes is reversed, while in sound anticipation errors a sound from a later syllable replaces one from an earlier syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dell|first1=Gary S.|last2=Reich|first2=Peter A.|title=Stages in sentence production: An analysis of speech error data|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|date=December 1981|volume=20|issue=6|pages=611–629|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(81)90202-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slips of the tongue are a normal and common occurrence. One study shows that most people can make up to as much as 22 slips of the tongue per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201203/slips-the-tongue|title=Slips of the Tongue|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech errors are common among [[children]], who have yet to refine their speech, and can frequently continue into adulthood. When errors continue past the age of 9 they are referred to as "residual speech errors" or RSEs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They sometimes lead to embarrassment and betrayal of the speaker's [[region]]al or [[ethnic]] origins. However, it is also common for them to enter the [[popular culture]] as a kind of linguistic "flavoring". Speech errors may be used intentionally for humorous effect, as with [[Spoonerism]]s.

Within the field of [[psycholinguistics]], speech errors fall under the category of [[language]] production. Types of speech errors include: exchange errors, perseveration, anticipation, shift, substitution, blends, additions, and deletions. The study of speech errors has contributed to the establishment/refinement of models of speech production since [[Victoria Fromkin]]'s pioneering work on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~zwicky/Fromkin-non-anomalous.pdf|title=The Non-Anomalous Nature of Anomalous Utterances|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|date=|website=Stanford|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psycholinguistic explanations==

Speech errors are made on an occasional basis by all speakers.&lt;ref name='David Carroll 1986'/&gt; They occur more often when speakers are nervous, tired, anxious or intoxicated.&lt;ref name='David Carroll 1986'/&gt; During live broadcasts on TV or on the radio, for example, nonprofessional speakers and even hosts often make speech errors because they are under stress.&lt;ref name='David Carroll 1986'/&gt; Some speakers seem to be more prone to speech errors than others. For example, there is a certain connection between stuttering and speech errors.&lt;ref name='Hockett 1973'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hockett | first1 = Charles F. | title = Speech errors as linguistic evidence | chapter = Where the tongue slips, there slip I | editors = Victoria Fromkin | publisher = Mouton | year = 1973 | location = The Hague |pages=97–114 |oclc=1009093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles F. Hockett explains that "whenever a speaker feels some anxiety about possible lapse, he will be led to focus attention more than normally on what he has just said and on what he is just about to say. These are ideal breeding grounds for stuttering."&lt;ref name='Hockett 1973'/&gt; Another example of a "chronic sufferer" is Reverend William Archibald Spooner, whose peculiar speech may be caused by a cerebral dysfunction, but there is much evidence that he invented his famous speech errors (spoonerisms).&lt;ref name='David Carroll 1986'/&gt;

An outdated explanation for the occurrence of speech errors is that of Sigmund Freud, who assumed that speech errors are the result of an intrapsychic conflict of concurrent intentions.&lt;ref name='David Carroll 1986'/&gt; "Virtually all speech errors [are] caused by the intrusion of repressed ideas from the unconscious into one's conscious speech output", Freud explained.&lt;ref name='David Carroll 1986'/&gt; This gave rise to the expression [[Freudian slip]]. His hypothesis was rejected because it only explains a minority of speech errors.&lt;ref name='David Carroll 1986'/&gt;

==Psycholinguistic classification==

There are few speech errors that clearly fall into only one category. The majority of speech errors can be interpreted in different ways and thus fall into more than one category.&lt;ref&gt;Pfau, Roland. Grammar as processor: a distributed morphology account of spontaneous speech. John Benjamins Publishing Co.: Amsterdam 2009, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, percentage figures for the different kinds of speech errors may be of limited accuracy.&lt;ref name='Eysenck Keane 2005'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eysenck, Michael W. |author2=Keane, Mark A. |title=Cognitive Psychology: A Student's Handbook |publisher=Psychology Press (UK) |location= |year=2005 |pages=402 |isbn=1-84169-359-6 |oclc=608153953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the study of speech errors gave rise to different terminologies and different ways of classifying speech errors. Here is a collection of the main types:

===Types===
* [[Grammatical]] – For example, children take time to learn [[irregular verb]]s, so in [[English language|English]] use the -[[Past tense|ed]] form incorrectly. This is explored by Steven Pinker in his book ''[[Words and Rules]]''.
* [[Mispronunciation]]
* [[Vocabulary]] – [[Infant|Young children]] make [[Categorization|category]] approximations, using [[car]] for [[truck]] for example. This is known as [[hyponymy]].

====Examples====
* "par'''tic'''uly" (particu'''lar'''ly) ← [[elision]]
* "syn'''tax'''ically" (syn'''tact'''ically) ← [[vocabulary]]

==Scientific relevance==

Speech production is a highly complex and extremely rapid process so that research into the involved mental mechanisms is very difficult.&lt;ref name='Eysenck Keane 2005'/&gt; Investigating the audible output of the speech production system is a way to understand these mental mechanisms. According to Gary S. Dell "the inner workings of a highly complex system are often revealed by the way in which the system breaks down".&lt;ref name='Eysenck Keane 2005'/&gt; Therefore, speech errors are of an explanatory value with regard to the nature of language and language production.&lt;ref name="smithsrisca.demon.co.uk"&gt;Smith, Derek J. "Speech Errors, Speech Production Models, and Speech Pathology." Human Information Processing. Date of last revision: 12 December 2003. Date of access: 27th February 2010. {{cite web |url=http://www.smithsrisca.demon.co.uk/speech-errors.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205074434/http://www.smithsrisca.demon.co.uk/speech-errors.html |archivedate=5 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance errors may provide the linguist with empirical evidence for linguistic theories and serve to test hypotheses about language and speech production models.&lt;ref name='Fromkin 1973'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fromkin | first1 = Victoria | title = Speech errors as linguistic evidence | chapter = Introduction | editors = Victoria Fromkin | publisher = Mouton | year = 1973 | location = The Hague |pages=13 |oclc=1009093 | isbn = 90-279-2668-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For that reason, the study of speech errors is significant for the construction of performance models and gives insight into language mechanisms.&lt;ref name='Fromkin 1973'/&gt;

===Evidence and insights===

* Speech errors provide investigators with insights into the sequential order of language production processes.&lt;ref name='Eysenck Keane 2005'/&gt;
* Speech errors clue investigators in on the interactivity of language production modules.&lt;ref name="smithsrisca.demon.co.uk"/&gt;
* The existence of lexical or phonemic exchange errors provides evidence that speakers typically engage in forward planning their utterances. It seems that before the speaker starts speaking the whole utterance is available.&lt;ref name='Eysenck Keane 2005'/&gt;

: '''Anticipation'''
:: '''Target:''' Take my bike.
:: '''Error:''' Bake my bike.

: '''Perseveration'''
:: '''Target:''' He pulled a tantrum.
:: '''Error:''' He pulled a pantrum.

* Performance errors supply evidence for the psychological existence of discrete linguistic units.
: Speech errors involve substitutions, shifts, additions and deletions of segments. "In order to move a sound, the speaker must think of it as a separate unit."&lt;ref name='Tserdanelis Wong 2004'/&gt;  Obviously, one cannot account for speech errors without speaking of these discrete segments. They constitute the planning units of language production.&lt;ref name='David Carroll 1986'/&gt; Among them are distinctive features, phonemes, morphemes, syllables, words and phrases. Victoria Fromkin points out that "many of the segments that change and move in speech errors are precisely those postulated by linguistic theories." Consequently, speech errors give evidence that these units are psychologically real.

* One can infer from speech errors that speakers adhere to a set of linguistic rules.
:"There is a complex set of rules which the language user follows when making use of these units."&lt;ref name='Tserdanelis Wong 2004'/&gt;  Among them are for example phonetic constraints, which prescribe the possible sequences of sounds.&lt;ref name='Tserdanelis Wong 2004'/&gt;  Moreover, the study of speech error confirmed the existence of rules that state how morphemes are to be pronounced or how they should be combined with other morphemes.&lt;ref name='Tserdanelis Wong 2004'/&gt; The following examples show that speech errors also observe these rules:

:: '''Target:''' He likes to have his team rested. [rest+id]
:: '''Error:''' He likes to have his rest teamed. [ti:m+d]

:: '''Target:''' Both kids are sick. [kid+z]
:: '''Error:''' Both sicks are kids. [sik+s]

: Here the past tense morpheme resp. the plural morpheme is phonologically conditioned, although the [[Lemma (psycholinguistics)|lemmas]] are exchanged. This proves that first the lemmas are inserted and then phonological conditioning takes place.

:: '''Target:''' Don’t yell so loud! / Don’t shout so loud!
:: '''Error:''' Don’t shell so loud!

: "Shout" and "yell" are both appropriate words in this context. Due to the pressure to continue speaking, the speaker has to make a quick decision which word should be selected.&lt;ref name='Hockett 1973'/&gt;  This pressure leads to the speaker’s attempt to utter the two words simultaneously, which resulted in the creation of a blend.&lt;ref name='Hockett 1973'/&gt;  According to Charles F. Hockett there are six possible blends of "shout" and "yell".&lt;ref name='Hockett 1973'/&gt; Why did the speaker choose "shell" and not one of the alternatives? The speaker obeyed unconscious linguistic rules because he selected the blend, which satisfied the linguistic demands of these rules the best.&lt;ref name='Hockett 1973'/&gt; Illegal non-words are for example instantaneously rejected.

: In conclusion, the rules which tell language users how to produce speech must also be part of our mental organization of language.&lt;ref name='Tserdanelis Wong 2004'/&gt;

* Substitution errors, for instance, reveal parts of the organization and structure of the mental lexicon.

:: '''Target:''' My thesis is too long.
:: '''Error:''' My thesis is too short.

: In case of substitution errors both segments mostly belong to the same category, which means for example that a noun is substituted for a noun. Lexical selection errors are based on semantic relations such as synonymy, antonymy or membership of the same lexical field.&lt;ref name="Bussmann, Hadumod 1996"/&gt; For this reason the mental lexicon is structured in terms of semantic relationships.&lt;ref name='Tserdanelis Wong 2004'/&gt;

:: '''Target:''' George’s wife
:: '''Error:''' George’s life

:: '''Target:''' fashion square
:: '''Error:''' passion square

: Some substitution errors which are based on phonological similarities supply evidence that the mental lexicon is also organized in terms of sound.&lt;ref name='Tserdanelis Wong 2004'/&gt;

* Errors in speech are non-random. Linguists can elicit from the speech error data how speech errors are produced and which linguistic rules they adhere to. As a result, they are able to predict speech errors.

: '''Four generalizations about speech errors have been identified:'''&lt;ref name='David Carroll 1986'/&gt;
# Interacting elements tend to come from a similar linguistic environment, which means that initial, middle, final segments interact with one another.
# Elements that interact with one another tend to be phonetically or semantically similar to one another. This means that consonants exchange with consonants and vowels with vowels.
# Slips are consistent with the phonological rules of the language.
# There are consistent stress patterns in speech errors. Predominantly, both interacting segments receive major or minor stress.

* These four generalizations support the idea of the lexical bias effect. This effect states that our phonological speech errors generally form words rather than non-words. Baars (1975) showed evidence for this effect when he presented word pairs in rapid succession and asked participants to say both words in rapid succession back. In most of the trials, the mistakes made still formed actual words.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Information obtained from performance additions ==
An example of the information that can be obtained is the use of "um" or "uh" in a conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clark HH, Fox Tree JE |title=Using uh and um in spontaneous speaking |journal=Cognition |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=73–111 |date=May 2002 |pmid=12062148 |doi= 10.1016/S0010-0277(02)00017-3 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T24-45DFB5D-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F2002&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=66cc52a1b480c868234b971cbea36aed}}&lt;/ref&gt; These might be meaningful words that tell different things, one of which is to hold a place in the conversation so as not to be interrupted. There seems to be a hesitant stage and fluent stage that suggest speech has different levels of production. The pauses seem to occur between sentences, conjunctional points and before the first content word in a sentence. That suggests that a large part of speech production happens there.

Schachter et al. (1991) conducted an experiment to examine if the numbers of word choices affect pausing. They sat in on the lectures of 47 undergraduate professors from 10 different departments and calculated the number and times of filled pauses and unfilled pauses. They found significantly more pauses in the humanities departments as opposed to the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.60.3.362 | title = Speech Disfluency and the Structure of Knowledge | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | date = March 1991 | first = Stanley | last = Schachter |author2=Nicholas Christenfeld |author3=Bernard Ravina |author4=Frances Bilous | volume = 60 | issue = 3 | pages = 362–367| id = | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6X01-46VM34B-24&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F1991&amp;_alid=1433797102&amp;_rdoc=10&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=7201&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=415&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=5605d519a2afb054a7e40943dbf3254e | accessdate = 2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that the greater the number of word choices, the more frequent are the pauses, and hence the pauses serve to allow us time to choose our words.

Slips of the tongue are another form of "errors" that can help us understand the process of speech production better. Slips can happen at many levels, at the syntactic level, at the phrasal level, at the lexical semantic level, at the morphological level and at the phonological level and they can take more than one form like: additions, substations, deletion, exchange, anticipation, perseveration, shifts, and haplologies M.F. Garrett, (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Garrett | first1 = M. F. | title = The Psychology of learning and motivation. Volume 9 : advances in research and theory | chapter = The analysis of sentence production. | editors = Gordon H Bower | publisher = Academic Press, | year = 1975 | location = New York | pages = 133–177 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IUM7B00L4UUC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Garrett,+M.+F.+%281975%29.+The+analysis+of+sentence+production.#v=onepage&amp;q=Garrett%2C%20M.%20F.%20%281975%29.%20The%20analysis%20of%20sentence%20production.&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-0-12-543309-9 |  oclc=24672687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slips are orderly because language production is orderly.

There are some biases shown through slips of the tongue. One kind is a lexical bias which shows that the slips people generate are more often actual words than random sound strings. Baars Motley and Mackay (1975) found that it was more common for people to turn two actual words to two other actual words than when they do not create real words.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Output editing for lexical status in artificially elicited slips of the tongue | journal = Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior | date = August 1975 | first = Bernard J. | last = Baars, |author2=Michael T. Motley |author3=Donald G. MacKay | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 382–391| doi = 10.1016/S0022-5371(75)80017-X | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B7MD4-4H69YBX-5&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F1975&amp;_alid=1433781833&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=23220&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=79&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d4ff7ee97317fee6cfb5d59116c3becd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that lexemes might overlap somewhat or be stored similarly.

A second kind is a semantic bias which shows a tendency for sound bias to create words that are semantically related to other words in the linguistic environment. Motley and Baars (1976) found that a word pair like "get one" will more likely slip to "wet gun" if the pair before it is "damp rifle". These results suggest that we are sensitive to how things are laid out semantically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Semantic bias effects on the outcomes of verbal slips | journal = Cognition | year = 1976 | first = Michael T. | last = Motley |author2=Bernard J.

==Euphemistic misspeaking==
Although the roots of '''misspeaking''' roots lie in [[Middle English]] and earlier,&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oed.com/view/Entry/120034|title=misspeak, v.|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|date=June 2011|accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the 1980s the word has been used increasingly in politics to imply that errors made by a speaker are accidental and should not be construed as a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the facts of a case. As such, its usage has attracted a degree of media coverage, particularly from critics who feel that the term is overly [[approbative]] in cases where either ignorance of the facts or intent to misrepresent should not be discarded as possibilities.&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr. and Ms. Spoken|author=Hendrik Hertzberg|date=21 April 2008|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2008/04/21/080421taco_talk_hertzberg|accessdate=14 August 2011|publisher=''The New Yorker''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawson"/&gt;

The word was used by a White House spokesman after [[George W.

'''Tamar Bornstein-Lazar''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: תמר בּוֹרְנְשְׁטֵיין-לָזָר, born May 1, 1929) is an [[Israel]]i [[children's literature|children's writer]] who is best known for her book series featuring the [[monkey]]s [[Kofiko]] and Chipopo.

== Biography ==
Lazar was born and grew up in [[Ein Ganim]], studied at [[Ahad HaAm High School]] in [[Petah Tikva]], and later studied at the Teachers' College in [[Givat HaShlosha]]. During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], she served in a military band and was a teacher at Gordon School in Petah Tikva.

In 1950, Lazar began a literary career. From that year on, she has published hundreds of stories for infants for the majority of children's newspapers in Israel, which were later compiled into numerous books. In 1955, Lazar won the Yatziv Award for her literary work.&lt;ref&gt;http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=iejHnzpN6aQynKhH3CXszlXjMIMvjkKx%2B1hOi1JOjyd0Paa%2BOYXEF84KEXK8rnnFYw%3D%3D&amp;mode=image&amp;href=DAV%2f1955%2f02%2f09&amp;page=6&amp;rtl=true&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she began publishing a series of story compilations about the [[Jewish holidays|Jewish holiday]] periods.

Tamar Bornstein's first story was published in ''Davar LeYeladim'' on February 2, 1951. The story was called ''HaYalda m'HaMa'abara v'HaKochav MiMarom'' (הילדה מהמעברה והכוכב ממרום, lit: "The Girl from the [[Ma'abarot|Ma'abara]] and the Star from the Sky"). Its plot revolves around a star who brings a goat to a Ma'abara to heal an ill girl using goat milk. Her second story, ''Lama Schorot Kanfei HaOrev'' (למה שחורות כנפי העורב, lit: "Why Are the Crow's Wings Black"), appeared three months later.

In 1957, Lazar began publishing her famous humoristic books about Kofiko and Chipopo, following the adventures of the two monkeys (Kofiko in Israel, and Chipopo abroad). Both series have spanned dozens of books and were hugely successful in Israel. The books were met with negative reception from certain educators and literary critics due to what they referred to as "low-level writing".

Since 1965, she has written another children's book series about an American child named Charlie Letch and his adventures in Israel. Lazar is married to Shlomo with five children (four daughters and a son): Orna, Yoram, Noga and the twins Odelia and Zahara. The names of her family members are also those of the characters in the ''Kofiko'' book series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21771">The '''Teissier affair''' was a controversy that occurred in France in 2001. French astrologer [[Élizabeth Teissier]] was awarded a [[Doctorate]] in [[Sociology]] by [[Paris Descartes University]] for a [[doctoral thesis]] in which she argued that [[astrology]] was being oppressed by science. Her work was contested by the scientific community within the context of the [[science wars]], and compared to the [[Sokal hoax]]. Criticisms included the alleged failure to work within the field of [[sociology]] and also lacking the necessary [[scientific rigour]] for a doctoral thesis in any scientific field.  The university and jury who awarded the degree were harshly criticised, though both they and Teissier had supporters and defenders.

==Teissier's doctorate==
On April 7, 2001, Elizabeth Teissier [[Doctorate#France|defended her thesis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = http://ecolesdoctorales.parisdescartes.fr/ed180/content/download/56524/298247/version/1/file|language = French|title = Université Paris Decartes: école doctorale &amp;ndash; sciences humaines et sociales &amp;ndash; cultures, individus, sociétés|chapter = Procédure de Soutenance|pages = 15–18|publisher = [[Paris Descartes University|Université Paris Decartes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''Situation épistémologique de l'astrologie à travers l'ambivalence fascination-rejet dans les sociétés postmodernes''&lt;ref name = thesis&gt;{{cite thesis|first = Élizabeth|last = Teissier|title = Situation épistémiologique de l'astrologie à travers l'ambivalence fascination/rejet dans les sociétés postmodernes|type = Ph.D.|publisher = Paris Descartes University|year = 2001|url = http://theses.fr/2001PA05H017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Krivine /&gt; ("The Epistemological Situation of Astrology in Relation to the Ambivalent Fascination/Rejection of Postmodern Societies")&lt;ref name=Eakin /&gt; &amp;ndash; accounts of the defense have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.pseudo-sciences.org/spip.php?article386|title = Soutenance de la thèse d’Elizabeth Teissier|first = Jean-Paul|last = Krivine|date = 9 April 2001|accessdate = 14 October 2016|journal = [[Science et pseudo-sciences]]|publisher = [[Association française pour l'information scientifique]]|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Thèse de Mme.

==Initial reaction==
Controversy erupted in the scientific community following the decision, and several sociologists also publicly challenged its legitimacy.&lt;ref name = LeMonde&gt;Cf. [[Christian Baudelot]], [[Roger Establet]], ''[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=700655 La sociologie sous une mauvaise étoile]'', ''[[Le Monde]]'', 18 avril 2001 ; [http://www.homme-moderne.org/societe/socio/teissier/baudelot.html a copy is available from homme-moderne.org].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Liberation&gt;C.f., for example Alain Bourdin, ''[http://www.homme-moderne.org/societe/socio/teissier/bourdin.html La sociologie, l'antithèse de Teissier]'', [[Libération]], 19 avril 2001, and the articles published in the press review by the [[Association française pour l'information scientifique|AFIS]] : [http://www.pseudo-sciences.org/spip.php?article390 part 1], [http://www.pseudo-sciences.org/spip.php?article391 part 2], [http://www.pseudo-sciences.org/spip.php?article392 part 3], [http://www.pseudo-sciences.org/spip.php?article393 part 4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Serge Paugam, ''La Pratique de la sociologie'', Paris, [[Presses Universitaires de France|PUF]], 2008, &lt;abbr class="abbr" title="page(s)"&gt;p.&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;nbsp;117 ; cf. également Gérald Houdeville, ''Le Métier de sociologue en France depuis 1945. ''&lt;/ref&gt;  The university was criticised for granting the degree, as was the jury, along with Teissier's statements in support of astrology as a science,&lt;ref name = LeMonde /&gt;&lt;ref name = Liberation /&gt; though the university rejected accusations of "irresponsibility".&lt;ref name = UniPrez /&gt;  A petition signed by over 370 sociologists was sent to Professor [[Pierre Daumard]], the President of the university;&lt;ref name = ASES /&gt; he responded that the Teissier had complied with all university requirements and it is not his place to question the "guarantees of the scientific validity of the thesis" from the independent jury.&lt;ref name = UniPrez /&gt;  Daumard also defended that astrology is a legitimate subject for sociological study for its impact on society,&lt;ref name = UniPrez&gt;{{cite web|title = "René-Descartes" and Élizabeth Teissier|last = Daumard|first = Pierre|authorlink = Pierre Daumard|url = http://cibois.pagesperso-orange.fr/Contrib.htm#Daumard|language = French|year = 2001|accessdate = 9 October 2016|publisher = [[Association des sociologues enseignants du supérieur|ASES]] archives maintained by Philippe Cibois, former President}}&lt;/ref&gt; a point on which Teissier's critics agreed.&lt;ref name = AudouzeSavoie /&gt;  These critics were themselves criticised for their "incendiary" complaints which targeted her personally for her astrological beliefs instead of based on her thesis.&lt;ref name = Marcel&gt;{{cite news|url = http://archives.lesoir.be/carte-blanche-astrologie-sociologie-et-media_t-20010920-Z0KY81.html|title = Carte blanche Astrologie, sociologie et media|page = 17|date = 20 September 2001|accessdate = 8 October 2016|first = Marcel|last = Bolle de Bal|newspaper = [[Le Soir]]|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics were also described as engaging in a [[Witch-hunt#Figurative usage|witch-hunt]] whose true target was the academic reputation of Michel Maffesoli.&lt;ref name = Lazar&gt;{{cite news|first = Judith|last = Lazar|newspaper = [[Le Figaro]]|date = 28 May 2001|accessdate = 8 October 2016|url = http://www.homme-moderne.org/societe/socio/teissier/lazar.html|title = Faut-il brûler la thèse de l'astrologue Elizabeth Teissier? Retour sur une chasse aux sorcières|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maffesoli addressed the controversy in an email on 23 April 2001, acknowledging that the thesis included some "slippages" but minimising the importance of these errors.&lt;ref name = MaffesoliEmail&gt;{{cite journal|title = Comment devenir docteur en sociologie sans posséder le métier de sociologue?|first = Bernard|last = Lahire|journal = [[European Journal of Social Sciences]]|volume = 40|issue = 122: Sociologie et Sociologues Pour Quoi Faire?|year = 2002|pages = 41–65|url = http://ress.revues.org/629|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maffesoli added that there is a "manhunt" against him and more broadly against scientific and intellectual rigor in "diverse approaches to sociology",&lt;ref name = MaffesoliEmail /&gt; but still engaged with critics such as [[Christian Baudelot]] at an ASES-organised symposium on the Teissier affair.&lt;ref name = ASES&gt;{{cite web|first = Daniel|last = Filâtre|url = http://cibois.pagesperso-orange.fr/HistTeissier.htm|title = Affaire Teissier: historique &amp;ndash; Présentation par Daniel Filâtre, président de l'Ases (extrait de la Lettre de l'ASES 30 de décembre 2001)|date = 30 December 2001|accessdate = 8 October 2016|publisher = [[Association des sociologues enseignants du supérieur|ASES]] archives maintained by Philippe Cibois, former President|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Morin&gt;{{cite news|first = Hervé|last = Morin|url = http://pagesperso-orange.fr/cibois/Morin2.htm|title = La thèse d'Elizabeth Teissier ravive la fracture au sein de la sociologie|newspaper = ''[[Le Monde]]''|date = 15 May 2001|accessdate = 9 October 2016|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Morin2&gt;{{cite news|first = Hervé|last = Morin|url = http://www.pseudo-sciences.org/spip.php?article392|title = La thèse d'Élizabeth Teissier passée au crible des critiques rationalistes|newspaper = ''[[Le Monde]]''|date = 18 August 2001|accessdate = 12 October 2016|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maffesoli did state during the defense that he had tried to keep Teissier focused on the sociological impact of astrology rather than discussing its scientific legitimacy, while still maintaining that the thesis demonstrated sufficient sociological significance to justify awarding the doctorate.

==AFIS analysis==
Once the thesis was available following the defense, the [[Association française pour l'information scientifique]] (AFIS) organised for a group to critique the thesis;&lt;ref name = Morin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pseudo-sciences.org/spip.php?article389|title = Communiqué de l’AFIS|date = 11 April 2001|accessdate = 6 October 2016|author = [[Association française pour l'information scientifique]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the analysis was published by a multi-disciplinary group (two experts in pseudoscience, including the editor of the AFIS ''[[Science et pseudo-sciences]]'', three astrophysicists, two sociologists, and a philosopher) on 6 August 2001.&lt;ref name = AnalysisLahire&gt;{{cite book|title = Analyse de la thèse de Madame Elizabeth Teissier soutenue le 7 avril 2001 à l'Université Paris et intitulée: Situation épistémologique de l'astrologie à travers l'ambivalence fascination/reject dans les sociétés postmodernes|date = 6 August 2001|accessdate = 12 October 2016|language = French|publisher = [[Association française pour l'information scientifique]]|first1 = Bernard|last1 = Lahire|first2 = Phillipe|last2 = Cibois|first3 = Dominique|last3 = Desjeux|first4 = Jean|last4 = Audouze|first5 = Henri|last5 = Broch|first6 = Jean-Paul|last6 = Krivine|first7 = Jean-Claude|last7 = Pecker|first8 = Denis|last8 = Savoie|first9 = Jacques|last9 = Bouveresse|authorlink4 = Jean Audouze|authorlink7 = Jean-Claude Pecker|authorlink9 = Jacques Bouveresse|url = http://www.unice.fr/zetetique/articles/Groupe_relecture_Teissier.pdf}} Also available as a .doc file at [http://www.homme-moderne.org/societe/socio/teissier/analyse/analyse.doc home-modern.org] and originally [http://www.pseudo-sciences.org/spip.php?article404&amp;var_recherche=teissier published on the website] of the AFIS journal ''[[Science et pseudo-sciences]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unice.fr/zetetique/articles/HB_These_Teissier.html l'analyse d'Henri Broch], 2001 ; [http://www.homme-moderne.org/societe/socio/teissier/analyse/index.html Analyse de la thèse de Madame Elizabeth Teissier], 6 août 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  They looked at the scientific, philosophical, and sociological aspects of Teissier's thesis,&lt;ref name = AnalysisLahire /&gt; describing it as "not a thesis in sociology but actually pro-astrological advocacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = COMMUNIQUÉ À LA PRESSE|date = 25 April 2001|accessdate = 6 October 2016|url = http://www.pseudo-sciences.org/spip.php?article389|author = [[Association française pour l'information scientifique]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They concluded that the Teissier's work did not meet the requirements of scientific rigor of doctoral research, regardless of the discipline in question.&lt;ref name="homme-moderne.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.homme-moderne.org/societe/socio/teissier/analyse/|title=Analyse de la thèse de Madame Elizabeth Teissier|author=Bernard Lahire |author2=Philippe Cibois |author3=[[Dominique Desjeux]] |author4=Jean Audouze |author5=Henri Broch |author6=Jean-Paul Krivine |author7=Jean-Claude Pecker |author8=Jacques Bouveresse|date=6 August 2001|access-date=6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They described the jury as having accepted the thesis "in defiance of basic academic requirements of objectivity and intellectual honesty" in part because the AFIS group's multidisciplinary analysis shows that "no relevant standard (analytical rigor, objectivity, indication of sources, style of writing, etc.) had truly been fulfilled".&lt;ref name = AudouzeSavoie /&gt;  They comment all Teissier has achieved is to "demonstrate once again that [astrology] does not deserve the status of an intellectual discipline that can be taught in a university course".&lt;ref name = AudouzeSavoie&gt;{{cite journal|title = À propos de la " thèse " de Madame Élizabeth Teissier|date = 1 October 2001|accessdate = 6 October 2016|url = http://www.pseudo-sciences.org/spip.php?article392|first1 = Jean|last1 = Audouze|authorlink1 = Jean Audouze|first2 = Denis|last2 = Savoie|authorlink2 = Denis Savoie|journal = [[Science et pseudo-sciences]]|publisher = [[Association française pour l'information scientifique]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the journal ''[[Skepter]]'', the "thesis pretends to provide irrefutable proof that astrology is a science, but the author has no idea what constitutes a scientific proof, she is muddleminded about basic astronomical and astrological facts, and the ''pièce de resistance'' of her argument consists of statements about [[Michel Gauquelin]] which can only be called lies."&lt;ref name = Skepter /&gt;  Examples of excerpts from the thesis which bear this out, according to Broch, include unsupported medical claims, fundamental errors in [[astronomy]], and a lack of proper evidence.&lt;ref name = BrochNienhuys&gt;{{cite web|title = On the doctoral thesis of Ms Germaine (Elizabeth) Teissier|first1 = Henri|last1 = Broch|first2 = Jan W.|last2 = Nienhuys|authorlink2 = Jan Willem Nienhuys|url = http://www.unice.fr/zetetique/articles/HB_JWN_Teissier_thesis.html|accessdate = 6 October 2016|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teissier was "completely appalled" that a "tiny group" would question the award of her doctorate and did not exclude the possibility of suing the AFIS, who published the critique of her thesis, after its "intolerable attack" on [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref name = Morin2 /&gt;

==Wider context==
Discussion of the circumstances of Teissier's doctorate occurred and continues to occur with the context of the [[science wars]], a dispute which pitted humanities academics taking [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] perspectives against scientists taking [[positivism|positivist]] and [[rationalism|rationalist]] approaches.&lt;ref name = Weldon&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=yfZEE5kGcTkC&amp;pg=PT355&amp;dq=postmodernist+scholarship+understanding+science&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHz-61xM_PAhUl7YMKHQeTCZUQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=postmodernist%20scholarship%20understanding%20science&amp;f=false|chapter = 29: The Social Construction of Science|first = Stephen P.|last = Weldon|title = Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction|editor-first = Gary B.|editor-last = Ferngren|publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|year = 2013|isbn = 9781421412825}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, comparisons have been made to the [[Sokal hoax]], in that each case exemplifies the alleged support for pseudoscience and hostility to science within postmodernist circles.&lt;ref name = Bricmont&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Skeptical Adversaria|publisher = [[Association for Skeptical Enquiry]]|first = Michael|last = Heap|title = The 12th European Skeptics Congress|year = 2005|issue = 4|url = http://www.aske-skeptics.org.uk/resources/Adversaria/Adversaria2005-4.doc|page = 5|volume = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter = Science Wars?

'''Torres Strait Creole''' (also ''Torres Strait Pidgin, Yumplatok, Torres Strait Brokan/Broken, Cape York Creole, Lockhart Creole, Papuan [[List of English-based pidgins|Pidgin English]], Broken English, Brokan/Broken, Blaikman, Big Thap, Pizin, Ailan Tok''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pacific Pidgins and Creoles|last=Tryon|first=Darrell T.|last2=Charpentier|first2=Jean-Michel|publisher=Die Deutsche Bibliothek|year=2004|isbn=3-11-016998-3|location=Berlin|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[English-based creole languages|English-based creole language]] spoken on several [[Torres Strait Islands]] ([[Queensland]], [[Australia]]), Northern Cape York and South-Western Coastal Papua. It has approximately 25,000 [[mother-tongue]] and bi/tri-lingual speakers, as well as several second/third-language speakers. It is widely used as a language of trade and commerce.
Torres Strait Creole has six main dialects: Papuan, Western-Central, TI, Malay, Eastern, and Cape York. Its main characteristics show that it is a Pacific Pidgin, but the future in ''X [i] go VERB'' aligns it with Atlantic Creoles. Related languages are [[Pijin]] of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tok Pisin]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[Bislama]] of [[Vanuatu]]. The other creoles of Australia (such as Roper River Kriol and [[Australian Kriol language]]) are more distantly related, being descendants of the Pidgin English that developed in and around Sydney after the colonisation of Australia.

==History==
Records of pidgin English being used in Torres Strait exist from as early as the 1840s (e.g. Moore 1979), and therefore Torres Strait Creole may very well be as old as, if not older, than its sister languages, and not a descendant of any of these. The main importers of the pidgin were British and other sailors, many of whom were South Sea Islanders, both Melanesian and Polynesian, as well as Island South-East Asians, [[Jamaicans]], [[Cantonese people|Cantonese Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], and others. Therefore, Torres Strait Creole has various characteristics of these different types of Pidgin, the main ones being mid- to late 1800s Malay-area Pidgin English (but not [[Singlish]], one of its modern representatives), Pacific Pidgin and [[Jamaican Patois]]. It may have creolised quite early (pre-1900) on [[Darnley Island (Queensland)|Darnley Island]], and somewhat later (post-1910) at [[St Paul's Island|St Pauls]] on [[Moa Island (Queensland)|Moa]] and on [[Yorke Island (Queensland)|Yorke Island]] in the Central Islands. Creolisation is post-1960s elsewhere.

The Papuan dialect was replaced by [[Hiri Motu]] in many parts of its former territory, which in turn is being replaced by [[Tok Pisin]].

==Dialects==
[[Dialect]]s differ mainly from the influences in the various areas the language is spoken or by the language of the ethnic groups that use the language as well as a certain amount of superstrata influence from English. Apart from accent and intonation, differences are mainly vocabulary used for local fauna, flora and so on, retentions from local indigenous languages or other substrata languages (such as Malay) and minor differences in pronunciation because of substrata influences.

The dialects group generally into the Western-Central-Cape York dialects where the western and central language of Torres Strait (Kala Lagaw Ya) has a strong influence (an influence which is also 'over-powering' other sub-strata influences), 'TI' Brokan with a strong [[Malay language|Malay]]/[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]-[[Filipino language|Filipino]]-European influence, Eastern Brokan with a South Seas and [[Meriam Mìr]] influence, and Papuan, with influences from languages such as [[Agöb]], [[Bine language|Bine]], [[Gizrra]], [[Wipi]], [[Kiwai]], [[Motu language|Motu]] and (now) [[Tok Pisin]]. Influences from other languages such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are to do with vocabulary specific to Japanese (or the like) items.

==Continuum==
Torres Strait Creole exists as part of a lect continuum: a local language, a local language mix called Ap-ne-Ap, a pidgin basilect creole, a mesolect creole called Torres Strait (Thursday Island) English, and General [[Australian English]], as this example shows:
* English: ''I'm really tired''
* Thursday Island English: ''I'm proper tired''
* Mesolect Brokan: ''Ai prapa taiad''
* Basilect Brokan: ''Ai mina taiad''
* Ap-ne-Ap: ''Ngai mina taiad mepa''
* Kalau Kawau Ya: ''Ngai mina gamukœubaasipa''

==Phonology==

The dental-alveolar contrast exists in the Western, Central and Cape York dialects, however only exists in other dialects in so far as either English or Western-Central influences force a contrast, or where the voiced alveolar stop {{angbr|d}} realises as the rhotic tap {{angbr|r}} (e.g. Western-Central ''wasamada'' 'what's the matter/what's wrong', Eastern/Papuan ''wasamara''). In the Papuan dialects, the only alveolar consonant is {{angbr|r}}, while {{angbr|t}} and {{angbr|d}} can be either dental (i.e. fall together with {{angbr|th}} and {{angbr|dh}}) or alveolar, according to local language. In Meriam influenced Broken, {{angbr|t}} is dental, while {{angbr|d}} is alveolar.

The stops {{angbr|p}}, {{angbr|b}}, {{angbr|th}}, {{angbr|dh}}, {{angbr|k}} and {{angbr|g}} are [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and also have fricative allophones, particularly {{angbr|p}} (thus {{IPA|[pʰ~ɸ]}}, {{IPA|[bʱ~β]}}, {{IPA|[t̪ʰ~θ]}}, {{IPA|[d̪ʱ~ð]}}, {{IPA|[kʰ~x]}}, {{IPA|[ɡʱ~ɣ]}}) while {{angbr|s}} and {{angbr|z}} vary in pronunciation when word initial and medial between {{IPA|[s~z]}} and {{IPA|[tʃ~dʒ]}}, with only {{IPA|[s~z]}} appearing at the ends of words in Torres Strait and Papuan dialects. These reflect indigenous language allophony as well as a rationalisation of the larger English (and Malay, etc.) consonant phoneme inventory. The consonants {{angbr|t}}, {{angbr|d}}, {{angbr|m}}, {{angbr|n}}, {{angbr|l}}, {{angbr|w}}, {{angbr|y}} and {{angbr|ng}} do not have any major allophonic variation, while {{angbr|r}} varies between {{IPA|{{IPAlink|ɾ}} and {{IPAlink|r}} (particularly when syllable final), and in songs is often pronoucned {{IPAlink|ɹ}}]}}.

==Grammar==

===Pronouns===
The following are the forms of the [[personal pronoun]]s in the Western-Central-Cape York dialects. Where the Eastern dialect is concerned, the dental-alveolar contrast is on the whole non-operative, and the dual forms are less commonly used than elsewhere. Furthermore, the 1-2 form ''yumi'' is often used as the general non-singular 1-2 form; and is sometimes used as such in other dialects in rhetorical discourse. The Central Islands dialect (and sometimes others) tends to also use ''wi'' for the 1st person plural.

{| class="wikitable"
! number !! 1st person !! 1st-2nd person !! 2nd person !! 3rd person (identifying) !! 3rd person (non-identifying)
|-
! singular subject
| ai || — || yu || em || i
|-
! singular non-subject (where different)
| mi || — || — || — || em
|-
! dual subject
| mitu || yumi || yutu || dhemtu || --
|-
! dual object (where different)
| — || — || — || dhemtu/-emtu || --
|-
! plural subject
| mipla || yumpla || yupla || dhempla || òl
|-
! plural object (where different)
| — || — || — || dhempla/-empla || dhempla/-empla
|}

The non-identfying 3rd plural ''òl'' is also found as a nominal plural marker:
* ''I gad òl bùk ianau'' 'There are books here'

==== Interrogatives and Demonstratives ====
* this, these: full form ''dhiswan'', colloquial form ''dhisan'', reduced, clause initial form ''san'', ''sa''
* that, those: full form ''dhaswan'', colloquial form ''dhasan'', reduced, clause initial form ''san'', ''sa''
There is a strong tendency for ''dhiswan'' and its forms to be used to the exclusion of ''dhaswan''.
* Who is that? ''Dhaswan i udhat?'', ''Dhiswan dhe i udhat?'', ''Dhasan i udhat?'', ''Dhisan dhe i udhat?'', ''Dhisan i udhat?'', ''San i udhat?'', ''San dhe i udhat?''

Three interrogatives and the two deictics have two forms, this being (interrogatives) a reduced clause initial form and a fuller clause final form, and in the case of the deitics, a pre-clitic and independent form, as in the following examples:

* ''Wane yu luk?'' [alt. ''Wane yu lukem?''] / ''Yu luk wanem?'' 'What do you see?'
* ''Kenu i ya kam.'' / ''Kenu i kam iya.'' 'A canoe is coming this way.'

Clause position variation(initial, final)
* what: ''wane'', ''wanem''
* where: ''we'', ''wea''
* who: ''udha'', ''udhat''
Pre-clitic vs independent form:
* there: ''dhe'', ''dhea''
* here: ''ya'', ''iya''

Two interrogatives have variant words/forms, used interchangeably:
* when: ''wataim'', ''wen''
* why: ''aukam'', ''wanempò''

Dialectal variation is only found in two forms:
* how: ''wiswei''; Central Islands: ''waswei''
* why, what's the matter: ''wasamada''; Eastern-Papuan ''wasamara''

===Articles===
The language has no indefinite [[Article (grammar)|article]], and uses the definite article much less than it is in English, having a more demonstrative feel than the English equivalent. There are singular, dual and plural forms:
* singular: ''dha'' — ''dha kenu'' 'the canoe'
* dual: ''dhemtu'', ''dhostu'' — ''dhemtu kenu'', ''dhostu kenu'' 'the two canoes'
* plural: ''dhem'' — ''dhem kenu'' 'the canoes'
The demonstrative articles have a general form, and a specific dual form, as well as variation, with a strong tendency to use the [[clitic]]s ''iya'' and ''dhea'' to specify position; the definitie articles are often used with the demonstrative clitics to express the demonstrative articles :
* this man: ''dhis man'', ''dhis man ia''
* these men (dual): ''dhistu man'', ''dhistu man ia'', ''dhemtu man ia''
* these men (plural): ''òl dhis man'', ''òl dhis man ia'', ''dhem man ia''
* all these men: ''òlgedha man ia''
* that man: ''dhas/dhat man'', ''dhis man dhea''
* those men (dual): ''dhostu man'', ''dhistu man dhea'', ''dhemtu man dhea''
* those men (plural): ''òl dhas/dhat man'', ''òl dhis man dhea'', ''dhem man dhea''
* all those men: ''òlgedha man dhea''

===Syntax===
Torres Strait Creole is a somewhat atypical of Pidgin-Creole languages in its word order and various other syntactic (and grammatical) properties. Though the normal sentence word order is the expected transitive [[Subject–verb–object|S-V-O]]-X(-) and intransitive S-V-X(-), there is variation in the form of S-X-V(-O), such as where the directional adverbs ''dhe'' 'there' and ''ia/ya'' 'here' come before the verb, as happens in all local languages (this is in common with virtually all verb [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense/aspect/mood]] markers in the language).
* Verb clause strings are normal in the language:
** ''Bala blo mi bi teke kenu kam baik.'' 'My brother brought the canoe back'
** ''Plein i dhe plai go'' / ''Plein i dhe go plai'' / ''Plein i plai dhe go'' / ''Plein i plai go dhea'' 'The plane is flying away (over) there'

The four sentences in Torres Strait Creole carry a semantic difference difficult to show in the English translation. ''Plein i dhe go plai'' is the basic sentence — 'the plane is flying [away] over there'. ''Plein i plai dhe go'' is more along the lines of 'the plane is flying away that way'; ''plein i plai go dhea'' is 'the plane is flying away heading that way', and finally ''plein i dhe plai go'' is 'the plane is there flying away'.
* Unlike many pidgin-creoles, the adjective categorically comes before the noun. Similarly, adverbs that mark adjectives come before the adjective:
** ''Big sisi bl'em bi kese tu prapa big redkala pis lo ausaid sanbaing.'' 'His/her big sister caught two really big red fish at/on the outer sandbank'
Unlike [[Tok Pisin]], [[Bislama]] and the Australian creoles, ''-pla'' is not used as an adjective formant.

When not before the referent, adjectives are often suffixed by '''-wan''', the adjective nominaliser, or by an appropriate nominal, such as ''man'' 'man, person'
** ''Bala blo mi i bigwan / bigman.'' 'My brother is big'
** ''Dhis dhamba ya i prapa naiswan.'' 'This bread is really nice'
* All verb tense and aspect markers come before the verb (see Verbs below), apart from the clitic ''nau''.
* A fully operational relative clause structure exists, marked by the relative clause marker ''we'':
** ''Dha totol we ai bi kese em i stap ananith lo aus.'' 'The turtle I caught is under the house'
** ''Ama bin luk smol gel we i dhe sidaun krai krai krai lo skul blo dhem piknini.'' 'Mum saw a little girl (who was) sitting and crying at the kids' school'
* Questions vary between using English/Merima Mìr-like word order, i.e. question word initially, or Kala Lagaw Ya/Malay-like word order, i.e. question word order is the same as that of statements. As stated above, the question word has its full form when used clause finally, and a reduced form otherwise. In yes-no questions, statement word order is normal, with the use of a question tag sentence clitic:
** ''We yu go?'' / ''Yu go wea?'' 'Where are you going?'
** ''Udha nem blo yu?'' / ''Nem blo yu udhat?'' 'What is your name?'
** ''Wataim em i go kam bai'gen?'' / ''Em i go kam bai'gen wataim?'' 'When is he going to come back?'
** ''Aukam yu sabe blaikman tok?'' 'How come you can speak the black people's language?'
** ''Bambai athe blo dhemtu i go stap ospetal au?'' 'Is their grandfather going to stay in hospital?'
** ''Yu pinis luk piksa a?'' 'Have you finished watching the film?'

===Verbs===
====Transitivity and Voice====

Verbs can be marked for [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]] and [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] ([[Transitive verb|transitive]]-[[Passive voice|passive]] or [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]-[[Antipassive voice|antipassive]]), but not [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] or [[Grammatical mood|mood]]. Voice marking is for the transitive-passive, and made by [[suffix]]ing ''-e'' to the verb stem when the object follows the verb, and ''-em'' when the object is elsewhere in the clause. Note that the suffix ''-em'' is of fairly recent development, and is in origin an abbreviation of the verb phrase form ''VERB-e em'', where the cross referencing pronoun '''''em''''' and the suffix have coalesced (via ''-i em'' → ''-yem'' → ''-em''). All these versions exist in everyday speech. The verb mentioned below is ''tek'' 'to take': intransitive-antipassive ''tek'', transitive-passive ''teke'', ''teki em'', ''tekyem'', ''tekem'':
* ''Em yustu tek òl buk.'' 'He used to/would take took all books' (antipassive)
* ''Em yustu teke dhem buk.'' 'He used to take the books' (transitive)
* ''Em yustu teke buk.'' 'He used to take a/the book' (transitive)
* ''Dha buk we em i yustu bi tekem i brok.'' 'The book he used to take is broken' (fronted transitive)
** Variants: ''Dha buk we em i yustu bi teke em'' / ''teki em'' / ''tekyem i brok.''
The development of a full passive using this form also exists:
* ''Buk i yustu bi tekem lo em/prom em.'' 'A/The book used to be taken by him.' the ''lo''–''prom'' variation is dialectal)

===== Phonological variation of the transitive suffix =====
If the verb stem has ''e'' or a diphthong, then the transitive suffix is '''-e'''; if ''i'' or ''u'', then it can become '''-i''', while of the stem contains ''a'' or ''o'', the suffix can become '''-a'''. One or two others verbs have stem extensions to form the verb from a noun:
* ''teke'' → ''teke'' 'take, bring'
* ''laite'' → ''laite'' 'light'
* ''pute'' → ''puti'' 'put'
* ''pile'' → ''pili'' 'feel something'
* ''broke'' → ''broka'' 'break'
* ''ama'' 'hammer' → verb ''amare''
* ''pain'' 'point' → verb ''painte''

Verb stems that end in vowels do not take the suffix, while a few verbs are irregular in not taking the suffix:
# Vowel-final stem: ''lego'' 'to leave, depart, go off/away, throw, throw at'
#* ''Aka bi lego lo kenu.'' 'Grandma went off in the canoe'
#* ''Dhem nugud boi bin lego ston pò dhempla.'' 'The bad boys threw stones at them'
# No suffix: ''luk''
#* ''Ai bi luk pisin plai kam.'' 'I saw a bird flying towards me' (the suffixed form is sometimes used: ''Ai bi luki pisin plai kam'').

====Verbs of position and movement====

Certain verbs of position and movement are not followed by a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]] in their most normal clause types. These are not to be confused with transitive clauses:
* ''Awa bi stap aus bikòs em i sikwan.'' 'Uncle stayed (at) home because he is sick'
* ''Dhem piknini stap dhe Bamaga we Kolez.'' 'The children stay at Bamaga at the College'
* ''Dha dog dhe ran go dingi.'' 'The/a dog is running to the dinghy'
* ''Pusi i sidaun seya.'' 'The cat is sitting in/on the chair'

====Verb suffixes====

Four derivational [[suffix]]es exist which add [[Grammatical aspect|aspectual]] meaning to verb stems. Though their origin are English intransitive prepositions, in Torres Strait Creole their status is completely aspectual; they can only be used as suffixes. They are suffixes to the stem of intransitive verbs, and to the full transitive-passive form of transitive verbs. When used as transitive-passive verbs, they also suffix the transitive ending after the suffix. They also derive verbs from other words.
* ''-ap'' — completive, perfective: ''piksimap(e)'' 'to fix, repair, mend'; ''rol'' 'roll' → ''rolemap(e)'' 'to roll up'; ''bagarap(e)'' 'to ruin, break, destroy'
* ''-aut'' — movement outwards: ''kamaut'' 'to come out'; ''goaut'' 'to go out'; ''lugaut(e)'' 'to be careful, beware, take care of, look after'
* ''-baut'' — dispersive (this suffix causes the final voiceless consonant of the stem to become voiced): ''wagbaut'' 'to walk, walk about, walk around, stroll'; ''togbaut(e)'' 'to talk about/over, discuss'
* ''-daun'' — downwards movement: Only found on ''godaun'' 'movement downwards from a starting point'; ''kamdaun'' 'movement downwards from above', ''sidaun'' 'to sit down', ''pòldaun'' 'to fall, fall over, fall down'.

===Prepositions===
Torres Strait Creole shows strong substrata influence in its use of its [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]]. All local languages are either prepositionless case-marking agglutinative languages, or case-marking agglutinative languages where the case endings have evolved to postposition status, which contrast the following cases to varying extents, but which have little or no number marking on nouns:
* [[Nominative case|nominative]]
* [[Accusative case|accusative]]
* [[Ergative case|ergative]]
* [[Genitive case|genitive]]
* [[Dative case|dative]]
* [[Ablative case|ablative]]
* [[Locative case|locative]]
* [[Perlative case|perlative]]
* [[Instrumental case|instrumental]]
They also contrast the following derived forms (among others according to language), which are not case forms in the local languages, but rather nominals:

* similative
* privative
* proprietive
* resultative

The use of the prepositions in Torres Strait Creole reflect these cases and nominalisations to a certain (= simplified) extent:

'''blo''' — genitive: &lt;br&gt; '''We aus blo misnari?''' ''Where is the priest’s house?''

'''pò''', '''lo''' — dative (in part dialect variation): &lt;br&gt; '''Em i bin spik pò em se wesis bl’em pinis kam.''' ''She told her her wages had already arrived.''&lt;br&gt; '''Bos i bi gibi wesis pò/lo mi.''' ''The boss gave the wages to me.''

'''prom''' – ablative: &lt;br&gt; '''’San i dhe kam prom Dhaudhai.''' ''This one is coming over from Papua.''

'''lo''', '''we''', '''ene''' — locative, perlative ('''lo''' and '''we''' are synonyms, and '''ene''' is an archaic word now normally found only in old songs): &lt;br&gt; '''Aus blo Ama blo mi i stanap dhe antap lo / we il ananith lo / we big mango dhe antap.''' ''My Aunty’s house is up there on the hill underneath the big mango up there.'' &lt;br&gt; '''Yu mas kam wantaim lo mi.''' ''You must/have to come with me.'' &lt;br&gt; '''Dhemtu baradha i sidaun ene [lo/we] kenu''' ''The two brothers were sitting in the canoe.''

'''lo''' — instrumental: &lt;br&gt; '''Òl man i kate tœtœl lo naip lo bele / lo ath''' ''The men cut (butcher) the turtle with a knife on the bottom shell''.

'''òlsem''', '''waze''' ('''waze''' is the somewhat more common reduced form of '''òlsem''') – similative (like): &lt;br&gt; '''Dhempla lo Mari Ailan i no tòk waze yumpla'''. ''The people on Murray Island don’t talk like us.'' &lt;br&gt; '''Em i dhe swim go waze aligeta.''' ''He’s swimming away over there like a crocodile.''

==== Syntactic use of the prepositions ====
The prepositions also have [[Syntax|syntactic]] uses, including the following, where they govern verbs or adjectives:

'''Blo''': obligation &lt;br&gt; '''Ai blo go nau''' ''I have to go now / I’m supposed to go now''.

'''Pò''': a) focus on a goal &lt;br&gt; '''Bos i kam pò luk wòk blo yumi.''' ''The boss has come to see / look at our work.'' &lt;br&gt; b) extra intensity &lt;br&gt; '''Dhem pipol blo Saibai i pò dans!''' ''The Saibai people can really dance!'' &lt;br&gt; '''Ai pò taiad nau!''' ''I’m getting really tired!''

'''Prom''': avoidance &lt;br&gt; '''Smòl gel i prait prom dog i baite em.''' ''The little girl is afraid that the dog will bite her''

'''lo''', '''prom''' — comparative (dialect variation): &lt;br&gt; '''Dhis dhangal ia i mò big prom/lo nadhawan dhea''' ''This dugong is bigger than that one''.

'''We''': relative clause &lt;br&gt; '''Aus we Ama i stap i antap lo il we i gad wan big mango.''' ''The house where Aunty lives is on the hill where there is a big mango.'' &lt;br&gt; '''Boi we yumi bin paitem i krai go Ama bl'em.''' ''The boy that/who we fought went off crying to his Mum.'' &lt;br&gt; '''Òl pipol we i wande gud wòk i mas lane ingglis''' ''Everyone who wants a good job has to learn English.''

'''Waze''' ('''òlsem'''): in order, so that &lt;br&gt; '''Bos i kam waze em i ken luk òl wòk blo yumi.''' ''The Boss is coming so that he can see our work.''

==Vocabulary==
The language has vocabulary from various sources, though the dominant source language is English. Here are lists of Non-English words found in Torres Strait Creole:

[[Kalaw Kawaw Ya]]: ''yawo'' 'goodbye', ''matha'' 'only, very', ''mina'' 'really, truly', ''babuk'' 'crosslegged', ''aka'' 'granny', ''puripuri'' 'magic action, spells, products, medicines etc.' (from the early Kauraraigau Ya [Kowrareg — the Southern dialect of [[Kalaw Lagaw Ya]] word ''puri''], in modern Kala Lagaw Ya the word is ''puyi'').

[[Meriam Mir]]: ''baker'' (''bakìr'') 'money' (beside the more general ''baks''), ''watai'' (''wathai'') 'bamboo break-wind fence'.

[[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] ([[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], [[Rotuman language|Rotuman]], etc.): ''thalinga'' 'ear', ''bala'' 'brother, male friend', ''thuba'' 'coconut toddy', ''makan'' 'to eat', ''dudu'' 'to sit', ''kaikai'' 'to eat', ''nene'' 'granny', ''datho'',  'grandfather', ''thawian'' 'brother-in-law'.

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''pikinini'' child, ''sabe'' 'to know, understand, know how to, can'

'''Ulf Gottfrid Stark''' (12 July 1944 – 13 June 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birthday.se/sok/?f=Ulf&amp;l=Stark&amp;y=1944 |title=Sök personer |publisher=Birthday.se |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[author]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barncancerfonden.se/Behallare/Tidning/Tidigare-nummer/20061/Barn--Cancer-106/Kronika-Ulf-Stark-/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[screenwriter]] (he adapted several of his own books for film and wrote the screenplay for the 1999 film ''[[Tsatsiki, morsan och polisen]]'').

Stark has collaborated with the illustrators [[Anna Höglund]] and [[Mati Lepp]].

==Career==
Stark was born and grew up in [[Stureby]], [[Stockholm Municipality]], which place features in several of his books. Stark's interest in writing started early; during his time at [[secondary school]] he was introduced to  writing by his classmate [[Peter Curman]], and in 1964 he wrote his first [[poetry]] ''[[Ett hål till livet]]''. Following this, Stark's interest in writing for a career was greatly encouraged.

Stark died on 13 June 2017 at the age of 72 after suffering from cancer.

The '''Veps language''' (also known as '''Vepsian''', natively as ''vepsän kel’, vepsän keli,'' or ''vepsä''), spoken by the [[Vepsians]] (also known as ''Veps''), belongs to the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] group of the [[Uralic languages]].  Closely related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Karelian language|Karelian]], Veps is also written using Latin script.

According to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] statistics, 12,500 people were self-designated ethnic Veps at the end of 1989.

According to the location of the people, the language is divided into three main [[dialect]]s: '''Northern Veps''' (at [[Lake Onega]] to the south of [[Petrozavodsk]], to the north of the river [[Svir River|Svir]], including the former [[Veps National Volost]]), '''Central Veps''' (in the [[Saint Petersburg]] region and [[Vologda Oblast]]), and '''Southern Veps''' (in the [[Saint Petersburg]] region). The Northern dialect seems the most distinct of the three; however, it is still mutually intelligible for speakers of the other two dialects. Speakers of the Northern dialect call themselves "Ludi" (''lüdikad''), or ''lüdilaižed''.

In [[Russia]], more than 350 children learn the Vepsian language in a total of 5 national schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.karelia.ru/News/2004/12/1209_03_e.html|title=09.12.2004 - The Vepsian Culture Society in Karelia celebrates its 15th anniversary|work=gov.karelia.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification and history==

[[File:Veps language and VepKar corpus by Nina Zaitseva 2018.webm|thumb|thumbtime=106|Nina Zaitseva speaks about the Veps language and the [http://dictorpus.krc.karelia.ru/en VepKar corpus]. See subtitles in Veps language. [[Karelian Research Centre of RAS|KarRC RAS]], 2018.]]

[[File:Flag of Vepsia.svg|thumb|Flag of the Vepsian people]]

Veps is the easternmost surviving member of the Finnic languages. Having developed in relative isolation, the language lacks several features found in its relatives, such as [[consonant gradation]] and the [[length (phonetics)|length]] contrast in consonants. Original vowel length has mostly been lost as well (with the exception of Northern Veps, which retains ''ii'' and ''uu''). At the same time, it retains a number of archaic features.

The closest relative of Veps is [[Ludic language|Ludic]], connecting Veps to the wider Finnic dialect continuum.

Veps also shows some characteristic innovations such as the vocalization of original syllable-final{{nbsp}}*l, and the expansion of the local case system.

==Dialects==
Veps shows substantial dialectal variation, affecting both phonetics and grammatical features. Three main dialect areas can be distinguished, the northern, central and southern dialects.

===Northern===
Northern Veps is spoken in the [[Republic of Karelia]] along the coast of [[Lake Onega]] south of [[Petrozavodsk]]. It is also spoken in a few small villages in [[Leningrad Oblast]]. Villages speaking Northern Veps include [[Shyoltozero]], [[Rybreka]], and [[Kvartsitny]], as well as the city of Petrozavodsk itself.

Characteristics of Northern Veps are:
* Diphthongs are either preserved in their historical form (''koume''), or the first component is raised (''jaug'' [jɑʊ̯g] &gt; ''d'oug'').
* Combinations of vowel + ''l'' are usually preserved (''tal'v'' [tɑlʲv], ''velg'', ''sild'', ''sil'm'' [silʲm], ''olda'', ''sül'g''' [sylʲgʲ], ''pölvaz'' [ˡpølvaz]), rarely vocalized to diphthongs: ''al'' &gt; ''au'', ''el'', ''il'', ''ül'' [yl], ''öl'' [øl]&gt; ''üu'' [yw] and ''ol'' &gt; ''uu'' uː].
* ''l'', ''n'', ''r'' are always palatalized before ''e'' in a non-initial syllable.
* Word-final consonants are not palatalized after ''i'', in for example the past indicative, the conditional and some case forms.
* Long close vowels are retained, with ''*üü'' [yː] often diphthongized to ''üu'' (''*püü'' &gt; ''püu'', contrast Southern and Central Veps ''pü'').
* ''j'' is [[Fortition|fortified]] to ''d&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' [dʲ] word-initially, and medially after consonants (''jaug'' &gt; ''d'oug'' [dʲoʊ̯gː], ''jogi'' &gt; ''d'ogi'' [dʲogi], ''järv'' &gt; ''d'ärv'' dʲærv], ''agj'' &gt; ''agd&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'').
* The last consonant of the stem is lengthened in the third-person singular present indicative (''küzub'' &gt; ''küzzub'', ''tapab'' &gt; ''tappab''), and stem-final ''e'' becomes ''o'' (''lugeb'' &gt; ''luggob'').
* Only traces of vowel harmony are retained.

===Central===
Central Veps dialects are rather distinct from each other compared to Northern and Southern Veps, which are relatively homogeneous. They are spoken around a long line stretching from [[Tervenichey]] in the [[Lodeinopolsky District]] of Leningrad Oblast, to near [[Lake Beloye (Vologda Oblast)|Lake Beloye]]. The largest locality speaking Central Veps dialects is [[Vinnitsy]].

Characteristics of Central Veps are:
* Diphthongs are usually modified (''sain'' &gt; ''sein&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', ''söi'' &gt; ''süi'').
* Combinations of vowel + ''l'' are vocalized to diphthongs in Kuya and Pondala ([[Belozersk]]), and usually preserved elsewhere (''edel'', ''sil'm'', ''sül'kta'', ''völ'').
* ''al'' and ''el'' are vocalized to ''ou'' or ''uu'' (''el'' may also become ''üu'') in the adessive and ablative case forms (''talvel'' &gt; ''touvuu'' or ''touvüu, ''mägelpäi'' &gt; ''mäguupei'').
* Word-final consonants are palatalized after ''i'' (''mänid'' &gt; ''mänid&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', ''mänižin'' &gt; ''mänižin&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'').
* In Kuya village, the vowel in the allative ending depends on the preceding stem vowel. After ''i'' the ending is ''-le'' (''kanoile''), after ''a'' it is ''-la'' (''kalala'') and after other vowels it is ''-lo'' (''lebulo'').
* ''j'' is preserved in most dialects, mostly in the west (''jono'', ''agj''). ''j'' is fortified to ''d&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' in Kuya (''d'ono'', ''agd&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''). It is fortified to ''g&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' in Pondala, Voylahta, Nemzha, and Shimozero (''g'ono'', ''agg&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'').
* [[Final obstruent devoicing]] in Kuya Veps (''sanub'' &gt; ''sanup'', ''vellesed'' &gt; ''velleset'').
* Unrounding of ''ü'' and ''ö'' in a few villages (''pühä'' &gt; ''pihä'', ''pökoi'' &gt; ''pekoi'').
* ''ä'' &gt; ''e'' in Shimozero&lt;!-- also "ladvinskikh" dialects, whatever that is --&gt; (''päiv'' &gt; ''pei(v)'').
* Vowel harmony is weakly preserved, most prominently in the eastern and south-western areas.

===Southern===
Southern Veps is spoken in the [[Boksitogorsky District]] of Leningrad Oblast, including the villages of [[Radogoshcha]] and [[Sidorovo]].

Characteristics of Southern Veps are:
* Diphthongs are monophtongized to long vowels, especially in non-initial syllables (''pertišpäi'' &gt; ''pertišpää'', ''heboine'' &gt; ''heboone''&lt;!-- [the source also gives this, but doesn't say what the original form is], ''rikoomaa''--&gt;).
* Combinations of vowel + ''l'' are usually preserved.
* ''al'' and ''el'' are vocalized to ''aa'' and ''oo'' in the adessive and ablative case forms (''tal'vel'' &gt; ''tal'voo'', ''kezal'' &gt; ''kezaa'').
* ''l'' and ''n'' are palatalized before ''e'' non-initial syllables when followed by a case ending or person-and-number ending. ''r'' is not palatalized.
* Word-final consonants are palatalized after ''i'', in for example the past indicative, the conditional and some case forms.
* ''j'' is preserved (''jogi'', ''jüged'').
* Unrounding of front rounded vowels, ''ü'' &gt; ''i'' (''pühä'' &gt; ''pihä'') and ''ö'' &gt; ''e''.
* The ending ''-i'' of the third-person singular past indicative is usually dropped, leaving palatalization of the preceding consonant (''pästi'' &gt; ''päst&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', ''väti'' &gt; ''vät&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', ''kolkati'' &gt; ''kolkat&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'').
* Vowel harmony is preserved well (''höblötädä'', ''pörüdä'', ''södä'').

====Palatalization====
In general, palatalizable consonants are palatalized [[Allophone|allophonically]] before a front vowel. However, palatalized consonants also occur in other environments, especially in word-final position or in word-final clusters.

There are some cases where the front vowel {{IPA|/i/}} is preceded by a non-palatalized consonant. In native Finnic vocabulary, this occurs where inflectional endings beginning with {{IPA|/i/}} are attached to words with a stem ending in a non-palatalized consonant. The consonant is not palatalized by {{IPA|/i/}} in this case, but remains non-palatalized by analogy with the other inflected forms. The vowel {{IPA|/i/}} is backed to {{IPA|[ɨ]}} in this case, as in Russian, making it unclear whether the palatalization is a consequence of the front vowel, or the backing is the result of the lack of palatalization. Either analysis is possible.

Compare:
* ''nor&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' {{IPA|/norʲ/}} ("young"), genitive singular ''noren'' {{IPA|/norʲen/}}, partitive plural ''norid'' {{IPA|/norʲid/}}
* ''nor'' {{IPA|/nor/}} ("rope"), genitive singular ''noran'' {{IPA|/norɑn/}}, partitive plural ''norid'' {{IPA|/norid/}} (or {{IPA|/norɨd/}})

Russian loanwords have also introduced instances of non-palatalized consonants followed by {{IPA|/i/}}, which are much more frequent in that language.

===Vowels===
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
|-
|+ Vowel phonemes of Veps&lt;ref&gt;Грамматика вепсского языка (page 17), M. I. Zaitseva, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;
! rowspan="2" |
! colspan="2" | [[Front vowel|Front]]
! rowspan="2" | [[Central vowel|Central]]
! rowspan="2" | [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! [[Unrounded vowel|Unr.]]
! [[Rounded vowel|Rnd.]]
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA link|i}}
| {{IPA link|y}}
| ({{IPA link|ɨ}})
| {{IPA link|u}}
|-

|
| {{IPA link|o̞|o}}
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| {{IPA link|æ}}
|
|
| {{IPA link|ɑ}}
|}

The status of {{IPA|/ɨ/}} is marginal; it occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/i/}} after a non-palatalized consonant. See above under "Palatalization" for more information. It does not occur in the first syllable of a word.

====Vowel harmony====

Like many other Finnic languages, Veps has [[vowel harmony]] but in a much more limited form. Words are split into back-vowel and front-vowel words based on which vowels they contain:

* Back vowels: {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}
* Front vowels: {{IPA|/æ/}}, {{IPA|/ø/}} and {{IPA|/y/}}

However, the front vowels can only occur in the first two syllables of a word. In a third or later syllable, and also sometimes in the second syllable, they are converted to the corresponding back vowel. Thus, vowel harmony only applies (inconsistently) in the second syllable, and has been lost elsewhere. It is not applied for inflectional endings except in a few exceptional cases, but is retained more frequently in derivational endings.

For example:
* ''korged'' ("high", back-vowel harmony), genitive singular ''korkt'''a'''n'', derived noun ''korkt'''u'''z&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' ("height"); compare Finnish ''korke'''a''''', ''korke'''u'''s''.
* ''pimed'' ("dark", back-vowel harmony), genitive singular ''pimed'''a'''n'', derived noun ''pimed'''u'''z&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' ("darkness"); compare Finnish ''pime'''ä''''', ''pime'''y'''s''.
* ''hüv'''ä''''' ("good", front-vowel harmony), illative singular ''hüv'''ä'''h'''a''''', derived noun ''hüv'''ü'''z&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' ("goodness"); compare Finnish ''hyv'''ää'''n''. ''hyv'''yy'''s''.
* ''päiv'' ("day", front-vowel harmony), genitive singular ''päiv'''ä'''n'', illative singular ''päivh'''a'''n''; compare Finnish ''päiv'''ä''''', ''päiv'''ää'''n''.
* ''pä'' ("head", back-vowel harmony), illative singular ''päh'''a'''''; compare Finnish ''pääh'''ä'''n''.
* ''kez'''a''''' ("summer", back-vowel harmony); compare Finnish ''kes'''ä'''''.
* ''väv'''u''''' ("son-in-law", back-vowel harmony); compare Finnish ''väv'''y'''''.
* ''üld'''ü'''d'''a''''' ("to rise", front-vowel harmony in second syllable, back-vowel in third); compare Finnish ''ylt'''yä'''''.
* ''küz'''u'''d'''a''''' ("to ask", back-vowel harmony); compare Finnish ''kys'''yä'''''.

==Orthography==
The modern Vepsian alphabet is a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The government of the Republic of Karelia approved the Veps language alphabet|url=http://gov.karelia.ru/News/2007/04/0417_06_e.html|accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a total of twenty-nine characters: twenty-two are from the [[basic modern Latin alphabet]], six are derived from basic Latin letters by the addition of [[diacritical marks]], and the final character is the apostrophe, which signifies [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of the preceding sound.

Veps orthography is largely phonemic, and represents each phoneme with one letter. Palatalized consonants are single phonemes, and thus the combination of a letter and a following apostrophe is a single combined letter for this purpose.

Palatalization of consonants before front vowels is not indicated in the orthography, so plain consonant letters can represent both types of consonant depending on what vowel follows. For a following letter {{angbr|i}}, this is ambiguous, however: it can be preceded by both types of consonants, as noted above in the phonology section. Whether a consonant before the letter {{angbr|i}} is palatalized or not cannot be determined from the orthography and must be learned for each word.

==Grammar==
[[File:Veps bukvar.jpg|thumb|250px|A Soviet textbook for native speakers of Veps printed in the 1930s]]
Like other Finnic languages, Veps is an [[agglutinating]] language. The preservation of the Proto-Finnic weak-grade consonants ''*d'' and ''*g'' in all positions, along with the loss of consonant gradation, has made Veps morphology relatively simple compared to the other Finnic languages. There are fewer inflectional classes, and inflections of nominals and verbs alike can be predicted from only a few basic [[principal parts]].

===Nouns===
Veps has twenty-three [[grammatical case]]s, more than any other [[Finnic languages|Finnic language]]. It preserves the basic set of Finnic cases shared by most Finnic languages, including the [[Proto-Finnic locative system|six locative cases]], but several more cases have been added that generally have no counterpart in the others.

Notes:
# "V" indicates a copy of whatever vowel the genitive singular stem ends with, replacing a ''i'', ''ä'', ''ö'', ''ü'' with ''e'', ''a'', ''o'', ''u''. For example, for the illative singular: ''mec'''a'''n'' &gt; ''mech'''a''''', ''nor'''e'''n'' &gt; ''nor'''e'''h'''e''''', ''pöud'''o'''n'' &gt; ''pöudh'''o''''', ''p'''ä'''n'' &gt; ''p'''ä'''h'''a'''''. Note that the stem-final vowel itself can disappear in these forms, but the rule applies the same.
# In endings beginning with ''s'' or ''z'' or a group of consonants containing ''s'' or ''z'', this changes to ''š''/''ž'' if the last preceding vowel is ''i''. This always occurs in the plural forms.
# The partitive, allative, terminative II, additive II and prolative singular cases have longer endings that are used with a few frequently-used pronouns, ''ken'' "who" and ''mi'' "what".

====Principal parts====

Nouns have four [[principal part]]s, from which all other noun forms can be derived by replacing the endings:
* Nominative singular: Forms no other forms.
* Partitive singular: Forms the prolative singular. Can usually be formed from the genitive singular by replacing ''-n'' with ''-d'', but some words have an unpredictable form with ''-t'' and a different stem.
* Genitive singular: When ''-n'' is removed, forms all remaining singular forms, and the nominative and accusative plural.
* Illative singular: Forms the illative, terminative I and additive I singular. The illative singular is predictably formed from the genitive singular stem, so it's not a principal part as such.
* Partitive plural: When ''-d'' is removed, forms all remaining plural forms.


The illative singular stem is the same as the genitive singular stem, except that the final vowel is dropped in some cases. The vowel is retained if ''at least one'' of these is the case, and dropped otherwise:
# The final vowel is a diphthong.
# The nominative singular is of the form "consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel".
# The genitive singular has 1 or 3 syllables.
# There is contraction of a syllable in the genitive singular stem (compared to the nominative stem), e.g. nom sg ''vauged'' &gt; gen sg ''vauktan'' (contraction ''-ged'' &gt; ''-kt-''), nom sg ''lambaz'' &gt; gen sg ''lambhan'' (contraction ''-az'' &gt; ''-h-'').
# The final consonants of genitive singular stem are ''ll'' or ''&lt;nowiki&gt;l'l'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.

* Second infinitive in ''-de-'' or ''-te-'' with inessive or instructive case endings.
* Third infinitive in ''-ma-'' with inessive, illative, elative, adessive or abessive case endings.

Participles:
* Present active participle in ''-i'' (stem ''-ja-''). This is the same suffix as is used for agent nouns.
* Past active participle in ''-nu'' (stem ''-nude-'').
* Past passive participle in ''-dud'' or ''-tud''.

The original Finnic present active participle is falling out of use, and is preserved only for a few verbs, as ''-b'' (stem ''-ba-'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2168">'''Victorinus Bythner''' ({{lang-pl|Wiktoryn Bythner}}) (c.1605–c.1670) was a Polish Hebraist, grammarian and university teacher in England.

==Life==
He was born in [[Głębowice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Głębowice]], the son of a Calvinist theologian, Bartholomäus Bythner; his father held [[Calvinistic]] views. His brother [[Jan Bythner]] was a notable theologian. He studied at the [[University of Frankfurt an der Oder]], and then at the [[University of Groningen]] under [[Franciscus Gomarus]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=4287|first=Page|last=Life|title=Bythner, Victorinus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bythner became a member of the [[University of Oxford]] about 1635, and lectured on the Hebrew language in the refectory at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] until the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War]]. When Charles I fixed the headquarters of his army at Oxford in 1643, Bythner moved to Cambridge.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Bythner, Victorinus|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Bythner lived in London, but in 1651 was again lecturer on Hebrew at Oxford. About 1664 he went to [[Cornwall]], where he practised medicine. The date of his death is unknown.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Bythner's grammatical works were written in Latin: his Hebrew grammar, published in 1638 as ''Lingua Eruditorum'', was several times reprinted. An edition of this work was published by [[James Hessey]] in 1853, with the author's ''Institutio Chaldaica'' (first printed in 1650). Bythner's other major work was ''Lyra Prophetica Davidis Regis'' (London, 1650), a grammatical analysis of the vocabulary of the Hebrew psalms. An English translation of this book, by Thomas Dee, was published in 1836, with a second edition in 1847 that was revised by [[Nathan Lazarus Benmohel]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

A '''village green''' is a [[commons|common]] open area within a [[village]] or other settlement. Traditionally, a village green was common [[pasture|grassland]] at the centre of a rural settlement used for grazing with a pond for watering cattle and other stock.

The village green also provided, and may still provide, an open-air meeting place for the local people, which may be used for public celebrations such as [[May Day]] festivities. The term is used more broadly to encompass woodland, moorland, sports grounds, buildings and roads.

==History==
[[File:House on Village Green, Melmerby - geograph.org.uk - 236245.jpg|thumb|Village green&lt;br /&gt;[[Melmerby, Cumbria]]]]
[[File:Stanford in the Vale village green (2002).jpg|thumb|The village green in [[Stanford in the Vale]], [[Oxfordshire]]]]
[[File:Pritzhagen 07.jpg|thumb|A large green in the village of Pritzhagen, Germany]]
Some historical village greens have been lost as a result of the [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] and [[urbanization|urban development]]. Greens are now most likely to be found in the older villages of mainland Europe, the United Kingdom, and older areas of the United States. Town expansion in the mid-20th century led in England to the formation of local [[conservation ethic|conservation]] societies, often centring on village green preservation, as celebrated and parodied in [[The Kinks]]' album ''[[The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society]]''. The [[Open Spaces Society]] is a present-day UK national campaigning body which continues this movement.

The term may apply to [[urban park]]s. In the United States, the most famous example{{cn|date=March 2017}} of a town green is probably the [[New Haven Green]] in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]. New Haven was founded by settlers from England and was the first planned city in the United States. Originally used for grazing livestock, the Green dates from the 1630s and is well preserved today despite lying at the heart of [[downtown New Haven|the city centre]]. The largest green in the U.S. is a mile in length, and can be found in [[Lebanon, Connecticut]]. One of the most unusual is the [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] Green in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], which was owned and cleared by the college in 1770. The college, not the town, still owns it and surrounded it with buildings as a sort of collegiate quadrangle in the 1930s, although its origin as a town green remains apparent.
A fine example of a traditional American town green exists in downtown [[Morristown, NJ]]. The [[Morristown Green]] dates from 1715 and has hosted events ranging from executions to clothing drives.

Apart from the general use of the term, ''village green'' has a specific legal meaning in England and Wales, and also includes the less common term ''town green''. Town and village greens were defined in the [[Commons Registration Act 1965]], as amended by the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]], as land:
# which has been allotted by or under any Act for the exercise or recreation of the inhabitants of any locality
# or on which the inhabitants of any locality have a customary right to indulge in lawful sports and pastimes
# or if it is land on which for not fewer than twenty years a significant number of the inhabitants of any locality, or of any neighbourhood within a locality, have indulged in lawful sports and pastimes as of right.

Registered greens are now governed by the [[Commons Act 2006]], but the fundamental test of whether land is a town and village green remains the same. Thus land can become a village green if it has been used for twenty years without force, secrecy or request (''nec vi, nec clam, nec precario'').&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the law on this, see Austen-Baker, R. and Mayfield, B.,"Uncommon Confusion: Parallel Jurisprudence in Town and Village Green Applications" [2012] Conveyancer 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Village green legislation is often used to try to frustrate development. Recent case law (''Oxfordshire County Council vs Oxford City Council and Robinson'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/25.html |title=Oxfordshire County Council v. Oxford City Council &amp; Ors (2005) and others [2006&amp;#93; UKHL 25 (24 May 2006) |publisher=Bailii.org |accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes it clear that registration as a green would render any development which prevented continuing use of the green as a criminal activity under the [[Inclosure Act 1857]] and the [[Commons Act 1876]]. This leads to some most curious areas being claimed as village greens, sometimes with success. Recent examples include a bandstand,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iwight.com/council/committees/Human%20Resources%20and%20Misc%20Appeals/1-9-06/Paper%20B.htm&lt;/ref&gt; two lakes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-14043544 |title= Llyn Maelog lake on Anglesey given village green status |author= |date=7 July 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a beach.&lt;ref&gt;[2013] EWCA Civ 276&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Open Spaces Society]] states that in 2005 there were about 3,650 registered greens in England covering {{convert|8150|acres|0|abbr=on}} and about 220 in [[Wales]] covering about {{convert|620|acres|0|abbr=on}}.

[[File:The large green village of Zuidlaren.JPG|thumb|A village green in Zuidlaren, [[Netherlands]]]]

A notable example of a village green is that in the village of [[Finchingfield]] in Essex, England, which is said {{who|date=November 2012}} to be "the most photographed village in England". The green dominates the village, and slopes down to a duck pond, and is occasionally flooded after heavy rain. The small village of [[Car Colston]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], England, has two village greens, totaling 29 acres (12 ha).&lt;ref&gt;Good Pub Guide [http://www.thegoodpubguide.co.uk/pub/view/Royal-Oak-NG13-8JE Retrieved 2 April 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some greens that used to be a common or otherwise at the centre of a village have been swallowed up by a city growing around them. Sometimes they become a city park or a square, and manage to maintain a sense of place. London has several of these: [[Newington Green]] is a good example, with [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] anchoring the northern end.

There are two places in the United States called Village Green: [[Village Green-Green Ridge, Pennsylvania]], and [[Village Green, New York]]. Some [[New England]] towns, along with some areas settled by New Englanders such as the townships in the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]], refer to their [[town square]] as a village green. The village green of Bedford, New York, is preserved as part of [[Bedford Village Historic District]]. The only village green in the United States still used for agriculture lies in [[Lebanon, Connecticut]]. This green is also one of the largest in the nation.

In [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Java]], a similar place is called ''Alun-Alun''. It is a central part of Javanese village architecture and culture.

The northern part of the province of [[Drenthe]] in the [[Netherlands]] is also known for its village greens. [[Zuidlaren]] is the village with the largest number of village greens in the Netherlands.

The [[Błonia Park]], originally established in the Middle Ages, is an example of a large village green in [[Kraków]], Poland.
