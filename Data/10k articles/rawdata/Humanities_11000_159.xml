[[Image:Achille Talon cover.jpg|230px|thumb|Cover of ''L'Archipel de Sanzunron'' (''The Notapenny Archipelago'')]]
'''''Achille Talon''''' is a [[Franco-Belgian comics]] series featuring an [[eponymous]] main character, created by [[Greg (comics)|Greg]] (the pseudonym of Michel Regnier).  Starting publication in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Pilote]]'' in 1963, the series presents the comic misadventures of an [[anti-hero]].

The name derives from ''"talon d'Achille"'', the French term for an "[[Achilles' heel]]", which suits the character although the Achilles' heel of Achille Talon is not his heel but his large nose.

==Publication history==
The first ''Achille Talon'' gag was published in ''Pilote'' on November 7, 1963.&lt;ref name="BDO-P1963"&gt;{{Cite web|last=BDoubliées|title=Pilote année 1963|url=http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/annees/1963.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years of gags and increasing popularity, ''Achille Talon'' became a dedicated magazine of its own, starting publication on October 1, 1975.&lt;ref name="BDO-P1975"&gt;{{Cite web|last=BDoubliées|title=Pilote année 1975|url=http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/annees/1975.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not achieving the intended success, the magazine ceased publication after one year, producing only six issues.&lt;ref name="dupuis"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Dupuis |title=Greg |url=http://www.dupuis.com/servlet/jpecat?AUTEUR_ID=168&amp;lang=UK&amp;pgm=VIEW_AUTHOR |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004506/http://www.dupuis.com/servlet/jpecat?pgm=VIEW_AUTHOR&amp;lang=UK&amp;AUTEUR_ID=168 |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[comics album|album]] series has produced 46 volumes. Achille Talon is presented in two quite different formats: there are album length stories such as ''Achille Talon et la main du serpent'' (''Achille Talon and the Serpent's Hand''), a 44-page story, as well as albums with only gags that run one or two pages each. Regardless of format, Achille Talon would typically first appear a couple pages at a time in the weekly magazine ''Pilote'', then be collected later for hardcover or softcover books.

== Characters ==
Achille Talon is a ''[[bourgeois]]'' who likes to think he's an eloquent (others say [[wikt:voluble|voluble]]) [[intellectual]]. He is vain to the extent that he builds a giant statue of himself in his front garden and desperately tries to get on the good side of the local gentry. That being said, Achille Talon is a gentleman, an intrepid traveler and an animal lover. He values [[etiquette]] and sometimes resorts to activism (e.g., pro peace or against pollution) or inventions. He is often at odds with his neighbour Hilarion Lefuneste, who loves to argue too. (In French, ''le funeste'' means "the grievous/fateful one" suggesting any dealings with him will have negative consequences.)

A man in his forties, Achille is single and lives at home with his parents. His father, Alambic Dieudonné Corydon Talon, is a beer-fanatic, while his mother, unnamed but always "maman", is a strong, earthy, loving bourgeois housewife. He never tires of the attentions of the aristocratic Virgule de Guillemets, who brings sophistication to his life.

Achille Talon can be courageous and magnanimous, a protector of animals and ever vigilant guardian of proper etiquette, so much so that he fights with an author of an etiquette book — over which of them has the honour of giving the right of way. He is a patron of the arts (as long as he is the one portrayed) and briefly a wise, though ostensibly tyrannical, head of state.

==Device==

On a page verbal and visual humor are usually  mixed, although sometimes the humour is strictly visual, sometimes mostly verbal. The visual humor is often from exaggeration (phones often do not simply ring, but explode), however occasionally it is subtle and understated (a factory spewing out toxic fumes, bearing a sign "Gourmet Foods", or a funnel in the soil of an overflowing pot, where watering with any tool could hardly miss).

The verbal humour usually consists of long rants, in which internal inconsistencies, puns and sheer nonsense are cleverly interspersed. Of course, Achille Talon is almost invariably proven wrong and ends up being the butt of the joke.

== Typical quotes ==

* "Bof" or "Hop" are his favorite interjections, especially if things do not turn out as expected. "Bof!" is the verbal equivalent of the Gaulish shrug, rather like "Whatever!"
* "After careful consideration of the facts, I've decided to faint. It may not be very heroic, but it is relaxing. Therefore, ''zzzzz''."

==Translation into English==
In 1981, Dargaud Canada translated ''Le Trésor de Virgule'' into English as ''Magnesia's Treasure''. Achille Talon was translated into ''Walter Melon'', presumably a pun on "watermelon". The paperback volume included two features not included in the French original: a page introducing the characters (similar to the opening of ''[[Asterix]]'' books), and a humorous three page illustrated essay on Greg and the publishing industry in general. The back cover is the familiar picture of Talon leaning out of a newsstand snagging Lefuneste, with a small inset with a photograph of Greg titled "AUTHOR AND GENIUS", followed by a quote "SUCCESS DID NOT SPOIL ME. I WAS BORN SPOILED."

==Television adaptation==
A television series of fifty-two twenty-six-minute episodes was made for [[Canal+]] in 1996 by [[Saban International Paris]]. Each episode is broken up into two short stories. It was broadcast in [[France]] for the first time on September 3, 1997, in the television show ''C + Cléo'' on Canal+.

The animated series is very different from the original comic. In the animated cartoon, Talon is a very awkward superhero who offers his heroic services for hire, replacing such characters as [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Zorro]] and [[Tarzan]] when they become indisposed. Talon manages to make justice triumph by pure luck. The series was renamed ''[[Walter Melon (TV series)|Walter Melon]]'' for English-speaking television. The English version was broadcast on the [[Fox Family Channel]].

{{Airstream mechanism}}
In [[phonetics]], the '''airstream mechanism''' is the method by which airflow is created in the [[vocal tract]]. Along with [[phonation]] and [[articulation (phonetics)|articulation]], it is one of three main components of speech production. The airstream mechanism is mandatory for sound production and constitutes the first part of this process, which is called initiation.

The organ generating the airstream is called the ''initiator'' and there are three initiators used in spoken human languages:
* the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] together with the ribs and lungs ''(pulmonic'' mechanisms),
* the [[glottis]] ''(glottalic'' mechanisms), and
* the [[tongue]] ''(lingual'' or ''"velaric"'' mechanisms).

Though not used in any language, the [[cheek]]s may be used to generate the airstream ''(buccal'' mechanism, notated {ↀ} in [[VoQS]]). See [[buccal speech]].

After a laryngectomy, the [[esophagus]] may be used as the initiator (notated {Œ} for simple esophageal speech and {Ю} for tracheo-esophageal speech in VoQS).  See [[esophageal speech]].

''Percussive'' consonants are produced without any airstream mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pike|first1=Kenneth|title=Phonetics|date=1943|publisher=Michigan|pages=103–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of airstream mechanism==

Any of the three initiators − diaphragm, glottis or tongue − may act by either increasing or decreasing the pressure generating the airstream. These changes in pressure often correspond to outward and inward airflow, and are therefore termed ''[[Egressive sound|egressive]]'' and ''[[Ingressive speech|ingressive]]'' respectively.

Of these six resulting airstream mechanisms, four are found lexically around the world:
* ''[[Pulmonic consonant|pulmonic]] egressive,'' where the air is pushed out of the lungs by the ribs and [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]]. All human languages employ such sounds (such as vowels), and nearly three out of four use them exclusively.
* ''[[Glottalic consonant|glottalic]] egressive,'' where the air column is compressed as the [[glottis]] moves upward. Such consonants are called [[ejective consonant|ejectives]]. Ejective and ejective-like consonants occur in 16% of the languages.
* ''glottalic ingressive,'' where the air column is rarefied as the glottis moves downward. Such consonants are called [[implosive consonant|implosives]]. Implosive and implosive-like consonants occur in 13% of the world's languages. Despite the name, the airstream may not actually flow inward: While the glottis moves downward, pulmonic air passes outward through it, but the reduction in pressure makes an audible difference to the sound. 
* ''lingual ingressive,'' &lt;small&gt;AKA&lt;/small&gt; ''velaric ingressive,'' where the air in the mouth is rarefied by a downward movement of the tongue. These are the [[click consonant]]s. Clicks are regular sounds in ordinary words in fewer than 2% of the world's languages, all in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Maddieson (2008) "Presence of Uncommon Consonants". In: Martin Haspelmath &amp; Matthew S. Dryer &amp; David Gil &amp; Bernard Comrie (eds.) ''The World Atlas of Language Structures Online.'' Munich: Max Planck Digital Library, chapter 19. Available online at http://wals.info/feature/19. Accessed on 18 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

These mechanisms may be combined into airstream [[Contour (linguistics)|contours]], such as clicks which release into ejectives.

The [[Khoisan languages]] have pulmonic, ejective, and click consonants, the [[Chadic languages]] have pulmonic, implosive, and ejective consonants, and the [[Nguni languages]] utilize all four, pulmonic, click, implosive, and ejective, in normal vocabulary. Most other languages utilize only one or two airstream mechanisms.

In [[interjection]]s, the other two mechanisms may be employed. For example, in countries as diverse as Sweden, Turkey, and Togo, a pulmonic ingressive ("gasped" or "inhaled") vowel is used for [[backchannel (linguistics)|back-channeling]] or to express agreement, and in France a lingual egressive (a "spurt") is used to express dismissal. The only language where such sounds are known to be contrastive in normal vocabulary is the extinct ritual language [[Damin]] (also the only language outside Africa with clicks); however, Damin appears to have been intentionally designed to differ from normal speech.

==Pulmonic initiation==
Initiation by means of the [[lung]]s (actually the diaphragm and ribs) is called '''pulmonic''' initiation. The vast majority of sounds used in human languages are [[pulmonic egressive]]s. In most languages, including all the languages of Europe (excluding the [[languages of the Caucasus|Caucasus]]), all [[phoneme]]s are pulmonic egressives.

The only attested use of a phonemic pulmonic ingressive is a lateral fricative in [[Damin]], a ritual language formerly used by speakers of [[Lardil language|Lardil]] in [[Australia]]. This can be written with the extended version of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] as {{IPA|[ɬ↓]}}. [[!Xóõ language|!Xóõ]] has ingression as a phonetic detail in one series of its clicks, which are ''ingressive voiceless nasals with delayed aspiration'', {{IPA|[↓ŋ̊ʘʰ ↓ŋ̊ǀʰ ↓ŋ̊ǁʰ ↓ŋ̊!ʰ ↓ŋ̊ǂʰ]}}. [[Peter Ladefoged]] considers these to be among the most difficult sounds in the world. Other languages, for example in [[Taiwan]], have been claimed to have pulmonic ingressives, but these claims have either proven to be spurious or to be occasional phonetic detail.

In [[interjection]]s, but not in normal words, pulmonic ingressive vowels or words occur on all continents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ingressivespeech.info/ Robert Eklund]&lt;/ref&gt; This is commonly done for [[Backchannel (linguistics)|back-channeling]] (as with {{IPA|[ə↓]}} in [[Ewe language|Ewe]]) or affirmation (as with {{IPA|[ɸʷ↓]}} in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]). In English, an audible intake of breath, {{IPA|[hːː↓]}}, or an indrawn consonant such as {{IPA|[tʰ↓]}} or {{IPA|[p͡t↓]}} is used in a conversation to indicate that someone is about to speak or is preparing to continue speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden (2009) ''An Introduction to English Phonetics'', p. 9, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In some languages, such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Amharic language|Amharic]], entire phrases may be uttered with an ingressive airstream. (See [[ingressive sound]].)

==Glottalic initiation==

It is possible to initiate airflow in the upper vocal tract by means of the vocal cords or [[glottis]]. This is known as '''glottalic''' initiation.

For egressive glottalic initiation, one lowers the glottis (as if to sing a low note), closes it as for a [[glottal stop]], and then raises it, building up pressure in the oral cavity and upper [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Glottalic egressives are called '''[[ejective]]s'''. The glottis must be fully closed to form glottalic egressives, or the air column would flow backwards over it; it is therefore impossible to pronounce [[phonation|voiced]] ejectives. Ejective allophones of voiceless stops occur in many varieties of English at the ends of [[intonation unit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

For ingressive glottalic initiation, the sequence of actions performed in glottalic pressure initiation is reversed:  one raises the glottis (as if to sing a high note), closes it, and then lowers it to create suction in the upper trachea and oral cavity. Glottalic ingressives are called '''[[implosive consonant|implosive]]s''', although they may involve zero airflow rather than actual inflow. Because the air column would flow forwards over the descending glottis, it is not necessary to fully close it, and implosives may be voiced; indeed, voiceless implosives are exceedingly rare.

It is usual for implosives to be voiced. Instead of keeping the glottis tightly closed, it is tensed but left slightly open to allow a thin stream of air through. Unlike pulmonic voiced sounds, in which a stream of air passes through a usually-fixed glottis, in voiced implosives a mobile glottis passes over a nearly motionless air column to cause vibration of the vocal cords. [[Phonation]]s that are more open than modal voice, such as breathy voice, are not conducive to glottalic sounds because in these the glottis is held relatively open, allowing air to readily flow through and preventing a significant pressure difference from building up behind the articulator.

Because the oral cavity is so much smaller than the lungs, [[vowel]]s and [[approximant]]s cannot be pronounced with glottalic initiation. So-called [[glottalization|glottalized]] vowels and other sonorants use the more common pulmonic egressive airstream mechanism.

There is no clear divide between pulmonic and glottalic sounds. Some languages may have consonants which are intermediate. For example, glottalized consonants in London English, such as the ''t'' in ''rat'' {{IPA|[ˈɹæʔt]}}, may be weakly ejective. Similarly, fully voiced stops in languages such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]], and [[Maidu language|Maidu]] are weakly implosive. This ambiguity does not occur with the next airstream mechanism, lingual, which is clearly distinct from pulmonic sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lingual (velaric) initiation==

The third form of initiation in human language is '''lingual''' or '''velaric''' initiation, where a sound is produced by a closure at two places of articulation, and the airstream is formed by movement of the body of the tongue. Lingual stops are more commonly known as '''[[click consonant|clicks]]''', and are almost universally ingressive. The word ''lingual'' is derived from Latin ''lingua'', which means tongue.

To produce a [[lingual ingressive]] airstream, first close the vocal tract at two places: at the back of the tongue, as in a [[velar consonant|velar]] or [[uvular consonant|uvular]] stop, and simultaneously with the front of the tongue or the lips, as in a [[coronal consonant|coronal]] or [[bilabial]] stop. These holds may be voiceless, voiced, or nasalized. Then lower the body of the tongue to rarefy the air above it. The closure at the front of the tongue is opened first, as the click "release"; then the closure at the back is released for the pulmonic or glottalic click "accompaniment" or "efflux". This may be [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]], [[affricate]]d, or even [[ejective]]. Even when not ejective, it is not uncommon for the glottis to be closed as well, for a triply articulated consonant, and this third closure is released last to produce a glottalized click. Clicks are found in very few languages, notably the [[Khoisan languages]] of southern Africa and some nearby tongues such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. They are more often found in extra-linguistic contexts, such as the "tsk tsk" sound many Westerners use to express regret or pity (a [[dental click]]), or the clucking noise used by many [[equestrianism|equestrians]] to urge on their horses (a [[alveolar lateral click|lateral click]]).

Lingual egressive initiation is performed by reversing the sequence of a lingual ingressive: the front and back of the tongue (or lips and back of the tongue) seal off the vocal cavity, and the cheeks and middle of the tongue move inward and upward to increase oral pressure. The only attested use of a lingual egressive is a bilabial nasal egressive click in [[Damin]]. Transcribing this also requires the use of the Extended IPA, {{IPA|[ŋʘ↑]}}.

Since the air pocket used to initiate lingual consonants is so small, it is not thought to be possible to produce lingual [[fricative consonant|fricative]]s,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} vowels, or other sounds which require continuous airflow.

Clicks may be [[voiced consonant|voiced]], but they are more easily [[nasal consonant|nasalized]]. This may be because the vocal cavity behind the rearmost closure, behind which the air passing through the glottis for voicing must be contained, is so small that clicks cannot be voiced for long. Allowing the airstream to pass through the nose enables a longer production.

Nasal clicks involve a combination of lingual and pulmonic mechanisms. The velum is lowered so as to direct pulmonic airflow through the nasal cavity during the lingual initiation. This nasal airflow may itself be egressive or ingressive, independently of the lingual initiation of the click. Nasal clicks may be voiced, but are very commonly unvoiced and even aspirated, which is rare for purely pulmonic nasals.

==Airstream contours==
In some treatments, complex clicks are posited to have airstream [[contour (linguistics)|contour]]s, in which the airstream changes between the front (click) and rear (non-click) release. There are two attested types: [[Linguo-pulmonic]] consonants, where the rear release is a uvular obstruent such as {{IPA|[q]}} or {{IPA|[χ]}}; and [[linguo-glottalic]] consonants, where the rear release is an ejective such as {{IPA|[qʼ]}} or {{IPA|[qχʼ]}}. Theoretically, a release into an implosive should be possible, but both clicks and dorsal implosives ({{IPA|[ɠ, ʛ&amp;thinsp;]}}) are rare (the latter because they are difficult to pronounce), and no language is known to combine them.

==Percussive consonants==
Consonants may be pronounced without any airstream mechanism. These are ''percussive'' consonants, where the sound is generated by one organ striking another. Percussive consonants are not phonemic in any known language, though the [[extensions to the IPA]] for disordered speech provide symbols for a [[bilabial percussive]] {{IPA|[ʬ]}} (smacking lips) and a [[bidental percussive]] {{IPA|[ʭ]}} (gnashing teeth). The only percussive known to be used in nondisordered speech is a [[sublingual percussive]] {{IPA|[¡]}} (a tongue slap) that appears allophonically in the release of [[alveolar click]]s in the [[Sandawe language]] of Tanzania.

'''Andy Warhol''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɔːr|h|ɒ|l}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]'': [http://www.dictionary.com/browse/warhol "Warhol"]&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Andrew Warhola'''; August 6, 1928&amp;nbsp;– February 22, 1987) was an American artist, director and producer who was a leading figure in the [[Art movement|visual art movement]] known as [[pop art]]. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, [[celebrity culture]], and [[advertising]] that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, [[silkscreening]], photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (1962) and ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' (1962), the experimental film ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966), and the [[multimedia]] events known as the ''[[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]]'' (1966–67).

Born and raised in [[Pittsburgh]], Warhol initially pursued a successful career as a [[commercial illustrator]]. After exhibiting his work in several [[art gallery|galleries]] in the late 1950s, he began to receive recognition as an influential and controversial artist. His [[New York City|New York]] studio, [[The Factory]], became a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished [[intellectual]]s, [[drag queen]]s, playwrights, [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] street people, [[Hollywood]] celebrities, and wealthy patrons.&lt;ref name="NYT-20181112"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Trebay |first1=Guy |last2=La Ferla |first2=Ruth |title=Tales From the Warhol Factory - In each of three successive spaces called the Factory, Andy Warhol created movies, paintings, time capsules and psychosexual dramas with a half-life of many decades.

In the late 1960s, he managed and produced the [[experimental rock]] band [[The Velvet Underground]] and founded ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine. He authored numerous books, including ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]]'' and ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]''. He lived openly as a [[gay]] man before the [[gay liberation|gay liberation movement]]. After [[gallbladder]] [[surgery]], Warhol died of [[cardiac arrhythmia]] in February 1987 at the age of 58.

Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective [[art exhibition|exhibitions]], books, and [[I Shot Andy Warhol|feature]] and documentary films.  [[The Andy Warhol Museum]] in his native city of Pittsburgh, which holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives, is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$105&amp;nbsp;million for a 1963 [[canvas]] titled ''[[Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)]]''; his works include some of the [[List of most expensive paintings|most expensive paintings ever sold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/andy-warhol-painting-sells-105m-article-1.1516240 |title=Andy Warhol painting sells for $105M |work=New York Daily News |date= November 13, 2013|accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 article in ''[[The Economist]]'' described Warhol as the "[[bellwether]] of the art market".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14941229 |title=A special report on the art market: The Pop master's highs and lows |work=The Economist |date= November 26, 2009|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life and beginnings (1928–49)===
[[File:Andy Warhol's childhood home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|left|Warhol's childhood home. 3252 Dawson Street, [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|South Oakland]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania|alt=|267x267px]]
Warhol was born on August 6, 1928, in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warholfoundation.org/legacy/biography.html |title=Andy Warhol: Biography |publisher=Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth child of Ondrej Warhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola, Sr., 1889–1942)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1342249/John-Warhola-dies-aged-85.html  "Elder brother of Andy Warhol, who raised young artist, dies aged 85"], ''Daily Mail'', December 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhola.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Warhola.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Bockris, ''Warhol: The Biography'', Da Capo Press, 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julia Warhola|Julia]] (''née'' Zavacká, 1892–1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhola.com/andysmother.html |title=Mother |publisher=Warhola.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose first child was born in their homeland and died before their move to the U.S.

His parents were working-class [[Lemko]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Robert Magocsi, Ivan Pop, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ovCVDLYN_JgC&amp;pg=PA539 ''Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture''], University of Toronto Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Daggett Dillenberger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KemglT-1jSIC&amp;pg=PA7 Religious Art of Andy Warhol], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; emigrants from [[Miková|Mikó]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (now called Miková, located in today's northeastern [[Slovakia]]). Warhol's father emigrated to the United States in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death of Warhol's grandparents. Warhol's father worked in a coal mine. The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name="Bockris"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Victor |last=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |title=The life and death of Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City |year=1989 |pages=4–5 |isbn=0-553-05708-1 |oclc=19631216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic]] and attended [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]]. Andy Warhol had two older brothers—Pavol (Paul), the oldest, was born before the family emigrated; [[John Warhola|Ján]] was born in Pittsburgh. Pavol's son, [[James Warhola]], became a successful children's book illustrator.

In third grade, Warhol had [[Sydenham's chorea]] (also known as St. Vitus' Dance), the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a complication of [[Rheumatic fever|scarlet fever]] which causes skin pigmentation blotchiness.&lt;ref name="warhol.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhol.org/collection/aboutandy/andyfaq/ |title=biography |publisher=warhol |accessdate=January 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106165536/http://www.warhol.org/collection/aboutandy/andyfaq/ |archivedate=January 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/popart/Andy-Warhol.html |title=The Prince of Pop Art |publisher=Arthistoryarchive.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707153626/http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/popart/Andy-Warhol.html |archivedate=July 7, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Warhol graduated from [[Schenley High School]] in 1945. Also as a teen, Warhol won a [[Scholastic Art and Writing Awards|Scholastic Art and Writing Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Scholastic Inc |date=March 14, 2016 |title=America's Most Creative Teens Names as National 2016 Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Award Recipients |url=http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/america-s-most-creative-teens-named-national-2016-scholastic-art-writing-awards-recipe }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school, his intentions were to study [[Visual arts education|art education]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in the hope of becoming an art teacher, but his plans changed and he enrolled in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in Pittsburgh, where he studied [[commercial art]]. During his time there, Warhol joined the campus  Modern Dance Club and Beaux Arts Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andy Warhol: The College Years |url=http://www.warhol.org/responsive/event.aspx?id=2077 |website=The Andy Warhol Museum |accessdate=February 9, 2015|ref=warholmuse}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as art director of the student art magazine, ''Cano'', illustrating a cover in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warhol.org/Warhol/Content/collection/art/earlywork/1998-1-1590 |title=Sprite Heads Playing Violins, 1948 |website=the warhol: |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209190850/http://www.warhol.org/Warhol/Content/collection/art/earlywork/1998-1-1590/|archivedate=February 9, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a full-page interior illustration in 1949.&lt;ref name=Blake&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gopnik|first1=Blake|title=Feb 9, 2015: The Daily Pic|url=http://blakegopnik.com/post/110535434580|website=Blake Gopnik on Art|accessdate=February 9, 2015|ref=gopnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are believed to be his first two published artworks.&lt;ref name=Blake/&gt; Warhol earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in pictorial design in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising.

===1950s===
Warhol's early career was dedicated to commercial and advertising art, where his first commission had been to draw shoes for ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine in the late 1940s.&lt;ref name=foot/&gt; In the 1950s, Warhol worked as a [[Footwear|designer]] for shoe manufacturer Israel Miller.&lt;ref name=foot&gt;
Benstock, Shari and Suzanne Ferriss (editors). ''Footnotes: On Shoes'';  Rutgers University Press; February 1, 2001; {{ISBN|978-0813528717}}; pp. 44–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Israel Miller see [[i.a.]] "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/realestate/10scap.html A Little Jewel Box of a Shoe Store]" by Christopher Gray, ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; American photographer John Coplans recalled that

&lt;blockquote&gt;nobody drew shoes the way Andy did. He somehow gave each shoe a temperament of its own, a sort of sly, [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] kind of sophistication, but the shape and the style came through accurately and the buckle was always in the right place. The kids in the apartment [which Andy shared in New York – note by Coplans] noticed that the [[Shoe#Construction|vamp]]s on Andy's shoe drawings kept getting longer and longer but [Israel] Miller didn't mind. Miller loved them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Warhol's "whimsical" [[Pen-and-ink drawing|ink drawing]]s of shoe advertisements figured in some of his earliest showings at the [[Bodley Gallery]] in New York.

Warhol was an early adopter of the [[Screen printing|silk screen]] printmaking process as a technique for making paintings.  A young Warhol was taught silk screen printmaking techniques by [[Max Arthur Cohn]] at his graphic arts business in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://americanart.si.edu/artist/max-arthur-cohn-935 "Max Arthur Cohn"] at SAAM.&lt;/ref&gt; While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his "blotted line" technique, applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a [[printmaking]] process on the most rudimentary scale. His use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme, a method that prefigures his 1960s silk-screen canvas.&lt;ref name=foot/&gt; In his book ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'', Warhol writes: "When you do something exactly wrong, you always turn up something."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33886455/ns/today-entertainment/t/warhols-dollar-bills-painting-fetches-millions/ |title=Warhol's dollar bills painting fetches millions|publisher=MSNBC Today |date=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sherman&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SC0MCcfRsA8C&amp;pg=PA106 |title=Pop: The Genius of Andy Warhol|author= Tony Scherman, David Dalton|publisher= HarperCollins|date= 2010 | isbn= 9780060936631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol habitually used the expedient of tracing photographs projected with an [[Opaque projector|epidiascope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Warhol, Andy | author2=Glozer, Laslo, 1936- | author3=Schellmann, Jörg | author4=Edition Schellmann | title=Andy Warhol, art from art | publication-date=1994 | publisher=Edition Schellmann ; München : Schirmer/Mosel | isbn=978-3-88814-725-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using prints by [[Edward Wallowitch]], his 'first boyfriend'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation | author1=Koestenbaun, Wayne | title=Andy Warhol : a biography | publication-date=2015 | publisher=New York, NY Open Road Integrated Media, Inc | isbn=978-1-4976-9989-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the photographs would undergo a subtle transformation during Warhol's often cursory tracing of contours and [[hatching]] of shadows. Warhol used Wallowitch's photograph ''Young Man Smoking a Cigarette'' (c.1956),&lt;ref&gt;[http://flavorwire.com/573987/warhol-by-the-book-reveals-the-icons-fascinating-career-as-a-book-artist/8 Edward Wallowitch ''Young Man Smoking a Cigarette'' (c.1956 Gelatin silver print).

With the rapid expansion of the [[record industry]], [[RCA Records]] hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Andrew |last1=Oldham |authorlink=Andrew Loog Oldham |author2=Simon Spence |author3=Christine Ohlman |title=2Stoned |publisher=[[Secker and Warburg]] |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=0-436-28015-9 |oclc=50215773|page=137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andy Warhol's first New York solo [[pop art]] exhibition was hosted at Eleanor Ward's [[Stable Gallery]] November 6–24, 1962. The exhibit included the works ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'', ''100 Soup Cans'', ''100 Coke Bottles'', and ''100 Dollar Bills''. At the [[Stable Gallery]] exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet [[John Giorno]] who would star in Warhol's first film, ''[[Sleep (1963 film)|Sleep]]'', in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warholstars.org/warhol/warhol1/warhol1b/johngiorno.html |work=www.warholstars.org |title=John Giorno }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, [[mushroom cloud]]s, [[electric chair]]s, [[Campbell's Soup Cans]], [[Coca-Cola]] bottles, celebrities such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Troy Donahue]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking African-American protesters during the [[Birmingham campaign]] in the [[civil rights movement]]. During these years, he founded his studio, "[[The Factory]]" and gathered about him a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. His work became popular and controversial. Warhol had this to say about Coca-Cola:

{{quote|What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca-Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca-Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca-Cola, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Andy |last=Warhol |title=[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol|The philosophy of Andy Warhol: from A to B and back again]] |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |year=1975 |isbn=0-15-189050-1 |oclc=1121125 |pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

New York City's [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists such as Warhol were attacked for "capitulating" to consumerism. Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception.

[[File:Warhol-Campbell Soup-1-screenprint-1968.jpg|thumb|left|''Campbell's Soup I'' (1968)|alt=|346x346px]]

A pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit ''The American Supermarket'', a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) [[Billy Apple]], Mary Inman, and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

As an [[Commercial art|advertisement illustrator]] in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was [[Gerard Malanga]]. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at "[[The Factory]]", Warhol's [[aluminum foil]]-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included [[Freddie Herko]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Ronald Tavel]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Billy Name]], and [[Brigid Berlin]] (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation "[[Warhol Superstar|Superstars]]", including [[Nico]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Jackie Curtis]], and [[Candy Darling]]. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer [[John Giorno]] and film-maker [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]], also appear in Warhol films (many premiering at the [[New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre]] and [[55th Street Playhouse]]) of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. Less well known was his support and collaboration with several teen-agers during this era, who would achieve prominence later in life including writer David Dalton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Menand|first1=Louis|title=Top of the Pops|work=New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/01/11/top-of-the-pops|date=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; photographer Stephen Shore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grow|first1=Krystal|title=Time Lightbox|url=http://lightbox.time.com/2014/09/23/stephen-shore-at-the-factory/#1|publisher=Time Inc.|date=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artist Bibbe Hansen (mother of pop musician [[Beck]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Dagon|title=Billy Name:The Silver Age Black and White Photographs of Andy Warhol's Factory|date=2014|publisher=Reel Art Press|isbn=1909526177|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempted murder (1968)====
On June 3, 1968, [[radical feminist]] writer [[Valerie Solanas]] shot Warhol and [[Mario Amaya]], art critic and curator, at Warhol's studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schaffner |first=Ingrid |authorlink=Ingrid Schaffner |title=The Essential Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams]] |location=New York City |page=79 |year=1999 |isbn=0-8109-5806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the shooting, Solanas had been a marginal figure in the Factory scene. She authored in 1967 the ''[[S.C.U.M. Manifesto]]'',&lt;ref name="Solanas"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Valerie |last=Solanas |authorlink=Valerie Solanas |title=[[SCUM Manifesto]] |publisher=Verso |location=London |origyear=1967 |year=2004 |isbn=1-85984-553-3 |oclc=53932627}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Separatist feminism|separatist feminist]] tract that advocated the elimination of men; and appeared in the 1968 Warhol film ''[[I, a Man]]''. Earlier on the day of the attack, Solanas had been turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to Warhol. The script had apparently been misplaced.&lt;ref name="Jobey"&gt;Jobey, Liz, "Solanas and Son," ''The Guardian'' (Manchester, England), August 24, 1996, p, T10 and following.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amaya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day. Warhol was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived: surgeons opened his chest and [[internal cardiac massage|massaged his heart]] to help stimulate its movement again. He suffered physical effects for the rest of his life, including being required to wear a surgical corset.&lt;ref name="warhol.org"/&gt; The shooting had a profound effect on Warhol's life and art.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harding |first=James |title=The Simplest Surrealist Act: Valerie Solanas and the (Re)Assertion of Avantgarde Priorities |journal=[[TDR (journal)|TDR/The Drama Review]] |volume=45 |issue=4; Winter 2001 |pages=142–162 |doi=10.1162/105420401772990388|year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="popism287-295"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Andy |last1=Warhol |author2=Pat Hacket |title=POPism: the Warhol '60s |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=New York |year=1980 |pages=287–295 |isbn=0-15-173095-4 |oclc=5673923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solanas was arrested the day after the assault, after turning herself in to police. By way of explanation, she said that Warhol "had too much control over my life." She was subsequently diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and eventually sentenced to three years under the control of the [[New York City Department of Correction|Department of Corrections]]. After the shooting, the Factory scene heavily increased security, and for many the "Factory 60s" ended.&lt;ref name="popism287-295"/&gt;

Warhol had this to say about the attack: "Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television."&lt;ref name="StilesSelz1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kristine Stiles|author2=Peter Howard Selz|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: a Sourcebook of Artists' Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXV-HlsUzdcC&amp;pg=PA345|accessdate=January 13, 2013|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20251-1|pages=345–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===

Compared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s, the 1970s were a much quieter decade, as he became more entrepreneurial. According to [[Bob Colacello]], Warhol devoted much of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait commissions—including Shah of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], his wife Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]], his sister [[Princess Ashraf Pahlavi]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[John Lennon]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Brigitte Bardot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8179627.stm |work=BBC News | title=Warhol's Jackson goes on display | date=August 7, 2009 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/warhol.php|title=Andy Warhol Expert art authentication, certificates of authenticity and expert appraisers|website=www.artexpertswebsite.com|access-date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol's famous portrait of Chinese Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] was created in 1973. He also founded, with [[Gerard Malanga]], ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, and published ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol'' (1975). An idea expressed in the book: "Making money is art, and working is art and good business is the best art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delves Broughton|first=Philip|title=The Art of the Sale|year=2012|publisher=The Penguin Press|location=New York, NY|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol socialized at various nightspots in New York City, including [[Max's Kansas City]]; and, later in the 1970s, [[Studio 54]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |title=Andy Warhol Biography: From The Velvet Underground To Basquiat |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107015819/http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |archivedate=January 7, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was generally regarded as quiet, shy, and a meticulous observer.

In 1979, along with his longtime friend [[Stuart Pivar]], Warhol founded the [[New York Academy of Art]].&lt;ref name="NYM 1992"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gOMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |title=New York Magazine Jan 27, 1992 |publisher= |date=January 27, 1992 |accessdate=December 4, 2013|author1=New York Media |first1=LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |title=New York Magazine Apr 8, 1996 |publisher= |date=April 8, 1996 |accessdate=December 4, 2013|author1=New York Media |first1=LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Warhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the "[[bull market]]" of 1980s New York art: [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[David Salle]] and other so-called [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-Expressionists]], as well as members of the [[Transavantgarde]] movement in Europe, including [[Francesco Clemente]] and [[Enzo Cucchi]]. Before the 1984 [[Sarajevo]] [[Winter Olympics]], he teamed with 15 other artists, including [[David Hockney]] and [[Cy Twombly]], and contributed a [[Speed Skater]] print to the Art and Sport collection. The Speed Skater was used for the official [[1984 Winter Olympics|Sarajevo Winter Olympics]] poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aanddgallery.com/store/images/uploads/WarholWinterolympics.jpg|title="Speed Skater" official 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics poster by Andy Warhol|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, [[graffiti]] artist [[Fab Five Freddy]] paid homage to Warhol when he painted an entire train with Campbell soup cans. This was instrumental in Freddy becoming involved in the underground NYC art scene and becoming an affiliate of Basquiat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip Hop Family Tree|last=Piskor|first=Ed|publisher=Fantagraphics|year=2013|isbn=1606996908|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this period, Warhol was being criticized for becoming merely a "business artist".&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michal |last=Lando |date=April 8, 2008 |title=Reexamining Warhol's Jews |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207486218796&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=January 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703204535/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207486218796&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archivedate=July 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, reviewers disliked his exhibits of portraits of 1970s personalities and celebrities, calling them superficial, facile and commercial, with no depth or indication of the significance of the subjects. They also criticized his 1980 exhibit of 10 portraits at the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] in Manhattan, entitled ''Jewish Geniuses'', which Warhol—who was uninterested in [[Judaism]] and Jews—had described in his diary as "They're going to sell."&lt;ref name="jpost" /&gt; In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as "the most brilliant mirror of our times," contending that "Warhol had captured something irresistible about the [[zeitgeist]] of American culture in the 1970s."&lt;ref name="jpost" /&gt;

Warhol also had an appreciation for intense [[Hollywood glamour]]. He once said: "I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They're so beautiful. Everything's plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Victor |last1=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |author2=[[Gerard Malanga]] |title=Up-tight: the Velvet Underground story |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London |year=2002 |page=66 |isbn=0-7119-9170-7 |oclc=49906101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Warhol immortalized the singer [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] by creating one of his final portraits, [[Prince (painting)|''Orange Prince (1984)'']], a commission from Vanity Fair to accompany an article to celebrate the success of Prince's [[Purple Rain (album)|album]] and [[Purple Rain (film)|movie entitled ''Purple Rain'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/04/prince-at-the-height-of-his-powers|title=Purple Fame: An Appreciation of Prince at the Height of His Powers.

In the ''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries|Andy Warhol Diaries]]'', Warhol recorded how excited he was to see Prince and [[Billy Idol]] together at a party in the mid 1980s, and he compared them to the Hollywood movie stars of the 1950s and '60s who also inspired his portraits: "... seeing these two glamour boys, its like ''boys'' are the new Hollywood glamour girls, like [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Andy Warhol diaries |date=2014 |last=Warhol |first=Andy |last2=Hackett |first2=Pat |isbn=9781455561452|edition= 1st Twelve |location=New York, NY |publisher=Twelve |oclc=881024850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paintings===
By the beginning of the 1960s, [[pop art]] was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as [[Roy Lichtenstein]], would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the "Pope of Pop", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]]). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bronwit Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries [[Jasper Johns]], [[James Rosenquist]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had also once graced.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Patrick S (1986).

It was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhol's dollar paintings. On November 23, 1961, Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, ''Pop, The Genius of Warhol'', was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |title=The Soup Cans—Andy Warhol |publisher=Warholstars.org |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801234441/http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |archivedate=August 1, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his first major exhibition, Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell's soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life. A 1964 ''Large Campbell's Soup Can'' was sold in a 2007 [[Sotheby's]] auction to a South American collector  for £5.1 million ($7.4 million).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.artnet.com/market/sothebys-100-million-contemporary-art-evening-sale-422258 Early Lucian Freud Painting Leads Sotheby’s $100 Million Contemporary Art Evening Sale]" by Colin Gleadell, ''[[Artnet]]'', February 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

He loved [[celebrity|celebrities]], so he painted them as well. From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group-4 race version of the then "elite supercar" [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]]. It was reported at the time that, unlike the three artists before him, Warhol opted to paint directly onto the automobile himself instead of letting technicians transfer his scale-model design to the car.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060525054033/http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/Andy-Warhol-lg.jpg Bmw Art Car 1979: M1 by Andy Warhol], ''Car Body Design'', March 27, 2006 (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213000309/http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |title=Bmw Art Car 1979: M1 by Andy Warhol |publisher=carbodydesign.com |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol produced both comic and serious works; his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques—silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors—whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962–63 ''Death and Disaster'' series. The ''Death and Disaster'' paintings included ''Red Car Crash'', ''Purple Jumping Man'', and ''Orange Disaster.'' One of these paintings, the diptych ''Silver Car Crash'', became the highest priced work of his when it sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction on Wednesday, November 13, 2013, for $105.4 million.&lt;ref name="sothebys.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Sotheby's – November 14, 2013 |url=http://www.sothebys.com/content/sothebys/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/contemporary/2013/11/record-warhol-leads-.html |title=Record Warhol Leads Contemporary Sale &amp;#124; Sotheby's |publisher=Sothebys.com |date=November 14, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Warhol's work, as well as his own personality, has been described as being [[Buster Keaton|Keatonesque]]. Warhol has been described as playing dumb to the media. He sometimes refused to explain his work. He has suggested that all one needs to know about his work is "already there 'on the surface'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/warhol.php |title=Andy Warhol Biography (1928–1987) |publisher=Art Experts |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblots]] are intended as pop comments on art and what art could be. His cow wallpaper (literally, wallpaper with a cow [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]) and his [[redox|oxidation]] paintings (canvases prepared with copper paint that was then oxidized with urine) are also noteworthy in this context. Equally noteworthy is the way these works—and their [[means of production]]—mirrored the atmosphere at Andy's New York "Factory". Biographer Bob Colacello provides some details on Andy's "piss paintings":

{{quote|Victor&amp;nbsp; ... was Andy's ghost pisser on the Oxidations. He would come to the Factory to urinate on canvases that had already been primed with copper-based paint by Andy or Ronnie Cutrone, a second ghost pisser much appreciated by Andy, who said that the vitamin B that Ronnie took made a prettier color when the acid in the urine turned the copper green. Did Andy ever use his own urine? My diary shows that when he first began the series, in December 1977, he did, and there were many others: boys who'd come to lunch and drink too much wine, and find it funny or even flattering to be asked to help Andy 'paint'. Andy always had a little extra bounce in his walk as he led them to his studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bob |last=Colacello |authorlink=Bob Colacello |title=Holy terror: Andy Warhol close up |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=1990 |page=343 |isbn=0-06-016419-0 |oclc=21196706}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Warhol's first portrait of ''Basquiat'' (1982) is a black photo-silkscreen over an oxidized copper "piss painting".

After many years of silkscreen, oxidation, photography, etc., Warhol returned to painting with a brush in hand in a series of more than 50 large collaborative works done with [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] between 1984 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Chiappini, Rudi (ed.), ''Jean-Michel Basquiat''.

Andy Warhol was commissioned in 1984 by collector and gallerist [[Alexander Iolas]] to produce work based on [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' for an exhibition at the old refectory of the Palazzo delle Stelline in [[Milan]], opposite from the [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] where Leonardo da Vinci's mural can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schmuckli, [http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/warhol/ "Andy Warhol: The Last Supper" (June 1999 – December 2001)] [[Guggenheim Museum SoHo]]. Retrieved September 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol exceeded the demands of the commission and produced nearly 100 variations on the theme, mostly silkscreens and paintings, and among them a collaborative sculpture with Basquiat, the ''Ten Punching Bags (Last Supper)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warhol.org/education/resourceslessons/Jean-Michel-Basquiat/ Collaboration with Andy Warhol: Jean Michel Basquiat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082251/http://www.warhol.org/education/resourceslessons/Jean-Michel-Basquiat/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}, The Andy Warhol Museum.

Artist [[Maurizio Cattelan]] describes that it is difficult to separate daily encounters from the art of Andy Warhol: "That's probably the greatest thing about Warhol: the way he penetrated and summarized our world, to the point that distinguishing between him and our everyday life is basically impossible, and in any case useless."

In the period just before his death, Warhol was working on ''[[Cars (painting)|Cars]]'', a series of paintings for [[Mercedes-Benz]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/01/arts.warhol|title=Warhol: Cars|date=September 1, 2001|accessdate=April 24, 2010|work=The Guardian |location=London | first=Maev | last=Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-portrait by Andy Warhol (1963–64), which sold in New York at the May Post-War and Contemporary evening sale in [[Christie's]], fetched $38.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13371502|title=Andy Warhol self-portrait fetches $38.4m|date=May 12, 2011|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2012, his classic painting ''Double Elvis (Ferus Type)'' sold at auction at [[Sotheby's]] in New York for US$33 million. With commission, the sale price totaled US$37,042,500, short of the $50 million that Sotheby's had predicted the painting might bring. The piece (silkscreen ink and [[spray paint]] on canvas) shows [[Elvis Presley]] in a [[gunslinger]] pose. It was first exhibited in 1963 at the [[Ferus Gallery]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Warhol made 22 versions of the ''Double Elvis'', nine of which are held in museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AP|title=Warhol 'Elvis' sells for $37M; Lichtenstein, Weiwei works break own records at NYC auction|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/warhol-elvis-sells-for-37m-lichtenstein-weiwei-works-break-own-records-at-nyc-auction/2012/05/09/gIQAQQKDEU_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
[[File:Empire Screenshot Warhol.jpg|thumb|240x240px|Screenshot from the [[Empire (1964 film)|''Empire'']].|alt=]]
Warhol worked across a wide range of media—painting, photography, drawing, and sculpture. In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/|title=Andy Warhol Filmography|work=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus some 500 short black-and-white "[[Screen Tests|screen test]]" portraits of Factory visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffner (1999), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (1963 film)|Sleep]]'', monitors poet [[John Giorno]] sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' is one continuous shot of the face of [[DeVeren Bookwalter]] supposedly receiving [[oral sex]] from filmmaker [[Willard Maas]], although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. The film ''[[Eat (film)|Eat]]'' consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by [[LaMonte Young]] called ''Trio for Strings'' and subsequently created his famous series of static films including ''Kiss'', ''Eat'', and ''Sleep'' (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker [[Jonas Mekas]], who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Uwe |last=Husslein |title=Pop goes art: Andy Warhol &amp; Velvet Underground |publisher=Wuppertal |year=1990 |oclc=165575494}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Batman Dracula]]'' is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of [[DC Comics]]. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the ''Batman''  series, Warhol's movie was an "homage" to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly [[Camp (style)|campy]] Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary ''[[Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis]]''.

Warhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as [[Brigid Berlin]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Nico]], and [[Jackie Curtis]]. Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.

His most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two [[16 mm film|16 mm]]-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that "story" while it was lowered for the other. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol's seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s.

Warhol was a fan of filmmaker [[Radley Metzger]]{{'s}} film work&lt;ref name="FD-20140807"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hudson |first=David |title= This Is Softcore: The Art Cinema Erotica of Radley Metzger |url=https://www.fandor.com/keyframe/daily-this-is-softcore-the-art-cinema-erotica-of-radley-metzger |date=August 7, 2014 |work=[[Fandor (film site)|Fandor]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented that Metzger's film, ''[[The Lickerish Quartet]]'', was "an outrageously kinky masterpiece".&lt;ref name="NYT-20170404"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandmir |first=Richard |title=Radley Metzger, Whose Artful Erotica Turned Explicit, Dies at 88 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/movies/radley-metzger-director-who-left-erotica-for-hard-core-dies-at-88.html |date=April 4, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TRR-20170402"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Metzger |first1=Juliette |last2=Feldman |first2=Caryl |last3=West |first3=Ashley |title=Press Release: Radley Metzger, pioneering filmmaker, dies at 88 |url=http://www.therialtoreport.com/2017/04/02/radley-metzger-2/ |date=April 2, 2017 |work=[[The Rialto Report]] |accessdate=April 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FSLC-AndyWarhol"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |title=''The Lickerish Quartet''|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/the-lickerish-quartet |date=August 8, 2014|work=[[Film Society of Lincoln Center]]|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blue Movie]]''—a film in which Warhol superstar [[Viva (actress)|Viva]] makes love in bed with [[Louis Waldon]], another Warhol superstar—was Warhol's last film as director.&lt;ref name="NYT-19690722"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review – Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19690810"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

After his June 3, 1968, shooting, a reclusive Warhol relinquished his personal involvement in filmmaking. His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for [[the Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie [[exploitation film|exploitation]] fare with ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (1970 film)|Trash]]'', and ''[[Heat (1972 film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter "Warhol" films starred [[Joe Dallesandro]]—more of a Morrissey star than a true [[Warhol superstar]].

In the early 1970s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.

===Music===
In the mid-1960s, Warhol adopted the band [[the Velvet Underground]], making them a crucial element of the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] multimedia performance art show. Warhol, with [[Paul Morrissey]], acted as the band's manager, introducing them to [[Nico]] (who would perform with the band at Warhol's request). While managing [[The Velvet Underground]], Andy would have them dressed in all black to perform in front of movies that he was also presenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/955634990|title=Please kill me : the uncensored oral history of punk|others=McNeil, Legs,, McCain, Gillian,|isbn=9780802125361|edition= Twentieth anniversary |location=New York|oclc=955634990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he "produced" their first album ''[[The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico]]'', as well as providing its album art. His actual participation in the album's production amounted to simply paying for the studio time. After the band's first album, Warhol and band leader [[Lou Reed]] started to disagree more about the direction the band should take, and their artistic friendship ended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1989, after Warhol's death, Reed and [[John Cale]] re-united for the first time since 1972 to write, perform, record and release the concept album ''[[Songs for Drella]]'', a tribute to Warhol.

Warhol designed many album covers for various artists starting with the photographic cover of [[John Wallowitch]]'s debut album, ''This Is John Wallowitch!!!'' (1964). He designed the cover art for [[The Rolling Stones]]' albums ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971) and ''[[Love You Live]]'' (1977), and the [[John Cale]] albums ''[[The Academy in Peril]]'' (1972) and ''[[Honi Soit (album)|Honi Soit]]'' in 1981. One of Warhol's last works was a portrait of [[Aretha Franklin]] for the cover of her 1986 [[Music recording sales certification|gold album]] ''[[Aretha (1986 album)|Aretha]]'', which was done in the style of the ''Reigning Queens'' series he had completed the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bego | first = Mark |title =Aretha Franklin: The Queen of Soul |publisher=Da Capo Press |year = 2001 | page = 250 |isbn = 0-306-80935-4 |oclc = 46488152 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ErKigdCXUwoC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=warhol+album+cover+1986 | accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol strongly influenced the [[New wave music|new wave]]/[[punk rock]] band [[Devo]], as well as [[David Bowie]]. Bowie recorded a song called "[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]" for his 1971 album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''. Lou Reed wrote the song "Andy's Chest", about [[Valerie Solanas]], the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the ''[[VU (album)|VU]]'' album in 1985. Bowie would later play Warhol in the 1996 movie, ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]''. Bowie recalled how meeting Warhol in real life helped him in the role, and recounted his early meetings with him:

{{quote|I met him a couple of times, but we seldom shared more than platitudes. The first time we saw each other an awkward silence fell till he remarked my bright yellow shoes and started talking enthusiastically. He wanted to be very superficial. And seemingly emotionless, indifferent, just like a dead fish. Lou Reed described him most profoundly when he once told me they should bring a doll of Andy on the market: a doll that you wind up and doesn't do anything. But I managed to observe him well, and that was a helping hand for the film ''[Basquiat'']. … We borrowed his clothes from the museum in Pittsburgh, and they were intact, unwashed. Even the pockets weren't emptied: they contained pancake, white, deadly pale ''{{abbr|fond de teint|foundation}}'' which Andy always smeared on his face, a check torn in pieces, someone's address, lots of homeopathic pills and a wig. Andy always wore those silver wigs, but he never admitted it were wigs. One of his hairdressers has told me lately that he had his wigs regularly cut, like it were real hair. When the wig was trimmed, he put on another next month as if his hair had grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/95/h.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616041825/http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/95/h.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 16, 2013 |title=Can the Real David Bowie Rise, Please? |journal=''[[HUMO]]'' magazine |date=December 5, 1995 |accessdate=June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Books and print===
[[File:Warhol autograph.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Warhol drawing and signature]]
Beginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work.

The first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was ''[[25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy]]'', printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs. The original edition was limited to 190 numbered, hand colored copies, using Dr. Martin's ink washes. Most of these were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends. Copy No. 4, inscribed "Jerry" on the front cover and given to [[Geraldine Stutz]], was used for a facsimile printing in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John |last=Russell |authorlink=John Russell (art critic) |date=December 6, 1987 |title=Art |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/06/books/art.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US $35,000 by [[Doyle New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doylenewyork.com/default.htm May 3, 2006, auction at Doyle New York]. Retrieved August 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other self-published books by Warhol include:
* ''A Gold Book''
* ''Wild Raspberries''
* ''Holy Cats''

Warhol's book ''A La Recherche du Shoe Perdu'' (1955) marked his "transition from commercial to gallery artist".&lt;ref name=SmithAllaraWarhol2002&gt;Smith, John W., Pamela Allara, and Andy Warhol. ''Possession Obsession: Andy Warhol and Collecting''. Pittsburgh, PA: Andy Warhol Museum, 2002, p. 46. {{ISBN|0-9715688-0-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (The title is a [[wordplay|play on words]] by Warhol on the title of French author [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]''.)&lt;ref name=SmithAllaraWarhol2002/&gt;

After gaining fame, Warhol "wrote" several books that were commercially published:
* ''[[A, a novel|a, A Novel]]'' (1968, {{ISBN|0-8021-3553-6}}) is a literal transcription—containing spelling errors and phonetically written background noise and mumbling—of audio recordings of [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]] and several of Andy Warhol's friends hanging out at the Factory, talking, going out.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]] (From A to B &amp; Back Again)'' (1975, {{ISBN|0-15-671720-4}})—according to Pat Hackett's introduction to ''The Andy Warhol Diaries'', Pat Hackett did the transcriptions and text for the book based on daily phone conversations, sometimes (when Warhol was traveling) using audio cassettes that Andy Warhol gave her. Said cassettes contained conversations with [[Brigid Berlin]] (also known as Brigid Polk) and former ''Interview'' magazine editor [[Bob Colacello]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'' (1980, {{ISBN|0-15-672960-1}}), authored by Warhol and Pat Hackett, is a retrospective view of the 1960s and the role of pop art.
* ''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries]]'' (1989, {{ISBN|0-446-39138-7}}), edited by Pat Hackett, is a diary dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations. Warhol started the diary to keep track of his expenses after being audited, although it soon evolved to include his personal and cultural observations.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol created the fashion magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' that is still published today. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other media===
Although Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he authored works in many different media.
*[[File:Silver Clouds Warhol Musee dArt Moderne ville Paris.jpg|thumb|''Silver Clouds'' Reproduction at the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], December 2015, Warhol Unlimited Exposition]]'''Drawing:''' Warhol started his career as a commercial illustrator, producing drawings in "blotted-ink" style for advertisements and magazine articles. Best known of these early works are his drawings of shoes. Some of his personal drawings were self-published in small booklets, such as ''Yum, Yum, Yum'' (about food), ''Ho, Ho, Ho'' (about Christmas) and ''Shoes, Shoes, Shoes''. His most artistically acclaimed book of drawings is probably ''A Gold Book'', compiled of sensitive drawings of young men. ''A Gold Book'' is so named because of the [[gold leaf]] that decorates its pages.&lt;ref name=Bourdon51&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N.

The image was said to have been drawn when Andy was nine or 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-17591826 |title='Andy Warhol sketch found' in US garage sale |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various authorities have challenged the image's authenticity.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
* '''Sculpture:''' Warhol's most famous sculpture is probably his ''Brillo Boxes'', silkscreened ink on wood replicas of the large, branded cardboard boxes used to hold 24 packages of [[Brillo]] soap pads. The original Brillo design was by commercial artist [[James Harvey (artist)|James Harvey]]. Warhol's sculpture was part of a series of "grocery carton" works that also included Heinz ketchup and Campbell's tomato juice cases.&lt;ref name="365 Takes"&gt;{{cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N.

A ''Silver Cloud'' was included in the traveling exhibition ''Air Art'' (1968–1969) curated by [[Willoughby Sharp]]. ''Clouds'' was also adapted by Warhol for [[avant-garde]] choreographer Merce Cunningham's dance piece ''RainForest'' (1968).&lt;ref name=Bourdon231&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N.

* '''Audio:''' At one point Warhol carried a portable recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said and did. He referred to this device as his "wife". Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol's was his ''Invisible Sculpture'', a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol's cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* '''Time Capsules:''' In 1973, Warhol began saving ephemera from his daily life—correspondence, newspapers, souvenirs, childhood objects, even used plane tickets and food—which was sealed in plain cardboard boxes dubbed Time Capsules. By the time of his death, the collection grew to include 600, individually dated "capsules". The boxes are now housed at the Andy Warhol Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N.

* '''Television:''' Andy Warhol dreamed of a [[television special]] about a favorite subject of his{{dash}}[[Nothing]]{{dash}}that he would call ''The Nothing Special''. Later in his career he did create two cable television shows, ''Andy Warhol's TV'' in 1982 and ''[[Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes]]'' (based on his famous "[[fifteen minutes of fame]]" quotation) for MTV in 1986. Besides his own shows he regularly made guest appearances on other programs, including ''[[The Love Boat]]'' wherein a Midwestern wife ([[Marion Ross]]) fears Andy Warhol will reveal to her husband ([[Tom Bosley]], who starred alongside Ross in sitcom ''[[Happy Days]]'') her secret past as a Warhol superstar named Marina del Rey. Warhol also produced a TV commercial for [[Schrafft's]] Restaurants in New York City, for an ice cream dessert appropriately titled the "Underground Sundae".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm |title=Underground Sundae |year=2005 |first=Michael |last=Ferguson |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116182237/http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm |archivedate=January 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pork'' was based on tape-recorded conversations between Brigid Berlin and Andy during which Brigid would play for Andy tapes she had made of phone conversations between herself and her mother, socialite Honey Berlin. The play featured [[Jayne County]] as "Vulva" and [[Cherry Vanilla]] as "Amanda Pork".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Andy Warhol Museum|url=http://www.warhol.org/responsive/event.aspx?id=2215|accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Andy Warhol also produced the stage musical ''[[Man on the Moon (musical)|Man on the Moon]]'', which was written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of the [[Mamas and the Papas]].

===Producer and product===
He founded the gossip magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'', a stage for celebrities he "endorsed" and a business staffed by his friends. He collaborated with others on all of his books (some of which were written with Pat Hackett.) He adopted the young painter [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and the band [[The Velvet Underground]], presenting them to the public as his latest interest, and collaborating with them. One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian "Superstar" and the Warholian portrait). He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from ''[[Love Boat]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Matheson | first=Whitney | date=August 6, 2013 | title=See six of Warhol's best film/TV appearances | work=[[USA Today]] | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2013/08/06/andy-warhol-video/2623869/ | access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | last1=Munroe | first1=Don | last2=Fremont | first2=Vincent | last3=Etkin | first3=Sue | date=October 10, 1981 | title=Andy Warhol's TV: Makeup and Death | language = English | publisher=''[[NBC]]'' | url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/warhol-film/n8846?snl=1 | access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Richard Pryor]] movie ''Dynamite Chicken''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Obituaries | date=February 7, 2002 | title=Ernest Pintoff, 70; Animator Won Oscar | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/07/local/me-pintoff7 | access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The fact that Warhol's homosexuality influenced his work and shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and is an issue that Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications (''e.g.'', ''Popism: The Warhol 1960s''). Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and films such as ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'', ''My Hustler'' and ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'') draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters, including the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre and 55th Street Playhouse, in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Waugh, ''Hard to Imagine: Gay Male eroticism in Photography and Film from the Beginnings to Stonewall'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first works that Warhol submitted to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In ''Popism'', furthermore, the artist recalls a conversation with the film maker [[Emile de Antonio]] about the difficulty Warhol had being accepted socially by the then-more-famous (but [[closeted]]) gay artists [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. De Antonio explained that Warhol was "too swish and that upsets them." In response to this, Warhol writes, "There was nothing I could say to that. It was all too true. So I decided I just wasn't going to care, because those were all the things that I didn't want to change anyway, that I didn't think I 'should' want to change&amp;nbsp; ... Other people could change their attitudes but not me".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Gavin |last=Butt |title=Between you and me: queer disclosures in the New York art world, 1948–1963 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, N.C |year=2005 |isbn=0-8223-3486-0 |oclc=57285910 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exploring Warhol's biography, many turn to this period—the late 1950s and early 1960s—as a key moment in the development of his persona. Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like "Um, no" and "Um, yes", and often allowing others to speak for him)—and even the evolution of his pop style—can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.&lt;ref name="Fairbrother"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fairbrother |first=Trevor |chapter=Tomorrow's Man |title=Success Is a Job in New York: the Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol |editor=Donna De Salvo |location=New York |publisher=Grey Art Gallery and Study Center |year=1989 |pages=55–74 |isbn=0-934349-05-3 |oclc=19826995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
[[File:WarholLastSup.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Images of Jesus from ''The [[Last Supper]]'' cycle (1986). Warhol made almost 100 variations on the theme, which the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] felt "indicates an almost obsessive investment in the subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Claudia |last=Schmuckli |url=http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/warhol/ |title=Andy Warhol: The Last Supper |publisher=[[Solomon R.

Warhol was a practicing [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic]]. He regularly volunteered at [[homeless shelter]]s in New York City, particularly during the busier times of the year, and described himself as a religious person.&lt;ref name="godspy-Warhol"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James |last=Romaine |date=November 12, 2003 |title=Transubstantiating the Culture: Andy Warhol's Secret |url=http://oldarchive.godspy.com/culture/Andy-Warhol-Transubstantiating-the-Culture.cfm.html |journal=[[Godspy]] |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Warhol's later works depicted religious subjects, including two series, ''Details of Renaissance Paintings'' (1984) and ''The Last Supper'' (1986). In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.&lt;ref name="godspy-Warhol"/&gt;

During his life, Warhol regularly attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Liturgy]], and the priest at Warhol's church, [[Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (New York)|Saint Vincent Ferrer]], said that the artist went there almost daily,&lt;ref name="godspy-Warhol"/&gt; although he was not observed taking [[Eucharist#Catholic|Communion]] or going to [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Confession]] and sat or knelt in the pews at the back.&lt;ref name="Warhol at SVFC"/&gt; The priest thought he was afraid of being recognized; Warhol said he was self-conscious about being seen in a [[Roman Rite]] church [[sign of the Cross|crossing himself]] "in the [[Byzantine Rite|Orthodox]] way" (right to left instead of the reverse).&lt;ref name="Warhol at SVFC"/&gt;

His art is noticeably influenced by the [[Eastern Christian]] tradition which was so evident in his places of worship.&lt;ref name="godspy-Warhol"/&gt;

Warhol's brother has described the artist as "really religious, but he didn't want people to know about that because [it was] private". Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol's [[eulogy]] [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] depicted it as devout: "To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]]. He took considerable pride in financing his nephew's studies for the priesthood".&lt;ref name="godspy-Warhol"/&gt;

===Collections===
Warhol was an avid collector. His friends referred to his numerous collections, which filled not only his four-story [[townhouse]], but also a nearby storage unit, as "Andy's Stuff." The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his "Stuff."

Warhol's collections included a Coca-cola memorabilia sign, and 19th century paintings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-08/entertainment/ca-3738_1_pop-art|title=Warhol: Pop Artist or Crusader for Tradition?|last=MUCHNIC|first=SUZANNE|date=May 8, 1988|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with airplane menus, unpaid invoices, pizza dough, pornographic pulp novels, newspapers, stamps, supermarket flyers, and cookie jars, among other eccentricities. It also included significant works of art, such as [[George Bellows]]'s ''[[Miss Bentham]]''.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barber.org.uk/american-acquisition-barber/ |title=American Acquisition |publisher=Barber Institute of Fine Arts |accessdate=February 16, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217000620/http://barber.org.uk/american-acquisition-barber/ |archivedate=February 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his main collections was his [[wig]]s. Warhol owned more than 40 and felt very protective of his hairpieces, which were sewn by a New York wig-maker from hair imported from Italy. In 1985 a girl snatched Warhol's wig off his head. It was later discovered in Warhol's diary entry for that day that he wrote: "I don't know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony."

Another item found in Warhol's boxes at the museum in Pittsburgh was a [[mummy|mummified]] human foot from [[Ancient Egypt]]. The curator of anthropology at [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] felt that Warhol most likely found it at a flea market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inktank.fi/the-5-most-unusual-habits-of-andy-warhol/ |title=The 5 most unusual habits of Andy Warhol |publisher=Inktank.fi |date=November 20, 2012 |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol died in Manhattan at 6:32&amp;nbsp;a.m. on February 22, 1987 at age 58. According to news reports, he had been making a good recovery from [[gallbladder]] surgery at [[New York Hospital]] before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative [[cardiac arrhythmia|irregular heartbeat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/nyregion/hospital-asserts-it-gave-warhol-adequate-care.html |first=Robert O. |last=Boorstin |title=Hospital Asserts it Gave Warhol Adequate Care |date=April 13, 1987 |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors.&lt;ref name="NYM 1992" /&gt; His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and [[water intoxication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Ronald |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/05/nyregion/care-faulted-in-the-death-of-warhol.html |title=Care faulted in the death of warhol |work=The New York Times |date=December 5, 1991 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-12-24/news/9112240841_1_warhol-york-hospital-gallstones |title=Andy Warhol Heirs Settle Lawsuit With Hospital Over Artist's Death| work= Orlando Sentinel |publisher= |date=December 24, 1991 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before Warhol's death, doctors expected Warhol to survive the surgery, though a revaluation of the case about thirty years after his death showed many indications that Warhol's surgery was in fact riskier than originally thought.&lt;ref name="death-nyt"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gobnik|first1=Blake |title=Warhol's Death: Not So Simple, After All |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/arts/design/andy-warhols-death-not-so-routine-after-all.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=February 22, 2017 | deadurl = No | archivedate = February 22, 2017 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Farts%2Fdesign%2Fandy-warhols-death-not-so-routine-after-all.html%3Faction%3Dclick%26contentCollection%3DU.S.%26module%3DTrending%26version%3DFull%26region%3DMarginalia%26pgtype%3Darticle&amp;date=2017-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely reported at the time that Warhol died of a "routine" surgery, though when considering factors such as his age, a [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] of gallbladder problems, his previous [[Ballistic trauma|gunshot wounds]], and his medical state in the weeks leading up to the procedure, the potential risk of death following the surgery appeared to have been significant.&lt;ref name="death-nyt" /&gt;

Warhol's brothers took his body back to Pittsburgh, where an open-coffin [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] was held at the Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home. The solid bronze casket had gold-plated rails and white upholstery. Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, a platinum wig, and sunglasses. He was laid out holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral liturgy was held at the [[Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church]] on Pittsburgh's [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Side]]. The eulogy was given by Monsignor Peter Tay. [[Yoko Ono]] and [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] were speakers. The coffin was covered with white roses and [[Asparagus aethiopicus|asparagus ferns]]. After the liturgy, the coffin was driven to [[St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery]] in [[Bethel Park, Pennsylvania|Bethel Park]], a south suburb of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 49627). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the grave, the priest said a brief prayer and sprinkled holy water on the casket. Before the coffin was lowered, Paige Powell dropped a copy of ''Interview'' magazine, an ''Interview'' T-shirt, and a bottle of the [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estee Lauder]] perfume "Beautiful" into the grave. Warhol was buried next to his mother and father. A memorial service was held in Manhattan for Warhol on April 1, 1987, at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]].

==Foundation==
Warhol's will dictated that his entire estate—with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members—would go to create a foundation dedicated to the "advancement of the visual arts". Warhol had so many possessions that it took [[Sotheby's]] nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than US$20&amp;nbsp;million.

In 1987, in accordance with Warhol's will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts began. The foundation serves as the estate of Andy Warhol, but also has a mission "to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process" and is "focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature."&lt;ref name="warholfoundation intro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholfoundation.org/foundation/overview.html|title=Introduction |publisher=The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===

Warhol appeared as himself in the film ''[[Cocaine Cowboys (1979 film)|Cocaine Cowboys]]'' (1979)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|author=Lommel, Ulli |title=Cocaine Cowboys|date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the film ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982).

After his death, Warhol was portrayed by [[Crispin Glover]] in [[Oliver Stone]]'s film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'' (1991), by [[David Bowie]] in [[Julian Schnabel]]'s film ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' (1996), and by [[Jared Harris]] in [[Mary Harron]]'s film ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'' (1996).

Warhol appears as a character in [[Michael Daugherty]]'s opera ''[[Jackie O (the opera)|Jackie O]]'' (1997). Actor Mark Bringleson makes a brief cameo as Warhol in ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' (1997).

Many films by avant-garde cineast [[Jonas Mekas]] have caught the moments of Warhol's life. Sean Gregory Sullivan depicted Warhol in the film ''[[54 (film)|54]]'' (1998). [[Guy Pearce]] portrayed Warhol in the film ''[[Factory Girl (film)|Factory Girl]]'' (2007) about [[Edie Sedgwick]]'s life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|author= Hickenlooper, George |title=Factory Girl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Greg Travis]] portrays Warhol in a brief scene from the film ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' (2009).

In the film ''[[Men in Black 3]]'' (2012) Andy Warhol turns out to really be undercover MIB Agent W (played by [[Bill Hader]]). Warhol is throwing a party at The Factory in 1969, where he is looked up by MIB Agents K and J (J from the future). Agent W is desperate to end his undercover job ("I'm so out of ideas I'm painting soup cans and bananas, for Christ sakes!", "You gotta fake my death, okay? I can't listen to sitar music anymore." and "I can't tell the girls from the boys.").

Andy Warhol (portrayed by [[Tom Meeten]]) is one of main characters of the 2012 British television show ''[[Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy]]''. The character is portrayed as having robot-like mannerisms.

In the 2017 feature ''[[Billionaire Boys Club (2017 film)|The Billionaire Boys Club]]'' [[Cary Elwes]] portrays Warhol in a film based on the true story about Ron Levin (portrayed by [[Kevin Spacey]]) a friend of Warhol's who was murdered in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Andy Warhol Diaries]]'' (1989, {{ISBN|0-446-39138-7}}), edited by Pat Hackett; Entry date: Thursday, September 25, 1986; pp. 773.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Army of God''' is the first episode of the [[BBC]] archaeology drama ''[[Bonekickers]]''. It aired on July 8, 2008. It was written by ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'' creator [[Matthew Graham]], and filmed in the [[Bath, Somerset|City of Bath]]. A small amount of the episode, as with the following episodes, relies on a flashback to the time that the archaeologists are studying.

==Characters==
*Dr. Gillian Magwilde – [[Julie Graham]]
*Dr. Ben Ergha – [[Adrian Lester]]
*Professor Gregory "Dolly" Parton – [[Hugh Bonneville]]
*Vivian "Viv" Davis – [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]]
*Professor Daniel Mastiff – [[Michael Maloney]]
*Edward Laygass – [[Paul Rhys]]
*"James" – [[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Paul Nicholls]]
*"Colm" – [[Oliver Jackson Cohen]]

==Plot==
The episode is set in the City of Bath, and Gillian Magwilde and her team have been called out to a building site, after builders found Arabian dirhems buried in the site. After being told off briefly by Ben Ergha, Vivian Davis is revealed to be the student archaeologist studying with the team. Gillian has a cold, snubbing attitude towards Viv in the beginning, telling her to simply get on with some cataloguing. But after further inspection of the computerised earth scanner, Viv notices that there is more to the dig site.

Gillian and the rest of the team proceed to excavate the second place, now distinctly forming a [[crucifix]] shape when looked at from above. Before long, a skeleton is found, with more dirhems scattered around. This leads to much speculation, as the crusades happened in the Holy Land, not in England.

Before long, however, Gillian and Ben have to leave to go to the launching of a book written by the head of the archaeology department, Daniel Mastiff, entitled ''Sex Rites of the Ancients''. After a few witty remarks on Gillian's part, the two head back to the dig site.

Meanwhile, however, Viv has been looking through the earth, when she finds a 13th-century sandal, and proceeds to show it to the hospice nurse that she has been talking to. The nurse quickly points out another mound, and after inspection, they both proceed to pull a cut of wood out. A splinter from the wood gets stuck in the nurse's finger, as Viv takes the wood back to the lab.

After Gregory "Dolly" Parton completes a test on a scrap of material, the body found is revealed to be a Knight Templar, due to the distinct red cross revealed by the UV light. This raises further questions about Templars in England, with the only explanation being the exile of the Knights by King Philip I of France.

Viv gives Gillian the piece of wood that she found, and after sending Ben to do a dendrochronology test on it, the rest of the team discuss what could have happened. Before serious speculation took place, however, the dendrochronology test was complete, with the wood dating back to 32AD, and with blood soaked into it with metallic traces. Thoughts arise here about whether the wood could be part of the [[True Cross]].

Meanwhile, two Christian fanatics named Jack and Colm prepare themselves with swords for what they call a 'war', and make their way to a [[mosque]], where they pray to God in the sunlight. Four young Muslims enter the building, and after Jack threatens to kill them with his sword, they run away. Jack and Colm leave the place.

While Viv is looking for spare clothes for Gillian, she finds a piece of paper on the back of a picture of Gillian's mother, which has a picture of a sword on it. However, after one of

==Biography==
Avital Ronell was born in [[Prague]] to [[Israel]]i diplomats and was a performance artist before entering academia.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Juno, "Avital Ronell," in Re/Search: Angry Women 13, (Re/Search Publications, 1991), pp. 127, {{ISBN|1-890451-05-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She emigrated to New York in 1956. She attended [[Rutgers Preparatory School]] and graduated in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, ''The ÜberReader: Selected Works of Avital Ronell'', pg. 10–11, [[University of Illinois Press]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-252-07311-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young immigrant, Ronell later stated, she frequently encountered [[xenophobia]] and [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref name="Avital Ronell 2010"&gt;Avital Ronell, ''Fighting Theory: Avital Ronell in Conversation with Anne Dufourmantelle'', pg. ix, translated by Catherine Porter, [[University of Illinois Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-252-07623-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Middlebury College]], and subsequently studied with [[Jacob Taubes]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] at the Hermeneutic Institute at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. She received her [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate of philosophy]] in German studies at [[Princeton University]] in 1979, where her advisor was Stanley Corngold and her dissertation concerned self-reflection in [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], and [[Franz Kafka]].&lt;ref name="Avital Ronell 2010"/&gt; When she met [[Jacques Derrida]] at a symposium and he asked her name, she introduced herself as "Metaphysics", and he later wrote that he "found this little game rather clever."&lt;ref&gt;Benoît Peeters, ''Derrida: A Biography'', pg. 308, translated by Andrew Brown, [[Polity Press]], 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-7456-5615-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Envois," ''The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond'', pg. 196, [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|0-226-14322-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently studied with Derrida and [[Hélène Cixous]] in Paris. She went on to help introduce Derrida to American audiences by translating his essay on [[Kafka]]'s "[[Before the Law]]", his essay on the law of [[gender]]/[[genre]], his lectures on [[Nietzsche]]'s relation to [[biography]], and a number of other works.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Ear-Other-Otobiography-Transference-Translation/dp/0803265751 Amazon.com: The Ear of the Other: Otobiography, Transference, Translation: Books: Jacques Derrida, Christie McDonald, Peggy Kamuf, Avital Ronell]{{page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronell became a close friend of poet and novelist [[Pierre Alféri]], who later influenced Ronell in the titling of several of her major works.&lt;ref&gt;Benoît Peeters, ''Derrida: A Biography'', pg. 310, translated by Andrew Brown, [[Polity Press]], 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-7456-5615-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A professor at the [[University of Virginia]] for a short time period, Ronell claims she was fired because she taught [[continental philosophy]] and "went to the gym on a regular basis: [her] colleagues were shocked by this—it didn't correspond to their image of an academic woman!"&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, ''Fighting Theory: Avital Ronell in Conversation with Anne Dufourmantelle'', pg. 28–9, translated by Catherine Porter, [[University of Illinois Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-252-07623-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joined the comparative literature faculty at the [[University of California, Riverside]] and then at [[University of California, Berkeley]] where she taught with [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] and [[Judith Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, "The Rhetoric of Testing" in ''Stupidity'' (University of Illinois Press, 2002), pp. 120&lt;/ref&gt; She was a close friend of the writer [[Kathy Acker]] and identified with Acker's fiction, saying they were "destined to each other."&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, ''Kathy Goes to Hell'', pg.14, [[University of Illinois Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-252-07623-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, she moved to [[NYU|New York University]], where she co-taught a course with Jacques Derrida until 2004.

In 2009, the [[Centre Pompidou]] invited Ronell to hold an interview series with such artists and thinkers as [[Werner Herzog]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Dennis Cooper]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], and [[Suzanne Doppelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/ressource.action;jsessionid=87F25067768DB2C409256BE8998E5258?param.id=FR_R-70a5cacd536ea48a2449caec0236ced&amp;param.idSource=FR_E-9bce4d82728ec0ae1e34702c26e2e03|title=Selon...

In 2010, [[François Noudelmann]] also co-taught with her, and co-curated the Walls and Bridges program with her in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagillet.net/fileadmin/Contenus_site/Tickets/Actualites/ProgrammeWallsandBridgessaison4bd.pdf|format=PDF|title=Walls and Bridges : Season 4 :  Ideas &amp; Performances|website=Villagillet.net|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronell served as Chair to the Division of Philosophy and Literature and to the Division of Comparative Literature at the [[Modern Language Association]] from 1993 to 1996,&lt;ref name="german.as.nyu.edu avitalronell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.as.nyu.edu/object/avitalronell.html|title=Department of German|website=german.as.nyu.edu|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave a keynote address at the annual meeting of the [[American Comparative Literature Association]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acla.org/acla2012/?page_id=373|title=ACLA 2012 » Plenary Sessions|date=19 November 2011|website=Web.archive.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119000123/http://acla.org/acla2012/?page_id=373|archivedate=19 November 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=17 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of works==
Ronell argues for the necessity of the unintelligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=xVwoN2aLvL0&amp;t=9m10s}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an account of the 1992 [[Rodney King beating]], which [[Bruce Hainley]] reviewed in ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1994 as "the most illuminating essay on [[Television|TV]] and [[video]] ever written",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hainley|first=Bruce|date=November 1, 1994|title=Finitude's Score: Essays for the End of the Millenium.|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Finitude%27s+Score%3A+Essays+for+the+End+of+the+Millenium.-a016456274|journal=Artforum International|volume=|pages=|access-date=September 10, 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronell argued that the idiom of the "perfectly clear" recurrently serves as a code for the [[white lie]].&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, "TraumaTV," ''Finitude's Score: Essays for the End of the Millennium'', pg. 307, [[University of Illinois Press]], 1994, {{ISBN|0-8032-8949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of referring to herself as the [[authorship|author]] of a text, she has sometimes described herself as a "signatory," "operator," or even "television."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=xVwoN2aLvL0?t=8m50s}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sometimes focuses on thinkers who clean up after other thinkers, arguing that what she calls "sanitation departments" sometimes undermine the work they are tidying up after.&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, "The Worst Neighborhoods of the Real: Philosophy - Telephone - Contamination," in ''Finitude's Score: Essays for the End of the Millennium'' ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1994), pp. 221, {{ISBN|0-8032-8949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, she wrote one of the first critical inquiries to theorize the [[AIDS|AIDS crisis]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'' (1986)===
Ronell investigates one of Goethe's most influential works, ''[[Conversations with Goethe|Conversations with Eckermann]]'', which he did not write but instead dictated to a young schizoid companion, [[Johann Peter Eckermann|Johannes Peter Eckermann]]. Heralded by [[Nietzsche]] as "the best German book," ''[[Conversations with Goethe|Conversations with Eckermann]]'' contains Goethe's last thoughts about art, poetry, politics, religion, and the fate of [[German literature]] and [[German philosophy|philosophy]]. Ronell  reads ''[[Conversations with Goethe|Conversations with Eckermann]]'' as a return from beyond the grave of the great master of German literature and science.

Ronell starts by exploring Goethe's focus on "a certain domain of immateriality—the nonsubstantializable apparitions&amp;nbsp;... [of] weather forecasting&amp;nbsp;... ghosts, dreams, and some forms of hidden, telepathic transmissions."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Avital Ronell, "Introduction" in ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'', [[University of Illinois Press]], pg. xxii, {{ISBN|0-252-07349-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronell renames the Goethe-effect what she calls "killer texts"{{clarify|date=September 2018}} and  describes the effect as the textual machination destructive of values, of the "worthier (''Werther'', from ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'')." The first part opens on Freud's debt to Goethe and reprints the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] of ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]].'' Ronell names Goethe the "secret councilor (''Geheimrat'')" of Freud and already anticipates her work on the [[Rat Man]] in the third footnote where she alludes to the "suppository logic, inserting the vital element into the narrative of the other."&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, "Notes" in ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'', [[University of Illinois Press]], pg. 194, {{ISBN|0-252-07349-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first section Ronell aims to "attune [her] ears to the telepathic orders that Goethe's phantom transmitted to Freud by a remote control system.&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, "Part One" in ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'', [[University of Illinois Press]], pg. 5, {{ISBN|0-252-07349-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'' traces the closure without end of influence's computation.{{what|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Liliane Weissberg, "Avital Ronell, 'Dictations: On Haunted Writing' (Book Reivew)," ''Germanic Review'', 64:3 (1989:Summper), pg.136&lt;/ref&gt; Ronell's task entails a reading practice where the analysis of a text must investigate the endless movement towards closure in dictation. Ronell thus practices what is called anasemic reading, a practice developed by [[Nicolas Abraham]] and [[Maria Torok]], in which the psychoanalyst traces the textual metaphors, rhetorical structures, and linguistic associations of a writer/patient.

"Part Two" presents a case of literary parasitism between Eckermann and Goethe, and opens at the scene of Goethe's table in Weimar "the eleventh of September 1828, at two o'clock."&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, "The Pas de Deus or ''Was'' is Goethe," in ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'' ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1986), pp. 71&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Ronell re-imagines the scene that Eckermann illustrates at the beginning and ending of ''Conversations with Eckermann''. Ronell starts to address the fiction of the writer as a particularly admirable human being and argues for the necessary passivity of the writer as a human being. Ronell also troubles the notion of a body of work as a totality.&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, "The Pas de Deus or ''Was'' is Goethe," in ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'' ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1986), pp. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Ronell remaps earlier arguments about feminine appropriation in terms of writing, for Eckermann, which "involves recuperating something 'for myself,' for the most part instinctively; it entails repetitive acts of appropriation."&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, "The Pas de Deus or ''Was'' is Goethe," in ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'' ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1986), pp. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'' explores how the work of writing in general adheres to a call dictated from elsewhere, a call formative of desire.

===''The Telephone Book: Technology—Schizophrenia—Electric Speech'' (1989)===
Ronell questions the operations that such ordinary objects as the [[telephone]] and [[book]] dictate. She signs the text as the operator of the [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] alongside [[Richard Eckersley (designer)|Richard Eckersley]], operator of [[design]], and Michael Jensen, operator of [[typesetting|compositor]]. Eckersley's design departs from his "[[typography|typographic]] subtlety and restraint" towards a [[computer]] design, marked by new page-making software programs to interpret the text typographically.&lt;ref&gt;Don Mills, "Deconstructed the conventions of graphic design: Obituary of Richard Eckersley," ''National Post'', 21 April 2006: PM.11, [Toronto Edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Eckersley dislodges the text from presumed conventional settings and shifts the focus of reading with inexplicable gaps, displacements between sentences and paragraphs, mirror imaging of pages facing one another, words blurred to the point of indecipherability, and a regular exaggeration of negative line spacing, spilling sentences over into each other. Pushing the limits of an ordinary "Table of Contents" or "Footnotes," the operators set up a "[[Directory Assistance]]," in which chapters appear as reference indexes, and a yellow pages entitled "[[Classified advertising|Classified]]," in which footnotes appear as soliciting advertisements.

Following "A User's Manual," the text begins as if the reader answers a call: "And yet, you're saying yes, almost automatically, suddenly, sometimes irreversibly."&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, "Delay Call Forwarding" in ''The Telephone Book: Technology, Schizophrenia, Electric Speech'' ([[University of Nebraska Press]], 1989), pp. 2, {{ISBN|0-8032-8938-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronell makes clear that ''The Telephone Book'' is a philosophical project on questions concerning the telephone, the call, and the answering machines: "always incomplete, always unreachable, forever promising at once its essence and its existence, philosophy identifies itself finally with this promise, which is to say, with its own unreachability."&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, "Delay Call Forwarding" in ''The Telephone Book: Technology, Schizophrenia, Electric Speech'' ([[University of Nebraska Press]], 1989), pp. 3, {{ISBN|0-8032-8938-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Crack Wars: Literature, Addiction, Mania'' (1992)===
Ronell takes as her point of departure Nietzsche's articulation that, as long as culture has existed, it has supported and inspired addiction.&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, "Hits," in ''Crack Wars: Literature, Addiction, Mania'', ([[University of Nebraska Press]], 1992) pp. 3 {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8944-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often untimely, she develops an argument investigative of the destructive desires that coincide with the [[war on drugs]] and with the very [[addiction]] to drugs which the war claims to want to vanquish. The result is a text whose performance disturbs simple comprehension and frustrates any reading that wishes to tackle [[drug]]s on one side or another of a [[binary opposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Avital Ronell, "Toward a Narcoanalysis," in ''Crack Wars: Literature, Addiction, Mania'', ([[University of Nebraska Press]], 1992) pp. 50 {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8944-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronell appeals to literature as the most advanced testimony to the culture of addiction and closely reads ''[[Madame Bovary]]''.

Prior to the [[title page]], Ronell showcases quotes from [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Gustave Flaubert]] and [[Samuel Beckett]]. The text opens with a series of sixteen "hits" informative of both the structure of doing drugs and of the structure of cultural transmission. The "hits" serve as a series of references which survey the literary and philosophical landscape as relates to drugs. "Toward a Narcoanalysis" consolidates the text's itinerary to an account of the sort of analysis Ronell begins to explore by appealing to Gustave Flaubert's ''[[Madame Bovary]]''. "EB on Ice" performs a first-person account where Ronell complicates the certitude with which the reader can identify the first-person narrator as herself, as [[Madame Bovary|EB]], or being on ice as being in the [[refrigerator]], as being on [[methamphetamine]]. "Shame" highlights something like the downsizing of interpretation as it only occupies eight pages and draws the reader's attention to the possibility that the text experiments with the potential indifference between drugs and texts. "Scoring Literature" makes up the largest portion of the text and includes nineteen subsections along with a "Doctor's Report" of [[Emma Bovary|E. Bovary]]. "Cold Turkey: or, The Transcendental Aesthetic to be Eaten" is formatted as three installations, three nano-installations, and two nano-intervals of a theatrical play where Ronell convokes [[Ernst Jünger]], Martin Heidegger, [[Jacques Derrida]], Marguerite Faust, [[Marguerite Duras]], [[Freud]], [[Irma's injection|Irma]], [[voice over|Voice Off]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Thérèse of Lisieux|Saint Theresa]], [[Madame Bovary|Emma B]], [[Walter Benjamin]], chorus, priest, and delusions of a non-addict.

===''Finitude's Score: Essays for the End of the Millennium'' (1994)===
Research assistant and friend, Shireen R.K. Patell, helped bring ''Finitude's Score'' to fruition.&lt;ref name="Ronell Preface p xiv"/&gt; ''Finitude's Score'' collects a series of reflections on the fragile memory left at the close of the millennium. It looks into the projects responsible for devastating humanity and a thinking of the future.&lt;ref name="Ronell Preface p ix"&gt;Avital Ronell, "Preface," in ''Finitude's Score: Essays for the End of the Millennium'', ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1994) pp. ix, {{ISBN|0-8032-8949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronell asks why the twentieth century stakes so much on a diction of deficiency. For Ronell, it says that, "we have been depleted."&lt;ref name="Ronell Preface p ix"/&gt; Ronell traces the relegitimization of war, the philosophical status of the rumor, the questionable force of the police, the test sites of technology, the corporeal policies of disease and a thoroughgoing reconstitution of the subject of law. In sum, ''Finitude's Score'' reads the desire to finish once and for all, to be done with issues definitively, as the everlasting legacy of the [[phallogocentrism|Western logos]].&lt;ref name="Ronell Preface p xiv"/&gt;

===''Stupidity'' (2002)===
Ronell breaks down [[stupidity]]. In particular, she unfolds the complex problematic of stupidity as something that baffles [[knowledge]] in general, and therefore as something that especially baffles knowledge about itself. Among other considerations, Ronell finds that stupidity often takes the form of [[mastery]] and [[intelligence]]'s doubles. She further goes to show that stupidity does not acquire the status of [[concept]]. It only reaches the level of quasi-concept.

===''The Test Drive'' (2005)===
Inflected in the title and throughout the work is the concept of the [[Drive theory|Freudian drive]] as it inheres in the test. At the limit of the test as that which grounds scientific knowledge, Ronell questions the distinction between the [[literary science|literary]] and [[human science]]s as this distinction depends upon the constitutive limits of fiction and witnessing. Her work thus questions the structure of the [[test (assessment)|test]] as it functions to legitimate everything from [[research]] to [[love]] and [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]].

==Reception==
Ronell's work has been both praised and criticized. In 1994, the journal ''[[Diacritics (journal)|Diacritics]]'' published a special edition "On the Work of Avital Ronell",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=Winter 1994 |title=Special Section: On the Work of Avital Ronell |journal=[[Diacritics (journal)|diacritics]] |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |jstor=i219995}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Jonathan Culler]] wrote: "Over the past decade, Ronell has put together what must be one of the most remarkable critical oeuvres of our era&amp;nbsp;... Zeugmatically yoking the slang of pop culture with philosophical analysis, forcing the confrontation of high literature and technology or drug culture, Avital Ronell produces sentences that startle, irritate, illuminate.

By contrast, in a 1990 review of ''The Telephone Book'' for the ''New York Times Book Review,'' novelist [[Robert Coover]] appreciated the "visual pyrotechnics" of the book's typography but found "the argument… to be that of a fairly conventional academic paper, recognizably party-lined with fashionable Continental voices like Jacques Lacan, Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida," and found the connection that Ronell tried to establish between Heidegger, schizophrenia, and the telephone "weak."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/03/books/reach-out-and-disturb-someone.html|title=Reach Out and Disturb Someone|last=Coover|first=Robert|date=June 3, 1990|work=New York Times Book Review|access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2002 review of ''Stupidity'' for the ''Times Literary Supplement,'' philosopher [[Jonathan Rée]] said Ronell's "prose reads like a plodding translation of a French version of Heidegger, but there is hardly a sentence that does not try to stop the show to receive an ovation for its cleverness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/its-the-philosophy-stupid/|title=It's the philosophy, stupid|last=Ree|first=Jonathan|date=March 22, 2002|work=Times Literary Supplement|access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Bernd Hüppauf]], former chair of the German department at NYU who hired Ronell but was later replaced by her, has described her work as "translating incomprehensibility into pseudo-profundity."&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/09/08/a-witch-hunt-or-a-quest-for-justice-an-insiders-perspective-on-disgraced-academic-avital-ronell/|title=A witch hunt or a quest for justice: An insider’s perspective on disgraced academic Avital Ronell|last1=Hüppauf|first1=Bernd|date=8 September 2018|work=Salon|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspension for sexual harassment and pending investigation on retaliation==
In September 2017, a student, later identified as her male former graduate student Nimrod Reitman, filed a complaint in [[New York University]]’s [[Title IX]] office, accusing Ronell of sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and retaliation over the span of three years as her advisee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In May 2018, the university found Ronell responsible for sexual harassment and suspended her for the 2018–19 academic year. Ronell has not admitted any of the claims made in Reitman's complaint.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On August 16, 2018, Reitman filed a lawsuit against Ronell and the university, alleging sexual harassment, sexual assault, and stalking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Battle-Over-Alleged-Harassment/244295|title=Battle Over Alleged Harassment Escalates as Former Graduate Student Sues Professor and NYU|last=Mangan|first=Katherine|date=August 16, 2018|work=Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blancs d'Espagne''' ("Spanish Whites") was a term used to refer to those [[legitimism|legitimist]]s in France who, following the death of the [[Comte de Chambord]] in 1883, supported the Spanish [[Carlism|Carlist]] claimant rather than the [[House of Orléans|Orleanist]] candidate, who was supported by the vast majority of French royalists.

The term was generally used by supporters of the [[Philippe, Comte de Paris|Comte de Paris]], the Orleanist candidate, as a term of derision for their ultra-legitimist opponents who so hated the House of Orléans that they would support a foreign prince over an Orleanist candidate.

It is a pun on the cosmetic and cleanser known as ''blanc d'Espagne'', originally a [[white lead]] pigment and later either basic [[bismuth nitrate]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Gmelin]], [[Henry Watts (chemist)|Henry Watts]]. ''Handbook of Chemistry.'' Cavendish Society, London, 1850.&lt;/ref&gt; or a preparation made from [[chalk]] and clay.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Nouveau Petit Robert: Dictionnaire de la langue française.'' Dictionnaires le Robert, Paris, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Dropsie College===
The institution now known as the Katz Center was founded in 1907 as the '''Dropsie College of Hebrew and Cognate Learning''' and finally as '''Dropsie University'''.  It was named after its benefactor, Moses Aaron Dropsie (1821–1905),&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5331-dropsie-moses-aaron "Dropsie, Moses Aaron"] ''The Jewish Encyclopedia'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2587505418/dropsie-moses-aaron.html "Dropsie, Moses Aaron"] ''Encyclopedia.com'' website&lt;/ref&gt; a wealthy man whose father was Jewish and mother was Christian but who self-identified as Jewish from the age of 14. Dropsie willed his entire fortune to "the promotion of and instruction in the Hebrew and cognate languages and their respective literatures."

Dropsie granted more than 200 [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]s between its inception and its closing as a degree-granting institution in 1986.  Dropsie was also the publisher of the ''[[Jewish Quarterly Review]]'', which was at the time the most respected journal on the subject.

The faculty during the Dropsie era included scholars from outside the United States, including [[Benzion Netanyahu]], who came from [[Jerusalem]] with his young sons, [[Yonatan Netanyahu|Yonatan (Yoni)]] and [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Benjamin (Bibi)]], who there had their first true exposures to American culture, which would become a touchstone for later interactions with the American public for Bibi.&lt;ref name=Moyer /&gt;

===Recent history===
Although no longer a degree-granting college, it became the '''Annenberg Research Institute''' after its 1986 closing and turned into one of the country's most noted interdisciplinary post-doctoral fellowship programs. It merged with the University of Pennsylvania in 1993, after which the institution was renamed the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies.  It continues to publish the ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', the oldest continuously published Judaic studies [[Academic journal|journal]] in English.

==Fellowships==
Today, CAJS supports approximately 24 [[fellow]]s each year who conduct their research at the University of Pennsylvania.  Each fellow is given their own downtown Philadelphia office and meets with the others at weekly [[seminar]]s.  The [[Academic paper|papers]] they produce are published by the [[University of Pennsylvania Press]] at the conclusion of their term in the program.

Each year has a specific theme; scholars apply if their current research fits the annual theme. For example, for the 2005-2006 [[Academic term|academic year]], the theme was "The Jewish Book: Materials Texts and Comparative Contexts."  For 2006-2007, fellows studied "Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Life under Caliphs and Sultans."

==Library==
The combination of the Dropsie/Annenberg library along with the University of Pennsylvania's resulted in a 350,000-volume collection on Judaica, including more than 8,000 rare books and an assortment of [[cuneiform]] tablets.  Texts are available to scholars in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Latin language|Latin]].&lt;ref name="Library Legacy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiron|first=Arthur|title=The Professionalization of Wisdom: The Legacy of Dropsie College and Its Library|url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/at250/dropsie/ak.pdf|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|pages=20|format=PDF|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also 451 [[codices]] in eleven [[alphabet]]s and 24 languages and [[dialect]]s.   Some of the languages and dialects represented, in addition to those already listed, include [[Judeo-Arabic language|Judeo-Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], and [[Syriac language|Syriac]].  Fragments from the [[Cairo Genizah]] and others written in [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] on [[papyrus]] round out the collection.&lt;ref name="Library Legacy" /&gt;

The library also holds the personal letters of more than 50 [[Jewish American|Jewish-American]] leaders from the 1800s and 1900s, including [[Isaac Leeser]], [[Sabato Morais]], &amp; Abraham Neuman (three ministers of [[Congregation Mikveh Israel (Philadelphia)]]), [[Cyrus Adler]] (president: Dropsie College, Mikveh Israel, [[American Jewish Committee]], [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], librarian: [[Smithsonian Institution]]), Charles Cohen (president: Mikveh Israel, [[Fairmount Park]] Commission), his journalist sister Mary M. Cohen, Yiddish journalist Ben Zion Goldberg, and the benefactor Dropsie.&lt;ref name="Library Legacy" /&gt;

'''Climate change denial''', or '''global warming denial''', is part of the [[global warming controversy]].

The campaign to undermine public trust in climate science has been described as a "denial machine" organized by industrial, political and ideological interests, and supported by conservative media and skeptical bloggers to [[Manufactured controversy|manufacture uncertainty]] about global warming.{{sfn|Vaidyanathan|2014}}&lt;ref name="denial machine"&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlap|2013|pp=691–698}}: "From the outset, there has been an organized "[[disinformation]]" campaign… to "manufacture uncertainty" over AGW … especially by attacking climate science and scientists … waged by a loose coalition of industrial (especially fossil fuels) interests and conservative foundations and think tanks … often assisted by a small number of 'contrarian scientists. … greatly aided by conservative media and politicians … and more recently by a bevy of skeptical bloggers.

}}"Denialism is the employment of rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate, when in actuality there is none. These false arguments are used when one has few or no facts to support one's viewpoint against a scientific consensus or against overwhelming evidence to the contrary. They are effective in distracting from actual useful debate using emotionally appealing, but ultimately empty and illogical assertions. Examples of common topics in which denialists employ their tactics include: Creationism/Intelligent Design, Global Warming denialism …" and "5 general tactics are used by denialists to sow confusion.

== Terminology ==
[[File:Amardeo Sarma lecture 1 EuroSkepCon2015.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Amardeo Sarma lecturing about climate change denialism and the future world energy and environmental problems during the [[European Skeptics Congress]] 2015]]
"Climate change skepticism" and "climate change denial" refer to denial, dismissal or unwarranted doubt of the scientific consensus on the rate and extent of global warming, its significance, or its connection to human behavior, in whole or in part.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "'Climate scepticism' and 'climate denial' are readily used concepts, referring to a discourse that has become important in public debate since climate change was first put firmly on the policy agenda in 1988. This discourse challenges the views of mainstream climate scientists and environmental policy advocates, contending that parts, or all, of the scientific treatment and political interpretation of climate change are unreliable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCSE 2012 why" /&gt; Though there is a distinction between [[skepticism]] which indicates doubting the truth of an assertion and outright [[denial]] of the truth of an assertion, in the public debate phrases such as "climate scepticism" have frequently been used with the same meaning as climate denialism or [[contrarian]]ism.&lt;ref name="Nerlich 2010"&gt;{{harvnb |Nerlich |2010 |pp= 419, 437}}: "Climate scepticism in the sense of climate denialism or contrarianism is not a new phenomenon, but it has recently been very much in the media spotlight. …. Such disagreements are not new but the emails provided climate sceptics, in the sense of deniers or contrarians, with a golden opportunity to mount a sustained effort aimed at demonstrating the legitimacy of their views. This allowed them to question climate science and climate policies based on it and to promote political inaction and inertia. …. footnote 1. I shall use "climate sceptics" here in the sense of "climate deniers", although there are obvious differences between scepticism and denial (see Shermer, 2010; Kemp, et al., 2010). However, "climate sceptic" and "climate scepticism" were commonly used during the "climategate" debate as meaning "climate denier"."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Within the community of scientists and others concerned about anthropogenic climate change, those whom Inhofe calls skeptics are more commonly termed contrarians, naysayers and denialists."&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminology emerged in the 1990s. Even though all scientists adhere to [[scientific skepticism]] as an inherent part of the process, by mid November 1995 the word "skeptic" was being used specifically for the minority who publicised views contrary to the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]]. This small group of scientists presented their views in public statements and the media, rather than to the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1996|pp=9, 11}} "Indeed, the 'skeptic' scientists&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; were perceived to be all the more credible precisely ''because'' their views were contrary to the consensus of peer-reviewed science.&lt;br /&gt;14. All scientists are skeptics because the scientific process demands continuing questioning. In this report, however, the scientists we refer to as 'skeptics' are those who have taken a highly visible public role in criticizing the scientific consensus on ozone depletion and climate change through publications and statements addressed more to the media and the public than to the scientific community."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Gelbspan | 1998 |pp=69–70, 246}} At 16 November 1995 [[United States House Science Subcommittee on Energy]] hearing, [[Pat Michaels]] testified of "a small minority" opposing the IPCC assessment, and said "that the so-called skeptics were right".&lt;/ref&gt; This usage continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Antilla | 2005 | p=footnote 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his December 1995 article ''The Heat is On: The warming of the world's climate sparks a blaze of denial '', [[Ross Gelbspan]] said industry had engaged "a small band of skeptics" to confuse public opinion in a "persistent and well-funded campaign of denial".&lt;ref name="Gelbspan"&gt;{{harvnb|Gelbspan|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1997 book ''The Heat is On'' may have been the first to concentrate specifically on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "The term 'climate scepticism' emerged in around 1995, the year journalist Ross Gelbspan authored perhaps the first book focusing directly on what would retrospectively be understood as climate scepticism."&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Gelbspan discussed a "pervasive denial of global warming" in a "persistent campaign of denial and suppression" involving "undisclosed funding of these 'greenhouse skeptics'&amp;nbsp;" with "the climate skeptics" confusing the public and influencing decision makers.&lt;ref name="Gelbspan 1998"&gt;{{harvnb| Gelbspan | 1998 }} p. 3 "But some individuals do not want the public to know about the immediacy and extent of the climate threat. They have been waging a persistent campaign of denial and suppression that has been lamentably effective."&lt;br /&gt;pp. 33–34 "The campaign to keep the climate change off the public agenda involves more than the undisclosed funding of these 'greenhouse skeptics.' In their efforts to challenge the consensus scientific view….."&lt;br /&gt;p. 35 "If the climate skeptics have succeeded in confusing the general public, their influence on decision makers has been, if anything, even more effective"&lt;br /&gt; p. 173 "pervasive denial of global warming"&lt;/ref&gt;

A November 2006 [[CBC Television]] documentary on the campaign was titled "The Denial Machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CBC News: the fifth estate | 2007}}: "''The Denial Machine'' investigates the roots of the campaign to negate the science and the threat of global warming. It tracks the activities of a group of scientists, some of whom previously consulted for Big Tobacco, and who are now receiving donations from major coal and oil companies. … The documentary shows how fossil fuel corporations have kept the global warming debate alive long after most scientists believed that global warming was real and had potentially catastrophic consequences. … ''The Denial Machine'' also explores how the arguments supported by oil companies were adopted by policy makers in both Canada and the U.S. and helped form government policy."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orlóci Denial Machine"&gt;{{harvnb | Orlóci | 2008 | pp=86, 97}}: "The ideological justification for this came from the sceptics (e.g., Lomborg 2001a,b) and from the industrial 'denial machine'. … CBC Television Fifth Estate, 15 November 2006, The Climate Denial Machine, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 journalist [[Sharon Begley]] reported on the "denial machine",&lt;ref name="Begley machine" /&gt; a phrase subsequently used by academics.&lt;ref name="denial machine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orlóci Denial Machine" /&gt;

In addition to ''explicit denial'', social groups have shown ''implicit denial'' by accepting the scientific consensus, but failing to come to terms with its implications or take action to reduce the problem.&lt;ref name="NCSE implicit"&gt;{{harvnb|National Center for Science Education|2012}}: "Climate change denial is most conspicuous when it is explicit, as it is in controversies over climate education. The idea of implicit (or "implicatory") denial, however, is increasingly discussed among those who study the controversies over climate change. Implicit denial occurs when people who accept the scientific community's consensus on the answers to the central questions of climate change on the intellectual level fail to come to terms with it or to translate their acceptance into action. Such people are in denial, so to speak, about climate change."&lt;/ref&gt; This was exemplified in [[Kari Norgaard]]'s study of a village in [[Norway]] affected by climate change, where residents diverted their attention to other issues.&lt;ref name="Norgaard 2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life|last=Norgaard|first=Kari|publisher=MIT Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-262-01544-8|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=1–4|authorlink=Kari Norgaard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminology is debated: most of those actively rejecting the scientific consensus use the terms ''skeptic'' and ''climate change skepticism'', and only a few have expressed preference for being described as deniers,&lt;ref name="NCSE 2012 why"&gt;{{harvnb|National Center for Science Education|2012}}: "There is debate…about how to refer to the positions that reject, and to the people who doubt or deny, the scientific community's consensus on…climate change. Many such people prefer to call themselves skeptics and describe their position as climate change skepticism. Their opponents, however, often prefer to call such people climate change deniers and to describe their position as climate change denial… "Denial" is the term preferred even by many deniers."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington p2"&gt;{{harvnb|Washington|2013|p=2}}: "Many climate change deniers call themselves climate 'skeptics'…However, refusing to accept the overwhelming 'preponderance of evidence' is not skepticism, it is ''denial'' and should be called by its true name… The use of the term 'climate skeptic' is a distortion of reality…Skepticism is healthy in both science and society; denial is not."&lt;/ref&gt; but the word "skepticism" is incorrectly used, as [[scientific skepticism]] is an intrinsic part of scientific methodology.&lt;ref name="O'Neill Boykoff 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael E. |title=The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines |isbn=978-0-231-52638-8 |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2013 |quote=Skepticism plays an essential role in the progress of science… Yet…in the context of the climate change denial movement… the term ''skeptic'' has often been co-opted to describe those who simply deny, rather than appraise critically.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|2015|p=229}}: "many who deny the consensus on climate change are not really skeptics but rather contrarians who practice "a kind of one-sided skepticism that entails simply rejecting evidence that challenges one's preconceptions" (Mann 2012:26)"&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''contrarian'' is more specific, but used less frequently. In academic literature and journalism, the terms ''climate change denial'' and ''climate change deniers'' have well established usage as descriptive terms without any pejorative intent. Both the [[National Center for Science Education]] and historian [[Spencer R. Weart]] recognise that either option is problematic, but have decided to use "climate change denial" rather than "skepticism".&lt;ref name="NCSEpreference"&gt;{{harvnb|National Center for Science Education|2012}}: "Recognizing that no terminological choice is entirely unproblematic, NCSE — in common with a number of scholarly and journalistic observers of the social controversies surrounding climate change — opts to use the terms "climate changer deniers" and "climate change denial""&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}} [http://www.aip.org/history/climate/public2.htm#N_136a_ footnote 136a]: "I do not mean to use the term "denier" pejoratively—it has been accepted by some of the group as a self-description—but simply to designate those who deny any likelihood of future danger from anthropogenic global warming."&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, an open letter from the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] called on the media to stop using the term "skepticism" when referring to climate change denial. They contrasted scientific skepticism—which is "foundational to the scientific method"—with denial—"the a priori rejection of ideas without objective consideration"—and the behavior of those involved in political attempts to undermine climate science. They said "Not all individuals who call themselves climate change skeptics are deniers. But virtually all deniers have falsely branded themselves as skeptics.

The executive director of the [[Society of Environmental Journalists]] said that while there was reasonable skepticism about specific issues, she felt that denier was "the most accurate term when someone claims there is no such thing as global warming, or agrees that it exists but denies that it has any cause we could understand or any impact that could be measured."&lt;ref name="MMfA 20150622"&gt;{{cite web | title=NY Times Public Editor: We're "Moving In A Good Direction" On Properly Describing Climate Deniers | website=Media Matters for America | date=22 June 2015 | url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/06/22/ny-times-public-editor-were-moving-in-a-good-di/204089 | accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|History of climate change science}}
Research on the effect of [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] on the climate began in 1824, when [[Joseph Fourier]] inferred the existence the atmospheric "[[greenhouse effect]]". In 1860, [[John Tyndall]] quantified the effects of greenhouse gases on absorption of infrared radiation. [[Svante Arrhenius]] in 1896 showed that coal burning could cause global warming, and in 1938 [[Guy Stewart Callendar]] found it already happening to some extent.&lt;ref name="conwayoreskes170"&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|Oreskes|2010|p=170}}: "The doubts and confusion of the American people are particularly peculiar when put into historical perspective"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="powell36"&gt;{{harvnb|Powell|2012|pp=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research advanced rapidly after 1940; from 1957, [[Roger Revelle]] alerted the public to risks that fossil fuel burning was "a grandiose scientific experiment" on climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015a}}: "From the late 1940s into the 1960s, many of the papers cited in these essays carried a thought-provoking footnote: "This work was supported by the '[[Office of Naval Research]].'&amp;nbsp;"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] took on research, the 1979 [[Jule Gregory Charney|Charney Report]] concluded that substantial warming was already on the way, and "A wait-and-see policy may mean waiting until it is too late."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015a}}: quote p. viii in the Foreword by Climate Research Board chair [[Verner E.

In 1959 a scientist working for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] suggested in a [[New Scientist]] article, that carbon cycles are too vast to upset Nature's balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/us-firms-knew-about-global-warming-in-1968-what-about-australia-57878|work=The Conversation|year=2016|title=US firms knew about global warming in 1968 – what about Australia?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to increasing public awareness of the greenhouse effect in the 1970s, conservative reaction built up, denying environmental concerns which could lead to government regulation. With the 1981 [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan]], global warming became a political issue, with immediate plans to cut spending on environmental research, particularly climate related, and stop funding for {{co2}} monitoring. Reagan appointed as [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] [[James B. Edwards]], who said that there was no real global warming problem. Congressman [[Al Gore]] had studied under Revelle and was aware of the developing science: he joined others in arranging congressional hearings from 1981 onwards, with testimony by scientists including Revelle, [[Stephen Schneider]] and [[Wallace Smith Broecker]]. The hearings gained enough public attention to reduce the cuts in atmospheric research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015a}}: [https://www.aip.org/history/climate/Govt.htm#S7 Global Warming Becomes a Political Issue (1980–1983)]; "In 1981, Ronald Reagan took the presidency with an administration that openly scorned their concerns. He brought with him a backlash that had been building against the environmental movement. Many conservatives denied nearly every environmental worry, global warming included. They lumped all such concerns together as the rants of business-hating liberals, a Trojan Horse for government regulation." For details, see [https://www.aip.org/history/climate/Kfunds.htm#M_29_ Money for Keeling: Monitoring CO2]&lt;/ref&gt; A polarized party-political debate developed. In 1982 [[Sherwood B. Idso]] published his book ''Carbon Dioxide: Friend or Foe?'' which said increases in {{co2}} would not warm the planet, but would fertilize crops and were "something to be encouraged and not suppressed", while complaining that his theories had been rejected by the "scientific establishment". An [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) report in 1983 said global warming was "not a theoretical problem but a threat whose effects will be felt within a few years", with potentially "catastrophic" consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Discovery of Global Warming|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qX8yCpETS-IC&amp;pg=PA141|publisher = Harvard University Press|date = 30 June 2009|isbn = 978-0-674-04497-5|first = Spencer R.|last = Weart}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reagan administration reacted by calling the report "alarmist", and the dispute got wide news coverage. Public attention turned to other issues, then the 1985 finding of a polar [[Ozone depletion|ozone hole]] brought a swift international response. To the public, [[ozone depletion and climate change|this was related to climate change]] and the possibility of effective action, but news interest faded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: [https://www.aip.org/history/climate/public2.htm#L_0400 Breaking into Politics (1980–1988)], "Sherwood Idso, who published arguments that greenhouse gas emissions would not warm the Earth or bring any other harm to climate. Better still, by fertilizing crops, the increase of CO2 would bring tremendous benefits."&lt;/ref&gt;

Public attention was renewed amidst summer droughts and heat waves when [[James Hansen]] testified to a Congressional hearing on 23 June 1988,&lt;ref name="Hansen testimony"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hansen|first1=James|title=Statement of Dr. James Hansen, director, NASA Goddard Institute for space studies|year=1988|url=http://climatechange.procon.org/sourcefiles/1988_Hansen_Senate_Testimony.pdf|website=Climate Change ProCon.org|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating with high confidence that long term warming was under way with severe warming likely within the next 50 years, and warning of likely storms and floods. There was increasing media attention: the scientific community had reached a broad consensus that the climate was warming, human activity was very likely the primary cause, and there would be significant consequences if the warming trend was not curbed.&lt;ref name="earlyconsensus"&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}} [https://www.aip.org/history/climate/public2.htm#S1988 The Summer of 1988]: "A new breed of interdisciplinary studies was showing that even a few degrees of warming might have harsh consequences, both for fragile natural ecosystems and for certain agricultural systems and other human endeavours …. The timing was right, and the media leaped on the story. Hansen's statements, especially that severe warming was likely within the next 50 years, got on the front pages of newspapers and were featured in television news and radio talk shows…. The story grew as the summer of 1988 wore on. Reporters descended unexpectedly upon an international conference of scientists held in Toronto at the end of June. Their stories prominently reported how the world's leading climate scientists declared that atmospheric changes were already causing harm, and might cause much more; the scientists called for vigorous government action to restrict greenhouse gases."&lt;/ref&gt; These facts encouraged discussion about new laws concerning environmental regulation, which was opposed by the fossil fuel industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "Environmentalist organizations continued… lobbying and advertising efforts to argue for restrictions on emissions. The environmentalists were opposed, and greatly outspent, by industries that produced or relied on fossil fuels. Industry groups not only mounted a sustained and professional public relations effort, but also channeled considerable sums of money to individual scientists and small conservative organizations and publications that denied any need to act against global warming."&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1989 onwards industry funded organisations including the [[Global Climate Coalition]] and the [[George C. Marshall Institute]] sought to spread doubt among the public, in a strategy already developed by the tobacco industry.&lt;ref name="tobacco-approach" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "The technical criticism most widely noted in the press came in several brief "reports"—not scientific papers in the usual sense—published between 1989 and 1992 by the conservative George C. Marshall Institute. The anonymously authored pamphlets … [claimed] that proposed government regulation would be "extraordinarily costly to the U.S. economy," they insisted it would be unwise to act on the basis of the existing global warming theories … In 1989 some of the biggest corporations in the petroleum, automotive, and other industries created a Global Climate Coalition, whose mission was to disparage every call for action against global warming."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tobacco-docs"&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|Oreskes|2010}}: "Millions of pages of documents released during tobacco litigation … show the crucial role that scientists played in sowing doubt about the links between smoking and health risks. These documents … also show that the same strategy was applied not only to global warming, but to a laundry list of environmental and health concerns, including asbestos, secondhand smoke, acid rain, and the ozone hole."&lt;/ref&gt; A small group of scientists opposed to the consensus on global warming became politically involved, and with support from conservative political interests, began publishing in books and the press rather than in scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "Scientists noticed something that the public largely overlooked: the most outspoken scientific critiques of global warming predictions did not appear in the standard peer-reviewed scientific publications. The critiques tended to appear in venues funded by industrial groups, or in conservative media like the Wall Street Journal."&lt;/ref&gt; This small group of scientists included some of the same people that were part of the strategy already tried by the tobacco industry.&lt;ref name="merchants of doubt"/&gt; [[Spencer Weart]] identifies this period as the point where legitimate skepticism about basic aspects of climate science was no longer justified, and those spreading mistrust about these issues became deniers.&lt;ref name="Weart p46"&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2011|p=46}}: "Scientists continually test their beliefs, seeking out all possible contrary arguments and evidence, and finally publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals, where further attempts at refutation are encouraged. But the small group of scientists who opposed the consensus on warming proceeded in the manner of lawyers, considering nothing that would not bolster their case, and publishing mostly in pamphlets, books, and newspapers supported by conservative interests. At some point they were no longer skeptics—people who would try to see every side of a case—but deniers, that is, people whose only interest was in casting doubt upon what other scientists agreed was true."&lt;/ref&gt; As their arguments were increasingly refuted by the scientific community and new data, deniers turned to political arguments, making personal attacks on the reputation of scientists, and promoting ideas of a [[Global warming conspiracy theory|global warming conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2011|pp=47}}: "As the deniers found ever less scientific ground to stand on, they turned to political arguments. Some of these policy arguments were straightforward, raising serious questions about the efficacy and expense of proposed carbon taxes and emission-regulation schemes. But leading deniers also resorted toad hominem tactics… On each side, some people were coming to believe that they faced a dishonest conspiracy, driven by ideological bias and naked self-interest"&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 fall of communism]] and the [[environmental movement]]'s international reach at the [[Earth Summit|1992 Rio Earth Summit]], the attention of [[Conservatism in the United States#Think tanks and foundations|U.S. conservative think tanks]], which had been organised in the 1970s as an intellectual counter-movement to socialism, turned from the "red scare" to the "green scare" which they saw as a threat to their aims of private property, free trade market economies and global capitalism. As a counter-movement, they used [[environmental skepticism]] to promote denial of the reality of problems such as loss of [[biodiversity]] and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|Dunlap|Freeman|2008|pp=349–385}}: "Environmental scepticism encompasses several themes, but denial of the authenticity of environmental problems, particularly problems such as [[biodiversity loss]] or climate change that threaten ecological sustainability, is its defining feature"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, an EPA report linked [[Passive smoking|second-hand smoke]] with lung cancer. The tobacco industry engaged the [[APCO Worldwide]] public relations company, which set out a strategy of [[astroturfing]] campaigns to cast doubt on the science by linking smoking anxieties with other issues, including global warming, in order to turn public opinion against calls for government intervention. The campaign depicted public concerns as "unfounded fears" supposedly based only on "junk science" in contrast to their "sound science", and operated through [[front organization|front groups]], primarily the [[Advancement of Sound Science Center]] (TASSC) and its Junk Science website, run by [[Steven Milloy]]. A tobacco company memo commented "Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy." During the 1990s, the tobacco campaign died away, and TASSC began taking funding from oil companies including Exxon. Its website became central in distributing "almost every kind of climate-change denial that has found its way into the popular press."&lt;ref name="requiem"&gt;{{harv|Hamilton|2011|pp=104–106}}: "the tactics, personnel and organisations mobilised to serve the interests of the tobacco lobby in the 1980s were seamlessly transferred to serve the interests of the fossil-fuel lobby in the 1990s. [[Frederick Seitz]] … the task of the climate sceptics in the think tanks and PR companies hired by fossil fuel companies was to engage in 'consciousness lowering activities', to 'de-problematise' global warming by describing it as a form of politically driven panicmongering." For the tobacco company memo, see {{cite web|url= http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/wjh13f00|title= Original "Doubt is our product…" memo|date= 21 August 1969|publisher= University of California, San Francisco|accessdate= 19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the Marshall Institute began campaigning against increased regulations on environmental issues such as [[acid rain]], [[ozone depletion]], second-hand smoke, and the dangers of [[DDT]].&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="requiem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="merchants of doubt"&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|Oreskes|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case their argument was that the science was too uncertain to justify any government intervention, a strategy it borrowed from earlier efforts to downplay the health effects of tobacco in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="tobacco-approach" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tobacco-docs" /&gt; This campaign would continue for the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|Oreskes|2010|p=105}}: "As recently as 2007, the George Marshall Institute continued to insist that the damages associated with acid rain were always "largely hypothetical," and that "further scientific investigation revealed that most of them were not in fact occurring." The Institute cited no studies to support this extraordinary claim."&lt;/ref&gt;

These efforts succeeded in influencing public perception of climate science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "Public support for environmental concerns in general seems to have waned after 1988."&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1988 and the 1990s, public discourse shifted from the science and data of climate change to discussion of politics and surrounding controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "A study of American media found that in 1987 most items that mentioned the greenhouse effect had been feature stories about the science, whereas in 1988 the majority of the stories addressed the politics of the controversy. It was not that the number of science stories declined, but rather that as media coverage doubled and redoubled, the additional stories moved into social and political areas … Before 1988, the journalists had drawn chiefly on scientists for their information, but afterward they relied chiefly on sources who were identified with political positions or special interest groups."&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign to spread doubt continued into the 1990s, including an advertising campaign funded by [[coal industry]] advocates intended to "reposition global warming as theory rather than fact,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wald|first=Matthew L.|title=Pro-Coal Ad Campaign Disputes Warming Idea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/08/business/pro-coal-ad-campaign-disputes-warming-idea.html|accessdate=1 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Begley|2007}}: "Individual companies and industry associations—representing petroleum, steel, autos and utilities, for instance—formed lobbying groups … [the Information Council on the Environment's] game plan called for enlisting greenhouse doubters to "reposition global warming as theory rather than fact," and to sow doubt about climate research just as cigarette makers had about smoking research … The coal industry's Western Fuels Association paid Michaels to produce a newsletter called World Climate Report, which has regularly trashed mainstream climate science."&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1998 proposal written by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] intending to recruit scientists to convince politicians, the media and the public that climate science was too uncertain to warrant environmental regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cox |first=Robert |year=2009 |title=Environmental Communication and the Public Sphere |publisher=Sage |pages=311–312 |quote=to recruit a cadre of scientists who share the industry's views of climate science and to train them in public relations so they can help convince journalists, politicians and the public that the risk of global warming is too uncertain to justify controls on greenhouse gases}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal included a [[US$]]&amp;nbsp;5,000,000 multi-point strategy to "maximize the impact of scientific views consistent with ours on [[U.S. Congress|Congress]], the media and other key audiences", with a goal of "raising questions about and undercutting the 'prevailing scientific wisdom'".&lt;ref&gt;Cushman, John, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/26/us/industrial-group-plans-to-battle-climate-treaty.html?scp=2&amp;sq=climate%20science%20and%20to%20train%20them%20&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=print "Industrial Group Plans to Battle Climate Treaty"], ''The New York Times'', 25 April 1998.

In 1998, Gelbspan noted that his fellow journalists accepted that global warming was occurring, but said they were in "'stage-two' denial of the climate crisis", unable to accept the feasibility of answers to the problem.{{sfn | Gelbspan | 1998 | pp=3, 35, 46, 197}} A subsequent book by Milburn and Conrad on ''The Politics of Denial'' described "economic and psychological forces" producing denial of the consensus on global warming issues.&lt;ref name="MilburnConrad1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael A.

These efforts by climate change denial groups were recognized as an organized campaign beginning in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "Academics took note of the discourse when they began to analyse media representations of climate change knowledge and its effect on public perceptions and policy-making, but in the 1990s, they did not yet focus on it as a coherent and defined phenomenon.

Through advertisements, op-eds, lobbying and media attention, greenhouse doubters (they hate being called deniers) argued first that the world is not warming; measurements indicating otherwise are flawed, they said. Then they claimed that any warming is natural, not caused by human activities. Now they contend that the looming warming will be minuscule and harmless. 'They patterned what they did after the tobacco industry,' says former senator Tim Wirth"&lt;/ref&gt;

Referencing work of sociologists Robert Antonio and [[Robert Brulle]], Wayne A.

The number of these climate sceptics is greater in the US than in any other country. Although the peer-reviewed scientific literature agrees with the IPCC, within the media—wherefrom the majority of adults in the US are informed about science—claims that are dismissive of anthropogenic climate change are prominently featured."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the media, the contrarian movement has also been sustained by the growth of the internet, having gained some of its support from internet bloggers, talk radio hosts and newspaper columnists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|2015|p=243}}: "the community of climate change contrarians also includes a host of amateurs, from talk radio hosts to newspaper columnists to bloggers.

== Denial networks ==
===United States===
{{further|Climate change policy of the United States}}
A poll conducted by the New York Times Magazine in 2006 found that only 56% of Americans believe that average global temperatures have risen even though scientists think that they have. A majority of Americans also believe that scientists are still divided on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;DiMento, J. and Doughman, P. (2017). Climate Change: What it Means for Us, Our Children, and Our Grandchildren. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp. 25-29. &lt;/ref&gt;

A study was conducted to determine whether or not conservative [[white Americans]] were more likely to deny climate change.  Researchers from [[Lyman Briggs College]] took samples of conservative white males of different understandings of global warming and categorized them separately.  Categorized into three groups:  conservative white males who claim to understand global warming, conservative white males who claim not to understand global warming, and other individuals.  It was concluded that many of these conservative white males who self-report understanding global warming believe that the mass media has over exaggerated the effects of global warming and climate change and that the effects of it have never happened.  48.4% of conservative white males who report understanding global warming very well in the study said that the effects of global warming will never happen compared to 19% who do not understand it very well and 7.4% of all other adults. Many people appear to be confused by [[climate science]] however, the study showed that the people who self reported understanding global warming were most prone to denying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCright|first=Aaron M.|last2=Dunlap|first2=Riley E.|date=1 October 2011|title=Cool dudes: The denial of climate change among conservative white males in the United States|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937801100104X|journal=Global Environmental Change|volume=21|issue=4|pages=1163–1172|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study by [[Utah State University]] discusses geographic variation on climate change opinions at state and local scales in the United States. It was noted that prior research was found that public climate change policy support and behavior are significantly influenced by public beliefs, attitudes and risk perceptions. In addition, to complement previous stated factors, they're also influenced by knowledge, emotion, ideology, demographics, and personal experience. Where people live can account for some significance, since some people live in weather extreme areas, they could be desensitized to the overall change in climates as well.  Surveys were conducted and showed that 63% of Americans believe that global warming is happening, 47% believe that it is human caused and 42% believe that most scientists think it is happening. In the study, a model was constructed to determine the public opinion of climate change across the nation. Representative telephone based surveys were used to investigate opinions in four states: California, Texas, Ohio and Colorado in addition to the Columbus and San Francisco metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howe|first=Peter D.|last2=Mildenberger|first2=Matto|last3=Marlon|first3=Jennifer R.|last4=Leiserowitz|first4=Anthony|date=1 January 2015|title=Geographic variation in opinions on climate change at state and local scales in the USA|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2bz0416w|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=en|volume=5|issue=6|pages=596–603|doi=10.1038/nclimate2583|issn=1758-678X|bibcode=2015NatCC...5..596H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it had been the case as of 2010 that more than two-thirds of television weathercasters had denied that warming was real and largely caused by human activity, as of March 2018 the rate of acceptance among TV forecasters that the climate is changing has increased to ninety-five percent. The number of local television stories about global warming has also increased, by fifteen-fold. [[Climate Central]] has received some of the credit for this because they provide classes for meteorologists and graphics for television stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morrison |first1=David |authorlink1=David Morrison (astrophysicist) |title=Some Good News on Climate: A Big Shift among TV Weathercasters |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |year=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments and positions on global warming ==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Karl 15 Temps before and after corrxnx.png|thumb|320px|Temperature anomalies in an updated NOAA dataset show a continuing upward trend, with no evidence that global warming has recently stopped, as has been alleged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/science/noaa-research-presents-evidence-against-a-global-warming-hiatus.html Global Warming 'Hiatus' Challenged by NOAA Research], ''The New York Times'', 4 June 2015.    Quote:  Russell S. Vose, chief of the climate science division at NOAA's Asheville center, pointed out in an interview that while the corrections do eliminate the recent warming slowdown, the overall effect of the agency's adjustments has long been to raise the reported global temperatures in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by a substantial margin. That makes the temperature increase of the past century appear less severe than it does in the raw data. If you just wanted to release to the American public our uncorrected data set, it would say that the world has warmed up about 2.071 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880," Dr. Vose said. "Our corrected data set says things have warmed up about 1.65 degrees Fahrenheit. Our corrections lower the rate of warming on a global scale."&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

Some climate change denial groups say that because {{CO2}} is only a trace gas in the atmosphere (roughly 400ppm, or 0.04%) it can only have a minor effect on the climate. Scientists have known for over a century that even this small proportion has a significant warming effect, and doubling the proportion leads to a large temperature increase.&lt;ref name="trace"&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 1: Anthropogenic CO2 can't be changing climate, because CO2 is only a trace gas in the atmosphere and the amount produced by humans is dwarfed by the amount from volcanoes and other natural sources. Water vapor is by far the most important greenhouse gas, so changes in CO2 are irrelevant."&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific consensus, as summarized by the IPCC's fourth assessment report, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other reports, is that human activity is the leading cause of climate change. The burning of fossil fuels accounts for around 30 billion tons of {{CO2}} each year, which is 130 times the amount produced by volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: " According to the U.S. Geological Survey, anthropogenic CO2 amounts to about 30 billion tons annually—more than 130 times as much as volcanoes produce."&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups allege that water vapor is a more significant greenhouse gas, and is left out of many climate models.&lt;ref name="trace" /&gt; While water vapor is a [[greenhouse gas]], the very short atmospheric lifetime of water vapor (about 10 days) compared that of {{CO2}} (hundreds of years) means that  {{CO2}} is the primary driver of increasing temperatures; water vapour acts as a feedback, not a forcing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/04/water-vapour-feedback-or-forcing/|title=Water vapour: feedback or forcing?|date=6 April 2005|website=RealClimate|first=David|last=Archer|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Water vapor has been incorporated into climate models since their inception in the late 1800s. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "from Arrhenius on, climatologists have incorporated water vapor into their models. In fact, water vapor is why rising CO2 has such a big effect on climate… Nevertheless, within this dynamic, the CO2 remains the main driver… of the greenhouse effect."&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate denial groups may also argue that global warming stopped recently, a [[global warming hiatus]], or that global temperatures are actually decreasing, leading to [[global cooling]]. These arguments are based on short term fluctuations, and ignore the long term pattern of warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 3: Global warming stopped a decade ago; Earth has been cooling since then."&lt;/ref&gt;

These groups often point to natural variability, such as sunspots and cosmic rays, to explain the warming trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 4: The sun or cosmic rays are much more likely to be the real causes of global warming. After all, Mars is warming up, too."&lt;/ref&gt; According to these groups, there is natural variability that will abate over time, and human influences have little to do with it. These factors are already taken into account when developing climate models, and the scientific consensus is that they cannot explain the observed warming trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "But in defiance of the naysayers who want to chalk the recent warming up to natural cycles, there is insufficient evidence that enough extra solar energy is reaching our planet to account for the observed rise in global temperatures."&lt;/ref&gt;

At a May 2018 meeting of the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology]], Alabama's Representative [[Mo Brooks]] claimed that sea level rise is caused not by melting glaciers but rather by coastal erosion and silt that flows from rivers into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waldman|first1=Scott|title=Republican lawmaker: Rocks tumbling into ocean causing sea level rise|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/republican-lawmaker-rocks-tumbling-ocean-causing-sea-level-rise|accessdate=17 May 2018|publisher=Science|date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change denial literature often features the suggestion that we should wait for better technologies before addressing climate change, when they will be more affordable and effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 7: Technological fixes, such as inventing energy sources that don't produce CO2 or geoengineering the climate, would be more affordable, prudent ways to address climate change than reducing our carbon footprint."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conspiracy theories ===
Global warming conspiracy theories have been posited which allege that the scientific consensus is illusory, or that climatologists are acting on their own financial interests by causing undue alarm about a changing climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 5: Climatologists conspire to hide the truth about global warming by locking away their data. Their so-called "consensus" on global warming is scientifically irrelevant because science isn't settled by popularity.... Claim 6: Climatologists have a vested interest in raising the alarm because it brings them money and prestige."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plot"&gt;{{cite book |title=Climate Change from a Criminological Perspective |last=White |first=Rob |isbn=978-1-4614-3640-9 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgzIl7LvUVIC&amp;pg=PA48 |page=49 |quote=many Americans, including many American politicians and decision-makers, are increasingly viewing climate change as a "left-wing plot"–part of the "one-world socialist agenda" or a "conspiracy to impose world government and a sweeping redistribution of wealth."

In 2012, research by [[Stephan Lewandowsky]] (then of the [[University of Western Australia]]) concluded that belief in other conspiracy theories, such as that the FBI was responsible for the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination#Allegations of conspiracy|assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]], was associated with being more likely to endorse climate change denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lewandowsky | first1 = Stephan | last2 = Oberauer | first2 = Klaus | year = 2013 | title = NASA Faked the Moon Landing—Therefore, (Climate) Science Is a Hoax | journal = [[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]] | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 622–633 | jstor =  | doi = 10.1177/0956797612457686 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | pmid=23531484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxonomy of climate change denial ===
[[File:5 Characteristics of Science Denial-en.png|thumb|Characteristics of science denial (including climate science denial)]]
In 2004 [[Stefan Rahmstorf]] described how the media give the misleading impression that climate change was still disputed within the scientific community, attributing this impression to PR efforts of climate change skeptics. He identified different positions argued by climate skeptics, which he used as a [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of climate change skepticism:&lt;ref name="Rahmstorf 2004"&gt;Rahmstorf, S., 2004, [http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Other/rahmstorf_climate_sceptics_2004.pdf The climate sceptics: Weather Catastrophes and Climate Change—Is There Still Hope For Us?] (Munich: PG Verlag) pp 76–83 [note: numbering not shown in original]&lt;/ref&gt; Later the model was also applied on denial.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

{{quotation|
# Trend sceptics/deniers (who deny there is global warming), [and] argue that no significant climate warming is taking place at all, claiming that the warming trend measured by weather stations is an artefact due to urbanisation around those stations ("[[urban heat island]] effect").
# Attribution sceptics/deniers (who accept the global warming trend but see natural causes for this), [and] doubt that human activities are responsible for the observed trends. A few of them even deny that the rise in the atmospheric {{CO2}} content is anthropogenic [while others argue that] additional {{CO2}} does not lead to discernible warming [and] that there must be other—natural—causes for warming.
# Impact sceptics/deniers (who think global warming is harmless or even beneficial). |&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rahmstorf 2004" /&gt; }}
This taxonomy has been used in [[social science]] for analysis of publications, and to categorize climate change skepticism and climate change denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "We focused on the marked differences in what climate sceptics are sceptical about … (1) trend sceptics (who deny the global warming trend), (2) attribution sceptics (who accept the trend, but either question the anthropogenic contribution saying it is overstated, negligent or non-existent compared to other factors like natural variation, or say it is not known with sufficient certainty what the main causes are) and (3) impact sceptics (who accept human causation, but claim impacts may be benign or beneficial, or that the models are not robust enough) and/or question the need for strong regulatory policies or interventions. "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunlap Jacques 2013 p. 702"&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlap|Jacques|2013|p=702}}: "These books reject evidence that global warming is occurring, that human actions are the predominant cause of global warming, and/or that global warming will have negative impacts on human and natural systems. These arguments have been labelled trend, attribution, and impact denial (Rahmstorf, 2004). … We located 108 books espousing one or more of these versions of climate change denial published through 2010"&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, a fourth category called "consensus denial" is added, which describes people who question the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The National Center for Science Education describes climate change denial as disputing differing points in the scientific consensus, a sequential range of arguments from denying the occurrence of climate change, accepting that but denying any significant human contribution, accepting these but denying scientific findings on how this would affect nature and human society, to accepting all these but denying that humans can mitigate or reduce the problems.&lt;ref name="ncse-pillars"&gt;{{harvnb|National Center for Science Education|2010}}: "The first pillar of climate change denial—that climate change is bad science—attacks various aspects of the scientific consensus about climate change … there are climate change deniers:
* who deny that significant climate change is occurring
* who … deny that human activity is significantly responsible
* who … deny the scientific evidence about its significant effects on the world and our society …
* who … deny that humans can take significant actions to reduce or mitigate its impact.
Of these varieties of climate change denial, the most visible are the first and the second."&lt;/ref&gt; [[James L. Powell]] provides a more extended list,&lt;ref name="Powell2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Powell|2012|pp=170–173}}: "Anatomy of Denial—Global warming deniers…. throw up a succession of claims, and fall back from one line of defense to the next as scientists refute each one in turn.

According to McKibben, the President has also "opened huge swaths of the [[Powder River basin]] to new coal mining."

Various groups, including the National Center for Science Education, have described climate change denial as a form of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="NCSE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/climate-change-101/ncse-tackles-climate-change-denial |website=[[National Center for Science Education]] |date=13 January 2012 |title=NCSE Tackles Climate Change Denial |accessdate=5 July 2015 |quote=Science education is under attack… by climate change deniers, who ignore a mountain of evidence gathered over the last fifty years that the planet is warming and that humans are largely responsible.

That is, the collection of original data, construction of new mathematical techniques, and generation and validation of testable hypotheses have been the hallmarks of the traditional scientific community… On the other hand, the emerging culture profiled in these hearings emphasizes the generation of new perspectives. Productivity is measured on the ability to alter public opinion – through opinion pieces aimed not at their fellow scientists but at policymakers, the media, and the general public – and funding flows accordingly."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In his final chapter, Gordin turns to the new phase of pseudoscience, practiced by a few rogue scientists themselves.

== Public opinion ==
{{Main|Public opinion on climate change}}
Public opinion on climate change is significantly impacted by [[media coverage of climate change]], and the effects of climate change denial campaigns. Campaigns to undermine public confidence in climate science have decreased public belief in climate change, which in turn have impacted legislative efforts to curb {{CO2}} emissions.&lt;ref name="disinformation" /&gt;

The popular media in the U.S. gives greater attention to climate change skeptics than the scientific community as a whole, and the level of agreement within the scientific community has not been accurately communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = M.| first2 = J.| title = Balance as bias: global warming and the US prestige press| last1 = Boykoff| journal = Global Environmental Change Part A| volume = 14| issue = 2| pages = 125–136| date = July 2004| doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001| last2 = Boykoff| url = http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/boykoff04-gec.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151106081048/http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/boykoff04-gec.pdf| archivedate = 6 November 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antilla|2005}}: "One problematic trend of the US media has been the suggestion that substantive disagreement exists within the international scientific community as to the reality of anthropogenic climate change; however, this concept is false…Although the science of climate change does not appear to be a prime news topic for most of the 255 newspapers included in this study…articles that framed climate change in terms of debate, controversy, or uncertainty were plentiful."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "Media analysis of climate change reporting was always of interest to academics but from the mid-2000s, it became one of the key areas of research interest, highlighting a tendency to give undue weight to voices questioning the science of climate change."&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, news outlets have allowed climate change skeptics to explain the science of climate change instead of experts in climatology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antilla|2005}}: "Not only were there many examples of journalistic balance that led to bias, but some of the news outlets repeatedly used climate sceptics—with known fossil fuel industry ties—as primary definers"&lt;/ref&gt; US and [[UK]] media coverage differ from that presented in other countries, where reporting is more consistent with the scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Media's social construction of environmental issues: focus on global warming – a comparative study |issn=0144-333X |journal=[[International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy]] |volume=23 |issue=10 |last1=Dispensa |first1=Jaclyn Marisa |last2=Brulle |first2=Robert J. |authorlink2=Robert Brulle |doi=10.1108/01443330310790327 |pages=74–105|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "news coverage of scepticism is mostly limited to the USA and the UK…the type of sceptics who question whether global temperatures are warming are almost exclusively found in the US and UK newspapers.

A study assessed the public perception and actions to climate change, on grounds of belief systems, and identified seven psychological barriers affecting the behavior that otherwise would facilitate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental stewardship.

== Nationalism ==
It has been suggested that climate change can conflict with a [[nationalism|nationalistic]] view because it is "unsolvable" at the national level and requires collective action between nations or between local communities, and that therefore populist nationalism tends to reject the science of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate denial and the populist right|url=https://www.iied.org/climate-denial-populist-right|website=International Institute for Environment and Development|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lobbying{{anchor|Tobacco lobby}} ==
Efforts to lobby against environmental regulation have included campaigns to manufacture doubt about the science behind climate change, and to obscure the scientific consensus and data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|Dunlap|Freeman|2008|p=352}}: "While these CTTs sometimes joined corporate America in directly lobbying against environmental policies, their primary tactic in combating environmentalism has been to challenge the need for protective environmental policy by questioning the seriousness of environmental problems and the validity of environmental science."&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts have undermined public confidence in climate science, and impacted climate change lobbying.&lt;ref name="freeman351"&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|Dunlap|Freeman|2008|p=351}}: "Conservative think tanks…and their backers launched a full-scale counter-movement… We suggest that this counter-movement has been central to the reversal of US support for environmental protection, both domestically and internationally. Its major tactic has been disputing the seriousness of environmental problems and undermining environmental science by promoting what we term 'environmental scepticism.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="disinformation"&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlap|2013}}: "From the outset, there has been an organized "disinformation" campaign… to "manufacture uncertainty" over AGW, especially by attacking climate science and scientists. This appears an effective strategy given that confidence in climate science and trust in climate scientists are key factors influencing the public's views of AGW."&lt;/ref&gt;

The political advocacy organizations [[FreedomWorks]] and [[Americans for Prosperity]], funded by [[Political activities of the Koch brothers|brothers David and Charles Koch]] of [[Koch Industries]], were important in supporting the [[Tea Party movement]] and in encouraging the movement to focus on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dryzek |first1=John S. |authorlink1=John Dryzek |first2=Richard B. |last2=Norgaard |authorlink2=Richard Norgaard |first3=David |last3=Schlosberg |title=The Oxford Handbook of Climate Change and Society |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-968342-0 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other conservative organizations such as the [[Heritage Foundation]], Marshall Institute, [[Cato Institute]] and the [[American Enterprise Institute]] were significant participants in these lobbying attempts, seeking to halt or eliminate environmental regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=

This approach to downplay the significance of climate change was copied from [[tobacco lobbyists]]; in the face of scientific evidence linking tobacco to [[lung cancer]], to prevent or delay the introduction of regulation. Lobbyists attempted to [[Discrediting tactic|discredit]] the scientific research by creating doubt and manipulating debate. They worked to discredit the scientists involved, to dispute their findings, and to create and maintain an apparent controversy by promoting claims that contradicted scientific research.

Former [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] president [[Frederick Seitz]], who, according to an article by Mark Hertsgaard in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', earned about [[US$]]585,000 in the 1970s and 1980s as a consultant to [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]],&lt;ref name="HertsgaardSlept"&gt;{{cite news | title=While Washington Slept | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/05/warming200605 | first=Mark | last=Hertsgaard | publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=May 2006 | accessdate=2 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; went on to chair groups such as the [[Science and Environmental Policy Project]] and the George C. Marshall Institute alleged to have made efforts to "downplay" global warming. Seitz stated in the 1980s that "Global warming is far more a matter of politics than of climate." Seitz authored the [[Oregon Petition]], a document published jointly by the Marshall Institute and [[Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine]] in opposition to the [[Kyoto protocol]]. The petition and accompanying "Research Review of Global Warming Evidence" claimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind. There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. … We are living in an increasingly lush environment of plants and animals as a result of the carbon dioxide increase. Our children will enjoy an Earth with far more plant and animal life than that with which we now are blessed. This is a wonderful and unexpected gift from the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="denial_ind_guardian" /&gt;

George Monbiot wrote in ''The Guardian'' that this petition, which he criticizes as misleading and tied to industry funding, "has been cited by almost every journalist who claims that climate change is a myth." Efforts by climate change denial groups played a significant role in the eventual rejection of the Kyoto protocol in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "The work by McCright and Dunlap has highlighted the effectiveness of organized climate sceptic groups in influencing US policy making in the 1990s and early 2000s, including their central role in the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by the US Congress"&lt;/ref&gt;

Monbiot has written about another group founded by the tobacco lobby, [[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]] (TASSC), that now campaigns against measures to combat global warming. In again trying to [[Astroturfing|manufacture the appearance of a grass-roots movement]] against "unfounded fear" and "over-regulation," Monbiot states that TASSC "has done more damage to the campaign to halt [climate change] than any other body."&lt;ref name="denial_ind_guardian" /&gt;

[[Manufactured controversy|Manufactured uncertainty]] over climate change, the fundamental strategy of climate change denial, has been very effective, particularly in the US. It has contributed to low levels of public concern and to government inaction worldwide.&lt;ref name="public-success" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lever-Tracy|2010|p=255}}: "In sum, we see that manufacturing uncertainty over climate change is the fundamental strategy of the denial machine […] As we reflect on the evolution of climate science and policy-making over the past few decades, we believe the denial machine has achieved considerable success – especially in the US but internationally as well. Public concern over global warming and support for climate policy-making in the US is low relative to other nations (see Chapter 10, this volume), contributing to inaction by the US government.&lt;/ref&gt; An Angus Reid poll released in 2010 indicates that global warming skepticism in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom has been rising.&lt;ref name="CorcoranCoolDown"&gt;{{cite news |last=Corcoran |first=Terence |date=6 January 2010 |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story.html |title=The cool down in climate polls |website=[[Financial Post]] |quote=Angus Reid surveyed people…before and after [the] [[COP15|Copenhagen [summit]]]. The drop off in public support for the idea that global warming is a fact mostly caused by human activity looks most pronounced in Canada. In November, 63% of Canadians supported global warming as a man-made phenomenon. By Dec. 23, that support had fallen 52%… A similar trend has been noted in the United States, where confidence in global warming theory has dropped to 46%… down from 51% in July last year. In Britain, only 43% believe man-made global warming is a fact, down from… 55% in July.

Another cause may be weariness from overexposure to the topic: secondary polls suggest that the public may have been discouraged by extremism when discussing the topic,&lt;ref name="CorcoranCoolDown" /&gt; while other polls show 54% of U.S. voters believe that "the news media make global warming appear worse than it really is."&lt;ref name="RasmussenMediaHype"&gt;Rasmussen Reports. (6 February 2009). [http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/environment_energy/54_say_media_hype_global_warming_dangers 54% Say Media Hype Global Warming Dangers].&lt;/ref&gt; A poll in 2009 regarding the issue of whether "some scientists have falsified research data to support their own theories and beliefs about global warming" showed that 59% of Americans believed it "at least somewhat likely", with 35% believing it was "very likely".&lt;ref name="RasmussenPoll" /&gt;

According to [[Tim Wirth]], "They patterned what they did after the tobacco industry. […] Both figured, sow enough doubt, call the science uncertain and in dispute. That's had a huge impact on both the public and Congress."&lt;ref name="tobacco-approach" /&gt; This approach has been propagated by the US media, presenting a false balance between climate science and climate skeptics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antilla|2005}}: "the popular press uses a number of methods to frame climate science as uncertain, including 'through the practice of interjecting and emphasizing controversy or disagreement among scientists'… In order to provide balance while reporting on climate change, some journalists include rebuttals by ''experts'' who, often through think-tanks, are affiliated with the fossil fuel industry. Regrettably, this creates the impression that scientific opinion is evenly divided or completely unsettled"&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' reports that the majority of Europe and Japan accept the consensus on scientific climate change, but only one third of Americans considered human activity to play a major role in climate change in 2006; 64% believed that scientists disagreed about it "a lot."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Begley|2007}}: "polls found that 64 percent of Americans thought there was 'a lot' of scientific disagreement on climate change; only one third thought planetary warming was "mainly caused by things people do." In contrast, majorities in Europe and Japan recognize a broad consensus among climate experts"&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 ''Newsweek'' poll found these numbers were declining, although majorities of Americans still believed that scientists were uncertain about climate change and its causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Begley|2007}}: "A new NEWSWEEK Poll finds that the influence of the denial machine remains strong. Although the figure is less than in earlier polls, 39 percent of those asked say there is "a lot of disagreement among climate scientists" on the basic question of whether the planet is warming; 42 percent say there is a lot of disagreement that human activities are a major cause of global warming. Only 46 percent say the greenhouse effect is being felt today."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.|Rush Holt]] wrote a piece for ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', which appeared in ''Newsweek'':

{{quote|… for more than two decades scientists have been issuing warnings that the release of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}), is probably altering Earth's climate in ways that will be expensive and even deadly. The American public yawned and bought bigger cars. Statements by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], [[American Geophysical Union]], [[American Meteorological Society]], [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], and others underscored the warnings and called for new government policies to deal with climate change. Politicians, presented with noisy statistics, shrugged, said there is too much doubt among scientists, and did nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holt, Rush |title=Trying to Get Us to Change Course" (film review.) |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5835 |pages=198–9 |date=13 July 2007 |doi=10.1126/science.1142810 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/317/5835/198}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Deliberate attempts by the [[Western Fuels Association]] "to confuse the public" have succeeded in their objectives. This has been "exacerbated by media treatment of the climate issue". According to a Pew poll in 2012, 57% of the US public are unaware of, or outright reject, the scientific consensus on climate change.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cook, John |title=Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages= 024024|date=15 May 2013 |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 |display-authors=etal |quote=there is a significant gap between public perception and reality, with 57% of the US public either disagreeing or unaware that scientists overwhelmingly agree that the earth is warming due to human activity (Pew 2012). Contributing to this "consensus gap" are campaigns designed to confuse the public about the level of agreement among climate scientists....The narrative presented by some dissenters is that the scientific consensus is "… on the point of collapse" while "… the number of scientific 'heretics' is growing with each passing year" A systematic, comprehensive review of the literature provides quantitative evidence countering this assertion. The number of papers rejecting AGW is a minuscule proportion of the published research, with the percentage slightly decreasing over time. Among papers expressing a position on AGW, an overwhelming percentage (97.2% based on self-ratings, 97.1% based on abstract ratings) endorses the scientific consensus on AGW.|bibcode = 2013ERL.....8b4024C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations promoting climate change denial have asserted that scientists are increasingly rejecting climate change, but this notion is contradicted by [[Surveys of scientists' views on climate change#John Cook et al., 2013|research showing that 97%]] of published papers endorse the scientific consensus, and that percentage is increasing with time.&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt;

Social psychologist Craig Foster compares climate change denialists to flat-earth believers and the reaction to the latter by the scientific community. Foster states, "the potential and kinetic energy devoted to counter the flat-earth movement is wasteful and misguided... I don't understand why anybody would worry about the flat-earth gnat while facing the climate change mammoth... Climate change denial does not require belief. It only requires neglect."&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Craig|title=Flat-Earth Anxieties Reflect Misplaced Priorities|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|year=2018|volume=42|issue=3|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Aaron McCright argued that [[anti-environmentalism]]—and climate change denial specifically—has expanded to a point in the US where it has now become "a central tenet of the current [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/jan/07/era-of-climate-science-denial-is-not-over-study-finds |title=Era of climate science denial is not over, study finds |author=Graham Redfearn |date=7 January 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, global oil companies have begun to acknowledge the existence of climate change and its risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil Company Positions on the Reality and Risk of Climate Change|url=http://www.uwosh.edu/es/climate-change/oil-company-positions-on-the-reality-and-risk-of-climate-change|website=Environmental Studies|publisher=University of Oshkosh—Wisconsin|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufactured climate change denial is also influencing how scientific knowledge is communicated to the public.  According to climate scientist [[Michael E. Mann]], "...universities and scientific societies and organizations, publishers, etc.—are too often risk averse when it comes to defending and communicating science that is perceived as threatening by powerful interests..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_interview_with_csicon_speaker_michael_mann|title=An Interview with CSICon Speaker Michael Mann |author=Mark Boslough |author-link=Mark Boslough|date=20 October 2017 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Dalpat Vilas''''' is the surviving fragment of a historical manuscript. Written in the [[Rajasthani language]], it is the earliest known [[Rajput]] source of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]-Rajput relations. The initial portion of the manuscript covers the genealogy of the [[Rathore]]s (of [[Marwar]]) and the Sur dynasty. The bulk of the manuscript chronicles events in Marwar and adjoining areas during the reign of [[Akbar]].

==The author==
The author of the ''Dalpat Vilas'' remains unknown. It can be inferred that he was probably a Vaishnav [[Brahman]] as in the manuscript Keshvaraya ([[Vishnu]]) is said to have protected princes Dalpat and Bhopat.

==Prince Dalpat==
The eponymous Prince Dalpat was a Rajput of the Rathore clan and a scion of [[Rao Bika|Bika]] (the founder of [[Bikaner]]). In the manuscript, Bika is referred to as ''[[Vikramaditya]]''. Dalpat's father was Maharaja Rai Singh of Bikaner. Rai Singh was in turn, the grandson of Jaitsingh (a grandson of Bika).

==Period of authorship==
The ''Dalpat Vilas'' was probably written during  Maharaja Rai Singh's rule in the period 1579–1612 C.E.

==Events chronicled in the ''Dalpat Vilas''==

===Jaitsingh’s death===
Jaitsingh was killed in a battle with Maldev of [[Jodhpur]]. Jaitsingh's son, Kalyanmal was in the wilderness until he received the assistance of [[Sher Shah Suri]]. Jaitsi's father, Rav Lunkaran had previously given shelter to Sher Shah. Sher Shah gave Bayana, Hissar, [[Rewari]] and Mewat to Kalyanmal and later defeated Maldev. Kalyanmal was thus finally able to rule from Bikaner.

===The Sur Dynasty===
Writing of the Sur dynasty, the manuscript states that Sher Shah died of injuries suffered during the siege of [[Kalinjar]]. Sher Shah's son, Salem (Islam) Khan was succeeded by Firoz Shah. The young boy was killed by Sher Shah's nephew Mamrez (Mubariz) Khan. Mamrez Khan reportedly went insane after the crime and his  ''vakil'' (minister)  [[Hemu]] seized power.

===Second battle of Panipat===
The death of [[Humayun]], Akbar's coronation at [[Kalanaur, Punjab|Kalanaur]], Hemu's capture of Delhi and Hemu's defeat at Panipat are briefly mentioned. Hemu (also called Vasant Raya) is said to have been killed, not by Akbar but by his nobles [[Bairam Khan]] and Bali Beg.  Kalyanmal of Bikaner is said to have agreed to receive Bairam Khan (after he rebelled against Akbar) while Rana Udaysimha (of [[Mewar]]) and Maldev of Jodhpur refused to do so.

===Marriage of Rai Singh===
The next event mentioned is the marriage of Prince Rai Singh to Jaswant-de, the daughter of Rana Udaysimha. Prince Bhopat and Prince Dalpat were the two sons from this marriage.

===Akbar’s visit to Nagaur===
Described next is a ceremony at Nagaur in 1570 C.E., where Akbar married two princesses from Bikaner, Bhanumati (daughter of Bhimraj) and Raj Kanwari (daughter of Kanhaji). Kalyanmal was sent for by Akbar, and left his son, Rai Singh with the emperor. Akbar also received Maldev's son Chandrasen. Rawal Hariraj of [[Jaisalmer]] is said to have sent his daughter (with Bhagwant Das Kachhwaha) to Akbar. Udaya Singh, ruler of [[Sirohi]], came to promote his claim (as older brother of Chandrasen) to be ruler of Marwar. Udaya Singh's visit is not mentioned by the Dalpat Vilas.  Kalyanmal later received Jodhpur as a  ''jagir'' from Akbar, he entrusted the fort to Rai Singh. In the interim, Udaya Singh had died and the new ruler, Rav Man had killed Udaya Singh's wife Pushpavati ( the sister of Rai Singh). In 1572, Rai Singh retaliated by attacking and sacking Sirohi.

===Akbar’s Gujarat campaigns===
Akbar led an expedition to [[Gujarat]] where Tamat Khan reportedly gave Akbar the keys to Gujarat (in reality just [[Ahmedabad]]). Akbar then conquered Surat and defeated Ibrahim Husain Mirza near Kathoti. Akbar then returned to Fatehpur Sikri with Rai Singh joining him en route in Ajmer. After a year, Rai Singh set out to crush Muhammad Shahs’ rebellion in Gujarat; Akbar joined the campaign in [[Jalor]]. For his services, Akbar rewarded Rai Singh with Nagaur, Sirsa and Marot. Prince Dalpat was put in charge of Sirsa.

===Kalyanmal’s death===
Around this time Kalyanmal, Bharmal and Narayan (a son of Bhimraj) died. Rai Singh then became ruler of Bikaner and Bhagwantdas the ruler of Amber. Seizing the opportunity, Dalpat took Hardesar and expelled Bhimraj's family.

===Siege of Siwana===
Rai Singh (along with Shah Quli Khan and others) was assigned the task of capturing Siwana. The fort was being defended by Pata, brother-in-law of Rai Singh's minister, [[Karam Chand Bachhawat]]. He allowed supplies into the fort and sabotaged the siege. Meanwhile, Rai Singh's brother, Ram Singh defeated Chandrasen of Jodhpur at the battle of Kulanja valley. Akbar sent Shahbaz Khan to Siwana and instructed Rai Singh to return to the court. Shahbaz Khan cut off the supplies and captured the fort.

===Karam Chand’s maneuverings===
The ''Dalpat Vilas'' then delves into the ongoing intrigues in Bikaner. Friction is said to be present between Mantri [[Karam Chand Bachhawat|Karam Chand]] and Rai Singh's mother with the minister keeping Rai Singh away from his mother. [[Karam Chand Bachhawat|Karam Chand]] also sowed seeds of discord between Rai Singh and Prince Bhopat. After the Maharani herself brought Bhopat from Nagaur, the angry Rai Singh divested Bhopat of most of his retinue. Bhopat was sent to Bikaner in 1575 C.E. but after a good start he took to a life of profligate spending and drinking. When Rai Singh was visiting Bhadana, the Maharani brought the drunken Bhopat before his father. The enraged Rai Singh apparently appointed Ram Singh as Bhopat's guardian and sent them to Bikaner; Rai Singh proceeded to meet Akbar. Mahesh, Gogade and Jivraj (Bhopat's nobles) were assigned to accompany Dalpat instead.

[[Karam Chand Bachhawat|Karam Chand]] continued his efforts to bring harm to Bhopat. The prince had a poor appetite and [[Karam Chand Bachhawat|Karam Chand]] appointed a physician to cure the problem by branding. In 1576, a hot iron was stated to have been applied to Bhopat's stomach. A similar branding was planned for the prince's back but was prevented by the prince's attendants. Despite all these machinations, Bhopat regained his health.

===Rai Singh’s move to Merta===
In 1578 C.E., Rai Singh requested Akbar that to be allowed to swap Merta for Jodhpur. Akbar assented and went to [[Malwa]] with Prince Bhopat. Prince Dalpat joined the Maharaja as he proceeded to Merta. On the way, Rai Singh stopped at Kantalya and raided Bansor. Dalpat Singh was then sent to Bikaner while Rai Singh sacked Chotila and Rohis. Dalpat went to Badhnau to have a feast at Ram Singh's house. The Prince then stayed at Kalyanpur for five days and joined Surtan, Prithiraj (brothers of Rai Singh) and assembled  ''thakurs'' in a game of ''Chaugan''. Dalpat then returned to Badhnau.

===Keshav’s intemperate behavior===
The manuscript states that in this interim, the Jats of Nawa killed Mahesh. Many jats were then killed in revenge by Keshav, one of Ram Singh's Rajputs (nobles). Informed of this, Prince Dalpat rushed to intercept Keshav and reached Bigga.  Keshav, however, had already returned to Kalyanpur and Dalpat returned to Bikaner. When Ram Singh and his brothers went to Sirohi, Keshav was asked to stay behind. Keshav, however, refused to obey and was allowed to join the party. Upon reaching [[Pali, Rajasthan|Pali]], Ram Singh wished for Keshav to proceed to [[Kumbhalgarh|Kumbhalmer]] and be assigned to Bhanji. Keshav again flouted the command and Ram Singh did not force the issue.

===Friction between Ram Singh and Rai Singh===
At Sirohi, Surtan (a ''thakur'' from Sirohi) had come to visit Maharaja Rai Singh. Surtan and Prince Bhopat were sent  by Rai Singh to Akbar. Ram Singh and Prithiraj attended a feast hosted by Bija Deora.  Ram Singh's partaking of  a feast with Pushpavati's  killers angered Rai Singh. He communicated his displeasure to Ram Singh and said that it would be difficult for him to live with his brother. In order to fulfill Rai Singh's wish, Ram Singh left Sirohi.  After going only part of the way home, Ram Singh sent a message asking for forgiveness. Rai Singh relented and Ram Singh returned to Sirohi.

===Keshav’s continued impertinence===
Maharaja Rai Singh took his  ''savars'' (horsemen) for inspection by Akbar's ''Bakshi''. At the inspection. Ram Singh's horsemen followed the protocol by dismounting, leading the horses by the reins, saluting and circling back. Keshav, however, did not dismount and merely galloped away. Rai Singh gave orders for Keshav to be killed but he escaped by staying close to Ram Singh. This led to Ram Singh also becoming the target of Rai Singh's wrath. At this point, the Maharani, not wishing to see fratricide, sent Ram Singh away.

===Trouble with Amra===
Amra (a brother of Rai Singh) had been stealing camels belonging to the Emperor. Dalpat was sent by Rai Singh to have the camels freed and Amra expelled. Dalpat did not find Amra at Sidhu and went to Badhsar and rounded up some of Raghodas’ men (Raghodas was a son of Kalyanmal). The men were released after some mild punishment. Rai Singh again sent word to Dalpat that the Amra matter had to be dealt with. Dalpat went to sack Amra's village and gave the residents opportunity to leave. After the offer was refused, a short skirmish followed and Dalpat's victorious force set fire to the village. Ram Singh and Amra were meanwhile headed from Bikaner after leaving Rai Singh. The news of Amra's village being attacked reached the duo, Amra wished to return to his village. Ram Singh, however, sent a communication to Prince Dalpat and headed to Nohar with the pack animals.

===Amba’s death and its repercussions===
Ram Singh became disillusioned with the world after his wife Amba (daughter of Rana Uday Singh) died. Ram Singh had asked Surtan and Prithiraj to cease their depredations in Bikaner. Surtan and Prithiraj, however, continued to seize animals from villagers. Ram Singh decided to end his life like a true Rajput by dying in battle. Dalpat's advisers also wished to get rid of Ram Singh. After inciting Dalpat through invectives, Ram Singh reached Rajadwala. Dalpat's forces attacked and the valorous Ram Singh was killed. Prithiraj and Surtan were allowed by Dalpat to take their possessions to [[Nohar]]. After a few days, Prithiraj, Surtan and Amra resumed atrocities in the Bhatner area. Dalpat sent a force against them, but Prithiraj and Surtan went to plead their case before the Emperor. Akbar summoned Dalpat and the prince went to the Imperial court.  After returning to Bikaner, the young prince married the daughters of Rupsi and Chauhan Ramdas. Dalpat then joined Akbar's retinue near Rewari. Akbar proceeded to visit several towns, Prince Bhopat was left at Tehad after he developed smallpox. News of Prince Bhopat's death arrived as Akbar reached Shekana-pattan.

===The Qamargah hunt===
Akbar next traveled via Chandnot ([[Chiniot]]) and Hazara to Bhere ([[Bhera]]), there animals for the hunt had been collected near Girjhak (present day [[Jalalpur Sharif|Jalalpur]]). While Akbar went deer hunting, the nobles played a game of '' [[kabaddi]]'' dressed in their ''kachhas'' (underwear).  Upon returning from the hunt, the Emperor did not join the game but went to the tent of Shekh Jamal.  All the nobles dressed and went to pay their respects to Akbar. After some time, Akbar went to bathe in the river (the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]]). Akbar's son, Salim was hesitant to enter the river. Akbar, therefore, dunked Salim in the river a few times. The Rajput noble, Danji received four to five lashes from Akbar's whip as he was late. Pritihidip and his advisers also felt the sting of Akbar's whip. Randhirot (Prithidip's uncle) was also whipped as it was found that he had detained Prithidip. Upon being whipped, Randhirot stabbed himself in the belly. Akbar was further enraged and ordered Randhirot to be trampled to death by an elephant. This order could not be carried out as the elephant did not move to trample Randhirot.

At this juncture, the irritated Akbar went to enjoy the company of his ladies. The nobles also returned to their respective tents. [[Man Singh I of Amber|Man Singh]] arrived at the  camp in the afternoon and went to pay his respects to Akbar. Akbar told Man Singh to have Randhirot looked after, however, the Rajput was already dead.

Dalpat, Man Singh and Madhav Singh went to see the Emperor and found him to be in a foul mood. Akbar reportedly started shouting and said that Hindus should eat cows and Muslims should eat pigs. He also took off his turban and asked for a barber to shave his head. The panic stricken barber ran away and Akbar started to trim his own hair with a dagger. Shah Fatahulla intervened and took the dagger from Akbar's hand. All the assembled Muslim and Rajput nobles were then ordered to take off their turbans. The Emperor then had his hair cropped and started shouting again. He praised the Rathores and Rajawats but called the Shekhawats mere [[Jats]]. With difficulty, Shah Fatahulla took Akbar to the sleeping quarters.

In the morning, the Rajput nobles prayed to their deities and waited. Akbar had his beard shaved and saying that he would invade ''Firang'' he permitted the nobles to leave their beards intact. Akbar then took off his turban and tore it into strips. Each Hindu chieftain was given a strip from the turban and had ''Gangajal'' (water from the holy [[Ganges River|Ganges]]) placed on his palm. Prince Dalpat also received a strip of Akbar's turban.

The animals were then released and Akbar rested for five days. On the sixth day, Akbar had his beard shaved and all the nobles also had their beards shaved. The Emperor then proceeded towards [[Fatehpur Sikri]]. En route, the party camped near Ramgarh after crossing the Chahnal river. Raja Bhagwantdas came to meet Akbar at the encampment. Akbar rebuked Bhagwantdas and Man Singh for abandoning the siege of [[Kumbhalgarh|Kumbhalmer]]. Rumors flew in the camp that they had sustained heavy losses and were short of supplies. In truth ( per the ''[[Akbarnama]]'') Shahbaz Khan sent them back as he suspected that the two would be less than industrious in their efforts against the Rana ([[Rana Pratap]]). At the camp, Prince Dalpat noticed a Rajput holding a dagger and moving towards Kunwar Man Singh. Dalpat raised an alarm, and the person was intercepted by Rav Durga.

The fragmentary manuscript ends at this point, the contents of the missing portion are unknown.

==Corroboration of events in the ''Dalpat Vilas''==
The genealogy of the Rathores and the Sur dynasty as described in the ''Dalpat Vilas'', are in keeping with other historical sources. The story of Sher Shah Suri repaying a debt of gratitude is uncorroborated. The manuscript ascribes Hemu's killing to Akbar's nobles, this is consistent with the version in the writings of [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]], Badaoni and others. Akbar's visit to Nagaur is also mentioned in the ''Akbarnama'' while the siege of Siwana is also spoken of by Abul Fazl.

Akbar's unusual behavior at the Qamargah hunt of 1579 is mentioned in the  ''Akbarnama'' and by Badaoni. The rather detailed description of the happenings ( in the ''Dalpat Vilas'' ) suggest that the author was actually present at the scene.

==Author's bias in the ''Dalpat Vilas''==
The ''Dalpat Vilas'' blames [[Karam Chand Bachhawat]] Mehta for Maharaja Rai Singh's failure to capture Siwana, the death of Ram Singh and other problems of the state. In regard to siege of Siwana, Rai Singh was a good commander in open field warfare but less experienced in conducting a siege. Informed of this, Akbar sent Shahbaz Khan to conduct the siege. [[Karam Chand Bachhawat]] Mehta was a capable minister and found employment with the Emperor after leaving Bikaner.

[[File:Galileos Dialogue Title Page.png|thumb|300px|right|Frontispiece and title page of the ''Dialogue'', 1632]]
The '''''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems''''' (''Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo'') is a 1632 [[Italian-language]] book by [[Galileo Galilei]] comparing the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] system with the traditional [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] system. It was translated into Latin as ''Systema cosmicum''&lt;ref&gt;Maurice A. Finocchiaro: [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVMy7yoGbdIC&amp;pg=PA61 ''Retrying Galileo, 1633-1992''], University of California Press, 2007 {{ISBN|0-520-25387-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25387-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-en|Cosmic System}}) in 1635 by [[Matthias Bernegger]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSe6AAAAIAAJ Journal for the history of astronomy, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was dedicated to Galileo's patron, [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], who received the first printed copy on February 22, 1632.&lt;ref name="Gindikin1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gindikin|first=Semen Grigorʹevich|title=Tales of physicists and mathematicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vhx--jfFN8IC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=22 February 2011|year=1988|publisher=[[Birkhäuser]]|isbn=978-0-8176-3317-2|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]], the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, while in the [[Ptolemaic system]], everything in the Universe circles around the Earth. The ''Dialogue'' was published in [[Florence]] under a formal license from the [[Inquisition]]. In 1633, Galileo was found to be "vehemently suspect of [[heresy]]" based on the book, which was then placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]]'', from which it was not removed until 1835 (after the theories it discussed had been permitted in print in 1822).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/galileochronology.html The Trial of Galileo: A Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205213233/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/galileochronology.html |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an action that was not announced at the time, the publication of anything else he had written or ever might write was also banned in Catholic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}See [[Galileo affair#note-publication-ban|Galileo affair]] for more details, including sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
While writing the book, Galileo referred to it as his ''Dialogue on the Tides'', and  when the manuscript went to the Inquisition for approval, the title was ''Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea''. He was ordered to remove all mention of tides from the title and to change the preface because granting approval to such a title would look like approval of his theory of the [[tide]]s using the motion of the Earth as proof. As a result, the formal title on the title page is ''Dialogue'', which is followed by Galileo's name, academic posts, and followed by a long subtitle. The name by which the work is now known was extracted by the printer from the description on the title page when permission was given to reprint it with an approved preface by a Catholic theologian in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Galileo: Pioneer Scientist|first=Stillman|last=Drake|year=1990|page=187|publisher=U of Toronto Press |isbn=0-8020-2725-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This must be kept in mind when discussing Galileo's motives for writing the book. Although the book is presented formally as a consideration of both systems (as it needed to be in order to be published at all), there is no question that the Copernican side gets the better of the argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sleepwalkers|first=Arthur|last=Koestler|page=480|publisher=Penguin Arkana|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
The book is presented as a series of discussions, over a span of four days, among two philosophers and a layman:

* Salviati argues for the Copernican position and presents some of Galileo's views directly, calling him the "Academician" in honor of Galileo's membership in the [[Accademia dei Lincei]]. He is named after Galileo's friend [[Filippo Salviati]] (1582–1614).
* Sagredo is an intelligent layman who is initially neutral. He is named after Galileo's friend [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo]] (1571–1620).
* Simplicio, a dedicated follower of [[Ptolemy]] and [[Aristotle]], presents the traditional views and the arguments against the Copernican position.  He is supposedly named after [[Simplicius of Cilicia]], a sixth-century commentator on Aristotle, but it was suspected the name was a double entendre, as the Italian for "simple" (as in "simple minded") is "semplice".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Koestler, ''The Sleepwalkers: A History of Man's Changing Vision of the Universe'' (1959), Penguin Books, 1986 edition: {{ISBN|0-14-055212-X}}, 978014055212X 1990 reprint: {{ISBN|0-14-019246-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-14-019246-9}} [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0140192468]&lt;/ref&gt;  Simplicio is modeled on two contemporary conservative philosophers, [[Lodovico delle Colombe]] (1565–1616?), Galileo's opponent, and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]] (1550–1631), a Paduan colleague who had refused to look through the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman Drake: ''Galileo at Work: His Scientific Biography'', Courier Dover Publications, 2003, {{ISBN|0-486-49542-6}}, page 355 : Cremonini and delle Colombe&lt;/ref&gt; Colombe was the leader of a group of Florentine opponents of Galileo's, which some of the latter's friends referred to as "the pigeon league".&lt;ref&gt;"La legha del pippione". "Pippione" is a pun on Colombe's surname—which is the plural of the Italian word for dove. Galileo's friends, the painter, [[:it:Cigoli|Lodovico Cardi da Cigoli]] {{it icon}}, his former student, [[Benedetto Castelli]], and a couple of his other correspondents often referred to Colombe as "il Colombo", which means "the Pigeon".  Galileo himself used this term a couple of times in a letter to Cigoli of October, 1611 [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-214 (Edizione Nazionale 11:214)]. The more derisive nickname, "il Pippione", sometimes used by Cigoli [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-176 (Edizione Nazionale 11:176,] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-229 11:229,] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-476 11:476,][http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-502 11:502)], is a now archaic Italian word with a triple entendre.   Besides meaning "young pigeon", it is also a jocular term for a testicle, and a Tuscan dialect word for a fool.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
The discussion is not narrowly limited to astronomical topics, but ranges over much of contemporary science. Some of this is to show what Galileo considered good science, such as the discussion of [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]'s work on magnetism.  Other parts are important to the debate, answering erroneous arguments against the Earth's motion.

A classic argument against earth motion is the lack of speed sensations of the earth surface, though it moves, by the earth's rotation, at about 1700&amp;nbsp;km/h at the equator. In this category there is a [[thought experiment]] in which a man is below decks on a [[Galileo's ship|ship]] and cannot tell whether the ship is docked or is moving smoothly through the water: he observes water dripping from a bottle, fish swimming in a tank, butterflies flying, and so on; and their behavior is just the same whether the ship is moving or not.   This is a classic exposition of the [[Inertial frame of reference]] and refutes the objection that if we were moving hundreds of kilometres an hour as the Earth rotated, anything that one dropped would rapidly fall behind and drift to the west.

The bulk of Galileo's arguments may be divided into three classes:

* Rebuttals to the objections raised by traditional philosophers; for example, the thought experiment on the ship.
* Observations that are incompatible with the Ptolemaic model: the [[phases of Venus]], for instance, which simply couldn't happen, or the apparent motions of [[sunspot]]s, which could only be explained in the Ptolemaic or Tychonic systems as resulting from an implausibly complicated precession of the Sun's axis of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, [[#Reference-Drake-1970|(1970]], pp.191–196), Linton [[#Reference-Linton-2004|(2004]], pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B4br4XJFj0MC&amp;pg=PA211 211–12)], Sharratt [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|(1994]], p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-TgYAq3P0P8C&amp;pg=PA166 166)].  This is not true, however, for geocentric systems—such as that proposed by [[Longomontanus]]—in which the Earth rotated.  In such systems the apparent motion of sunspots could be accounted for just as easily as in Copernicus's.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arguments showing that the elegant unified theory of the Heavens that the philosophers held, which was believed to prove that the Earth was stationary, was incorrect; for instance, the mountains of the [[Moon]], the moons of [[Jupiter]], and the very existence of sunspots, none of which was part of the old astronomy.

Generally, these arguments have held up well in terms of the knowledge of the next four centuries.  Just how convincing they ought to have been to an impartial reader in 1632 remains a contentious issue.

Galileo attempted a fourth class of argument:

* Direct physical argument for the Earth's motion, by means of an explanation of tides.

As an account of the causation of tides or a proof of the Earth's motion, it is a failure. The fundamental argument is internally inconsistent and actually leads to the conclusion that tides do not exist. But, Galileo was fond of the argument and devoted the "Fourth Day" of the discussion to it. The degree of its failure is—like nearly anything having to do with Galileo—a matter of controversy.  On the one hand, the whole thing has recently been described in print as "cockamamie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Science, Religion, and the Galileo Affair |author=Timothy Moy |date=September 2001 |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |url=http://csicop.org/si/2001-09// |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=43–49 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129142753/http://csicop.org/si/2001-09// |archivedate=January 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] used a rather different description:

[[File:Dialogo Galileo SWRI.jpg|thumb|250px|A copy of the ''Dialogo'', Florence edition, located at the [[Tom Slick]] rare book collection at [[Southwest Research Institute]], in [[Texas]].]]
The ''Dialogue'' does not treat the [[Tychonic system]], which was becoming the preferred system of many astronomers at the time of publication and which was ultimately proven incorrect.  The Tychonic system is a motionless Earth system but not a Ptolemaic system;  it is a hybrid system of the Copernican and Ptolemaic models.  Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun (as in the Copernican system) in small circles, while the sun in turn orbits a stationary Earth;  Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn orbit the Sun in much larger circles, which means they also orbit the earth.  The Tychonian system is mathematically equivalent to the Copernican system, except that the Copernican system predicts a [[Stelaar parralax|stellar parallax]], while the Tychonian system predicts no stellar parallax.  Stellar parallax was not measurable until the 19th century, and therefore there was at the time no valid disproof of the Tychonic system on empirical grounds, nor any decisive observational evidence for the Copernican system.

Galileo never took Tycho's system seriously, as can be seen in his correspondence, regarding it as an inadequate and physically unsatisfactory compromise.  A reason for the absence of Tycho's system (in spite of many references to Tycho and his work in the book) may be sought in Galileo's theory of the tides, which provided the original title and organizing principle of the ''Dialogue''.  For, while the Copernican and Tychonic systems are equivalent geometrically, they are quite different dynamically. Galileo's tidal theory entailed the actual, physical movement of the Earth; that is, if true, it would have provided the kind of proof that [[Foucault pendulum|Foucault's pendulum]] apparently provided two centuries later.  With reference to Galileo's tidal theory, there would be no difference between the Ptolemaic and Tychonic systems.

Galileo also fails to discuss the possibility of non-circular orbits, although [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] proposal of an elliptical orbit for Mars had been published in 1609. Prince Cesi's letter to Galileo of 1612 treated the two laws of 1609 as common knowledge. Kepler's third law was published in 1619. A heliocentric system with planets in approximately elliptical orbits is deducible from [[Isaac Newton#Mechanics and gravitation|Newton's laws of motion and gravity]], but these were not published until 1687.

==Summary==
'''Preface: To the Discerning Reader'''
refers to the ban on the "Pythagorean opinion that the earth moves" and says that the author "takes the Copernican side with a pure mathematical hypothesis". He introduces the friends [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo|Sagredo]] and [[Filippo Salviati|Salviati]] with whom he had had discussions as well as the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosopher [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicio]].

===Day one===

He starts with Aristotle's proof of the completeness and perfection of the world (i.e. the universe) because of its three dimensions. Simplicio points out that three was favoured by the Pythagoreans whereas Salviati can't understand why three legs are better than two or four. He suggests that the numbers were "trifles which later spread among the vulgar" and that their definitions, such as those of straight lines and right angles, were more useful in establishing the dimensions. Simplicio's response was that Aristotle thought that in physical matters mathematical demonstration wasn't always needed. 

Salviati attacks Aristotle's definition of the heavens as incorruptible and unchanging whilst only the lunar-bound zone shows change. He points to the changes seen in the skies: the new stars of [[SN 1572|1572]] and [[Kepler's Supernova|1604]] and [[Sunspot#17th and 18th centuries|sunspots]], seen through the new [[telescope]]. There is a discussion about Aristotle's use of ''a priori'' arguments. Salviati suggests that he uses his experience to choose an appropriate argument to prove just as others do and that he would change his mind in the present circumstances.

Simplicio argues that sunspots could simply be small opaque objects passing in front of the sun, but Salviati points out that some appear or disappear randomly and those at the edge are flattened, unlike separate bodies. Therefore, "it is better Aristotelian philosophy to say 'Heaven is alterable because my senses tell me' than 'Heaven is unalterable because Aristotle was so persuaded by reasoning'".

Experiments with a mirror are used to show that the moon's surface must be opaque and not a perfect crystal sphere as Simplicio believes. He  refuses to accept that mountains on the moon cause shadows, or that reflected light from the earth is responsible for the faint outline in a crescent moon.

Sagredo holds that he considers the earth noble because of the changes in it whereas Simplicio says that change in the moon or stars would be useless because they do not benefit man. Salviati points out that days on the moon are a month long and despite the varied terrain that the telescope has disclosed, it wouldn't sustain life. Humans acquire mathematical truths slowly and hesitantly, whereas God knows the full infinity of them intuitively. And when one looks into the marvellous things men have understood and contrived, then clearly the human mind is one of the most excellent of God's works.

===Day two===

Salviati starts by repeating that Aristotle would be changing his opinions if he saw what they were seeing. "It is the followers of Aristotle who have crowned him with authority, not he who has usurped or appropriated it to himself."

There is one supreme motion—that by which the sun, moon, planets and fixed stars appear to be moved from east to west in the space of 24 hours. This may as logically belong to the earth alone as to the rest of the universe. Aristotle and Ptolemy, who understood this, do not argue against any other motion than this diurnal one.

Motion is relative: the position of the sacks of grain on a ship can be identical at the end of the voyage despite the movement of the ship. Why should we believe that nature moves all these extremely large bodies with inconceivable velocities rather than simply moving the moderately sized earth? If the earth is removed from the picture, what happens to all the movement?

The movement of the skies from east to west is the opposite of all the other motions of the heavenly bodies which are from west to east; making the earth rotate brings it into line with all the others. Although Aristotle argues that circular motions are not contraries, they could still lead to collisions.

The great orbits of the planets take longer than the shorter: Saturn and Jupiter take many years, Mars two, whereas the moon takes only a month. Jupiter's moons take even less. This is not changed if the earth rotates every day, but if the earth is stationary then we suddenly find that the sphere of the fixed stars rotates in 24 hours. Given the distances, that would more reasonably be thousands of years.

In addition some of these stars have to travel faster than others: if the Pole Star was precisely at the axis, then it would be entirely stationary whereas those of the equator have unimaginable speed. The solidity of this supposed sphere is incomprehensible. Make the earth the [[primum mobile]] and the need for this extra sphere disappears.

[[File:Dialogue-day2-9.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Actual path of cannonball B is from C to D]]
They consider three main objections to the motion of the earth: that a falling body would be left behind by the earth and thus fall far to the west of its point of release; that a cannonball fired to the west would similarly fly much further than one fired to the east; and that a cannonball fired vertically would also land far to the west. Salviati shows that these do not take account of the [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] of the cannon.

He also points out that attempting to prove that the earth doesn't move by using vertical fall commits the logical fault of [[paralogism]] (assuming what is to be proved), because if the earth is moving then it is only in appearance that it is falling vertically; in fact it is falling at a slant, as happens with a cannonball rising through the cannon (illustrated).

In rebutting a work which claims that a ball falling from the moon would take six days to arrive, the odd-number rule is introduced: a body falling 1 unit in an interval would fall 3 units in the next interval, 5 units in the subsequent one, etc. This gives rise to the rule by which the distance fallen is according to the square of the time. Using this he calculates the time is really little more than 3 hours. He also points out that density of the material doesn't make much difference: a lead ball might only accelerate twice as fast as one of cork.

In fact, a ball falling from such a height wouldn't fall behind but ahead of the vertical because the rotational motion would be in ever-decreasing circles. What makes the earth move is similar to whatever moves Mars or Jupiter and is the same as that which pulls the stone to earth. Calling it [[gravity]] doesn't explain what it is.

===Day three===

Salviati starts by dismissing the arguments of a book against the [[nova]]s he has been reading overnight.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|first=Scipio|last=Chiaramonti|title=De tribus novis stellis|year=1628}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike comets, these were stationary and their lack of parallax easily checked and thus could not have been in the sublunary sphere.

Simplicio now gives the greatest argument against the annual motion of the earth that if it moves then it can no longer be the center of the zodiac, the world. Aristotle gives proofs that the universe is finite bounded and spherical. Salvatius points out that these disappear if he denies him the assumption that it is movable, but allows the assumption initially in order not to multiply disputes.

[[File:Dialogue-day3-1.png|thumb|right|The solar system]]
He points out that if anything is the centre, it must be the sun not the earth, because all the planets are closer or further away from the earth at different times, Venus and Mars up to eight times. He encourages Simplicio to make a plan of the planets, starting with Venus and Mercury which are easily seen to rotate about the sun. Mars must also go about the sun (as well as the earth) since it is never seen [[Crescent|horned]], unlike Venus now seen through the telescope; similarly with Jupiter and Saturn. Earth, which is between Mars with a period of two years and Venus with nine months, has a period of a year which may more elegantly be attributed to motion than a state of rest.

Sagredo brings up two other common objections. If the earth rotated, the mountains would soon be in a position that one would have to descend them rather than ascend.  Secondly, the motion would be so rapid that someone at the bottom of a well would have only a brief instance to glimpse a star as it traversed. Simplicio can see that the first is no different from travelling over the globe, as any who have circumnavigated but though he realises the second is the same as if the heavens were rotating, he still doesn't understand it. Salviati says the first is no different from those who deny the antipodes. For the second, he encourages Simplicio to decide what fraction of the sky can be seen from down the well.

Salviati brings up another problem, which is that Mars and Venus are not as variable as the theory would suggest. He explains that the size of a star to the human eye is affected by the brightness and the sizes are not real. This is resolved by use of the telescope which also shows the crescent shape of Venus. A further objection to the movement of the earth, the unique existence of the moon, has been resolved by the discovery of the [[moons of Jupiter]], which would appear like our moon to any Jovian.

[[File:Dialogue-day3-2.png|thumb|right|How retrogression is explained by Copernicus]]
Copernicus has succeeded in reducing some of the uneven motions of Ptolemy who had to deal with motions that sometimes go fast, sometimes slow, and sometimes backwards, by means of vast [[epicycle]]s. Mars, above the sun's sphere, often falls far below it, then soars above it. These anomalies are cured by the annual movement of the earth. This is explained by a diagram in which the varying motion of Jupiter is shown using the earth's orbit.

Simplicio produces another booklet in which theological arguments are mixed with astronomic, but Salviati refuses to address the issues from Scripture. So he produces the argument that the fixed stars must be at an inconceivable distance with the smallest larger than the whole orbit of the earth. Salviati explains that this all comes from a misrepresentation of what Copernicus said, resulting in a huge over-calculation of the size of a sixth magnitude star. But many other famous astronomers over-estimated the size of stars by ignoring the brightness factor. Not even Tycho, with his accurate instruments, set himself to measure the size of any star except the sun and moon. But Salviati (Galileo) was able to make a reasonable estimate simply by hanging a cord to obscure the star and measuring the distance from eye to cord.

But still many cannot believe that the fixed stars can individually be as big or bigger than the sun. To what end are these? Salviati maintains that "it is brash for our feebleness to attempt to judge the reasons for God's actions, and to call everything in the universe vain and superfluous which does not serve us".

Has Tycho or any of his disciples tried to investigate in any way phenomena that might affirm or deny the movement of the earth? Do any of them know how much [[Variation (astronomy)|variation]] is needed in the fixed stars? Simplicio objects to conceding that the distance of the fixed stars is too great for it to be detectable. Salviati points out how difficult it is even to detect the varying distances of Saturn. Many of the positions of the fixed stars are not known accurately and far better instruments than Tycho's are needed: say using a sight with a fixed position 60 miles away.

Sagredo then asks Salviati to explain how the Copernican system explains the seasons and inequalities of night and day. This he does with the aid of a diagram showing the position of the earth in the four seasons. He points out how much simpler it is than the Ptolemaic system. But Simplicio thinks Aristotle was wise to avoid too much geometry. He prefers Aristotle's axiom to avoid more than one simple motion at a time.

===Day four===

They are in Sagredo's house in [[Venice]], where tides are an important issue, and Salviati wants to show the effect of the earth's movement on the tides. He first points out the three periods of the tides: ''daily (diurnal)'', generally with intervals of 6 hours of rising and six more of falling; ''monthly'', seemingly from the moon, which increases or decreases these tides; and ''annual'', leading to different sizes at the equinoxes.

He considers first the daily motion. Three varieties are observed: in some places the waters rise and fall without any forward motion; in others they move towards the east and back to the west without rising or falling; in still others there is a combination of both—this happens in Venice where the waters rise on entering and fall on leaving. In the [[Straits of Messina]] there are very swift currents between [[Scylla and Charybdis]]. In the open [[Mediterranean]] the alteration of height is small but the currents are noticeable.

Simplicio counters with the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] explanations, which are based on the depths of the sea, and the dominion of the moon over the water, though this doesn't explain the risings when the moon is below the horizon. But he admits it could be a miracle.

When the water in Venice rises, where does it come from? There is little rise in Corfu or Dubrovnik. From the ocean through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]]? It's much too far away and the currents are too slow.

So could the movement of the container cause the disturbance? Consider the  barges that bring water into Venice. When they hit an obstacle, the water rushes forward; when they speed up it will go to the back. For all this disturbance there is no need for new water and the level in the middle stays largely constant though the water there rushes backwards and forwards.

Consider a point on the earth under the joint action of the annual and diurnal movements. At one time these are added together and 12 hours later they act against each other, so there is an alternate speeding up and slowing down. So the ocean basins are affected in the same way as the barge particularly in an east-west direction. Note also that the length of the barge makes a difference to the speed of oscillations, just as the length of a plumb bob changes its speed. The depth of water also makes a difference to the size of vibrations.

The primary effect only explains tides once a day; one must look elsewhere for the six-hour change, to the oscillation periods of the water. In some places, such as the [[Hellespont]] and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] the periods are briefer and variable. But a north-south sea like the [[Red Sea]] has very little tide whereas the Messina Strait carries the pent up effect of two basins.

Simplicio objects that if this accounts for the water, should it not even more be seen in the winds? Salviati suggests that the containing basins are not so effective and the air does not sustain its motion. Nevertheless, these forces are seen by the [[Trade wind|steady winds]] from east to west in the oceans in the [[torrid zone]].

It seems that the moon also is taking part in the production of the daily effects, but that is repugnant to his mind. The motions of the moon have caused great difficulty to astronomers. It's impossible to make a full account of these things given the irregular nature of the sea basins.

'''Eugen Jebeleanu''' ({{IPA-ro|e.uˈd͡ʒen ʒebeˈle̯anu}}; 24 April 1911 &amp;ndash; 21 August 1991), [[Romania]]n poet, was born in [[Câmpina]], where he attended elementary school. After graduating from high school in [[Braşov]] at age 11 in 1922, he published his first poems five years later in the literary review ''Viaţa literară''. His first book of poetry, ''Schituri cu soare'' ("[[Skete]]s with Sun"), appeared in 1929, the year he moved to [[Bucharest]] to study law at the [[University of Bucharest]]. He published another volume of poems, ''Inimi sub săbii'' ("Hearts under Swords") in 1934, but Jebeleanu's principal literary activity in the 1930s was as a journalist closely allied with the left-wing press.&lt;ref name="Segel"&gt;Segel, Harold B. ''The Columbia Guide to the Literatures of Eastern Europe Since 1945'', p.247. Columbia University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-231-11404-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], he solidly supported the new [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist]] leadership and ardently promoted [[Socialist realism in Romania|socialist realism]]. Most of his postwar poetry deals with the struggle against fascism, the Romanian revolutionary tradition going back to 1848, and championing the new regime's ideology. Despite his political engagement, his poetry rose above the level of a verse pamphleteer. His postwar volumes of poetry include ''Ceea ce nu se uită'' ("What Cannot Be Forgotten", 1945); ''Scutul păcii'' ("The Shield of Peace", 1949); ''Poeme de pace şi de luptă'' ("Poems of Peace and War", 1950); ''În satul lui Sahia'' ("In [[Alexandru Sahia|Sahia]]'s Village", 1952); ''Bălcescu'' (1952), a long poem written in honour of the historian and revolutionary [[Nicolae Bălcescu]]; and ''Cîntecele pădurii tinere'' ("Songs of the Young Forest", 1953).&lt;ref name="Segel"/&gt;

Jebeleanu first achieved international recognition with his collection of humanitarian poems about the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]]: ''Surîsul Hiroşimei'' ("The Smile of Hiroshima", 1958). After an "oratorio" celebrating the liberation at the end of the war, ''Oratoriul eliberării'' ("The Oratorio of Liberation", 1959), and a volume of selected verse, ''Poezii şi poeme'' ("Poems", 1961), he published one of his most highly regarded collections of poems, ''Lidice, Cîntece împotriva morţii'' ("Lidice, Songs against Death", 1963). In the same spirit of universal humanism as ''Surîsul Hiroşimei'', his new collection was inspired by a postwar visit to the site of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] village of [[Lidice]], which together with its inhabitants was totally destroyed by the Nazis during World War II as an act of revenge.&lt;ref name="Segel"/&gt;

Jebeleanu's other publications include ''Din veacul XX'' ("From the Twentieth Century", 1956), a collection of journalistic texts; ''Poeme, 1944-1964'' ("Poems, 1944-1964", 1964); ''Elegie pentru floarea secerată'' ("Elegy for the Cut Flower", 1966), one of his important collections of lyrics and a break from his previous engaged poetry; ''Hanibal'' ("Hannibal", 1972), a volume of poems; and ''Deasupra zilei'' ("Above the Day", 1981), a book of "jottings" on various subjects.&lt;ref name="Segel"/&gt; In the 1970s, the [[Romanian Academy]], of which he was a member, nominated him for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.slope.org/archive/seven/eugen.html Slope]'', November–December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=J ''Membrii Academiei Române''], at the [[Romanian Academy]] site; retrieved April 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Although initially a supporter of the regime, he expressed alarm after the [[July Theses]] were issued in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, Dennis. ''Ceauşescu and the Securitate'', p.185. M.E. Sharpe, 1995, {{ISBN|1-56324-633-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, considered one of the leaders of the liberal wing of the [[Writers' Union of Romania]], was dropped from the Romanian Communist Party's central committee at its 13th Congress in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, Vladmimir.

The Fair Housing Initiatives (FHIP) Program is managed by the [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] at the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]].  The program provides funding to fair housing organizations and other non-profits who assist people who believe they have been victims of [[housing discrimination]].  The FHIP program is the only Federal grant program whose purpose is to support private partnerships in preventing and overcoming housing discrimination.

==History of the Program==
The Fair Housing Initiatives Program began with the passage of Section 561 of the [[Housing and Community Development Act of 1987]] (42 U.S.C. 3616; P.L. 100-242), as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.

==Types of FHIP grants==
* The Fair Housing Organizations Initiative (FHOI)- FHOI provides funding to existing non-profit fair housing organizations.  The funding is intended to build capacity and effectiveness of these organizations by providing funds to handle fair housing enforcement and education initiatives.  FHOI also strengthens the fair housing movement nationally by encouraging the creation and growth of organizations that focus on the rights and needs of underserved groups, particularly persons with disabilities.
*The Private Enforcement Initiative (PEI)- offers a range of assistance to the nationwide network of fair housing groups.  This initiatives funds non-profit fair housing organizations to carry out testing and enforcement activities to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices.
*The Education and Outreach Initiative (EOI)- This grant is meant to increase activities to local communities to teach about fair housing rights and responsibilities.  These grants are given to State agencies, local government groups, and non-profit organizations for initiatives that explain to the general public and housing providers what equal opportunity in housing means and what housing providers need to do to comply with the Fair housing Act.  In recent years, one of the main goals of the EOI grants is to protect the public from lending schemes that prey upon minority homeowners by educating the public about what they can do if they are facing foreclosure and how to be suspicious of foreclosure programs.

==Eligible grantees==

*FHIP-FHOI: Applicants must be qualified fair housing enforcement organizations with at least two years of experience in complaint intake, complaint investigation, testing for fair housing violations, and meritorious claims in the three years prior to the filing of their application.
*FHIP-PEI: Fair housing enforcement organizations that meet certain requirements related to the length and quality of previous fair housing enforcement experience may apply for FHIP-PEI funding.
*FHIP-EOI: State or local governments, qualified fair housing enforcement organizations (those with at least 2 years of experience), other fair housing organizations, and other public or private nonprofit organizations representing groups of persons protected by the Fair Housing Act may apply for FHIP-EOI funding.

[[Image:Franziska.png|thumb|300px|Different types of francisca.]]
The '''francisca''' (or '''francesca''') is a [[throwing axe]] used as a weapon during the [[Early Middle Ages]] by the [[Franks]], among whom it was a characteristic national weapon at the time of the [[Merovingian]]s from about 500 to 750 and is known to have been used during the reign of [[Charlemagne]] (768–814).&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite book |last2=Blair |first2=Claude |last1=Tarassuk |first1=Leonid |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJbyPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Complete+Encyclopedia+of+Arms+and+Weapons&amp;cd=1 |year=1982 |title=The Complete Encyclopedia of Arms and Weapons: the most comprehensive reference work ever published on arms and armor from prehistoric times to the present with over 1,250 illustrations |page=186 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=0-671-42257-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although generally associated with the Franks, it was also used by other [[Germanic peoples]] of the period, including the [[Anglo-Saxons]]; several examples have been found in [[England]].&lt;ref name=Underwood&gt;Underwood, Richard (1999). ''Anglo-Saxon Weapons and Warfare''. p.35-37. [[Tempus Publishing]]. {{ISBN|0-7524-1910-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Francisca.jpg|thumb|Francisca on display in Romano-Germanic Museum in Cologne, Germany]]
[[Image:Franziska Weingarten Grab 510.jpg|thumb|Blade of a Francisca of the Alamannic graveyard of Weingarten (6th century)]]
The term ''francisca'' first appeared in the book ''[[Etymologiae|Etymologiarum sive originum]], libri XVIII'' by [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560–636) as a name used in [[Hispania]] to refer to these weapons "because of their use by the Franks".

The historian [[Gregory of Tours]] (c. 538–594) in his ''History of the Franks'' uses two [[Latin]] terms for the Frankish axe: ''securis'' and ''bipennis''.

The régime of [[Vichy France]] used the image of a stylised double-headed ''francisque'' as part of its iconography (compare [[fasces]]).

==Description==
The francisca is characterized by its distinctly arch-shaped head, widening toward the cutting edge and terminating in a prominent point at both the upper and lower corners. The top of the head is usually either S-shaped or [[Wikt:convex|convex]] with the lower portion curving inward and forming an elbow with the short wooden [[handle (grip)|haft]].&lt;ref name=Blair/&gt;&lt;ref name=Underwood/&gt; Sometimes the head is more upswept, forming a wider angle with the haft. Most franciscas have a round or teardrop-shaped eye designed to fit the tapered haft, similar to [[Viking]] axes. Based on the measurements of modern [[replicas]], the francisca had a haft length of around 40–45&amp;nbsp;cm (16–18&amp;nbsp;in) and a 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;in) cutting edge [http://therionarms.com/reenact/therionarms_c399.html][http://www.silvermane.com/Francisca.html] with an average weight of around 600 g (21 oz, 1.3&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name=Blair/&gt; Based on the surviving heads of franciscas recovered at [[Burgh Castle]] and [[Morning Thorpe]] in county [[Norfolk]], England,&lt;ref name=Underwood/&gt; the length of the head itself measured 14–15&amp;nbsp;cm (5–6&amp;nbsp;in) from the edge to the back of the socket.

==Use==

The [[Roman Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Procopius]] (c. 500–565) described the Franks and their use of throwing axes:

{{quote|...each man carried a [[sword]] and [[shield]] and an axe. Now the iron head of this weapon was thick and exceedingly sharp on both sides while the wooden handle was very short. And they are accustomed always to throw these axes at one signal in the first charge and thus shatter the shields of the enemy and kill the men.&lt;ref name=Underwood/&gt;}}

Procopius makes it clear that the Franks threw their axes immediately before [[hand to hand combat]] with the purpose of breaking shields and disrupting the enemy line while possibly wounding or killing an enemy [[warrior]]. The weight of the head and length of the haft would allow the axe to be thrown with considerable momentum to an effective range of about 12&amp;nbsp;m (40&amp;nbsp;ft). Even if the edge of the blade were not to strike the target, the weight of the iron head could cause injury. The francisca also had a psychological effect, in that, on the throwing of the francisca, the enemy might turn and run in the fear that another volley was coming.&lt;ref name=Underwood/&gt;

{{Update|date=November 2018|reason=Much of the information on this article is old (not out of date). There have been many other studies, critiques, etc. of gender bias on Wikipedia and the article must be updated to reflect that.}}
[[File:LE15_Gender_overall_in_2018.png|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Pie chart for gender of Wikipedia editors: 90% male, 9% female, and 1% transsexual or transgender|Wikipedia editors surveyed by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] in 2018 were predominantly male.]]

'''Gender bias on Wikipedia''' reflects the fact that a dominant majority of volunteer Wikipedia editors, particularly on the [[English Wikipedia|English-language site]], are male. This has led to Wikipedia having fewer and less extensive articles about women or topics important to women.

It figures among the most frequent [[criticism of Wikipedia|criticisms of Wikipedia]], and part of a more general criticism about [[systemic bias in Wikipedia]]. The [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which runs Wikipedia, agrees with these criticisms and has made an ongoing attempt to increase female editorship of Wikipedia. [[Edit-a-thon]]s have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.

''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed out that Wikipedia's female participation rate may be in line with other "public thought-leadership forums".&lt;ref name=Cohen110130 /&gt; In 2009, a Wikimedia Foundation survey revealed that 6% of editors who made more than 500 edits were female, with the average male editor having twice as many edits.&lt;ref name=Clubhouse&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~lam/papers/wp-gender-wikisym2011.pdf |title = WP:Clubhouse?

In the English Wikipedia and five other language editions that were studied by researchers, the ratio of articles about women to articles about men was higher than in three other databases. However, analysis with computational linguistics concluded that the way women and men are described in articles demonstrates bias, with articles about women more likely to overuse words relating to gender and family. The researchers believe that this is a sign Wikipedia editors consider male the "null gender" (in other words, that "male" is assumed unless otherwise specified).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.technologyreview.com/s/534616/computational-linguistics-reveals-how-wikipedia-articles-are-biased-against-women/ |title = Computational Linguistics Reveals How Wikipedia Articles Are Biased Against Women |last = arXiv |first = Emerging Technology from the |work = MIT Technology Review |access-date = 21 August 2017 |language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critique of Wikipedia's approach, from a 2014 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial, is that it has difficulty making judgments about "what matters". To illustrate this point they noted that [[List of pornographic actresses by decade|the page listing pornographic actresses]] was better organized than [[List of women writers|the page listing women writers]].&lt;ref name=GuardianAugust2014&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'' 2014 (London) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/guardian-view-wikipedia-evolving-truth The Guardian view on Wikipedia: evolving truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112212758/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/guardian-view-wikipedia-evolving-truth |date=November 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[United Nations University]] and [[UNU-MERIT]] jointly presented an overview of the results of a global Wikipedia survey.&lt;ref name=WPSurvey2010&gt;{{cite web |title = Wikipedia Survey: Overview Results |url = http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf |last1 = Glott |first1 = Ruediger |last2 = Schmidt |first2 = Philipp |last3 = Ghosh |first3 = Rishab |date = March 2010 |website =  |publisher =  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100414165445/http://wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf |archivedate = 14 April 2010 |accessdate = 11 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 30 January 2011, ''New York Times'' article cited this [[Wikimedia Foundation]] collaboration, which indicated that fewer than 13% of contributors to Wikipedia are women.  [[Sue Gardner]], then executive director of the foundation, said that increasing diversity was about making the encyclopedia "as good as it could be." Factors the article cited as possibly discouraging women from editing included the "obsessive fact-loving realm", associations with the "hard-driving hacker crowd," and the necessity to be "open to very difficult, high-conflict people, even misogynists”.&lt;ref name=Cohen110130&gt;{{cite news |last = Cohen |first = Noam |date = 30 January 2011 |title = Define Gender Gap?

In February 2011, ''The New York Times'' followed up with a series of opinions on the subject under the banner, "Where Are the Women in Wikipedia?"&lt;ref name=WhereAretheWomen&gt;{{cite news |author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date = 2 February 2011 |title = Where Are the Women in Wikipedia? |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 9 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140715112226/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia |archivedate = 15 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Herring|Susan C. Herring]], a professor of information science and linguistics, said that she was not surprised by the Wikipedia contributors gender gap. She said that the often contentious nature of Wikipedia article "talk" pages, where article content is discussed, is unappealing to many women, "if not outright intimidating."&lt;ref name=Herring110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Herring |first = Susan C. |date = 4 February 2011 |title = Communication Styles Make a Difference |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/communication-styles-make-a-difference |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 11 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140724050237/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/communication-styles-make-a-difference |archivedate = 24 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Reagle|Joseph M. Reagle]] reacted similarly, saying that the combination of a "culture of hacker elitism," combined with the disproportionate effect of high-conflict members (a minority) on the community atmosphere, can make it unappealing. He said, "the ideology and rhetoric of freedom and openness can then be used (a) to suppress concerns about inappropriate or offensive speech as "censorship" and (b) to rationalize low female participation as simply a matter of their personal preference and choice."&lt;ref name=Reagle110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Reagle |first = Joseph M. |date = 4 February 2011 |title = 'Open' Doesn't Include Everyone |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/open-doesnt-include-everyone |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 11 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140715113229/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/open-doesnt-include-everyone |archivedate = 15 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justine Cassell]] said that although women are as knowledgeable as men, and as able to defend their point of view, "it is still the case in American society that debate, contention, and vigorous defense of one’s position is often still seen as a male stance, and women’s use of these speech styles can call forth negative evaluations."&lt;ref name=Cassell110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Cassell |first = Justine |date = 4 February 2011 |title = Editing Wars Behind the Scenes |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170227113525/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars |archivedate = 27 February 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[International Journal of Communication]]'' published research by Reagle and Lauren Rhue that examined the coverage, gender representation, and article length of thousands of biographical subjects on the English-language Wikipedia and the online ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. They concluded that Wikipedia provided better coverage and longer articles in general, that Wikipedia typically has more articles on women than ''Britannica'' in absolute terms, but Wikipedia articles on women were more likely to be missing than articles on men relative to ''Britannica''. That is, Wikipedia dominated ''Britannica'' in biographical coverage, but more so when it comes to men. Similarly, one might say that ''Britannica'' is more balanced in whom it neglects to cover than Wikipedia. For both reference works, article length did not consistently differ by gender.&lt;ref name="Reagle-Rhue"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Reagle |first1 = Joseph |last2 = Rhue |first2 = Lauren |title = Gender Bias in Wikipedia and ''Britannica'' |url = http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631 |year = 2011 |journal = International Journal of Communication |volume = 5 |publisher = Joseph Reagle &amp; Lauren Rhue |pages = 1138–1158 |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160322081809/http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631 |archivedate = 22 March 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation conducted its first semi-annual Wikipedia survey. It suggested that 9% of Wikipedia editors are women. It also reported, "Contrary to the perception of some, our data shows that very few women editors feel like they have been harassed, and very few feel Wikipedia is a sexualized environment."&lt;ref name=WES2011&gt;{{cite web |url = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Editor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf |title = Wikipedia Editors Study: Results From ''The Editor Survey, April 2011'' |date = April 2011 |website = [[Wikipedia]] |accessdate = 18 May 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141226041321/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Editor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf |archivedate = 26 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an October 2011 paper at the [[WikiSym|International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration]] found evidence that suggested that Wikipedia may have "a culture that may be resistant to female participation".&lt;ref name=WPClubhouse&gt;{{cite conference |last1 = Lam |first1 = Shyong K. |last2 = Uduwage |first2 = Anuradha |last3 = Dong |first3 = Zhenhua |last4 = Sen |first4 = Shilad |last5 = Musicant |first5 = David R. |last6 = Terveen |first6 = Loren |last7 = Reidl |first7 = John |date = October 2011 |title = WP:Clubhouse?

A study published in 2014 found that there is also an "Internet skills gap" with regard to Wikipedia editors. The authors found that the most likely Wikipedia contributors are high-skilled men and that there is no gender gap among low-skilled editors, and concluded that the "skills gap" exacerbates the gender gap among editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Hargittai |first1 = Eszter |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Aaron |title = Mind the skills gap: the role of Internet know-how and gender in differentiated contributions to Wikipedia |journal = Information, Communication &amp; Society |date = 4 November 2014 |pages = 1–19 |doi = 10.1080/1369118X.2014.957711 |volume = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2010–14, women made up 61% of participants of the college courses arranged by the Wiki Education Foundation program that included editing Wikipedia as part of the curriculum. Their contributions were found to shift the Wikipedia content from pop-culture and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] towards social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/23/6727564/bruce-maiman-wikipedia-grows-up.html |title = Wikipedia grows up on college campuses |author = Bruce Maiman |date = 23 September 2014 |website = [[The Sacramento Bee]] |accessdate = 23 September 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140923224639/http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/23/6727564/bruce-maiman-wikipedia-grows-up.html |archivedate = 23 September 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors also found structural differences in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for information-seeking activities.

A 2017 study found that women participating in an experiment by editing a Wikipedia-like site tended to view other editors as male, and to view their responses as more critical than if the other editor was [[gender-neutral]]. The study concluded that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Shane-Simpson |first1=Christina |last2=Gillespie-Lynch |first2=Kristen |title=Examining potential mechanisms underlying the Wikipedia gender gap through a collaborative editing task |journal=[[Computers in Human Behavior]] |date=January 2017 |volume=66 |pages=312–328 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.043|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01612306/document }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote |text = ...visible female editors on Wikipedia and broader encouragement of the use of constructive feedback may begin to alleviate the Wikipedia gender gap. Furthermore, the relatively high proportion of anonymous editors may exacerbate the Wikipedia gender gap, as anonymity may often be perceived as male and more critical.}}

A study by Ford and Wajcman observes that research on the gender bias continues to frame the problem as a deficit in women. In contrast, their central argument states that infrastructure studies in [[feminist technoscience]] allows the gender analysis to be taken to a further level. It looks at three issues within the infrastructure: content policies, software and the legalistic framework of operation. It suggests that progress can be made through altering that culture of [[knowledge production]] through encouraging alternate knowledge, reducing the technical barriers to editing, and addressing the complexity of Wikipedia policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Ford |first1 = Heather |last2 = Wajcman |first2 = Judy |title = 'Anyone can edit', not everyone does: Wikipedia and the gender gap |journal = Social Studies of Science |date = 2017 |url = http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/ |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161228081909/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/ |archivedate = 28 December 2016 |df = dmy-all | doi = 10.1177/0306312717692172 |volume=47 |pages=511–527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, mathematician [[Marie A. Vitulli]] wrote in ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The percentage of women editors on Wikipedia remains dismally low."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201803/rnoti-p330.pdf|title=Writing Women in Mathematics into Wikipedia 65 (3). pp. 331–332. doi:10.1090/noti1650|last=Vitulli|first=Marie A.|date=March 2018|publisher=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|access-date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, when [[Donna Strickland]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], numerous write-ups mentioned that she did not previously have a Wikipedia page.

Several causes for this gender disparity have been suggested.

Lam ''et al''. suggest that there may be a culture which is non-inclusive of women on Wikipedia, which may be due to a disparity in male-to-female centric topics represented and edited, the tendency for female users to be more active in the [[Community of Wikipedia|social and community aspects of Wikipedia]], an increased likelihood that edits by new female editors are reverted, and/or that articles with high proportions of female editors are more contentious.&lt;ref name=WPClubhouse /&gt;

In July 2014, the [[National Science Foundation]] announced that it would spend $200,000 to study systemic gender bias on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freebeacon.com/issues/government-funded-study-why-is-wikipedia-sexist/ |title=Government-Funded Study: Why Is Wikipedia Sexist? |work=[[Washington Free Beacon]] |date=30 July 2014 |author= Elizabeth Harrington |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801062009/http://freebeacon.com/issues/government-funded-study-why-is-wikipedia-sexist/ |archivedate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article by Julia Adams and Hannah Brückner that was supported by the funding was published in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Julia |last1=Adams |first2=Hannah |last2=Brückner |title=Wikipedia, sociology, and the promise and pitfalls of Big Data |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951715614332|journal=Big Data &amp; Society |date=27 December 2015 |issn=2053-9517 |volume=2 |issue=2 |doi=10.1177/2053951715614332}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|reason=Please tell us what the report's findings were.

== Reactions ==

The Wikimedia Foundation has officially held, since at least 2011 when Gardner was executive director, that gender bias exists in the project. It has made some attempts to address it but Gardner has expressed frustration with the degree of success achieved. She has also noted that "in the very limited leisure time women had, they tended to be more involved in social activities instead of editing Wikipedia.

[[File:Giants in the field of Women in the Arts 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Attendees at the 2013 Women in the Arts edit-a-thon in Washington, DC]]

Dedicated [[edit-a-thon]]s have been organized to increase the coverage of women's topics in Wikipedia and to encourage more women to edit Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html |title = Closing Wikipedia’s Gender Gap — Reluctantly |work = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date = 11 February 2014 |accessdate = 27 August 2014 |author = Stoeffel |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140902160836/http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html |archivedate = 2 September 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These events are supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, which sometimes provides mentors and technology to help guide newer editors through the process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8054">'''Giacomo Medici''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] antiquities smuggler and [[art dealer]] who was convicted in 2004 of dealing in [[Antiquities trade|stolen ancient artifacts]]. His operation was thought to be "one of the largest and most sophisticated antiquities networks in the world, responsible for illegally digging up and spiriting away thousands of top-drawer pieces and passing them on to the most elite end of the international art market".&lt;ref name="vogue 46"&gt;''[[Men's Vogue]]'', Nov/Dec 2006, Vol. 2, No. 3, pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in the illegal antiquities trade==

Thanks to a long-running major investigation by the ''[[Tutela Patrimonio Culturale]]'' (or ''TCP'', the unit of the Italian [[Carabinieri]] ([[military police]]) specializing in protecting that country's [[cultural heritage]]), Giacomo Medici was eventually charged, tried and convicted for his key role in an extensive and highly lucrative international antiquities smuggling ring. 

For nearly 40 years, the group organised the systematic looting and theft of some of the most valuable Mediterranean artefacts ever found, "laundering" these stolen objects through corrupt international dealers and major auction houses, who then sold them on to major institutions and collectors around the world. Probably the best-known object linked to the Medici gang is the so-called "Sarpedon krater", a unique, signed Attic "[[Pottery_of_ancient_Greece#Red_figure|red figure]]" wine vessel dating from the 5th century BCE, which was painted by [[Euphronios]], one of the most famous ceramic artists of the ancient world. The krater was eventually shown to have been looted from a previously unknown [[Etruscan civilisation|Etruscan]] tomb near Cerveteri, Italy, in December 1971, and later sold to the New York [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1972 for the then record price of US$1 million.

The staggering scale and value of the so-called "Medici conspiracy" was revealed in the 1990s by two fortuitous but connected events. The first was the downfall of former [[Sotheby's]] employee James Hodges, who in 1991 was tried and convicted of various charges related to his theft of antiquities and money from his employer. Unfortunately for Sotheby's - but very fortunately for investigators - prior to his arrest, Hodges had stolen or photocopied a number of internal Sotheby's documents which indicated that the company was behaving dishonestly and unethically in regard to the trading of antiquities. After Hodges' crimes were discovered, he tried to make a deal, using the stolen documents as a bargaining tool, but when Sotheby's refused, Hodges took revenge by passing the material to investigative journalist Peter Watson. Hodges' documents sparked a series of British press investigations into Sotheby's activities, and although not conclusive in their own right, they would also provide vital corroboration for the even more sensational discoveries made by Italian authorities in the mid-1990s.

The second fortuitous event was the death of one of the smuggling ring's main organisers, Pasquale Camera, a former captain in the Italian customs agency. When Camera was killed in a car accident in August 1995, police found dozens of photographs of stolen antiquities in the glove compartment of his car, which directly linked Camera to a recent theft of valuable antiquities from an Italian regional museum. Subsequent raids by the TCP uncovered a large hoard of stolen and looted antiquities of the highest quality, as well as an extraordinary collection of documents and photographs that chronicled the smuggling ring's operations in forensic detail. Most importantly of all, the raid on the Rome apartment of one of the smugglers yielded a crucial piece of evidence that enabled the TCP to break the entire ring wide open - it was a comprehensive organisational chart, handwritten by Camera himself, which named and linked every major player in the operation, including the gangs of ''[[tombaroli]]'' (tomb robbers) and their leaders, the middle-men (including Medici) who smuggled the looted treasures out of Italy and other countries, the corrupt international dealers (including British dealer [[Robin Symes]] and American dealer [[Robert E. Hecht]]) who traded the stolen goods through major auction houses - notably [[Sotheby's]] in London - and even the unscrupulous curators, institutions, and private collectors who purchased looted goods from the gang. 

The paperwork also revealed that a Swiss-based holding company named Editions Services (the successor to his earlier Hydra Galleries in Rome) was  operated by a "frontman" on Medici's behalf, that Editions Services shared the same Zurich address with the antiques company owned by British dealer [[Robin Symes]], and that Editions Services had sold three ancient marble sculptures previously stolen from an Italian collection.&lt;ref name="vogue 44"&gt;''Men's Vogue'', Nov/Dec 2006, Vol. 2, No. 3, pg. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, 1995, Italian and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] police raided the Editions Services offices in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] which were located in Port Franc, "the special commercial zone near the airport where international goods can be stored, bought, and sold, discreetly and tax-free".&lt;ref name="vogue 44" /&gt;

Authorities found "hundreds of pieces of ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] art — including a set of Etruscan dinner plates valued at $2 million ... voluminous sales records and correspondence between Medici and dealers in [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]]; and finally, binders and boxes containing thousands of photographs ... of ancient objects ... the archive included sequential photographs of single pieces from the moment they came out of the ground ... to their finished, reconstructed appearance at the time they entered the art market and were sold for tens of thousands, and occasionally millions, of dollars. In a few cases there were even subsequent photos of the same objects inside the display cases of well-known museums".&lt;ref name="vogue 46" /&gt; The forensic archaeologists investigating the Medici documents even discovered shocking photographic evidence that the gang had illegally excavated and looted at least one previously-undiscovered Roman villa in [[Pompeii]], ruthlessly hacking several complete frescoes off the walls in [[laptop]]-sized pieces in order to steal them.

Medici was formally arrested in 1997, and in 2004 was sentenced by a [[Rome]] court to ten years in prison and a fine of 10 million [[Euro]]s, "the largest penalty ever meted out for antiquities crime in Italy".&lt;ref name="vogue 46" /&gt;

In 2005, evidence from the Geneva raid was used by the Italian government to indict American antiquities dealer [[Robert E. Hecht]] and former [[Getty Center|J. Paul Getty Museum]] curator of antiquities [[Marion True]] for conspiracy to traffic in illegal antiquities. The court hearings of the case against Hecht and True ended in 2012 and 2010, respectively, as the statute of limitations, under Italian law, for their alleged crimes had expired.&lt;ref&gt;Povoledo, Elisabetta.

''[[The New York Times]]''. 18 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medici's operation is detailed in [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] and [[Cecilia Todeschini]]'s 2006 book ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums''.

'''Grendel's mother''' ({{lang-ang|Grendles mōðor}}) is one of three [[antagonist]]s in the anonymous [[Old English literature|Old English poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' (c. 700–1000 AD). The other antagonists are [[Grendel]] and the [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]], all aligned in opposition to the hero [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]]. She is introduced in lines 1258b to 1259a as: "Grendles modor/ides, aglæcwif".

Grendel's mother, who is never given a name in the text, is the subject of ongoing controversy among [[medieval]] [[scholars]]. This is due to the ambiguity of a few [[Old English language|words in Old English]] which appear in the original [[Nowell Codex|''Beowulf'' manuscript]]. While there is consensus over the word "modor" (mother), the phrase "ides, aglæcwif" is the subject of scholarly debate.

==Story==
{{main|Beowulf}}
The poem, ''[[Beowulf]],'' is contained in the [[Nowell Codex]]. As noted in lines 106–114 and lines 1260–1267 of ''Beowulf,'' monsters (which include Grendel's mother and [[Grendel]]) are descendants of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]]. After Grendel is killed, Grendel's mother attacks [[Heorot]] in revenge. Beowulf then ventures into her cave under a lake, and engages in fierce combat with Grendel's mother. She nearly kills him until he sees an ancient sword, which he kills her with, and beheads the dead Grendel. Beowulf then returns to the surface and to his men at the "ninth hour" (l. 1600, "nōn", about 3&amp;nbsp;pm).&lt;ref&gt;Jack, George. ''Beowulf: A Student Edition,'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function in and structure of the poem==
[[Image:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|150 px|right|The first page of the ''[[Beowulf]]'' manuscript.]]
Some scholars have argued that the female characters in ''Beowulf'' fulfill certain established roles such as ''hostess'' ([[Wealhþeow]] and [[Hygd]]) and [[peace-weaver]] ([[Freawaru]] and [[Hildeburh]]). Grendel's mother and [[Modthryth]] (before her marriage to [[Offa of Angel|Offa]]), who challenge these roles, represent "monster-women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first= Dorothy | last=Porter| url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/5/porter1.html| title=The Social Centrality of Women in ''Beowulf'': A New Context| journal=The Heroic Age: A Journal of Early Medieval Northwestern Europe |issue=5| date=Summer–Autumn 2001| accessdate=2006-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane Chance argues in "The Structural Unity of ''Beowulf'': The Problem of Grendel's Mother"&lt;ref name="Chance"&gt;Nitzsche, Jane Chance (1980). "The Structural Unity of ''Beowulf'': The Problem of Grendel's Mother." ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language'' '''22'''(3): 287–303. {{JSTOR|40754612}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there are two standard interpretations of the poem: one view which suggests a two-part structure (i.e., the poem is divided between Beowulf's battles with [[Grendel]] and with the dragon) and the other, a three-part structure (this interpretation argues that Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother is structurally separate from his battle with Grendel). Chance stated that, "this view of the structure as two-part has generally prevailed since its inception in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'' in ''Proceedings of the British Academy 22'' (1936)."&lt;ref name="Chance"/&gt; In contrast, she argued that the three-part structure has become "increasingly popular".&lt;ref name="Chance"/&gt; She later developed this argument in ''Woman as Hero in Old English Literature.''&lt;ref&gt;Nitzsche, Jane Chance. ''Woman as Hero in Old English Literature.'' Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates on Grendel's mother==
There is ongoing debate among medieval scholars concerning the ambiguity of a few [[Old English language|words in Old English]] (related to Grendel's mother) which appear in the original ''[[Nowell Codex|Beowulf manuscript]]''. Because these terms are ambiguous, scholars disagree over aspects of her nature and appearance. Indeed, because her exact appearance is never directly described in [[Old English]] by the original ''Beowulf'' poet, part of the debate revolves around what is known, namely her descent from the biblical [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] (who was the first murderer, according to the [[Abrahamic religion]]s).  For some scholars, this descent links her and Grendel to the monsters and giants of the ''[[Cain tradition]],''&lt;ref&gt;[[David Williams (medievalist)|Williams, David]]. ''Cain and Beowulf: A Study in Secular Allegory''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; while others such as Kevin Kiernan in ''Grendel's Heroic Mother''&lt;ref&gt;Kiernan, Kevin S. "[http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/iconic/GrendelesHeroicMother.htm Grendel's Heroic Mother]." In ''Geardagum: Essays on Old English Language and Literature'' 6 (1984): 13–33.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that there is "plenty of evidence for defending Grendel's mother as a heroic figure" &lt;ref&gt;Kiernan, Kevin S. "[http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/iconic/GrendelesHeroicMother.htm Grendel's Heroic Mother]." In ''Geardagum: Essays on Old English Language and Literature'' 6 (1984): 31.&lt;/ref&gt; as she "accepted and adhered to the heroic ethic of the blood-feud, the main difference between Grendel's feckless feud with the noise at Heorot and his mother's purposeful one exacting retribution for the death of her son. In heroic terms, her vengeance for the death of her kinsman Grendel."&lt;ref&gt;Kiernan, Kevin S. "[http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/iconic/GrendelesHeroicMother.htm Grendel's Heroic Mother]." In ''Geardagum: Essays on Old English Language and Literature'' 6 (1984): 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This lack of consensus has led to the production of a few seminal texts by scholars over the past few decades. One important focus of these articles and books concerns the numerous, and at times opposing, translations of especially the [[Old English]] compound "ides aglæcwif" (1259a).

===Monster or demon===
Until the late 1970s, all scholarship on Grendel's mother and translations of the phrase "aglæc-wif" were influenced by the edition of noted ''Beowulf'' scholar [[Frederick Klaeber]]. His edition, ''Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg'', has been considered a standard in ''Beowulf'' scholarship since its first publication in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_language_quarterly/v060/60.2bloomfield.pdf Bloomfield, Josephine. Benevolent Authoritarianism in Klaeber's Beowulf: An Editorial Translation of Kingship. "Modern Language Quarterly 60:2, June 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Klaeber's glossary, "aglæc-wif" translates as: "wretch, or monster of a woman". Klaeber's glossary also defines "aglæca/æglæca" as "monster, demon, fiend" when referring to [[Grendel]] or Grendel's mother and as "warrior, hero" when referring to the character [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Klaeber|Klaeber, Frederick]]. ''Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg''. Third ed. Boston: Heath, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaeber has influenced many translations of ''Beowulf.'' Notable interpretations of  "aglæc-wif" which follow Klaeber include "monstrous hell bride" (Heaney),&lt;ref name="Beowulf: A New Verse Translation"&gt;[[Seamus Heaney|Heaney, Seamus]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0393320979&amp;id=ynD9o-LfTDMC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=4rtZ-a90PG&amp;dq=Beowulf:+A+New+Verse+Translation&amp;sig=TANJDD5siOW13PupnLi4qiw6SYk Beowulf: A New Verse Translation]''. New York: Norton, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; "monster-woman" (Chickering) &lt;ref&gt;Chickering, Howell D. ''Beowulf''. Garden City: Anchor, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; "woman, monster-wife" (Donaldson),&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, E. Talbot, and Nicholas Howe. ''Beowulf : A Prose Translation : Backgrounds and Contexts, Criticism''. 2nd ed. New York: Norton, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; "Ugly troll-lady" (Trask) &lt;ref&gt;Trask, Richard M. ''Beowulf and Judith : Two Heroes''. Lanham: UP of America, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and "monstrous hag" (Kennedy).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Charles W., and tr. ''Beowulf, the Oldest English Epic''. New York: Oxford UP, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doreen M.E. Gillam's 1961 essay, "The Use of the Term 'Æglæca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592," explores Klaeber's dual use of the term "aglæca/æglæca" for the heroes [[Sigmund|Sigemund]] and Beowulf as well as for Grendel and Grendel's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Gillam, Doreen M. "The Use of the Term 'Aeglaeca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592." ''Studia Germanica Gandensia'' 3 (1961): 145–69.&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that "aglæca/æglæca" is used in works besides ''Beowulf'' to reference both "devils and human beings". She further argues that this term is used to imply "supernatural," "unnatural" or even "inhuman" characteristics, as well as hostility towards other creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Gillam, Doreen M. "The Use of the Term 'Aeglaeca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592." ''Studia Germanica Gandensia'' 3 (1961).&lt;/ref&gt; Gillam suggests: "Beowulf, the champion of men against monsters, is almost inhuman himself. [Aglæca/æglæca] epitomises, in one word, the altogether exceptional nature of the dragon fight. Beowulf, the champion of good, the 'monster' amongst men, challenges the traditional incarnation of evil, the Dragon: æglæca meets æglæcan."&lt;ref&gt;Gillam, Doreen M. "The Use of the Term 'Aeglaeca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592." ''Studia Germanica Gandensia'' 3 (1961):169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ides/dis (lady)===
[[Image:ValkyrieOnHorse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A sculpture of a valkyrie on a horse by [[Stephan Sinding]] (1908)]]
[[Image:Gefion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Gefion Fountain]] in Copenhagen, Denmark by Anders Bundgård, 1908.]]
[[Image:Freya by Penrose.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Freyja, depicted in a painting by J. Penrose.]]

The [[Old English language|Old English]] ''[[Idis (Germanic)|ides]]'', [[Old High German]] ''itis'' and Old Norse ''[[dís]]'' are cognates that all mean "lady,"&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;The article ''[http://runeberg.org/nfbf/0272.html Dis]'' in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1907).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''idisi'' appears as the name of the [[Valkyrie]]s in the only surviving pagan source in [[Old High German]], the ''[[Merseburg Incantations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, Thomas. ''An Anthology of German Literature'', D. C. Heath &amp; co. ASIN: B0008BTK3E,B00089RS3K.  P5.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, in [[Norse mythology]], the ''[[Dísir]]'' ('ladies') are fate goddesses who can be both benevolent and antagonistic towards mortal people.

Consequently, many have pointed out that ''dís'' is probably the original term for the [[valkyrie]]s (lit. "choosers of the slain"), which in turn would be a [[kenning]] for ''dís''.&lt;ref&gt;'''Including:''' Ström, Folke (1954) ''Diser, nornor, valkyrjor: Fruktberhetskult och sakralt kungadöme i Norden''; Näsström, and Britt-Mari (1995) ''Freyja: The Great Goddess of the North''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few scholars have drawn from the work of [[Eric Stanley]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Stanley|Stanley, Eric]]. "[http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/23/8/339 Did Beowulf Commit 'Feaxfeng' against Grendel's Mother]" ''Notes and Queries'' 23 (1976): 339–40. {{doi|10.1093/nq/23-8-339}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Eric. "Two Old English Poetic Phrases Insufficiently Understood for Literary Criticism: Þing Gehegan and Senoþ Gehegan." ''Old English Poetry: Essays on Style''. Ed. Daniel G. Calder. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979. 67–90.&lt;/ref&gt; by exploring the term ''ides'' as "lady" when discussing Grendel's mother, such as Temple ("Grendel's Lady-Mother," 1986)&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Mary Kay. "Beowulf 1258–1266: Grendel's Lady Mother." ''English Language Notes'' 23.3 (March 1986): 10–15.&lt;/ref&gt; and Taylor&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Keith. "Beowulf 1259a: The Inherent Nobility of Grendel's Mother." ''English Language Notes'' 31.3 (March 1994): 13–25.&lt;/ref&gt; (who argues in his 1994 essay that the term ''Ides'' indicates that "Grendel's mother is a woman of inherently noble status.")&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Keith. "Beowulf 1259a: The Inherent Nobility of Grendel's Mother." ''English Language Notes'' 31.3 (March 1994): 18&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, others have suggested that Grendel's mother may be associated with the [[Norse paganism|Norse]] figures of the [[valkyrie]]s and of the goddess [[Gefjun|Gefion]] who may be an extension of [[Gefjun#Possible connections with Frigg and Freyja|Frigg and Freyja]]. [[Freyja]], the daughter of the sea god [[Njörðr]], was both a [[fertility goddess]] and a goddess of [[war]], [[battle]], [[death]], [[seiðr]], [[prophecy]] and was also sometimes [[Valkyrie#Connections with Freyja|associated with the valkyries and disir]].

[[Nora Kershaw Chadwick]] (1959)&lt;ref&gt;[[Nora Kershaw Chadwick|Chadwick, Nora K.]] "The Monsters and Beowulf." ''The Anglo-Saxons: Studies in Some Aspects of Their History''. Ed. Peter ed Clemoes. London: Bowes &amp; Bowes, 1959. 171–203.&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Helen Damico]] in two works (''Beowulf's Wealhtheow and the Valkyrie Tradition''&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Damico|Damico, Helen]]. ''Beowulf's Wealhtheow and the Valkyrie Tradition.'' Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Valkyrie Reflex in Old English Literature")&lt;ref&gt;Damico, Helen. "The Valkyrie Reflex in Old English Literature." In ''New Readings on Women in Old English Literature''. Eds. Helen Damico and Alexandra Hennessey Olsen. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. 176–89&lt;/ref&gt; argue that Grendel's mother may refer to the myth of the valkyries. Damico states:

{{quote|in both their benevolent and malevolent aspects, the valkyries are related to a generic group of half-mortal, half-supernatural beings called ''idisi'' in Old High German, ''ides'' in Old English, and ''dis'' in Old Norse, plural, ''disir''. Both groups are closely allied in aspect and function: they are armed, powerful, priestly [...] The Beowulf poet follows the tradition of depicting the valkyrie-figure as a deadly battle demon in his characterization of Grendel's Mother. As Chadwick has argued, Grendel's Mother, that ''wælgæst wæfre'' 'roaming slaughter-spirit' epitomizes the earlier concept of the valkyrie.&lt;ref name=reflex&gt;Damico, Helen. "The Valkyrie Reflex in Old English Literature." In ''New Readings on Women in Old English Literature,'' Eds. Helen Damico and Alexandra Hennessey Olsen. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990: 176, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Damico later argues in ''Beowulf's Wealhtheow and the Valkyrie Tradition'' that Wealtheow and Grendel's mother represent different aspects of the valkyries.

Frank Battaglia also draws on the term "ides" by pairing it with "dis".&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "[http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-1991q2-00415 The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf]." ''Mankind Quarterly'' 31.4 (Summer 1991): 415–46.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that the "dis" were "female guardian spirit[s]" with "power over the dead and choosing who would die. In this capacity [they] might be feared."&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "[http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-1991q2-00415 The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf]" in ''Mankind Quarterly'', page 433. Summer 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Battaglia thus suggests that Grendel's mother is the Early Germanic goddess Gefion (whom he states was also a form of [[Nerthus]] and Freyja).&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf" in ''Mankind Quarterly'', page 415–17. Summer 1991&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that: "in scaldic poetry the word ''dis'' means goddess [...] [[Freyja|Freyia]] herself is called ''Vanadis,'' that is, ''dis'' of the Vanir, the Scandinavian [[chthonic]], fertility deities."&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf" in ''Mankind Quarterly'', page 436. Summer 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Battaglia then notes that Gefion is referenced five times in the poem: l.49 (''géafon on gársecg'' – "Gefion on the waves"), l.362 (''ofer geofenes begang'' –  "over Gefion's realm"), l.515 (''geofon ýþum'' – "Gefion welled up in waves"), l.1394 (''né on gyfenes grund'' – "Ground of Gefion"), and l.1690 (''gifen géotende'' – "Gefion gushing"). In addition, he indicates that "in Old English poetry, geofon is a word for ocean which has been seen since [[Jakob Grimm]] (1968, 198) as related to the name Gefion of the Danish Earth Goddess ... power to divide land and sea is shown by representations of Gefion in Norse literature."&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf" in ''The Mankind Quarterly'', page 416. Summer 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aglæcwif (warrior)===
Contemporary scholars have suggested that the use of the term "aglæcwif" indicates that Grendel's mother is a [[women warriors in literature and culture|woman warrior]]. In 1979, ''Beowulf'' scholars Kuhn and Stanley argued against Klaeber's reading of Grendel's mother. In ''Old English Aglaeca-Middle Irish Olach''&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Sherman M. "Old English Aglaeca-Middle Irish Olach." In ''Linguistic Method: Essays in Honor of Herbert Penzl''. Eds. Irmengard Rauch and Gerald F. Carr. The Hague, New York: Mouton Publishers, 1979. 213–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman Kuhn questioned Klaeber's translations of both "aglæc-wif" and of "aglæca / æglæca" when referring to Grendel and Grendel's mother, stating that there are {{quote|five disputed instances of áglæca [three of which are in ''Beowulf''] 649, 1269, 1512 ... In the first ... the referent can be either Beowulf or Grendel. If the poet and his audience felt the word to have two meanings, 'monster', and 'hero', the ambiguity would be troublesome; but if by áglæca they understood a 'fighter', the ambiguity would be of little consequence, for battle was destined for both Beowulf and Grendel and both were fierce fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, S. (1979). "Old English Aglæca-Middle Irish Olach." ''Linguistic Method: Essays in Honor of Herbert Penzl,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;216–217. Mouton Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus Kuhn suggested aglæca should be defined as  "a fighter, valiant warrior, dangerous opponent, one who struggles fiercely". &lt;ref name="Kuhn218"&gt;Kuhn, S. (1979). "Old English Aglæca-Middle Irish Olach." ''Linguistic Method: Essays in Honor of Herbert Penzl'', p.&amp;nbsp;218. Mouton Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; He supported his argument by also stating that, "if there were one clear instance of áglæca referring to an unwarlike monster, a peaceful demon, or the like, this definition would fall apart."&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, S. (1979). "Old English Aglæca-Middle Irish Olach." ''Linguistic Method: Essays in Honor of Herbert Penzl'', p.&amp;nbsp;227. Mouton Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn concluded that {{quote|Grendel's mother was an 'aglæc-wif', 'a female warrior' [...] there is no more reason to introduce the idea of monstrosity or of misery here than there is in line 1519 where she is called ''merewif'', defined simply as 'water-woman', 'woman of the mere'.&lt;ref name="Kuhn218"/&gt;}}

[[Eric Stanley]] added to the debate by critiquing both Klaeber and Gillam: {{quote|Grendel is described as an æglæca, a word which we do not understand. One scholar [Gillam] has, in fact, made investigation of this word a model for the methodology of establishing meaning. The attempt is of interest, but in the end we always come back to the fact that, as Klaeber's glossary shows, the word is used by the poet not only to describe Grendel as here, and later in the poem to describe the dragon, and the monsters of the mere as they attack Beowulf, but also Beowulf himself; and at one point the two enemies, Beowulf and the dragon, are described together using the plural æglæcean. As we assemble the many uses including compounds [...] it becomes clear that it is not pejorative in force. We must not follow Klaeber's distinction of 'wretch, monster, demon, fiend' for Beowulf's enemies, and 'warrior, hero' for Beowulf himself; and we must not abuse Grendel's mother when she is called aglæcwif by translating the word as Klaeber does, 'wretch,' or 'monster, of a woman.' We must never forget that she is called there ides aglæcwif (1259) and ''[[Idis (Germanic)|ides]]'', 'lady,' is not a term of abuse [...] the poet does not speak of his monsters abusively.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, E.G. (1979). "Two Old English Poetic Phrases Insufficiently Understood for Literary Criticism : Þing Gehegan and Senoþ Gehegan." ''Old English Poetry: Essays on Style'', pp.&amp;nbsp;75–76. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Other scholars have offered varying opinions on this topic. Christine Alfano also questioned standard translations related to Grendel's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Alfano, Christine.  (1992). "[http://repositories.cdlib.org/cmrs/comitatus/vol23/iss1/art1/ The Issue of Feminine Monstrosity: A Re-evaluation of Grendel's Mother]." ''Comitatus'', 23: 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; She states that she found a "noticeable disparity between the Grendel's mother originally created by the ''Beowulf'' poet and the one that occupies contemporary ''Beowulf'' translations. Instead of being what Sherman Kuhn calls a 'female warrior', the modern Grendel's mother is a monster. This assumption informs almost all areas of ''Beowulf'' scholarship, although there is little evidence for this characterization in the original Anglo-Saxon work."&lt;ref&gt;Alfano, Christine.  (1992). "[http://repositories.cdlib.org/cmrs/comitatus/vol23/iss1/art1/ The Issue of Feminine Monstrosity: A Re-evaluation of Grendel's Mother]." ''Comitatus'', 23: 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Melinda Menzer offered a different approach,&lt;ref&gt;Menzer, Melinda J. (September 1996). "Aglaecwif (Beowulf 1259a): Implications for -Wif Compounds, Grendel's Mother, and Other Aglaecan." ''English language notes'' 34.1: 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that "aglæcwif denotes a woman, a human female, who is also aglæca."&lt;ref&gt;Menzer, Melinda J. (September 1996). "Aglaecwif (Beowulf 1259a): Implications for -Wif Compounds, Grendel's Mother, and Other Aglaecan." English language notes 34.1: 2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dictionary of Old English ====
The ''[[Dictionary of Old English]]'', [[University of Toronto]], made the following updates in 1994:
* ''āglāc-wíf'' (noun) is translated as ''female warrior, fearsome woman''.
* ''āglæca'' (adj.) is translated as ''formidable, awe-inspiring''
* ''āglæca'' (noun) is translated as ''awesome opponent, ferocious fighter''&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Angus, et al. (1986 / 1994). "Aglac-Wif to Aglaeca." ''[[Dictionary of Old English]]''.

"'''Gump Roast'''" is the seventeenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''’ [[The Simpsons (season 13)|thirteenth season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on April 21, 2002. In the episode, [[Homer Simpson]] is honored by the townspeople at a Friars' Club [[Roast (comedy)|Roast]], until it is interrupted by [[Kang and Kodos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCann|2005 |pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was directed by [[Mark Kirkland]] and was written by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and his wife [[Deb Lacusta]]. The plot idea for the episode came about when ''The Simpsons'' cast members were on hiatus following a payment dispute. This is the fifth and, so far, the last [[clip show]] ''The Simpsons'' has produced. Instead, the series implements one "trilogy episode" each season. When it was first broadcast, "Gump Roast" received a 5.7 rating and was watched by 12.2 million viewers, making it the 16th most watched television show of the night. However, following its release on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]], the episode received negative reviews from critics.

[[Homer Simpson]] sits [[Forrest Gump|on a park bench holding a box of chocolates]], when [[Chief Wiggum]] appears to arrest him for impersonating a movie character. Homer tells Wiggum a story that he is not interested in at first, but becomes more intrigued when Homer uses flashbacks to help him tell the story. The Simpson family then arrives to take Homer to the Friars’ Club, where he is [[Roast (comedy)|roasted]] by [[Krusty the Clown]] and other prominent citizens of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. Among those roasting him are his son [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], his daughter [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and his boss [[Mr. Burns]] who tries to warn the people of Springfield of Homer's incompetence which, much to his dismay, they think is a joke. The roasters utilize more clips from previous episodes.

Soon, [[Kang and Kodos]] arrive at the roast and declare that humans are stupid, as demonstrated by more clips. However, when they probe Homer's baby daughter [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]'s brain and see her memories through a monitor, the emotional impact is too much for them that they cry with joy, but angrily attempt to hide it by saying that they were vomiting from their eyes. However, Maggie's mind also reveals more clips, this time consisting of various celebrities. Kang and Kodos and the citizens make a deal, they agree to spare the Earth if everyone agrees to give them a place in the People's Choice Awards. They do, and Kang and Kodos enjoy the award ceremony. The episode ends with the song "They’ll Never Stop the Simpsons", which recounts additional past plots, possible future plots, and an apology for airing this clip show.

==Production==
[[File:Dan Castellaneta cropped.jpg|170px|left|thumb|[[Dan Castellaneta]] wrote the episode with his wife [[Deb Lacusta]].]]
"Gump Roast" was co-written by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and his wife [[Deb Lacusta]], while [[Mark Kirkland]] served as director. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 21, 2002.&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;Jean, Al. (2010). Commentary for "Gump Roast", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the episode came about when Castellaneta and the other main ''Simpsons'' cast members were on hiatus while renegotiating their salaries. During the hiatus, Lacusta and Castellaneta were discussing the film ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' and questioned whether the stories Gump told actually happened, or if he made them up. They then compared the character to Homer, since they are both dimwitted and have "fumbled into" many different situations. Writing ensued, and when the cast members had settled the payment issue, Castellaneta and Lacusta presented the script to [[show runner]] [[Al Jean]], who put the script into production.&lt;ref name="Lacusta"&gt;Lacusta, Deb. (2010). Commentary for "Gump Roast", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clip in which Homer skis down a mountain is one of the most used clips during events, according to Jean. One of the plot turns in the episode sees Kang and Kodos interrupting the roast. These characters normally only appear in Halloween episodes, however since "Gump Roast" is a clip show and therefore not in ''The Simpsons'' canon, Kang and Kodos were included in the episode. Since "Gump Roast", there has not been any more clip shows of ''The Simpsons''. Jean stated in the DVD commentary for the episode, that since the show now produces "trilogy episodes" (episodes that have three separate stories for each act) each season after season 13, making a clip show would be unnecessary.&lt;ref name="Jean" /&gt;

The song "They'll Never Stop The Simpsons" playing at the end of the episode was written by ''Simpsons'' writer [[Matt Selman]] and sung by Castellaneta. It is a parody on the song “[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]” by [[Billy Joel]], and was originally the same length as the song it was based on. However, because the episode was too long, the song had to be cut to its current length.&lt;ref name="Selman"&gt;Selman, Matt. (2010). Commentary for "Gump Roast", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the song was re-recorded with alternative lyrics as a promotional video after ''The Simpsons'' was renewed for an additional 24th and 25th season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Snierson |first=Dan |title='The Simpsons' promo reacts to two-season renewal -- First Look Video |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/10/13/simpsons-renewal-promo/ |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=November 1, 2011 |date=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castellaneta came in and recorded eight new takes, which was mixed together with some of the original vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ledesma |first=Chris |title=The "Secret Song" Is Out! |url=http://simpsonsmusic500.wordpress.com/2011/10/13/the-secret-song-is-out/ |work=Simpsons Music 500 |accessdate=November 1, 2011 |date=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The opening scene, which shows Homer sitting on a bench holding a box of chocolates, is a reference to the movie ''Forrest Gump''. At one point Homer drunkenly quotes the film ''[[Secrets &amp; Lies (film)|Secrets &amp; Lies]]''. The act that [[Ned Flanders]] and [[Reverend Lovejoy]] are performing at the roast is an homage to the [[Smothers Brothers]], who would later appear on ''The Simpsons'' in the episode “[[O Brother, Where Bart Thou?]]”.&lt;ref name="Jean" /&gt; Moe dresses as [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]] from the comedy film series.

Following the home video release of the thirteenth season of ''The Simpsons'', "Gump Roast" received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics.

'''Henry Royston Loyn''' (16 June 1922 – 9 October 2000), [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]], was a British historian specialising in the [[history of Anglo-Saxon England]]. His eminence in his field made him a natural candidate to run the [[Sylloge of the Coins of the British Isles]], which he chaired from 1979 to 1993. He was Professor of Medieval History in the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire and afterwards Professor of Medieval History at [[Westfield College]] in the University of London.&lt;ref&gt;Loyn, H. R. (1962) ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest''. Harlow: Longman; p. iii, back wrapper (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
The Sylloge's natural emphasis is on [[Anglo-Saxon numismatics]]. Loyn's mastery of an extensive and specialised literature in an often-contentious area of history produced over four decades a series of cautious, even conservative syntheses of continuity and evolving changes in late Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman England, universally well received in the academic press, which are still staples of student reading-lists.

Aside from numerous articles, occasional lectures such as ''The "matter of Britain": A historian's perspective'' (a Creighton Trust lecture), and his main publications (''see below''), he edited ''The Middle Ages: A Concise Encyclopedia''.
He has been praised for his "felicitous, economic writing style"&lt;ref&gt;C. Warren Hollister, reviewing ''The Norman Conquest'' in ''American Historical Review''. 1966:534.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hyperpersonal model''' is a model of interpersonal communication that suggests [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) can become hyperpersonal because it "exceeds [face-to-face] interaction", thus affording message senders a host of communicative advantages over traditional face-to-face (FtF) interaction.&lt;ref name="Walther"&gt;Walther, J. B. (1996). Computer-mediated communication: Impersonal, [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonal]], and hyperpersonal interaction. Communication Research, 23, 3-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to ordinary FtF situations, a hyperpersonal message sender has a greater ability to strategically develop and edit self-presentation, enabling a selective and optimized presentation of one's self to others.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

Communication professor [[Joseph Walther]] is credited with the development of this theory in 1996, after extensive research on computer-mediated communication.

== Conditions and Key Components ==

=== Conditions: ===
The hyperpersonal model specifies conditions favorable to either interpersonal or impersonal interaction. The hyperpersonal model addresses three questions: 1) when is mediated interaction impersonal; 2) when is CMC interpersonal; and 3) when is CMC hyperpersonal? Hyperpersonal communication, according to Walther, is "more socially desirable than we tend to experience in parallel FtF interaction" (p.&amp;nbsp;17).&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;   Combinations of media attributes, social phenomena, and social-psychological processes may lead CMC to become "hyperpersonal", that is, to exceed face-to-face (FtF) communication. This perspective suggests that CMC users may experience greater levels of intimacy, unity and liking within a group or [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] than similar groups or dyads interacting FtF.

=== Key Components: ===

====Senders====
This component refers to "selective self-presentation".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walther|first=Joseph B.|last2=Liang|first2=Yuhua Jake|last3=DeAndrea|first3=David C.|last4=Tong|first4=Stephanie Tom|last5=Carr|first5=Caleb T.|last6=Spottswood|first6=Erin L.|last7=Amichai-Hamburger|first7=Yair|date=2011-03-09|title=The Effect of Feedback on Identity Shift in Computer-Mediated Communication|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F15213269.2010.547832|journal=Media Psychology|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–26|doi=10.1080/15213269.2010.547832|issn=1521-3269}}&lt;/ref&gt; In CMC, message senders have a greater opportunity to optimize their self-presentation. Walther argues, "[CMC participants] were better able to plan, and had increased opportunity to [[Self-censorship|self-censor]]. With more time for message construction and less stress of ongoing interaction, users may have taken the opportunity to [[objective self-awareness]], reflection, selection and transmission of preferable cues."&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; Message senders use the process of selective self-presentation, which refers to CMC users' ability to manage their online image. Being able to self-censor and manipulate messages is possible to do within a CMC context to a greater extent than in FtF interactions, so individuals have greater control over what cues are sent. Walther points out that asynchronous messages and reduced communication cues contribute to selective [[self-presentation]].&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; In CMC, communicators may inflate attributions about their communication partners. When communication partners are geographically dispersed, individuals are likely to make positive attributions if group salience is high. As a result, members are more likely to make attributions of similarity that lead to greater liking for partners. Paralinguistic cues are used as part of assessing communication partners when using CMC. Selective self-presentation provides an avenue for people to manage their image in a manner that FtF interaction does not.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;  Reduced communication cues and potentially asynchronous communication are both common in CMC.

''Reduced Cues'': CMC reduces cues present in normal FtF interactions. In CMC, first impressions aren't based on physical, and instead rely on information and personality. Senders impressions are more malleable than in an in-person interaction.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

Walther cites a study by Chilcoat and DeWine (1985) in which three interpersonal perceptions were examined (attractiveness, attitude similarity, and credibility) against three asynchronous communication vehicles (FtF, videoconferencing, and audioconferencing). One would expect FtF to produce higher ratings for the interpersonal characteristics, but the opposite was true: audioconferencing partners produced higher ratings of their partners' attractiveness, attitude similarity, and credibility than in videoconference or FtF interaction.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

====Receivers====
This component refers to "idealization".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Walther argues that receivers have an "idealized perception" of the message sender in CMC. He says that the [[social identity model of deindividuation effects]] (SIDE) predicts that subtle context cues take on a strong value in CMC. The absence of FtF cues leads to the fact that receivers may be very sensitive to any subtle social or personality cues that occur in CMC communication this way, CMC partners build impressions of one another on minimal cues. With fewer cues on which to base their perceptions, receivers have to "fill in the gaps" of their understanding of the other interactant and often assume more positive characteristics of them. In other words, without FtF cues to mediate the interaction, participants may assume their partner is a "better person" than they actually are.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

====Asynchronous channel====
Since CMC doesn't require [[Compresence|copresence]] the way FtF communication does, members can take part in activities at their own convenience, taking advantaged of disentrained communication channels. Walther cites a relaxation of time constraints in CMC, often allowing for an asynchronous mode of communication. For example, with [[group communication]], "...Making temporal commitments becomes discretionary. Group members may attend to the group process independently in time. When partners may attend their groups at their convenience, limitations on the amount of partners' mutual time available for meetings are less problematic."&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

Disentrained channels—most often [[asynchronous communication]], via email or forums—gives individuals a way to manage their relationships within groups more efficiently than via FtF. Using asynchronous communication, such as email, individuals are able to manage group relationships in a way that maximizes time spent on group tasks. Through the process of entrainment, people synchronize their activities to meet the requirements of the group's needs, which is constrained by each individuals time and attention.  Entrainment can make it difficult for groups to complete tasks together since it requires FtF, and thus synchronous, communication, which may include off-topic discussions that hinder productivity. Asynchronous communication may mitigate entrainment associated with group interaction. According to Walther, asynchronous group interaction may not be constrained by time and/or competing commitments.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; Group members using asynchronous communication can devote their full attention to the group when they have the opportunity. Greater attention can be spent focusing on tasks related to the group rather than spending time and effort on communication that is irrelevant to the goal.

According to Walther, CMC removes temporal limitations, thereby freeing time constraints. "Both task-oriented and socially oriented exchanges may take place without one constraining the time available for the other.

====Feedback processes====
Walther argues that the ''[[behavioral confirmation]]'' - "reciprocal influence that partners exert" in sender-receiver roles&amp;nbsp;— is magnified in minimal-cue interaction like CMC. In other words, in CMC communication, we behave based on the expectation of the other and the social data occurring in communication process is selectively sent and perceived by communicators.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; Feedback between sender and receiver is a critical part of the communication interaction for relationship development in either FtF or CMC relationships. However, feedback in a minimal-cue environment may be magnified. Behavioral confirmation is the process of communication partners developing impressions and intimacy as a result of interaction.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; In CMC, behavioral confirmation along with magnification can become idealized, leading CMC partners to develop greater affinity for CMC partners than he or she might develop in a FtF context.  This kind of CMC interaction fosters the development of an intensification loop, explaining the hyperpersonal relationships that develop in a cues-limited environment.

As the last component of hyperpersonal model, it is conceptualized as reciprocal interaction with others that strengthens one’s online performance by bringing together the identity transforming potentials embedded within the other theoretical components.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Foundations of the Model ==

===FtF vs. CMC===
In [[face-to-face communication]], physical features such as appearance, facial expressions, gesture and postures is exposed to others, which can help to convey nonverbal information to help with the communication. Face-to-face communication is formed naturally in emotional, cognitive and physical aspects. Those [[Nonverbal language|nonverbal languages]] are the cues that lack in CMC communication.&lt;ref name="Walther'2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walther|first=J. B.|year=2007|title=Selective self-presentation in computer-mediated communication: Hyperpersonal dimensions of technology, language, and cognition|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=23|issue=5|pages=2538–2557|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2006.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that the lack of nonverbal cues in CMC may decrease one's capability of fostering and managing accurate impression on others.&lt;ref name="Walther'2007" /&gt; Additionally, the lack of nonverbal cues leads to the fact that CMC communication involves less emotional elements than FtF communication does, which contributes to less richness and interpersonal and expressive cues that may provide more positive impression.&lt;ref name="Okdie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Okdie|first=B. M.|author2=Guadagno, R. E.|author3=Bernieri, F. J.|author4=Geers, A. L.|author5=Mclarney-Vesotski, A. R.|year=2011|title=Getting to know you: Face-to-face versus online interactions|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=27|pages=153–159|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.07.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While other holds the opposite opinions. Walther suggested in his research in 1996 that CMC can actually improve the interpersonal bond between senders and receivers because of the lack of nonverbal cues and demographic messages.&lt;ref name="Okdie" /&gt; Walther argued that nonverbal and demographic cues that occur in FtF communication play a distracting role; while in CMC communication, hyperpersonal interaction is created in which senders pay more attention on the strategy of delivering message so that the [[self-presentation]] is enhanced and optimized, which eventually improve the interpersonal interaction.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okdie" /&gt;

===Social information processing (SIP)===
Walther developed an alternate approach to the cues-filtered-out approach.&lt;ref name="Walther1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walther|first=J.B.|year=1992|title=Interpersonal effects in computer-mediated interaction: A relational perspective{{!}}journal|journal=Communication Research|volume=19|pages=52–90|doi=10.1177/009365092019001003}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Social information processing (theory)|social information-processing (SIP)]] viewpoint, Walther states that people naturally want to develop social relationships.&lt;ref name="Walther1992" /&gt; With SIP, the idea of the rate at which social information is exchanged is introduced. Additionally, SIP looks at verbal strategies used in mediated communication.&lt;ref name="Walther1992" /&gt; Individuals strategically use language to convey a myriad of information about the sender, enabling the receiver to make attributes about the sender. Yet if CMC really was impersonal, why were so many people adopting CMC for social purposes, such as online gaming, bulletin boards and online chat groups? Walther advanced a different model to explain the growing trend toward the use of CMC for social interaction.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;  When media attributes, social phenomena and social-psychological processes are integrated, the result is what Walther called "hyperpersonal."&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

==Development of the Model==

=== Three Phases of CMC: Impersonal, Interpersonal, Hyperpersonal ===
According to Walther's research(1996), the study of CMC went through three phases: from [[Impersonal communication|impersonal]], to [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonal]], and finally to hyperpersonal. First, because CMC shows no [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal cues]], some argued that CMC was more task-oriented than was FtF. The reasons are:
# The concentration on the content of communication will not be distracted by social or emotional influences, so that CMC can "promote rationality by providing essential discipline."&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;
# CMC is also advantageous in group decision making since it avoids the influence of pressure of peers and status.
# CMC can facilitate the efficiency of group work since it saves time when irrelevant interpersonal influence decreases.
# Group members can enjoy more "democratic" atmosphere in CMC than that in FtF communication. In addition, [[anonymity]], which can result in more freedom for members to verbalize without feeling pressure from high-status members, is one of the most important features of CMC.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;

Early CMC group research suggested that CMC groups were better for task-oriented interactions than their FtF counterparts. In task-oriented situations, where overly personal interpersonal interaction is not desired, then impersonal interaction is the appropriate kind of interaction, because the communication exchanges are more focused on the group's task. For example, a geographically dispersed technology team tasked with solving a software application bug may be more productive when the communication is task focused rather than interpersonal in nature. This doesn't mean that all CMC is impersonal, but points out that specific contexts may be better suited for impersonal interaction rather than personal exchanges.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;

Then, Walther stated that CMC is not always impersonal; instead, it can also develop social relationships. Although there is less social information exchange in CMC because of the absence of nonverbal cues, as the communication time increases, the exchange of social information is increasing accordingly. And the anticipation of future communication may make communicators to look for more information about the other. This mechanism leads to similar immediacy, similarity, composure, and receptivity as in FtF communication. However, there is a shortcoming. Since it takes time for CMC to achieve consensus, if the time for CMC is limited, the information exchanged will be much less than do FtF, which may impact the efficiency of group work.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;

Finally, Walther brought up the concept of hyperpersonal communication, which demonstrates that "CMC that is more socially desirable than we tend to experience in parallel FtF interaction."&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;  Walther proposes that CMC users do take part in hyperpersonal communication.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;  Senders and receivers engage in the process of selective-self presentation through the message they create and send. This can lead to the idealization of the sender by the receiver based on making attributions from available paralingual cues found in the message. This process is enhanced with asynchronous exchanges, letting both sender and receiver have ample time to consider the messages sent and received. Hyperpersonal interaction would be excessively or above normal personal interaction. In other words, online relationships can develop into hyperpersonal that is excessively personal. When users experience commonality and are self-aware, physically separated, and communicating via a limited-cues channel, they can selectively self-present and edit their communication, enabling them to construct and reciprocate representations of their partners and relations without the interference of environmental reality.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt; Hyperpersonal communication can thus be defined as computer-mediated interaction that is more attractive than experiences in similar FtF exchanges.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt; The hyperpersonal model can be understood by looking at the established communication processes that include sender, receiver, channel, and feedback. The sender uses the process of selective self-presentation; this refers to CMC users' ability to manage their online image. Being able to self-censor and manipulate messages is possible to do within a CMC context to a greater extent than in FtF interactions, so individuals have greater control over what cues are sent.

He made this argument in four aspects of the communication process: receivers, senders, characteristics of the channel, and feedback processes.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;

=== Relationship between Hyperpersonal Model and CMC ===
There are results showing that under CMC, relational intimacy increased faster than FtF.&lt;ref name="Hian"&gt;Schumaker, E. M. (2013). Exploring the hyperpersonal model: Determining the inflated nature of feedback in computer-mediated communication Available from Social Science Premium Collection. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1647746817&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One of the logics behind this finding is that hyperpersonal model is determining the inflated nature of feedback in CMC.&lt;ref name="Hian" /&gt;Online communication behaviors have the possibility to exaggerate the influence on self-expression or self-presentations and following internalization. The theoretical assumption of the inflated interpersonal feedback in CMC pointed out in the hyperpersonal model by Walther&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; is advanced by this research. Hyperpersonal model can be deemed as the theoretical framework for the research on exaggerated social process in CMC mainly from the following perspectives: 1)selective presentation, 2)Impression management, 3)Impression management in CMC, 4) idealized interpretation, 5)interpersonal feedback loop, 6)Identity shift, and 7) influence of feedback on identity shift.&lt;ref name="Hian" /&gt;

==Examples and application==

=== Relational Intimacy Comparison between CMC &amp; FtF ===

* Hian, Chuan, Trevor and Detenber's 2006 study shows support for the hyperpersonal model. They found that relational intimacy increased at a faster rate in CMC than in FtF interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hian, Chuan, Trevor and Detenber|first=Lee Bee, Sim Li, Tan Mon Kiat, Benjamin H.|date=April 2004|title=Getting to Know You: Exploring the Development of Relational Intimacy in Computer-mediated Communication|url=DOI: 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00290.x|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=9(3)|pages=|via=Researchgate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The hyperpersonal theory is also confirmed in a study of the disclosure-intimacy link in CMC vs FtF communication. Research proved that CMC "intensified the association between disclosure and intimacy relative to face-to-face interactions, and this intensification was fully mediated by increased interpersonal (relationship) attributions observed in the computer-mediated condition."&lt;ref&gt;L.

=== Online Relationships ===

==== Online Friendships ====

* In the article titled "'I've never clicked this much with anyone in my life': Trust and hyperpersonal communication in online friendships", Samantha Henderson and Michael Gilding (2004) explored the development of trust in hyperpersonal communication. They found that, in hyperpersonal communication, 1) online trust depends on the reputation of pseudonymous identities; 2) the online communication performance is essential in building up online trust; 3) hyperpersonal communication and online trust can be facilitated by [[Precommitment|pre-commitment]]; 4) situational factors in Western societies can help to promote the active trust in hyperpersonal communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henderson|first=S.|author2=Gilding, M.|year=2004|title='I've never clicked this much with anyone in my life': Trust and hyperpersonal communication in online friendships|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=6|issue=4|pages=487–506|doi=10.1177/146144804044331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Online Romantic Relationships ====

* Anderson and Emmers-Sommer used hyperpersonal theory to test their predictors of relationship satisfaction in online romantic relationships. Based on hyperpersonal theory, it's likely that users of CMC would feel more satisfaction in an online relationship since the communication is enhanced and there is a reduced number of cues on which to base the relationship.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Traci Anderson; Tara Emmers-Sommer (2006).

*Another research of "modality switching" between online and offline dating elaborates the role of hyperpersonal model takes in providing clues of self-presentation and self-disclosure in online dating. In terms of the [[self-disclosure]], in online dating which is hyperpersonal communication, there is a perceived anonymity which can accelerate the rate of self-disclosure. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Chih-Chien|last2=Chang|first2=Ya-Ting|date=2010-04-01|title=Cyber relationship motives: Scale development and validation|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/2010/00000038/00000003/art00001%3bjsessionid=1vdici4t5jpl1.x-ic-live-03|journal=Social Behavior and Personality: an international journal|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=289–300|doi=10.2224/sbp.2010.38.3.289|issn=0301-2212}}&lt;/ref&gt;As for [[self-presentation]], online daters portray idealized versions of selves.

The results of this study showed that participants became [[Self-awareness|self-aware]] once they were on their individual profile pages. Once participants edited their Facebook profile they reported high levels of self-esteem. These findings suggest that selective self representation in digital media leads to intensified relationship formation. Thus a high involvement on [[social media]] definitely enhances self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzales|first=Amy|author2=Jeffrey Hancock|date=17 February 2011|title=Mirror, Mirror on my Facebook Wall: Effects of Exposure to Facebook on Self-Esteem|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=1-2|issue=1–2|pages=79–83|doi=10.1089/cyber.2009.0411|pmid=21329447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lies on the Internet ===

*In their book "Truth, Lies &amp; Trust on the Internet" authors Monica Whilly and Adam Johnson also affirm the hyperpersonal model. They talk about the formation of hyperpersonal relationships being formed on the Internet due to extreme proximity and closeness. In this book they go one step further and talk about the issues of truth, lies and trust in these relationships. Several stories in the book talk about how the Internet's anonymity basically enables high levels of self disclosures in relationships which can in turn possibly lead to deception and flaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Truth, Lies &amp; trust on the internet|last=Whitty|first=Monica|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application in Medical Treatment ===

* Jeanine Warisse Turner, Jean A. Grube, and Jennifer Meyers discussed in their work, titled 'Developing an optimal match within online communities: An exploration of CMC support communities and traditional support', the application of hyperpersonal model in the context of cancer treatment. They found that: 1) CMC can play a significantly important role for patients to seek support, which confirmed the hyperpersonal model in the context of patients' communication; 2) the experience of face-to-face communication with a partner will enhance the relationship of hyperpersonal communication; 3) a deep face-to-face relationship may lead to an indirect way of communication since partners are concerned with offending others even though they still want to offer support, while CMC communication is more able to focus on a specific goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=J. W.|author2=Grube, J. A.|author3=Meyers, J.|date=June 2001|title=Developing an optimal match within online communities: An exploration of CMC support communities and traditional support|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=51|issue=2|pages=231–251|citeseerx=10.1.1.22.4250|doi=10.1093/joc/51.2.231}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2003, James D. Robinson and Jeanine Turner published a research titled 'Impersonal, interpersonal, and hyperpersonal social support: Cancer and older adults'. This study focused on the [[social support]] and supportive communication of the old with cancer. They explore this fact from the optimal matching perspective brought up by Cutrona and Russell (1990), which demonstrate that "successful socially supportive interactions ... occur when the type of support desired by the individual is of the same type as the social support efforts of the provider."&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=J. D.|author2=Turner, J.|year=2003|title=Impersonal, interpersonal, and hyperpersonal social support: Cancer and older adults|journal=Health Communication|volume=15|issue=2|pages=227–234|doi=10.1207/s15327027hc1502_10|pmid=12742773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this article, the authors cited several previous studies to confirm that hyperpersonal communication is helpful for the olds with cancer illness in seeking social support.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt;

=== Application in Group/Community Activities ===

* The hyperpersonal model posits that in the absences of cues available in FtF encounters, distributed partners form exaggerated impressions other group members. Pena, Walther and Hancock (2007) looked at perceptions of dominance in collocated virtual groups versus distributed groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pena|first=J.|author2=Walther, J.B.|author3=Hancock, J.T.|year=2007|title=Effects of geographic distribution on dominance perceptions in computer-mediated group|journal=Communication Research|volume=34|issue=3|pages=313–331|doi=10.1177/0093650207300431}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicate that collocated groups perceived member dominance to be less extreme than in distributed groups. But there appeared to be no difference in the way collocated group members and distributed group member's perceived dominance. This supports the assertion that CMC environments intensify impression development, as suggested by the hyperpersonal models element of selective self-presentation.
* One study looking at perceived behaviors of assigned versus emergent leaders in CMC groups found that the "[[Reification (knowledge representation)|reification]] of behavioral stereotypes through hyperpersonal CMC allows emergent leaders to develop greater recognition" (p.&amp;nbsp;2).&lt;ref name="Wickham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wickham|first=K.R.|author2=Walther, J.B.|year=2007|title=Perceived behaviors of emergent and assigned leaders in virtual groups|journal=International Journal of E-Collaboration|volume=35|pages=59–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The question posed by these authors was under which conditions, having an assigned group leader or an unassigned group leader, would a leader emerge in a CMC context. They speculated that leaders emerge in CMC groups, as suggested by the hyperpersonal model, through the development of online behaviors.&lt;ref name="Wickham" /&gt; Wickham and Walther found that in CMC groups, there is greater consensus among group members about the group leader when the leader emerges from the group opposed to leaders being assigned to the group.&lt;ref name="Wickham" /&gt; Within assigned leader groups, leaders were not rated as being more intelligent than other group members. In contrast, in unassigned leader groups, there was a strong associated between perceived intelligence and leader emergence.
*In another study by Anita L. Blanchard titled "Testing a sense of a model of a community" talks about group salience being higher on a virtual community, thus, reaffirming the hyperpersonal model assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=Anita|date=September 2008|title=Testing a model of sense of virtual community|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=24|issue=5|pages=2107–2123|citeseerx=10.1.1.156.1496|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2007.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social Anxiety ===

* Andrew C. High and Scott E. Caplan(2008) explore the application of hyperpersonal model in the context of mitigating [[social anxiety]] caused by the "desire to create a positive impression in social settings along with a general lack of [[self-presentation]]al confidence."&lt;ref name="High"&gt;{{cite journal|last=High|first=A. C.|author2=Caplan, S. E.|year=2008|title=Social anxiety and computer-mediated communication during initial interactions: Implications for the hyperpersonal perspective|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=25|issue=2009|pages=475–482|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2008.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result indicated that the association of social anxiety and people's perception of social anxiety and the association of social anxiety and one's partner's conversational satisfaction are contingent in CMC.&lt;ref name="High" /&gt;

=== Application in Traditional Communication Tools ===

* In a 2006 study on politeness of requests made via email and voicemail, Kirk Duthler determined that emails were ranked more polite because users had more time to compose their requests compared to the voicemail user. Duthler's study supports hyperpersonal theory. He said: "The filtering of nonverbal cues advantages communicators. Communicators are strategically enabled to manipulate their identity, time the transmission of their messages, and plan, organize, and edit their communication in pursuit of relational goals. Such strategic control in CMC can facilitate negotiation, relationship development, and social tasks."&lt;ref&gt;Duthler, Kirk W. (2006). The Politeness of Requests Made Via Email and Voicemail: Support for the Hyperpersonal Model. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 500-521.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In his thesis "Text messaging: The new venue of [[self-disclosure]]" in 2010, Steven Brunner thoroughly studied the text messaging as a relational enhancing device, from the perspectives of hyperpersonal theory, social penetration theory, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/749770382/|title=Text messaging: The new venue of self-disclosure - ProQuest|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing ===

* The evolution route of marketing has gone "from big and broad to small and hyeprpersonal". The interaction between customers and business processes in microlevel conversation through a hyper-personalized experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketingtechnews.net/news/2015/oct/14/situational-marketing-rise-hyper-personal-experience/|title=Situational marketing: The rise of the hyper-personal experience|last=Patel|first=Manish|date=14 October 2015|work=Marketing Tech|access-date=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==

Joyce Lamerichs and Hedwig F. M. Te Molder from the department of communication science at [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]] evaluate the ways in which [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) has thus far been conceptualized, proposing an alternative approach. They argue that traditional perspectives ignore participants' everyday understanding of media use and media characteristics by relying on an individualistic and cognitive framework. The social identity model of deindividuation effects model totally disregards identity construction in daily communication activities like talk, text &amp; email. In order to understand this they tried to re study online interaction and specifically studied an online forum on depression. It is shown that participants' identities do not so much mirror their inner worlds but are discourse practices in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamerchs|first=Joyce|author2=Hedwig Molder|date=December 2003|title=Computer-Mediated Communication: From a Cognitive to a Discursive Model|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=5|issue=4|pages=451–473|doi=10.1177/146144480354001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study by Sonja Utz titled "Social information processing in MUDS: The development of friendships in virtual worlds" conducted a study that actually examines friendships in the virtual world. This study revealed a high level of skepticism in participants when it came to CMC. This theory used the [[social information processing]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Utz|first=Sonia|year=2000|title=Social Information Processing in MUDs: The Development of Friendships in Virtual Worlds by Sonja Utz, Ph.D.|journal=Journal of Online Behavior|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related theory==

===SIDE model===
[[Social identity model of deindividuation effects|SIDE model]] is a recent development of [[Deindividuation|deindividuation theory]], refers to social identity/deindividuation model. It demonstrates that it is that the property of group identity increases, rather other that individual identity loses, that leading to the occurring changes of CMC users. SIDE model predicts that in CMC, the sense of self diminishes, while the sense of group increases. SIDE model is distinguished from classical deindividuation theory which put its focus on the sense of self rather than the sense of group identity.&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coleman|first=L. H.|author2=Paternite, C. E. |author3=Sherman, R. C. |title=A reexamination of deindividuation in synchronous computer-mediated communication|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=1999|volume=15|pages=51–65|doi=10.1016/s0747-5632(98)00032-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impression management===
In the work titled 'The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life' (1959), Goffman demonstrated that in FtF communication, people use verbal and nonverbal languages to present appropriately and favorably to others since they care about the image or impression they leave for others and others' perception towards them. This phenomenon is called [[impression management]]. While in text-based CMC, the modification of impression is limited to "language, [[Typography|typographic]], and [[Chronemics|chronemic]] information."&lt;ref name="Walther'2007" /&gt;

=== Deindividuation ===
[[Deindividuation]] is a social psychology theory being generally thought as the loss of [[self-awareness]] in [[Social group|groups]], though this is a matter of contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spears|first=Russell|date=2016-07-07|title=Deindividuation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199859870.013.25|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199859870.013.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpersonal communication ===
[[Interpersonal communication]] is a process of information exchange between two or more people. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/181517359|title=The international encyclopedia of communication|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Pub|others=Donsbach, Wolfgang, 1949-|isbn=9781405131995|location=Malden, MA|oclc=181517359}}&lt;/ref&gt;This research generally contributes to six categories of inquiry: 1) how humans adapt their [[verbal communication]] and [[nonverbal communication]] during [[face-to-face communication]], 2) the message production processes. 3)  how uncertainty influences our behavior and information-management strategies, 4) [[Interpersonal deception theory|deceptive communication]], 5) [[relational dialectics]], and 6) social interaction that is [[Computer-mediated communication|mediated by technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Charles R|date=2005-09-01|title=Interpersonal communication: Theoretical perspectives, future prospects|url=|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=55 (3)|pages=415–447|via=doi:10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb02680.x.

=== Media richness theory ===
[[Media richness theory]], also sometimes referred to as information richness theory/MRT, is introduced by [[Richard L. Daft]] and Robert H. Lengel in 1986 as an extension of information processing theory. It is a framework aiming to describe a communication medium's ability in reproducing the information sent over it.

=== Nonverbal communication ===
[[Nonverbal communication]] is communication process sending and receiving information in the form of wordless cues.

'''Imperative mandate''' ({{lang-uk|Імперативний мандат}}) commonly refers to a provision in the [[Constitution of Ukraine|Constitution]] of [[Ukraine]] in which members of the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukrainian parliament) are bound by the constitution and laws of Ukraine to remain members of the parliamentary faction or bloc in which they were elected. Imperative mandate provisions were defined in the Constitution in articles [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 78|Articles 78]] and [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 81|81]].

==History==
The provision was introduced in the Constitution during the [[Constitution of Ukraine#Amendments|2004 Constitutional Amendments]] on December 8, 2004.&lt;ref name=PACEcrt&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/85146/ Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe: The functioning of democratic institutions in Ukraine], [[Kyiv Post]] (October 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Ukrainian law|type=Verkhovna Rada decree|number=2222-IV|law=2222-15|name=About the amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine|date=2004-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006 Ukrainian political crisis]] by [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] applied the provision while dissolving the parliament in April 2007 after members of the opposition [[party switching|crossed party lines]] to join the [[Alliance of National Unity]] to undermine his authority and reach a 300-MP constitutional majority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uWLfGt3eiRkC&amp;pg=PA38 Ukraine on Its Way to Europe, Interim Results of the Orange Revolution] by [[Juliane Besters-Dilger]], [[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]], 2009, {{ISBN|3631588895}} (page 38)&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2010 the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]] overturned the 2004 Constitutional Amendments, considering them unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/84619/ Update: Return to 1996 Constitution strengthens president, raises legal questions], [[Kyiv Post]] (October 1, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Several individual joined other factions already on October 5, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/50057/ Seven individual MPs join Regions Party faction, Our Ukraine MP joins Lytvyn Bloc] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120153322/http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/50057/ |date=January 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Verkhovna Rada canceled the law's provision after amending the regulations of its activities on October 8, 2010;&lt;ref name=FINANCIAL&gt;[http://www.finchannel.com/Main_News/Ukraine/72720_Rada_Approves_Cancellation_Of_Rule_That_Bans_Deputies_From_Switching_Factions_/ Rada Approves Cancellation Of Rule That Bans Deputies From Switching Factions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009194535/http://www.finchannel.com/Main_News/Ukraine/72720_Rada_Approves_Cancellation_Of_Rule_That_Bans_Deputies_From_Switching_Factions_/ |date=October 9, 2010 }}, [[The Financial]] (October 8, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; since then only 15 or more deputies can form a parliamentary faction, a lawmaker can join only one faction (the chairman and his two assistants cannot head factions of deputies)&lt;ref name=FINANCIAL/&gt;&lt;ref name=1996rulesagain&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/85569/ Rada amends regulations of its activities], [[Kyiv Post]] (October 8, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and deputies who are expelled from factions or decide to leave them become individual lawmakers; individual deputies are allowed to unite into parliamentary groups of people's deputies then again at least 15 deputies are required for the formation of such groups.&lt;ref name=FINANCIAL/&gt;&lt;ref name=1996rulesagain/&gt;

===2014 reinstatement===

On 21 February 2014 the parliament passed a law that reinstated the December 8, 2004 amendments of the constitution.&lt;ref name="bt2004UCIU21214"/&gt; This was passed under simplified procedure without any decision of the relevant committee and was passed in the first and the second reading in one voting by 386 deputies.&lt;ref name="bt2004UCIU21214"/&gt; The law was approved by 140 MPs of the [[Party of Regions]], 89 MPs of [[Batkivshchyna]], 40 MPs of [[UDAR]], 32 of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communist Party]], and 50 independent lawmakers.&lt;ref name="bt2004UCIU21214"&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/191727.html Ukrainian parliament reinstates 2004 Constitution], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (21 February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petro Poroshenko Bloc]] MPs [[Mykola Tomenko]] and [[Yehor Firsov]] parliamentary mandates were terminated (due to a decision by the Petro Poroshenko Bloc party congress) by the provision in March 2016.&lt;ref name="TouVrJ16IM"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2016/07/28/7116192/ Tomenko lost the court of its mandate and will complain to Europe], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (28 July 2016)&lt;br&gt;[http://www.unian.info/politics/1300725-bpp-congress-moves-to-terminate-powers-of-mps-tomenko-firsov.html BPP Congress moves to terminate powers of MPs Tomenko, Firsov], [[UNIAN]] (25 March 2016)&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|title=People's deputy of Ukraine VIII convocation Mykola Tomenko|url=http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/site2/p_deputat?d_id=5415&amp;skl=9|website=Official portal|publisher=[[Verkhovna Rada|Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine]]|accessdate=9 October 2016|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice the Imperative mandate causes the deprivation of the mandate of deputies who leave their faction by their own initiative while  deputies who are removed from their faction become an independent MP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unian.info/m/politics/2284531-operation-embarrassment.html Operation "Embarrassment"], [[UNIAN]] (7 December 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Imperative mandate provisions had been the subject of criticism by the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] as being undemocratic till its end.&lt;ref name=PACEcrt/&gt; In the Assembly's 2007 report on the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe - Resolution 1549 (2007) Functioning of democratic institutions in Ukraine &lt;sup&gt;(items 8 and 9)&lt;/sup&gt; it wrote:

{{Cquote|The Assembly calls on the political forces of Ukraine, as a matter of urgency, to resume working on the improvement of the Constitution of Ukraine and the related legislation in order to establish at last an effective system of checks and balances and bring constitutional provisions in line with European standards. Constitutional reform should be part of the discussions aimed at the resolution of the current political crisis. The Assembly expresses its expectation that the Venice Commission will be actively involved in the process of drafting constitutional reform proposals.

The Assembly reaffirms that the recall of people's representatives by the political parties ("imperative mandate") is unacceptable in a democratic state. The relevant constitutional provisions need to be abrogated in line with the recommendations of the Venice Commission in 2004; similar provisions also need to be deleted from ordinary legislation. The Assembly believes that a consistent political programme, responsible and committed party membership and scrupulous screening of parties' candidates are more effective tools for encouraging party and faction discipline.}}

The '''''Introducing...''''' series is a book series of graphic guides covering key thinkers and topics in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and science, and many others in politics, religion, cultural studies, [[linguistics]] and other areas. Books are written by an expert in the field and illustrated, comic-book style, by a leading [[graphic artist]].

==History==
The ''Introducing...'' series, like the ''[[For Beginners, LLC|For Beginners]]'' series, has its origins in two Spanish-language books, ''Cuba para principiantes'' (1960) and ''Marx para principiantes'' (1972) by the Mexican political cartoonist and writer [[Rius]], pocket books which put their content over in a humorous comic book way but with a serious underlying purpose.  An English-language version of the first book was published in 1970 by [[Leviathan Press]] of San Francisco and [[Pathfinder Press]] of New York, to no particularly great impact.  However, when [[Richard Appignanesi]] edited the first English edition of ''Marx for Beginners'' (1976) for the London-based [[Writers and Readers Publishing Cooperative]], of which he was a co-founding member with [[Glenn Thompson (publisher)|Glenn Thompson]] and others, it was soon clear that the collective had a hit on their hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.introducingbooks.com/page/history The history of Introducing books], introducingbooks.com.

The line's most enduring titles, all published during this period, were ''Marx for Beginners'' (1976), ''Freud for Beginners'' (1979), ''[[Einstein for Beginners]]'' (1979), and ''[[Darwin for Beginners]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name="for beginners"&gt;MacDonald, H. (2003), [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20031222/39466-pantheon-re-offers-for-beginners-series.html "Pantheon re-offers 'for beginners' series,"] ''Publishers Weekly'', 250(51), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s schism arose over questions of control after some members of the [[cooperative]] sold U.S. rights to part of the ''For Beginners'' series to [[Pantheon Books]] and the Cooperative officially disbanded in 1984. 

In 1992, Richard Appignanesi, who had been the first editor in London for the series and had also written several of the titles, co-created the new London-based publisher [[Icon Books]], under whose imprint he republished several of the ''For Beginner'' titles and continued to publish and expand a new version of the series. Meanwhile, Glenn Thompson, who, since 1987, had continued the ''For Beginners'' through his New York-based [[Writers and Readers Publishing, Inc.]], also established the London-based [[Writers and Readers Limited]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.duedil.com/company/02741303/writers-and-readers-limited "Writers and Readers Limited,"] DueDil.com Accessed Jan. 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992, to protect his own continuation of the series. These two publishers continued their series in several cases commissioning new authors to create alternate books to those being published by the other, leading to a number of examples where the two series were publishing two different books under the same title. The situation was eventually resolved in 1999 by the Icon series being rebranded as the ''Introducing...'' series, with titles starting with that word instead of ending "For Beginners".

Beginning in 2008, Icon's new titles and reissues played down the "Introducing..." to the level of a series name, and the titles were instead prominently subtitled "A Graphic Guide." In 2011, a second "Introducing..." series was launched with the subtitle "Practical Guides" focusing on topics within business, psychology and counselling.

==Reception==
Science writer [[Brian Clegg (writer)|Brian Clegg]], author of ''Introducing Infinity'' (2012) in the series, states that, "It is almost impossible to rate these relentlessly hip books - they are pure [[marmite]]," as the series, "puts across the message in a style that owes as much to [[Terry Gilliam]] and [[pop art]] as it does to [[popular science]]."&lt;ref name="PS01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Introducing Evolution: A Graphic Guide |first= |last= |url=http://www.popularscience.co.uk/reviews/rev633.htm |work=Popular Science |date= |accessdate=2017-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Lincoln Clem''' (August 13, 1851 – May 13, 1937) was a [[United States Army]] general who served as a [[Drummer boy (military)|drummer boy]] in the [[Union Army]] in the [[American Civil War]]. He gained fame for his bravery on the battlefield, becoming the youngest [[noncommissioned officer]] in Army history. He retired from the U.S. Army in 1915, having attained the rank of [[brigadier general]] in the Quartermaster Corps; he was the last [[veteran]] of the American Civil War still on duty in the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]]. By special act of Congress on August 29, 1916, he was promoted to [[Major general (United States)|major general]] one year after his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Keesee DM. 2001. '''Too Young to Die: Boy Soldiers of the Union Army 1861–1865'''. Blue Acron Press. Huntington, VA. {{ISBN|1-885033-28-1}}. pp. 224–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===American Civil War===
[[File:John Klem muster index card.jpg|thumb|upright|left|When enlisted, his name was spelled 'Klem']]
Born with the surname "Klem" in [[Newark, Ohio]] on August 13, 1851, he is said to have run away from home at age 10 in May 1861, after the death of his mother in a train accident, to become a Union Army drummer boy.&lt;ref name="On Point"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Ellen|title=Major General John Lincoln Clem|journal=On Point – The Journal of Army History|date=Fall 2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; First he attempted to enlist in the [[3rd Ohio Infantry]], but was rejected because of his age and small size. He then tried to join the [[22nd Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment|22nd Michigan]], which also refused him. He tagged along anyway and the 22nd eventually adopted him as mascot and drummer boy. Officers chipped in to pay him the regular soldier's wage of $13 a month and allowed him to officially enlist two years later. Research has shown that Clem's claims about the 3rd Ohio and running away from home in 1861 (rather than in either 1862 or 1863) may be fictitious.&lt;ref name="On Point" /&gt;

A popular legend suggests that Clem served as a drummer boy with the 22nd Michigan at the [[Battle of Shiloh]]. The legend suggests that he came very near to losing his life when a fragment from a shrapnel shell crashed through his drum, knocking him unconscious, and that subsequently his comrades who found and rescued him from the battlefield nicknamed Clem "Johnny Shiloh."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/08/08/104233143.pdf The New York Times, ''Last Veteran of '61 to Leave the Army,''] 8/8/1915. Retrieved June 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of historical evidence however suggests that Clem could not have taken part in the battle of Shiloh. The 22nd Michigan appears to be the first unit in which Clem served in any capacity, but this regiment had not yet been constituted at the time of the battle (mustering into service in August 1862 – four months after the Battle of Shiloh).&lt;ref name="On Point" /&gt; The Johnny Shiloh legend appears instead to stem from a popular Civil War song, "The Drummer Boy of Shiloh" by [[William S. Hays]] which was written for ''[[Harpers Weekly]]'' of New York. The song was written following the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] in September 1863, and may have been written with Clem in mind because he had already become a nationally-known figure by that time.

Regardless of his entry into service, Clem served as a drummer boy for the 22nd Michigan at the Battle of Chickamauga. He is said to have ridden an [[artillery]] caisson to the front and wielded a [[musket]] trimmed to his size. In the course of a Union retreat, he shot a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] colonel who had demanded his surrender. After the battle, the "Drummer Boy of Chickamauga" was promoted to [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]], the youngest soldier ever to be a [[noncommissioned officer]] in the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gacivilwar.org/story/john-lincoln-clem-an-american-legend "John Lincoln Clem,"] gacivilwar.org. Retrieved October 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secretary of the Treasury]], later [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court]], and fellow Ohioan, [[Salmon P. Chase]], decorated him for his heroics at Chickamauga. Clem's fame for the shooting is also open for debate, despite press reports supporting the story into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="On Point" /&gt; It is possible that he wounded Col. Calvin Walker, whose 3rd Tennessee opposed the 22nd Michigan towards the end of the battle.

[[File:John Clem - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Clem in 1867]]
In October 1863, Clem was captured in [[Georgia in the American Civil War|Georgia]] by Confederate [[cavalry]]men while detailed as a train guard. The Confederates confiscated his U.S. uniform which reportedly upset him terribly—including his cap which had three bullet holes in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gacivilwar.org/story/john-lincoln-clem-an-american-legend "John Lincoln Clem,"] gacivilwar.org. Retrieved September 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was included in a prisoner exchange a short time later, but the Confederate newspapers used his age and celebrity status for propaganda purposes, to show "what sore straits the Yankees are driven, when they have to send their babies out to fight us." After participating with the [[Army of the Cumberland]] in many other battles, serving as a mounted orderly, he was discharged in September 1864. Clem was wounded in combat twice during the war.

==Later life==
Clem graduated from high school in 1870. In 1871, he was elected commander/captain of the "Washington Rifles" a [[District of Columbia Army National Guard]] militia unit. After he attempted unsuccessfully to enter the [[United States Military Academy]], after failing the entrance exam, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] appointed him [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Twenty Fourth United States Infantry]] in December 1871. Clem was promoted to first lieutenant in 1874. Clem graduated from artillery school at [[Fort Monroe]] in 1875. He was promoted to captain in 1882 and transferred to the [[Quartermaster Corps|Quartermaster Department]] where he stayed for the rest of his career. He was promoted to major in 1895.

During the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898 he served as depot quartermaster in Portland, Oregon as well as department quartermaster for the Department of Columbia.  He then served in the occupation of [[Puerto Rico]] as depot and chief quartermaster in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].

Clem was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1901 and to colonel in 1903.  He then served from 1906 to 1911 as chief [[quartermaster]] at [[Fort Sam Houston]] in Texas.

[[File:John Lincoln Clem.jpg|thumb|left|Clem in 1922]] 
Clem reached the mandatory retirement age of 64 on August 13, 1915, when he was retired and promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]], as was customary for American Civil War veterans who retired at the rank of colonel. Clem was the last veteran of the American Civil War serving in the U.S. Army at the time of his retirement,&lt;ref name="On Point" /&gt; though another Civil War veteran, [[Peter Conover Hains]], re-entered the service in 1917. On August 29, 1916, Clem was promoted on the retired list to the rank of major general.&lt;ref&gt;Official Army Register, 1922. pg. 1211.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married Anita Rosetta French in 1875. After her death in 1899, he married Bessie Sullivan of San Antonio in 1903. Sullivan was the daughter of a Confederate veteran, leading Clem to claim that he was "the most united American" alive.&lt;ref name="On Point" /&gt; Clem was the father of three children. Clem was a companion of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]] and the [[Military Order of Foreign Wars]].

After retirement he lived in [[Washington, D.C.]] before returning to [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. He died in San Antonio on May 13, 1937, and was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in Arlington County, Virginia.

==Film portrayals==
In 1963, [[Walt Disney]] produced a made-for-TV film entitled ''[[Johnny Shiloh (film)|Johnny Shiloh]]'', with [[Kevin Corcoran]] in the title role. The film was telecast on the [[Disney anthology television series]]. The [[Sherman Brothers]] wrote the film's theme song; their 1968 movie musical score for ''[[The One and Only Genuine Original Family Band]]'' also included a song about him called "Drummin', Drummin', Drummin'," performed in the film by [[Walter Brennan]] who played an ex-Confederate soldier.

In 2007 Historical Productions released the movie Johnny "The True Story of a Civil War Legend" starring Cody Piper in the role of Johnny Lincoln (Shiloh) Clem. The movie is filmed in a documentary narrative way with many U.S. Civil War reenactments. The movie is filled with  information about what life was like as a Union soldier. By using actual photos, the viewer gains an understanding of the hardships caused by the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalproductionsinc.com/videos.html|title=HISTORICAL PRODUCTIONS Main Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKittrick’s research draws on the areas of black studies, anti-colonial studies, cultural geographies, and gender studies, and attends to the links between epistemological narratives and social justice. Creative texts she analyzed include music, music making, poetry, visual art, and literature, while specifically looking at the works of [[Sylvia Wynter]], [[Toni Morrison]], [[bell hooks]], Robbie McCauley, [[M. NourbeSe Philip]], [[Willie Bester]], [[Nas]], [[Octavia Butler]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Dionne Brand]] and [[Michael Jackson]].

McKittrick's 2014 article, "Mathematics Black Life" argues that since the presence of blackness in the colonial archive is conditioned by slavery, black death and anti-black violence, subsequent scholarly analyses of these histories often "repeat and cherish anti-black violence and black death."&lt;ref name=Mathematics18&gt;Katherine McKittrick, "Mathematics Black Life", in ''The Black Scholar'' 44, no. 2 (Summer 2014), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; McKittrick argues further, "If the source of blackness is death and violence, the citation of blackness—the scholarly stories we tell—calls for the repetition of death and violence. The practice of taking away life is followed by the sourcing and citation of racial-sexual death and racial-sexual violence and blackness is (always already and only) cast inside the mathematics of unlivingness (data/scientifically proven/certified violation/asterisk) where black comes to be (a bit)."&lt;ref name=Mathematics18 /&gt; According to McKittrick, to be committed to a decolonial logic that undoes and resists anti-black violence rather than reproduces it, black studies scholars must read the archive differently. This alternate reading aims to uncover instances of black freedom within the transatlantic archive as inherent to the mathematics of anti-black violence, or  "as possibilities that are iterations of black life that cannot be contained by black death."&lt;ref&gt;McKittrick, "Mathematics Black Life" (2014), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; McKittrick offers an example of this kind of alternative citational practice throughout the essay, as she persistently emphasizes and returns to the plight of an unnamed, formerly enslaved woman who, as recorded in ''[[The Book of Negroes]]'', claims she was "born free at Newtown, Long Island."&lt;ref&gt;McKittrick, "Mathematics Black Life" (2014), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; For McKittrick, this ex-slave's claim to freedom offers an opportunity for scholars to "trust the lies" that exist in the archive of slavery in order to locate and dwell on instances of black freedom.

'''Krste Petkov Misirkov''' ({{lang-bg|Кръстьо Петков Мисирков}}; {{lang-mk|Крсте Петков Мисирков}}) (18 November 1874, Postol, Ottoman Empire – 26 July 1926, [[Sofia]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]]) was a [[philologist]], [[slavist]], [[historian]] and [[ethnographer]]. In the period between 1903 and 1907 he published a book and a scientific magazine in which he affirmed the existence of a [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] [[national identity]] separate from other Balkan nations, and attempted to [[Codification (linguistics)|codify]] a [[Standard Macedonian|Standard Macedonian language]] based on the central [[Western Macedonian dialects]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ppbuavUZKEwC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=Za+makedonskite+raboti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XVQjUai1JaOq4ATqnYDIBw&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Za%20makedonskite%20raboti&amp;f=false Who are the Macedonians?], Hugh Poulton, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JFohARk4i-AC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=Krste+Misirkov%2BMacedonian+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0iO-T-vNBYqG4gSti8Ez&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Krste%20Misirkov%2BMacedonian%20language&amp;f=false Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation, John Shea, p. 204]: ''"After the failure of the Ilinden rebellion, Misirkov returned to St. Petersburg, and in 1905 he launched the journal Vardar in Macedonian."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.misirkov.org/predgovor.htm On the Macedonian Matters, Misirkov, 1903] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204131931/http://www.misirkov.org/predgovor.htm |date=4 February 2012 }}: ''"iас и іе написаф на централното македонцко наречіе, коіе за мене от сега на тамо имат да бидит литературен македонцки iазик."''&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] found Misirkov to be "the most significant Macedonian of the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;[http://star.dnevnik.com.mk/default.aspx?pBroj=1884&amp;stID=4305 http://star.dnevnik.com.mk/default.aspx?pBroj=1884&amp;stID=4305 Македонија мора да го има Крсте Мисирков во своите пазуви] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921044434/http://star.dnevnik.com.mk/default.aspx?pBroj=1884&amp;stID=4305 |date=21 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his efforts to codify a standard Macedonian language, he is often considered "the founder of the modern Macedonian literary language".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmesOn_HhfEC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=On+the+Macedonian+matters&amp;hl=mk&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qFIjUdiiDIb24QTis4GwAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=On%20the%20Macedonian%20matters&amp;f=false The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World, Loring M. Danforth, p. 50.]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1907 he began publishing predominantly articles, written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective. Misirkov reverted to Macedonian nationalism for a short in 1919. During the 1920s his views changed again, and he encouraged the Macedonian Slavs to adopt a Bulgarian national identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6RveDmHbIv8C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=He+even+conceded,+implicitly,+that+Macedonian+Slavs+might+have+become+Bulgarians,&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lN0kUZ2zItGOswbFrYDQDA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=He%20even%20conceded%2C%20implicitly%2C%20that%20Macedonian%20Slavs%20might%20have%20become%20Bulgarians%2C&amp;f=false Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag Münster, 2008], {{ISBN|3825813878}}, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xoww453NVQMC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=misirkov+end+bulgarian&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4MokUZz_LYXJ4ATWnYDACA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=misirkov%20end%20bulgarian&amp;f=false Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian Question, Victor Roudometof, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002], {{ISBN|0275976483}}, pp. 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EnEFNOcYIrUC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=misirkov++bulgarian+life&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ac0kUc-sFaKA4gT60YC4Ag&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=misirkov%20%20bulgarian%20life&amp;f=false When Languages Collide: Perspectives on Language Conflict, Compe and Coexistence, Brian D.

While Misirkov's work and personality remain highly controversial and disputed, there have been attempts among international scholars to reconcile the conflicting and self-contradictory statements made by Misirkov. According to Croatian [[Ivo Banac]], professor of history at [[Yale University]] Misirkov viewed both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians, and espoused pan-Bulgarian patriotism in a larger Balkan context, and especially with regard to Serbian and Greek hegemonism in Macedonia. However, in the context of the larger Bulgarian unit/nation, Misirkov sought both cultural and national differentiation from the Bulgarians and called both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia Macedonians.&lt;ref&gt;The national question in Yugoslavia: origins, history, politics, [[Ivo Banac]], Cornell University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-8014-9493-1}}, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early years ===
Krste Petkov Misirkov was born on 18 November 1874 in the village of [[Pella (modern)|Postol]] in the [[Salonica Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (present-day [[Greece]]). He started his elementary education in the local [[Greek language|Greek]] school, where he was studying until the sixth grade elementary school, but the bad financial situation of his family could not support his further education at that point and he left the school. At that period Serbian propaganda began to promote its variant of "[[Macedonism]]" and to recruit young people in order to "Serbianize" them.&lt;ref name="misirkov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.misirkov.org/biography.htm |title=Biography of Krste Petkov Misirkov |accessdate=6 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212085140/http://www.misirkov.org/biography.htm |archivedate=12 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Who Are the Macedonians? Hugh Poulton, C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 2000, {{ISBN|1850655340}}, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Chris Kostov, Peter Lang, 2010, {{ISBN|3034301960}}, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; After some period, Misirkov applied and was granted a scholarship by the [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian]] association "St. Sava".&lt;ref name="Георги"&gt;''Literature of the Macedonian language, Georgi Stalev, Skopje''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misirkov in Serbia ===
Misirkov spent some time in Serbia, where he was studying in [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and soon after he realized that the propaganda was the main goal of the Serbian association.&lt;ref name="misirkov"/&gt; The politics practiced by the association forced Misirkov and the other Macedonian students to participate in a student's revolt against the [[Saint Sava society]]. As a result of that, Misirkov and other companions moved from [[Belgrade]] to [[Sofia]]. Since he faced up with similar situation in Bulgaria, i.e., another propaganda,&lt;ref name="misirkov"/&gt; Misirkov again went to Serbia to continue his education, but without any success because he was rejected by the "St. Sava" association. Since he was willing to get higher education, he was forced, by a chain of events, to enroll a theological school for teachers. Similar to the association "St. Sava", this school as well had its own propagandistic goals and that resulted in another revolt of the students.&lt;ref&gt;"Кръсте Мисирков и за българските работи в Македония", Проф. д-р Веселин Трайков,  Знание ЕООД, 2000,  {{ISBN|954621177X}}, [http://www.promacedonia.org/bugarash/misirkov/misirkov.html p. 12.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of it, the school stopped working and the students were sent throughout Serbia. Misirkov was sent to [[Šabac]], where he finished the last, fourth, class of secondary education, but this time in the local gymnasium.&lt;ref name="Георги" /&gt; In both, Serbia and Bulgaria, Misirkov and his friend were treated as Serbs or Bulgarians&lt;ref name="misirkov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Георги"/&gt; in order to be accepted in the educational system. After the gymnasium, even though he graduated, Misirkov enrolled in another secondary school for teachers in Belgrade, where he graduated in 1895. During this time, particularly in 1893, Misirkov founded an association of students called "Vardar". Its charter included, among other things, the aim of studying and spreading a knowledge of their country as regards its geographical, ethnographic and historical aspects and the cardinal principle of its program was that Macedonia should belong to the Macedonians.&lt;ref name="misirkov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Георги" /&gt; In other words, the students were not satisfied by the [[Serbianization]] of the Macedonians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/ag/ag_2_2.html Антони Гиза, Балканските държави и македонския  въпрос]&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was inspired by the "[[Young Macedonian Literary Society|Lozari]]".&lt;ref name="Георги" /&gt; However, the Serbs were opposed to this thesis of the young students, so their society did not last very long and it was disbanded in 1895.&lt;ref name="misirkov"/&gt; Afterwards he was appointed as a Serbian teacher in [[Pristina]]. Misirkov refused and left for [[Odessa]] to continue his studies.

=== Misirkov in the Russian Empire ===
His educational qualifications obtained in Belgrade were not recognized in [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. Misirkov had to study from the very beginning in the Seminary at [[Poltava]]. In 1897 he was able to enter the [[Petersburg University]]. Here he entered at first the Bulgarian Students Association. About that part of his life, Misirkov writes in the article "School and socialism"&lt;ref&gt;Мир, XXXI, бр. 7476 от 26 май 1925&lt;/ref&gt; - ''In 1897 I went to Petrograd University and for five years was among the Bulgarian studentship as Bulgarian and member of the Bulgarian Student Society''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/bugarash/misirkov/misirkov.html Проф. д-р Веселин Трайков  - "Кръсте П. Мисирков и за българските работи в Македония", София, 2000, Издателство "Знание" ]&lt;/ref&gt; Misirkov carried out here his first scholarly lecture on the ethnography and history of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] before the members of the [[Russian Geographical Society|Russian Imperial Geographical Society]].

On November 15, 1900, when Misirkov third year student in the Faculty of History and Philosophy, along with other students in Russia created а Petersburg circle. The main objective of the circle is political autonomy of the population of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace (region)|Thrace]], declared by IMARO implemented and guaranteed by the [[Great Powers]]. In a letter sent to the President of the [[Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee]] on November 28, circle founders state that '' there's no Bulgarian who is not interested in the situation and fate of that part of our homeland, which continue to groan under the yoke of the tyrant''. At that time Misirkov still considers the Slavic population of Macedonia and Thrace as Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/bugarash/misirkov/otmisirkov.html НБКМ-БИА, ф. 224, Върховен македоно-одрински комитет, София, а.е. 23, л. 397 За (SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library-Bulgarian historical archive, facsimile 224, Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee, Sofia, а.е 23, sheet 397 3a)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901,  he moved to the [[University of Odessa]]. Of great importance to Misirkov was the founding of the [[Macedonian Scientific and Literary Society]] in Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;''The Balkan states and the Macedonian question'', prof. Antony Giza&lt;/ref&gt; Its creation was influenced by the Macedonian Club founded in Belgrade. After the Club was closed, its chief founders left for the Russian capital, where they organized the new Macedonian Society. This foundation in 1902 became the most important Macedonian institution abroad. In the same year this Society sent a special Memorandum to the [[Great Powers]], in which the [[Macedonian Question]] was examined from the national point of view. It was proposed also Macedonian literary language to be codified. The question was also examined of establishing a Macedonian Church under the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church|Ohrid Archbishopric]]. The aim of this Memorandum was that the Macedonians should be recognized as a separate nation and that Macedonia should be granted full autonomy within the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During this time he also examined the medieval period in Macedonia and his works contributed to the understanding of the 14th-century local ruler [[Krali Marko]].

Later Misirkov abandoned the University and left for [[Ottoman Vardar Macedonia|Ottoman Macedonia]].

=== Returning to the Ottoman Macedonia ===
Facing financial obstacles to continue his postgraduate education, he accepted the proposal of the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] to be appointed teacher in a high school in Bitola. There he became friendly with the Russian consul in [[Bitola]]. He began to plan opening of local schools and publishing textbooks in Macedonian language.&lt;ref name="misirkov"/&gt; But the [[Ilinden Uprising]] in 1903 and the assassination of the Russian Consul changed his plans and he returned to Russia. There Misirkov published different articles about the Ilinden Uprising and the reasons why the Consul was assassinated. Soon afterwards he wrote the brochure  "The Macedonian matters" and published it in Sofia. This book, was written in the Central Macedonian dialect,&lt;ref&gt;The Former Yugoslavia's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook, Matjaž Klemenčič,Mitja Žagar, p. 74: ''This work on the Macedonian language was written in Central Macedonian dialect, which he also recommended as a basis for a future literary language''&lt;/ref&gt; and Misirkov attacked in his writings the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]], the [[Ilinden Uprising]] and the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] (IMARO) as Bulgarian creations. As result, he was persecuted by IMARO, and it is believed its members destroyed a lot of copies of his book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1jSg3lxgSy8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=misirkov+controversy&amp;hl=bg#v=onepage&amp;q=misirkov%20controversy&amp;f=false Historical dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009], {{ISBN|0-8108-5565-8}}, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he says that [[Dame Gruev]], [[Gotse Delchev]], [[Boris Sarafov]] and other IMRO members are Macedonian national separatists.&lt;ref&gt;"They also began to persecute the Macedonian separatists. One of those who made his escape at this time was Dame Gruev, who was one of the Macedonian students who had moved from Belgrade to Sofia, and was also one of the separatists. Since they could not find favorable ground for their national separatist activity in Bulgaria, the Macedonians who had moved from Belgrade to Sofia turned to organizing revolutionary bodies in Bulgaria and Macedonia. The celebrated Macedonian revolutionary separatists, such as Gotse Delchev, were simply the pupils of the first generation of Macedonians who had studied in Serbia and Bulgaria. So, too, Sarafov and the revolutionaries who followed were simply the successors and heirs of these first revolutionaries but not the founders of the revolutionary organization."

=== Again in the Russian Empire ===

In 1905 he left for [[Berdiansk]] in Southern Russia. There he resumed publication of the journal "Vardar" and worked as Bulgarian teacher.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Георги Маргаритов.

Стр. 389–390&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April 1907 Misirkov began to cooperate with the issued in Sofia magazine ''Macedonian-Adrianople Review'', edited by [[Nikola Naumov]], which was ''de facto'' organ of the IMARO. On 24 April 1909 K. Missirkov printed in Odessa in a separate booklet his work "South Slavic epic legends of the marriage of King Volkashin in connection with the question of the reasons for the popularity of [[Krali Marko]] among the South Slavs". On 1 October 1909 he printed the article, "The foundations of a Serbian-Bulgarian rapprochement" in the Magazine "Bulgarian collection" edited by Bulgarian diplomats in St. Petersburg. By the time, a Slavic Festival was held in Sofia in 1910 and Missirkov was attend as its guest of honor. In 1910–1911, he translated from Bulgarian to Russian the book of the Bulgarian geographer Prof. [[Atanas Ishirkov]] "Bulgaria".

When the [[First Balkan war]] was declared, Misirkov went to Macedonia as a Russian war correspondent. There he could follow the military operations of the [[Bulgarian Army]]. Misirkov published a series of articles in the Russian press and some articles demanding that the Ottomans should be driven out of Macedonia. In 1913 after the outbreak of the [[Second Balkan war]] Misirkov went back to Russia, where he worked as a teacher also in the Bulgarian schools in Odessa.&lt;ref name="Трайков 2000"/&gt; Here he wrote his diary, which was found in 2006. Later he was appointed teacher of the Bulgarian school at [[Kishinev]]. While working as a teacher in Kishinev, Misirkov sent а letter to the Bulgarian academic [[Aleksandar Teodorov-Balan]] with a request to be assigned as a professor at [[Sofia University]]. That request clearly indicates his self-identification at that time - ''As a Bulgarian, I would willingly return to Bulgaria, if there is a need of a scientific research of the fate of the Bulgarian lands, especially Macedonia.''. A shorter letter with similar content was sent to another professor at Sofia University - [[Vasil Zlatarski]] with the request to be assigned as a chosen ''at the newly established department for history of Macedonia and the other western Bulgarian lands''.&lt;ref&gt;K. P. Misirkov - Diary 5 July to 30 August 1913, Sofia-Skopje, 2008, Published by State Agency "Archives" of the Republic of Bulgaria &amp; State Archive of the Republic of Macedonia, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

At that point, Misirkov made contacts with the [[Macedonian Scientific and Literary Society]], which started publishing the magazine "Macedonian Voice" in Russian. Misirkov was publishing in this magazine for some period under the pseudonym "K. Pelski".&lt;ref name="Георги" /&gt;

After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 [[Bessarabia]] became a [[Moldavian Democratic Republic|democratic republic]], and he was elected a member of the local parliament [[Sfatul Ţării]] as a representative of the [[Bessarabian Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[Minority group#Political|minority]]. At the same time, Misirkov worked as a secretary in the Bulgarian educational commission in Bessarabia.&lt;ref name="Трайков 2000"/&gt; In March 1918 was declared the [[union of Bessarabia with Romania]]. On May 21, 1918 Misirkov openеd a Bulgarian language course in [[Bolhrad]]. Then he took a secret trip to Bulgaria in order to procure textbooks for the students, but after his return in November he was arrested by the [[Kingdom of Romania]] authorities, still at war with Bulgaria; afterwards, he was extradited to Bulgaria.

=== Last years in Bulgaria ===
Еxpelled by the Romanian authorities, at the end of 1918 Misirkov returned to Sofia, where he spent one year as a head of the Historical department of the National Museum of Ethnography. Then, he worked as a teacher and director of the high schools in [[Karlovo]] and [[Koprivshtitsa]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Трайков 2000"/&gt; During this period (but before 1923) the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) apparently marked Misirkov as harmful to its cause and supposedly considering his assassination, but reconsidered after he met with a representative of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/bugarash/misirkov/zamisirkov.html Промемория на Никола Трайков за разговор с проф. Петко Стоянов за  Кръстю Мисирков, София, 8 март  1963 г].&lt;/ref&gt; He also resumed his journalistic activity and published many articles on the [[Macedonian Question]] in the Bulgarian press. Misirkov died in 1926 and was buried in the graveyards in Sofia with the financial support of 5000 levs from the Ministry of Education, as an honoured educator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/bugarash/misirkov/zamisirkov.html#4  ЦДИА, фонд № 177, Министерство на просвещението, опис № 2, а.е.230, л.22.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
In his life, Misirkov wrote one book, one diary, published one issue of a magazine and wrote more than thirty articles. His book "On Macedonian Matters" was published in Sofia in 1903. The magazine was called "Vardar" and was published in 1905 in Odessa, [[Russian Empire]]. The articles that Misirkov wrote have been published in different newspapers and they were focused on different topics. The book, magazine and a number of his article were written in the Central Macedonian dialects, which are basis of the Modern Macedonian.

==="On the Macedonian Matters"===
One of the most important work of Misirkov is the Macedonian book '' [[:File:За македонските работи- Крсте Петков Мисирков.pdf|On the Macedonian Matters]]'' (За македонцките работи, ''Za makedonckite raboti'') published in 1903 in Sofia, in which he laid down the principles of the modern Macedonian language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TRttHdXjP14C&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=manifesto%20on%20the%20macedonian%20matters&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Developing Cultural Identity in the Balkans: Convergence Vs Divergence, Raymond Detrez,Pieter Plas, p. 30]&lt;/ref&gt; This book was written in a Macedonian dialects from the area between Prilep and Bitola. It argued in favor of national separation, the establishment of autonomous national institutions within the [[Ottoman empire]], and the standardization of a distinct Macedonian language. Misirkov attacked both the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] and the [[Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]]  (IMARO) as agents of the Bulgarian interests in Macedonia.

According to this book, the Macedonian literary language should be based on dialects from the central part of Macedonia, which were used in the book itself. On the other hand, Misirkov appealed to the Ottoman authorities for eventual recognition of a separate Macedonian nation. He admitted there was not such one, and most of the Macedonian Slavs has called themselves Bulgarians, but it should be created, when the necessary historical circumstances would arise.&lt;ref&gt;''The term ‘project’ tackles likewise the specific temporal orientation of the initial stage of formation of Macedonian ethnic nationalism: the Macedonian self-determination is seen by Misirkov as a future ideal and his national manifesto On the Macedonian Matters (Sofia, 1903) recognizes the lack of actual correlation between the concept of Macedonian Slavic ethnicity and the real self-identifications of the majority of Macedonian Slavs. In a rather demiurgical way, Misirkov is the first who exposes the basic ‘ethnographic’ characteristics of what he regards as ‘inexistent’ but ‘possible’ and ‘necessary’ Macedonian Slavic ethnicity''... Tchavdar Marinov, "Between Political Autonomism and Ethnic Nationalism: Competing Constructions of Modern Macedonian National Ideology (1878-1913)", p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Misirkov lamented that "no local Macedonian patriotism" existed and would have to be created. He anticipated that Macedonians would respond to his proposal with a series of baffled questions: "What sort of new Macedonian nation can this be when we, and our fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers have always been called Bulgarians?...Macedonian as a nationality has never existed, and it does not exist now"... Misirkov answered by observing that national loyalties change with time: "What has not existed in the past may still be brought into existence later, provided that the appropriate historical circumstances arise... Misirkov in short wanted, the Ottoman state to promote Macedonian nation-building, calling for “official recognition".''

Krste Misirkov, the "first creator of a clear and rounded representation, of argued and systematic conception about the national essence of Macedonian people,"  brought arguments in favor of Macedonian "national separatism" in his On Macedonian matters, but still considered the Macedonian question a part of a larger Bulgarian complex, if for no other reason than linguistic. Misirkov's pan-Bulgarian patriotism was based largely on the kinship of language, and his pan-Bulgarian positions, which he used, moreover frontally, against the Serbs and Greeks.''The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics, Ivo Banac, Cornell University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0801494931}}, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Misirkov speaks, for instance, of the relations between "the Macedonian peoples" [makedonckite narodi], of the "convergence of interests of all Macedonian peoples." The term "nation" appears rarely and is contrasted to the term "nationality": e.g., Misirkov suggests that, in Macedonia, there are many "nationalities" [nacionalnosti], while "a distinct Macedonian Slavic nation [naciia]" does not yet exist (p. 46). This usage actually implies that the "nation" is seen as a political phenomenon of a "higher" degree, transcending a multiplicity of actual ethnic and/or confessional particularities.'' We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe, Diana Mishkova, European University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|9639776289}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pbi_wzu7QAMC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=misirkov+macedonian+identity&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwATgKahUKEwiz74uGmNvGAhUhc3IKHS_1DeU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 133.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Misirkov accepted that his project for Macedonian particularist nationalism broke with considerable Bulgarian sentiment. He admitted both that there was “no local Macedonian patriotism,”  and that ordinary Macedonians would see Macedonian particularism as a novelty: “What sort of new Macedonian nation can this be when we and our fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers have always been called Bulgarians?” Responding to these arguments, Misirkov showed a surprising acceptance that national communities evolve in response to events: “what has not existed in the past may still be brought into existence later, provided that the appropriate historical circumstances arise.”  Misirkov thus tried to create the appropriate historical circumstances.'' Sundry Macedonias, Alexander Mark Maxwell, University of Wisconsin--Madison, 1998, pp. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Many people will want to know what sort of national separatism we are concerned with; they will ask if we are not thinking of creating a new Macedonian nation. Such a thing would be artificial and short-lived. And, anyway? What sort of new Macedonian nation can this be when we, and our fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers have always been called Bulgarians?...One of the first questions which will be posed by the opponents of national unification and of the revival movement in Macedonia will be: what is the Macedonian Slav nation? Macedonian as a nationality has never existed, they will say, and it does not exist now.... The first objection — that a Macedonian Slav nationality has never existed — may be very simply answered as follows: what has not existed in the past may still be brought into existence later, provided that the appropriate historical circumstances arise...''[[Wikisource:On Macedonian Matters|On Macedonian Matters. (1903) by Krste Misirkov.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, Misirkov was persecuted and went back to Russia. Most copies of his book were confiscated or destroyed by the Bulgarian police and IMARO-activists, shortly after the book was published.&lt;ref name="lorring"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmesOn_HhfEC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=misirkov+standart+macedonian&amp;hl=bg&amp;ei=PMhCTdiOFo_rOYb82bcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World, Loring M. Danforth, Editor: Princeton University Press, 1997, ISBN 0-691-04356-6,p. 64.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of that at his own time, the book had little or no impact and did not become popular until the middle of the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6RveDmHbIv8C&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=misirkov+controversy&amp;hl=bg#v=onepage&amp;q=misirkov%20&amp;f=false Region, regional identity and regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag Münster, 2008], {{ISBN|3-8258-1387-8}}, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Then it was rediscovered by the Macedonian linguist [[Blaze Koneski]] in Sofia, and its content was popularized.

According some researchers Misirkov's principles played a crucial role in the future codification of the Macedonian language, right after World War II, while others like [[Loring Danforth]] and John Shea consider that ''the language planners involved in the codification of standard literary Macedonian in 1944, were working in complete ignorance of Misirkov's work''.&lt;ref&gt;Loring M. Danforth - The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greece p. 205"&gt;John Shea - Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; John Shea alone states that Misirkov's book was lost and the process of standardization of the Macedonian language had to start all over again in 1944, as well as that ''Misirkov's book was actually written Macedonian Standard language which was finally codified in 1944/1945.''&lt;ref name="Greece p. 205"/&gt;

After the Second World War Misirkovs book will be permanently cited by the historians in Macedonia as an indication of the existence of a separate Macedonian ethnicity at his time. However, only two years later Misirkov changed his stance, and published a series of articles in the IMARO press written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0810862956}}, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming Bulgarian identity for himself and the Macedonian Slavs.&lt;ref&gt;''Misirkovs book will be widely cited in the 20th and the 21th centuries by all historians in the R. Macedonia as a clear indication of the existence of a separate Macedonian ethnicity. However, they ignored the fact that Misirkov abandoned his ideas and in 1910 in the Bulgarian Almanac, as well as in his memoirs, he clearly indicated his Bulgarian ethnic identity.'' Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Chris Kostov, Peter Lang, 2010, {{ISBN|3034301960}}, pp. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The eminent Macedonian literary historian Blazhe Ristovski’s History of the Macedonian Nation describes the “awakening” and formation of the Macedonian nation by various intellectuals in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Ristovski aims to prove the Macedonian nature of writers, poets, and other intellectuals who can be said to have been champions of the Macedonian cause. If these persons declared themselves, at one time or another, “Bulgarians,” then Ristovski goes to great length to point out that they cannot have meant it quite like that. For example, in the case of Krste Misirkov – “the most eminent, most significant and most versatile Macedonian cultural and national worker before liberation”– Ristovksi states that Misirkov’s support for the annexation of Macedonia by Bulgaria did not reflect “his genuine beliefs and sentiments” but was “dictated by the conditions of the time.”'' Serving the Nation: Historiography in the Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) After Socialism, Historein, vol. 4 (2003-4) Ulf Brunnbauer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The key fact about Macedonian nationalism is that it is new: in the early twentieth century, Macedonian villagers defined their identity religiously—they were either "Bulgarian," "Serbian," or "Greek" depending on the affiliation of the village priest.

Of those Slavs who had developed some sense of national identity, the majority probably considered themselves to be Bulgarians, although they were aware of differences between themselves and the inhabitants of Bulgaria... The question as of whether a Macedonian nation actually existed in the 1940s when a Communist Yugoslavia decided to recognize one is difficult to answer. Some observers argue that even at this time it was doubtful whether the Slavs from Macedonia considered themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians."

===The magazine "Vardar"===
Besides ''On Macedonian Matters'', Misirkov is author of the first scientific magazine on Macedonian language. The [[:File:Списание „Вардар“.pdf|magazine ''Vardar'']] was published in 1905 in Odessa, Russian Empire. The magazine was published only once, because of the financial problems that Misirkov had been facing with at that time. "Vardar" has been published on Macedonian language, and the orthography that has been used is almost same as the orthography of the standard Macedonian language.&lt;ref&gt;''p.13, "Vardar", Blaže Ristovski, Institute of Macedonian language "Krste Misirkov", Skopje, 1966.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine was meant to include several different scientific disciplines, mostly concerned with Macedonia. The first section of the magazine is made of the introduction, where in general Misirkov elaborates the aims of the magazine and this section was in Macedonian and Russian. The next section of the magazine is the literary section, where Misirkov translated into Macedonian the poem "Traveler" by the Croatian poet P. Preradovic. After the literary section, the magazine includes an analysis about the Balkan propagandas in Macedonia, followed by a political analysis of some of the global events in that period. The last section is statistics, which shows the Macedonian population in Macedonia.

The goals of the magazine were to:
# Establish a relationship between the Macedonian national separatists and their opponents, all Balkan people interested in the Macedonian question;
# Fight for separate Slavic Macedonian nationality;
# Show that the language is individual, it's not Serbian nor Bulgarian and is capable of literary development.

Regarding the opponents of the magazine, Misirkov shares his concern that ''at the end, the larger, if not to say the largest, part of the Macedonian intelligentsia would be against "Vardar" and its program, because all Macedonian, opponents of the Macedonian national separatism, are convinced, that with money in Macedonia a man can create out of our Macedonians not only Bulgarian, Serb, Greek or Macedonian, but even Gypsy nationality''. He also believes that the ''common people will (also) be against Vardar and his associates, the national separatists, because the idea of the separatists, is hard to be understood by the common people, which is faced up with different kinds of prechments and new ideas'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mk.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%E2%80%9E%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%E2%80%9C_(%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81)/_%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80 Magazine "Vardar", p. 1-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Articles ===
[[File:Krushevo - Macedonium - P1100265.JPG|thumb|Misirkov's ''Macedonian Affairs'' commemorated as one of the key points of Macedonia's history, at the [[Makedonium]] memorial in [[Kruševo]]]]
During his life, Misirkov published many articles for different newspapers and magazines. The articles deal with Macedonia, Macedonian culture, ethnology, politics and nation on one hand and with the Bulgarian nation, politics and ethnography on the other. Misirkov published his articles in Macedonian, Russian and Bulgarian and he published them either in Russia or in Bulgaria. Most of the articles were signed by his birth name, but there are articles that are signed with his pseudonym ''K. Pelski''.

=== Diary ===
In 2006, a handwritten diary by Misirkov written during his stay in Russia in 1913 was discovered. It was declared authentic by Bulgarian and Macedonian experts and was published in 2008.&lt;ref name="diary"&gt;[http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n104246 FOCUS Information Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the diary clearly shows that at the time, Misirkov was a Bulgarian nationalist. It has given rise to new public discussion over Misirkov's stances on Bulgarian and Macedonian ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.netinfo.bg/?tid=40&amp;oid=995281 Нетинфо – Как "бащата на македонизма" Кръстьо Мисирков се оказа чист българин]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=92522 Diary Reveals Father of Macedonian Nation Had Bulgarian Identity, Sofia News Agency, 23 April 2008, Wednesday]&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript, includes 381 pages written in Russian language. Misirkov wrote it in [[Kotovsk, Ukraine|Kotovsk]]'s nearby village of Klimentove, where he lived and worked at the time. It contains also articles and excerpts from the Russian press of that time.

=== Contribution to Bulgarian dialectology and ethnography ===
In several publications Misirkov made an attempt to determine the border between the [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Bulgarian language]], including in the [[Bulgarian dialects|Bulgarian dialect area]] nearly all of [[Torlak dialect|Torlakian]] and [[Macedonian dialects]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Мисирков, Кръстьо (1898).

==Controversies about Misirkov's ethnicity and views==
During the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century the idea of a separate Macedonian ethnicity was as yet promoted only by some circles of intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uOPUnWM8RAYC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=The+Macedonian+national+awakening&amp;lr=&amp;hl=bg#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Macedonian%20national%20awakening&amp;f=false The Macedonian Question: Britain and the Southern Balkans 1939–1949, Dimitris Livanios, Oxford University Press US, 2008] {{ISBN|0-19-923768-9}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, most of the Slavic people in Macedonia considered themselves Bulgarian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/pdf/cedime-se-bulgaria-macedonians.PDF Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe, Southeast Europe (CEDIME-SE) – "Macedonians of Bulgaria"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;154 Studia Theologica V, 3/2007, 147 – 176 Alexander Maxwell, Krste Misirkov's call for Macedonian Autocephaly: religious nationalism as instrumental political tactic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krste Misirkov, ''On the Macedonian Matters'' (''Za Makedonckite Raboti''), Sofia, 1903: "And, anyway, what sort of new Macedonian nation can this be when we and our fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers have always been called Bulgarians?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sperling | first1 = James | last2 = Kay | first2 = Sean | last3 = Papacosma | first3 = S.

===View of Misirkov in Bulgaria===
In Bulgaria, Misirkov is regarded as a controversial educator with scientific contribution to Bulgarian dialectology and ethnography. He graduated from the [[Belgrade University]] as a student of Prof. [[Stojan Novaković]] and was influenced by his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Църнушанов, Коста. Македонизмът и съпротивата на Македония срещу него. Унив. изд. "Св. Климент Охридски", София, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Novaković was a prominent proponent of the [[Macedonism]], thereby promoting Serbian interests in the region of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;"Since the Bulgarian idea, as it is well-known, is deeply rooted in Macedonia, I think it is almost impossible to shake it completely by opposing it merely with the Serbian idea. This idea, we fear, would be incapable, as opposition pure and simple, of suppressing the Bulgarian idea. That is why the Serbian idea will need an ally that could stand in direct opposition to Bulgarianism and would contain in itself the elements which could attract the people and their feelings and thus sever them from Bulgarianism. This ally I see in Macedonism...." from the report of S. Novakovic to the Minister of Education in Belgrade about "Macedonism" as a transitional stage in Serbianization of the Macedonian Bulgarians; see idem. Cultural and Public Relations of the Macedonians with Serbia in the XIXth c.), Skopje, 1960, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards Misirkov met several times with him and Novaković's diplomatic activity in St. Petersburg played significant role for the foundation of the [[Macedonian Scientific and Literary Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Novaković initiated the establishment of closer Serbian-Russian relations as consul in St. Petersburg, where he supported the local macedonists as Misirkov and Chupovski, see: Angel G. Angelov, ''The European Legacy: Toward New Paradigms'', 1470-1316, Volume 2, Issue 3, 1997, Pages 411 – 417. and the Memoirs of Hristo Shaldev, Macedonian revolutionary (1876–1962), Macedonian Patriotic Organization "TA" (Adelaide, Australia, 1993), The Slav Macedonian Student Society in St. Petersburg, pp. 14–21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after 1906 Misirkov rejected these ideas,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xoww453NVQMC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=misirkov+bulgarian+idea&amp;hl=bg&amp;ei=94pXTcyTNcvt4gao1MjVBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=misirkov%20bulgarian%20idea&amp;f=false Collective memory, national identity, and ethnic conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian question, Victor Roudometof, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002], {{ISBN|0-275-97648-3}}, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; opposng the Serbian theory about the "floating mass" of the "Macedonian Slavs"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6RveDmHbIv8C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=misirkov+bulgarianism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=49RWTavnGYOp8QPBzs26DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=misirkov%20bulgarianism&amp;f=false Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, Publisher LIT Verlag Münster, 2009], {{ISBN|3-8258-1387-8}}, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krste Misirkov wrotе in "Bulgarska Sbirka" – 'Bulgarian Collection' magazine, 1910–1911: "The readers of the present article will be probably surprised by the enormous controversy they encounter here when they compare the contents with what they have read or may read in my brochure On the Macedonian Matters. In order to make sense out of this controversy, they must be reminded that I acted there like an mprovised politician vis-a-vis the Macedonian Question... The entire contents of the brochure was so far from unbiased scholarship! ...The idea of a separate Macedonian nation is a lie, cunningly tailored so that the Serbs can have a right to at least a part of Macedonia."&lt;/ref&gt; and even developed a kind of ''[[Serbophobia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Мисирков има и некои  чисто расистички ставови за Србите. Вели, дека тие биле “шумадински овчари”. Дека Србија била заснована од “свинскиот трговец Караѓорѓе”, дека истава Србија била “единствен виновник за ропството на македонските Бугари”. Зборува за некаква карактеристичка црта на “српските овчари – цареубијци”. Вели дека Србите поробиле “вековната бугарска култура во Македонија”. Како илустрација се даваат писмата на Мисирков до министерот за надворешни работи на Русија, каде што се апелира „македонските Бугари“ да се оттргнат од јаремот на „шумадиските свињари“, а поентира со тоа дека „никогаш нема да престанеме да се чувствуваме Македонци или што е едно те исто – македонски Бугари“.&lt;/ref&gt; In this period he became evidently [[Bulgarophiles|bulgarophile]] and argued that the Slavic population of Macedonia was not "a formless paste" but a "well baked Bulgarian bread",&lt;ref&gt;Македонизмът и съпротивата на

Later in 1913, in his diary from the Balkan wars, he explicitly identifies himself as [[Macedonian Bulgarian]]. Bulgarian historians believe that his writings were significantly altered by the post-WWII Yugoslavian Communist regime to support the notion of a "Macedonian nation", distinct from the Bulgarian one.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarians also note that Misirkov worked as a Bulgarian teacher in Russia, was Bulgarian deputy in [[Bessarabia]], chose Bulgarian citizenship, lived and died in Bulgaria and worked there until his death in 1926. Nevertheless, Bulgarian scholarship points out that despite Misirkov in many cases defending the cause of [[Bulgarian nationalism]], he several times switched during the 1920s, from Bulgarian to Macedonian one, and vice a versa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pbi_wzu7QAMC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=misirkov+bulgarian+nationalist&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1OpWTbrPJsuYOriUuf4E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=misirkov%20bulgarian%20nationalist&amp;f=false We, the people: politics of national peculiarity in Southeastern Europe, Diana Mishkova, Central European University Press, 2009], {{ISBN|963-9776-28-9}}, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bulgarian observers, after the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] also have arisen polemics about the identity of Misirkov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macedoniainfo.com/Misirkov.htm Сто години Илинден или сто години Мисирков?

Неизвестният досега дневник на Мисирков разбуни духовете край Вардара, Светослав Делчев.&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular Misirkov's thought in Bulgaria is:
&lt;center&gt;{{Quotation|Whether we call ourselves Bulgarians or Macedonians, we have always maintained a separate, unified and different from the Serbs ethnicity, with Bulgarian consciousness, which will entail the fight for the human rights of the Macedonian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/bugarash/misirkov/misirkovstatii2.html#16 Народността на македонците, К. Мисирков, в-к "20 Юлии", бр. 5, 11 Май 1924.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;

===View of Misirkov in the Republic of Macedonia===
In the [[Republic of Macedonia]], Misirkov is regarded as the most prominent [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] [[publicist]], [[philologist]] and [[linguistics|linguist]] who set the principles of the [[Macedonian language|Macedonian literary language]] in the early 20th century. In some of his writings he identifies the Macedonians as separate nation and the Macedonian as a separate [[South Slavic language]]. Also, Misirkov is the author of the first scientific magazine in Macedonian and because of his contributions to the Macedonian national cause, he is regarded as the greatest Macedonian of the 20th century. In his honor, many books and scientific works have been published and the [[Institute for Macedonian language "Krste Misirkov"]] is named after him.

There is not an important debate about Misirkov's ethnicity in Macedonia, since he is always regarded as Macedonian as it is obvious in most of his major writings. Since he was not allowed to live in work in Macedonia by the Yugoslav authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Misirkov molba.jpg|Misirkov's application for permanent residence in Macedonia.]]&lt;/ref&gt; unwillingly he remained in Bulgaria where he got Bulgarian citizenship since he needed it for his job. Regarding Misirkov's signature under the phrase "Macedonian Bulgarian", the Macedonian historians and linguists argue that it means nothing but a Macedonian person with a Bulgarian citizenship, in a political sense, or just a Macedonian person living in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a1.com.mk/vesti/default.aspx?VestID=73477 Експерти: Нема дилеми за идентитет на Мисирков] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010015807/http://www.a1.com.mk/vesti/default.aspx?VestID=73477 |date=10 October 2010 }} on a1.com.mk&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fact is that Misirkov gained Bulgarian citizenship after [[World War I]] (1915-1918)&lt;ref&gt;Заявление на Кр. Мисирков до председателя на народното събрание - София, 25 декември 1923 г. ЦДИА, ф. 173, оп. 3, а.е. 3817, л.л. 226-229.&lt;/ref&gt; and has declared as Bulgarian Macedonian in 1913, which is against the claims of the Macedonian historians and linguists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/bugarash/misirkov/otmisirkov.html Letter to the head of the National Geographic Museum (19.03 1919 г. #6784]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Мисирков, К. П. Дневник 2.VII - 30. VII.1913, София-Скопие,2008&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some Macedonian scholars, like PhD [[Vlado Popovski]], the academician [[Blaže Ristovski]] and others, say that Misirkov’s usage of the term “Macedonian Bulgarian” was only a tactic, because in 1914 and many times after that, he repeated his views about the Macedonian national existence.&lt;ref&gt;In 1914 Misirkov wrote: ''“…I’d use the words of [[Boris Sarafov]], that we, the Macedonians are neither Serbs nor Bulgarians, but simply Macedonians…”'' (”The Macedonian and the Bulgarian national ideals,” ''Macedonian voice'', No. 10, Sankt Peterburg, 1914, pg. 11-14.); Д-p Блaжe Pиcтoвcки, „Kpcтe Мисирков (1874–1926) - прилог кон проучувањето на развитокот на македонската национална мисла, [[Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts|МАNU]], Skopje, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most quoted and most popular Misirkov's thought in Macedonia is:

&lt;center&gt;{{Quotation|We are obliged to caress our language, because it is ours, just as much as our fatherland.&lt;ref&gt;''Misirkov, K. Few words about the Macedonian literary language,  On the Macedonian matters, Sogia, 1903, p. 135''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am Macedonian and the interests of my fatherland are: not Russia and Austria-Hungary are enemies of Macedonia, but Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;Misirkov, K. Preface, On the Macedonian matters, Sofia, 1903, p. VII&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;

{{Party politics}}
The '''left–right''' [[political spectrum]] is a system of classifying political positions, [[Ideology|ideologies]] and [[Political party|parties]], from equality on the left to [[social stratification|social hierarchy]] on the right. [[Left-wing politics]] and [[right-wing politics]] are often presented as opposed, although a particular individual or group may take a left-wing stance on one matter and a right-wing stance on another; and some stances may overlap and be considered either left- or right-wing depending on the ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milner|first=Helen|date=2004|title=Partisanship, Trade Policy, and Globalization: Is There a Left–Right Divide on Trade Policy|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hmilner/forthcoming%20papers/ISQ_milner_judkins2004.PDF|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00293.x|pmid=|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, where the terms originated, the Left has been called 'the party of movement' and the Right 'the party of order'.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp &amp; Wright, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Garfinkle, Telltale Hearts: The Origins and Impact of the Vietnam Antiwar Movement (1997).

== History of the terms ==
The terms "left" and "right" appeared during the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 when members of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] divided into supporters of the king to the president's right and supporters of the revolution to his left. One deputy, the Baron de Gauville, explained: "We began to recognize each other: those who were loyal to religion and the king took up positions to the right of the chair so as to avoid the shouts, oaths, and indecencies that enjoyed free rein in the opposing camp". However, the Right opposed the seating arrangement because they believed that deputies should support private or general interests but should not form factions or political parties. The contemporary press occasionally used the terms "left" and "right" to refer to the opposing sides.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

When the National Assembly was replaced in 1791 by a [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] comprising entirely new members, the divisions continued. "Innovators" sat on the left, "moderates" gathered in the centre, while the "conscientious defenders of the constitution" found themselves sitting on the right, where the defenders of the [[Ancien Régime]] had previously gathered.{{clarify|date=August 2017|reason=is "conscientious defenders of the constitution" Gauchet's phrase or does it come from a contemporary source?}} When the succeeding [[National Convention]] met in 1792, the seating arrangement continued, but following the [[coup d'état]] of 2 June 1793 and the arrest of the [[Girondins]] the right side of the assembly was deserted and any remaining members who had sat there moved to the centre. However, following the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] of 1794 the members of the far-left were excluded and the method of seating was abolished. The new constitution included rules for the assembly that would "break up the party groups".&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, pp. 245–47&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] in 1814–1815 political clubs were again formed. The majority [[Ultra-royalist|ultraroyalists]] chose to sit on the right. The "constitutionals" sat in the centre while independents sat on the left. The terms [[Far-right politics|extreme right]] and [[Far-left politics|extreme left]] as well as [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] and [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] came to be used to describe the nuances of ideology of different sections of the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, pp. 247–49&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "left" and "right" were not used to refer to [[political ideology]] per se, but only to seating in the legislature. After 1848, the main opposing camps were the "[[The Mountain (1849)|democratic socialists]]" and the "[[Reactionary|reactionaries]]" who used red and white flags to identify their party affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; With the establishment of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] in 1871, the terms were adopted by political parties: the Republican Left, the Centre Right and the Centre Left (1871) and the Extreme Left (1876) and Radical Left (1881). The beliefs of the group called the Radical Left were actually closer to the Centre Left than the beliefs of those called the Extreme Left.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Crapez, "De quand date le clivage gauche/droite en France?", Revue française de science politique, 48 (1), février 1998, pp. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the early twentieth century, the terms "left" and "right" came to be associated with specific political ideologies and were used to describe citizens' political beliefs, gradually replacing the terms "[[Red flag (politics)|reds]]" and "the reaction". Those on the Left often called themselves "[[Republicanism|republicans]]", while those on the Right often called themselves "[[Conservatism|conservatives]]". The words Left and Right were at first used by their opponents as slurs.

By 1914, the Left half of the legislature in France was composed of Unified Socialists, Republican Socialists and Socialist Radicals, while the parties that were called "Left" now sat on the right side. The use of the words Left and Right spread from France to other countries and came to be applied to a large number of political parties worldwide, which often differed in their political beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, pp. 255–259.&lt;/ref&gt; There was asymmetry in the use of the terms Left and Right by the opposing sides. The Right mostly denied that the left–right spectrum was meaningful because they saw it as artificial and damaging to unity. However, the Left, seeking to change society, promoted the distinction. As [[Émile Chartier|Alain]] observed in 1931: "When people ask me if the division between parties of the Right and parties of the Left, men of the Right and men of the Left, still makes sense, the first thing that comes to mind is that the person asking the question is certainly not a man of the Left".&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; In British politics, the terms "right" and "left" came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s in debates over the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain Between the Wars: 1918–1940'' (1955) p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish sociologist [[Robert M. MacIver]] noted in ''The Web of Government'' (1947):  &lt;blockquote&gt;The right is always the party sector associated with the interests of the upper or dominant classes, the left the sector expressive of the lower economic or social classes, and the centre that of the middle classes. Historically this criterion seems acceptable. The conservative right has defended entrenched prerogatives, privileges and powers; the left has attacked them. The right has been more favorable to the aristocratic position, to the hierarchy of birth or of wealth; the left has fought for the equalization of advantage or of opportunity, for the claims of the less advantaged. Defense and attack have met, under democratic conditions, not in the name of class but in the name of principle; but the opposing principles have broadly corresponded to the interests of the different classes.&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Ideological groupings across the spectrum ==
Generally, the left-wing is characterized by an emphasis on 'ideas such as [[Liberty|freedom]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], [[Fraternity (philosophy)|fraternity]], [[rights]], [[Social progress|progress]], [[reform]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]', while the right-wing is characterized by an emphasis on 'notions such as [[authority]], [[hierarchy]], [[Law and order (politics)|order]], [[duty]], [[tradition]], [[Reactionary|reaction]] and [[nationalism]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Heywood, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KYY-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119 Key Concepts in Politics and International Relations]'' (2d ed.: [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2015), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists and other analysts regard the left as including [[Anarchism|anarchists]],&lt;ref&gt;Clay Risen, "The Bill of the Century", passim, e.g. "Southern Democrats faced three choices: they could ditch their party for the Republicans; move to the left and hope to ride a wave of an expanding post-Jim Crow black electorate; or double down on segregation and white supremacy ..." p. 168, Bloomsbury Press, 2015, {{ISBN|978-1608198269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Frank H.

Historically, liberals and radicals have been internationalists ... Liberal intellectuals have fought for freedom of movement, freedom from censorship, and world cultural exchange, and have condemned ethnocentrism and prejudice.  Right-wing nationalists, on the other hand, have glorified the unique heritage of their own ethnic group. The right has fought foreign influences that would undermine their historic religion, language, customs, or politics.  But the description of the left as open and internationalist and the right as closed and nationalist is misleadingly simple.  Nationalism has always been the most popularly appealing element in right-wing doctrine. As such it has been seduced and been adopted by the left." *
* Anne Sa'adah, ''Contemporary France: A Democratic Education'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003): "The importance of nationalism as an opposition ideology is particularly clear in the record of the nineteenth century. For most of that century, nationalism was associated with the revolutionary rhetoric of popular sovereignty and used most effectively by the left, which was out of power.

While this slogan originally served to publicize the Green movement's efforts to find a distinct, third alternative to the growth consensus of capitalism and communism, it has since served to generate a lively and sometimes acrimonious debate within the Green movement concerning the proper political characterization of Green politics .... In particular, ecosocialists have mounted a challenge to the presumed left-right ideology neutrality of Green politics by pointing out the various egalitarian and redistributional (and hence 'leftist') measures that are needed to ensure an equitable transition toward a conserver society."&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists have observed that the ideologies of political parties can be mapped along a single left–right axis.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Klaus von Beyme]] categorized European parties into nine families, which described most parties. Beyme was able to arrange seven of them from left to right: [[Communism|communist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Green politics|green]], [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]], [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[far-right politics|right-wing extremist]]. The position of agrarian and regional/ethnic parties varied.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in the late 1980s on two bases, positions on ownership of the means of production and positions on social issues, confirmed this arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a tendency for party ideologies to persist and values and views that were present at a party's founding have survived. However, they have also adapted for [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] reasons, making them appear more similar.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] and [[Stein Rokkan]] observed that modern party systems are the product of social conflicts played out in the last few centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; They said that lines of cleavage had become "frozen".&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern [[Political party|political parties]] were liberals, organized by the [[middle class]] in the 19th century to protect them against the [[aristocracy]]. They were major political parties in that century, but declined in the twentieth century as first the [[working class]] came to support socialist parties and economic and [[social change]] eroded their middle class base.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative parties arose in opposition to liberals in order to defend aristocratic privilege, but in order to attract voters they became less doctrinaire than liberals. However, they were unsuccessful in most countries and generally have been able to achieve power only through cooperation with other parties.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialist parties were organized in order to achieve [[Labor rights|political rights for workers]] and were originally allied with liberals. However, they broke with the liberals when they sought [[Workers' control|worker control]] of the [[means of production]].&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 33–35&lt;/ref&gt; Christian democratic parties were organized by Catholics who saw liberalism as a threat to traditional values. Although established in the 19th century, they became a major political force following the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Communist parties emerged following a division within socialism first on support of the [[World War I|First World War]] and then support of the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Right-wing extremist parties are harder to define other than being more right-wing than other parties, but include [[fascism|fascists]] and some extreme conservative and nationalist parties.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Green parties were the most recent of the major party groups to develop. They have mostly rejected socialism and are very liberal on social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

These categories can be applied to many parties outside Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, pp. 44–47&lt;/ref&gt; Ware (1996) asserted that {{clarify |date=August 2017 |reason=needs be more specific than "[[Liberal]]" |text=in the United States both major parties were liberal,}} even though there are left–right policy differences between them.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in Western Europe ==
In the 2001 book ''The Government and Politics of France'', Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright say that the main factor dividing the left and right wings in Western Europe is class. The left seeks [[social justice]] through [[Redistribution of wealth|redistributive social and economic policies]], while the Right defends [[private property]] and [[capitalism]]. The nature of the conflict depends on existing social and political cleavages and on the level of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp &amp; Wright, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Left-wing values include the belief in the power of [[human reason]] to achieve [[Social progress|progress]] for the benefit of the human race, [[secularism]], [[sovereignty]] exercised through the legislature, social justice and mistrust of strong personal political leadership. To the right, this is regularly seen as [[anti-clericalism]], unrealistic [[Reform movement|social reform]], doctrinaire [[socialism]] and [[class hatred]]. The Right are skeptical about the capacity for radical reforms to achieve human well-being while maintaining workplace competition. They believe in the established church both in itself and as an instrument of social cohesion; and believe in the need for strong political leadership to minimize social and political divisions. To the Left, this is seen as a selfish and reactionary opposition to social justice, a wish to impose doctrinaire religion on the population and a tendency to [[authoritarianism]] and [[Oppression|repression]].&lt;ref&gt;Knapp &amp; Wright, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Giddens, ''Beyond Left and Right, the Future of Radical Politics'', "In many continental European countries, for example, 'conservatism' suggests the political influence of Catholicism." p. 22.  "American conservatism, in some of its major forms at least, has almost from its beginnings been aggressively procapitalist in ways that its European counterparts have not." p. 23.  "(However) the basic dilemmas now faced by conservative and socialist thought are everywhere similar." p. 23.  "Conservatism, it is often said, opposes rationalism." p. 24., Stanford University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-8047-2451-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences between left and right have altered over time. The initial cleavage at the time of the [[French Revolution]] was between supporters of [[absolute monarchy]] (the Right) and those who wished to limit the king's authority (the Left). During the 19th century, the cleavage was between [[Monarchism|monarchists]] and [[Republicanism|republicans]]. Following the establishment of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] in 1871, the cleavage was between supporters of a strong [[Executive (government)|executive]] on the Right and supporters of the primacy of the [[legislature]] on the Left.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp &amp; Wright, pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage in the United States ==
The terms left-wing and right-wing are widely used in the United States, but as on the global level there is no firm consensus about their meaning. The only aspect that is generally agreed upon is that they are the defining opposites of the United States [[political spectrum]]. Left and right in the U.S. are generally associated with [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] respectively, although the meanings of the two sets of terms do not entirely coincide. Depending on the political affiliation of the individual using them, these terms can be spoken with varying implications. A 2005 poll of 2,209 American adults showed that "respondents generally viewed the paired concepts liberals and left-wingers and conservatives and right-wingers as possessing, respectively, generally similar political beliefs", but also showed that around ten percent fewer respondents understood the terms left and right than understood the terms liberal and conservative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/21354/ Right Wing, Left Wing, Chicken Wing | MediaCulture | AlterNet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary [[American Left|left in the United States]] is usually understood as a category that includes [[Modern American liberalism|New Deal social-liberals]] (in contrast to traditions of [[social democracy]] more common to Western Europe), [[John Rawls|Rawlsian liberals]] and [[Civil libertarianism|civil libertarians]], who are often identified with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. There are also leftists who reject many of the platforms of the Democratic Party in favor of more socialist policies. In general, the term left-wing is understood to imply a commitment to [[egalitarianism]], support for [[Social policy|social policies]] that appeal to the [[working class]] and [[multiculturalism]]. The contemporary center-left usually defines itself as promoting government [[regulation]] of [[business]], [[commerce]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[industry]]; protection of [[fundamental rights]] such as [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]] ([[separation of church and state]])&lt;nowiki/&gt;; and government intervention on behalf of racial, ethnic and sexual [[minorities]] and the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kazin, "American Dreamers: How the Left Changed a Nation", Knopf, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-307-26628-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevance of the terms today ==
Some political scientists have suggested that the classifications of "left" and "right" are no longer meaningful in the modern complex world. Although these terms continue to be used, they advocate a more complex spectrum that attempts to combine political, economic and social dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Ruypers, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted between 1983 and 1994 by [[Bob Altemeyer]] of Canadian legislative caucuses showed an 82% correlation between party affiliation and score on a scale for [[right-wing authoritarianism]] when comparing right-wing and [[Social democracy|social democratic]] caucuses. There was a wide gap between the scores of the two groups, which was filled by liberal caucuses. His survey of American legislative caucuses showed scores by American Republicans and Democrats were similar to the Canadian Right and liberals, with a 44% correlation between party affiliation and score.&lt;ref&gt;''The authoritarian specter'', Bob Altemeyer (1996), pp. 258–98&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norberto Bobbio]] saw the polarization of the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 1990s as evidence that the linear left–right axis remained valid. Bobbio thought that the argument that the spectrum had disappeared occurred when either the Left or Right were weak. The dominant side would claim that its ideology was the only possible one, while the weaker side would minimize its differences. He saw the Left and Right not in absolute terms, but as relative concepts that would vary over time. In his view, the left–right axis could be applied to any time period.&lt;ref&gt;''Left and right: the significance of a political distinction'' (1996) Norberto Bobbio, Allan Cameron, pp. vi–xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] writer [[David Boaz]] argued that terms left and right are used to spin a particular point of view rather than as simple descriptors, with those on the "left" typically emphasizing their support for working people and accusing the right of supporting the interests of the upper class; and those on the "right" usually emphasizing their support for [[individualism]] and accusing the Left of supporting [[collectivism]]. Boaz asserts that arguments about the way the words should be used often displaces arguments about policy by raising emotional prejudice against a preconceived notion of what the terms mean.&lt;ref&gt;David Boaz, ''The Politics of Freedom: Taking on The Left, the Right, and Threats to our Liberties'', Cato Institute, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-933995-14-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] described the main cleavage in politics as not left versus right, but [[Open–closed politics|open versus closed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/11/tony-blair-s-unfinished-business|title=Tony Blair’s unfinished business|first=Jason|last=Cowley|newspaper=New Statesman|date=24 November 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, attitudes towards social issues and globalism are more important than the conventional economic left–right issues: "open" voters tend to be [[social liberalism|socially liberal]], [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] and in favour of [[globalism]], while "closed" voters are [[cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]], [[opposition to immigration|opposed to immigration]] and in favour of [[protectionism]]. This model has seen increased support following the rise of [[Populism|populist]] and [[Centrism|centrist]] parties in the 2010s.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21702748-new-divide-rich-countries-not-between-left-and-right-between-open-and|title=Drawbridges up|newspaper=The Economist|date=30 July 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ID"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21718921-identity-does-not-have-be-exclusive-preserve-far-right-dutch-election-suggests|title=The Dutch election suggests a new kind of identity politics|date=18 March 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presidents since 1929, when [[Herbert Hoover]] took office, have generally been wealthier than before; all except [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] were millionaires. These presidents have often received income from [[Autobiography|autobiographies]] and other writing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Giving.htm |title=Giving, by Bill Clinton |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; other than [[John F. Kennedy]] (who [[Assassination of John F.

In addition, many presidents, including [[Bill Clinton]], had considerable income from public speaking after leaving office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/05/us/politics/05clintons.html?pagewanted=all|title=Clintons Made $109 Million in Last 8 Years|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=McIntyre, Mike|date=5 April 2008|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tonner"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tonner|first1=Andrew|title=The 10 Richest U.S. Presidents --  The Motley Fool|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/11/20/the-10-richest-us-presidents.aspx|website=The Motley Fool|accessdate=April 16, 2017|language=en|date=Nov 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/ Full text online]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements of U.S. national security policy ==

Measures taken to ensure U.S. national security include:

* Using diplomacy to rally allies and isolate threats.
* Marshaling economic power to elicit cooperation.
* Maintaining effective [[armed forces]].
* Implementing [[civil defense]] and [[emergency preparedness]] policies (including [[anti-terrorism legislation]])
* Ensuring the resilience and redundancy of [[critical infrastructure]].
* Using [[intelligence service]]s to detect and defeat or avoid threats and [[espionage]], and to protect [[classified information]].
* Tasking [[counterintelligence]] services or [[secret police]] to protect the nation from internal threats.&lt;ref&gt;
''Encyclopedia of United States National Security'', 2 Vol., Sage Publications (2005), {{ISBN|0-7619-2927-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. national security and the Constitution ==

The phrase “national security” entered U.S. political discourse as early as the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]]. The [[Federalists]] argued that [[civilian control of the military]] required a strong central government under a single constitution.  [[Alexander Hamilton]] wrote: “If a well-regulated militia be the most natural defense of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of the national security.” &lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist No. 29, “Concerning the Militia,” Jan. 9, 1788 [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa29.htm Full text online]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization of U.S. national security ==

U.S. National Security organization has remained essentially stable since July 26, 1947, when [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. Together with its 1949 amendment, this act:

* Created the National Military Establishment (NME) which became known as the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] when the act was amended in 1949.
* Formed a separate [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] from the existing [[United States Army Air Forces]].
* Subordinated the military branches to the new [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].
* Established the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] to coordinate national security policy in the Executive Branch.
* Chartered the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy B. Zegart, ''Flawed by Design: The Evolution of the CIA, JCS, and NSC'', Stanford University Press (1999, {{ISBN|0-8047-4131-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National security and civil liberties==

After [[9/11]], the passage of the [[USA Patriot Act]] provoked debate about the alleged restriction of individual rights and freedoms for the sake of U.S. national security.  The easing of warrant requirements for intelligence surveillance, under Title II of the Act, spurred the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;Nola K Breglio, “Leaving FISA Behind: The Need to Return to Warrantless Surveillance,” ''Yale Law Journal'', September 24, 2003. [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:nzWdnckE5vQJ:www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/113-1/BreglioFINAL.pdf Full text PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review|United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR)]] affirmed the constitutionality of warrantless national security surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;"Court Affirms Wiretapping Without Warrants," ''New York Times'', January 15, 2009.

'''Operation New Life''' (23 April – 1 November 1975) was the care and processing on [[Guam]] of Vietnamese [[refugees]] evacuated from [[Saigon]] in the closing days of the [[Vietnam War]].  More than 111,000 of the evacuated 130,000 Vietnamese refugees were transported to Guam where they were housed in tent cities for a few weeks while being processed for resettlement.  The great majority of the refugees were resettled in the [[United States]].  A few thousand were resettled in other countries or chose to return to Vietnam on the vessel ''Tuong Tin''.

==Background==

In April 1975, as the North Vietnamese Army ([[PAVN]]) advanced on Saigon, the United States carried out a massive and chaotic evacuation of Americans, nationals of allied countries, and Vietnamese who had worked for or been closely associated with the U.S. during the Vietnam War.   To deal with the refugees, President [[Gerald Ford]] on 18 April 1975 created the Interagency Task Force (IATF) for Indochina, a dozen government agencies with the responsibility to transport, process, receive and resettle Indochinese refugees, nearly all Vietnamese, in the United States.  Ford appointed L. Dean Brown of the [[Department of State]] to head Operation New Life.  Later he was replaced by [[Julia V. Taft]] of the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW).&lt;ref&gt;"Department of the Army After Action Report Operations New Life/New Arrivals" http://detic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/aO36359.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed 16 Dec 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  To finance Operation New Life the [[Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act]] was adopted on 23 May 1975. This act allocated funding of $305 million for the State Department and $100 million for HEW.&lt;ref&gt;"Public Law 94-24", 23 May 1975. http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-89/pdf/STATUTE-89-Pg89.pdf, accessed 26 Dec 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearby countries in [[Southeast Asia]] declined to accept the Vietnamese evacuees, fearing that they would have them on their soil permanently. However, Governor [[Ricardo Bordallo]], agreed to grant the Vietnamese temporary [[Asylum in the United States|asylum]] on Guam, some {{convert|2,500|miles|km}} from Saigon. On April 23, Rear Admiral [[George Stephen Morrison]], commander of U.S. Naval forces on Guam (and the father of singer [[Jim Morrison]]), was ordered to "accept, shelter, process and care for refugees as they were removed from [[South Vietnam]]."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Larry Clinton ''Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975–1982'', Jefferson, NC: MacFarland &amp; Company, 2010, p. 63; "George S. Morrison, Admiral and Singer's Father, Dies at 89" ''The New York Times'', 8 Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 130,000 Vietnamese were evacuated from Vietnam by air and sea during the last few days of April.  A few went to other locations, such as [[Wake Island]], but most were transported to Guam by U.S. and Vietnamese naval ships, commercial vessels and military and commercial aircraft. A total of 111,919 Vietnamese would be housed temporarily and processed for entry into the United States on Guam. That total included 2,600 orphans and abandoned children evacuated from Vietnam under [[Operation Babylift]] who transited Guam on 3 and 4 April en route to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Operation New Life" http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/ew_life.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed 20 Dec 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Guam had a substantial U.S. military presence to care for the Vietnamese refugees.  [[Andersen Air Force Base]] on the northern end of the island was the U.S.'s biggest [[B-52]] base and [[Naval Base Guam]] was a large deep-water port for naval vessels.

[[Typhoon]]s frequently impact Guam and the military and civilian personnel involved in Operation New Life feared that a [[typhoon]] would strike Guam while the Vietnamese were living in tents and unprotected from the elements. Fortunately, no typhoon hit Guam in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Richard ''Operation Newlife: The Untold Story'' Concord, CA: Solution Publishing, 1998, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refugees==
[[File:Aerial view of Orote Point (Guam) refugee camp c1975.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the refugee camp at Orote Point, Guam.]]
[[File:View of Orote Point (Guam) refugee camp c1975.jpg|thumb|"Tent City" at Orote Point, Guam.]]
Although not classified legally as "refugees" under international [[refugee law]], the Vietnamese on Guam were commonly called refugees as well as "evacuees" and "parolees."

The U.S. military estimated that 13,000 refugees could be housed on Guam and the first arrivals on 23 April were placed in apartments.  The numbers, however, reached 20,000 on 27 April, exceeding the capacity of existing housing.  The [[Seabees]] constructed additional housing, including bulldozing 1,200 acres of brush to create "Tent City" for 50,000 people. On 7 May, three merchant ships arrived at Guam carrying 13,000 Vietnamese, the highest number of people to arrive in a single day.  The refugee population on Guam peaked on 13 May at 50,450—more than one-half the number of permanent residents of the island. Most of the Vietnamese would spend only two or three weeks on Guam before being transported to the United States, or in a few cases to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of the evacuation of South Vietnamese had been to remove U.S. government employees and their families and other Vietnamese with close associations with the United States from the danger of persecution by the victorious North Vietnamese. Many of the refugees were former officers in the South Vietnamese military and officials of the South Vietnamese government.  However, a Congressional report summed up characteristics of the refugees who arrived in Guam as follows: "Half the Vietnamese we intended to get out did not get out – and half who did get out should not have."  The refugees included "farmers...an entire fishing village...Many gave the impression of not knowing where they were or why they were there. Some had simply fled in panic."  However, once in Guam, "their destination was the United States...how many never intended to travel to continental United States will never be known."&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. House,''Indochina Evacuation and Refugee Problems, Part IV'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the majority of the Vietnamese on Guam were from the educated elite of the country.  Twenty percent had attended a University; 40 percent were [[Catholic]], and 35 percent spoke some English—all much higher percentages than those of the Vietnamese population as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Gail P. "Coping with America. Refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in the 1970s and 1980s" ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' Vol. 487 (September 1986), pp. 138–149&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Attorney General]] used his authority to grant parole status to the Vietnamese which allowed them to enter the United States and remain permanently.

==Military participation==

More than U.S. 20,000 military personnel from all services were involved in the operation.  The military was tasked with providing transportation, operating refugee reception centers in the Pacific and the United States, and assisting civilian agencies in the resettlement program. Expenses incurred by the military were reimbursed from the funds appropriated to the IATF of which the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] was a member.&lt;ref&gt;"Department of the Army After Action Report Operations New Life/New Arrivals" http://dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/aO36359.pdf, accessed 16 Dec 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Airlifts from Saigon's [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]] unloaded at [[Andersen Air Force Base]]. Passengers were escorted to Tent City, where tents erected just hours before awaited them. Those who fled Vietnam by sea landed at the Naval Supply Station at [[Apra Harbor, Guam|Apra Harbor]]. First responders included personnel from {{USS|Proteus|AS-19|6}}, the Naval Station and [[Camp Covington]] CB Base. Tasked with providing food and shelter, Naval Station Tug Base personnel improvised housing from abandoned warehouses of decommissioned Camp Minron with cots and supplies from the base emergency hurricane supplies, fed hundreds from plastic trash cans full of fish and rice from the base galley. {{USS|Hector|AR-7|6}} also provided hot meals from her own stores and galley. Outside showers were made from a circle of metal lockers and fire hoses with sprinkler heads. The CB's set up Vietnam-style steel drum toilets, which were immediately overwhelmed.

[[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter]] and [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] aircraft unloaded and personnel processed at [[Naval Air Station Agana|NAS Agana, Brewer Field]].

Tents were set up at Army-run Camp Orote on an abandoned airstrip. At its peak it held a population of 39,331. The camp at [[Orote Point]] (called Camp Rainbow) was staffed by units from the U.S. [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] from [[Schofield Barracks, Hawaii]]; initially under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Will H. Horn (April–May), and later of Colonel Jack O'Donohue (June–September). The command consisted of the 1st Bn 5th Inf and 1st Bn 27th infantry battalions, elements of the 25th Supply and Transport Battalion, a field hospital from [[San Antonio, Texas]], and intelligence teams.&lt;ref&gt;"Department of the Army After Action Report Operations New Life/New Arrivals" dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/aO36359.pdf, accessed 16 Dec 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral Morrison would later call Operation New Life the most satisfying assignment of his career.&lt;ref&gt;"George S. Morrison, Admiral and Singer's Father, Dies at 89" ''The New York Times'', 8 Dec 2008; Thompson p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Viet Nam Tuong Tin''==

Among the refugees in Guam were about 1,600 people who requested repatriation to Vietnam.  Many of them were South Vietnamese army and naval personnel.  The Vietnamese navy had loaded up their ships with people during the evacuation and sailed out to sea, ending up in Guam.  Their families often left behind, the soldiers and sailors requested—then demanded—that they be allowed to return to Vietnam.

The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] initially took responsibility for the repatriation. The Vietnamese government demanded that a lengthy questionnaire be completed for each potential returnee.  UNHCR completed the questionnaires and submitted them, but no response was forthcoming from Vietnam.  Meantime, the refugees became more insistent in their demands to return, including staging demonstrations and threatening violence and suicide.  In September 1975, Julia Taft recommended that the Vietnamese be given the merchant ship ''Tuong Tin'' and allowed to depart Guam for Vietnam. The U.S. Navy renovated the ship for the voyage to Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Marines in Vietnam – The Bitter End, 1973–1975'', p. 225-227 http://ehistory.osu.edu/vietnam/books/end/0226.cfm; Thompson, pp 69–71&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Department was concerned that some among the potential returnees were being coerced by their colleagues into saying they wished to return to Vietnam. State isolated the potential returnees and interviewed each of them individually.  Those affirming they wished to return to Vietnam were escorted directly from the interview to the ''Tuong Tin'' for departure. Those declining to return, numbering 45, were escorted to the mostly-empty refugee camps for onward transportation to the U.S.  The total number of Vietnamese crowded onto the ''Tuong Tin'' was 1,546, of whom most were men whose families were in Vietnam. The ''Tuong Tin'' departed Guam on 16 October 1975.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Marines in Vietnam – The Bitter End, 1973–1975'', p. 225-227 http://ehistory.osu.edu/vietnam/books/end/0226.cfm; Thompson, pp 69–71&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The fate of the ''Tuong Tin'' was unknown for more than a decade. The ship's captain, Tran Dinh Tru, later told his story.  On arrival in Vietnam, Tru and at least some of his shipmates were sent to [[Re-education camp (Vietnam)|re-education camp]]s in the rural areas of Vietnam. Tru was imprisoned for 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tuong Tin'' returnees were nearly the last Vietnamese refugees on Guam. The camps there were closed on 23 October and Operation New Life terminated on 1 November 1975.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Marines in Vietnam – The Bitter End, 1973–1975'', p. 225-227 http://ehistory.osu.edu/vietnam/books/end/0226.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The Vietnamese on Guam were flown to one of four military bases: [[Fort Chaffee]] in Arkansas, [[Camp Pendleton]] in California, [[Fort Indiantown Gap]] in Pennsylvania, and [[Eglin Air Force Base]] in Florida.  There, the U.S. military provided them food and temporary housing while the IATF and charitable organizations gave them language and cultural training and sought sponsors and locations for their resettlement.  (See [[Operation New Arrivals]]) By 20 December 1975 all the Vietnamese had been resettled in every state and in several foreign countries. The self-congratulations for the success of the program were premature, however, as the coming years would see an even larger flow of Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Laotians fleeing their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Parnassos Literary Society''' ({{lang-el|Φιλολογικός Σύλλογος Παρνασσός}}) was founded in 1865 in [[Athens]] and has published various magazines.  The oldest [[literary society]] in mainland Greece,&lt;ref&gt;The Reading Society of [[Corfu]] (''Αναγνωστική Εταιρία Κερκύρας'') was created in 1836 ([http://www.anagnostikicorfu.com/index.asp?lng=en website])&lt;/ref&gt; it continues to be active today.

The Society was founded on 24 June 1865 by the four children of the numismatist {{Interlanguage link multi|Pavlos Lambros|el|3=Παύλος Λάμπρος}} to contribute to the spiritual, social, and moral improvement of the Greek people through its events. Its first president was Michael Lambros. The club quickly became well-known, and functioned as a sort of Academy with literary, archaeological, legal, artistic and even scientific sections. It organized lectures, exhibitions, and various competitions. In 1872, at the suggestion of S. Vassiliadis, it opened a night school for destitute children. The historian [[Constantine Paparrigopoulos]] became honorary chairman.

It was officially recognized as a [[nonprofit organization]] by the Greek state on March 17, 1875.

The club is now housed in a private mansion on the St. George Square designed by Ifikratis Kokkidis (Ιφικράτης Κοκκίδης). The club has a valuable library and art gallery with 250 works by Greek artists.

==Publications==

From 1877–1895, the club published the magazine ''Parnassos'' (Παρνασσός).&lt;ref name='mag'&gt;[http://www.lsparnas.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=28&amp;lang=en Society's Web page on its publications]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1896–1939, it published ''Epeteris'' (Επετηρίς, "Yearbook").&lt;ref name='mag'/&gt;

From 1959 to the present, the club has published a second series of ''Parnassos'' quarterly.&lt;ref name='mag'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hollis.harvard.edu/?itemid=|library/m/aleph|005926889 bibliographic record at Harvard Libraries]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Poseidon of Melos''' is a statue of [[Poseidon]] in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]] (NAMA), with the inventory number 235, which is dated to the last quarter of the second century BC. It is believed to be dated back to the Hellenistic Period.

The statue was found in 1877 on the island of [[Melos]]. It is made of [[Parian marble]] and has a height of 2.35 metres, which makes it more than lifesize. The statue was found in several pieces, which have been reattached to one another. Portions of the left foot and of the [[himation]] are modern recreations. Parts of the nose, beard and hair are missing. 

The sea god is depicted [[heroic nudity|naked to the waist]] in an awe-inspiring pose, with his muscular right arm raised, probably in order to hold a [[trident]] (now lost). His himation hangs around his hips, covering his legs and genitals; he holds it in place at his side with his left hand. His back is also partially covered; a bit of cloth lies, mysteriously suspended, on his left shoulder. His weight rests on his right leg, his left leg is left free. The musculature of his arms and his body generally are very finely worked. The head is slightly tilted to the left and his gaze is directed into the distance. There is a dolphin behind the statue to the right, which serves as an additional support for the weight of the statue. The pose is a standard one for Poseidon, [[Zeus]] and [[Hades]].

In [[phonetics]], an '''r-colored''' or '''rhotic vowel''' (also called a '''retroflex vowel''', '''vocalic r''', or a '''rhotacized vowel''') is a [[vowel]] that is modified in a way that results in a lowering in frequency of the third [[formant]].&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;  R-colored vowels can be articulated in various ways: the tip or blade of the tongue may be turned up during at least part of the articulation of the vowel (a [[retroflex]] articulation) or the back of the tongue may be bunched. In addition, the vocal tract may often be constricted in the region of the [[epiglottis]].&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;

R-colored vowels are rare, occurring in less than one percent of the languages of the world.&lt;ref name="l"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they occur in two of the most widely spoken languages: [[North American English]] and [[Mandarin Chinese]].  In North American English, they are found in words such as ''butt'''er''''', ''n'''ur'''se'' and, for some speakers, ''st'''ar'''t''. They also occur in [[Quebec French]], some varieties of [[Brazilian Portuguese]],&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://dspace.c3sl.ufpr.br/dspace/bitstream/handle/1884/3955/CARACTER%C3%8DSTICAS%20FON%C3%89TICO.pdf?sequence=1 Acoustic-phonetic characteristics of the Brazilian Portuguese's retroflex /r/: data from respondents in Pato Branco, Paraná].

== Notation ==
In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], an r-colored vowel is indicated by a [[Hook (diacritic)|hook diacritic]] ({{IPA| ˞ }}) placed to the right of the regular symbol for the vowel. For example, the IPA symbol for [[schwa]] is {{IPA|ə}}, while the IPA symbol for an r-colored schwa is {{IPA|ɚ}}.
This diacritic is the hook of {{IPA|ɚ}}, a symbol constructed by [[John Samuel Kenyon]] along with {{IPA|ᶔ}} by adding the retroflex hook (right hook) to {{IPA|ə}} and {{IPA|ɜ}}.&lt;ref name="Kenyon1935-p191"&gt;{{cite book

|page=191
|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030999984;view=1up;seq=209
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both {{IPA|ɚ}} and {{IPA|ɝ}} were proposed as IPA symbols by editors of the ''American Speech'' in 1939 to distinguish it from {{IPA|əɹ}}.&lt;ref name="AmericanSpeech1939"&gt;{{cite news

|date=October 1939
|pages=206–208
|publisher=Duke University Press
|doi=10.2307/451421
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPA adopted several ways to transcribe r-colored vowels in its 1947 chart: the turned r {{IPA|ɹ}}; the superscript turned r {{IPA|əʴ}}, {{IPA|aʴ}}, {{IPA|eʴ}}, {{IPA|ɔʴ}}, etc.; the retroflex hook {{IPA|ᶕ}}, {{IPA|ᶏ}}, {{IPA|ᶒ}}, {{IPA|ᶗ}}, etc.;&lt;ref name="IPAChart1947"&gt;{{cite news
|title=The International Phonetic Alphabet (revised to 1947)
|journal=Le Maître Phonétique

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and added {{IPA|ɚ}} as a variant of {{IPA|ᶕ}} in its 1951 chart.&lt;ref name="IPAChart1952"&gt;{{cite news
|title=The International Phonetic Alphabet (revised to 1951)
|journal=Le Maître Phonétique
|number=97
|date=January 1952
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the retroflex hook was dropped due to insufficient usage.&lt;ref name="Wells1976"&gt;{{cite news

|pages=2‒3
|doi=10.1017/S0025100300001420
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, after the [[International Phonetic Association Kiel Convention|Kiel Convention]], the hook of {{IPA|ɚ}} and {{IPA|ɝ}} was adopted as a diacritic placed on the right side of the vowel symbol for r-colored vowels, e.g. [ɛ˞ o˞ ɔ˞].&lt;ref name="IPA-1989"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of the superscript turned r ({{IPA|əʴ}}) is still commonly seen.

== Examples ==

=== English ===
{{See also|Rhoticity in English}}

R-colored vowels are found in most rhotic forms of English, including [[General American#R-colored vowels|General American]] and [[Hiberno-English#R-coloured vowels|Irish English]]. The r-colored vowels of General American can be written with "vowel-r" [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s:&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite book

*{{IPA|[ɚ]}}: ''h'''ear'''se'', ''ass'''er'''t'', ''m'''ir'''th'' (stressed, conventionally written {{IPA|[ɝ]}}); ''stand'''ar'''d'', ''dinn'''er''''', ''Lincolnsh'''ir'''e'' (unstressed)
*{{IPA|[ɑ˞]}}: ''st'''ar'''t'', ''c'''ar'''''
*{{IPA|[ɔ˞]}}: ''n'''or'''th'', ''w'''ar'''''

In words such as ''start'', many speakers have r-coloring only in the coda of the vowel, rather than as a simultaneous articulation modifying the whole duration.  This can be represented in IPA by using a succession of two symbols such as {{IPA|[ɑɚ]}} or {{IPA|[ɑɹ]}}, rather than the unitary symbol {{IPA|[ɑ˞]}}.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; 

==== Singing ====
In European classical singing, dropping or weakening of r-colored vowels has been nearly universal and is a standard part of classical vocal training, but there have always been other singing styles, including [[traditional Irish singing|traditional Irish singing styles]] and those of many performers of [[country music]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In certain particular cases, a vowel + /r/ is pronounced instead as two syllables: a non-rhotic vowel followed by a [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] /r/.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Mandarin Chinese ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
{{main|Erhua}}
In [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], the rhotacized ending of some words is the prime way by which to distinguish speakers of Standard  Northern Mandarin (Beijing Mandarin) and Southwestern Mandarin from those of other forms of Mandarin in China.  Mandarin speakers call this phenomenon ''[[erhua]]''. In many words, the ''-r'' suffix ({{zh|t=兒|s=儿}}) is added to indicate some meaning changes. If the word ends in a velar nasal (''ng''), the final consonant is lost and the vowel becomes [[nasalization|nasalized]].  Major cities that have this form of rhotacized ending include [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], [[Tangshan]], [[Shenyang]], [[Changchun]], [[Jilin]], [[Harbin]], and [[Qiqihar]]. This ''erhua'' has since spread to other provincial capitals not home to [[Standard Mandarin]], such as [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Jinan]], [[Xian]], [[Chongqing]], and [[Chengdu]].

In [[rhotic accent]]s of Standard Mandarin, such as those from [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], most of the [[Hebei]] province (e.g. [[Tangshan]], [[Baoding]], [[Chengde]]), eastern [[Inner Mongolia]] (e.g. [[Chifeng]], [[Hailar District|Hailar]]), and in [[northeastern provinces|the Northeast]], vocalic r occurs as a [[diminutive]] marker of nouns ({{zh|p=ér}}) and the [[perfective aspect]] particle ({{zh|c=了|p=le}}). This also occurs in the middle syllables of compound words consisting of three or more syllables. For example, the name of the famous restaurant [[Go Believe]] (狗不理) in Tianjin is pronounced as 'Gourbli' (''Gǒu(r)b&lt;s&gt;ù&lt;/s&gt;lǐ'' → ''Gǒurblǐ''). The name of the street [[Dazhalan]] (大栅栏) in Beijing is pronounced as 'Da-shi-lar' (''Dàshà&lt;s&gt;n&lt;/s&gt;là&lt;s&gt;n&lt;/s&gt;(r)'' → ''Dàshílàr'').

=== Quebec French ===
In [[Quebec French]], the vowel {{IPA|/œ̃/}} is generally pronounced {{IPA|[œ̃˞]}} and the r-colored vowels are also pronounced in loan words.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} For example, the word ''hamburger'' can be pronounced {{IPA|[ambɚɡɚ]}}, the word ''soccer'' can be pronounced {{IPA|[sɒkɚ]}} etc.

=== Brazilian Portuguese ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
Many dialects of [[Brazilian Portuguese]] express the {{IPA|/ɾ/}} or {{IPA|/ʁ/}} phoneme in [[Syllable#Coda|coda]] position (when not followed by a vowel in the next word) as rhotacization of the syllable nucleus. This appears in words like {{lang|pt|p'''or'''ta}} {{IPA|[ˈpɔ˞ːtə̻̆], [ˈpɒ˞ːtə̻̆]}} (door) and {{lang|pt|c'''ar'''ne}} {{IPA|[ˈka˞ːnɪ]}} (meat, flesh).

Such a process can be found among speakers from remote rural regions throughout Brazil, but is an areal feature of {{lang|pt|[[caipira dialect|caipira]]}}, {{lang|pt|interior paulista}} and {{lang|pt|sertanejo}} in particular, where it is found even across major urban areas. More prestigious dialects and idiolects tend to use {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or [[Guttural R#Portuguese|guttural pronunciations]], and less prestigious ones would have a full-fledged coda {{IPA|[ɻ]}} (otherwise known as {{lang|pt|erre caipira}}).

Some people have a rhotic vowel in free variation with a retroflex approximant coda i.e. {{lang|pt|co'''r'''}} {{IPA|[ˈkoɻ]}} (color), or with {{IPA|[ɾ]}}, as is common across the [[Greater São Paulo]] and in much of hinterland southern Brazil, while in the case of {{lang|pt|sertanejo}}, the rhotic vowel is often followed by a {{IPA|[h]}} or {{IPA|[ɦ]}}, the latter when preceding voiced consonants.

Generally, in any dialect of Brazilian Portuguese, the deletion of coda {{IPA|/ɾ/}} or {{IPA|/ʁ/}}, when those are found in infinitives, is a staple of casual registers, but in educated speech often not so much. When {{IPA|/ɾ/}} or {{IPA|/ʁ/}} are produced at the end of infinitives, they are usually not pronounced as a coronal approximant or as vowel coloring.

=== Other examples ===
In the 1930s the [[Dravidian language]] [[Badaga language|Badaga]] had two degrees of rhoticity among all five of its vowels, but few speakers maintain the distinction today, and then only in one or two vowels. An example is non-rhotic {{IPA|[be]}} "mouth", slightly rhotacized ("half retroflexed") {{IPA|[be˞]}} "bangle", and fully rhotacized ("fully retroflexed") {{IPA|[be˞˞]}} "crop".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/appendix/languages/badaga/badaga.html  &lt;!--The source may be Emeneau, M.B. (1939) “The vowels of the Badaga language.” Language 15 (1); 43-47. I hope someone would check it.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Algic language]] [[Yurok language|Yurok]] illustrated rhotic [[vowel harmony]]. The non-high vowels {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} could become {{IPA|/ɚ/}} in a word that has {{IPA|/ɚ/}}. For example, the root {{IPA|/nahks-/}} 'three' became {{IPA|/nɚhks-/}} in the word {{IPA|/nɚhksɚʔɚjɬ/}} 'three (animals or birds)'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/yurok.php|title=Yurok – Survey of California and Other Indian Languages|website=linguistics.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luobohe Miao]] also contains {{IPA|[ɚ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://omniglot.com/writing/luobohemiao.htm|title=Luobohe Miao language|website=Omniglot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarat Chandra Das''' ({{lang-bn|শরৎচন্দ্র দাস}}) (1849–1917) was an [[India]]n scholar of [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan language]] and [[Tibetan culture|culture]] most noted for his two journeys to Tibet in 1879 and in 1881–1882.

==Biography==
Born in [[Chittagong]], [[east Bengal|eastern Bengal]] to a Bengali [[Hindu]] Vaidya-Brahmin family, Sarat Chandra Dash attended [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]], as a student of the [[University of Calcutta]]. In 1874 he was appointed headmaster of the [[Bhutia Boarding School, Darjeeling|Bhutia Boarding School at Darjeeling]]. In 1878, a Tibetan teacher, Lama [[Ugyen Gyatso]] arranged a passport for Sarat Chandra to go the [[monastery]] at [[Tashilhunpo]]. In June 1879, Das and Ugyen-gyatso left [[Darjeeling]] for the first of two journeys to [[Tibet]]. They remained in Tibet for six months, returning to Darjeeling with a large collection of Tibetan and [[Sanskrit]] texts which would become the basis for his later scholarship. Sarat Chandra spent 1880 in Darjeeling poring over the information he had obtained. In November 1881, Sarat Chandra and Ugyen-gyatso returned to Tibet, where they explored the [[Yarlung Valley]], returning to India in January 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Journey to Lhasa and Central Tibet, Das, Sarat Chadra, pp xi–xiii, Paljor Publications, New Delhi, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Alnog with [[Satish Chandra Vidyabhusan]], he prepared Tibetan-English dictionary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZlyDot9RyGcC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Satish+Chandra+Vidyabhusan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WCO129M24M&amp;sig=vgAnH3O6kZS3xMG0KjpcGGest2M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ7bLVqufaAhWLKo8KHYaHAvUQ6AEISTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Satish%20Chandra%20Vidyabhusan&amp;f=false|title=Collected Papers on Buddhist Studies|last=Padmanabh S. Jaini|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, he worked as a spy for the British, accompanying [[Colman Macaulay]] on his 1884 expedition to [[Tibet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commodities of Empire: Working Paper No.9|first1=Vibha|last1=Arora|chapter=Routing the Commodities of Empire through Sikkim (1817-1906)|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/ferguson-centre/commodities-of-empire/working-papers/WP09.pdf|publisher=[[Open University]]|ISSN=1756-0098|year=2008|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to gather information on the Tibetans, Russians and Chinese. After he left Tibet, the reasons for his visit were discovered and many of the Tibetans who had befriended him suffered severe reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Austine Waddell, ''Lhasa and Its Mysteries: With a Record of the Expedition of 1903-1904'', Cosimo, Inc., 2007, 740 pages, p. 79: "The ruin thus brought about by the Babu's visit extended also to the unfortunate Lama's relatives, the governor of Gyantsé (the Phal Dahpön) and his wife (Lha-cham), whom he had persuaded to befriend Sarat C. Das. These two were cast into prison for life, and their estates confiscated, and several of their servants were barbarously mutilated, their hands and feet were cut off and their eyes gouged out, and they were then left to die a lingering death in agony, so bitterly cruel was the resentment of the Lamas against all who assisted the Babu in this attempt to spy into their sacred city."&lt;/ref&gt;

For the latter part of his life, Das settled in Darjeeling. He named his house "[[Lhasa]] Villa" and played host to many notable guests including [[Sir Charles Alfred Bell]] and [[Ekai Kawaguchi]]. Johnson stated that, in 1882 Das met with [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], the two individuals notable for the founding of the [[Theosophical Society]].

'''Satirical ostraca''' are a category of [[Ostracon|ostraca]], (singular: an ''ostracon''), that represent the real world in unrealistic, impossible situations&amp;ndash;a [[satire]]. The common example portrayed which helped create this categorization, are [[animal]]s which take reversed roles, for example a ''vertically&amp;ndash;walking cat, with ducks on the end of [[leash]]es.'' The same role reversals can be seen on [[Satirical papyri]]. This concept is a prevalent feature in absurdist literature, such as in the works of [[Mikhail Bulgakov]].

'''Slab-O-Concrete Productions''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mail order]] [[Direct market|distributor]] and [[publisher]], founded by Peter Pavement, Dave Hanna, Emma Copsey, and Chris Tappenden; operating mostly in [[Brighton and Hove]] during the 1990s. Initially selling [[United Kingdom|British]] [[small press]] [[comics]] and [[zine]]s (including Pavement's own comics), Slab-O-Concrete also imported publications from the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and [[Europe]].

Slab-o-Concrete was originally based in [[Sheffield]]; it moved to [[Brighton and Hove|Hove]] in 1995. After intensely ramping up its publishing line in the late nineties (including moving into CDs and prose books), Slab-O-Concrete was laid low in 2001 as policy changes in the book industry caused cash-flow issues.

== History ==
In general, Slab-O-Concrete avoided distributing traditional [[comic book]]s, instead making connections with [[Underground comix|underground]] publishers, [[zine]]sters, [[independent record label]]s, and other [[Subculture|subcultural]] scenes.

By 1994 Slab-O-Concrete had developed into a publisher, repackaging small press comics and zines for the bookshop market and originating new works. Notable creators published by Slab-O-Concrete included [[Jessica Abel]], [[Ian Carney]], [[Craig Conlan]], [[Alan Moore]], [[Woodrow Phoenix]], and [[Aleksandar Zograf]].

In 1998, Slab-O-Concrete published four titles in partnership with [[Amnesty International]]. The comics were designed as 16-page [[minicomics]] with card stock covers, designed to be sealed and used as postcards. [[ILYA|Ilya]]'s ''A Bowl of Rice'' was about the forcible relocation and killing of [[Shan people|Shan]] rice farmers in [[Burma]]. Enrique Rodríguez's ''Freedom from Discrimination'' was a story about maltreatment of and violence against street children in [[Brazil]], and undocumented, unaccompanied immigrant children in the [[United States]]. Dan Jones' ''Just Deserts'' told the story of a female [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[migrant worker]]'s false conviction and punishment in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Peter Arkle's ''Love'' told the story of Mariana Cetiner, a [[Romanians|Romanian]] woman arrested and imprisoned for allegedly attempting to seduce another woman. In 1999, Slab-O-Concrete published another 16-page mailable minicomic called ''Donna's Day'', by Donna Mathes and [[Peter Bagge]].

One of their final publications, in 1999, was ''The Worm: the Longest Comic Strip in the World'', by [[Alan Moore]] and a "galaxy of greats," which was published in association with the Cartoon Art Trust and the Swedish Council for Cultural Affairs. "In one single working day, over 125 British cartoonists gathered together in one place to create 'the longest comic [wordless] strip in the world.'"&lt;ref&gt;''The Worm'' (Slab-O-Concrete Productions, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Worm'' featured introductions and explanatory text in English, Swedish, and French.

There are literary, archaeological, epigraphic and numismatic '''sources of ancient Tamil history'''. The foremost among these sources is the [[Sangam literature]], generally dated to the last centuries BCE to early centuries CE. The poems in Sangam literature contain vivid descriptions of the different aspects of life and society in [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamilakam]] during this age; scholars agree that, for the most part, these are reliable accounts. Greek and Roman literature, around the dawn of the [[Christian era]], give details of the maritime trade between Tamilakam and the [[Roman empire]], including the names and locations of many ports on both coasts of the Tamil country.

Archaeological excavations of several sites in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]] have yielded remnants from the Sangam era, such as different kinds of pottery, pottery with inscriptions, imported ceramic ware, industrial objects, brick structures and spinning whorls. Techniques such as [[stratigraphy]] and [[paleography]] have helped establish the date of these items to the Sangam era. The excavated artifacts have provided evidence for existence of different economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature such as agriculture, weaving, smithy, gem cutting, building construction, pearl fishing and painting.

Inscriptions found on caves and pottery are another source for studying the history of Tamilakam. Writings in [[Tamil-Brahmi]] script have been found in many locations in [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Sri Lanka]] and also in Egypt and Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article482654.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=Iravatham | last=Mahadevan | title=An epigraphic perspective on the antiquity of Tamil | date=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly recording grants made by the kings and chieftains. References are also made to other aspects of the Sangam society. Coins issued by the Tamil kings of this age have been recovered from river beds and urban centers of their kingdoms. Most of the coins carry the emblem of the corresponding dynasty on their reverse, such as the bow and arrow of the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]]; some of them contain portraits and written legends helping numismatists assign them to a certain period.

By far, the most important source of ancient Tamil history is the corpus of Tamil poems, referred to as [[Sangam literature]], generally dated from the last centuries of the pre-Christian era to the early centuries of the Christian era.&lt;ref name=subrahmanian_tamilsource&gt;{{cite book

The ''akam'' poems deal with inner human emotions such as love and the ''puram'' poems deal with outer experiences such as society, culture and warfare. They contain descriptions of various aspects of life in the ancient Tamil country. The ''[[Maduraikkanci]]'' by Mankudi Maruthanaar contains a full-length description of [[Madurai]] and the Pandyan country under the rule of Nedunj Cheliyan III.&lt;ref name="sastri2_maduraikanci"&gt;{{cite book

The ''[[Purananuru]]'' and ''[[Akanaṉūṟu]]'' collections contain poems sung in praise of various kings and also poems that were composed by the kings themselves. The Sangam age anthology ''[[Pathirruppaththu]]'' provides the genealogy of two collateral lines for three or four generations of the Cheras, along with describing the Chera country, in general. The poems in ''[[Ainkurnuru]]'', written by numerous authors, were compiled by Kudalur Kizhar at the instance of Chera King ''Yanaikkatcey Mantaran Ceral Irumporai''.The Chera kings are also mentioned in other works such as ''Akanaṉūṟu'', ''[[Kuruntokai]]'', ''[[Natrinai|Natṟiṇai]]'' and ''Purananuru''.&lt;ref name="krishnamurthy_cherasangam"&gt;{{cite book

It mentions ''Eelattu-unavu'' – food from [[Eelam]] – arriving at the port. One of the prominent Sangam Tamil poets is known as [[Eelattu Poothanthevanar]] meaning Poothan-thevan (proper name) hailing from ''Eelam'' mentioned in ''Akanaṉūṟu'': 88, 231, 307; ''[[Kuṟuntokai|Kurunthokai]]'': 189, 360, 343 and ''[[Naṟṟiṇai]]'': 88, 366.

The historical value of the Sangam poems has been critically analysed by scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries. Sivaraja Pillay, a 20th-century historian, while constructing the genealogy of ancient Tamil kings from Sangam literature, insists that the Sangam poems show no similarities with ancient Puranic literature and medieval Tamil literature, both of which contain, according to him, fanciful myths and impossible legends. He feels that the Sangam literature is, for the most part, a plain unvarnished tale of the happenings of a by-gone age.&lt;ref name=sivaraj_reliability&gt;{{cite book

He asserts that the picture drawn by the poets is in obedience to literary tradition and must have been based on solid foundation in the facts of contemporary life; he proceeds to use the Sangam literature to describe the government, culture and society of the early Pandyan kingdom.&lt;ref name=sastri_reliability&gt;{{cite book

Among the critics of using Sangam literature for historical studies is Herman Tieken, who maintains that the Sangam poems were composed in the 8th or 9th century and that they attempt to describe a period much earlier than when they were written.&lt;ref name="tiekenbook"&gt;Tieken, Herman Joseph Hugo (2001) Kāvya in South India: old Tamil Caṅkam poetry. Groningen: Egbert Forsten. pp. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt;
Tieken's methodology of dating Sangam works has been criticized by Hart,&lt;ref&gt;George Hart III. "Review of Tieken's ''Kavya in South India.''" ''Journal of the American Oriental Institute'' ''124'':1. pp. 180–184. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferro-Luzzi,&lt;ref&gt;G.E. Ferro-Luzzi. "Tieken, Herman, ''Kavya in South India'' (Book review). ''Asian Folklore Studies''. June 2001. pp. 3733–74&lt;/ref&gt; and Monius.&lt;ref&gt;Anne E. Monius, Book review, The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 61, No. 4 (November 2002), pp. 1404–1406&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Caldwell, a 19th-century linguist, dates the Sangam works to a period that he calls the Jaina cycle which was not earlier than the 8th century; he does not offer an opinion on the historical value of the poems.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Robert. 1974. A comparative grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages. New Delhi: Oriental Books Reprint Corp&lt;/ref&gt; Kamil Zvelebil, a Czech indologist, considers this date quite impossible and says that Caldwell's choice of works are whimsical.&lt;ref&gt;Zvelebil, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Champakalakshmi states that since the Sangam period is often stretched from 300 BCE to 300 CE and beyond, it would be hazardous to use the Sangam works as a single corpus of source for the entire period.&lt;ref&gt;Champakalakshmi, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the Sangam poems were created between the 1st century and 4th century and many of them are free from literary conceits.&lt;ref&gt;''Cankam literature'', The new Encyclopædia Britannica (Vol. 2). Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2002. p. 802&lt;/ref&gt; The Macropaedia mentions that the historical authenticity of sections of Sangam literature has been confirmed by archaeological evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''India'', The new Encyclopædia Britannica (Macropædia Vol. 21).

He also gives various details about the trading relationship between the Tamil kingdoms and Rome. [[Pliny the Elder]] (c. 77 CE) refers to many Tamil ports in his work ''The Natural History''. The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' (c. 60–100 CE) gives an elaborate description of the Tamil country and describes the riches of a 'Pandian Kingdom':
:""Then come Naura and [[Tyndis]], the first markets of [[Damirica]] (Limyrike), and then [[Muziris]] and Nelcynda, which are now of leading importance. Tyndisis of the [[Chera Dynasty|Kingdom of Cerobothra]]; it is a village in plain sight by the sea. Muziris, of the same Kingdom, abounds in ships sent there with cargoes from Ariake, and by the Greeks; it is located on a river, distant from Tyndis by river and sea five hundred stadia, and up the river from the shore twenty stadia...Nelcynda is distant from Muziris by river and sea about five hundred stadia, and is of another Kingdom, the Pandian. This place also is situated on a river, about one hundred and twenty stadia from the sea...."&lt;ref&gt;''Periplus'' 54. Original Greek: "Ἡ δὲ Νέλκυνδα σταδίους μὲν ἀπὸ Μουζιρέως ἀπέχει σχεδὸν πεντακοσίους, ὁμοίως διά τε ποταμοῦ (καὶ πεζῇ) καὶ διὰ θαλάσσης, βασιλείας δέ ἐστιν ἑτέρας, τῆς Πανδίονος• κεῖται δὲ καὶ αὐτὴ παρὰ ποταμὸν, ὡσεὶ ἀπὸ σταδίων ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι τῆς θαλάσσης."&lt;/ref&gt;

One such port, [[Kudiramalai]] is mentioned in Greek as ''Hippuros'', a famous port of the Malabar country in Ceylon to the ancient Greeks. Pliny states that in the reign of the Emperor [[Claudius]] in 47 CE:
:"Annius Plocamus, a freedman, having farmed the customs of the Red Sea, was, while sailing along the coast of [[Arabia]] over fifteen days, driven by contrary winds into Hippuros, a port of [[Taprobane]], where he was entertained with kindly hospitality by the king. In six months' time he acquired a thorough knowledge of the Tamil language."

An embassy of four envoys were sent from the island to Rome, including ambassador-in-chief Rasaiah from the King of Kudiramalai. To the Romans, the Kudiramalai envoys related particulars about their kingdom's inhabitants, including their common life expectancy of 100 years, their government, a council of thirty persons, free civil liberties and laws pertaining to abuse of sovereign power, their trade with the Seres (Chinese), their festivals surrounding "the chase", and their delights in the elephant and the tiger. The ambassadors felt their kingdom to be richer than Rome's, although in their eyes Rome put its wealth to much better use.&lt;ref&gt;Tambi-Piḷḷai Isaac Tambyah. ''Psalms of a Saiva Saint''.

The Pandyas also had trade contacts with [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and, through Egypt, with [[Rome]] by the 1st century, and with [[China]] by the 3rd century. The 1st century Greek historian [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] met, at Damascus, the ambassador sent by an Indian King "named Pandion or, according to others, Porus" to [[Caesar Augustus]] around 13 CE (Strabo XV.1–4, and Strabo XV.1–73).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;layout=&amp;loc=15.1.73 Strabo XV.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archeological sources ==

According to Abraham, the Sangam era corresponds roughly to the period 300 BCE–300 CE, based on archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Many historical sites have been excavated in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]], many of them in the second half of the 20th century. One of the most important archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu is Arikamedu, located {{convert|3|km|mi}} south of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]]. According to Wheeler, it was an [[Roman trade with India|Indo-Roman trading]] station that flourished during the first two centuries CE. It has been suggested that [[Arikamedu]] was first established as a settlement c. 250 BCE and lasted until 200 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Begley, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kodumanal]] and [[Perur]], villages on the banks of the [[Noyyal river]] in [[Coimbatore district]], were situated on the ancient trade route between [[Karur]] and the west coast, across the [[Palghat gap]] on the [[Western Ghats]]. Both sites have yielded remains belonging to the Sangam age.&lt;ref&gt;Rajan, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandran, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kaveripumpattinam]], also known as Puhar or [[Poompuhar]], is located near the [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]] delta and played a vital role in the brisk maritime history of ancient Tamilakam. Excavations have been carried out both on-shore and off-shore at Puhar and the findings have brought to light the historicity of the region. The artefacts excavated date between 300 BCE and early centuries CE. Some of the off-shore findings indicate that parts of the ancient city may have submerged under the advancing sea, as alluded to by the Sangam literature.&lt;ref&gt;Tripati et al., pp. 86, 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korkai]], a port of the [[Early Pandyan Kingdom|early Pandyas]] at the [[Tamraparani basin]], is now located 7&amp;nbsp;km inland due to the retreating shoreline caused by sediment deposition. [[Alagankulam]], near the [[Vaigai delta]], was another port city of the [[Pandyas]] and an archaeological site that has been excavated in the recent years. Both the [[Pandyan]] ports have provided clues about local occupations, such as [[pearl]] fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Gaur and Sundaresh, pp. 126–7&lt;/ref&gt; Other sites that have yielded remnants from the [[Sangam period|Sangam age]] include [[Kanchipuram]], [[Kunnattur]], [[Malayampattu]] and [[Vasavasamudram]] along the [[Palar]] river; [[Sengamedu]] and [[Karaikadu]] along the [[Penner River|Pennar river]]; [[Perur]], [[Tirukkampuliyur]], [[Alagarai]] and [[Urayur]] along the [[Kaveri river]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandran, pp. 92–131&lt;/ref&gt;
These excavations have yielded different varieties of [[Pottery|ceramics]] such as black and red ware, rouletted ware and Russet coated ware, both locally made and imported kinds. Many of the [[pottery]] sherds contain [[Tamil-Brahmi]] inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Other artifacts such as brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items, remains of seeds and shells provide clues about the nature of the settlements and the other aspects of life during the [[Sangam age]]. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in the material records of Tamilakam are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evidence for economic activities ===
[[File:GreyPotteryWithEngravingsVirampatnamArikamedu1stCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|Grey pottery with engravings, [[Arikamedu]], 1st century CE.]]
Archeological evidence for agriculture in the Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as [[Mangudi (Tirunelveli District)|Mangudi]], [[Kodumanal]] and [[Perur]], which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping seems to have been undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke et al., pp. 342–3, 348–9&lt;/ref&gt; Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In [[Arikamedu]], a few terracotta ring-wells were found at the bottom of the reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;Tripati et al., pp. 86–88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaur and Sundaresh, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b472&gt;Begley, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt;

A research survey at Kodumanal has unearthed the remains of an ancient blast furnace, its circular base distinguishable by its white colour, probably the result of high temperature. Around the base, many iron slags, some with embedded burnt clay, vitrified brick-bats, many terracotta pipes with vitrified mouths and a granite slab, which may have been the anvil, have been recovered. Absence of potsherds and other antiquities has suggested that the smelting place was located outside the boundary of habitation. More furnaces were discovered at the same site with burnt clay pieces with rectangular holes. The pieces were part of the furnace wall, the holes designed to allow a natural draught of air to pass through evenly into the furnace. Many vitrified crucibles were also recovered from this site; one of them notable because it was found in an in situ position.&lt;ref&gt;Rajan, pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of steel making is also found in the crucibles excavated at this site.&lt;ref&gt;Rajan, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to iron and steel, the metallurgy seems to have possibly extended to copper, bronze, lead, silver and gold objects.&lt;ref&gt;Rajan, pp. 98–102&lt;/ref&gt; At Arikamedu, there were indications of small-scale workshops containing the remains of working in metal, glass, semiprecious stones, ivory and shell.&lt;ref name=b472 /&gt; Kodumanal has yielded evidence for the practice of weaving, in the form of a number of intact terracotta spindle whorls pierced at the centre by means of an iron rod, indicating the knowledge of cotton spinning and weaving. To further strengthen this theory, a well preserved piece of woven cotton cloth was also recovered from this site.&lt;ref&gt;Rajan, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Dyeing vats were spotted at Arikamedu.&lt;ref&gt;Begley, p. 475&lt;/ref&gt;

Many brick structures have been located at [[Kaveripumpattinam]] during on-shore, near shore and off-shore explorations; these provide proof for building construction during Sangam age. The on-shore structure include an I-shaped wharf and a structure that looks like a reservoir. The wharf has a number of wooden poles planted in its structure to enable anchorage of boats and to facilitate the handling of cargo. Among other structures, there is a Buddhist vihara with parts of it decorated using moulded bricks and stucco. Near shore excavations yielded a brick structure and a few terracotta ring wells. Off-shore explorations located a fifteen course brick structure, three courses of dressed stone blocks, brick bats and pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Tripati et al., pp. 86, 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; At Arikamedu, there were indications of a structure built substantially of timber, possibly a wharf. Conical jars that could have been used for storing wine and oil have been found near structures that could have been shops or storage areas. Evidence of continued building activity are present at this site, with the most distinctive structures being those of a possible warehouse, dyeing tanks and lined pits.&lt;ref name=b472 /&gt;

Kodumanal was popular for the gem-cutting industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz are located in the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal.&lt;ref&gt;Rajan, pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations at [[Korkai]] have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region.&lt;ref&gt;Gaur and Sundaresh, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.&lt;ref&gt;Rajan, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

There are remnants of many of the items imported from and exported to the Roman empire, at [[Arikamedu]]. Imported items recovered from here include ceramics such as amphorae and sherds of Arretine ware, glass bowls, Roman lamps, a crystal gem and an object resembling a stylus. Artifacts that may have been meant for export include jewellery, worked ivory, textiles and perhaps leather or leather-related products.&lt;ref&gt;Begley, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; Similar looking ornaments have been recovered from Arikamedu and Palatine Hill in Rome, further confirming that this site was a leading trade center.&lt;ref name=b472 /&gt; The Pandyan port city Alagankulam has yielded a rouletted pottery ware that bears the figure of a ship on the shoulder portion. This figure is very similar to a finding reported from [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], an ancient port of the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Gaur and Sundaresh, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Wharf-like structures found at many port cities indicate that they might have been used as docks. Based on marine explorations of various port-sites, it has been suggested that stone anchors may have been used since as early as the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Athiyaman and Jayakumar, p. 1266&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epigraphical sources ==

During the later half of the 20th century, several inscriptions of the Sangam age have been discovered in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Most of them are written in Tamil-Brahmi script and are found in rocks or on pottery. The information obtained from such inscriptions have been used to corroborate some of the details provided by the Sangam literature.

=== Cave inscriptions ===
The 2nd and 13th rock edicts of Ashoka (273–232 BCE) refers to the Pandyas, Cholas, Cheras and the Satiyaputras. According to the edicts, these kingdoms lay outside the southern boundary of the Mauryan Empire. The Hathigumpha inscription of the Kalinga King, Kharavela, (c. 150 BCE) refers to the arrival of a tribute of jewels and elephants from the Pandyan king. It also talks about a league of Tamil kingdoms that had been in existence 113 years before then.&lt;ref&gt;Aiyangar, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest epigraphic records of the Tamil country in Tamil Nadu were found in [[Mangulam]] village near Madurai. The cave inscriptions, deciphered in 1966, have been dated to the 2nd century BC and record the gift of a monastery by Pandyan king Nedunj Cheliyan to a Jain monk. These inscriptions are also the oldest Jain inscriptions in South India and among the oldest in all of India.&lt;ref&gt;Mahadevan, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; References to Sangam age Chera dynasty are found in Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions of 3rd century CE found on [[Edakkal Caves|rocks in Edakal hill]] in Wynad district of Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;Mahadevan, pp. 8–11&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient port city of [[Thondi]] is mentioned in inscriptions found in [[Kilavalavu]] village near Madurai.&lt;ref&gt;Mahadevan, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The early part of the 20th century saw the discovery of about 39 inscriptions in a dozen locations, all near Madurai. The most significant of these were the ones at Alagarmalai and Sittannavasal. The Alagarmalai inscriptions, dated to the 1st century BCE, record the endowments made by a group of merchants from Madurai. Another set of inscriptions from the 2nd century CE, found at Pugalur village near Karur, document the construction of a rock shelter by a Chera king of the Irumporai line for a Jain monk, ''Cenkayapan''. Cave inscriptions at Arachalur, dated to the 4th century, provide evidence for the cultivation of music and dance in the Tamil country.&lt;ref&gt;Mahadevan, pp. 12–21&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest inscriptional evidence of the chieftains of the Sangam age was found at Jambai, a village near the town of Tirukkoyilur in Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu. These inscriptions belonging to the 1st century CE record the grants made by the chieftain Atiyaman Netuman Anci who ruled from Takatur. According to epigraphist I. Mahadevan, there were some reservations initially, about the linguistic details in the inscriptions, but further investigations have confirmed their authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Mahadevan, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions from the 2nd century CE found at Mannarkoil village in Tirunelveli district contain a reference to a ''katikai'', which could mean an assembly of learned persons or an institution of higher learning. An inscription belonging to the early Cholas has been discovered near Tiruchirappalli and has been dated between the 2nd and 4th century.
An analysis of the geographical sites of these cave inscriptions points to the possibility of the Tamil-Brahmi script having been created at Madurai around the 3rd century BCE and its disseminations to other parts of Tamil country thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Mahadevan, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pottery inscriptions ===
{{See also|Tissamaharama Tamil Brahmi inscriptions}}
Inscriptions on pottery, written in Tamil-Brahmi, have been found from about 20 archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu. Using methods such as stratigraphy and palaeography, these have been dated between the 2nd century BCE and 3rd century CE. Also found in present-day [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]], similar inscriptions in Tamil-Brahmi have been found outside the ancient Tamil country in [[Thailand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Tamil-Brahmi inscription on pottery found in Thailand |url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/07/16/stories/2006071603952000.htm |publisher=The Hindu |date= 2006-07-06 |accessdate=2007-08-05 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Red Sea]] coast in [[Egypt]].
[[Arikamedu]], the ancient port city of the [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]], and [[Urayur]] and [[Puhar]], their [[Early Cholas|early capitals]], have yielded several fragmentary pottery inscriptions, all dated to the Sangam age. [[Kodumanal]], a major industrial center known for the manufacture of gems during this period, had remains of pottery with inscriptions in Tamil, [[Prakrit]] and Sinhala-Prakrit. [[Alagankulam]], a thriving sea port of the early [[Pandyan Kingdom|Pandyas]], has yielded pottery inscriptions that mention several personal names including the name of a [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] prince. One of the pottery sherds contained the depiction of a large [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ship. Many other ancient sites such as [[Kanchipuram]], [[Karur]], [[Korkai]] and [[Puhar]] have all yielded pottery with inscriptions on them. Outside of Tamil Nadu and [[Kerala]], inscriptions in Tamil-Brahmi have been found in [[Srikakulam]] district in Andhra Pradesh, [[Jaffna]] in modern Sri Lanka, ancient Roman ports of [[Qusier al-Qadim]] and [[Berenike]] in Egypt. The 2nd century BCE potsherds found in excavations in [[Poonakari|Poonagari]], [[Jaffna]], bear Tamil inscriptions of a clan name – ''vēḷāṉ,'' related to ''[[velirs]]'' of the [[ancient Tamil country]].&lt;ref name=ETEHar&gt;{{cite book | last=Mahadevan | first=Iravatham | author-link=Iravatham Mahadevan | title=Early Tamil Epigraphy: From the Earliest Times to the Sixth Century A.D. | series=Harvard Oriental Series vol. 62 | publisher=Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies, Harvard University | place=Cambridge, Mass | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-674-01227-1}} p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions at Berenike refer to a Tamil chieftain Korran.&lt;ref&gt;Mahadevan, pp. 43-49&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other inscriptions ===
The [[Thiruparankundram]] inscription found near [[Madurai]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] and dated on palaeographical grounds to the 1st century BCE, refers to a person as a householder from [[Eelam]] (''Eela-kudumpikan'').&lt;ref name="TN"&gt;{{cite web  | last =Akazhaan   | first =   | authorlink =   | title =  Eezham Thamizh and Tamil Eelam: Understanding the terminologies of identity | work =   | publisher =[[Tamilnet]]   | url = http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=27012  | doi =   | accessdate = 2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reads: ''erukatur eelakutumpikan polalaiyan'' - "Polalaiyan, (resident of) Erukatur, the husbandman (householder) from Eelam.&lt;ref name="Schalk"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schalk | first=Peter | contribution=Robert Caldwell's Derivation īlam&lt;sīhala: A Critical Assessment | editor-last=Chevillard | editor-first=Jean-Luc | title=South-Indian Horizons: Felicitation Volume for François Gros on the occasion of his 70th birthday | place=Pondicherry | publisher=Institut Français de Pondichéry | isbn=978-2-85539-630-9 | pages=347–364 | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from caverns and pottery, Tamil-Brahmi writings are also found in coins, seals and rings of the Sangam age. Many of them have been picked up from the Amaravathi river bed near Karur. A smaller number of inscribed objects have been picked up from the beds of other rivers like South Pennar and Vaigai. An oblong piece of polished stone with Tamil-Brahmi inscription has been located in a museum in the ancient port city of [[Khuan Luk Pat]] in southern Thailand. Based on the inscription, the object has been identified as a touchstone (''uraikal'') used for testing the fitness of gold. The inscription is dated to 3rd or 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mahadevan, pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polity from inscriptions ===
Epigraphy provides an account of various aspects of Sangam polity and has been used to verify some of the information provided by sources such as literature and numismatics. The names of various kings and chieftains occurring in the inscriptions include Nedunj Cheliyan, Peruvaluthi, Cheras of the Irumporai family, Tittan, [[Nedunkilli]], Adiyaman, Pittan and [[Korrantai]]. References to administration includes the chiefs, superintendents, titles of ministers, palace of merchants and the village assembly. Religious references to Buddhist and Jain monks are found frequently, which have provided valuable information explaining the spread of those religions in Tamilakam. Brief mentions of various aspects of the Sangam society such as agriculture, trade, commodities, occupations, the social stratification, flora, fauna, music and dance, names of cities and names of individuals are also found in the inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Mahadevan, pp. 115–159&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numismatic sources ==
Another important source of studying ancient Tamil history are the coins that have been found in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. The coins belonging to the Sangam age, found in [[Tamil Nadu]] are generally classified into three categories. The first category consists of [[Numismatic terminology#P|punch-marked]] coins from [[Magadha]] (400 BCE–187 BCE) and the [[Satavahanas]] (200 BCE–200 CE). The second category is made up of coins from the [[Roman Empire]] dated from 31 BCE to 217 CE, coins of Phoenicians and Seleucids and coins from the Mediterranean region (c. 300 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Karur coins of Greeks, Romans and Phoenicians|url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/leisure/article28504.ece|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=3 October 2009|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third category of Sangam age Tamil coins are the punch-marked silver, copper and lead coins dated 200 BCE–200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. The coins belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading relationships that the Tamil people had with the kingdoms of northern India and the outside world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam age Tamil polity. The third category of coins, however, have provided direct testimony to the existence of ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pandyan coins ===
Among the many  coins attributed to the early Pandyas, are a series of punch-marked coins made of silver and copper, that are considered to belong to the earliest period. Six groups of silver punch-marked coins and one group of copper coins have been analysed so far. All of these punch-marked coins have a stylised fish symbol on their [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]], which is considered the royal emblem of the Pandyas. On the [[obverse]] of these coins are a variety symbols such as the sun, the sadarachakra, the trishul, a dog, stupa etc. The first group of silver coins was found at [[Bodinayakanur]], in a hoard containing 1124 coins all belonging to the same type. The remaining coins in the five silver group and the copper group were all found in the Vaigai river bed near [[Madurai]]. Four of the six silver groups have been assigned a date close to the end of the [[Mauryan]] rule, c. 187 BCE. Since [[Tamilakam]] was deficient in metallic silver and since Roman silver did not become available in abundance until later, around 44 BCE, it has been postulated that the Pandyan kings melted silver from the coins brought in by trade with [[Magadha]] or some foreign location other than [[Rome]]. The names of the Pandyan kings who issued this series of coins is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy, pp. 14–20&lt;/ref&gt; Another series of coins, all made of copper and found near Madurai, have the fish symbol on the reverse and among other symbols on the obverse, have the legend ''Peruvaluthi'' written in the [[Tamil-Brahmi]] script. They have been assigned a date of around 200 BCE and are considered to have been issued by the Pandyan king Peruvaluthi. These coins are represent some of the few instances where the names of Sangam kings appear in non-literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy, pp. 20–23&lt;/ref&gt; Sangam literature mentions the importance attached to Vedic sacrifices by Tamil kings including the Pandyan Mudukudumi Peruvaludhi. This fact is also corroborated by the discovery of several Pandyan coins that are referred to as the ''Vedic sacrifice'' series. These coins have symbols on their obverse that depict the sacrifices, such as a horse tied to the ''yuba-stambha'', a ''yagna kunta'' and a ''nandhipada''.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy, pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; More coins with animal symbols such as the tortoise, the elephant and the bull have been found and assigned to the Pandyan kings. Some of them even have a human portrait, possibly of the king who issued those coins, on their obverse. There are also Pandyan coins belonging to the 1st century BCE that have symbols depicting pearls, signifying the importance of pearl fishery to the Pandyan kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The excavations at Algankulam, near Madurai, recovered two copper coins of the early Pandyas along with Northern Black Polished Ware. These coins have been assigned a broad time period ranging from 200 BCE to 200 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chera coins ===
Many of the coins assigned to the Chera kings of Sangam age with a portrait and the legends "Makkotai" or "Kuttuvan Kotai" have been found near the [[Amaravathi River|Amaravathi river]] bed in [[Karur district|Karur]] and elsewhere in [[Coimbatore district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moeseprints.incois.gov.in/304/1/H17-Archeo.PDF |title=Archaeo metallurgical study on select Pallava coins|author= |year=2003|work=|publisher=Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They depict the royal emblem of the Cheras, the bow and arrow symbol, on the reverse. It was generally believed that the Satavahanas were the first indigenous monarchs to issue silver portrait coins. That has been disproved by the discovery of Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins belonging to the 1st century AD or a little later. Silver coins issued by [[Augustus]] and [[Tiberius]] have over a period of time been discovered in large numbers from the Coimbatore-Karur region.&lt;ref name="Roman connection in Tamil Nadu"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/28/stories/2007012800201800.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Roman connection in Tamil Nadu | date=28 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Chera coins, the "Makkotai series" bears a unique pattern not found in other Tamil coins of its age. They contain both the portrait of a king (facing right) and a written legend, in this case the word "Makkotai" written in [[Tamil-Brahmi]] script. These coins exhibit similarities with the [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] of emperors [[Augustus]] and [[Tiberius]]; like the Roman coins, the portraits on the Makkotai series do not show any jewellery on the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roman connection in Tamil Nadu|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/28/stories/2007012800201800.htm|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=28 January 2007|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are thought to be made of two separate pieces joined by lead, a practice prevalent elsewhere in India at that time. Official seals of the bearing the name "Makkotai" have also been recovered from the river bed; these seals contain the portrait facing left and the legend "Makkotai" written backwards (right-to-left). The reverse of the seals is blank. The Makkotai coins and the seals have been assigned a date range of 100 BC to end of 100 AD.&lt;ref name="Krishnamurthy, pp. 97–103"&gt;Krishnamurthy, pp. 97–103&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the portraits on the Makkotai coins are that they do not have identical head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they all have the same written legend. Such an observation has been made of coins assigned to the [[Western Satraps|Western Kshatrapas]] of [[Gujarat]], which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera coins. Scholars who analyzed the varying portraiture on the Kshatrapa coins have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the coins could be of different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their coins or the coins all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his different ages. Based on such theories, the Chera coins could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.&lt;ref name="Krishnamurthy, pp. 97–103" /&gt;

Another series of Chera coins depicts various animals along with symbols on its obverse and the Chera emblem on its reverse. Elephant, horse, bull, tortoise and lion are the animals depicted in this series, along with snake and fish. Symbols of inanimate objects include arched hills, battle axe, conch, river, [[swastika]], [[trident]], flowers and the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy, pp. 62–96&lt;/ref&gt;

A few other coins that contain a portrait and a legend have been unearthed; a coin assigned to certain Kuttuvan Kotai with his portrait and the legend "Kuttuvan Kotai" is notable for the occurrence of the "pulli" in the legend. Based on paleography of the script, it has been assigned a date of the late 1st century to early 2nd century AD. A coin belonging to 100 AD with the legend "Kollipurai" and a full-body portrait of a warrior has been assigned to the king Kopperum Cheral Irumporai, as he was known as the victor of Kolli in literature. Another coin of roughly the same period of 100 AD with the legend "Kolirumporaiy" and a warrior portrait has been found; it has not been assigned to a single king, but based on the legend, there are at least six Chera kings who could be associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy, pp. 103–107&lt;/ref&gt;

A Chera coin with the portrait of a king wearing a Roman helmet was discovered from Karur. The obverse side of the silver coin has the portrait of a king, facing left, wearing a Roman-type bristled-crown helmet. This coin maybelong to the 1st century BC and may be earlier to Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins. With a flat nose and protruding lips, he has a wide and thick ear lobe but wears no ear-ring. The person depicted appears to be elderly. Unlike other Chera silver portrait coins, the king's portrait on this coin faces left. The coin points to Romans having had trade contacts with the Chera kings and establishes that the Roman soldiers had landed in the Chera country to give protection to the Roman traders who had come there to buy materials.&lt;ref name="Roman connection in Tamil Nadu" /&gt;

Archaeological investigations conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made of copper from near [[Cochin]]. This was for the first time, from a stratographic context, coins of Sangam Chera period have been found in Kerala. The coin, which is almost a square in shape, has an elephant facing to the right and some symbols towards the top of the coin. The symbols could not be identified as the upper part of the coin was partially corroded. A drawn bow and arrow was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is an elephant goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear a striking resemblance to the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muzirisheritage.in/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2708/stories/20100423270806200.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/04/30/stories/2004043014340300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Copper coins of Adi Chera period excavated | date=30 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chola coins ===
[[File:Gold coin of Raja Raja Chola I.JPG|thumbnail|Gold coin of [[Raja Raja Chola I]], 985 – 1014, found in Sri Lanka.]]
The number of Chola coins discovered so far are not as many as those of Pandyas; most of them have been found from archeological excavations at [[Puhar]] and [[Arikamedu]], and also beds of rivers [[Amaravathi River|Amaravathi]] near Karur and South Pennar near Tirukkoilur. An early Chola coin has also been found in Thailand. The Chola coins do not contain a portrait or a legend and all of them depict symbols of animals and other inanimate objects like the animal series of the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]]. But, all of them carry the symbol of a tiger, the Chola emblem, on their reverse. One of the coins has been assigned a date earlier than 200 BCE and some others to about the time of Roman influence, which is around the dawn of the Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy, pp. 111–130&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coins of Chieftains ===
Parts of the Sangam age Tamil country were ruled over by several independent chieftains, alongside the three crowned monarchs. Among them, coins belonging to the chieftains of the Malayaman clan have been found in Tamil Nadu. Many of them contain a written legend on the obverse and all of them have the image of a flowing river on their obverse. Based on the legends some of these coins have been assigned to specific rulers such as Tirukkannan, also known as Malaiyan Choliya Enadi Tirukkannan, and Tirumudi Kari. A series of coins without a legend but with a horse as the principal motif on the obverse have been assigned to the Malayaman chieftains, because of the river symbol on the obverse. Numismatist R. Krishnamurthy, dates these coins to the period between 100 BCE and 100 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy, pp. 132–148&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eelam Tamil coins ===
Excavations in the area of [[Tissamaharama]] in southern Sri Lanka have unearthed locally issued coins produced between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE, some of which carry Tamil personal names written in early Tamil characters, which suggest that Tamil merchants were present and actively involved in trade along the southern coast of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;Mahadevan, I. "Ancient Tamil coins from Sri Lanka", pp. 152-154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bopearachchi, O. "Ancient Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu", pp. 546-549&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanislav Libenský''' and '''Jaroslava Brychtová''' are [[contemporary art|contemporary artists]]. Their works are included in many major [[modern art]] collections, such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]. 

Jaroslava Brychtová, a sculptor, and Stanislav Libenský, originally a painter and later a [[glass art|glass artist]], met in 1954. They married in 1963 and worked together until Libenský's death on February 24, 2002. Libenský painted and sketched the designs, and Brychtová made clay sculptures from his designs. Since Libenský's death, Brychtová has continued to produce castings. Their work is characterised by simple block shapes infused with subtle colours and nuances.

==Education and artistic partnership==

[[File:Red Pyramid.jpg|thumb|Red Pyramid]]
Stanislav Libenský began his study of [[glass]] in 1937 at the Specialized School of Glassmaking in Nový Bor, [[Czechoslovakia]], a region encompassing the Czech-German border called the [[Sudetenland]]. When the German army occupied the Sudetenland in 1938, Libenský moved first to the school at Železný Brod, and later to [[Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague|Prague Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design]], known as VŠUP (an abbreviation of Vysoká škola uměleckoprůmyslová v Praze) from which he graduated in 1944. His first notable series in glass, created in Nový Bor between 1945 and 1948, were thin crystal vessels, delicately etched and enameled with themes from the Bible and [[Renaissance art]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Dan, "Artists in Glass", Mitchell Beazley, an imprint of Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., Great Britain, 2001, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1948 Libenský returned to VŠUP, where he studied under Josef Kaplický, a painter, sculptor and architect who headed the school of painting on glass. Through his dynamic teaching style and modernist ideas, Kaplický had a tremendous influence on his students and thus on the independence of glass as an art form in Czechoslovakia. In 1953 Libenský returned to Železný Brod to become the director of the Specialized School of Glassmaking. It was during that time that he met Jaroslava Brychtová, the daughter of the school's co-founder, Jaroslav Brychta.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Peter S., "Stanislav Libenský, 80; Redefined Glass Art", The New York Times, March 2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jaroslava Brychtová began to experiment with casting and carving glass in the late 1940s. She founded the Center for  Architectural Glass at the Specialized School of Glassmaking in 1950. Like Libenský, Brychtová studied at VŠUP. The war interrupted her education, but she later finished her studies with a concentration in sculpture. Her teachers were Karel Štipl (from 1945 to 1951) and Jan Lauda (from 1947 to 1950).&lt;ref name="libensky"&gt;[http://www.libensky.net/jbzian.htm Libenský website]. Accessed 3/31/10&lt;/ref&gt; Jaroslava Brychtová's career at the Specialized School of Glassmaking in Železný Brod spanned 1950 to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Petrová, Sylva, "Czech Glass", Gallery, Prague, Czech Republic, 2001 {{ISBN|80-86010-44-9}}, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; The couple began their long collaboration in 1954.&lt;ref name="libensky"/&gt; when Brychtová created a sculptural glass bowl modeled after a sketch of a bowl-shaped head that Libenský had made. According to Libenský, the two worked well together because he was trained as a painter, and she as a sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Libenský and Brychtová married in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, 2001 p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==1958 Brussels Expo==
The Czechoslovakian pavilion at the EXPO '58 in Brussels garnered attention for its modern architectural design, its film, acting and ballet presentations, it was Czech glass that attracted the attention of the judges.&lt;ref&gt;Petrová, 2001, pp. 49, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The entry designed by Libenský and Brychtová, "Animal Reliefs" (later known as "[[Zoomorphic]] Stones"), were cast glass "stones". These were smooth on the obverse; on the reverse, animals inspired by the cave paintings of [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] and [[Lascaux]] were cast in negative low relief. The effect presented by this, when viewed through the smooth surface of the glass, is of a three-dimensional form captured within its depths. Incorporated into a concrete wall in the pavilion's "Glass" gallery, "Animal Reliefs" was awarded a Grand Prix. While the original work did not survive, a recreation of it was installed in the [[United Nations Headquarters|United Nations headquarters]] in Geneva.&lt;ref name="Klein, 2001, p. 118"&gt;Klein, 2001, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; In developing the negative modeling technique employed in "Animal Reliefs", Brychtová and Libenský created the foundation on which the majority of their later sculptural work was based.&lt;ref&gt;Petrova, 2001, pp. 49-52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prague Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design (VŠUP)==
Josef Kaplický’s death in 1962 left a void at VŠUP that was filled by Libenský, who was appointed a professor in the glass department in 1963. Libenský was an excellent teacher who respected the tradition of glass in Czechoslovakia while furthering his own ideas about the modern direction of glass art. His career at the academy lasted nearly one-quarter of a century. During that time, despite the opposition of the Communist government that had taken hold of the country in the late 1940s, Libenský was able not only to influence two generations of glass artists through his teaching but also, through international lecturing and exhibition of his and Jaroslava Brychtová’s works, build international interest in modern Czech glass art. Notable students of Professor Libenský include Jiří Harcuba, [[František Janák]], Marian Karel, [[Ivana Mašitová]] and Yan Zoritchak (Ján Zoričák).&lt;ref&gt;Petrová, Sylva, 2001, pp. 243, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural Commissions==
Much of Libenský and Brychtová's architectural work was done for buildings in Czechoslovakia, including two windows, created  for the [[St. Wenceslas Chapel]] in Prague's [[St. Vitus Cathedral]]. Built in the fourteenth century, the historic chapel was reconstructed by the Czech government between 1961 and 1964. Libenský and Brychtová were selected by competition to replace the chapel's original stained glass windows, which dated from 1912–13. The artists created an abstract design for the windows that, in its modern simplicity, departed from the ornate, early sixteenth-century decoration of the chapel. To relate the new to the old, Libenský and Brychtová used the muted grey-brown, grey-green and pink hues in the chapel's frescoes as the predominate colors in their windows.&lt;ref&gt;Petrova, 2001, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of Czechoslovakia their architectural glass work was seen in World's Fair exhibitions and Czech Embassies.&lt;ref name="Klein, 2001, p. 118"/&gt; At [[Expo 67|Expo '67]] in [[Montreal]], Canada, they created three large sculptures for the Czechoslovakian Pavilion's "Hall of Century and Traditions". These were "Blue Concretion", "Sun of the Century", and "Large Conus".&lt;ref&gt;Petrova, 2001, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; According to Corning Museum of Art curator Tina Oldknow, these large-scale sculptures in glass were "a revelation" to the American Studio Glass artists who saw them, including [[Harvey Littleton]], [[Dale Chihuly]] and [[Marvin Lipofsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Oldknow, Tina, "Contemporary Glass Sculptures and Panels: Selections from the Corning Museum of Glass", The Corning Museum of Glass in association with Hudson Hills Press LLC, Manchester, Vermont, 2008 p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Libenský was awarded honorary doctorates by the [[Royal College of Art]] in London in 1994, the [[Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague]] in 2001, and together with Brychtova, by the [[University of Sunderland]] in 1999 and the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Petrová, 2001, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libensky.net Short biography and photographs of Libenský / Brychtová works]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 he was named a Chevalier of the [[Ordre des Arts et Lettres]] by the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] in Paris, France. He won the [[Herder Prize]] from the [[University of Vienna]], Austria, in 1975. With his wife and collaborative partner, Jaroslava Brychtová, Libenský was accorded a number of honors. the pair were presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award from Urbanglass in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and the Glass Art Society in 1997 and 1996, respectively. They won the Bavarian State Prize and Gold Medal at the Internationale Handwerksmesse in [[Munich]], Germany, in 1995 and 1967, and received Gold Medal awards from Internationales Kunsthandwerk in [[Stuttgart, Germany]], in 1969 and at the VIII Bienal de [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]], Brazil, in 1965. Libenský and Brychtová were presented with the Rakow Award for Excellence in Glass from the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Oldknow, Tina, "Voices of Contemporary Glass: The Heineman Collection", The Corning Museum of Glass, Corning, NY, 2009 p. 359-360&lt;/ref&gt;  They received the 1958 Grand Prize at [[Expo 58|Expo ’58]] in Brussels, Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hellergallery.com/libensk-brychtov/|title=Libenský / Brychtová|website=HELLER GALLERY|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla has an 80% degree of [[vertical integration]] in 2016 according to [[Goldman Sachs]]. The integration includes own sales channels and proprietary charging infrastructure among others.

==States with total direct sales bans==

===Michigan (also bans service centers)===
On October 1, 2014, Michigan [[Michigan House of Representatives|House]] Bill 5606, drafted "to keep automakers from forcing dealers to charge different documentation fees to different customers,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Tesla's sales limits in Michigan tightened by one word of law |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20141020/RETAIL/141029995/teslas-sales-limits-in-michigan-tightened-by-one-word-of-law |date=2014-10-21 |first=Chris |last=Gautz |publisher=[[Crain Communications, Inc.]] |accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; was amended with a section stating that a manufacturer shall not "sell any new motor vehicle directly to a retail customer other than through its franchised dealers." The word "its" was removed, which assumed the manufacturer already had dealerships. Both houses passed the revised bill the next day, with only one nay vote from [[Tom McMillin]] in either house of the [[Michigan Legislature]]. Tesla argued that the original law would have allowed them to sell, because they did not yet have franchised dealers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=New Jersey bans direct auto sales |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2014/10/16/tesla-faces-direct-sales-ban-michigan/17359253/ |date=2014-10-16 |first1=Michael |last1=Martinez |first2=Michael |last2=Wayland |publisher=[[The Detroit News]] |agency=Business Insider.com |accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, [[General Motors]] released a statement saying that governor [[Rick Snyder]] should sign the bill into law because "we believe that House Bill 5606 will help ensure that all automotive manufacturers follow the same rules to operate in the State of Michigan."

===South Carolina (also bans service centers)===
[[South Carolina]] bans manufacturer ownership of new car dealerships and manufacturer service/repair of cars they do not own.

===Louisiana (also bans service centers)===
[[Louisiana]] enacted a law in June 2017 that bans direct to consumer sales of vehicles. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meachum|first1=Alex|title=Tesla speaks out against La bill|url=http://www.arklatexhomepage.com/news/local-news/tesla-speaks-out-against-la-bill/732494733|website=arklatex|publisher=arklatex|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dolzer|first1=Mike|title=Tesla hit with new Louisiana law that prohibits direct sales in state|url=https://www.teslarati.com/louisiana-law-prohibit-tesla-direct-sales/|website=teslarati|publisher=teslarati|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/06/tesla-says-new-law-will-prohibit-direct-sales-in-louisiana/ Tesla says new law will prohibit direct sales in Louisiana], June 6, 2017, The Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas===
Texas law states "Except as provided by this section, a manufacturer or distributor may not directly or indirectly:(1) own an interest in a franchised or nonfranchised dealer or dealership;(2) operate or control a franchised or nonfranchised dealer or dealership; or(3) act in the capacity of a franchised or nonfranchised dealer. (Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 2301.476) and "A motor vehicle shall not be advertised for sale in any manner that creates the impression that it is being offered for sale by the manufacturer or distributor of the vehicle. An advertisement shall not contain terms such as “factory sale,” “fleet prices,” “wholesale prices,” “factory approved,” “factory sponsored,” “manufacturer sale,” use a manufacturer's name or abbreviation in any manner calculated or likely to create an impression that the vehicle is being offered for sale by the manufacturer or distributor, or use any other similar terms which indicate sales other than retail sales from the dealer" (43 Tex. Admin. Code § 215.261).

These laws make it illegal to buy a car from Tesla in person, at a Tesla Gallery. Thus, all Texas orders are taken via the internet or over the phone. Texas residents can still easily buy a car from Tesla, but the purchase is handled as an out-of-state transaction. This may mean that the price will not include Texas state sales tax, which instead must be paid when the buyer registers the car with the state.  In 2015, Tesla lobbied the [[Texas Legislature]] to modify the law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://txlobby.com/uncategorized/texas-lobbyist-news-tesla-poised-lobbying-blitz-2015/ |title=Tesla Poised for Lobbying Blitz in 2015 |website=Texas Lobby Group, Conservative Lobbyists |date=2015-01-21 |accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow Tesla to sell directly to consumers, and specifically allow Tesla employees to discuss "financing, leasing, or purchasing options" at the firm's existing stores in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Dallas]], and [[Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=White |first=Ronald D. |title=Tesla CEO takes dealer fight to Texas, says he can sell more cars |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-ceo-takes-dealer-fight-to-texas-says-he-can-sell-more-cars-20130410,0,1676772.story |accessdate=2013-04-15 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas considered legislation in 2015 to allow Tesla to operate in the state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20150220/RETAIL07/150229983/tesla-could-open-up-to-12-texas-stores-if-legislation-passes |title=Tesla could open up to 12 Texas stores if legislation passes |first=Hannah |last=Lutz |work=Automotive News |date=2015-01-20 |accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but legislation was not passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bgr.com/2015/05/20/tesla-sales-texas-model-s/ |title=Tesla Sales Texas: Direct sales of Tesla Model S not coming to Texas |first=Yoni |last=Heisler |website=BGR |date=2015-05-20 |accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2016}}, most of the [[Republican Party of Texas|GOP delegates]] support direct sales while [[Greg_Abbott#Governor_of_Texas|Governor Abbott]] prefers the current system. According to [[Texans for Public Justice]], Tesla spent $1.3m on lobbyists while dealerships spent $1m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2016/05/texas-auto-dealers-receive-tesla-sized-dent-from-state-gop.html/|title=Texas auto dealers receive Tesla-sized dent from state GOP|publisher=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|website=Trail Blazers Blog|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utah===
[[Utah]] also bans direct auto sales. In connection with Tesla's request in 2016 that the [[Utah Supreme Court]] reverse the state's ban on direct auto sales, the automobile dealers filed documents to the court that was interpreted as supporting Tesla's case by stating: 'Tesla builds a car. It has four wheels. You press a pedal with your foot to make it go, and you turn the steering wheel to change direction. That you plug it in rather than gas it up is a trifle'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ksl.com/?sid=40787647&amp;nid=157&amp;title=utah-car-dealers-weighing-in-on-tesla-court-fight |title=Utah car dealers weighing in on Tesla court fight |first=Lindsay |last=Whitehurst |work=KSL Broadcasting |location=Salt Lake City |date=2016-07-24 |access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://electrek.co/2016/07/25/tesla-direct-sales-lawsuit-dealerships-utah/ |title= Tesla Direct Sales Lawsuit: Dealerships argue they could sell Tesla vehicles because ‘they have 4 wheels’ |website= electrek.co |first= Fred |last= Lambert |date= 2016-07-25 |accessdate= 2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tesla has a gallery showroom open in Salt Lake City that was originally intended to be a store.

==States with limited sales==

===Colorado (1 store limit)===
Tesla opened its first and only [[Colorado (state)|Colorado]] store in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] in 2009.  A 2010 revision to the state dealership law removed the word "franchised". This closed the loophole that Tesla had used to open a direct dealership but grandfathered in the existing single store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121008/RETAIL07/310089952/dealers-call-tesla-factory-stores-illegal Dealers call Tesla factory stores illegal], Automotive News, Oct 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  This limitation was supported by the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2010a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont/F1E54AE218AB9411872576A80026BCE8?Open&amp;file=1049_01.pdf Colorado House Bill 10-1049]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/12/tesla-motors-limited-to-one-store-in-colorado-and-none-in-new-jersey/ Tesla limited to one store in Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt;  The store moved from Boulder to the [[Park Meadows]] shopping mall in [[Lone Tree, Colorado|Lone Tree]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westword.com/news/tesla-motors-moves-from-boulders-pearl-street-showroom-to-park-meadows-5894577 Tesla Motors moves from Boulder's Pearl Street showroom to Park Meadows]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Virginia Tesla has obtained license from the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] (DMV) for a single direct sales dealership ([[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]]). Upon learning of Tesla's attempt to obtain a second dealership in the state, the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association filed a lawsuit in March 2016 against both Tesla and the DMV to prevent the licensing of the second dealership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.hybridcars.com/virginia-dealers-protest-teslas-retail-store-moves/ |title= Virginia Dealers Protest Tesla’s Retail Store Moves |website= hybridcars.com |first= Jon |last= LeSage |date= 2016-06-02 |accessdate= 2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, the [[Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles]] (VDMV) recommended ending Tesla direct sales, as at least 11 dealerships were interested in selling Tesla vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.com/business/local/article_cba531aa-f928-584a-8691-ed42fba636fd.html |title=DMV hearing officer rules against Tesla Motors request for Richmond-area dealership|website=Richmond Times-Dispatch |accessdate= 2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VDMV later allowed Tesla to open another shop ([[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]), as Tesla has no dealerships to compete against;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-01/tesla-wins-right-to-open-virginia-store-in-win-against-dealers |title=Tesla Wins Right to Open Virginia Store in Win Against Dealers|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate= 2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 11 interested dealerships would not be able to compete on undiscounted prices, as Tesla has the same price online and in shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/tesla-gets-green-light-for-second-virginia-store/2016/11/30/b9f7d4f6-b73d-11e6-959c-172c82123976_story.html |title=Tesla gets green light for second Virginia store |date=2016-11-30 |website=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate= 2016-12-02 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161201111351/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/tesla-gets-green-light-for-second-virginia-store/2016/11/30/b9f7d4f6-b73d-11e6-959c-172c82123976_story.html |archivedate= 2016-12-01 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vdmv&gt;[https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/commercial/dealer/pdf/tesla_file2016_001.pdf Formal Evidentiary Hearing: Tesla Motors, Inc., File No. 2016-001 - Request for a Hearing Pursuant to Va.

On March 10, 2014, it was announced that [[New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission]] and Governor [[Chris Christie]]'s administration would be holding a meeting to pass a new proposal into law. This new proposal, PRN 2013-138, was announced one day before it was to be put into law. Tesla responded by saying that the proposal "seeks to impose stringent licensing rules that would, among other things, require all new motor vehicles to be sold through middlemen and block Tesla's direct sales model," and that "[Governor Christie's] Administration has decided to go outside the legislative process by expediting a rule proposal that would completely change the law in New Jersey."&lt;ref name=Business&gt;{{Cite news |title=Tesla Goes To War Against Chris Christie |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-motors-vs-chris-christie-2014-3 |date=2014-03-11 |first=Hunter |last=Walker |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |agency=Business Insider.com |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was passed, and "Tesla will no longer [be able to] sell electric cars in New Jersey, effective April 1".

[[Wyoming]] banned direct sales until a law change in 2017 that created a direct sale manufacturer's license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/legislature-passes-a-bill-that-would-allow-tesla-to-open/article_c35d1d64-3392-5bad-837a-adefbd3f7927.html Legislature passes a bill that would allow Tesla to open showroom, service shop in Wyoming], Casper Star Tribune&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://openstates.org/wy/bills/2017/SF57/&lt;/ref&gt;  Electric cars were seen as a way to promote the use of [[coal]] mined in the state.

===Arizona (2017 court ruling)===
[[Arizona]] blocked direct sales until June 2017 when an administrative law judge ruled that the Arizona Department of Transportation interpreted the law incorrectly. This was after a years legal long battle by Tesla.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/tech/2017/06/22/tesla-selling-electric-cars-scottsdale-store-arizona/416527001/ Yes, you can buy a Tesla electric car at its Scottsdale store]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhode Island (2017)===
In December 2017, Tesla was granted a license by the state of Rhode Island after DMV lawyers concluded that the law blocking direct auto sales only applied to manufactures that have franchise dealers.

As of March 21st, 2018, Utah Governor Herbert signed into law allowing Tesla direct sales in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://universe.byu.edu/2018/04/19/tesla-enters-utah-market-as-more-drivers-switch-to-electric/|title=Tesla enters Utah market as more drivers switch to electric - The Daily Universe|date=2018-04-19|work=The Daily Universe|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveys==
In 2014, [[Consumer Reports]] performed a [[Mystery shopping|mystery shopper]] survey of 19 secret shoppers in 85 dealerships, querying electric vehicles (EV). Most shoppers found it to be a positive experience, although 35 dealerships recommended petrol cars instead, and 13 discouraged EVs. The most knowledgeable dealerships were Chevrolet, and the least were Toyota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/04/dealers-not-always-plugged-in-about-electric-cars-secret-shopper-study-reveals/index.htm |title=Dealership Survey - Electric Cars |publisher=[[Consumer Reports]] |date=2014-04-22 |accessdate=2016-08-22 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170130230407/http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/04/dealers-not-always-plugged-in-about-electric-cars-secret-shopper-study-reveals/index.htm |archivedate=2017-01-30 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--"Still, even at the least knowledgeable dealership visited for this project, our secret shopper said they felt positive about the experience overall"--&gt;

In 2016, two shopper surveys showed contrasting shopping experiences between Tesla and traditional dealerships. One performed by the [[environmental organization]] [[Sierra Club]] found that in 14% of traditional dealerships, their electric cars were not charged to test drive, and 33% did not discuss [[Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States|$7,500 tax credits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2016/08/first-ever-multi-state-study-electric-vehicle-shopping-experience |title=First-Ever Multi-State Study on Electric Vehicle Shopping Experience|website=Sierra Club National |accessdate=2016-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mo2016-09/&gt;

Another study by industry analyst Pied Piper using mystery shoppers found that Tesla sales stores (not galleries) differed among each other on sales techniques, and many stores were reluctant to engage in [[Closing (sales)|closing a sale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wardsauto.com/dealer/mystery-shoppers-put-tesla-dealerships-cellar-again |title=Mystery Shoppers Put Tesla Dealerships in Cellar – Again|publisher=[[Ward's]] |accessdate=15 August 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160712124336/http://wardsauto.com/dealer/mystery-shoppers-put-tesla-dealerships-cellar-again |archivedate=2016-07-12 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Man from Earth''''' is a 2007 American [[drama film|drama]] [[science fiction film]] written by [[Jerome Bixby]] and directed by [[Richard Schenkman]]. It stars [[David Lee Smith]] as John Oldman, the protagonist. The screenplay was conceived by Jerome Bixby in the early 1960s and completed on his deathbed in April 1998.&lt;ref name = "promotional site"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Man From Earth (About) | work = Manfromearth.com | url = http://www.manfromearth.com/ManFromEarth-About.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228142327/http://www.manfromearth.com/ManFromEarth-About.html| archivedate=2012-12-28 | accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film gained recognition in part for being widely distributed through Internet [[peer-to-peer]] networks, which raised its profile.  The film was later adapted by Schenkman into a stage play of the same name.

The plot focuses on John Oldman, a departing university professor, who claims to be a [[Cro-Magnon]] (or [[Magdalenian]] caveman) who has secretly survived for more than 14,000 years. The entire film is set in and around Oldman's house during his farewell party and is composed almost entirely of dialogue. The plot advances through intellectual arguments between Oldman and his fellow faculty members.

==Plot==
Professor John Oldman is packing his belongings onto his truck, preparing to move to a new home. His colleagues show up to give him an impromptu farewell party: Harry, a biologist; Edith, an [[art history]] professor and devout [[Christian]]; Dan ([[Tony Todd]]), an [[anthropologist]]; Sandy, a [[historian]] who is in love with John; Dr. Will Gruber, a psychiatrist; Art, an archaeologist; and his student Linda.

As John's colleagues press him to explain the reason for his departure, he slowly, and somewhat reluctantly, reveals that he is a prehistoric [[caveman]] who has lived for more than 14 millennia, and that he relocates every ten years to keep others from realizing that [[immortality|he does not age]]. He begins his tale under the guise of a possible science-fiction story, but eventually stops speaking in hypotheticals and begins answering questions from a first-person perspective. His colleagues refuse to believe his story. John continues his tale, relating how he was a [[Sumer]]ian for 2000 years, a [[Babylonia]]n, and eventually went east to become a disciple of [[Gautama Buddha]]. He claims to have been given a chance to sail with [[Christopher Columbus]] (admitting that at the time he [[Myth of the flat Earth|still believed the earth was flat]]) and to have befriended [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] (one of whose original paintings he apparently owns, a gift from the artist himself).

In the course of the conversation, each of John's colleagues questions his story based on knowledge from his or her own academic specialty. Harry, the [[biologist]], struggles with how biology could allow for the possibility of a human being living for so long. Art, the [[archaeologist]], questions John about events in [[prehistory]]. He exclaims that John's answers, though correct, could have come from any textbook; John rejoins that, like any human, his memory is imperfect and he only sees events from his own narrow perspective, so he is not all-knowing. Will, the [[psychiatrist]], questions if John feels guilt for outliving everyone he has ever known and loved, and threatens John with a gun (which is later revealed to have been unloaded) before temporarily leaving.  John then learns from the group that Will's wife had died the previous day after a long illness.

The discussion turns to the topic of religion. John mentions that he is not a follower of a particular religion; though he does not necessarily believe in an omnipotent God, he does not discount the possibility of such a being's existence. Pressed by the group, John reluctantly reveals that in trying to take Buddha's teachings to the west, into the [[eastern Roman Empire]], he became the inspiration for the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|Jesus story]]. After this revelation, emotions in the room run high. Edith begins crying. Will demands that John end his tale and give the group a sense of closure by admitting it was all a hoax, and threatens to have John involuntarily committed for psychiatric evaluation should he refuse to do so. John appears to ruminate over his response before finally "confessing" to everyone that his story was a prank.

John's friends leave the party with various reactions: Edith is relieved; Harry and Dan indicate an open mind; Art never wants to see John again; Will still believes John is mad and still wants him committed; Sandy and Linda clearly believe John. After everyone else but Will and Sandy have left, Will overhears John and Sandy's conversation, which suggests the story could be true after all. John mentions some of the [[pseudonym]]s he has used over the years, and Will realizes one was his father's name. He asks John questions that only his father could answer and, when John does answer correctly, Will is shocked before having emotional breakdown, suffers a heart attack and dies in their arms. After the body has been taken away, Sandy realizes this is the first time John has seen one of his grown children die. John wordlessly gets in his truck and starts to drive to an unknown destination. Then he stops and waits for Sandy, who walks over to the truck.

==Play==
In 2012, Richard Schenkman adapted the film to a play, which received positive reviews.&lt;ref name="September 05, 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Isenberg|first=Robert|title=The Man From Earth|url=http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/the-man-from-earth/Content?oid=1561929|accessdate=2 June 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh City Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater play was also staged in Greece in 2013 [https://www.athinorama.gr/theatre/performance/the_man_from_earth-10030474.html].

==Sequels==
{{main article|The Man from Earth: Holocene}}
A sequel, ''[[The Man from Earth: Holocene]]'' was released in 2017. Filming began on June 2, 2016 and ended on June 16. The producers have stated on Facebook that it may be the first in a series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ManFromEarthHolocene/|title=The Man From Earth: Holocene {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This followed two previous attempts at producing sequels. A [[Kickstarter]] campaign to crowdfund a sequel named ''The Man From Earth II: Man From Earth Millennium'' was announced in September 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/man-earth-ii-man-earth-millennium-launches-kickstarter-campaign/|title=The Man From Earth II: Man From Earth Millennium Launches Kickstarter Campaign|last=Lowe|first=Alexander|work=We Got This Covered|date=2013-10-02|accessdate=2015-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not able to collect the minimum-required supporting by October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1759006687/the-man-from-earth-ii-man-from-earth-millennium|title=The Man From Earth II: Man From Earth Millennium|work=[[Kickstarter]]|accessdate=2015-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another attempt was then made to crowdfund a series, ''Man From Earth: The Series'', based on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/man-from-earth-the-series-kickstarter-campaign/|title=Man From Earth: The Series Gets A Kickstarter Campaign|last=Lowe|first=Alexander|work=We Got This Covered|date=2014-07-24|accessdate=2015-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second crowd-funding effort completed successfully in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1759006687/man-from-earth-the-series/posts/960935|title=Kickstarter campaign for Man from Earth the Series|work=[[Kickstarter]]|accessdate=2015-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">In [[phonology]], the '''ts–ch merger''' is the [[merger (phonology)|merger]] of the [[voiceless alveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/ts/}} and the [[voiceless postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/tʃ/}}.

In [[Russian language|Russian]], it is the merger of the consonants rendered by letters [[Che (Cyrillic)|Che]] and [[Tse (Cyrillic)|Tse]]. If the shift is towards Tse, it is called ''tsokanye'' ({{lang-ru|цоканье}}); the shift towards Che is called ''chokanye'' ({{lang-ru|чоканье}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philol.msu.ru/~dialect/pict/color_16s.gif|accessdate=|language=ru|title=Карта.

In [[Polish language]] the {{IPA|/tʃ/ → /ts/}} merger is part of a more general [[dialect]]al feature called ''[[Mazurzenie]]''  present in many Polish dialects, named for the [[Masovian dialect]].&lt;ref name=koerner&gt;Stanislaw Gogolewski, "Dialectology in Poland, 1873-1997",  In: ''Towards a History of Linguistics in Poland'', by E.

It also occurs in a few areas of the Chakavian dialect of [[Croatian language|Croatian]], known as ''[[Chakavian dialect#Non-palatal tsakavism|tsakavism]]''.

The ''[[sabesdiker losn]]'' feature of [[Northeastern Yiddish]] includes the {{IPA|/tʃ/ → /ts/}} merger.

[[File:Westford Knight detail.JPG|200px|right|thumb|A detail of the rock, showing the "sword". The "shield" has been painted on, supposedly to indicate an underlying carving]]

'''"Westford Knight"''' is the name given to a pattern, variously interpreted as a carving or a natural feature, or a combination of both, located on a glacial boulder (also known as the '''Sinclair Rock''')  in [[Westford, Massachusetts|Westford]], [[Massachusetts]] in the United States.

It is notable for being the subject of popular or [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]] speculation on [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories|Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]. The pattern was first described as a possible Native American carving in 1873. The identification as a "medieval knight" dates to 1954.

==Early references==
The rock and carving is first mentioned in print in an 1873 addition of the "Gazetteer of Massachusetts" and was described as "There upon its face a rude figure, supposed to have been cut by some Indian Artist."&lt;ref&gt;Gazetteer of Massachusetts, 1873 page 542&lt;/ref&gt;  In an 1883 town history, the carving is described as "A broad ledge which crops out near the house of William Kitteredge has upon its surface grooves made by glaciers. Rude outlines of the human face have been traced upon it, and the figure is said to be the work of Indians."&lt;ref&gt;Reverend Edwin R. Hodgman, ''History of the Town of Westford, Mass 1659–1883'' (Lowell, Mass.: Westford Town History Association, 1883).&lt;/ref&gt; The carving was subsequently identified as a broken Norse Sword by William Goodwin in his book on the [[America's Stonehenge]] site.&lt;ref&gt;William B. Goodwin, ''The Ruins of Great Ireland in New England'' (Boston: Meador Publishing Company, 1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Glynn, president of the Archaeological Society of Connecticut, re-located the carving and following discussions with [[T. C. Lethbridge]] about Goodwin's theory, chalked in a full figure in 1954, resembling a medieval knight, with a sword and shield, and he is usually said to be the "discoverer of the Westford Knight."&lt;ref&gt;For example, in Richard White, ''These Stones Bear Witness'', page 93 (Anchor House, 2010). {{ISBN|978-1-4520-1718-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Lethbridge who suggested to Glynn that the sword was not of Viking origin, but was "a hand-and-a-half wheel pommel sword" common in 14th century North Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Richard White, pages 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary pseudoarchaeology==
The current{{year needed|date=February 2015}} interpretation by those who advocate that the feature on the rock is a human figure is that it commemorates a fallen member of the party of [[Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney|Henry Sinclair]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] Earl from [[Orkney]], whom some believe to have made a voyage to the New World in 1398, traveling to [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New England]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Wallace-Murphy, Marilyn Hopkins ''Templars in America: From the Crusades to the New World'' (Weiser Books, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Raymond Ramsey in 1972, the shield carried by the knight in the image was found to support this belief, when "English heraldic experts consulted by Lethbridge definitely identified arms on the shield as belonging to the Sinclairs of Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;Raymond H. Ramsey, ''No Longer on the Map: Discovering Places That Never Were'', pages 65-66 (New York: The Viking Press, 1972). {{ISBN|0-6705-1433-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually{{clarify|date=February 2015}} it is claimed that the knight is [[James Gunn (explorer)|Sir James Gunn]], a member of [[Clan Gunn]] and a [[Knights Templar|Knight Templar]] who reportedly traveled with Sinclair.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Sora, ''The Lost Colony of The Templars: Verrazano's Secret Mission To America'', page 161 (Destiny Books, 2004). {{ISBN|978-1-59477-870-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument next to the "knight" commemorates this interpretation, stating as fact that Sinclair and his party traveled to present-day [[Massachusetts]]. Believers in this theory often{{clarify|date=February 2015}} cite the [[Newport Tower (Rhode Island)|Newport Tower]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] as further evidence to support their claim.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]], [[Robert Lomas]], ''[[The Hiram Key]]: Pharaohs, Freemasons and The Discovery of The Secret Scrolls of Jesus'' (London: Century, 1996). {{ISBN|0-7126-8579-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has no credibility in scholarship.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} It was mentioned in an ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth L. Feder]], ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The Walam Olum'', pages 270-271 (Greenwood, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-313-37919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent{{year needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;This surfaced in 1995 and never went to print&lt;/ref&gt; investigation of the rock by David K. Schafer, Curatorial Assistant for Archaeology at the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] at [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramtops.co.uk/westford.html|title=The Westford Knight Revealed|work=ramtops.co.uk|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that except for the "sword handle", which is definitely a punch carving, the entire feature consists of naturally formed scratches caused by glaciation. The local town historian of Westford{{who|date=February 2015}}{{year needed|date=February 2015}} has stated that there is evidence that the T-shaped inscription was made in the late 19th century. There are some historians{{who|date=February 2015}} who believe that the area around the rock has undergone erosion since the clearing of trees in the 18th century, and that during the time of the alleged voyage by Sinclair, the rock may have been in a hardwood forest covered by {{convert|3|or|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} of earth.{{refimprove-inline|date=April 2016}} There are some historians{{who|date=February 2015}} who claim that the timing is inconsistent with documented history, as at the time of the alleged voyage (1398), the Order of the Knights Templar was not in existence, having been publicly disbanded ninety years earlier.

'''Zecharia Sitchin''' (July 11, 1920 – October 9, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitchin.com/ |title=The Official Web Site of Zecharia Sitchin |publisher=Sitchin.com |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an author of books proposing an explanation for [[human]] origins involving [[ancient astronauts]]. Sitchin attributed the creation of the ancient [[Sumer]]ian culture to the ''[[Anunnaki]]'', which he stated was a race of [[extraterrestrials]] from a [[planet beyond Neptune]] called ''Nibiru''.  He asserted that [[Sumerian mythology]] suggests that this hypothetical planet of Nibiru is in an elongated, 3,600-year-long elliptical orbit around the [[sun]]. Sitchin's books have sold millions of copies worldwide and have been translated into more than 25 languages.

Sitchin's ideas have been rejected by scientists and academics, who dismiss his work as [[pseudoscience]] and [[pseudohistory]]. His work has been criticized for flawed methodology and mistranslations of ancient texts as well as for incorrect astronomical and scientific claims.&lt;ref name="Skepdic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/sitchin.html|title=Zecharia Sitchin and ''The Earth Chronicles''|last=Carroll|first=Robert T|date=1994–2009|work=The Skeptic's Dictionary|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Sitchin was born in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan SSR]] and raised in [[Mandatory Palestine]]. He received a degree in economics from the [[University of London]], and was an editor and journalist in [[Mandatory Palestine]] (which in 1948 became the modern state of [[Israel]]), before moving to [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1952. While working as an executive for a shipping company, he taught himself [[Sumerian cuneiform]] and visited several archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="NYT, Kilgannon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=X DOESN'T MARK THE SPOT IS THERE A PLANET X THAT WILL CAUSE GLOBAL CATASTROPHE NEXT MAY?|author=Phil Plait|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/232461161.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+05%2C+2002&amp;author=Phil+Plait%2C+Globe+Correspondent&amp;pub=Boston+Globe&amp;desc=X+DOESN%27T+MARK+THE+SPOT+IS+THERE+A+PLANET+X+THAT+WILL+CAUSE+GLOBAL+CATASTROPHE+NEXT+MAY%3F&amp;pqatl=google|publisher=Globe and Mail|date=2003|accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas and works==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}

Similar to earlier authors such as [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and [[Erich von Däniken]], Sitchin advocated hypotheses in which extraterrestrial events supposedly played a significant role in ancient human history.

According to Sitchin's interpretation of Mesopotamian iconography and symbolism, outlined in his 1976 book ''The 12th Planet'' and its sequels, there is an undiscovered planet [[planets beyond Neptune|beyond Neptune]] that follows a long, elliptical orbit, reaching the inner solar system roughly every 3,600 years. This planet is called Nibiru (although [[Jupiter]] was the planet associated with the god [[Marduk]] in [[Babylonia]]n cosmology).&lt;ref&gt;Jastrow, Jr., Morris (1911). ''Aspects of Religious Belief and Practice in Babylonia and Assyria'', G.P. Putnam's Sons: New York and London. pp. 217-219.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sitchin, Nibiru (whose name was replaced with MARDUK in original legends by the Babylonian ruler of the same name in an attempt to co-opt the creation for himself, leading to some confusion among readers) collided [[catastrophism|catastrophically]] with [[Tiamat]] (a goddess in the Babylonian creation myth the ''[[Enûma Eliš]]''), which he considers to be another planet once located between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. This collision supposedly formed the planet Earth, the [[asteroid belt]], and the [[comet]]s. Sitchin states that when struck by one of planet Nibiru's moons, Tiamat split in two, and then on a second pass Nibiru itself struck the broken fragments and one half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt. The second half, struck again by one of Nibiru's moons, was pushed into a new orbit and became today's planet Earth.

According to Sitchin, Nibiru (called "the twelfth planet" because, Sitchin claimed, the [[Sumer]]ians' gods-given conception of the Solar System counted all eight planets, plus Pluto, the Sun and the Moon) was the home of a technologically advanced human-like [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] race called the ''[[Anunnaki]]'' in [[Sumerian myth]], who Sitchin states are called the ''[[Nephilim]]'' in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. He wrote that they evolved after Nibiru entered the solar system, and they first arrived on Earth probably 450,000 years ago, looking for minerals, especially [[gold]], which they found and mined in [[Africa]]. Sitchin states that these "gods" were the rank-and-file workers of the colonial expedition to Earth from planet Nibiru.

According to Sitchin, [[Enki]] (the Sumerian god of water and human culture) suggested that to relieve the Anunnaki, who had mutinied over their dissatisfaction with their working conditions, that primitive workers (''[[Homo sapiens]]'') be created by [[genetic engineering]] as slaves to replace them in the gold mines by crossing extraterrestrial genes with those of ''[[Homo erectus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sitchin|first=Zecharia|title=The Wars of Gods and Men: Book III of the Earth Chronicles|date=2007|publisher=Harper|isbn=978-0-06-137927-7|pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sitchin|first=Zecharia|title=Genesis Revisited|date=1990|publisher=Avon|isbn=978-0-380-76159-3|pages=157–182, chapter "The Adam: A Slave Made to Order}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sitchin, ancient inscriptions report that the human civilization in [[Sumer]], [[Mesopotamia]], was set up under the guidance of these "gods", and human [[monarchy|kingship]] was inaugurated to provide intermediaries between mankind and the Anunnaki (creating the "[[divine right of kings]]" doctrine). Sitchin believes that [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] from [[nuclear weapon]]s, used during a war between factions of the extraterrestrials, is the "evil wind" described in the [[Lament for Ur]] that destroyed [[Ur]] around 2000 BC. Sitchin states the exact year is 2024 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitchin.com/evilwind.htm |title=Evil Wind web page |publisher=Sitchin.com |date=2001-04-27 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sitchin says that his research coincides with many [[biblical]] texts, and that biblical texts come originally from [[Sumerian literature|Sumerian writings]].

According to some writers, Sitchin's ideas, along with those of Erich von Däniken may have influenced the beliefs of the religious sect of [[Raëlism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genta|first=Giancarlo|title=Lonely Minds in the Universe: The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence |date=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-33925-2|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colavito|first=Jason|title=The cult of alien gods: H.P.

The 1994 movie ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', directed by [[Roland Emmerich]], and the 2009 video game ''[[The Conduit]]'' drew some conceptual inspiration from Sitchin's ideas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conduit's Storyline|publisher=IGN|url=http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/963/963610p2.html|date=2009|accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, 2003, ''Stargate, Ultimate Edition'', MGM DVD&lt;/ref&gt; while screenwriter [[Roberto Orci]] says the villains of the film ''[[Cowboys &amp; Aliens]]'' were inspired by Sitchin's conceptualization of the Anunnaki as gold-mining aliens.&lt;ref name=Gold&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Chitwood |url=http://www.superherohype.com/features/articles/110995-cowboys-a-aliens-set-visit |title=Cowboys &amp; Aliens Set Visit |publisher=[[Superhero Hype!]] |date= 2010-11-29 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Lorin Morgan-Richards]]' theatrical performance of ''ENKI'', based on the writings of Zecharia Sitchin, premiered in Cleveland, Ohio under the choreography of Michael Medcalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/winter-music-conference/Content?oid=1474000|title=Winter Music Conference|author=|date=|work=clevescene.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Kazem Finjan, the Iraqi Minister of Transport, claimed at a press conference that [[Sumer]]ians had built and used an airport in the [[Dhi Qar Governorate]] to launch spaceships from 5000 years ago. He cited the work of Sitchin and others to support his assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/first-airport-on-earth-iraq_us_57fbb625e4b068ecb5e05fed?section=us_weird-news|title=ETs Built Earth's First Airport, Iraqi Transport Minister Says|author=Lee Speigel|date=13 October 2016|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Criticism of Sitchin's work falls primarily into three categories: translations and interpretations of ancient texts, astronomical and scientific observations, and literalism of myth.

===Translations and interpretations===
When Sitchin wrote his books, only specialists could read the Sumerian language. However, sources such as the 2006 book ''Sumerian Lexicon''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halloran|first=John A.|date=2006 |title=''Sumerian Lexicon: A Dictionary Guide to the Ancient Sumerian Language''|publisher=The David Brown Book Company|isbn=0-9786429-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; have made the language more accessible to non-experts.

American biblical scholar [[Michael S. Heiser]] states he has found many inaccuracies in Sitchin's translations and challenges interested parties to use this book to check their validity.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/199/zechariah_sitchin.html Zechariah Sitchin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117164717/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/199/zechariah_sitchin.html |date=2007-11-17 }}, [[Mark Pilkington (writer)|Mark Pilkington]], ''[[Fortean Times]]'', August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitchiniswrong.com/anunnaki/anunnaki.htm|title=Anunnaki|author=|date=|work=sitchiniswrong.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. [[Ronald H. Fritze]],&lt;ref name="corndancer.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corndancer.com/fritze/fritzebio.html|title=Ron Fritze's Bio|author=|date=|work=corndancer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; author of the book ''Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-religions'',&lt;ref name="corndancer.com"/&gt; mentions the example of Sitchin's claim that the Sumerian sign ''[[Dingir|DIĜIR]]'' means "pure ones of the blazing rockets", adding that "Sitchin's assignment of meanings to ancient words is tendentious and frequently strained."&lt;ref name="Fritze, Ronald H 2009 p214"&gt;Fritze, Ronald H,. (2009). Invented knowledge: false history, fake science and pseudo-religions. Reaktion Books. p. 214. {{ISBN|978-1-86189-430-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritze also commented on Sitchin's methodology, writing that "When critics have checked Sitchin's references, they have found that he frequently quotes out of context or truncates his quotes in a way that distorts evidence in order to prove his contentions. Evidence is presented selectively and contradictory evidence is ignored."&lt;ref name="Fritze, Ronald H 2009 p214"/&gt;

Sitchin bases his arguments on his personal interpretations of pre-Nubian and Sumerian texts, and the seal VA 243. Sitchin wrote that these ancient civilizations knew of a twelfth planet, when in fact they only knew five.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelsheiser.com/va_243%20page.htm |title=The Myth of a 12th Planet in Sumero-Mesopotamian Astronomy: A Study of Cylinder Seal VA 243 by Dr. Michael S. Heiser |publisher=Michaelsheiser.com |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of Sumerian astronomical seals and calendars have been decoded and recorded, and the total count of planets on each seal has been five. Seal VA 243 has 12 dots that Sitchin identifies as planets. When translated, seal VA 243 reads "You're his Servant" which is now thought to be a message from a nobleman to a servant. According to Heiser, the so-called sun on Seal VA 243 is not the Sumerian symbol for the sun but is a star, and the dots are also stars.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelsheiser.com/VA243seal.pdf |title=The Myth of a 12th Planet |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol on seal VA 243 has no resemblance to the hundreds of documented Sumerian sun symbols.

In a 1979 review of ''The Twelfth Planet'', Roger W. Wescott,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velikovsky.info/Roger_W._Wescott |title=Roger W. Wescott - The Velikovsky Encyclopedia |publisher=Velikovsky.info |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Anthropology and Linguistics at [[Drew University]], Madison, New Jersey, noted Sitchin's amateurishness with respect to the primacy of the Sumerian language:

{{quote|Sitchin's linguistics seems at least as amateurish as his anthropology, biology, and astronomy. On p. 370, for example, he maintains that "all the ancient languages ... including early Chinese ... stemmed from one primeval source -- Sumerian". Sumerian, of course, is the virtual archetype of what linguistic taxonomists call a [[Language isolate|language-isolate]], meaning a language that does not fall into any of the well-known language-families or exhibit clear cognation with any known language. Even if Sitchin is referring to written rather than to spoken language, it is unlikely that his contention can be persuasively defended, since Sumerian ideograms were preceded by the Azilian and Tartarian signaries of Europe as well as by a variety of script-like notational systems between the Nile and Indus rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Wescott, Roger W. 1979. ''Kronos'' Vol. IV, No. 4, pp. 90-92.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Astronomical and scientific observations===

Sitchin's "planetary collision" hypothesis does superficially resemble one suggested by modern [[astronomer]]s—the [[giant impact hypothesis]] of the [[Moon]]'s formation about 4.5 billion years ago by a body impacting with the newly formed Earth. However, Sitchin's proposed series of rogue planetary collisions differ in both details and timing. As with [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s earlier ''Worlds in Collision'' thesis, Sitchin states that he has found evidence of ancient human knowledge of rogue celestial motions in a variety of mythological accounts. In Velikovsky's case, these interplanetary collisions were supposed to have taken place within the span of human existence, whereas for Sitchin these occurred during the early stages of planetary formation, but entered the mythological account passed down via the alien race which purportedly evolved on Nibiru after these encounters.

According to former Immanuel Velikovsky assistant turned prolific critic, C. Leroy Ellenberger,&lt;ref name="velikovsky.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velikovsky.info/C._Leroy_Ellenberger|title=C. Leroy Ellenberger - The Velikovsky Encyclopedia|author=|date=|work=velikovsky.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[Sitchin states that] from an equal start, the Nephilim evolved on Nibiru 45 million years ahead of comparable development on Earth with its decidedly more favorable environment. Such an outcome is unlikely, to say the least, since Nibiru would spend over 99% of its time beyond Pluto. Sitchin's explanation that heat from radioactive decay and a thick atmosphere keep Nibiru warm is absurd and does not address the problem of darkness in deep space. Also unexplained is how the Nephilim, who evolved long after Nibiru arrived, knew what happened when Nibiru first entered the solar system."&lt;ref name="Ellenberger, C 1981. pp. 3-4" /&gt;

The scenario outlined by Sitchin, with Nibiru returning to the inner solar system regularly every 3,600 years,

&lt;blockquote&gt;... implies an orbit with a semi-major axis of 235 [[astronomical units]], extending from the asteroid belt to twelve times farther beyond the sun than Pluto. Elementary perturbation theory indicates that, under the most favorable circumstances of avoiding close encounters with other planets, no body with such an eccentric orbit would keep the same period for two consecutive passages. Within twelve orbits the object would be either ejected or converted to a short period object. Thus, the failed search for a trans-Plutonian planet by [[Tom Van Flandern|T.C. Van Flandern]], of the U.S. Naval Observatory, which Sitchin uses to bolster his thesis, is no support at all.&lt;ref name="Ellenberger, C 1981. pp. 3-4"&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, C. Leroy]] 1981. Marduk Unmasked. ''Frontiers of Science'', May–June, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sitchin in "the case of Adam's alien genes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitchin.com/adam.htm |title=the case of Adam's alien genes |publisher=Sitchin.com |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that 223 genes found by the Human Genome Sequencing Consortium are without the required predecessors on the genomic evolutionary tree. Later researchers have argued that the conclusion from the Human Genome Sequencing Consortium cannot be drawn due to a lack of a comprehensive gene database for comparison. An analysis by [[Steven Salzberg|Salzberg]] identified 40 potential genes laterally transferred into the genome from prokaryotic organisms. Salzberg also argues that gene loss combined with sample size effects and evolutionary rate variation provide an alternative, more biologically plausible explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Salzberg, Steven L., Owen White, et al. "Microbial Genes in the Human Genome: Lateral Transfer or Gene Loss?". Science 292.5523 (2001): 1903 – 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literalism of myth===

[[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]], co-author of the controversial book ''Centuries of Darkness'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centuries.co.uk/|title=Centuries of Darkness by Peter James, I. J. Thorpe, Nikos Kokkinos, Robert Morkot &amp; John Frankish|author=|date=|work=centuries.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; has criticized Sitchin both for ignoring the world outside [[Mesopotamia]] and more specifically for misunderstanding [[Babylonian literature]]:

{{quote|He uses the Epic of Creation [[Enuma Elish]] as the foundation for his [[cosmogony]], identifying the young god Marduk, who overthrows the older regime of gods and creates the Earth, as the unknown "Twelfth Planet". In order to do this he interprets the Babylonian [[theogony]] as a factual account of the birth of the other "eleven" planets. The Babylonian names for the planets are established beyond a shadow of a doubt—[[Ishtar]] was the deity of Venus, [[Nergal]] of Mars, and Marduk of Jupiter—and confirmed by hundreds of astronomical/astrological tables and treatises on clay tablets and papyri from the Hellenistic period. Sitchin merrily ignores all this and assigns unwarranted planetary identities to the gods mentioned in the theogony. For example, [[Abzu|Apsu]], attested as god of the primeval waters, becomes, of all things, the Sun! [[Enki|Ea]], as it suits Sitchin, is sometimes planet Neptune and sometimes a spaceman. And the identity of Ishtar as the planet Venus, a central feature of Mesopotamian religion, is nowhere mentioned in the book—instead Sitchin arbitrarily assigns to Venus another deity from ''Enuma Elish'', and reserves Ishtar for a role as a female astronaut.&lt;ref&gt;James, Peter ''SIS Workshop'' no. 7, vol. 2, no. 2 (Nov. 1979), reprinted from ''Fortean Times'' no. 27 (Nov. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[William Irwin Thompson]] comments on what he calls Sitchin's 'literalism':

{{quote|What Sitchin sees is what he needs for his hypothesis. So figure 15 on page 40 is radiation therapy, and figure 71 on page 136 is a god inside a rocket-shaped chamber. If these are gods, why are they stuck with our cheap B movie technology of rockets, microphones, space-suits, and radiation therapy? If they are gods, then why can't they have some really divine technology such as intradimensional worm-hole travel, antigravity, starlight propulsion, or black hole bounce rematerializations? Sitchin has constructed what appears to be a convincing argument, but when he gets close to single images on ancient tablets, he falls back into the literalism of "Here is an image of the gods in rockets." Suddenly, ancient Sumer is made to look like the movie set for ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]''. Erich Von Däniken's potboiler ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' has the same problem. [[Nazca plains]] in Peru is turned into a World War II landing strip. The gods can cross galactic distances, but by the time they get to Peru, their spaceships are imagined as World War II prop jobs that need an enormous landing strip. This literalization of the imagination doesn't make any sense, but every time it doesn't, you hear Sitchin say "There can be no doubt, but ... "&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, William Irwin ''Coming into being: artifacts and texts in the evolution of consciousness'' pp.75-76 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YJyF-zbTzo4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=%22william+irwin+thompson%22+sitchin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IeqW0AjqMd&amp;sig=p63cF5VrYbepzHJVZ8DIrgJ3TTM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ucQhS_i6DomSNsC46esJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20%20sitchin&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A '''Zone naturelle d'intérêt écologique, faunistique et floristique''' (Natural zone of ecological interest, fauna and flora), abbreviated as '''ZNIEFF''', is a type of natural environment recognized by [[France]].

The inventory of a ZNIEFF area is an inventory of natural resources and scientific program launched in 1982 by Minister of Environment [[Huguette Bouchardeau]] and confirmed by the Act of July 12, 1983 called the Bouchardeau act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000692490 |title=Loi n°83-630 du 12 juillet 1983 relative à la démocratisation des enquêtes publiques et à la protection de l'environnement |language=French |trans-title=Law No. 83-630 of 12 July 1983 on the democratization of public inquiries and environmental protection |date=Jan 2001|publisher=Legifrance |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ZNIEFF is not a measure of regulatory protection, but an inventory. It corresponds to the census of outstanding natural land areas in the twenty-two metropolitan areas as well as the overseas departments of France. The designation of a ZNIEFF based primarily on the presence of species or groups of species with strong heritage interest. The presence of at least one population of critical species ([[:fr:espèce déterminante]] in French) defines a ZNIEFF.

This is one of the bases for prioritizing natural heritage issues as part of the [[:fr:Stratégies régionales pour la biodiversité|National Biodiversity Strategy]], or [[:fr:Stratégies régionales pour la biodiversité|Regional Biodiversity Strategies]],  [[:fr:Stratégie nationale de création d'aires protégées|National Strategy for creation of protected areas]] (SCAP), etc. It is used for [[environmental impact assessment]]. The Belgian equivalent of the ZNIEFF is the [[:fr:Site de grand intérêt biologique|Site of Biological Interest]] (SGIB).

== History ==
* The program was launched in 1982 by the Direction de la protection de la nature (Department of Conservation) (now Direction de la nature et des paysages (Department of Nature and Countryside) of the [[Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy]], with the support of the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|French National Museum of Natural History]]; The goal of this undertaking was to produce an inventory for the entire country, areas of greater ''ecological interest'' "primarily from the perspective of the Department provide a tool for decision support"&lt;!-- ref name=Guide2004 / --&gt; (translated).
* The scientific validatino of the nature inventories in each region by the Regional Scientific Council of the natural heritage (CSRPN) and nationally by the National Museum of Natural History constitute the heart of the national Inventory of natural Heritage;
* In 1984, the Overseas Department was added to the inventory;
* 1987: 1st publication of an informative brochure and outreach entitled "''Notre Patrimoine Naturel''" (Our Natural Heritage), on the inventory, with a map scaled at 1:250000 of ZNIEFFs of each region (in 1995, 20 of the 22 metropolitan regions have published such a document, but other atlases and ZNIEFF maps, thematic maps, municipal and platelets extension forms will be published in the regions;
* In March 1990 the National Museum of Natural History is a point on the inventory at a symposium entitled "''ZNIEFF, an opportunity to negotiate, towards a network of managed natural areas''";
* In 1991, ZNIEFF was adapted for marine environments, with the first phase ending between 1988 and 1995.
* In May 1991, a circular to regional prefect, explained the notion of ZNIEFF indicating the partners involved and specifying the legal scope of the inventory as well as how to access the data. Circular consolidates the former ZNIEFF committees, creating Regional Scientific Councils on Natural Heritage (CSRPN) and creating the positions assistant prefects, under the aegis of [[:fr:Direction régionale de l'Environnement]] (Regional Directors of the Environment) to control and validate the inventory of each region.
* In 1993, the [[:fr:Loi Paysage|Countryside Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=Loi Paysage |number=93-24 |language=French |date= 8 January 1993 |article=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the State may decide to develop local and regional inventories of fauna and flora heritage. The local authorities are aware of this development. These inventories are studied under the scientific responsibility of the National Museum of Natural History." (translated)
* In 1993, The ZNIEFFs allow production of the preliminary inventory to the implementation of the European Directive No. 92-43 on the conservation of natural and semi-natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora so-called "Habitats Directive-Fauna-Flora".
* In late 1994, a phase of "modernization of ZNIEFF" was officially launched by the Directorate of nature and countryside. There is talk of a "second generation" inventory;
* 1995: Launch of a ZNIEFF updated with a modernized and refined method (following a seminar of the National Working Committee ZNIEFF and national and regional partners in the inventory, which was held in Paris on 15 November 1994);
* In 1997 [[:fr:Institut français de l'environnement|French Institute for the Environment]] and [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|National Museum of Natural History]] jointly produced at the request of the Ministry of Environment, the first ''methodological guide'' clarifying definitions and coordinating and harmonizing regional approaches, which still varied widely. The development of more efficient and less expensive computer tools enabled data processing to facilitate the harmonization of regional inventories primarily driven by Volunteers, under the direction of DRAE (Regional Directorates of architecture and Environment (now since [[:fr:Direction régionale de l'Environnement|Regional Directorate for the Environment]] and [[:fr:Direction régionale de l'environnement, de l'aménagement et du logement|Regional Directorate of Environment, Planning and Housing]]); 
* The law of 27 February 2002 on grassroots democracy created the [[:fr:Inventaire national du patrimoine naturel|National inventory of natural heritage]] entrusted to the Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |language=French |date=27 February 2002 |article= L. 411-5-III}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Article L. 411-5 III of the Code of environment places the responsibility for the scientific coordination of inventory natural heritage programs in MNHN and strengthens CSRPN ([[:fr:Conseils scientifiques régionaux du patrimoine naturel|Regional Scientific Councils Natural Heritage]]), allowing in particular, under certain conditions, access to the [[private property]] to complete the inventory, even though Europe also imposed more accurate inventories in part of the 'Habitats' Directive or the Water Directive ([[wetlands]], GES ...);
* In 2004, under the leadership of the Museum, the concept of "[[:fr:espèce déterminante|critical species]]" was becoming increasingly important, to play a major role in the new characterization ZNIEFF (made by crossing on a scientific basis and biogeographic criteria of rarity, [[endangered species]] of [[:fr:Espèce protégée|protected status]] of [[:fr:autochtone|native species]] and [[endemism]]). The method of delimitation of boundaries is refined to be ''clear and indisputable''.&lt;ref name="Guide2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elissalde-Videment |first1=L. |last2=Horellou |first2=A. |last3=Humbert |first3=G. |last4=Moret |first4=J. |date=2004 |title=Guide méthodologique sur la modernisation de l'inventaire des zones naturelles d'intérêt écologique, faunistique et floristique |trans-title=Methodological guide on upgrading the inventory of natural areas of ecological interest, flora and fauna |url=http://inpn.mnhn.fr/docs/guideCorrectGrpe-bis_14_09_2004.pdf |language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle |accessdate=1 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
There are two types of zones:
* The ZNIEFF type I zones, of a small area, are consistent from an ecological point of view and areas that have at least one species and/or rare or threatened habitat, interest both local and regional, national or communal; or these are areas of great ''functional interest'' to the local ecological functioning.
* The ZNIEFF type II zones have great rich natural interest, or slightly modified, which offer important biological potential. They may include areas of type I and have a functional as well as ecological and countryside consistency role.

An inventory ''ZNIEFF second generation'' was launched in 1996, consisting of an update with harmonization of the methods of carrying out the inventory, better integrating some criteria ''feature'' of [[ecosystem]].

Up to 9 April 2013, ZNIEFFs were upgraded and validated for the following territories: [[Limousin]], [[Normandy]] (Upper and Lower), [[Champagne-Ardenne]], [[Picardie]], [[Pays-de-la-Loire]], [[Poitou-Charentes]], [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]], [[Rhône-Alpes]], [[Centre (French region)|Center]], [[Corsica]], [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], [[Ile-de-France]] (excluding Seine-et-Marne), [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]], [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], [[Lot-et-Garonne]], [[Guyana]] and [[Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inpn.mnhn.fr/actualites/lire/1021/la-franche-comte-et-la-lorraine-en-znieff-de-deuxieme-generation |title=La Franche-Comté et la Lorraine en ZNIEFF de deuxième génération |language=French |trans-title=Franche-Comté and Lorraine ZNIEFF second generation  |date=9 April 2013  |publisher=Inventaire National du Patrimoine Naturel |accessdate=1 November 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
This inventory is, in addition to an instrument of knowledge, one of the major elements of French [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] policy and taking into account the environment and [[spatial planning]] ([[green belt]], [[ecological network]] (including [[European green infrastructure]]), protective measures, [[environmental mitigation]], etc.) and in some projects creating protected areas (including [[nature reserve]]s) or in the development of ''departmental career paths'' for the operation of conglomerates.

French jurisprudence confirms that it is not creating an inventory for measuring regulatory protection and does not prohibit planning. However, it must be included in all the accompanying planning documents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espaces-naturels.info/node/926 |title=Quel statut pour les Znieff? |author=Florence Clap |language=French |trans-title=What is the Status of ZNIEFF? |date=April 2006 |publisher=Revue des Professionelles del la Nature |accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
