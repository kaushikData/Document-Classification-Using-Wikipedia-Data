'''''After the Deluge''''', also known as '''''The Forty-First Day''''',{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=233}} is a [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] [[oil painting]] by English artist [[George Frederic Watts]], first exhibited as '''''The Sun''''' in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows a scene from the story of [[Genesis flood narrative|Noah's Flood]], in which after 40 days of rain [[Noah]] opens the window of [[Noah's Ark|his Ark]] to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting takes the form of a stylised [[seascape]], dominated by a bright [[sunburst]] breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in ''The Genius of Greek Poetry'' in 1878, ''After the Deluge'' took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.

The unfinished painting was exhibited in [[Whitechapel]] in 1886, under the intentionally simplified title of ''The Sun''. Watts worked on the painting for a further five years, and the completed version was exhibited for the first time at the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]] in 1891. Between 1902 and 1906 the painting was exhibited around the United Kingdom, and it is now in the collection of the [[Watts Gallery]] in [[Compton, Guildford|Compton]], Surrey. As Watts did not include ''After the Deluge'' in his gift to the nation of what he considered his most significant works, it is not among his better-known paintings. However, it was greatly admired by many of Watts's fellow artists, and has been cited as an influence on numerous other painters who worked in the two decades following its initial exhibition.

==Background==
[[File:George Frederic Watts by George Frederic Watts.jpg|right|thumb|upright|George Frederic Watts, c.&amp;nbsp;1879|alt=elderly bearded man]]
[[George Frederic Watts]] was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=20}} His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=20}} Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=21}} At the age of 18 he gained admission to the [[Royal Academy schools]], although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=22}} From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=23}}

In 1843 he travelled to Italy where he remained for four years.{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}} On his return to London he suffered from [[melancholia]], and painted many notably gloomy works.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=29}} His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=33}} His portraits were extremely highly regarded,{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=33}} and in 1867 he was elected to the [[Royal Academy]], at the time the highest honour available to an artist,{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}}{{efn-ua|In Watts's time, honours such as knighthoods were only bestowed on presidents of major institutions, not otherwise on even the most well respected artists.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=135}} In 1885 serious consideration was given to raising Watts to the peerage; had this happened, he would have been the first artist thus honoured.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=69}} In the same year, he refused the offer of a [[baronetcy]].{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}}}} although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=40}} From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects;{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}} by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=xi}} In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at [[Little Holland House]], which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=42}}

''After the Deluge'' depicts a scene from the story of [[Genesis flood narrative|Noah's Flood]], in which [[Noah]] opens the window of [[Noah's Ark|the Ark]] to see that after forty days the rain has ended, but that the floodwaters have not yet subsided.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}} Although his father's strict [[evangelical Christianity]] had instilled in Watts a strong dislike of organised religion, he had a deep knowledge of the Bible,{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=20}} and Noah and the Flood were both themes he regularly depicted throughout his career.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}} 

Watts had a strong belief in the idea that modern society was prioritising wealth over social values, and that this attitude, which he described as "the hypocritical veiling of the daily sacrifice made to this deity",{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}} was leading to the decline of society.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=230}} Hilary Underwood of the [[University of Surrey]] writes that Watts likely painted so many works on the theme of Noah as he saw modern parallels with the notion of the cleaning of a degenerate society while preserving those who still adhered to moral standards.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}} Watts chose to depict the moment at which the sun became visible for the first time, after 40 days obscured by clouds.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}
{{Quote|text=And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.|source={{Bibleverse|Genesis|8:5–6|KJV}}}}

==Composition==
[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - The Morning after the Deluge - WGA23180.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) – The Morning after the Deluge – Moses Writing the Book of Genesis|Light and Colour]]'' by [[J. M. W. Turner]], 1843|alt=hazy circle containing multiple human figures]]
Watts illustrated the scene with a highly stylised [[seascape]]. Above the sea is a bright [[sunburst]], with the light of the sun illuminating the surrounding clouds and bright rays projecting beyond the edges of the canvas.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}
Watts's composition echoes [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s 1843 treatment of the same topic, ''[[Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) – The Morning after the Deluge – Moses Writing the Book of Genesis|Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory)—The Morning after the Deluge—Moses Writing the Book of Genesis]]'', in primarily depicting a circle of bright light. However, Turner's painting depicts recognisable human figures, and no work by Turner ever came as close to pure [[abstract art]] as Watts's composition.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}}

In this stage of his career Watts regularly painted images linking awe-inspiring natural events and the will of God.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}} His focus on the sun reflects his longstanding interest in it as a divine symbol; ''The Sacrifice of Noah'', painted {{circa}} 1865, showed Noah sacrificing to the sun in thanks for his family's salvation.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}} This interest in the sun possibly came from Watts's acquaintance [[Max Müller]], who had written extensively on [[solar theory|solar theories of mythology]] (the belief that the religions of Europe, the Middle East and southern Asia were all ultimately derived from [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] worship of the sun).{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}} Writing after Watts's death, his widow [[Mary Seton Watts]] wrote that:
{{quote|text=A visitor looking at ''After the Deluge'' remarked that into such a scheme of colour he felt it would not have been impossible to introduce the figure of the Creator. 'Ah no,' Mr Watts replied. 'But that is exactly what I could wish to make those who look at the picture conceive for themselves. The hand of the Creator moving by light and by heat to re-create. I have not tried to paint a portrait of the sun—such a thing is unpaintable—but I wanted to impress you with the idea of its enormous power.'|source=Mary Seton Watts, writing {{circa}} 1910.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}}}

[[File:Watts – The Genius of Greek Poetry.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''The Genius of Greek Poetry'' by George Frederic Watts, 1878|alt=naked man sitting on a rock, in front of some more naked people and lots of water]]
Watts had previously depicted an orange sun above a flat sea in his 1878 work ''The Genius of Greek Poetry'',{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=198}}{{efn-ua|Watts began work on ''The Genius of Greek Poetry'' in 1856 following a visit to [[Halicarnassus]], but did not complete it until 1878.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=196}}}} but the theme and composition of ''After the Deluge'' was radically different.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}} ''The Genius of Greek Poetry'' was intended to evoke [[pantheism]], with figures representing the forces of nature in human form working and playing, while being watched by the large central figure of the Genius.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=198}} ''After the Deluge'' was explicitly intended as a [[monotheistic]] image, evoking both the magnificence and the redemptive mercy of a single all-powerful God engaging in the act of creation.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}} 

''After the Deluge'' was exhibited in unfinished form in 1886 as ''The Sun'' at [[St Jude's Church, Whitechapel]];{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}}{{efn-ua|Samuel and Henrietta Barnett considered themselves 'missionaries of civilisation',{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=24}} and the exhibitions they organised in Whitechapel were specifically aimed at the uneducated.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=23}} Watts often gave his works simplified titles when exhibiting them at these exhibitions.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}}} [[Samuel Barnett (reformer)|Samuel Barnett]], vicar of St Jude's, organised annual art exhibitions in east London in an effort to bring beauty into the lives of the poor;{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=23}} he had a close relationship with Watts, and regularly borrowed his works to display them to local residents.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=23}}{{efn-ua|Barnett decorated the front of St Jude's with a large mosaic of Watts's ''Time, Death and Judgement.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|pp=23–24}}}} Following this exhibition Watts continued to work on the painting for a further five years.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}

==After completion==

The completed version of ''After the Deluge'' was exhibited at the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]] in 1891.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}} On the occasion of its 1891 exhibition and at a later exhibition in 1897, also at the New Gallery, it was accompanied by an explanatory note (thought to have been written by Watts) explaining the image:{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}
{{quote|text=A transcendent power of light and heat bursts forth to re-create; darkness is chased away; the waters, obedient to the higher law, already disperse into vapoury mists and pass from the face of the earth.|source=Note accompanying ''After the Deluge'' on its exhibitions at the New Galleries.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}{{efn-ua|The author of the explanatory text is not recorded, but it is believed to have been written by Watts.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}}}}}

Between 1902 and 1906 it was exhibited around the country, being shown in Cork, Edinburgh, Manchester and Dublin, as well as at Watts's own gallery at Little Holland House.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=233}} In 1904 it was transferred to the newly-opened [[Watts Gallery]] in [[Compton, Guildford|Compton]], Surrey, shortly before Watts's death later that year.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=233}} Two years prior to this, Watts had returned to the theme of creation with ''The Sower of the Systems'', which for the first time in one of his works directly depicted God, and which he described as representing "a great gesture into which everything that exists is woven".{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=136}}

Although Watts painted landscapes throughout his life, he did not consider such paintings to be major works, and when between 1886 and 1902 he donated what he felt to be his 23 most significant non-portrait works to the nation for public display, no landscape paintings were included.{{sfn|Bills|2011|p=44}}{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|pp=12–13}}{{efn-ua|From 1883 onwards, Watts donated his significant portrait paintings to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]].{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=42}} In 1886, he donated what he felt at the time were his nine most significant paintings to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum).{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=22}} The latter nine paintings along with nine others were given to the newly formed [[National Gallery of British Art]] (later the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain) on its formation in 1897, with five more works later donated by Watts during his lifetime.{{sfn|Bills|2011|p=44}} The 23 works Watts donated to the Tate Gallery were ''[[The All Pervading]]'', ''Chaos'', ''Clytie'', ''The Court of Death'', ''Death Crowning Innocence'', ''Dray Horses'', ''Dweller in the Basement'', ''Eve Repentant'', ''Eve Tempted'', ''Faith'', ''For He Had Great Possessions'', ''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'', ''Jonah'', ''Love and Death'', ''Love and Life'', ''Love Triumphant'', ''[[Mammon (painting)|Mammon]]'', ''The Messenger'', ''The Minotaur'', ''She Shall Be Called Woman'', ''Sic Transit'', ''Spirit of Christianity'' and ''Time, Death and Judgement''.{{sfn|Bills|2011|p=44}}}} As a consequence of its omission from these gifts to the nation, ''After the Deluge'' is not among his better-known works, although it was greatly admired by many of Watts's fellow artists.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=13}} [[Walter Bayes]] wrote in 1907 that ''After the Deluge'' was "the sort of landscape that we connect with the name of Mr Watts, a landscape from which all that is coarse and material has been eliminated, and which offers a residuum that is a kind of sublimation of all the most poetic elements in nature".{{sfn|Bayes|1907|p=xi}} It has been cited as an influence on many works painted in the two decades following its completion, including paintings of the sun by [[Maurice Chabas]], [[Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo]] and [[Edvard Munch]].{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=13}}  ''After the Deluge'' remains in the collection of the Watts Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/after-the-deluge-13387|title=After the Deluge|publisher=Art UK|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4800">The '''Alexandra Theatre''' was a theatre located in the [[Stoke Newington]] district of [[London]]. Built in 1897, it was located at 65 and 67 Stoke Newington Road where the present-day Alexandra Court now stands. The theatre was demolished in the 1960s.

==History==
Opened on December 27, 1897 as ''The Alexandra Theatre and Opera House'', it was designed by theatre architect [[Frank Matcham]] for F. W. Purcell. Upon opening, the theatre had a capacity of 2,025, spread across pit, traditional circle and gallery seating. In 1904, city records list the theatre’s capacity as 1,710, along with an assessed value of £1,250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harper|first1=Edgar|title=Theatres and music halls : Return of all premises in the Administrative County of London licensed for public entertainments...|date=1904|publisher=J. Truscott and Son, Ltd.|location=London|pages=1|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiuc.2690587_001;view=1up;seq=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The theatre's first performance was the December 27, 1897 staging of ''Dick Whittington'', an adaption of the pantomime [[Dick Whittington and His Cat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Alexandra Theatre and Opera House, 65 &amp; 67 Stoke Newington Road, Stoke Newington"|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/AlexandraTheatreStokeNewington.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was operated by F. W. Purcell until 1905 when he sold it to new owners. The theatre’s new owners changed its name to the Palace Theatre of Varieties. However, in 1909, it was sold again, this time to [[Moss Empires|Stoll Moss Empires, Ltd.]], who reverted it back to its original name, the Alexandra Theatre and placed it under the management of [[Oswald Stoll]]. In the late 1910s Stoll had screens, projectors and other equipment needed for cinema projection installed and by 1922 cine-variety programs were being presented to audiences. The theatre also presented film matinees and on Sundays, on which, by law, no live performances could be done, the theatre screened films exclusively.

In 1932, the Alexandra was purchased by Standard Cinema Properties Ltd. and converted to screen films exclusively. However, in 1934 the theatre came under independent management and, in addition to reverting to featuring a mixture of live and film performances, a modern (for the time) sound system was installed. A few years later, the theatre closed with the entry of the [[United Kingdom]] into [[World War II]]. 

The Alexandra reopened in 1945 after the war ended and subsisted on a variety of live performances, such as boxing matches, [[Yiddish theatre]] productions, and special events. During this period, the theatre hosted performances from the [[Motley Theatre Design Group]], including a 1947 staging of an adaptation of [[Hans Christian Andersen |Hans Christian Andersen's]] ''[[The Snow Queen]]'', adapted by [[Evgeny Schwartz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King|url=https://digital.library.illinois.edu/items/647c7030-73cd-0134-1deb-0050569601ca-8|website=Motley Collection of Theatre and Costume Design}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alexandra remained open and staging productions and events until finally closing its doors for good in 1950. Thereafter, the building stood empty for many years before being demolished in the early 1960s so that the Alexandra Court tenement could be built.

'''Anna''' is a fictional character that appears in the [[Once Upon a Time (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', with actress [[Elizabeth Lail]] portraying the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |title=Once Upon a Time Casts Two Frozen Characters for Season 4 |url=http://tvline.com/2014/07/01/once-upon-a-time-scott-michael-foster-kristoff-elizabeth-lail-anna-cast-season-4/ |publisher=TV Line |accessdate=July 1, 2014 |date=July 1, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702184340/http://tvline.com/2014/07/01/once-upon-a-time-scott-michael-foster-kristoff-elizabeth-lail-anna-cast-season-4/ |archivedate=July 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna is loosely based on the character with the [[Anna (Disney)|same name]] from the 2013 animated film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]].

==Appearance==
Following the events of the film ''Frozen'', Anna is preparing to wed [[Kristoff (Disney)|Kristoff]] when Elsa finds a diary from their mother stating their real reason for their parents' fatal trip. Determined to seek answers, Anna postpones her wedding and travels to the Enchanted Forest (known as Misthaven in Arendelle). Anna meets [[David Nolan (Once Upon a Time)|David]], a friend of Kristoff's, and trains him in [[swordsmanship]] so he can defend his farm from the evil warlord [[Little Bo Peep|Bo Peep]]. Following Bo Peep's defeat, David gives Anna his horse and David's mother gives Anna the name of [[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin]], a powerful wizard who she believes can give her the answers she is looking for. Anna visits Rumplestiltskin ([[Robert Carlyle]]) who tells her that the King and Queen of Arendelle came to him, and he will tell her what they said if she administers a potion to an old man. Anna is afraid the potion is poison and pours it into the old man's fire. She returns to Rumplestiltskin's lair and lies, saying she has given the man the potion, and quickly learns it was an antidote, not a poison. In not giving him the drink, Anna has broken her deal with Rumplestiltskin and subjected the man to turn into a mouse. The deal, when broken, meant that Anna had to be Rumplestiltskin's slave—but, alas, Anna gets control of the dagger that controls him, and orders him to never harm her or her sister, and to send her back home with Rumplestiltskin's weapon, a magic-stealing hat. Back in Arendelle, Anna admits to Kristoff that Rumplestiltskin told her that her parents were afraid of Elsa. She does not tell this to Elsa, but is shocked to see that Elsa is learning to control her power—due to a new woman by the name of Ingrid ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]), who claims she is their mother's sister and also has magic snow powers like her sister Elsa. Anna never knew their mother had a sister, so she is immediately skeptical. She goes to meet Grand Pabbie and the rock trolls to find out if this is the truth. While purchasing supplies at Oaken's shop, Anna runs into [[Belle (Once Upon a Time)|Belle]] ([[Emilie de Ravin]]) and they become friends. Together, they journey to the rock trolls, where Anna learns that her mother had two sisters named Ingrid and Helga, but Grand Pabbie changed everyone's memory in all of Arendelle. On the return journey back to the castle, Anna and Belle run into Ingrid. Ingrid sees that Anna has Rumplestiltskin's magic-stealing hat and believes she will betray her, so she grabs hold of Anna and imprisons her. Ingrid tells Anna that she has nothing in common with either her or Elsa as she has no magic as they, and now Ingrid must replace her. Eventually, Anna reunites with her sister, helps Ingrid see the errors of her ways, and marries Kristoff.

==Reception==
With the introduction of ''Frozen'' characters, the season 4 of ''Once Upon a Time'' saw a 31-percent increase in ratings from the autumn of 2013 (9.3 million viewers), marking its best ratings in almost two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hibberd |first1=James |title='Family Guy,' 'Once Upon' get big return ratings |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/09/29/family-guy-once-upon-ratings/ |accessdate=January 16, 2015 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=September 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206153138/http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/09/29/family-guy-once-upon-ratings/ |archivedate=December 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avaldsnes Church''' ({{lang-no|Avaldsnes kirke}}, formally ''St. Olav's Church at Avaldsnes'', {{lang-no|St Olavskirken på Avaldsnes}}) is a [[parish church]] in [[Karmøy]] municipality in [[Rogaland]] county, [[Norway]].  The [[medieval]] stone church is located in the village of [[Avaldsnes]] on the northern part of the island of [[Karmøy (island)|Karmøy]].  The first church located here was likely built before the year 1024 on the site of a royal estate.  The present stone church was built in 1250 and it seats about 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haugalandet.net/ht000108.htm|title=Avaldsnes kirke|publisher=Haugesund Today|accessdate=2015-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151110072739/http://www.haugalandet.net/ht000108.htm|archive-date=2015-11-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The church is part of the Avaldsnes [[parish]] in the [[List of churches in Rogaland#Karmøy prosti|Karmøy]] [[deanery]] in the [[Diocese of Stavanger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkesok.no/eng/kirker/Avaldsnes-kirke|title=Avaldsnes kirke|publisher=Kirkesøk: Kirkebyggdatabasen|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkekonsulenten.no/kirker.htm|title=Oversikt over Nåværende Kirker|language=Norwegian|publisher=KirkeKonsulenten.no |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Dahl.I.C.1820.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Avaldsnes Kirke''&lt;br&gt; [[Johan Christian Dahl]] (1820)]]
Before this church was constructed, there was a wooden church on the same site around the year 1024. That church is assumed to have been built by [[Olav Trygvason]], and it is possible that the present stone church is built around this church originally.

This church has been a landmark for seafarers passing through the [[Karmsundet]] strait for 750 years. King [[Haakon IV of Norway|Håkon IV Håkonsson]] gave permission to build a church around the year 1250. It was  not completed until nearly 1320, and was then the fourth largest in the country. The church was dedicated to [[Olaf II of Norway|St. Olav]] and received the status of "Royal Chapel". During the same period it became one of four "college-churches" (it appointed a council of theological and juridical scholars). Probably there was a group of four scholars and teachers in law and theology. There could be there was an octagonal house of stone in close proximity to the [[Quire (architecture)|quire]]. Chapter Houses (''Kapittelhus'') were common for [[England|English]] [[cathedral]]s. This is assumed to have been referenced by clergyman and historical writer [[:no:Peder Clausen Friis|Peder Clausen Friis]] in 1599. Remaining walls were visible as late as 1840, but are now completely gone.

The history of the church depicts a fine cross-section of Norway's history. Being one of the largest churches along the coast of Norway, it is certain to have been visited by many travelers on their [[pilgrimage]] to St. Olav's [[shrine]] in [[Trondheim]].

Decay started with the [[Black Death]] in 1349–1351. This disaster was followed by 400 years of [[Denmark|Danish]] supremacy. In this period, the church gradually fell into a state of ruin due to lack of repair. By the 17th century a little wooden church was built inside the stone walls. This one was used for more than 200 years.

The first restoration work began in 1830. The old steeple was demolished, the [[nave]] was rebuilt, and a small wooden steeple was erected on the top. In the 1920s the church was once again restored in a manner which was more similar to its original architecture. A new stone steeple was built and the interior renewed.

The [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation in [[World War II]] became dramatic for the church. The Germans asserted that the high steeple was used as a landmark for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] planes, coming in over the strait of [[Karmsund]] to drop bombs in the water. German authorities demanded the steeple be demolished. Many people were engaged in the task of saving it, and they persuaded the Germans to let them [[camouflage]] the whole church with [[timber]]. This was to be done in 5 weeks, but the whole job lasted a year. The front of the church bears a couple of bullet holes.

The 700th anniversary of the church in 1950 was a big event for the community, with concerts and a historical outdoor play which pictured the [[Viking]] history of the place.

The stained glass windows were ordered for the anniversary. They were made by Bernhard Greve, a Norwegian painter, and present the most important events in the life of [[Christ]]: Baptism, passion, ascension, and resurrection.

The altar, font, and [[pulpit]] were designed by Eivind Moestue in the 1920s.  The baptismal basin dates back to the 16th century.

==Design and architecture==
The pointed arches, but thick walls and no [[column|pillar]]s, suggest an early [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] design. The walls are composed of ordinary gray stone in thickness about {{convert|1.2|to|2|m}}. The corners and frames around the doors and windows are of [[steatite]] (soapstone) from Tolgetjønn near [[Haugesund]].

Mary's Needle, known in Norwegian as ''the sewing needle of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]'' ({{lang-no|Jomfru Marias synål}}) is the only one remaining of several monumental stones which once stood around the church area. The stone has been somewhat taller, but, towering at {{convert|7.2|m}} it is still the next largest of its kind in Norway. The stone leans in towards the church wall&amp;mdash;the distance to the wall is in fact only {{convert|9.2|cm}}.

A [[saga]] tells that ''"the day of Judgement will come when the stone comes into contact with the church wall"''. A popular story tells us about the minister in ages past climbing up the monument and cutting off a piece from the stone when it came dangerously near the church wall!

'''Celtic coinage''' was minted by the [[Celts]] from the  late 4th century BC to the late 1st century BC. Celtic coins were influenced by trade with and the supply of mercenaries to the Greeks, and initially copied Greek designs, especially [[Greek_drachma#Ancient_drachma|Macedonian coins]] from the time of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and his son, [[Alexander the Great]].
&lt;ref name="Boardman, p.308"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA461 ''Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia" John T.

Greek coinage occurred in three Greek cities of [[Marseille|Massalia]], [[Emporiae]] and [[Roses, Girona|Rhoda]], and was copied throughout southern Gaul.&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;

Northern Gaulish coins were especially influenced by the coinage of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and his famous son [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt; Celtic coins often retained Greek subjects, such as the head of [[Apollo]] on the obverse and two-horse [[chariot]] on the reverse of the gold [[stater]] of Philip II, but developed their own style from that basis, allowing for the development of a Graeco-Celtic synthesis.&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;

After this first period in which Celtic coins rather faithfully reproduced Greek types, designs started to become more symbolic, as exemplified by the coinage of the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] in the Belgic region of northern France.&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;

The [[Armorica]]n Celtic style in northwestern Gaul also developed from Celtic designs from the [[Rhine]] valley, themselves derived from earlier Greek prototypes such as the wine scroll and split [[palmette]].&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;

The [[Boii]] gave their name to Bohemia and Bologna; a Celtic coin ([[Biatec]]) from [[Bratislava]]'s mint is displayed on Slovak 5 koruna coin, which was  in use until Slovakia joined the euro zone on January 1, 2009.

The images found on Celtic coins include giants trailing severed heads on rope, horsemen charging into battle, gods and goddesses, skulls and chariot wheels, thunderbolts and lightning, the sun and the moon. They are miniature masterpieces of surreal art.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

A tribe of Celts called [[Eburones]] minted gold coins with triple spirals (a Celtic good luck symbol) on the front, and horses on the back.&lt;ref&gt;'''[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,452724,00.html Cache of Celtic Coins Uncovered in Dutch Cornfield]''' ''[[Associated Press]]'' November 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The coins were either 'struck' or 'cast'. Both methods required a substantial degree of knowledge. Striking a blank coin formed in a clay was one way. After forming the blank, it would have been flattened out before striking with a die made from iron or bronze. The tiny details engraved on dies were just a few millimeters in diameter. Casting a coin required a different technique. They were produced by pouring molten alloy into a set of molds which were broken apart when the metal had cooled.

With the Roman invasion of Gaul, Greek-inspired Celtic coinage started to incorporate Roman influence instead, until it disappeared to be completely replaced by Roman coinage.&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;

'''Cholamandal Artists' Village''', established in 1966, is the largest artists' commune in India. Its artists are credited for the Madras Movement of Art (1950s–1980s), which brought [[modernism]] to art in [[South India]]. Their work is widely recognized as some of the best art produced in postwar India and is shown regularly in galleries across the country. Several Cholamandal artists have also shown in Europe, the United States and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=In India, Pioneers of Modernism Savor Their Success |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/29/arts/arts-abroad-in-india-pioneers-of-modernism-savor-their-success.html?pagewanted=all |date=29 January 1998 |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=[[Stephen Kinzer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the village [[Injambakkam]], 9&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chennai]], [[India]], it has over 20 resident painters and sculptors, who live as a community and pool their skills. They run the Artists Handicrafts Association, a cooperative which manages the village and sale of works through the permanent exhibition at the complex, which includes paintings, sketches, terra-cotta/stone/metal sculptures, batiks and handicrafts etc., making the village a self-supporting entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india9.com/i9show/Cholamandal-Artists%27-Village-25859.htm Cholamandal Artists' Village]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Celebrate the oeuvre|url=http://www.hindu.com/businessline/2000/10/02/stories/100244m2.htm|date=2 October 2000|publisher=[[Business Line]]|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The community was founded by [[K. C. S. Paniker]], the principal of the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Arts]], along with his students and a few artists associated with the college. It used the `art-meets-craft' approach where artists made handicrafts for a living as they pursued their art. By the 1970s, the village became self-sufficient and grew into one of the most important meeting places for international artists in India. Today, it is one of the few artist-driven movements in India. Four decades on, it is one of the few artists' colonies in the world to survive successfully and its foundation remains one of the "10 biggest art moments" in India.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=10 biggest art moments |url= http://indiatoday.intoday.in/index.php?issueid=116&amp;id=22988&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;sectionid=25|date=19 December 2008  |publisher=[[India Today]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Most of the original founding creative artists, painters and sculptors were students and artists associated with the [[Government School of Arts and Crafts, Chennai]] (Madras School of Arts), where [K.C.S. Paniker], noted metaphysical and abstract painter, was principal 1957 to 1967. These artists desired to form a congenial space for practising their art; 38 of them got together and formed the 'Artists Handicrafts Association' (AHA) in 1963 initially to sell the works of artists.

Gradually, the artists started working together, producing handicrafts in their spare time. They were among the first in the country to produce [[batik]] fabric; proceeds of their first batik exhibition went into buying the {{convert|8.5|acre|m2}} of land in 1966, which was to make up the village.&lt;ref name=art/&gt; By now K.C.S. Paniker had retired and founded the artists commune in April 1966.

It was named after the [[Chola dynasty]], which is known to have encouraged arts and ruled the region, 9-13th century AD — called ''Cholamandalam'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], which literally translated as ''the realm of the [[Chola]]s''. Chola also lends its name to the [[Coromandel Coast]] of [[Bay of Bengal]], which is a short walk from the village.&lt;ref name=ab&gt;[http://www.cholamandalartistsvillage.org/aboutus.html About us]&lt;/ref&gt; Paniker was "worried that his students might deviate from art due to financial compulsions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tantric geometry: Velu Viswanadhan|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story_print.php?storyId=30155 |date=5 May 2007 |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |page=|quote="“Panicker was worried that his students might deviate from art due to financial compulsions. 'Cholamandalam gave them the security,' says Viswanadhan."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year six artists moved into live and work on their own land. In the 60s, while they could hardly sell their paintings, avant garde wood and leather work, batik, ceramics and metal craft, they found a good market. This sustained them, while the local buyers were familiarized to modernism, which their art represented.

Electricity was provided in 1968 and till 1972 the mud road ended at [[Muttukadu boat house|Muttukadu]]. The village was on a lonely, bumpy road, now known as the [[East Coast Road]] highway to [[Mahabalipuram]], from [[Adyar (Tamil Nadu)|Adyar]]. Chennai was further away, though today, it is right at its door steps, and the road is busy with traffic and shops and commercial establishments. Over the years, built their houses, studios, exhibition gallery, theatre, workshop and kitchen, which they jointly owned along with all the infrastructure of the village.

It nurtured artists such as [[J. Sultan Ali]], [[K.M. Gopal|Dr. K.M. Gopal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = K.M | first1 = Gopal | first2 = Selin | last2 = George

Nanda Gopal, S.G. Vasudev, K. Jayapala Panicker, Gopinath, Senathipathy, M.V. Devan and Richard Jesudas. Soon they formed a cooperative to look after the village and built a gallery, which displayed and sold their works; 20% of their sales went to the ‘Cholamandal Artists Handicrafts Association’, which used the funds for village upkeep. In time the cooperative became self-sufficient and held exhibitions of their work in major cities of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=India: Country Guides, Lonely Planet |last= Singh|first=Sarina|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|location= |isbn=1-74104-308-5|page=1044 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7ZHUhSEleYC&amp;pg=PA1044&amp;dq=%22Cholamandal+Artists+Village%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cholamandal%20Artists%20Village%22&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cholamandal collection  |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/life/2009/02/27/stories/2009022750120400.htm |date=27 February 2009 |publisher=[[Business Line]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

K.C.S. Paniker died in 1977. By this time the module had proven sustainable.&lt;ref name=ab/&gt; Over the years, work done by the artists at the village, initiated a period in south Indian art called the 'Madras Movement', which brought modernism to [[south India]]n art. The Progressive Painters’ Association (P.P.A.), one of the oldest art associations in India founded by Paniker in Chennai in 1944; it was inactive for many year after Paniker's death. The association was revived in 2006 and a new committee formed. It is now being carried forward by artists at the village&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=For art’s sake  |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/02/12/stories/2009021251330400.htm |date= 12 February 2009|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Brush with peace- Cholamandal: an Artists Village (OUP), edited by Josef James |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2004/07/18/stories/2004071800020100.htm |date=18 July 2004 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Progressive strokes  |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/03/04/stories/2006030401800500.htm|date=4 March 2006 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an annually elected general council of members administers Cholamandal.

==Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art==
During his last days Paniker had offered his oeuvre to the Madras government on the condition that a separate gallery be created for his work. When no response came from the government, the Trivandrum Art Gallery took up the offer and now houses an important collection of Paniker's work. The artists at the village wanted a place to display the work of the Madras Movement, thus idea of the art museum took place.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt;

The artists raised money from the private sector to fund a museum in the village, which would house a permanent collection of artworks representative of the Madras Movement.&lt;ref name=art&gt;{{Cite web|title=Arts and ideas|url=http://www.hindu.com/businessline/2000/12/04/stories/100444a3.htm|date=4 December 2000 |publisher=[[Business Line]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Master takes |url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main42.asp?filename=hub080809mastertakes.asp |date=8 August 2009 |publisher=[[Tehelka]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the initial design was made by a visiting Dutch couple, the design for the art centre was made by architects [[Sheila Sri Prakash]] of [[Shilpa Architects]] and M. V. Devan. As the project gathered momentum help came in from artists and corporates alike.

After three and half years of construction the building was finished — thus started a long search for works that exemplified the Madras Movement, which flourished between the early 50s and the 80s. Eventually about 60 per cent of the works were donated by senior artists and the rest were given on extended loan by art collectors around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Another first for Indian art |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2008/06/03/stories/2008060350110100.htm |date=3 June 2008 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art opened on 1 February 2009. It has a 'Museum of the Madras Movement', which display works of prominent artists of the movement (apart from that of Paniker) including J. Sultan Ali, [[K.M. Gopal|Dr. K.M. Gopal]] M. Senathipathi, Late [[A.P. Santhanaraj]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20090518010148/http://www.thenoblesage.com/page278.html P.S. Nandhan], [[S.G. Vasudev]], K.V. Haridasan, Thotta Tharani, Sculptor S. Nandagopal. The centre has two commercial galleries, 'Labernum' and 'Indigo', that can be rented free of commission charge, an art book store, and a craft shop.

Cholamandal does not accept new members, though it has at least a dozen artists living or working there at any time, plus many artists-in-residence are at work.&lt;ref name=art/&gt;

The village is open daily from 10am to 5pm. It is 10-minute walking distance from the Golden Beach. Local transport is easily available, and the Chennai International Airport is the nearest airport.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3839">The '''Cripple Creek Theatre Company''' is a grassroots, non-profit theatre company in [[New Orleans, LA]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States]] known for producing productions with large, diverse casts.  The company was founded in December 2005 by [[Andrew Kingsley]] and [[Andrew Vaught]] for the purpose of instigating action toward social and economic justice in the South. The founders both attended [[Kenyon College]] in [[Gambier, Ohio]] where they studied American history and theater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.kenyoncollegian.com/media/storage/paper821/news/2006/11/09/Features/Players.For.Social.Change-2450265.shtml "Players for social change" by Kate Farrow, November 9, 2006, from ''Kenyon Collegian'']{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre has been identified a driving force in the recovering city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/01/arts/NA-FEA-US-Katrina-Theater.php?page=1 "New Orleans theater's post-Katrina boom," International Herald Tribune, August 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productions ==

In March 2007, the theatre produced ''The Green, Gold and Purple Shuffle'' a satire of Louisiana politics featuring former governor [[Edwin Edwards]] and klansman [[David Duke]]. The production, performed in Washington Park in the [[Faubourg Marigny|Marigny]], employed the device of [[invisible theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105230519/http://www.cripplecreekplayers.org/documents/reviews/tp-shuffle.pdf "Satirical Shuffle Amuzes in Park" by David Cuthbert, March 17, 2007, from ''The Times-Picayune'']&lt;/ref&gt; The [[City of New Orleans]] refused access to the Moon Walk adjacent [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]] because of the controversial subject matter.

''Bury the Dead'', an anti-war zombie play. The production was nominated for three [[Ambie Awards]], including best drama. Andrew Vaught was nominated for best direction and Andrew Kingsley for best lighting design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stageclick.com/show/75.aspx "Ambie Awards for 2007"&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's production of the Inspector General by [[Nikolai Gogol]] and adapted by Andrew Kingsley was taped by CNN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestofneworleans.com/dispatch/2008-03-04/thea_rec.php "Stage Recommended: The Inspector General" by Will Coviello, March 4, 2008, from ''Gambit Weekly'']{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The play coincided with the establishment of the [[City of New Orleans]]' Office of the Inspector General. [[Robert A. Cerasoli]] addressed the audience following many performances.

The theatre was asked to restage its inaugural production, Tennessee Williams' 'Kingdom of Earth' at the Tennessee Williams Festival in the spring of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120907151624/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/123862.html "Sternhagen, Caldwell, Seldes, Among Guests at 2009 Tennessee Williams Fest" by Kenneth Jones, December 2, 2008, from ''Playbill Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

The company also runs the [[Louisiana Stage Writers' Workshop]] which encourages playwright development in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cripplecreekplayers.org/pages/initiatives.html Cripple Creek Theatre Co.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080820025825/http://www.cripplecreekplayers.org/pages/initiatives.html |date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cubism''' is an early-20th-century [[art movement]] which brought European [[painting]] and [[sculpture]] historically forward toward 20th century [[Modern art]]. Cubism in its various forms inspired related movements in [[literature]] and [[architecture]]. Cubism has been considered to be among the most influential art movements of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, MoMA collection, ''Cubism, Introduction'', from Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813112047/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1 |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2014/cubism-the-leonard-lauder-collection ''Cubism: The Leonard A. Lauder Collection'', The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517015704/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2014/cubism-the-leonard-lauder-collection |date=2015-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is broadly used in association with a wide variety of art produced in Paris ([[Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse]] and [[Puteaux]]) during the 1910s and throughout the 1920s.

The movement was pioneered by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], joined by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], and [[Fernand Léger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541#skipToContent Christopher Green, MoMA collection ''Cubism, Origins and application of the term'', from Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613022945/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541 |date=2014-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] form in the late works of [[Paul Cézanne]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813112047/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1 |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.&lt;ref name="Joann Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press 1985, pp. 34-42&lt;/ref&gt; In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture'', Pan (Paris), October–November 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of Cubism was far-reaching and wide-ranging. In other countries [[Futurism]], [[Suprematism]], [[Dada]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[De Stijl]] and [[Art Deco]] developed in response to Cubism. Early Futurist paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time, also called multiple perspective, [[simultaneity]] or multiplicity,&lt;ref name="MoMA, Meanings and interpretations"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702090838/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544 |date=2015-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Constructivism was influenced by Picasso's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10955&amp;section_id=T019195#skipToContent Christina Lodder, 2009, ''Constructivism, Formation, 1914–21'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024234226/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10955&amp;section_id=T019195 |date=2008-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern life.

==History==
Historians have divided the history of Cubism into phases. In one scheme, the first phase of Cubism, known as ''Analytic Cubism'', a phrase coined by Juan Gris a posteriori,&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 784. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1910 and 1912 in France. A second phase, ''Synthetic Cubism'', remained vital until around 1919, when the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movement gained popularity. English [[art historian]] [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]] proposed another scheme, describing three phases of Cubism in his book, ''The Cubist Epoch''. According to Cooper there was "Early Cubism", (from 1906 to 1908) when the movement was initially developed in the studios of Picasso and Braque; the second phase being called "High Cubism", (from 1909 to 1914) during which time [[Juan Gris]] emerged as an important exponent (after 1911); and finally Cooper referred to "Late Cubism" (from 1914 to 1921) as the last phase of Cubism as a radical [[avant-garde]] movement.&lt;ref name="The Cubist Epoch"&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up "The Cubist Epoch"], pp. 11–221, 232, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Cooper's restrictive use of these terms to distinguish the work of Braque, Picasso, Gris (from 1911) and Léger (to a lesser extent) implied an intentional value judgement.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

===Proto-Cubism: 1907-1908===
{{main|Proto-Cubism}}
Cubism burgeoned between 1907 and 1911. Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' has often been considered a [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] work. Georges Braque's 1908 ''[[Houses at L’Estaque]]'' (and related works) prompted the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]], in ''Gil Blas'', 25 March 1909, to refer to ''bizarreries cubiques'' (cubic oddities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7536065n Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'', Gil Blas, 25 March 1909], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gertrude Stein]] referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as ''Reservoir at Horta de Ebro'', as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] in [[Paris]] during the spring of 1911 in a room called 'Salle 41'; it included works by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], yet no works by Picasso or Braque were exhibited.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

By 1911 Picasso was recognized as the inventor of Cubism, while Braque’s importance and precedence was argued later, with respect to his treatment of space, volume and mass in the L’Estaque landscapes. But "this view of Cubism is associated with a distinctly restrictive definition of which artists are properly to be called Cubists," wrote the art historian Christopher Green: "Marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 1911 [...]"&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The assertion that the Cubist depiction of space, mass, time, and volume supports (rather than contradicts) the flatness of the canvas was made by [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] as early as 1920,&lt;ref&gt;D.-H. Kahnweiler. Der Weg zum Kubismus (Munich, 1920; Eng. trans., New York, 1949)&lt;/ref&gt; but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s, especially by [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Greenberg. ‘The Pasted-paper Revolution’, ARTnews, 57 (1958), pp. 46–9, 60–61; repr. as ‘Collage’ in Art and Culture (Boston, 1961), pp. 70–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary views of Cubism are complex, formed to some extent in response to the "Salle 41" Cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of Picasso and Braque to be considered merely secondary to them. Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore developed. Wider views of Cubism include artists who were later associated with the "Salle 41" artists, e.g., [[Francis Picabia]]; the brothers [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the [[Section d'Or]] (or the [[Puteaux Group]]); the sculptors [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]] as well as [[Jacques Lipchitz]] and [[Henri Laurens]]; and painters such as [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[František Kupka]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Léopold Survage]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[André Lhote]], [[Gino Severini]] (after 1916), [[María Blanchard]] (after 1916) and [[Georges Valmier]] (after 1918). More fundamentally, Christopher Green argues that Douglas Cooper's terms were "later undermined by interpretations of the work of Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger that stress iconographic and ideological questions rather than methods of representation."&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

[[John Berger]] identifies the essence of Cubism with the mechanical diagram. "The metaphorical model of Cubism is the diagram: The diagram being a visible symbolic representation of invisible processes, forces, structures. A diagram need not eschew certain aspects of appearance but these too will be treated as signs not as imitations or recreations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=John|title=The Moment of Cubism|year=1969|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780297177098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High Cubism: 1909-1914 ===
[[File:Albert Gleizes, l'Homme au Balcon, 1912, oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Albert Gleizes]], ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|L'Homme au Balcon, Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)]]'', 1912, oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm (77 x 45 1/4 in.), [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. Completed the same year that Albert Gleizes co-authored the book ''Du "Cubisme"'' with Jean Metzinger. Exhibited at Salon d'Automne, Paris, 1912, [[Armory show]], New York, Chicago, Boston, 1913]]
There was a distinct difference between Kahnweiler’s Cubists and the Salon Cubists. Prior to 1914, Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger (to a lesser extent) gained the support of a single committed art dealer in Paris, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who guaranteed them an annual income for the exclusive right to buy their works. Kahnweiler sold only to a small circle of connoisseurs. His support gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative privacy. Picasso worked in Montmartre until 1912, while Braque and Gris remained there until after the First World War. Léger was based in Montparnasse.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

In contrast, the Salon Cubists built their reputation primarily by exhibiting regularly at the Salon d'Automne and the Salon des Indépendants, both major non-academic Salons in Paris. They were inevitably more aware of public response and the need to communicate.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; Already in 1910 a group began to form which included Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay and Léger. They met regularly at Henri le Fauconnier's studio near the Boulevard de Montparnasse. These soirées often included writers such as Guillaume Apollinaire and [[André Salmon]]. Together with other young artists, the group wanted to emphasise a research into form, in opposition to the Neo-Impressionist emphasis on color.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie"&gt;[http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie (in French)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112092816/http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf |date=November 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1910 Salon d'Automne, a few months later, Metzinger exhibited his highly fractured ''[[Nu à la cheminée|Nu à la cheminée (Nude)]]'', which was subsequently reproduced in both ''Du "Cubisme"'' (1912) and ''Les Peintres Cubistes'' (1913).&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

The first public controversy generated by Cubism resulted from Salon showings at the Indépendants during the spring of 1911. This showing by Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, le Fauconnier and Léger brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the first time. Amongst the Cubist works presented, Robert Delaunay exhibited his ''Eiffel Tower, Tour Eiffel'' (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1022 Robert Delaunay, Eiffel Tower (Tour Eiffel), 1911 (dated 1910 by the artist).

At the Salon d'Automne of the same year, in addition to the Indépendants group of ''Salle 41'', were exhibited works by [[André Lhote]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], Jacques Villon, [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]] and [[František Kupka]]. The exhibition was reviewed in the October 8, 1911 issue of ''The New York Times''.

:"Among all the paintings on exhibition at the Paris Fall Salon none is attracting so much attention as the extraordinary productions of the so-called "Cubist" school. In fact, dispatches from Paris suggest that these works are easily the main feature of the exhibition. [...]

:In spite of the crazy nature of the "Cubist" theories the number of those professing them is fairly respectable. Georges Braque, André Derain, Picasso, Czobel, Othon Friesz, Herbin, Metzinger—these are a few of the names signed to canvases before which Paris has stood and now again stands in blank amazement.

The subsequent 1912 Salon des Indépendants was marked by the presentation of Marcel Duchamp's ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'', which itself caused a scandal, even amongst the Cubists. It was in fact rejected by the hanging committee, which included his brothers and other Cubists. Although the work was shown in the Salon de la Section d'Or in October 1912 and the 1913 Armory Show in New York, Duchamp never forgave his brothers and former colleagues for censoring his work.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51449.html?mulR=24120|3 Philadelphia Museum of Art, Marcel Duchamp, Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918063503/http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51449.html?mulR=24120%7C3 |date=2017-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Gris, a new addition to the Salon scene, exhibited his ''Portrait of Picasso'' (Art Institute of Chicago), while Metzinger's two showings included ''[[La Femme au Cheval|La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse)]]'' 1911-1912 ([[National Gallery of Denmark]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/the-royal-collections/french-art-1900-1930/highlights/jean-metzinger-woman-with-a-horse/ Statens Museum for Kunst, National Gallery of Denmark, Jean Metzinger, ''Woman with a Horse'', 1911–1912, oil on canvas, 162 x 130 cm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115151153/http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/the-royal-collections/french-art-1900-1930/highlights/jean-metzinger-woman-with-a-horse/ |date=January 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaunay's monumental ''La Ville de Paris'' (Musée d'art moderne de la Ville de Paris) and Léger's ''La Noce, The Wedding'' (Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris) were also exhibited.

The Cubist contribution to the [[Salon d'Automne#1912.2C political ramifications|1912 Salon d'Automne]] created scandal regarding the use of government owned buildings, such as the [[Grand Palais]], to exhibit such artwork. The indignation of the politician [[Jean Pierre Philippe Lampué]] made the front page of ''Le Journal'', 5 October 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7625001c/f1.image ''M.

Barrer: ''Quand l'art du XXe siècle était conçu par les inconnus'', pp. 93-101, gives an account of the debate.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953''] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6E8g1DoyE?url=http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/chronology |date=2013-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was against this background of public anger that Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes wrote ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' (published by Eugène Figuière in 1912, translated to English and Russian in 1913).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070918235710/http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/albert-gleizes-oeuvre.html Fondation Gleizes, Son Oeuvre]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works exhibited were [[Henri Le Fauconnier|Le Fauconnier]]'s vast composition ''Les Montagnards attaqués par des ours (Mountaineers Attacked by Bears)'' now at Rhode Island School of Design Museum, [[Joseph Csaky]]'s ''Deux Femme, Two Women'' (a sculpture now lost), in addition to the highly abstract paintings by Kupka, ''Amorpha'' (The National Gallery, Prague), and [[Picabia]], ''La Source, The Spring'' (Museum of Modern Art, New York).

====Abstraction and the ready-made====
[[File:Robert Delaunay, 1912, Les Fenêtres simultanée sur la ville (Simultaneous Windows on the City), 40 x 46 cm, Kunsthalle Hamburg.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Delaunay]], ''Simultaneous Windows on the City'', 1912, 46 x 40 cm, [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]], an example of ''Abstract Cubism'']]
The most extreme forms of Cubism were not those practiced by Picasso and Braque, who resisted total abstraction. Other Cubists, by contrast, especially [[František Kupka]], and those considered [[Orphism (art)|Orphists]] by [[Apollinaire]] (Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and Duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. Kupka’s two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, ''Amorpha-Fugue à deux couleurs'' and ''Amorpha chromatique chaude'', were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled ''Simultaneous Windows'', followed by a series entitled ''Formes Circulaires'', in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In 1913–14 Léger produced a series entitled ''Contrasts of Forms'', giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in ''Les Peintres cubistes'' (1913),&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt; writing of a new "pure" painting in which the subject was vacated. But in spite of his use of the term Orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

Also labeled an Orphist by Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp was responsible for another extreme development inspired by Cubism. The [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|ready-made]] arose from a joint consideration that the work itself is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage). The next logical step, for Duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself. In 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

====Section d'Or====
{{main|Section d'Or}}

The ''Section d'Or'', also known as ''Groupe de Puteaux'', founded by some of the most conspicuous Cubists, was a collective of painters, sculptors and critics associated with Cubism and Orphism, active from 1911 through about 1914, coming to prominence in the wake of their controversial showing at the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]]. The ''Salon de la Section d'Or'' at the ''Galerie La Boétie'' in Paris, October 1912, was arguably the most important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition; exposing Cubism to a wide audience. Over 200 works were displayed, and the fact that many of the artists showed artworks representative of their development from 1909 to 1912 gave the exhibition the allure of a Cubist retrospective.&lt;ref name="The History and Chronology of Cubism"&gt;[http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm The History and Chronology of Cubism, p. 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314010756/http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm |date=2013-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group seems to have adopted the name Section d'Or to distinguish themselves from the narrower definition of Cubism developed in parallel by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] in the [[Montmartre]] quarter of Paris, and to show that Cubism, rather than being an isolated art-form, represented the continuation of a grand tradition (indeed, the [[golden ratio]] had fascinated Western intellectuals of diverse interests for at least 2,400 years).&lt;ref&gt;[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+numéro+spécial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg La Section d'Or, Numéro spécial, 9 Octobre 1912] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403151309/http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+num%C3%A9ro+sp%C3%A9cial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg |date=2017-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the Section d'Or originated in the course of conversations between Metzinger, Gleizes and Jacques Villon. The group's title was suggested by Villon, after reading a 1910 translation of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Codex Urbinas|Trattato della Pittura]]'' by [[Joséphin Péladan]].

The fact that the 1912 exhibition had been curated to show the successive stages through which Cubism had developed, and that ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' had been published for the occasion, indicates the artists' intention of making their work comprehensible to a wide audience (art critics, art collectors, art dealers and the general public). Undoubtedly, due to the great success of the exhibition, Cubism became recognized as a tendency, genre or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal.&lt;ref name="The History and Chronology of Cubism" /&gt;

===Late Cubism: 1914-1921===
{{main|Crystal Cubism}}

====Crystal Cubism: 1914-1918====

A significant modification of Cubism between 1914 and 1916 was signaled by a shift towards a strong emphasis on large overlapping geometric planes and flat surface activity. This grouping of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920, was practiced by several artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector [[Léonce Rosenberg]]. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the critic [[Maurice Raynal]] as 'crystal' Cubism. Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of [[World War I]]—such as the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]], dynamism of modern life, the occult, and [[Henri Bergson]]'s concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7ZuQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Christopher+Green,+%27%27Cubism+and+Its+Enemies:+Modern+Movements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gliFVJKzJcizUe3AghA&amp;redir_esc=y Christopher Green, ''Cubism and Its Enemies: Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101225927/https://books.google.com/books?id=e7ZuQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Christopher+Green,+%27%27Cubism+and+Its+Enemies:+Modern+Movements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gliFVJKzJcizUe3AghA&amp;redir_esc=y |date=2016-01-01 }}'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, {{ISBN|0300034687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal Cubism, and its associative ''rappel à l’ordre'', has been linked with an inclination—by those who served the armed forces and by those who remained in the civilian sector—to escape the realities of the Great War, both during and directly following the conflict. The purifying of Cubism from 1914 through the mid-1920s, with its cohesive unity and voluntary constraints, has been linked to a much broader [[Ideology|ideological]] transformation towards [[conservatism]] in both French society and [[Culture of France|French culture]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

====Cubism after 1918====
[[File:Picasso three musicians moma 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''[[Three Musicians]]'' (1921), [[Museum of Modern Art]]. ''Three Musicians'' is a classic example of Synthetic cubism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78630 |title=The Museum of Modern Art |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most innovative period of Cubism was before 1914. After World War I, with the support given by the dealer [[Léonce Rosenberg]], Cubism returned as a central issue for artists, and continued as such until the mid-1920s when its avant-garde status was rendered questionable by the emergence of [[geometric abstraction]] and [[Surrealism]] in [[Paris]]. Many Cubists, including Picasso, Braque, Gris, Léger, Gleizes, and Metzinger, while developing other styles, returned periodically to Cubism, even well after 1925. Cubism reemerged during the 1920s and the 1930s in the work of the American [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and the Englishman [[Ben Nicholson]]. In France, however, Cubism experienced a decline beginning in about 1925. Léonce Rosenberg exhibited not only the artists stranded by Kahnweiler’s exile but others including Laurens, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Gleizes, Csaky, Herbin and Severini. In 1918 Rosenberg presented a series of Cubist exhibitions at his Galerie de l’Effort Moderne in Paris. Attempts were made by Louis Vauxcelles to claim that Cubism was dead, but these exhibitions, along with a well-organized Cubist show at the 1920 Salon des Indépendants and a revival of the Salon de la Section d’Or in the same year, demonstrated it was still alive.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The reemergence of Cubism coincided with the appearance from about 1917–24 of a coherent body of theoretical writing by Pierre Reverdy, Maurice Raynal and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and, among the artists, by Gris, Léger and Gleizes. The occasional return to classicism—figurative work either exclusively or alongside Cubist work—experienced by many artists during this period (called [[Neoclassicism]]) has been linked to the tendency to evade the realities of the war and also to the cultural dominance of a classical or Latin image of France during and immediately following the war. Cubism after 1918 can be seen as part of a wide ideological shift towards [[conservatism]] in both [[French culture|French]] society and culture. Yet, Cubism itself remained evolutionary both within the oeuvre of individual artists, such as Gris and Metzinger, and across the work of artists as different from each other as Braque, Léger and Gleizes. Cubism as a publicly debated movement became relatively unified and open to definition. Its theoretical purity made it a gauge against which such diverse tendencies as [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] or [[Realism (arts)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealizing|Naturalism]], [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]] and abstraction could be compared.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

==Interpretation==
===Intentions and criticism===
[[File:Juan Gris - Portrait of Pablo Picasso - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|[[Juan Gris]], ''Portrait of Picasso'', 1912, oil on canvas, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
The Cubism of Picasso, Braque and Gris had more than a technical or formal significance, and the distinct attitudes and intentions of the Salon Cubists produced different kinds of Cubism, rather than a derivative of their work. "It is by no means clear, in any case," wrote Christopher Green, "to what extent these other Cubists depended on Picasso and Braque for their development of such techniques as faceting, 'passage' and multiple perspective; they could well have arrived at such practices with little knowledge of 'true' Cubism in its early stages, guided above all by their own understanding of Cézanne." The works exhibited by these Cubists at the 1911 and 1912 Salons extended beyond the conventional Cézanne-like subjects—the posed model, still-life and landscape—favored by Picasso and Braque to include large-scale modern-life subjects. Aimed at a large public, these works stressed the use of multiple perspective and complex planar faceting for expressive effect while preserving the eloquence of subjects endowed with literary and philosophical connotations.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

In ''Du "Cubisme"'' Metzinger and Gleizes explicitly related the sense of time to multiple perspective, giving symbolic expression to the notion of ‘duration’ proposed by the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuum, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. The Salon Cubists used the faceted treatment of solid and space and effects of multiple viewpoints to convey a physical and psychological sense of the fluidity of consciousness, blurring the distinctions between past, present and future. One of the major theoretical innovations made by the Salon Cubists, independently of Picasso and Braque, was that of ''simultaneity'',&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; drawing to greater or lesser extent on theories of [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]], [[Maurice Princet]], and Henri Bergson. With simultaneity, the concept of separate spatial and temporal dimensions was comprehensively challenged. [[Perspective (graphical)|Linear perspective]] developed during [[the Renaissance]] was vacated. The subject matter was no longer considered from a specific point of view at a moment in time, but built following a selection of successive viewpoints, i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous angles (and in multiple dimensions) with the eye free to roam from one to the other.&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;

This technique of representing simultaneity, multiple viewpoints (or [[relative motion]]) is pushed to a high degree of complexity in Gleizes' monumental ''[[Harvest Threshing|Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)]]'', exhibited at the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or, Le Fauconnier’s ''Abundance'' shown at the Indépendants of 1911, and Delaunay's ''City of Paris'', shown at the Indépendants in 1912. These ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism. Léger’s ''The Wedding'', also shown at the Salon des Indépendants in 1912, gave form to the notion of simultaneity by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame, where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force. The conjunction of such subject matter with simultaneity aligns Salon Cubism with early Futurist paintings by [[Umberto Boccioni]], Gino Severini and [[Carlo Carrà]]; themselves made in response to early Cubism.&lt;ref name="MoMA, Meanings and interpretations" /&gt;

Cubism and [[modern art|modern European art]] was introduced into the United States at the now legendary 1913 [[Armory Show]] in [[New York City]], which then traveled to [[Chicago]] and [[Boston]]. In the Armory show [[Pablo Picasso]] exhibited ''La Femme au pot de moutarde'' (1910), the sculpture ''Head of a Woman (Fernande)'' (1909–10), ''Les Arbres'' (1907) amongst other cubist works. [[Jacques Villon]] exhibited seven important and large drypoints, while his brother [[Marcel Duchamp]] shocked the American public with his painting ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' (1912). [[Francis Picabia]] exhibited his abstractions ''La Danse à la source'' and ''La Procession, Seville'' (both of 1912). [[Albert Gleizes]] exhibited ''[[La Femme aux Phlox (Gleizes)|La Femme aux phlox]]'' (1910) and ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|L'Homme au balcon]]'' (1912), two highly stylized and faceted cubist works. [[Georges Braque]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] and [[Alexander Archipenko]] also contributed examples of their cubist works.

===Stylistic interpretation===
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Europeans were discovering [[African culture|African]], Polynesian, [[Micronesia]]n and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art. Artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]], and Pablo Picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those foreign cultures. Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through [[Gertrude Stein]], at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in [[primitivism]], [[Iberians|Iberian]] sculpture, [[African art]] and [[African tribal masks]]. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of Greek, Iberian and African art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as [[Proto-Cubism|Protocubism]], as notably seen in ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', the [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedent]] of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24" /&gt;

[[File:Paul Cézanne 163.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Quarry Bibémus'', 1898-1900, [[Museum Folkwang]], [[Essen]], [[Germany]]]]
The art historian Douglas Cooper states that [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] "were particularly influential to the formation of Cubism and especially important to the paintings of Picasso during 1906 and 1907".&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper goes on to say: "The ''Demoiselles'' is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture. This is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. The disruptive, [[expressionist]] element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. Nevertheless, the ''Demoiselles'' is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it."&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24"/&gt;

The most serious objection to regarding the ''Demoiselles'' as the origin of Cubism, with its evident influence of primitive art, is that "such deductions are unhistorical", wrote the art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]]. This familiar explanation "fails to give adequate consideration to the complexities of a flourishing art that existed just before and during the period when Picasso's new painting developed."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1905 and 1908, a conscious search for a new style caused rapid changes in art across France, Germany, Holland, Italy, and Russia. The Impressionists had used a double point of view, and both [[Les Nabis]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] (who also admired Cézanne) flattened the picture plane, reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms. [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] structure and subject matter, most notably to be seen in the works of [[Georges Seurat]] (e.g., ''Parade de Cirque'', ''[[Le Chahut]]'' and ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Le Cirque]]''), was another important influence. There were also parallels in the development of literature and social thought.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

In addition to Seurat, the roots of cubism are to be found in the two distinct tendencies of Cézanne's later work: first his breaking of the painted surface into small multifaceted areas of paint, thereby emphasizing the plural viewpoint given by [[binocular vision]], and second his interest in the simplification of natural forms into cylinders, spheres, and cones. However, the cubists explored this concept further than Cézanne. They represented all the surfaces of depicted objects in a single picture plane, as if the objects had all their faces visible at the same time. This new kind of depiction revolutionized the way objects could be visualized in painting and art.

Exhibited at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants, and published in Apollinaire's 1913 ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations]]''. Provenance: Jacques Nayral, [[Niels Bohr]]]]
The historical study of Cubism began in the late 1920s, drawing at first from sources of limited data, namely the opinions of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. It came to rely heavily on [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s book ''Der Weg zum Kubismus'' (published in 1920), which centered on the developments of Picasso, Braque, Léger, and Gris. The terms "analytical" and "synthetic" which subsequently emerged have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s. Both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify. Neither phase was designated as such at the time corresponding works were created. "If Kahnweiler considers Cubism as Picasso and Braque," wrote Daniel Robbins, "our only fault is in subjecting other Cubists' works to the rigors of that limited definition."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The traditional interpretation of "Cubism", formulated ''post facto'' as a means of understanding the works of Braque and Picasso, has affected our appreciation of other twentieth-century artists. It is difficult to apply to painters such as [[Jean Metzinger]], Albert Gleizes, [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], whose fundamental differences from traditional Cubism compelled Kahnweiler to question whether to call them Cubists at all. According to [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "To suggest that merely because these artists developed differently or varied from the traditional pattern they deserved to be relegated to a secondary or satellite role in Cubism is a profound mistake."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The history of the term "Cubism" usually stresses the fact that Matisse referred to "cubes" in connection with a painting by Braque in 1908, and that the term was published twice by the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in a similar context. However, the word "cube" was used in 1906 by another critic, Louis Chassevent, with reference not to Picasso or Braque but rather to Metzinger and Delaunay:

::"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. [[Paul Signac|Signac]] but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...]".&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent, ''Les Artistes Indépendants, 1906'', Quelques Petits Salons. Paris, 1908. Chassevent discussed Delaunay and Metzinger in terms of Signac's influence, referring to Metzinger's "precision in the cut of his cubes..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical use of the word "cube" goes back at least to May 1901 when Jean Béral, reviewing the work of [[Henri-Edmond Cross]] at the Indépendants in ''Art et Littérature'', commented that he "uses a large and square pointillism, giving the impression of mosaic. One even wonders why the artist has not used cubes of solid matter diversely colored: they would make pretty revetments." (Robert Herbert, 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;221)&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The term Cubism did not come into general usage until 1911, mainly with reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, and Léger.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; In 1911, the poet and critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] accepted the term on behalf of a group of artists invited to exhibit at the Brussels Indépendants. The following year, in preparation for the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], Metzinger and Gleizes wrote and published ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]''&lt;ref&gt;A. Gleizes and J. Metzinger. Du "Cubisme", Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (Eng. trans., London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to dispel the confusion raging around the word, and as a major defence of Cubism (which had caused a public scandal following the 1911 Salon des Indépendants and the 1912 Salon d'Automne in Paris).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k201712x/f1.image Fritz-R.

The result, not solely a collaboration between its two authors, reflected discussions by the circle of artists who met in [[Puteaux]] and [[Courbevoie]]. It mirrored the attitudes of the "artists of Passy", which included Picabia and the Duchamp brothers, to whom sections of it were read prior to publication.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; The concept developed in ''Du "Cubisme"'' of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously, i.e., the act of moving around an object to seize it from several successive angles fused into a single image (multiple viewpoints, mobile perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity), is a generally recognized device used by the Cubists.&lt;ref name="David Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Cubism,+mobile+perspective&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm_znb7YtG&amp;sig=8jHfIJBskeVW31AU_0hqno0HLBY&amp;hl=fr#v=onepage&amp;q=Cubism%2C%20mobile%20perspective&amp;f=false David Cottington, 2004, ''Cubism and its Histories'', Manchester University Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101225927/https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Cubism,+mobile+perspective&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm_znb7YtG&amp;sig=8jHfIJBskeVW31AU_0hqno0HLBY&amp;hl=fr |date=2016-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1912 manifetso ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' by Metzinger and Gleizes was followed in 1913 by ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes]]'', a collection of reflections and commentaries by Guillaume Apollinaire.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire"&gt;Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Les Peintres cubistes: Méditations esthétiques'' (Paris, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; Apollinaire had been closely involved with Picasso beginning in 1905, and Braque beginning in 1907, but gave as much attention to artists such as Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Picabia, and Duchamp.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

{{main|Cubist sculpture}}

Just as in painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in Paul Cézanne's reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids (cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones). And just as in painting, it became a pervasive influence and contributed fundamentally to [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Futurism]].

Cubist sculpture developed in parallel to Cubist painting. During the autumn of 1909 Picasso sculpted ''Head of a Woman (Fernande)'' with positive features depicted by negative space and vice versa. According to Douglas Cooper: "The first true Cubist sculpture was Picasso's impressive ''Woman's Head'', modeled in 1909–10, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time."&lt;ref name="The Cubist Epoch" /&gt; These positive/negative reversals were ambitiously exploited by [[Alexander Archipenko]] in 1912–13, for example in ''Woman Walking''.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; [[Joseph Csaky]], after Archipenko, was the first sculptor in Paris to join the Cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 onwards. They were followed by [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and then in 1914 by [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henri Laurens]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Cubism," Readings in Art History 2 (1976), Seuphor, Sculpture of this Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;q=csaky#v=onepage&amp;q=csaky&amp;f=false Edith Balas, 1998, Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture, American Philosophical Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101225927/https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;q=csaky |date=2016-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Cubist construction was as influential as any pictorial Cubist innovation. It was the stimulus behind the proto-Constructivist work of both [[Naum Gabo]] and [[Vladimir Tatlin]] and thus the starting-point for the entire constructive tendency in 20th-century modernist sculpture.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

Cubism formed an important link between early-20th-century art and architecture.&lt;ref name="Blau &amp; Troy"&gt;[http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/projects/architecture-and-cubism-1.html Architecture and Cubism, Eve Blau, Nancy J. Troy, MIT Press/Canadian Centre for Architecture, 1997, pbk. 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509184139/http://gsd.harvard.edu/ |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical, theoretical, and socio-political relationships between avant-garde practices in painting, sculpture and architecture had early ramifications in [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. Though there are many points of intersection between Cubism and architecture, only a few direct links between them can be drawn. Most often the connections are made by reference to shared formal characteristics: faceting of form, spatial ambiguity, transparency, and multiplicity.&lt;ref name="Blau &amp; Troy" /&gt;

Architectural interest in Cubism centered on the dissolution and reconstitution of three-dimensional form, using simple geometric shapes, juxtaposed without the illusions of classical perspective. Diverse elements could be superimposed, made transparent or penetrate one another, while retaining their spatial relationships. Cubism had become an influential factor in the development of modern architecture from 1912 (''La Maison Cubiste'', by [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[André Mare]]) onwards, developing in parallel with architects such as [[Peter Behrens]] and [[Walter Gropius]], with the simplification of building design, the use of materials appropriate to industrial production, and the increased use of glass.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, Architecture"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020551#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, II.

Cubism was relevant to an architecture seeking a style that needed not refer to the past. Thus, what had become a revolution in both painting and sculpture was applied as part of "a profound reorientation towards a changed world".&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, Architecture" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. R. Banham. Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (London, 1960), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubo-Futurist ideas of [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] influenced attitudes in avant-garde architecture. The influential [[De Stijl]] movement embraced the aesthetic principles of Neo-plasticism developed by [[Piet Mondrian]] under the influence of Cubism in Paris. De Stijl was also linked by [[Gino Severini]] to Cubist theory through the writings of Albert Gleizes. However, the linking of basic geometric forms with inherent beauty and ease of industrial application—which had been prefigured by Marcel Duchamp from 1914—was left to the founders of [[Purism (arts)|Purism]], [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (better known as [[Le Corbusier]],) who exhibited paintings together in Paris and published ''Après le cubisme'' in 1918.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, Architecture" /&gt; Le Corbusier's ambition had been to translate the properties of his own style of Cubism to architecture. Between 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier concentrated his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, Le Corbusier and his cousin Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de Sèvres. His theoretical studies soon advanced into many different architectural projects.&lt;ref&gt;Choay, Françoise, ''le corbusier'' (1960), pp. 10-11.

At the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]] an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as ''Maison Cubiste'' (Cubist House), signed [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[André Mare]] along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', written during the assemblage of the "Maison Cubiste", wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the "antithesis of the picture". "The true picture" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, "bears its ''raison d'être'' within itself. It can be moved from a church to a [[drawing-room]], from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monographs/picmon/pdf/art_hum_reading_46.pdf Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinge, except from ''Du Cubisme'', 1912] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602141918/http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monographs/picmon/pdf/art_hum_reading_46.pdf |date=2013-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence", writes Christopher Green, "creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=%22maison+cubiste%22+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jv-hGOpwJc&amp;sig=0m8pM6Oi2mPGtmB6uB0Fe3s9YAQ&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22maison%20cubiste%22%201912&amp;f=false Christopher Green, ''Art in France: 1900-1940, Chapter 8, Modern Spaces; Modern Objects; Modern People, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130140743/https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=%22maison+cubiste%22+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jv-hGOpwJc&amp;sig=0m8pM6Oi2mPGtmB6uB0Fe3s9YAQ&amp;hl=en |date=2016-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Maison Cubiste'' was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room—the ''Salon Bourgeois'', where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (''Woman with a Fan''), Gleizes, Laurencin and Léger were hung—and a bedroom.

After the war, the architectural style called ''Rondo-Cubism'' was developed in Prague fusing the Cubist architecture with round shapes.&lt;ref name=czkubista&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech Cubism|url=http://www.kubista.cz/en/cubism/profiles.html#|website=www.kubista.cz|publisher=Kubista|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008123014/http://www.kubista.cz/en/cubism/profiles.html|archivedate=8 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:104 Vil·la Kovařovic (casa cubista), façana de Rašínovo Nábřeží.jpg|thumb|Villa Kovařovic in Prague by [[Josef Chochol]]]]
In their theoretical rules, the Cubist architects expressed the requirement of dynamism, which would surmount the matter and calm contained in it, through a creative idea, so that the result would evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in the viewer. This should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids, cubes and prisms, by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly triangular, sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units, reminiscent of the so-called [[diamond cut]], or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late [[Gothic architecture]]. In this way, the entire surfaces of the facades including even the gables and dormers are sculpted. The grilles as well as other architectural ornaments attain a three-dimensional form. Thus, new forms of windows and doors were also created, e. g. [[hexagonal window]]s.&lt;ref name=czkubista/&gt; Czech Cubist architects also designed Cubist furniture.

The leading Cubist architects were [[Pavel Janák]], [[Josef Gočár]], [[Vlastislav Hofman]], [[Emil Králíček]] and [[Josef Chochol]].&lt;ref name=czkubista/&gt; They worked mostly in Prague but also in other Bohemian towns. The best-known Cubist building is the [[House of the Black Madonna]] in the [[Old Town of Prague]] built in 1912 by Josef Gočár with the only Cubist café in the world, Grand Café Orient.&lt;ref name=bonek/&gt; Vlastislav Hofman built the entrance pavilions of [[Ďáblice cemetery|Ďáblice Cemetery]] in 1912–1914, Josef Chochol designed several residential houses under [[Vyšehrad]]. A Cubist streetlamp has also been preserved near the [[Wenceslas Square]], designed by Emil Králíček in 1912, who also built the Diamond House in the [[New Town of Prague]] around 1913.

==Cubism in other fields==
The influence of cubism extended to other artistic fields, outside painting and sculpture. In literature, the written works of [[Gertrude Stein]] employ repetition and repetitive phrases as building blocks in both passages and whole chapters. Most of Stein's important works utilize this technique, including the novel ''[[The Making of Americans]]'' (1906–08). Not only were they the first important patrons of Cubism, Gertrude Stein and her brother [[Leo Stein|Leo]] were also important influences on Cubism as well. Picasso in turn was an important influence on Stein's writing.

In the field of American fiction, [[William Faulkner]]'s 1930 novel ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' can be read as an interaction with the cubist mode. The novel features narratives of the diverse experiences of 15 characters which, when taken together, produce a single cohesive body.

The poets generally associated with Cubism are [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Max Jacob]], [[André Salmon]] and [[Pierre Reverdy]]. As American poet [[Kenneth Rexroth]] explains, Cubism in poetry "is the conscious, deliberate dissociation and recombination of elements into a new artistic entity made self-sufficient by its rigorous architecture. This is quite different from the free association of the Surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of Dada."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kenneth Rexroth |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/essays/reverdy.htm |title=The Cubist Poetry of Pierre Reverdy (Rexroth) |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519035242/http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/essays/reverdy.htm |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Cubist poets' influence on both Cubism and the later movements of [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] was profound; [[Louis Aragon]], founding member of Surrealism, said that for Breton, Soupault, Éluard and himself, Reverdy was "our immediate elder, the exemplary poet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reverdy |first=Pierre |url=http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852241543 |title=Title Page &gt; Pierre Reverdy: Selected Poems |publisher=Bloodaxe Books |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527200900/http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852241543 |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not as well remembered as the Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; American poets [[John Ashbery]] and [[Ron Padgett]] have recently produced new translations of [[Pierre Reverdy|Reverdy's]] work. [[Wallace Stevens]]' "[[Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird]]" is also said to demonstrate how cubism's multiple perspectives can be translated into poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070813070622/http://titan.iwu.edu/~wchapman/americanpoetryweb/stevthir.html Illinois Wesleyan University - The American Poetry Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

DaDaFest is funded by [[Arts Council England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/browse-regularly-funded-organisations/npo/dada-disability-deaf-arts/ |title= Arts Council Funding DaDaFest | website = artscouncil.org.uk |publisher=Arts Council England |date= |accessdate=12 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Liverpool City Council]] as well as other private and public sector partners.

==History==
DaDaFest was founded as ''Arts Integrated Merseyside'' (or AIM) as a part of the [[Shape Arts]] network in 1984. AIM was integral to the early campaign for greater equality and access for disabled people, but was not disability led.&lt;ref name="Case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disabilityarts.creativecase.org.uk/creativecase-DaDa-Disability-and-Deaf-Arts |title= DaDaFest Case Study |date= | website = disabilityarts.creativecase.org.uk | publisher = Disability Arts: Creative Case |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[John McGrath (artistic director)|John McGrath]] as its Development Officer,&lt;ref name="DA_online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/chronology_disability_arts_1976_1989 |title= Disability Arts Chronology &amp;nbsp; 1976 - 1989: (1986) |date= 16 January 2009 | website = disabilityartsonline.org.uk | publisher = Disability Arts Online |accessdate= 2 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J_McGrath"&gt;{{cite web| title = Interview: Under the Skin with John McGrath | url = http://www.dadafest.co.uk/2017/01/interview-under-the-skin-with-john-mcgrath/ | website = dadafest.co.uk | publisher = DaDaFest | date = 23 January 2017 |accessdate= 2 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the organisation became one of the UK's first disability control-led arts forums after it broke away from the [[Shape Arts|Shape Network]] and set itself up as ''North West Disability Arts Forum'' (NWDAF) in 1986. It was formally constituted in 1990,&lt;ref name="Case" /&gt; with [[Mandy Colleran]] becoming its director.&lt;ref name="DA_online2"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bidder | first = Joe |title= Ruth Gould: Creative Force in Disability Arts |url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/profile_of_ruth_gould | website = disabilityartsonline.org.uk | publisher = Disability Arts Online |date= 8 May 2008 | accessdate= 6 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation eventually re-branded itself to 'DaDa - Disability and Deaf Arts' in 2008 and again to 'DaDaFest' in 2012.

DaDaFest delivered its first international festival in 2001 and continued to put on yearly festivals until 2010 when it became a biennial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1906">'''De Brug van Willebroek''' (''The Bridge of Willebroek'') is a 1990 song by [[Wannes Van de Velde]] about the bridge near the [[Brussels–Scheldt Maritime Canal]] in the Flemish village [[Willebroek]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hln.be/regio/willebroek/de-brug-der-zuchten-in-een-handvol-weetjes~a81ae975/&lt;/ref&gt; The song has also been covered by the Antwerp band [[Katastroof]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.katastroof.be/muziek/de-brug-van-willebroek&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyrics==

The lyrics describe a man who has two appointments, one at the royal palace, another with [[Jane Fonda]] and yet another with the Flemish government who offer him a position in the Ministry of Culture. Yet he fails to get at each of these appointments, because he has to cross the canal and the bridge happens to be closed every time he reaches it. It frustrates him so much that he calls it a "monster van ijzer and staal" ("a monster of iron and steel"). The final lyrics have him reflect that if God ever tells him it's time to die he'll try to go the bridge of Willebroek, so he'll have an excuse why he was late. 

==In popular culture==

The song is used as a waiting tune for the telephone lines of the city council of [[Willebroek]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/4n3ir2n0&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hln.be/regio/willebroek/de-brug-der-zuchten-in-een-handvol-weetjes~a81ae975/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 there was talk of raising a statue of Van de Velde near the bridge of Willebroek, but his family vetoed the idea. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/4n3ir2n0&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gva.be/cnt/aid1094277/geen-monument-voor-wannes-van-de-velde-bij-brug-van-willebroek-2&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Double church''',&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"/&gt; or '''twin church''',&lt;ref name="Mihaljević"/&gt; is a church design found in [[Byzantine architecture]]. The double church design of the [[Üçayak Byzantine Church]]  features double [[nave]]s standing side by side and separated by a common wall. The twin church design at Üçayak has two [[nave]]s each with a separate semi-circular [[apse]].

[[File:Eadwine psalter - Morgan leaf M.521 (recto) (cropped, Dives and Lazarus).jpg|thumb|Detail from the prefatory cycle; the [[parable]] of [[Dives and Lazarus]]]]

The '''Eadwine Psalter''' or '''Eadwin Psalter''' is a heavily illuminated 12th-century [[psalter]] named after the scribe Eadwine, a monk of [[Christ Church, Canterbury]] (now [[Canterbury Cathedral]]), who was perhaps the "project manager" for the large and exceptional book. The manuscript belongs to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (MS R.17.1) and is kept in the [[Wren Library]].  It contains the [[Book of Psalms]] in three languages: three versions in Latin, with [[Old English]] &amp; [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] translations, and has been called the most ambitious manuscript produced in England in the twelfth century.  As far as the images are concerned, most of the book is an adapted copy, using a more contemporary style, of the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] [[Utrecht Psalter]], which was at [[Canterbury]] for a period in the Middle Ages. There is also a very famous full-page miniature showing Eadwine at work, which is highly unusual and possibly a self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry; Trinity Coll., MS. R.17.1; on its fame: Ross, 45; Karkov, 299&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, there is a prefatory cycle of four folios, so eight pages, fully decorated with a series of miniatures in compartments showing the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', with parables and some [[Old Testament]] scenes.  These pages, and perhaps at least one other, were removed from the main manuscript at some point and are now in the [[British Library]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (with one each), and two in the [[Morgan Library]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry: "New York, Morgan Lib., MSS M.521 and M.724; London, BL, MS. Add. 37472; London, V&amp;A, MS. 661"&lt;/ref&gt;

It was produced around the mid-century, perhaps 1155–60,&lt;ref&gt;Karkov, 289; Gibson, 209&lt;/ref&gt;  and perhaps in two main campaigns of work, one in the 1150s and the other the decade after.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry&lt;/ref&gt;  It was sometimes called the "Canterbury Psalter" in the past, as in the 1935 [[monograph]] by [[M. R. James]], but this is now avoided, if only to avoid confusion with other manuscripts, including the closely related [[Harley Psalter]] and the [[Great Canterbury Psalter]] (or Anglo-Catalan Psalter, Paris Psalter), which are also copies made in Canterbury of the Utrecht Psalter.

==Contents==
===Text===
[[File:ChristamsStoryBLAddMS37472Fol1r.jpg|thumb|The [[Nativity of Jesus]] on the recto of the British Library page]]
The book is large, with 281 vellum folios or leaves (two-sided) in Cambridge, measuring an average {{convert|455|x|326|mm}}.&lt;ref&gt;PUEM&lt;/ref&gt;  The four detached leaves have presumably been trimmed and are now  400–405&amp;nbsp;mm x 292–300&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;Zarnecki, 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; The texts are: "a calendar, triple Metrical Psalms ... canticles, two continuous commentaries, two prognostications".&lt;ref&gt;PUEM&lt;/ref&gt;

The three main different [[Latin Psalters|Latin versions of the Psalms]] are given side by side.  In the order they occur on the [[verso]] pages, these are the "Gallican" version, a translation from the Greek [[Septuagint]] which was used by most of the Western church, the "Roman", the Gallican version as corrected by [[Saint Jerome]] from the [[Hebrew Bible]], which was used by churches in Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Trinity&lt;/ref&gt;  but was also an Anglo-Saxon favourite, especially at Canterbury.&lt;ref&gt;Karkov, 292&lt;/ref&gt; Last comes the "Hebrew" version, or ''Versio juxta Hebraicum'', Jerome's translation from the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Trinity&lt;/ref&gt;  The columns reverse their sequence on recto pages, so that the Gallican column, which has a larger text size, is always nearest the edge of the page, and the Hebrew nearest the bound edge.&lt;ref&gt;Trinity&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the lines of the text of the psalms, the "Hebrew" version has a translation into contemporary [[Norman-French]], which represents the oldest surviving text of the psalms in French, the "Roman" version has a translation into [[Old English]], and the "Gallican" version has Latin notes.&lt;ref&gt;Trinity&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hebrew version was "a scholarly rather than a liturgical text", and related more to continental scholarly interests, especially those at [[Fleury Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;Karkov, 292&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of Psalters with comparable Latin texts, and a number of luxury illuminated psalters, but the combination in a single manuscript of the scholarly ''psalterium triplex'' with a very large programme of illumination, and translations into two vernacular languages, is unique.&lt;ref&gt;See Karkov, 292, PUEM on multi-lingual MS., and Gibson, 26 on prefatory cycles in pasalters.&lt;/ref&gt;  The psalter was "a tool for study and teaching" rather than a display manuscript for the altar.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 338&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old English translation contains a number of errors which "have been explained as the result of uncritical copying of an archaic text at a time when the language was no longer in current use".&lt;ref&gt;Zarnecki, 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illumination===
The manuscript is the most extensively decorated 12th-century English manuscript. There are 166 pen drawings with watercolour (a traditional Anglo-Saxon style), based on their counterparts in ''Utrecht'', which lack colour.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 25; Dodwell, 338&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also the four painted leaves, now detached, with the biblical cycle, with some 130 scenes; there may have been at least one more page originally.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 25&lt;/ref&gt;  These may be referred to as the "Picture Leaves".&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 26, 43&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the book there is the full-page portrait of Eadwine, followed by drawings with colour showing Christ Church, Canterbury and its water channels, one over a full opening, and the other more schematic and on a single page.  These are thought to be at least afterthoughts, added to what were intended as blank flyleaves, as found in a number of other manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 357&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the text very many initials are decorated, with over 500 "major" initials fully painted with gold highlights, mostly at the first letter of each of the three text versions of each psalm.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The prefatory miniature cycle is divided stylistically. Of the eight pages, six and a half are in one style, but most of the Victoria and Albert folio in another. This is usually thought to mark a change of artist. The two styles can be related to those of the [[St Albans Psalter]] and the [[Lambeth Bible]] respectively.  Though comparison with the ''Utrecht''-derived images in Cambridge is complicated by the different technique and the many stylistic features retained from the original, the first artist seems closest to these.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 25–27, 59–60; Dodwell, 336–338&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of such a cycle was already about, and one key exemplar was probably the 6th-century Italian [[St Augustine Gospels]], a key relic of the founder of the cathedral's rival [[St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury]], where it then was, though it has also since found its way to a Cambridge college. This has one surviving page (of an original three, at least) with compartmented scenes of the life of Christ, which include many miracles and incidents from the ministry of Jesus rarely depicted by the High Middle Ages.  The ''Eadwine'' pages include one of these scenes, from the start of Luke 9, 58 (and Matthew 8, 20): "et ait illi Iesus vulpes foveas habent et volucres caeli nidos Filius autem hominis non habet ubi caput reclinet" – "Jesus said to him: The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests: but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 29; Dodwell, 338&lt;/ref&gt;  For the [[iconography]] of the prefatory cycle, see below.

The copies of ''Utrecht'' images are compressed to fit the different format, but generally rather close. However, the sense of the landscape setting suffers considerably. [[Kenneth Clark]] commented that "the Utrecht Psalter is full of landscape motives taken from Hellenistic painting, and its impressionistic scribbles still imply a sense of light and space. There is no simpler way to show the triumph of symbol over sensation in the middle ages than to compare its pages with [their Eadwine Psalter equivalents]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]], ''Landscape into Art'', 1949, p. 17 (in Penguin edn of 1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eadwine and his portrait==
[[File:Unknown-artist-eadwine-the-scribe-at-work-eadwine-psalter-christ-church-canterbury-england-uk-circa-1160-70.jpg|thumb|Eadwine at his desk]]
[[File:Eadwine psalter - Waterworks in Canterbury.jpg|thumb|The large Canterbury waterworks plan, f.284v-285r]]
It is unclear who Eadwine was and what role he played in the creation of the manuscript; the documentary traces of monastic Eadwines (and Edwins and Adwins etc) of about the right time and place are few, and hard to fit to the facts and statements of the manuscript.  The inscription around the portrait declares that he is ''sriptorum princeps'' (sic), "prince of scribes" (or "first among scribes"),&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kaufmann]] in Zarnecki, 119 translates as "prince"; below P. Heslop as "chief"&lt;/ref&gt; so he was probably one of the many scribes working on the manuscript, but probably also playing the main role in deciding the contents and organizing the work.  He may also have paid for it, though he was certainly not the [[prior]] of Canterbury at the time, as these are all known, and  Wybert or Wibert (r. 1153–1167) was prior for the most likely periods for the book's creation.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 184; Ross, Chapter 3; Karkov, 289; Dodwell, 355–359&lt;/ref&gt;

His portrait is clearly of the conventional type of an [[author portrait]], at this period most often seen in [[evangelist portrait]]s at the start of the [[Gospel]]s. These look right or forward to the pages following containing their work. Eadwine's is placed at the end of the book, after the text, so he looks left, back over it.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 183–184; Karkov, 299–300&lt;/ref&gt;

As recorded by [[M. R. James]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The following inscription in green and red capitals surrounds the picture beginning at the top on L.
SCRIPTOR (supply loquitur). SRIPTORUM (sic) PRINCEPS EGO NEC OBITURA DEINCEPS
LAVS MEA NEC FAMA. QVIS SIM MEA LITTERA CLAMA.
LITTERA. TE TVA SRIPTVRA QUEM SIGNAT PICTA FIGURA Ɵ-
(top L. again). -Ɵ PREDICAT EADWINVM FAMA PER SECULA VIVUM.
INGENIUM CVIVS LIBRI DECUS INDICAT HVIVS.
QVEM TIBI SEQUE DATVM MVNVS DEUS ACCIPE GRATVM."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

which translates as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Scribe: I am the chief of scribes, and neither my praise nor fame shall die; shout out, oh my letter, who I may be.  Letter: By its fame your script proclaims you, Eadwine, whom the painted figure represents, alive through the ages, whose genius the beauty of this book demonstrates. Receive, O God, the book and its donor as an acceptable gift.&lt;ref&gt;Translation by P. Heslop in Gibson, p.180, quoted by Karkov, 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The portrait, and the waterworks drawings that follow it, have sometimes been seen as later additions, though more recent scholarship is moving away from this view.&lt;ref&gt;Karkov, 299–301, 304–306&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait might then be a memorial added to commemorate a notable figure of the monastery in a book he had been closely associated with,&lt;ref&gt;Karkov, 304–306; Ross, 49; Dodwell, 357 argues against this&lt;/ref&gt; with the waterworks drawings also acting as a memorial to Prior Wibert, who had done considerable work on the water system.  Some scholars see both aspects of the script and the portrait as evoking [[Eadwig Basan]], the most famous of English scribes (and perhaps also the artist of the miniatures in his manuscripts), who was a monk at Christ Church Canterbury over a century earlier, in the last decades of Anglo-Saxon England.&lt;ref&gt;Karkov, 295–299; Gibson, 24, 85–87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scribes, artists and history==
At least ten scribes contributed to the texts, at least five of them contributing to the Old English text, and at least six artists, who may overlap with the scribes. It is difficult to tell many of these apart.&lt;ref&gt;PUEM, Karkov, 289, who has been followed where counts differ.&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems likely that Eadwine contributed to the scribing, but his hand cannot be confidently identified.  However, at least according to T. A. Heslop, the bulk of the illumination, over 80% of the prefatory cycle and over 90% of the miniatures in the psalms and canticles, is by a single artist, who he calls the "Principal Illuminator".&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 59&lt;/ref&gt;  To Heslop, the diverse styles and limited "guest appearances" of the other artists suggests that they are mobile laymen employed for the task by the monastery, of the sort who were even at this early date beginning to take over the illumination of manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The dating of the manuscript has been much discussed, mainly on stylistic grounds (regarding both the script and the illustrations), within the broad range 1130–1170. On folio 10 there is a marginal drawing of a [[comet]], with a note in Old English (in which it is a "hairy star") that it is an [[augury]]; following the comet of 1066 the English evidently took comets seriously. This was thought to relate to the appearance of [[Halley's Comet]] in 1145, but another of 14 May 1147 is recorded in the Christ Church Annals, and the 1145 one is not. There were further comets recorded in 1165 and 1167, so the evidence from astronomy has not settled the question.  Such a large undertaking would have taken many years to complete; the Anglo-Catalan Psalter was left unfinished in England, like many other ambitious manuscript projects.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 338–340; Gibson, 61, 164&lt;/ref&gt;

The current broad consensus is to date most of the book to 1155–60, but the portrait of Eadwine and the waterworks drawings to perhaps a decade later.&lt;ref&gt;Karkov, 289; V&amp;A; Gerry; PUEM; Dodwell, 357 – some with variations of phrasing&lt;/ref&gt;  The large waterworks drawing shows the cathedral as it was before the major fire of 1174, which provoked the introduction of [[Gothic architecture]] to the cathedral, when [[William of Sens]] was brought in to rebuild the choir.  The period also saw the momentous murder of [[Thomas Becket]] in 1170, and his rapid canonization as a saint in 1173; however his feast day is not included in the calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 357&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is included in the catalogue of the library of Christ Church made in Prior Eastry's inventory in the early fourteenth-century. It was given by Thomas Nevile, Dean of Canterbury Cathedral, to Trinity College, Cambridge in the early seventeenth-century, presumably without the prefatory folios, which are thought to have been removed around this time.  The binding is 17th-century.&lt;ref&gt;PUEM; V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eadwine psalter - Morgan leaf M.521 (recto).jpg|thumb|Morgan leaf M.521 (recto); miracles and [[parables of Jesus]].  The last square has the story of the [[Prodigal Son]] in 8 scenes.]]

By the early 19th century the detached folios were in the collection of [[William Young Ottley]], the [[British Museum]]'s print curator and a significant art collector, but no admirer of medieval art.  At the sale in 1838, after his death in 1836, the sheets were individual lots and bought by different buyers.&lt;ref&gt;Zarnecki, 111–112&lt;/ref&gt;  The Victoria and Albert Museum's sheet fetched two guineas (£2 and 2 shillings). It was bought by the museum in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt; One of the two sheets in the [[Morgan Library]] passed through various hands and was bought by [[J.P. Morgan]] in 1911 and the other was added in 1927, after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Library CORSAIR online entries, [http://corsair.themorgan.org/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=3&amp;ti=1,3&amp;Search_Arg=Eadwine&amp;Search_Code=GKEY^&amp;CNT=50&amp;PID=PgfzIPPu7ObXyTAQ4n8qSqLOZ6&amp;SEQ=20150630170954&amp;SID=1 M521] and [http://corsair.themorgan.org/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=4&amp;ti=1,4&amp;Search_Arg=Eadwine&amp;Search_Code=GKEY^&amp;CNT=50&amp;PID=PgfzIPPu7ObXyTAQ4n8qSqLOZ6&amp;SEQ=20150630170954&amp;SID=1 M724]; Zarnecki, 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Museum]] bought their sheet in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Zarnecki, 111&lt;/ref&gt;

All the surviving parts of the original manuscript were reunited in the exhibition ''English Romanesque Art, 1066–1200'' in London in 1984, though the catalogue entries, by [[Michael Kauffmann]], did not relate the loose sheets to the main Cambridge manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;Zarnecki, #s 47–50, 62&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Hanns Swarzenski]] in 1938 and [[C. R. Dodwell]] in 1954 had already proposed this.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenes in the prefatory miniatures==
[[File:Eadwine psalter - Morgan leaf M.521 (recto) (cropped Prodigal Son).jpg|thumb|Morgan leaf M.521 (recto), detail with the story of the [[Prodigal son]]]]
These pages "contain by far the largest New Testament cycle produced in England or anywhere else in the 12th century", with some 150 scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Zarnecki, 111&lt;/ref&gt;   The emphasis on the miracles and parables of Christ was most untypical in Romanesque cycles in general, which concentrated almost exclusively on the events commemorated by the feast days of the liturgical calendar. [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] cycles such as that in the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] still show the miracles and parables, but the cycle here has more scenes than any Ottonian one. Sources for the selection of scenes are probably considerably older than the 12th century, and might possibly go back as far as the St Augustine Gospels, of about 600, which were then at Canterbury, and no doubt more complete than now, or a similar very early cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Zarnecki, 111–112; V&amp;A. However Dodwell, 336–337 allows for a good deal of originality from the Canterbury artists.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand George Henderson argued that the cycle may have been planned specially for the Eadwine Psalter, based on direct reading of the bible, with the New Testament scenes sometimes "following the sequence of a particular gospel, at times constructing an intelligent first-hand synthesis of more than one gospel."&lt;ref&gt;in Gibson, 35–42&lt;/ref&gt;

There is usually thought to have been a fifth sheet covering the [[Book of Genesis]], especially as there is one in the Great Canterbury/[[Anglo-Catalan Psalter]], which has a closely similar cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Zarnecki, 111&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis on the life of [[David]], who appears in 5 scenes, as well as the Tree of Jesse, is appropriate for the figure regarded as the author of the psalms.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 336&lt;/ref&gt;

All the pages use a basic framework of twelve square compartments divided by borders, which may contain a single scene, or several. In the latter case, usually they are divided horizontally to give two wide spaces.  Within these two or more scenes may be contained without formally interrupting the picture space. The scenes shown can be summarized as:&lt;ref&gt;Zarnecki, 111–112, lists all of them&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan Library, M 724&lt;ref&gt;Morgan&lt;/ref&gt;
*Recto: 12 squares, several with more than 1 scene. 1–7 are the story of [[Moses]], including ''Moses trampling on Pharaoh's Crown'', "a Jewish legend popularized by [[Josephus]]". 8 is [[Joshua]], 9–12 [[Saul]] and David
*Verso: 7 scenes, six squares and a large compartment. 1–2 David. 3 a large compartment with a [[Tree of Jesse]], which includes the [[Annunciation]], Annunciation to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]], and the wedding of Mary and Joseph. 4 [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], 5–6 Birth and naming of [[John the Baptist]], 7 Nativity of Jesus.

British Library
*Recto: 12 scenes completing the Nativity cycle, from the [[Annunciation to the Shepherds]] to [[Herod the Great#.22Suicide.22 of Herod|Herod's suicide]], an uncommon scene (and a medieval distortion of [[Josephus]]).
*Verso: 12 squares, some with 2 scenes, all showing the ministry of Jesus, from the [[Baptism of Jesus]] to the [[Raising of Jairus' daughter]]

Morgan Library, M 521&lt;ref&gt;Morgan&lt;/ref&gt;
*Recto: 12 squares, but each with at least two scenes, all with miracles and [[parables of Jesus]].  The last (bottom right) square has the story of the [[Prodigal Son]] in 8 scenes, the bottom centre the story of [[Dives and Lazarus]] in four.
*Verso: 12 squares, but each with at least two scenes: 1–7 miracles and parables. 8 [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]], 9–12 Passion to the [[Arrest of Jesus]]

Victoria and Albert Museum

*Recto: 12 squares, most with two scenes: the Passion continues to the [[Deposition of Christ]]
*Verso: 12 squares, most with two scenes: the burial through to the Ascension and [[Pentecost]], though there is no Resurrection scene as such, a sign of the early origin of this choice of scenes.

'''Emamzadeh Haroun-e-Velayat''' ({{lang-fa|امامزاده هارون ولایت}}) is an [[imamzadeh]] in [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]]. It is located opposite [[Ali minaret]] and belongs to the [[Ismail I]] era. There are many relations about the person, who is buried in it. Some say that he is [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|the sixth Imam]]'s son and some others say, he is [[Ali al-Hadi|the tenth Imam]]'s son, but aside from the matter, who is buried in it, it is the most important historical structure related to the early [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid era]]. Beyond the [[tomb]] it has also a [[portico]], a [[tile]]d [[dome]] and a large yard. It seems that some repairments and improvements have been done in the [[Fath-Ali Shah Qajar|Fath-Ali Shah]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rāhnamā ye Safar be Ostān e Esfāhān(Travel Guide for the Province Isfahan)|publisher=Rouzane|isbn=964-334-218-2|author=Hosseyn Yaghoubi|editor=Arash Beheshti|page=114|language=Persian|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Emamzadeh Panje Shah''' is an [[imamzadeh]] in [[Kashan]], [[Iran]]. The imamzadeh has been a sacred place since the early [[islam]]ic centuries. It was also in the past one of the safest sanctuary places and if a criminal had taken sanctuary in the imamzadeh, nobody dared to take him out by force. The Emamzadeh Panje Shah belongs to the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuq]] era, but its internal decorations belong mostly to the [[Qajar]] era. this structure is apparently the buried place of one of the [[Musa al-Kadhim]]'s son. It has a [[conical]] [[dome]], a yard, an [[iwan]], several [[portico]]es and a big wooden [[sepulcher]].&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 189"&gt;'{{cite book|first=Hosseyn |last=Yaghoubi|title=Rāhnamā ye Safar be Ostān e Esfāhān |trans-title=Travel Guide for the Province Isfahan|publisher=Rouzane|isbn=964-334-218-2|editor-first=Beheshti |editor-last=Arash|page=189|language=Persian|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[minaret]] beside the northern [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] of the yard. The entrance of the [[tomb]] has an [[marbly]] [[inscription]]. On the inscription, it has been written an [[ode]] for praising the buried Imamzadeh. There are also other old [[grave]]s in the structure. Two of them are on the both sides of the [[portico]]. It is said that one of the graves belongs to the [[Malik al-Ashtar]]'s daughter, Safieh Khatun.&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 189"/&gt;

'''Hacks''' at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] are [[practical joke]]s and [[student prank|pranks]] meant to prominently demonstrate technical aptitude and cleverness, or to commemorate popular culture and historical topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Boston Globe |date=April 1, 2003 |department=C |title=These Are Not Your Ordinary College Pranks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MH"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Miami Herald |date=April 10, 2002 |department=4E Living |title=Elaborate Practice Jokes Make the Grade at MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DMN"&gt;{{cite news|title= Scholarly MIT celebrates its crazier side |date=April 29, 1991 |publisher=Dallas Morning News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hacks and Smoots"&gt;{{cite news|title=Of Hacks and Smoot: MIT Students Have Engineered Campus Pranks since 1876 |publisher=Boston Globe |last=Gaine |first=Judith |date=April 1, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;{{cite news|title=MIT students exhibit ingenuity, humor |department=C |date=May 16, 1991 |last=Abell |first=John |publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/01/technology/screen-grab-fun-for-pranksters.html?scp=1&amp;sq=mit+hack&amp;st=nyt |title=Fun for Pranksters |publisher=The New York Times |first=Sreenath |last=Sreenivasan |date=April 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pranks are anonymously installed at night by '''hackers''', usually, but not exclusively, undergraduate students.

Although the practice is unsanctioned by the university, and students have sometimes been arraigned on trespassing charges for hacking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1031/p02s03-ussc.html |title=Campus pranks now come with permission slips |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |first=Tom |last=Peter |date=October 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutors drop charges again 3 MIT students in prank case |date=February 28, 2007 |first=John |last=Ellement |publisher=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hackers skirt security in late-night MIT treks |publisher=Boston Globe |date=March 30, 2000 |last=Abel |first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; hacks have substantial significance to MIT's history and student culture.  Student bloggers working for the MIT Admissions Office have often written about MIT hacks, including those occurring during Campus Preview Weekend (CPW), an event welcoming admitted prospective freshman students.&lt;ref name=AdmissionsBlog&gt;{{cite web|title=CPW 2008: The Hack Edition|url=http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/life/hacks_traditions/cpw_2008_the_hack_edition.shtml|website=Explore &amp; discover MIT: Blogs|publisher=MIT Admissions Office|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alumni bloggers on the MIT Alumni Association website also report and document some of the more memorable hacks.&lt;ref name=MITAA-Hacks&gt;{{cite web|title=Entries tagged with "hacks"|url=http://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/tag/hacks/|website=Slice of MIT: News &amp; Views for the Alumni Community|publisher=MIT Alumni Association|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the mid-1970s, the student-written guide ''How To Get Around MIT (HowToGAMIT)'' has included a chapter on hacking, and discusses history, hacker groups, ethics, safety tips, and risks of the activity.&lt;ref name=HTG&gt;{{cite book|title=How To Get Around MIT (HowToGAMIT)|year=2010–2011|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-9760779-6-1|pages=150–156|edition=39th|chapter=Hacking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a decade, the [[MIT Museum]] included a "Hall of Hacks" featuring famous MIT hacks, but the section was closed in 2001,&lt;ref name=HallHacks&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnaout|first=Rima|title=Museum's Hall of Hacks Concludes Ten-Year Run|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V121/N10/10hacks.10n.html|website=The Tech|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily returning for a 2003 exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2003/08/24/at_mit_how_the_hack_they_did_it/ |title=At MIT, how the hack they did it |last=Hurley |first=Mary |publisher=Boston Globe |date=August 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the display space was reallocated to the ''MIT 150'' exhibition, a year-long show commemorating MIT's 150th anniversary.&lt;ref name=MIT150&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT 150: 150 ideas, inventions, and innovators that helped shape our world|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/specials/mit150/|website=boston.com|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hacks were not featured in the exhibit, certain student activities such as the [[Traditions and student activities at MIT#Baker House Piano Drop|Annual Baker House Piano Drop]] were featured in the exhibition.&lt;ref name=MIT150Hacks&gt;{{cite web|title=Hackers' delight -- A history of MIT pranks|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/gallery/100308_mit_hacks/|website=boston.com|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Museum's extensive collection of hacker artifacts and documentation continues to be preserved and expanded, with a selection of larger relics from past hacks plus explanatory panels and plaques semi-permanently displayed inside the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]].  This mini-exhibit on hacks is located on the ground floor of the Stata Center, near the cafeteria at the southeastern end of the complex, and may be viewed by visitors during normal office hours.&lt;ref name=StataHacks&gt;[https://archive.is/20121212181253/http://alum.mit.edu/sliceofmit/2009/03/25/stata-look-and-feel/ Stata Look and Feel « Slice of MIT by the Alumni Association].

Famous hacks include a weather balloon labeled "MIT" appearing at the 50-yard line at the [[Harvard–Yale football rivalry|Harvard/Yale football game]] in 1982, the placing of a campus police cruiser on the roof of the Great Dome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MIT answers the siren call of a good joke |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=May 10, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; converting the Great Dome into [[R2-D2]] or a large yellow ring to acknowledge the release of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|Star Wars Episode I]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|Lord of the Rings]]'' respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Boston Globe |last=Abel |first=David |date=May 23, 2001 |title=Weight of finals explains MIT prank: 'Hack' on dome gets high grade}}&lt;/ref&gt; or placing full-sized replicas of the [[Wright Flyer]] and a fire truck to acknowledge the anniversaries of first powered controlled flight and the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th attacks]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Firetruck"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/09/mit_hacks_mark_1.html |title=MIT 'hacks' mark Sept. 11 with a fake fire truck |date=September 11, 2006 |publisher=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At MIT, the terms ''hack'' and ''hacker'' have many shades of meaning,&lt;ref name=JargonFile&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric|title=The Meaning of 'Hack'|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/meaning-of-hack.html|website=The Jargon File (version 4.4.7)|accessdate=2011-05-03|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HHH&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Sam|title=Hack, Hackers, and Hacking|url=http://www.faifzilla.org/appendixb.html|website=FAIFzilla.org [website]|publisher=Sam Williams|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HackDefinitionBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork: a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=5–6|chapter=Hack, hacker, hacking; A short history of the terminology}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they are closely linked historically and culturally with [[Hacker (term)|computer hacking]] (in its original non-[[Hacker (computer security)|computer-cracker]] sense), collegiate [[practical joke]]s, and even [[culture jamming]].  The origin of this usage is unknown, but it seems to have been widespread at MIT by the 1960s, and the [[hacker ethic]] has since spread into [[cyberculture]] and beyond.  Over time, the term has been generalized to describe anybody who possesses great technical proficiency in any particular skill, usually combined with an offbeat sense of humor.  The manifestation of hacker culture in the form of spectacular pranks is the most visible aspect of this culture to the world at large, but many hacker subcultures exist at MIT, and elsewhere.  This article focuses mostly on prankish aspects; for a fuller description of hacker culture, see "[[Hacker (term)]]".

[[Roof and tunnel hacking]], a form of [[urban exploration]], is also related to but not identical to "hacking" as described in this article.  Some hacks do involve overcoming barriers to physical access (e.g. placing a half-scale [[Apollo Lunar Module]] atop the Great Dome),&lt;ref name=ApolloHack&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo Lunar Module on the Great Dome|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2009/apollo_lander/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but many other stunts do not require such specialized skills.

==Cultural aspects==
Viewed from an [[anthropology|anthropological]] perspective, hacking is a cultural tradition affirming [[social cohesion|group solidarity]], but some hacks can also be viewed as individualistic creative or [[artistic expression]].  For example the "Massachusetts Toolpike" hack&lt;ref name=Tech11040&gt;{{cite web|last=Mehta|first=Prabhat|title=Journal of IHTFP a joyful account of MIT hacks|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V110/N40/hacks.40a.html|website=The Tech|accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was a clear instance of [[installation art]]&lt;ref name=GnomeInfestationWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Gnome Infestation|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2003/gnomes/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KeypadArtWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Cluster keypad artwork|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2003/keypad_art/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or [[environmental art]].&lt;ref name=RockGardenHackWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Squanch Rock Garden in 2-4-6 Courtyard|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2000/tetazoo_garden/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hacks which involve staged public actions&lt;ref name=BOYD&gt;{{cite web|title=Bring out your Dead|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1996/dead/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PerfHackWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance Hacks|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_topic/performance.html|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PerfHackBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

"Tribute", "memorial", or "commemorative" hacks note the arrival, passing, or anniversary of some noteworthy person, tradition, institution, or idea (e.g. the 10th anniversary of Wikipedia).&lt;ref name=Wiki10th&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia 10th Anniversary|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2011/wikipedia/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another broad category of hacks contains strong elements of [[social commentary]] or [[demonstration (people)|street protest]] (e.g. "Nth Annual Spontaneous Tuition Riot"&lt;ref name=TechTuition&gt;{{cite web|last=Chung|first=Jennifer|title=Students Protest Tuition Hike During Traditional Annual Riot|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V119/PDF/N12.pdf|website=The Tech|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) about events on campus or in the world at large.  But the strongest element of many hacks is the sheer joy of conceptualizing something new, and then reifying it with effective engineering, both technical and social (e.g. installing a full-sized mockup solar-powered subway car on the parapet wall around the base of the Great Dome, and then ''driving it back and forth under remote wireless control'' from Killian Court, some five stories below, ''after sundown'').&lt;ref name=SolarSubwayWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Powered Subway Car on the Great Dome|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2009/solar_powered_subway/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SolarSubwayBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.F.|title=Nightwork: a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=13, 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a traditional courtesy to leave a note or even engineering drawings behind, as an aid to safe de-installation of a hack.&lt;ref name="HackCSRTBook"/&gt;  Sometimes, the hacks have been de-installed so quickly that members of the MIT community and the general public have had little opportunity to view them.

The [[MIT Museum]] maintains an extensive collection of original hacker artifacts and documentation, and displays some larger items semi-permanently in the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]].&lt;ref name="StataHacks"/&gt;

Although many traditional college pranks have involved maximizing embarrassment or inconvenience for a victim or target, such antics are usually disparaged by MIT hackers as "unimaginative" or "boring".  Often the target of a hack is an abstract concept (e.g. [[bureaucracy]] or "[[political correctness]]", or [[entropy]]), and the prank may or may not be aimed at any specific individual.  Even when an individual is targeted (e.g. the "disappearing office"&lt;ref name=VestOffice&gt;{{cite web|title=The Disappearing President's Office (The Bulletin Board Hack)|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1990/vest_bboard/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TechVest&gt;{{cite web|title=Moving the Institute forward into the next century, Charles Vest thinks globally|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V110/N43/vest.43n.html|website=The Tech|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of newly arrived MIT President [[Charles Marstiller Vest|Charles Vest]]), the jest is good-natured, often eliciting admiration rather than anger from the "victim".

Writers for the third-party, independent Internet prankster site ''Zug'' once compared humorous responses at MIT and Harvard, by posting similar banners over main entrances to their respective campuses which proclaimed "Institute of Nowlege".  Regarding Harvard, they concluded, "The question: is the sense of humor still alive in modern-day Harvard students? The answer, it turns out, is ''no''."  Regarding MIT, they said, "So it's official: MIT students have a better sense of humor, hands down, than Harvard students. MIT students are more imaginative, more fun-loving, and probably smarter as well.  Truly, MIT is the Institute of NOWLEGE."  The ''Zug'' pranksters also noted and documented great differences in the reactions of [[campus police]], maintenance workers, and passersby, upon seeing the ironically [[pun]]ned banners.&lt;ref name=ZugHarvardMIT&gt;{{cite web|last=Hargrave |first=John |title=Harvard vs. MIT: Who Has the Better Sense of Humor? |url=http://www.zug.com/pranks/harvard-vs-mit/index.html |website=Zug: Prank You Very Much |publisher=Media Shower, Inc. |accessdate=2011-05-12 |author2=Mike Hoban |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104202203/http://www.zug.com/pranks/harvard-vs-mit/index.html |archivedate=January 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT hacks can push the limits of technical skill, and sometimes fail in spite of meticulous planning.  Even these engineering failures have been acknowledged to have educational value, and sometimes a follow-up attempt succeeds. One hack on the Great Dome is documented as having finally succeeded on the fourth try, after a complete re-engineering of both the installed artifact and the installation method.&lt;ref name=HackNippleBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork : a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=56–57|chapter=Domework: hacking the domes; Dome as dais; The great breast of knowledge, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller projects that can be completed by an individual student are sometimes accorded the honorific "a great hack" by other students, if they combine technical elegance with a hackish sense of humor.  For example, an MIT undergrad transformed an ordinary grocery [[shopping cart]] into a high-performance [[electric vehicle]], and had been frequently seen riding around campus in his "LOLrioKart".&lt;ref name=GizmodoKart&gt;{{cite web|last=Frucci|first=Adam|title=MIT Students Build a Speedy Go-Kart Out of a Shopping Cart|url=https://gizmodo.com/5303616/mit-students-build-a-speedy-go+kart-out-of-a-shopping-cart|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shopping cart had a claimed top speed over {{convert|45|mph}}, and also had a complex steering wheel linkage and a low [[Steering|turning radius]] for maneuverability in tight spaces.  The student was a strong advocate of the [[open-source hardware|Open Source Hardware]] philosophy, and incorporated detailed documentation of his projects and a tutorial on building custom [[wheel hub motor]]s in his blog.&lt;ref name=GuanBlog&gt;{{cite web|last=Guan|first=Charles Z|title=[Homepage]|url=http://www.etotheipiplusone.net/|website=Equals zero|publisher=etotheipiplusone.net|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ersatz vehicle was prominently displayed at many MIT events, as well as at the [[Cambridge Science Festival]].  As a crowning mark of recognition by the outside world, the LOLrioKart driver once received a traffic ticket from the Cambridge Police, a copy of which was proudly displayed online.&lt;ref name=TrafficTicket&gt;{{cite web|last=Guan|first=Charles Z|title=I Love Cambridge|url=http://miters.mit.edu/2009/08/30/i-love-cambridge/|website=MITERS [Blog]|publisher=MIT Electronic Research Society (MITERS)|accessdate=2011-05-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225093506/http://miters.mit.edu/2009/08/30/i-love-cambridge/|archivedate=2011-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best large-scale hacks (e.g. the Caltech cannon heist) have involved multiple teams of hackers working on coordinated but diverse subtasks such as fund-raising, "[[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]]", [[Rigger (industry)|rigging]], [[logistics|transportation logistics]], [[electroplating|gold electroplating]], and precision [[numerical control|numerical controlled machining]], calling on a wide range of technical and management skills.&lt;ref name=CalCannon&gt;{{cite web|title=Caltech's Fleming Cannon transported to MIT|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2006/mitcannon/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not surprisingly, some hacker teams have gone on to found start-up business ventures, though they may be reluctant to reveal their earlier exploits until many years have passed.{{citation needed|date= April 2011}}

==Famous hacks==
One classic hack involved a police car with its flashing warning lights operating. The unusual aspect of this hack was its position — on top of MIT's Great Dome. The car was found to be a gutted, junked, heavy Chevrolet, painted meticulously to match the MIT Campus Police patrol cars. The car's number was [[pi]].  Its license plate read "[[#IHTFP|IHTFP]]", the abbreviation for MIT's unofficial slogan.  A dummy dressed as a campus patrolman was seated inside with mug of coffee and a box of donuts.&lt;ref name=CP-Car&gt;{{cite web|title=CP Car on the Great Dome|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1994/cp_car/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some years later, the police car has now been semi-permanently re-installed in the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]] as an all-time classic.&lt;ref name="StataHacks"/&gt;

Due to MIT's proximity to Harvard, many hacks involve the annual [[Harvard–Yale football rivalry|Harvard-Yale]] [[American football|football]] game.  Because of the Cambridge rivalry between MIT and Harvard, hackers often are found at the games, and they have come up with some of the most famous hacks in the Institute's history.&lt;ref name=HackHarvardWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Hacks on Harvard|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_topic/harvard.html|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HackHarvardBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

One such notable hack attempt targeting the 1948 Harvard-Yale football game&lt;ref name=HackHarvardBook1948&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork : a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|page=172|chapter=When MIT won the Harvard-Yale game: hacking Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved the use of [[detonating cord|primer cord]].  One night shortly before the game MIT students snuck into the Harvard stadium and buried primer cord just under the field.  The plan was to burn the letters MIT into the middle of the field during the game.  However, their work was uncovered by groundskeepers and disabled.  During the game the hackers were apprehended while wearing heavy coats on a fair-weather day.  The coats were lined with batteries, obviously intended to be used to detonate the primer cord.  An apocryphal story is that an MIT dean came to their defense, opening his own battery-lined coat and claiming that "all Tech men carry batteries"; an MIT dean did show up, but he was not wearing batteries.  This phrase has since become common among MIT students.

The Harvard-Yale football game was again the target of MIT hackers in 1982&lt;ref name=HackHarvardBook1982&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork : a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=172–176|chapter=When MIT won the Harvard-Yale game: hacking Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a large weather balloon painted with "MIT" all around was inflated, seemingly from nowhere, in the middle of the field.  The next day the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' ran the headline "MIT 1—Harvard-Yale 0: Tech Pranksters Steal the Show".  The 1982 Harvard-Yale hack earned acclaim as winner of "Hack Madness", a [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|March Madness]]-themed contest sponsored by the MIT Alumni Association in 2014 to determine "the greatest MIT hack of all time".&lt;ref name=HackMadness&gt;{{cite web|title=The Harvard-Yale Football Game is MIT Hack Madness Champion|url=https://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2014/03/14/hack-champion/|year=2014|publisher=Slice of MIT|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 an MIT banner was successfully launched from an end zone using a model rocket engine shortly before Yale attempted a field goal kick.&lt;ref name=HarvardYale1990&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard-Yale Game Banner|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1990/H-Y/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996, the Harvard logos on the scoreboard were hacked from ''VE-RI-TAS'' to read ''HU-GE-EGO'' instead.&lt;ref name=HY-Ego&gt;{{cite web|title="Huge Ego" at Harvard-Yale game|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2006/H_Y_huge_ego/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another traditional hacking target has been the bronze [[John Harvard (statue)|statue of John Harvard]],&lt;ref name=HackJohnHarvardBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork: a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=181–183|chapter=When MIT won the Harvard-Yale game: hacking Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt; the namesake of [[Harvard University]].  The statue itself was sculpted by [[Daniel Chester French]], a respected artist who studied at MIT, who is best known for his statue of ''[[Abraham Lincoln (1920 statue)|Abraham Lincoln]]'' at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in [[Washington DC]].  Because of its visible location in [[Harvard Yard]] and its symbolic significance, the John Harvard statue has been fitted with an unending sequence of "[[fashion accessory|accessories]]".  MIT hackers are hardly alone; [[Dartmouth College]] pranksters like to paint the statue green, [[Yale]] pranksters prefer blue, and others have dressed the statue in women's underwear.  MIT hackers like to go a few steps further,  fitting the statue with a plaster leg cast after a crushing football defeat,&lt;ref name=HarvardCast&gt;{{cite web|title=Cast on John Harvard|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1990/harvard_cast/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disguising the statue as the [[Unabomber]] after that infamous Harvard alumnus was arrested.&lt;ref name=UnabomberHack&gt;{{cite web|title=Unabomber Suspect Apprehended in Harvard Yard|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1996/unabomber/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Harvard has worn a [[Brass Rat]] from time to time, and has donned a Halo combat helmet and brandished a Halo assault rifle to mark the release of the ''Halo 3'' [[first-person shooter]] video game.&lt;ref name=HarvardHalo3&gt;{{cite web|title=John Harvard plays Halo3|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2007/halo3_john_harvard/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with hacker ethics, great care is taken to ensure that the hacks can be removed without causing permanent damage to Harvard's treasured symbol.&lt;ref name=HackJohnHarvardRingBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

The cleverness of many MIT hacks has even resulted in [[urban legend]]s about supposed hacks that may not have occurred.  One rumored hack involved a certain student's adherence to [[classical conditioning]] behavior response, as studied by Harvard Professor [[B. F. Skinner]]. Throughout the off-season, this supposed student visited the Harvard football stadium during his lunch break. He dressed in a black and white striped shirt and trousers, filled his pockets with bird-seed, then went on the field, blew a whistle, and spread his birdseed on the field. The result of all of this effort, the story goes, is that on opening day as the Harvard football team took the field to face their opponent, the referee blew his whistle to signal the start of the game, and the field was suddenly inundated by a flock of birds looking for their lunch.  Despite sounding like a classic MIT hack, this particular prank has never been verified.  The author of a 1990 book about pranks pulled by MIT students stated that he had not come across clear documentation of this tale during his years of research.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081216214708/http://www.snopes.com/college/pranks/birdseed.asp Seeded Field Prank]. snopes.com.

On the other hand, at least one hack involved a staged event that never occurred, when hackers convinced major news media that they had created an indoor snowstorm in Baker House dormitory.&lt;ref name=BakerSnow&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Baker House Snow Hack|url=http://museum.mit.edu/nom150/entries/1446|website=MIT 150 Exhibition Nominations|publisher=MIT Museum|accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, hackers installed 153 (= 9 x 17) custom-made wirelessly-controlled color-changing high-power [[LED]] lights into every window above the first floor of the 295-foot (90 m) tall MIT [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]]. They displayed a waving [[American flag]] throughout the evening of September 11, 2011 in remembrance of the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001.  For a short time in the early morning of September 12, the lights displayed a [[Tetris]] game, thus realizing a long-standing hack proposal, the "[[Holy Grail]]" of hacks. The display hardware had occasional glitches, and was removed as of September 13. The hardware and software designs were further developed and refined for better reliability. On April 20, 2012, MIT hackers successfully turned the Green Building into a huge playable Tetris game, operated from a wireless control podium at a comfortable viewing distance in front of the building. Visitors to Campus Preview Weekend (a gathering for admitted prospective freshman students) were invited to play the game on the colossal display grid (80&amp;nbsp;ft. wide x 250&amp;nbsp;ft. high), which was claimed to be the second-largest full-color video display in the US.&lt;ref name=Pourian&gt;{{cite news|last=Pourian|first=Jessica J.|title=The 'holy grail' of hacks: The construction of one of the most anticipated hacks of all time|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N22/tetris.html|accessdate=2012-05-06|newspaper=The Tech|date=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Brock|title=Hackers convert MIT building in giant Tetris video game|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/cambridge/2012/04/hackers_convert_mit_building_i.html|accessdate=2012-05-06|newspaper=Boston.com|date=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HackGalleryTetris&gt;{{cite web|title=Tetris on the Green Building|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2012/tetris/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|publisher=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of a one-shot temporary installation, the hackers have designed and built a permanent facility that can be re-used repeatedly by the MIT community. An understanding has been reached with the EAPS Department, which is headquartered in the Green Building, to allow the light display hardware to remain installed in each window.  To avoid annoying the occupants and to allow late-working staff to "opt out", each light display is equipped with a manual override button, which will disable the [[pixel]] lighting for that window for several hours after it is pressed. In addition, the hackers have released [[Open Source]] software tools used to develop new display patterns, so that others can design and deploy new stationary or animated images, in cooperation with the hacker engineers.&lt;ref name="Pourian"/&gt;

It originally stood for "I Hate This Fucking Place" but, due to use of profanity, is often [[euphemism|euphemized]] with other [[backronym]]s. Some of the more popular meanings include "I Have The Fucking Power" (Hacking), "I Help Tutor Freshman Physics", "It's Hard To Fondle Penguins", "I'm Hankering To Find Paradise", and "Interesting Hacks To Fascinate People", as well as "I Have Truly Found Paradise", "Institute for Hacks, TomFoolery, and Pranks" and "Institute Has The Finest Professors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mit.edu/people/mjbauer/ihtfp.html |title=IHTFP |website=Mit.edu |accessdate=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIT leadership has even adapted the acronym, using it to encourage vaccination during the 2009–2010 flu season with a banner in the MIT medical building that read "I Hate This Flu Pandemic". The precise time of origin is unknown, though the term IHTFP was already widely used at MIT by 1960.

==Caltech rivalry==
{{main|Caltech–MIT rivalry}}

MIT and [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] have been prank rivals since Spring 2005, when a group of Caltech students traveled to Cambridge to pull a string of pranks during "Campus Preview Weekend" (CPW) for prospective new MIT students.  The stunts included covering up the word "Massachusetts" in the "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" engraving on the main building façade with a banner, so that it read "That Other Institute of Technology". A group of MIT hackers quickly responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read "The Only Institute of Technology".&lt;ref name=HackCaltechBook&gt;

MIT students retaliated for CPW in April 2006, when students posing as the [http://www.howeandser.com/ "Howe &amp; Ser Moving Co."] abducted the 130-year-old, 1.7 ton Fleming House Cannon and moved it to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, thus reprising a similar prank performed by [[Harvey Mudd College]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=HackCaltechBook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/04/19/comedy_on_campus_mit_takes_on_caltech_for_prank_distinction/ |title=Comedy on Campus: MIT takes on Caltech for prank distinction |date=April 19, 2006 |publisher=Boston Globe |first=Catherine |last=Elton}}&lt;/ref&gt; To add a technical flourish, a [[Carat (purity)|24K]] gold-plated precisely upscaled machined replica of the famed [[Brass Rat]] (MIT's graduation ring) was tightly fitted over the barrel of the cannon, which was carefully aimed in the direction of Caltech.&lt;ref name="CalCannon"/&gt; Twenty-three members of Caltech Fleming House traveled to MIT to reclaim their cannon on April 10, 2006. They were greeted by a larger group of MIT students, who offered them a [[barbecue|BBQ]] farewell party.  In exchange, the Caltech students offered a small toy cannon, saying that this was "more your size".

During MIT's CPW in 2007, Caltech distributed a complete fake edition of ''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]'' (MIT's student newspaper) with the headline article reading "MIT Invents the Interweb".  Another article announced the discovery, "Infinite Corridor Not Actually Infinite", referring to MIT's [[Infinite Corridor|iconic main thoroughfare]].  The edition included a mock weather forecast, referring often to how sunny [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] (where Caltech is located) is compared to [[Boston]], as well as other satirical articles.&lt;ref name="HackCaltechBook"/&gt;

In 2008, Caltech students provided a "Puzzle Zero" in the [[MIT Mystery Hunt]] which when solved, told solvers to "CALL 1-626-848-3780 ASAP". When MIT students dialed the number, they heard, "Thank you for calling the Caltech Admissions Office. If you are another MIT student wishing to transfer to Caltech, please download our transfer application form from www.caltech.edu. If you are an MIT student not wishing to transfer to Caltech, we wish you the best of luck, and hope you find happiness someday...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Harvey |title=Rub a dub dub, a suspect in a tub; Battle of the brains |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/columnists/la-me-only8-2008jun08,0,6914716.column |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=2008-06-08 |accessdate=2008-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around Thanksgiving weekend in 2009, yet another fake edition of ''The Tech'' was released, alleging that MIT had been sold to Caltech and would become "Caltech East: School of Humanities". Students would be required to take a core of literature, history, philosophy, and economics, but science subjects would be eliminated.&lt;ref name="HackCaltechBook"/&gt;

In the past few years, MIT hackers have tended to ignore Caltech "nuisance" pranks, instead preferring to perform more imaginatively engineered hacks on their own home campus.   In particular, the majority of documented hacks occurring during CPW have been perpetrated by MIT students themselves.&lt;ref name=CreativePeople&gt;{{cite web|title="Creative People with Words" items appear around campus|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2009/creative_people_with_words/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Annual&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Event Hacks [CPW]|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_topic/timing-dependent.html|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
MIT hackers have only rarely interfered with Caltech traditions, rituals, or celebrations.  But some MIT hackers do occasionally engage in low-level "sniping" back and forth with Caltech pranksters.  For example, hackers made a website http://www.mitrejects.com redirect to Caltech's homepage.  Caltech then did the same, with https://web.archive.org/web/20110614193503/http://www.caltechrejects.com/ redirecting to the MIT homepage.

A possible change in attitude started when a [[TARDIS]], which hackers had placed on the MIT Little Dome (August 25, 2010) and the MIT Great Dome (August 30, 2010), was transported to the roof of Baxter Hall at Caltech (January 4, 2011) by MIT and Caltech pranksters, where it remained for several weeks.  The traveling time-machine subsequently reappeared atop Birge Hall at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (January 29, 2011), and then rematerialized on the Durand Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering Building at [[Stanford University]] (March 18, 2011).  The TARDIS came complete with a helpful note explaining how to disassemble it, and suggesting passing it on to other unexplored destinations.&lt;ref name=MIT-TARDIS&gt;

==Chronology of selected recent hacks==
The MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery website&lt;ref name=IHTFP-Gallery&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the IHTFP Gallery!|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has an extensive but far from complete catalog of past hacks related to MIT, including numerous documentary photos.  More-complete coverage, especially of older hacks, appears in the books listed under [[#Further reading|Further Reading]] below, but these printed volumes appear only intermittently. The listing here only summarizes a few salient examples from MIT's long tradition of hacking.

===2017===

In the early morning of April 26, 2017, recent graduate Nicholas William Paggi died while hacking the Great Dome.  According to the MIT newspaper, The Tech, the brilliant computer scientist slipped and fell to his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thetech.com/2017/04/27/nicholas-paggi |title=MIT graduate and 'brilliant programmer' dies on campus |accessdate=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013===
On the evening of January 10, 2013, [[Pac-Man]] and Blinky appeared on the scaffolding covering the Great Dome during reconstruction. According to the MIT alumni blog ''Slice of MIT'', the Pac-Man vs. Blinky battle was intended to serve as a metaphor for the semester. "Pac-Man represents the unquenchable search for knowledge, while Blinky represents the unforeseen distractions that may occur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Lauren | last = Landry | title = New Year, New Hack: MIT Students Place Pac-Man On Top of the Great Dome | date = January 11, 2013 | publisher = Streetwise Media | url = http://bostinno.com/2013/01/11/mit-pac-man-hack-to-the-great-dome-photos/#ss__283060_236262_0__ss | work = [[BostInno]] | accessdate = 2013-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Lauren | last = Dezenski | title = In whimsical retro tribute, Pac-Man appears on MIT's Great Dome | date = January 11, 2013 | publisher = NY Times Co | url = http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/01/11/mrs-pac-man-appears-mit-great-dome/T7qxv9hmVtJb6hJEauu7ZJ/story.html | work = [[Boston.com]] | accessdate = 2013-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous hacks===
;April 1, 1998: As an [[April Fools' Day|April Fool's Day]] prank, the MIT home page was replaced with a page announcing the university had been bought by [[The Walt Disney Company]] for [[United States dollar|$]]6.9 billion. The hacked page showed a picture of [[Mickey Mouse]] ears atop the Great Dome, and replaced the letter I in MIT with the lower-case "i" from Disney's [[wordmark]]. It even contained a fake press release with statements purportedly from Disney and MIT officials, detailing terms of the acquisition.&lt;ref name=MITDisney&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Disney buying MIT or was the MIT home page hacked?|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1998/disney_buys_mit/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;May 9, 1994: A carefully assembled outer frame of a car painted as an MIT Campus Police car appeared on top of the Great Dome. This hack quickly gained recognition on many local news sources and on national television.&lt;ref name="CP-Car"/&gt;
;December 9, 1991: It has been often said that "Getting an Education from MIT is like taking a drink from a Fire Hose", inspiring hackers to connect a real fire hose and a concrete-embedded [[fire hydrant]] to a drinking fountain in Building 16. Years later, the iconic monument has been semi-permanently re-installed by the MIT Museum in the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]].&lt;ref name=FireHoseHack&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Hose Drinking Fountain

;October 31, 1979: A lifesize fiberglass cow appeared on top of the Great Dome. The cow was later installed by the MIT Museum in the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]].
;November 1963: The first ever reference to malicious [[security hacker|hacking]] is '[[phreaking|telephone hackers]]' in MIT's student newspaper, ''The Tech'' of hackers trying up the lines with [[Harvard University|Harvard]], configuring the [[PDP-1]] to make free calls, [[war dialing]] and accumulating large phone bills.&lt;ref&gt;https://infostory.com/2011/11/20/hacking-and-blue-boxes/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/first-recorded-usage-of-hacker/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tech.mit.edu/V83/PDF/V83-N24.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
;October 1958: [[Oliver R. Smoot]], a pledge of MIT's [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity in 1958, was used to measure the length of the [[Harvard Bridge]]. As he lay on the sidewalk of the bridge that carries Massachusetts Avenue across the [[Charles River]], markings were made at intervals corresponding to his height. The bridge was measured to be 364.4 [[Smoot]]s (plus or minus one ear) in length.  During renovation of the bridge in 1964 the markings were carefully restored, and the markings remain to this day.

The '''Hargeysa International Book Fair''' ('''HIBF''') ({{lang-so|Bandhigga Caalamiga ah ee Buugaagta Hargeysa}}) is an annual cultural event in the northwestern [[Somaliland]] region of [[Somalia]]. It is one of the largest public [[book fair]]s in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Every summer, HIBF brings writers, poets, artists and thinkers from Somaliland and from all over the world gather to share and discuss their art and literary productions with a wider audience. The main goal of the festival is to promote a culture of reading and writing in the region by producing and publishing high quality [[Somali literature]] and translating international classical literature (including fiction, poetry and drama) into Somali. Organized by the Redsea Online Culture Foundation, the event aims to enable young people to access a range of cultural heritages, with the intention of stimulating the revival of all forms of art and human expression, including painting, poetry reciting, story-telling, drama composition and writing.

==History==
===Origins===
The Hargeysa International Book Fair was inaugurated in 2008 by [[Jama Musse Jama]], who serves as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcement: 2010 Hargeysa International Book Fair (HIBF) 23rd of July to the 27th of July 2010 in Hargeysa|url=http://www.baadiya.com/View.aspx?ID=403|publisher=Baadiya|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grew from 200 to 10,000 participants over the following six years.

===Significance===
HIBF targets not only a young audience, but wider sectors of society. It aims to help foster cultural understanding, tolerance, democracy, and an appreciation of the diversity of Somali culture and literature. In the past few years, the Redsea Online Culture Foundation's festivals have served to raise the profile of reading and writing in the Somaliland region, and also unite youth from different provinces in the area. The main goal of the book fair is to promote critically thinking cultural and creative writing, to facilitate the habit of reading, to display books, from both local and writers abroad, to encourage members in the public to browse, read, engage with authors, serve as an inspiration to young people, and the wider society.

===Parallel events and joint ventures===
''Somaliland Moving Library'': The Moving Library Tour is the Book Fair's flagship outreach event. An exciting initiative, it takes place a week before the opening of the festival in Hargeisa and is held across all regions of Somaliland. It aims to bring the ethos and principles of the Book Fair – of citizenship and creative freedoms – closer to aspiring writers and readers outside of the city.

'''''Higher Learning''''' is a 1995 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[John Singleton]] and starring an [[ensemble cast]]. The film follows the changing lives of three incoming freshmen at the fictional Columbus University: Malik Williams ([[Omar Epps]]), a black track star who struggles with academics; Kristen Connor ([[Kristy Swanson]]), a shy and naive girl; and Remy ([[Michael Rapaport]]), a lonely and confused man seemingly out of place in his new environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Violence Erupts in Opening Week of 'Higher Learning' |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 20, 1995 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-20/entertainment/ca-22364_1_higher-learning |accessdate=2012-06-03 |first=Richard |last=Natale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also featured [[Tyra Banks]]' first performance in a theatrical film. [[Laurence Fishburne]] won an [[NAACP Image Award]] for "Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture"; [[Ice Cube]] was also nominated for the award. This was the last film appearance of [[Dedrick D. Gobert]], who was shot dead in 1994 prior to the film's release.

The exterior shots and outdoor scenes were shot on the campus of [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) while the interiors were shot at [[Sony Pictures Studios]].

==Plot==&lt;!--- Jan 2016: still a little long, at 831 words (vs 2131 words in Dec 2015), but then there are 3 converging storylines  ---&gt;  
At fictitious Columbus University, students Malik Williams, a black track athlete, Kristen Connor, a white woman, and Remy, a white young man, are starting their freshman year.

Kristen's roommate is Monet, a black student. Malik's roommate is Wayne, a white student. Both sets of roommates generally get along.  Monet and Malik attend a [[Dormitory|dorm]] party hosted by Fudge, an [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and militant senior. Remy, Fudge's roommate, is upset at the loud [[Hip hop music|rap music]] being played so late. He flags down an all-white campus security patrol to break up the party. Fudge is upset that lead Officer Bradley comes down hard on the black students, but allows the room down the hall to continue their loud "[[hillbilly]]" music. Kristen, while walking home, meets Taryn, a junior as well as an openly [[lesbian]] student. Taryn warns her about walking alone late at night and invites her to a student group.

Malik and Kristen's introductory [[political science]] class is taught by Professor Maurice Phipps, a conservative black man from the [[West Indies]]. Professor Phipps challenges the class to determine who they are for themselves and not let others categorize them.

Fudge and his friend Dreads play loud music, disrupting Remy's studying. When Remy complains, Fudge mocks and threatens him, causing Remy to move in with a new roommate, Jewish student David. Later, Remy loses at a video game to Malik, who further mocks him.

Frat boy Billy rapes a drunken Kristen. Monet finds Kristen crying on her bed, then fields a racially charged call from Billy. Angered, Monet turns to Fudge, who recruits his friends to confront him at a frat party. Kristen points out Billy to the black students, who pull him outside and force him to apologize to Monet (not knowing that he raped Kristen).

Kristen joins Taryn's student group on harmony between different races and cliques. With time, she eventually opens up to Taryn about her rape, with Taryn encouraging her to report it and attempting to console her. As days pass, Kristen slowly realizes her growing attraction to Taryn.

Remy has become more isolated.  He is invited for a drink by Scott Moss, a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] and [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[skinhead]], along with Scott's skinhead friends: Erik, James, and the weight-lifting, hulking Knocko.

Malik confronts Phipps about a paper, arguing for a better grade. When Phipps shows him the various spelling and grammar errors, Malik calls him a sellout for the "white establishment". Phipps angrily responds that the world owes Malik nothing and he must work for his own good to make a difference in the world. When Malik's teammates confront him for a poor performance at a track meet, he responds with Fudge's militant Afrocentric ideology. He walks away and flirts with fellow runner Deja. With time they become a couple, and Deja helps Malik with his essay and spelling errors.

Remy spends more time with Scott and his gang. Scott preaches his racist beliefs, and the troubled Remy is slowly being convinced that "the white man is endangered", agreeing to shave his head and join Scott's group.

After attending a rape awareness rally with Taryn, Kristen asks to spend the night. Taryn rebuffs her, wanting Kristen to be sure. Kristen eventually starts separate relationships with Wayne and Taryn, who are unaware that Kristen is sleeping with both of them.

Remy confronts Malik with racial slurs. Remy later pulls a handgun on Malik and David, hurling racial slurs at them both as he packs his belongings and drops out of the university. Again, Officer Bradley and the all-white campus security assume Malik is at fault, letting Remy escape. Malik decides to move in with Fudge and his like-minded black friends, while Remy moves in with Scott and the neo-Nazi skinheads.  After Malik and his black friends win a fistfight against Remy and his skinhead friends, Scott first tells Remy he should not drop out of school because they do not just need soldiers, but also educated people like lawyers to fight for their cause. However Remy, feeling punked by Malik, just wants to turn to violence. So after Remy insists that he is "for real", Scott sighs and shows Remy the sniper rifle. He challenges Remy to kill for the [[White people|white race]].

Kristen organizes a peace festival with Monet to calm down the students. Malik and Deja attend, and are caught in the frenzy when Remy opens fire from the rooftop of a nearby building. Two students are killed, including Deja, who dies in Malik's arms. Malik runs into the building and attacks Remy, trying to choke him to death when Officer Bradley and his campus guards intervene and beat Malik while letting Remy go. The campus guards finally approach Remy, who looks and apologizes to Malik for everything that he did and commits suicide.

A few days later, Malik and Phipps discuss his future at the university, with Phipps saying he trusts Malik's judgment. Later, Malik and Kristen are seen talking, for the first time, at an impromptu memorial site. Kristen feels guilty about the deaths because she started the Peace Fest, but Malik assuages her guilt.

As Phipps leaves his office, the final shot shows the United States flag fluttering in the wind as the caption "unlearn" appears over it, fading to the closing credits.

{{Anchor|Awards}}
Under the category of Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for the 1996 [[Image Award]], [[Ice Cube]] was nominated for his role in Higher Learning. The award was won by fellow cast member [[Laurence Fishburne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Image Awards (1996)|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000345/1996|website=IMDb|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response {{anchor|Film Reviews|Critics}} ===
The film received mixed reviews. [[Roger Ebert]] commended John Singleton's direction of the film: "He sees with a clear eye and a strong will, and is not persuaded by fashionable ideologies. His movies are thought-provoking because he uses familiar kinds of characters and then asks hard questions about them." He awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=January 11, 1995 |authorlink=Roger Ebert |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=Higher Learning |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950111/REVIEWS/501110301/1023 |via=RogerEbert.com |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time Out (company)|TimeOut Magazine]]'' wrote: "a stylish, intelligent film-maker, Singleton interweaves the threads of his demographic tapestry with assurance, passion and a welcome awareness of the complexities of the college community's contradictory impulses towards integration and separatism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/72021/higher_learning.html |title=Higher Learning Review |magazine=[[Time Out (company)|TimeOut Magazine]] |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt; |accessdate=2015-01-27 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;

''Reel Film Reviews'' wrote that the film is "consistently entertaining and well-acted all around. While it's not a perfect movie – Cube's character disappears for a 30-minute stretch and Singleton's approach often veers into heavy-handedness – it is nevertheless an intriguing look at the differences between races and how such differences can clash" and awarded it 3.5 stars out of 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Scroll.jpg|200px|thumb|Scroll of the [[Book of Esther]], [[Seville]], [[Spain]]]]
A '''[[scroll]]''' (from the Old French ''escroe'' or ''escroue''), is a roll of [[papyrus]], [[parchment]], or [[paper]] containing writing.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Peter. (2008) "scroll" in ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000'' Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2008. http://www.oxfordreference.com Retrieved 21 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The '''history of scrolls''' dates back to ancient Egypt.  In most ancient literate cultures scrolls were the earliest format for longer documents written in ink or paint on a flexible background, preceding bound [[book]]s; rigid media such as [[clay tablet]]s were also used but had many disadvantages in comparison. For most purposes scrolls have long been superseded by the [[codex]] book format, but they are still produced for some ceremonial or religious purposes, notably for the Jewish [[Torah scroll]] for use in [[synagogue]]s.

==Origins in Africa==

Scrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean [[ancient Egyptian civilization]]s.

Parchment scrolls were used by several early civilizations before the [[codex]] or bound [[book]] with pages and was invented by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the 1st century AD{{fact|date=April 2018}}.  Nevertheless, scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into Roman times where they were usually written in single latitudinal column.

==Eastern Mediterranean, West Asia and Europe==

===Israel===

The Hebrew tradition assumes that the [[Torah]] was copied by [[Moses]] onto a scroll (in about 1200 BCE) made from skin of a [[kosher]] animal, rather than [[papyrus]] as in Dynastic Egypt. Since there is no historical evidence for Moses and the events related in the Torah, there is no reliable way to know the time when Hebrews started using scrolls for their religious books.&lt;ref name="autogenerated99"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dever, William G. | title=What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It? | publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-8028-2126-3}}p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Jewish tradition, since that time scrolls, which are very durable with examples known to be hundreds of years old such as the 800-year-old Sephardic [[Sefer Torah]] from Spain, are copied from one to another.

The meticulous process of hand-copying a scroll takes about 2,000 person-hours (about one year at 40 hours per week). 

The Torah scroll contains 304,805 letters (or approximately 79,000 words). &lt;br /&gt;
Other books of the [[Tanakh]] are also written in scroll form, as well as the small [[mezuzah]] scrolls found in the door frames of most orthodox, conservative and reform Jewish households. Some Jewish families own their own [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] scroll for use during [[Purim]].

There is a difference between the [[Qere and Ketiv|כְּתִיב (''Ketiv'')]], what is and must be written (in consonantal text, with vowels omitted), and the קְרֵי (''Qere''), what is read.

===Syria and Babylon===

The Jewish communities in these countries used the same techniques to manufacture scrolls, but using deer skins. The scrolls from these areas were known for their quality and durability, and were later imported into European and Indian communities.

Non-Jewish vellum manufacturing also took place after the 3rd century BC.

===Greece and Rome===
{{double image|right|Giovane con rotolo.JPG|150|MANNapoli 120620 a Fresco young man with rolls from Pompeii Italy.jpg|150|[[Roman portraiture]] [[fresco]]s from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD, depicting two different men wearing [[laurel wreath]]s, one holding the ''[[rotulus]]'', the other a ''volumen''}}
[[File:Busto maschile.JPG|thumb|[[Roman portraiture]] fresco of a young man with a [[papyrus]] [[scroll]], from [[Herculaneum]], 1st century AD]]
Scrolls were used by the ancient Greeks. In Roman usage the scrolls were written latitudinally, usually placed on podiums with roll holders from which the rolls were unwound.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Romans eventually found the scroll too cumbersome for lengthy works and developed the [[codex]], which is the formal name for the modern style of book, with individual pages bound together.

===Early Christian era===

Scrolls continued to be used at times during the Early Church era until the [[Early Middle Ages]], but Christianity was an early adopter of the codex.  It is often thought that this reflects the background in trade of many early Christians, who were used to codex notebooks, and less attached to the form that was traditional among the Roman elite and religious Jews.

===European Middle Ages===

Scrolls virtually ceased to be used for books and documents in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], and were reintroduced for rare use in official treaties and other international documents of great significance during and after the Baroque Era of the 0th century. These were usually written on high quality vellum, and stored in elaborate silver and gold cases inscribed with names of participants. Earlier examples were written in Latin.  Scrolls continued in use for administrative and accounting purposes all over Europe. In English they were often referred to as "rolls", hence the [[Pipe rolls|Great Rolls]] of the English [[Exchequer]], and titles such as [[Master of the Rolls]] (a senior judge), still used in the 21st century.  The official copy of English, now British, legislation was still printed on vellum in a roll format and stored in the [[Palace of Westminster]] until 2017, when the use of Vellum was replaced with archival paper&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/21/anger-mps-bow-peers-pressure-end-500-year-old-tradition-printing/&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Exultet Scroll]] from Southern Italy and Byzantine [[Joshua Scroll]] were prestige objects that used the old form in a revivalist spirit.

===West and Central Asia===

Scrolls continued in use longer in the Islamic world, often elaborately decorated in calligraphic writing that included use of gold embossing and pigments when used for the writing of the Qur'an.

===East Asia===
{{see also|Hanging scroll|Handscroll}}

Scrolls continued in use longer in East Asian cultures like China, Korea and Japan.

The Chinese invented and perfected 'Indian Ink' for use in writing, including scrolls. Originally designed for blacking the surfaces of raised stone-carved hieroglyphics, the ink was a mixture of soot from pine smoke and lamp oil mixed with the gelatin of donkey skin and musk. The ink invented by the Chinese philosopher, Tien-Lcheu (2697 B.C.){{fact|date=April 2018}}, became common by the year 1200 B.C.

Later other formats came into use in China, firstly the ''sutra'' or ''scripture'' binding, a scroll folded [[concertina]]-style, which avoids the need to unroll to find a passage in the middle.  By about 1,000 CE, sheet-based formats were introduced, although scrolls continued to have a place. Traditional [[painting]] and [[calligraphy]] in East Asia is often still performed on relatively short latitudinal paper scrolls displayed vertically as a [[hanging scroll]] on a wall or horizontally and flat as a [[handscroll]].

==Replacement by the ''Codex''==
The [[codex]] was a new format for reading the written word, consisting of individual pages loosely attached to each other at one side and bound with boards or cloth. It came to replace the scroll thanks to several problems that limited the scroll's function and readability. For one, scrolls were very long, sometimes as long as ten meters. This made them hard to hold open and read, a difficulty not helped by the fact that most scrolls in that era were read horizontally, instead of vertically as scrolling virtual documents are read now. The text on a scroll was continuous, without page breaks, which made indexing and bookmarking impossible. Conversely, the codex was easier to hold open, separate pages made it possible to index sections and mark a page, and the protective covers kept the fragile pages intact better than scrolls generally stayed. This last made it particularly attractive for important religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2011) ''Books: A Living History.'' Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. p. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect that made the codex more attractive than the scroll was ease of copying. It was possible to hold open a codex with one hand and write notes- or copy the text- with the other. For early Christendom this was an invaluable asset, as the ability to mass reproduce their gospels was in high demand. Early Medieval Christians were some of the first to adopt the codex over the scroll.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Gary, [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v17/bp17-10.html "Adoption of the Codex Book: Parable of a New Reading Mode"], ''The Book and Paper Group Annual'', Retrieved 12/1/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The codex began to replace the scroll almost as soon as it was invented. For example, in Egypt by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered the scroll or roll by ten to one based on surviving examples, and by the sixth century the scroll had almost vanished from use as a vehicle for literature.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Colin H., and Skeat, T.C. (1987), ''The Birth of the Codex''. London: [[Oxford University Press]] for the [[British Academy]], p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other places the scroll lingered. As mentioned above, English monarchs used so called “statute rolls” to record important legislation until well into the Middle Ages. Scrolls were also commonly used in theater productions, a practice from which the term “actor’s roll” was coined.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2011) ''Books: A Living History.'' Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
[[File:Hanging scroll 7a33a8.jpg|thumb|[[Hanging scroll]]s of [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] on display, [[Shanghai]]]]
Torah Scrolls are still used today in Jewish religious observance with almost insignificant changes despite the thousands of years in practice.

Some cultures use scrolls as ceremonial texts or for decoration—such as a [[hanging scroll]]—without any obvious division of the text into columns. In some scroll-using cultures painted illustrations were used as header decorations above the text columns, either in a continuous band or broken into scenes above either a single or double column of text.

One of the few modern texts the original of which was written on what is effectively a scroll is the manuscript of [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]'', typed onto what he called "the scroll", made of taped-together sheets of paper.

The verb "[[Scrolling|to scroll]]" is much used in the age of [[Display device|screen]] displays—[[computer]] displays, rolling [[Closing credits|credits]] in [[film]]s and so on—with the screen filled with text moving (scrolling) up or down or sideways, appearing at one edge of the display and disappearing at the other as if being unrolled from one side of a scroll and rolled up at the other.

"'''Joy to the World'''" is a song written by [[Hoyt Axton]] and made famous by the band [[Three Dog Night]]. The song is also popularly known by its opening lyric, "'''Jeremiah was a bullfrog.'''" Three Dog Night originally released the song on their fourth [[studio album]], ''[[Naturally (Three Dog Night album)|Naturally]]'', in November 1970, and subsequently released an edited version of the song as a [[Single (music)|single]] in February 1971.&lt;ref name="notes1" /&gt;

The song, which has been described by members of Three Dog Night as a "kid's song" and a "silly song,"&lt;ref name="notes2"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Celebrate: The Three Dog Night Story, 1965–1975 |others=Three Dog Night |year=1993 |first=David |last=Leaf |authorlink=David Leaf |pages=20 |type=CD liner |publisher=MCA Records |id=MCAD2-10956 |location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; topped the singles charts in North America, was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], and has since been [[Cover version|covered]] by multiple artists.

The song is featured prominently in the film ''[[The Big Chill (film)|The Big Chill]]''. It is sung by a child character at the beginning and the Three Dog Night recording is played over the end credits.

It is also played at the end of every [[Denver Broncos]] home victory. Notable playings of this song after Broncos victories included then-[[Chicago Bears]] head coach [[Abe Gibron]]'s singing along with the song in 1973; and at the end of [[Super Bowl XXXII]], played at [[Qualcomm Stadium]] in [[San Diego]]. It was also played at the end of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] at Pro Player (now [[Hard Rock Stadium|Hard Rock) Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]] and [[Super Bowl 50]] in [[Santa Clara, California]].

== Background and recording ==
Some of the words are nonsensical. Axton wanted to persuade his record producers to record a new melody he had written and the producers asked him to sing any words to the tune. A member of Three Dog Night said that the original lyrics to the song were "Jeremiah was a prophet" but no one liked it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 20, 2008 |title=Three Dog Night Headlines the Fair Tonight |journal=[[The Review (Bainbridge Island)|Bainbridge Island Review]] |at=Entertainment section |issn=1053-2889 |accessdate=April 5, 2011 |url=http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/kitsap/bir/entertainment/27111724.html?period=W&amp;mpStartDate=05-15-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hoyt Axton performed the song to the group, two of the three main vocalists – [[Danny Hutton]] and [[Cory Wells]] – rejected the song, but [[Chuck Negron]] felt that the band needed a "silly song" to help bring the band back together as a working unit. Negron also felt that the song "wasn't even close to our best record, but it might have been one of our most honest."&lt;ref name="notes2" /&gt;

The song was recorded by Three Dog Night at American Recording Company, produced by [[Richard Podolor]], and engineered by Bill Cooper.&lt;ref name="notes1" /&gt; Unlike most Three Dog Night songs recorded at that point, instead of having just the three main vocalists singing harmony, the song was recorded with all seven members of the band singing.&lt;ref name="notes2" /&gt; Drummer Floyd Sneed sings the deep lyric "I wanna tell you" towards the end of the song.

When the song hit #1 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1971, Axton and his mother, [[Mae Axton]], became the first mother and son to each have written a number one pop single in the rock era. Mae Axton co-wrote "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", which was the first number one hit for [[Elvis Presley]].

In a 1994 case, David P. Jackson filed suit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/25/884/572096/|title=Jackson v. Axton|website=Law.justia.com|accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming co-authorship of the song and alleging that Axton fraudulently claimed sole authorship. In the suit, Jackson claimed that Axton regularly credited him with co-authorship.

A '''limner''' is an [[illuminated manuscript|illuminator of manuscripts]], or more generally, a painter of ornamental decoration. One of the earliest mentions of a limner's work is found in the book ''Methods and Materials of Painting'' by [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] (1793–1865).

{{quote|"The treatises [on oil painting] cannot be placed later than the thirteenth, or beginning of the fourteenth, century. This was the age of [[Dante]], and "the art which in Paris was called illuminating" (limning) is well illustrated by such guides." p.&amp;nbsp;45&lt;ref&gt;Eastlake. ''Methods and Materials of Painting''. Mineola, NY: [[Dover Publications]], 2001. {{ISBN|978-0486417264}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==United Kingdom==
In London in the mid-19th century the limner [[David Laurent de Lara]] established himself as a modern illuminator of manuscripts and documents.&lt;ref name=pal&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rubinstein |editor1-first=William L.|editor2-last=Jolles|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Rubinstein |editor3-first=Hilary |title=The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History |isbn=9780230318946 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spOxzrifZjcC&amp;pg=PA551&amp;lpg=PA551#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Laurent de Lara, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work broke new ground and helped establish the idea of illumination as a contemporary artform in its own right, rather than as a historical artform.&lt;ref name=rowan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Rowan|editor1-last=Coomans D|editor1-first=Thomas|editor2-last=De Maeyer|editor2-first=Jan|title=The revival of medieval illumination : nineteenth-century Belgium manuscripts and illuminations from a european perspective = Renaissance de l'enluminure médiévale : manuscripts et enluminures belges du XIXe siècle et leur contexte européen |date=2007 |publisher=KADOC |location=Leuven |isbn=9789058675910 |pages=88–92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VsLdTWjlnoC&amp;pg=PA88|chapter=Publishing for the Leisure Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of Her Majesty's [[Painter and Limner]] is a position within the [[Great Officer of State|Royal Household]] unique to Scotland. It is currently held by Dame Elizabeth Blackadder.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Birthdays Today 24 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The position of portrait painter to the royal household is honorary and for life.

==United States==
In early 19th-century America, a limner artist was one who had little if any formal training and would travel from place to place to solicit commissions.

Among colonial America's rising mercantile class, a limner was an unattributed [[portrait]] commissioned as a status symbol. The local landowners and merchants who commissioned these portraits posed in their finest clothes, in well-appointed interiors, or in landscapes that identified their position, property, good taste, and sophistication.

A late named artist who began in this genre is the [[Maine]] landscape artist [[Charles Codman]], who in Eastern Argus (April 1, 1831) is described as an "ornamental and sign painter" or "limner" who practiced "Military, Standard, Fancy, Ornamental, Masonic and Sign Painting".&lt;ref&gt;Nicoll, Jessica.

==Playing contexts==
Chinese instruments are either played solo, collectively in large orchestras (as in the former imperial court) or in smaller ensembles (in teahouses or public gatherings). Normally, there is no conductor in traditional Chinese music, nor any use of musical scores or tablature in performance. Music was generally learned aurally and memorized by the musician(s) beforehand, then played without aid. As of the 20th century, musical scores have become more common, as has the use of conductors in larger orchestral-type ensembles.

==Musical instruments in use in the 1800s==
These watercolour illustrations, made in China in the 1800s, show several types of musical instruments being played:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11003">'''Lux Aeterna Theater''' is a blend of art and entertainment with a unique self-created method. It is a theater of laser and sound, which presents new synthetic art forms for almost 40 years.  Although the equipment Lux Aeterna Theater uses is meant for holographic ads, laser support of pop concerts and a variety of other shows, according to the founders of this method, their technique provides the ability to visualize the tone, harmony, tonality and nature of music, allowing to illustrate, emphasize and deepen the thematic development, and thus the whole dramaturgy of the performance.

==Method==

Lux Aeterna Theater has no stationary location and operates internationally; it can be easily assembled on various sites. The premises must include a projection surface (planetarium, dome hemisphere, panoramic projection screen, etc.), seats, and an optical pad behind the seats, projectors, and remote control. The optical pad is a metal plate with drilled holes in the grid and with threaded openings. The drives are positioning the optical elements into the beam or slow-acting control beam with a set of lines. Each line of the laser creates a separate image. The method, resulting in interference patterns on flat surfaces, is based on the use of accidental phase modulation, which occurs when a laser beam passing through optically heterogeneous mediums is refracted at different points and angles along its way, resulting in interference patterns projected on a screen that change in contour and texture with each change in medium. The medium is made of solid transparent matter (e.g. moving plates of non-uniform structure -usually round discs mounted in a revolving cassette. And as a result, a wide selection of visual character, image, shapes, effect appears on a screen. Or/and an additional lens is used to concentrate the light field. Or/and transfocators are mounted at the beam's point of exit. These form-building methods can be used in the same cassettes (to increase image possibilities) with diffraction gratings, curvilinear reflectors or a large moving lens (for the deformation of light imago). Lighting plot involves complex abstract light ductile movements. The projection tool allows receiving on-screen a very complex dynamics of light colorful shapes, to create a light accompaniment by colorful, graphic, structural visualization of thematic development, to unite music, musical sounds, and musical noises with light content. It also allows the spatial separation and motion of different audio content, voices, melody and musical instruments.

==History==

Theater was founded in 1982 by Daniel Fridman, a professional theater lighting director and sound engineer, in [[Uzhhorod]], Transcarpathia, former USSR and now territory of Ukraine. Under the roof of the local House of Culture, Lux Aeterna became an independent half state funded legal entity with Daniel Fridman as its first artistic director. The theater team consisted of Victor Schurov, chief designer and engineer, Vasiliy Makara, engineer, Ferenc Pejchy, lighting designer, Pavel Gladovskiy, engineer, Ihor Skalskiy, laser designer and engineer. The theater hall was divided into two parts. In one part there was a spectator room for 70 seats. In another - the so-called "light mine". The light mine is known to have a special space, the walls, the ceiling and the floor of which are painted to matte black color, so that there is not the slightest reflection of light as well as a set of light projection equipment. Various light, light-projecting devices, mirror surfaces of small and large formats, reflective films, a large set of glass and film color filters, transparent cuvettes with water, helium-neon and helium-cadmium lasers, an optical pad saturated with various optical elements and lenses of large sizes. With the help of these technical means, the theater's artists were able to create complex dynamic light images, shapes, characters on a special homemade projection screen made of film-tracing paper. 

According to Daniel Fridman, the founder of the theater, the works of the Russian composer [[Alexander Scriabin]], the art of [[Kazimir Malevich]], the poetry of the early twentieth century poets were his sources of inspiration. {{Quote|We can consider [[Alexander Scriabin]] to be our predecessor — he experimented with combining music and light effects. Today the state of technology is such that it gives us almost unlimited possibilities for creating and developing the art of light and sound.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20062/126&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

In the summer of 1985 Lux Aeterna Theater projected the rays of the most powerful at that time stage lasers (2,5 W krypton and 6,5 W argon) on the night clouds over the Moscow Dynamo stadium at the [[12th World Festival of Youth and Students]]. This equipment had a couple of hundred kilograms of weight, a water cooling system with a bunch of inconveniences in tens of meters of hoses for supply and discharge of water.  From 1987 The Light and Sound Theater operated in the Transcarpathian Regional Music and Drama Theater. 

In 2003 the Lux Aeterna came to [[Kiev]] with a new concept to create a stationary light and sound theater under the cupola of the [[Kiev Planetarium]]. In [[Kiev]] Aleksandr Kasian, student physicist, and musician Yevhen Khalaf, joined their theater group. During 2003 to 2007 they premiered three acclaimed performances - Gravitation: Zero, Exhilaration of the Milky Ways and Night of the Longest Kiss. More than 600 séances were held during that period and the theater became one of the most visited sights in the city. Furthermore, Lux Aeterna introduced scent design to their performances, adding aromas and experimenting with affecting one more of the human senses - the sense of smell. In the beginning of June 2007 collaboration between Lux Aeterna and Theater of Voice (Duo Zikr band) called The Sound of Magic premiered at the [[Kiev Planetarium]]. Its creator’s united visual effects with wide range of live vocal techniques, like throat singing, in a show. 

==Present==

In late spring 2017 Lux Aeterna takes part in the Tessart project, a center of art and immersive technologies in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], Russia. The theater group, joined by Nikolay Matveev, an associate professor of light design, creates a space called LuxAeterna 360°+ for the project. It is a mobile dome for 15 spectators, built for a real-time deep relaxation and visual art experience.&lt;ref&gt;https://topspb.tv/news/2017/03/31/v-peterburge-poyavilos-art-prostranstvo-so-specialnoj-kameroj-dlya-selfi/ &lt;/ref&gt;  

At the moment Lux Aeterna Theater is creating a medical approach to light and sound performances. The theater group, joined by a stress expert Vladimir Brody, are further developing the relaxation effects their seances have on the spectators. The VGoray Project is about eliminating stress and work-related health problems. Studies to determine the mechanisms of the theater's impact on the humans' psycho-emotional state and the development of methods for the formation of a restoring audio-visual environment &lt;ref&gt;http://www.vgoray.com/ &lt;/ref&gt; are conducted at the Higher School of Light Design of the [[ITMO University]], at the Department of General and Clinical Psychology of [[First Pavlov State Medical University of St. Petersburg]] and at the Medical Faculty of the [[University of Debrecen]] &lt;ref&gt;http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2628418 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2635756 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Matveev N.V., Shcheglov S.A., Romanova G.E., Koneva T.A.

'''Marion Fairfax''' (October 24, 1875 – October 2, 1970) was an [[United States|American]] [[screenwriter]] and [[playwright]]. Born as '''Marion Neiswanger''' in [[Richmond, Virginia]], After she graduated from Chicago's South Division High School, she enrolled in [[Emerson College]] in Boston, Massachusetts.   She was married to actor [[Tully Marshall]] for forty-three years. Fairfax worked as a company director, director, editor, editorial director, playwright, producer, screenwriter and theatre actress.

==Early career==
Fairfax first started her career as a stage actress, just like many other women did in that era.  By 1901 she was appearing on Broadway and soon after that her own plays started appearing on Broadway.  Before she went into pictures she was known for being one of the most distinguished stage authors in the United States, writing Broadway hits such as  ''The Builders'' (1907), ''The Chaperon'' (1908), ''The Talker'' (1912), ''A Modern Girl'' (1914), In 1915 The Lasky Feature Play Company entered into a contract with Fairfax. This opportunity gave Fairfax the chance to work under [[William C. DeMille]] who is known as the author for many successful plays such as "The Warrens of Virginia" and "The Woman." The success of Fairfax comes through wide knowledge of dramatic values, not only from an author's perspective but also from that of the artist.&lt;ref name="Exhibitors"&gt;Exhibitors' Times, Inc. "Marion Fairfax, Dramaist, With Lasky." Motion Picture News Apr. 1915: 64. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairfax's production career began with the Paramount Company. During her time there she wrote the scripts to multiple successful photoplays such as ''The Clown'', ''The Honor of His House'', ''The Valley of the Giants'', ''The Westerner'', ''The Sowers'', ''The Immigrant'' and many more. In October 1920 Fairfax renewed a contract with [[Marshall Neilan]]. After building a successful resume with Neilan, which included the production and script writing of films such as ''Don't ever marry'', ''The Rivers End'', ''Dinty'' and ''Go and Get it'', Fairfax was in charge of Neilan's next four films. Her first project is based on a Ben Ames Williams magazine story called ''Not a Drum Was Heard''.&lt;ref name="mashal neilan"&gt;"Marshall Neilan Again Signs Marion Fairfax." Exhibitor's Herald 16 Oct. 1920: 41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marion Fairfax Productions==
After spending her early career with Neilan, Fairfax soon developed her own production company in 1921. At this point in her career Fairfax was known for being a famous playwright and a very successful screenwriter. Many other women have attempted to pursue careers in film at this point but it was [[Lois Weber]] and Fairfax proving that women can survive in the film industry.&lt;ref name="marion fairfax"&gt;Pierce, David, ed. "Marion Fairfax Completes Plans For Initial Independent Features." Exhibitors Herald [Chicago, Illinois] 23 Apr. 1921: 58. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitors Herald asked Fairfax about the start of her own company and she had this to say: "The formation of Marion Fairfax Productions is not the result of a sudden decision or and overnight idea. It is the realization of a plan that I have studied and worked out for over a year.&lt;ref name="photoplay"&gt;Chicago, Photoplay Magazine Publishing Company. "The Screens Newest Woman Producer." Photoplay [Chicago, Illinois] 1 July 1921: n. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; I believe there is a place for the combination of literary effort and motion picture presentation just as there is a place for the combination of literary achievement and stage presentation." With a new production company at her disposal Fairfax began working on a highly anticipated film called ''The Lying Truth'' which starred [[Marjorie Daw (actress)|Marjorie Daw]], [[J. Pat O'Malley]], [[Noah Beery, Sr.]], and [[Tully Marshall]].  Released in July 1922 ''The Lying Truth'' was quickly recognized as a masterpiece.&lt;ref name="holman day"&gt;"Holman Day and Marion Fairfax Added to Writing Staff." Exhibitor's Trade Review [New York, New York] 8 Sept. 1923, 14th ed., sec. 2: 694. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairfax's success with her own production company provided her with enough experience and credibility in the film industry to progress even further. In September 1923 she was signed to the writing staff of Associated First National Pictures, Inc. Acquiring Fairfax gave First National Picture a popular writer who at the time was specializing in original stories and adaptions of popular plays. After two years of writing for First National Editorial, Fairfax resigned from her post to enter the production field again. At the time Fairfax was one of the most accomplished playwrights in New York Theater and an author scenarist, editorial and production supervisor of film plays. Her previous experience and success as the head of Marion Fairfax Production made this transition effortless.&lt;ref name="Resigns"&gt;"Marion Fairfax Resigns Post." Motion Picture News [Hollywood, California] 19 Sept. 1925: n. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Not long after her separation from First National Picture Inc. Fairfax formed an alliance with [[Sam E. Rork]] that would cut the production cost for two producers working together. Ideally the plan would allow both producers to have shared access to technical staff by way of production scheduling. While one producer is cutting a picture and preparing for their next project the other would be utilizing the designated "shooting staff." This dual production plan allows these two independent producers to have access to a permanent technical organization.  With out a dual partnership these two producers would have a very hard time trying to afford such an imperative function of film production. In 1926 Fairfax produced ''The Blonde Saint'' (1926) and then disappeared from filmmaking. Tully Marshall died in 1943 and Fairfax died October 2, 1970.&lt;ref name="rork-fairfax"&gt;McElwee, John. "Rork-Fairfax Have New Plan." Motion Picture News [Hollywood, California] 7 Nov. 1925: 1247. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Memorial for the Victims of Nazi Military Justice''' was inaugurated on 24 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vienna to honor deserters from Hitler's army|publisher=[[Associated Press]]; [[The Guardian]]|date=20 April 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9606158|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vienna to honour Austria's Nazi army deserters|publisher=[[BBC]]News Europe|date=23 April 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13179406|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at the [[Ballhausplatz]] in the centre of [[Vienna]], opposite the President's office and the Austrian [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellory]]. The monument was created by German [[Conceptual art|conceptual artist]] [[Olaf Nicolai]]. The inscription atop the three-step sculpture features the poem by Scottish poet [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]] consisting of just two words: ''all alone''.

==Desertion, Wehrkraftzersetzung, Conscientious Objection==
Of the Germans and Austrians who deserted the [[Wehrmacht]], 15,000 men were executed. In contrast only 18 Germans who deserted in [[World War I|the first world war]] were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shot at Dawn|url=http://www.greatwar.nl/frames/default-shotatdawn.html|website=The Heritage of the Great War|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 10 percent of all victims of Nazi Military Justice were Austrians.

In June 1988 the Initiative for the Creation of a Memorial to Deserters came to life in [[Ulm]] and Neu Ulm. A central idea was, "Desertion is not reprehensible, war is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites-of-memory.de/main/ulmdeserters.html|title=Memorial to Deserters in Ulm|author=Hatlie, Mark R.|date=19 November 2005|publisher=Sites of Memory|accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common to find [[minced oath]]s in literature and media. Writers often include minced oaths instead of [[profanity]] in their writing so that they do not offend audiences or incur [[censorship]].

==Novels==

[[W. Somerset Maugham]] referred to this problem in his 1919 novel ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'', where he admitted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strickland, according to Captain Nichols, did not use exactly the words I have given, but since this book is meant for family reading, I thought it better—at the expense of truth—to put into his mouth language familiar to the domestic circle.&lt;ref name="moon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Maugham |first=W. Somerset |authorlink=W. Somerset Maugham |title=The Moon and Sixpence|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|year=1919|chapter=chapter 47 |isbn=978-0-486-44602-8|oclc=22207227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Geoffrey |title=Swearing: A Social History of Foul Language, Oaths and Profanity in English |publisher=Blackwell |year=1991 |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-631-16593-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|187}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In particular, authors of children's fiction sometimes put minced oaths into the mouths of characters who swear a lot, as a way of depicting a part of their behaviour that would be unconvincing not to represent, but also avoiding the use of swear words which would be considered unsuitable for children to read.

In 1851, [[Charles Dickens]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bark's parts of speech are of an awful sort—principally adjectives. I won't, says Bark, have no adjective police and adjective strangers in my adjective premises! I won't, by adjective and substantive! ... Give me, says Bark, my adjective trousers!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Charles |first=Dickens |authorlink=Charles Dickens |year=1851 |title=On Duty with Inspector Field |journal=Household Words |pages=151–52 |url=http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/dickens/pieces.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manis |first=Jim |year=1999 |title=Reprinted Pieces by Charles Dickens |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |location=Hazleton, Pa |series=Penn State series on Dickens |pages=150 |url=http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/dickens/pieces.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''dickens'' itself, probably from the surname, became a minced oath when referring to the devil.&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

[[Norman Mailer]]'s novel ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]''&lt;ref name="NM"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mailer |first=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |publisher=Picador |location=New York |year=1948 |edition=50 |pages=736 |isbn=978-0-312-26505-2 |url=http://www.enotes.com/naked-dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses "fug" in place of "fuck" throughout.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/12/remembering-mailer-the-high-heat-and-the-roiling-simmer/ |title=Remembering Mailer: The High Heat and the Roiling Simmer |last=Garner |first=Dwight |date=2007-11-12 |work=Paper Cuts |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanlegends.com/authors/norman_mailer.html |title=Norman Mailer: Autocrat of the Remainder Table |last=Martinetti |first=Ron |date=November 2007 |work=American Legends |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1568933/Norman-Mailer-The-streetwise-literary-master.html |title=Norman Mailer: The streetwise literary master |date=2007-10-10 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mystery writer Fran Rizer deploys "kindergarten cussin'" in her [[Callie Parrish]] series, where the main character can be heard muttering, "[[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]]!" and "[[Shih Tzu]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rizer |first=Fran |title=Casket Case |publisher=Berkley Penguin |year=2008|series=Callie Parrish |volume=3 |isbn=978-0-425-22428-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' series, characters use oaths such as "flaming" or "blood and ashes" or the interjection "light" in the same strength as a curse word, without having to print swear words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staveley |first1=Brian |title=OF LUMMOXES AND DICKHEADS: CURSING IN FANTASY |url=https://bstaveley.wordpress.com/2013/02/02/cursinginfantas/ |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science Fiction writer [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], in novels such as ''[[The Shockwave Rider]]'' and ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'', uses '[[Shiv (weapon)|Shiv]]' and '[[Pudendal cleft|slit]]' to refer to male and female body parts (and sometimes males and females) respectively.

The lead characters of [[Anthony Crowley]] (a demon) and [[Aziraphale]] (an angel) from ''[[Good Omens]]'', by [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Neil Gaiman]], both use minced oaths on a number of occasions, though for different reasons (Aziraphale genuinely means to avoid offense, while Crowley, being a demon, simply finds it more acceptable to his post to say 'gosh' instead of 'God').

In [[Stephen King]]'s 2006 novel ''[[Lisey's Story]]'', the main characters, Lisey and Scott Landon, use the word ''smuck'' instead of ''fuck'', replacing it wherever ''fuck'' would be conceivably used: ''smucking, mothersmucker, smucked up'', etc.

In the ''[[Gaunt's Ghosts]]'' series by [[Dan Abnett]], the Imperial Guardsmen use the word ''feth'' as a general all-purpose swear word, primarily to replace the word ''fuck''.

In the series ''TZA'', John Spencer uses ''spash'' in place of most curses from the second book forth.

Throughout his comic novel ''[[Myron]]'', [[Gore Vidal]] replaces various obscenities with the names of judges who were involved in an obscenity trial.

In the ''[[Codex Alera]]'' series, by Jim Butcher, most obscenities are replaced with a variation of the word crow, e.g. crows or crowbegotten.

[[Terry Pratchett]] uses minced oaths for comic effect, for example in [[Mort]]: ''"A wizard. I hate ----ing wizards." "Well, you shouldn't ---- them then," replied the second, effortlessly pronouncing a row of dashes.''  In a later book, [[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]], the character [[Discworld characters#Mr Tulip|Mr Tulip]] habitually and persistently uses a similarly diagetic form of pseudo-profane interjection throughout his dialogue.

In [[Stephen King]]'s 2009 novel ''[[Under the Dome (novel)|Under the Dome]]'', the character 'Big Jim' Rennie avoids swearing by replacing words such as ''fucking and clusterfuck'' with ''cottonpicking and clustermug''.

Ernest Hemingway substituted muck for that with which it rhymes in 'Across the River and into the Trees ' and fornicate for that with which it doesn't rhyme in 'For Whom the Bell Tolls.' It makes for some awkward constructions in the latter.

[[Spider Robinson]], in his science fiction novels, consistently uses "kark" in place of "fuck", and "taken slot" in place of "fucking slut" -- "slot" perhaps being also a reference to the female anatomy as receptacle.

[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]] features the minced oaths of "mouse-dung" and rarely "fox-dung," and others relevant to the forest are used in place of curses.

==Comic books==
In the [[Judge Dredd]] comic strip featured in ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'', the futuristic justice department approved the terms ''Stomm'', ''Drokk'', and ''Grud''. This last is a clear reference to the Christian God as it is accompanied by the apparatus of an organized religion, including "Church of Grud" and similar. Use of the terms includes the colorful "Grud on a Greenie!".&lt;ref name="E2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://everything2.com/node/497833 |title=Swear words from science fiction |last=Saunders |first=Suzanne (Segnbora-t)|date=2000-04-15 |work=[[Everything2]] |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1977 to 1979, ''2000 AD'' also featured a ''[[Dan Dare#2000 AD|Dan Dare]]'' comic strip, loosely set in the same continuity as ''Judge Dredd'', and these strips too used such parlance as ''Stomm'' and ''Drokk''.

In comic series ''[[Johnny the Homicidal Maniac]]'', the characters sometimes use the word ''fook'' in place of ''fuck''.

The DC Comics character [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], an invulnerable, intergalactic bounty hunter uses the term ''bastich'' or ''bastiches'' as a combination of bastard and bitch. i.e. "Take that you lousy bastiches!"

[[Captain Haddock]], from ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', swears unlike a real sailor with sesquipedalian ejaculations like "billions of blistering blue barnacles" and "thundering typhoons".&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=9734 |title=Billions of Blistering Blue Barnicles! |last=Lopresti |first=Rob |date=2009-11-11 |work=Criminal Brief |accessdate=2009-11-13 |location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==

In the [[Al Pacino]] epic ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', the title character [[Tony Montana]], played by Pacino, is warned by his Colombian accomplice in the censored version of the film, "Don't fool with me, Tony", and "I warned you not to fool with me, you foolish little monkey". Otherwise, the film, especially in its uncensored version, is filled with use of the word 'fuck', and the censored TV version replaces these in their dozens with 'fool'.

''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'', in the film of the same name, which is rated PG, uses minced oaths to a particularly comical effect.

In the 1945 [[war film]] ''[[A Walk in the Sun (1945 film)|A Walk in the Sun]]'', the screenplay substitutes "loving" for "fucking" (the universal American soldier's descriptor).

In ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', the character Ralphie is punished by his parents for saying "Oh, fuck," although the offensive word is replaced with "fudge" in the film.  The narrator, an adult version of Ralphie (voiced by [[Jean Shepherd]]), explains that "I didn't say fudge.  I said THE word...the queen mother of dirty words: the F-dash-dash-dash word."

In the 1984 film ''[[Johnny Dangerously]]'', the character Roman Maronie is known for butchering the English language, especially English vulgarities:
:* You ''fargin' '' sneaky ''bastages''! (You fucking sneaky bastards!)
:* Don't ''bullshtein'' me! (Don't bullshit me!)
:* You lousy ''corksuckers''. (You lousy cocksuckers.)
:* Dirty ''summina-batches''. (Dirty sons-of-bitches.)
:* I'm gonna shove 'em up your ''icehole''. (I'm gonna shove 'em up your asshole.)

One of the more infamous TV edits is that of John McClane's iconic line from ''[[Die Hard]]'', "Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker" is changed to "Yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Falcon".

The TV edit of the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', instead of having the police lineup say, "Give me the keys, you fucking cocksucker", they say "Give me the keys, you fairy godmother".

In the 1998 film ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', a well-known television edit exists of one profane-heavy scene altered. "See what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass" is changed to "See what happens when you find a stranger in the alps" and "this is what happens when you feed a stoner scrambled eggs".

A television edit of the film ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' contains the injunction "Flip you, melon farmer!" (Fuck you, motherfucker!)

A censored version of the 2004 film [[Shaun of the Dead]] contains a scene where "fuck" and "prick" are changed to "funk" and "prink", respectively. This leads to an exchange of minced oaths beginning, "it's four in the funking morning!" and ending with "it's not hip-hop, it's electro. Prink".

In Disney's 2016 animated film ''[[Zootopia]]'', Officer Judy Hopps uses the minced oath "Oh sweet cheese and crackers".
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
The televised version of the 2006 film ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' received the following edits to two of Samuel L. Jackson's lines: The line "I've had with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane" was changed to "I've had it with these monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday-to-Friday plane", and a later use of "fucking" is replaced with "freaking".

==Drama==

Late [[Elizabethan]] drama contains a profusion of minced oaths, probably due to [[Puritan]] opposition to swearing. Seven new minced oaths are first recorded between 1598 and 1602, including ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'sblood&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''By God's blood'' from [[Shakespeare]], ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'slight&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''God's light'' from [[Ben Jonson]], and ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'snails&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''By God's nails'' from the historian John Hayward.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford |year=1989|edition=2|isbn=978-0-19-861186-8|url=http://www.oed.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swearing on stage was officially banned by the [[Act to Restrain Abuses of Players|Act to Restraine Abuses of Players]] in 1606, and a general ban on swearing followed in 1623.

In some cases the original meanings of these minced oaths were forgotten; ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'struth&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (''By God's truth'') came to be spelled ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'strewth&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and ''zounds'' changed pronunciation so that it no longer sounded like ''By God's wounds''.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt;{{rp|103–105}} Other examples from this period include ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'slid&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for "By God's eyelid" (1598) and ''sfoot'' for "By God's foot" (1602). ''Gadzooks'' for "by God's hooks" (the [[nail (relic)|nails]] on [[Christian cross|Christ's cross]]) followed in the 1650s, ''egad'' for ''oh God'' in the late 17th century,&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|date=August 2006|edition=4|isbn=978-0-618-70172-8|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WCD"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laird|first=Charlton Grant|title=Webster's New World College Dictionary |editors=Guralnik, David, Agnes |publisher=Wiley, John &amp; Sons|location=Cleveland|date=April 2004|edition=4|isbn=978-0-7645-7125-1|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ods bodikins'' for "by God's little body" in 1709.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt;{{rp|13}} This is similar to the use popularized in the 1950s of ''gee whiz'' as an oath for ''Jesus' wisdom''.&lt;ref name="AHD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WCD" /&gt;

In modern times, the gang members in the musical ''[[West Side Story]]'' talk in an invented 1950s-style slang that includes several minced oaths. At the end of the "Jet Song," they sing "We're gonna beat / Every last buggin' gang / On the whole buggin' street / On the whole ever-mother-lovin' street!" where ''buggin'' and ''mother-lovin'' are obvious minced oaths.

==Television==

"Freaking" (or sometimes "fricking") is often employed on U.S. over-the-air television entertainment programming as an alternative to the adjective "fucking", as in "where's my freaking food?" It is rarely used to replace "fucking" as a term for sexual intercourse.

In the ''[[Father Ted]]'' episode "[[The Old Grey Whistle Theft]]", Ted's picnic at the local picnic area is disturbed by people claiming that he is in their "fupping spot". The man yells out "Fup off, ya grasshole" and when Ted asks them why they are talking like that, the man points to a list of picnic area rules, one of which is "No Swearing". The man finishes by yelling out "Fup off, ya pedrophile." In every single episode of ''Father Ted'' no Irish character utters the word "fuck", apart from one scene in "Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep" where the phrase "fucking hell" is shouted twice; although its attenuated alternative "[[feck]]" is heard repeatedly throughout.

In both incarnations of the television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', characters use the word "frack" ([[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original]]) or "frak" ([[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|re-imagined]]) in place of "fuck" in every sense of the word, as an interjection, as an alternative to the adjective "fucking", as in "where's my fracking food?" as well as "fuck" or "fucking" as a term for sexual intercourse. Characters in the original series also use "felgercarb" in place of "shit". Characters on ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' then adopted "frak" from ''Battlestar Galactica''.

In the TV series ''[[Farscape]]'' the characters use the word "frell" as a combination of "frig", "fuck", and "hell" (as in "What the frell is going on?"), and the word "dren" instead of "shit". "Hezmana" and "yotz" are also used as rough replacements for "hell" and "crap" respectively.

In the TV series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', characters often use the word "gorram" in place of "goddam" or "god damned." Further, the word "fuck" and its variants is replaced variously by "hump", "humped" or "rutting". For example, "I would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume I'm an evil, lecherous hump," "If they find us at all, we're humped." and "It's the chain I go get and beat you with 'til you understand who's in ruttin' command here." Additionally, the characters do much of their cursing in Mandarin Chinese. This keeps the show unobjectionable enough to air on network television, yet at the same time maintain a realistic level of profanity for a show about outlaws, inspired by the wild west.

Likewise, in ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', characters use a series of minced oaths regularly. Two such are used moderately, "Gimboid" and "goit" are derivations of "gimp" and "git" respectively (although "git" is frequently used also), but the final is a series trademark, "smeg". Although it is said to have derived from "smegma", the show's writers have said it is just a coincidence, as its similarity to the label of an Italian white-goods manufacturer. In any case, it has evolved into a word almost entirely specific to the Red Dwarf universe and numerous alterations were used in the show, such as: "smeg-head", "smeg-for-brains", "smegging", etc.

In ''[[South Park]]'' the word "[[fudge]]" (instead of "fuck") is frequently used, especially in the episode ''[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]'', where [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] sells chocolate fudge delicacies called "Fudge 'Ems", "Fudge This", "Go Fudge Yourself", "I Don't Give a Flying Fudge" and "I Just Went and Fudged Your Momma". "Lover" and "loving" are used in place of "fuck" through the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "Chickenlover". This is explained in the episode to be for the purpose of protecting young news viewers.

The television series ''[[A Bit of Fry and Laurie]]'' contains a sketch in which Fry and Laurie employ minced oaths; it is situated in a courthouse, and Laurie plays a policeman reciting the words of an offender. Examples include, "I apprehended the accused and advised him of his rights. He replied "Why don't you ram it up your pim-hole, you fusking cloff prunker."" and "Skank off, you cloffing cuck, you're all a load of shote-bag fuskers, so prunk that up your prime-ministering pim-hole." The sketch ends with Fry asking of Laurie's response to this language, and Laurie proclaiming, "I told him to mind his fucking language, m'lud."

In the Nickelodeon children's show ''[[iCarly]]'', characters often use the term "chizz" as a general purpose expletive, most often used in place of 'shit'.&amp;nbsp; ''iCarly'' is notorious for its thinly veiled adult humor.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, in the spinoff ''[[Sam &amp; Cat]]'', the term "wazz" is used in place of 'piss'.

Characters in the series ''[[The Good Place]]'' find themselves in an afterlife where they are incapable of using profanity. When they intend to curse, the word instead comes out as a benign minced oath such as "fork" for "fuck", "shirt" for "shit", or "bench" for "bitch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Erik |title=The rules of The Good Place were meant to be broken |url=https://www.avclub.com/the-rules-of-the-good-place-were-meant-to-be-broken-1822250773 |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubbing of movies for television often replaces "Fuck you!" with "Forget you!", "bastard" with "buzzard", "fucking" with "stinking", and "prick" with "pig".

==Music==

[[The Fugs]], a mid-1960s band named by [[Tuli Kupferberg]], used a euphemism for "fuck" found in [[Norman Mailer]]'s novel ([[#Novels|above]]), ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="NM" /&gt;

==Internet==

In a discussion of profanity, writer Leigh Lundin uses the glyph [[ƒ]].&lt;ref name="CB0329"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=5931|title=WTF|last=Lundin|first=Leigh|date=2009-03-29|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further discusses being "nannied" by Internet software, noting that words like cockatoo, pussycat, and even Hummer may be flagged,&lt;ref name="CB0729"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=137|title=Bad Words |chapter=Petting |last=Lundin|first=Leigh|date=2007-07-29|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has become known as the [[Scunthorpe problem]].

In that vein, [[ProBoards]] forums replace the word "cock" with "thingy", thereby transforming the statement "cock his shotgun" into "thingy his shotgun". Similarly, the [[Something Awful forums]], filters replace "fuck" with the phrase "gently caress" and "shit" with "poo-poo" for unregistered users, and the Fark website replaces words such as "fuck" with "fark".&lt;ref name="fark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/|title=Fark|last=Curtis|first=Drew|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online, [[leet|alternative typographical glyphs]] are sometimes used to evade [[profanity filter]]s (such as $hit or $#!+ instead of [[shit]], @$$ or @rse instead of [[Buttocks|ass]] or [[Buttocks|arse]]).

"fsck", from "[[fsck|'''f'''ile'''s'''ystem '''c'''hec'''k''']]", is commonly used on Usenet and in other technology-related circles to replace "fuck".

'''''Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children''''' is a contemporary fantasy [[debut novel]] by American author [[Ransom Riggs]]. The story is told through a combination of narrative and [[vernacular photography|vernacular photographs]] from the personal archives of collectors listed by the author.

This [[Young adult fiction|young adult book]] was originally intended to be a [[picture book]] featuring photographs Riggs had collected, but on the advice of an editor at [[Quirk Books]], he used the photographs as a guide from which to put together a narrative.&lt;ref name=Rife&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artssarasota.com/2011-12-16/featured/ransom-riggs-visits-alma-mater-to-discuss-miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children/ |title=Ransom Riggs visits alma mater to discuss 'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children' |last=Rife |first=Susan |date=December 16, 2011 |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64QIUDMeF?url=http://artssarasota.com/2011-12-16/featured/ransom-riggs-visits-alma-mater-to-discuss-miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children/ |archivedate=January 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/books/miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children-by-ransom-riggs/article2135190/ |title=Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, by Ransom Riggs |last=Cameron |first=Claire |date=August 19, 2011 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64QJIxvco?url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/books/miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children-by-ransom-riggs/article2135190/ |archivedate=January 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Riggs was a collector of photographs, but needed more for his novel.

==Summary==
As a child, Jacob Magellan Portman has been fascinated with his grandfather Abraham's stories about surviving as a Jew during World War II, running from man-eating monsters, and living with peculiar children in a secret home guarded by "a wise old bird". As Jacob grows older, he begins to doubt the stories until the arrival of his grandfather's death. Blood-strewn, exhausted, and lying in his back garden on the outskirts of Florida Woods, Abraham's last words are a mystery: "...find the bird in the loop on the other side of the old man's grave on September 3, 1940, and tell them what happened." As he dies, Jacob catches sight of a horrific monster just like the ones described in Abraham's stories. Soon, he starts experiencing trauma and being plagued with nightmares relating to those monsters. Believing their son to be going crazy, Jacob's parents take him to Dr. Golan, a psychiatrist, who suggests that Jacob go to Cairnholm, Wales, the location of his grandfather's children's home to confront the place of his trauma. Accompanied by his father, Jacob locates and explores the old house only to find it empty and everything caked in dust. According to the local people, the place is haunted and a bomb had killed all its inhabitants many years ago, on September 3, 1940.

Sensing a connection, Jacob refuses to give up and returns to the house one more time, where he encounters a mysterious girl who can conjure fire with her hands whom he follows, trying to question her after hearing her call out his grandfather's name. They reach the bogs surrounding the house before Jacob realizes that the people of Cairnholm are different, including the patrons at the inn and his father is not there. Luckily, a confused Jacob is rescued by the girl from before and an invisible boy, who introduce themselves as Emma Bloom and Millard Nullings respectively. A suspicious Emma holds him captive and brings him to the children's home, where he finds it magically transformed to the paradise of his grandfather's stories, complete with the peculiar children and the "wise old bird", who is in fact the headmistress Miss Alma LeFay Peregrine. There Jacob is also introduced to other peculiar children apart from Emma and Millard: Bronwyn Bruntley, a girl with incredible strength, Claire Densmore, a little girl with an extra mouth at the back of her head, Olive Abroholos Elephanta, a little girl who can levitate, Enoch O'Connor, a boy who can raise the dead by transplanting hearts for a short amount of time, Hugh Apiston, a boy with bees living in his stomach, Fiona Frauenfeld, a girl with an affinity for growing plants, and Horace Somnusson, a boy with prophetic dreams. Shocked and befuddled by the state of the place, Olive and Millard explain that they are currently existing in a [[time loop]], a place where time is constantly reversed and where they all relive the same day everyday, September 3, 1940. This is all thanks to Miss Peregrine, a special type of peculiar being known as an ''ymbryne'', one who can shapeshift into birds and manipulate time. Apart from keeping them alive (if not the bomb would have killed them), this time loop also protects the peculiar children from being hunted by hollowgast&amp;nbsp;— humanoid, tentacle-mouthed creatures that devour peculiars. That experiment occurred in the Siberian tundra, which was marked by a [[Tunguska Event|cataclysmic explosion]], and from there the hollowgast were born. In addition to hollowgast being a threat, hollows who have consumed enough peculiars are evolved into wights, beings who resemble humans in every aspect save their eyes, which have no pupils. These wights' ultimate goal is to gain power from the peculiars, as well as morph every one of their fellow hollowgast into wights that will rule the world.

Soon, Miss Peregrine's former mentor Miss Avocet arrives at the loop mad with grief over the kidnapping of her wards to wights, who have executed their plan of raiding loops. Fearing for the children's safety, Jacob is tasked with the job of reporting any suspicious information going on in the outside world. With his comings and goings, Jacob and Emma begin to develop feelings for each other, as well as get a glimpse into his own peculiar self: he can see the hollows while other peculiars can't, just like his grandfather. Miss Peregrine's fears are confirmed when eyeless sheep bodies begin to pile up, and Martin, a worker in the Cairnholm Local Museum, is killed. Going against Miss Peregrine's orders to not leave the house, Enoch, Bronwyn, Emma, Jacob and Millard escape, and Enoch uses a sheep heart to briefly bring Martin back to life. Martin manages to inform the group of the presence of a wight on the island, but by then it is too late as one appears right behind them along with a hollow companion. To Jacob's shock, he reveals himself to be Dr. Golan, as well as Jacob's family's hired lawn gardener, and Jacob's middle school bus driver. Jacob refuses Golan's offer to join him in finding peculiars, and decides to stay with his friends. Golan sends his hollow after the group, and Emma and Jacob split up from the rest. After a brief scuffle, Jacob kills it with a pair of sheep shears. They make their way back to the orphanage, but discover that Golan has kidnapped Miss Peregrine and Miss Avocet and locked the rest of the children in the house.

Dr. Golan warns them not to attempt to rescue Miss Peregrine and leaves the loop, but Millard manages to sneak out invisibly and follow him. Jacob and his friends follow Millard's tracks and find Golan near a lighthouse trying to catch a boat with his other wight comrades. During the process of saving Miss Peregrine, who is trapped in her bird form, Millard is wounded from a gunshot, but Golan is ultimately killed by Jacob. Just then, the other wights arrive and even though they are able to rescue Miss Peregrine, Miss Avocet is taken away. Returning to the orphanage, they find it destroyed, leaving them having to track down the wights and discover how to help Miss Peregrine. It is then Jacob decides to follow his friends and returns to the present to say goodbye to his father, but promises to return when his mission is finished. Guided by only a prophetic dream from Horace, they set sail to find help.

==Peculiardom==

===Peculiars===
Otherwise known as ''syndrigast'' (a word meaning "peculiar spirit" in the Old Peculiar language, which is in turn the author's adaptation of Old English, or Anglo-Saxon language), peculiar folk are a branch of humanity possessing a second soul which manifests itself in strange ways such as abnormal characteristics and abilities commonly referred to as ''peculiarities''.  Very rarely are peculiar children born to peculiar parents as the essence or gene of peculiarity often skips entire generations, making peculiar population vastly less than that of normal people.

===Ymbrynes===
An '''ymbryne''' (pronounced ''IMM-brinn'') is a specific kind of female peculiar who can transform into distinct birds, control and manipulate time as she sees fit, and govern the peculiar world. Most essentially, the ability to control time lets these women possess a period of historical time by looping it, creating a potentially eternal sanctuary for peculiars. They often set out into the present-day world to rescue peculiars in dire situations or to search for those without an ymbryne. ''Ymbryne'' means "revolution" or "circuit" in Old Peculiar.

===Council of Ymbrynes===
The '''Council of Ymbrynes''' is the official government and law of peculiardom. Their responsibilities include the maintenance of loop order, the writing or amending of laws on a regular basis, and the determination of sentences for those convicted of a crime. Members are not specified.

===Time Loops===
'''Time loops''' are the fabric of the peculiar world, often referred to as peculiardom. Similar to towns, cities, states, and countries, they act as specific locations. Together they create a vast and quite complex world of varying whereabouts and dates only peculiars are able to enter. Within these loops, peculiars live indefinitely without aging or reliving previous experiences, even as the day around them repeats itself. While it may appear to be a form of eternal youth, it is the suspension of time inevitable. In reality, many, if not all, of Miss Peregrine's children are over fifty years old, but the loop detains them as teenagers and small children physically and mentally. A loop must be reset daily or it will collapse, leaving all peculiars within it exposed to the outside world.

===Aging Forward===
As a result of time loops, those who reside in them may not be able to return to the present day, depending on how long they've been there.  In a mere matter of hours outside of the loop, the amount of time evaded will catch up.  An example of this is Miss Peregrine's own former ward, a young girl named Charlotte who left the loop while Miss Peregrine was away.  She was discovered by police in the mid-1980s and sent to a welfare agency.  When Miss Peregrine found her just two days later, she'd already aged thirty-five years.  Although she survived the ordeal, the unnatural aging process had caused Charlotte a great deal of mental disorder, and she was sent to live with Miss Nightjar, an ymbryne more suited for her care.  The same process of deterioration applies to anything taken out of time loops as another instance was an apple Jacob took back to the inn where he and his father were staying in the present day. He left it on the nightstand next to his bed as he fell asleep that night, but by morning, found it had rotted to the point of disintegrating.

===Hollowgast===
A word meaning "empty spirit". The '''hollowgast''' are monsters who feed on peculiars. They were created by a freak-accident in an unethical and illegal experiment conducted by Miss Peregrine's two brothers. Hundreds had joined their cause, and with the aid of misguided but powerful ymbrynes, it was intended to achieve immortality without the limitations of time loops. Instead, it led to a catastrophic collapse that destroyed half of Siberia where the experiment took place. Everyone involved was presumed dead, but their corpses became deformed and crawled back to a lesser, animalistic state of life. Apart from their shadows, hollows are invisible to all but a gifted few including Abraham and Jacob Portman. They are also identified by the groups of large tentacle-like tongues that occupy their grotesquely stretched mouths. It is speculated that this outcome was the result of being reverse-aged to a time before their souls existed, thus the word ''hollowgast''. Their souls having been erased, hollows possess no form of peculiarity and cannot enter time loops.

===Wights===
If a hollow consumes enough peculiar souls, its original human form is restored, with the exception of irises and pupils leaving the eyes entirely white.  Because of this, peculiars refer to these evolved creatures as '''wights'''.  They possess no extraordinary abilities but are highly skilled in posing as normal people under multiple identities and can even pass into time loops.  Much of their existence revolves around procuring peculiars for remaining hollows to devour.

==Characters==
===Peculiar Children===
*'''Jacob Magellan Portman''' — A 16-year-old American teenager and the protagonist of the story.  Jacob becomes subject to [[acute stress reaction]] after witnessing his grandfather's death and claiming that a monster from his grandfather's childhood stories had killed him.  Everyone he knows begins to consider him crazy and avoids him.  His parents eventually take him to see a psychiatrist, on whose instruction Jacob's dad takes him on a trip to the Welsh island where his grandfather grew up.  There, Jacob discovers that the stories of a magical orphanage and peculiar children are real and so is the monster.  He also learns that the ability to see these monsters is actually an extremely rare peculiarity as they are invisible to all but a few like himself.
*'''Abraham Portman''' — Abraham was Jacob's grandfather who also had the peculiarity of seeing the monsters.  He left Miss Peregrine's loop as a young man to join both the war against Germany and the war against the hollowgast, promising to make a home in America for his fellow peculiars.  But having started a family of his own during his time in the normal world, he never went back for them.  In spite of this, he was still pressured into eradicating hollows, resulting in long, frequent hunting-trips away from his wife and two children, a secret which they took as careless neglect.  Over the years, Abraham became a near-stranger to everyone he knew and, in his old age, was killed by one of the very monsters he had fought so valiantly to defeat.  Police simply concluded that dementia and an attack by wild animals were the cause of his death.
*'''Emma''' '''Bloom'''— Emma is a teenager under Miss Peregrine's care. Her peculiarity manifested in her hands when she was ten years old.  They began to glow red, becoming painfully hot to the point of generating fire. Miss Peregrine found her abandoned at a traveling circus.  Emma had a romantic relationship with Abraham which they maintained even as he went to war until he stopped responding to her letters.  After years without replying, Abraham finally wrote her back simply to tell her he could no longer do so because he'd married another woman.  Emma became heartbroken and bitter but still mourned him upon learning of his death when his grandson Jacob arrived in Miss Peregrine's time loop.  Although she treated Jacob harshly at first, their mutual sorrow for Abraham started a deeply sincere relationship between them.  
*'''Millard Nullings''' — Millard is a young adolescent possessing the peculiarity of invisibility which is said to be quite uncommon.  He chooses to go about nude to stay fully invisible, but wears clothes at supper on Miss Peregrine's orders.  He is also exceptionally well-versed in all things peculiar and, as a hobby, spends much of his time documenting every little detail of the day they live in.
*'''Bronwyn Bruntley''' — A young adolescent possessing super-human strength, Bronwyn is also kindhearted and a loyal friend.  She respects and obeys Miss Peregrine more than her fellow wards do, often correcting them and citing rules they're meant to follow, mostly in fear of anyone getting in trouble.  The only occasions for which she refuses to cooperate are when she is made to dress lady-like.  Before Miss Peregrine took her and her older brother Victor in, Bronwyn discovered her own strength at the age of ten when she snapped their abusive stepfather's neck without actually meaning to.
*'''Enoch O'Connor''' — A young adolescent with the ability to [[necromancy|resurrect the dead]] and bring inanimate objects to life for a limited time by using the extracted organs of other living things.  Enoch was born to a family of [[funeral director|undertakers]] and, before moving into time loops, caused tremendous confusion by frequently bringing the dead to life at his father's funeral parlor.  He is the least liked of Miss Peregrine's wards as the others are put off by his selfish behavior, negative thinking, and obsession with violence.  His previous ymbryne was never specified, nor were his reasons for relocating to Miss Peregrine's loop.
*'''Olive Abroholos Elephanta''' — Olive is the second youngest to Claire and comes across as quite giddy and openly friendly. Her peculiarity renders her lighter than air, making her float freely like a balloon.  She has barely any control over it and must always be weighted down or bound to something to keep from floating away.  Her most routine means is a pair of heavy leaden shoes.
*'''Hugh Apiston''' — Hugh is a teenager with bees living in his stomach.  His peculiarity allows him to communicate with them and command them.
*'''Horace Somnusson''' — Horace is a young adolescent capable of having prophetic dreams, albeit very scarcely.  They occur most often as nightmares of events so horrifying, they have a tendency to throw him into bouts of shock.  He can be quite a snob and is an extremely passionate follower of fashion, commonly seen in a suit and tie with a top hat and monocle.
*'''Fiona Frauenfeld''' — Fiona is a teenager possessing power over plants.  Her peculiarity allows her to manipulate their life and growth and control their movements.  She speaks with a thick Irish accent, though she rarely speaks at all, and has a romantic, [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with Hugh.
*'''Claire Densmore''' — The youngest of all Miss Peregrine's wards, Claire also possesses the most grotesque peculiarity in their midst: a second mouth in the back of her head with sharp teeth, hidden beneath her blonde curls.  She is typically cheerful but becomes shy and self-conscious when made to dine with others.
*'''Victor Bruntley''' — Miss Peregrine once had many more peculiars under her care, many of whom were killed by the hollowgast, including Bronwyn's older brother Victor.  Like Bronwyn, Victor possessed immense physical strength.  He left during the loop's early days, claiming he couldn't stand being trapped there; it was a reckless decision which led to his demise.  Until his burial when the loop closed, his lifeless body had remained at Miss Peregrine's home, locked away in his bedroom and neatly laid to rest in bed.  Some of the children would occasionally sneak in and have Enoch resurrect him, though he always seemed to be in a rush to get back to the afterlife.

===Ymbrynes===
All ymbrynes take on last names which correspond to the type of bird into which they can shapeshift (e.g., Miss Peregrine can turn into a [[peregrine falcon]]).

* '''Alma LeFay Peregrine'''&amp;nbsp;— Miss Peregrine is a highly skilled ymbryne and the headmistress of her children's-home. She is a delicate woman who enjoys smoking a pipe and adores her charges, though she can be strict at times.  At a very young age, she learned to hone her peculiarity as a student under Miss Avocet.  Miss Peregrine's loop is located on the fictional island of Cairnholm, Wales, on September 3, 1940, though it's actually September 2 for the first few hours.
* '''Esmerelda Avocet'''&amp;nbsp;— Miss Avocet is an elderly and wise woman from the mid-Victorian period in England.  Having taught most notable ymbrynes to master their craft, she is regarded as near-royalty.  Her loop is in Derbyshire on [[Swithun|July 15]], 1867, but it was invaded by wights and hollowgast, forcing her to flee to Miss Peregrine's loop.
* '''Miss Nightjar'''&amp;nbsp;— Miss Nightjar takes in difficult cases of peculiars.  One such case being Miss Peregrine's former ward, Charlotte.  Miss Nightjar's loop is in Swansea, Wales on April 3, 1901 and is co-run by Miss Thrush.
* '''Miss Finch'''&amp;nbsp;— Miss Finch  has an aunt who is also an ymbryne but prefers to stay in [[finch]] form.  Their loop is based in London, but the date is not stated.
* '''Millicent Thrush'''&amp;nbsp;— Miss Thrush has a loop in London and is headmistress of a children's home there but also co-runs Miss Nightjar's special-care home.
* '''Miss Kestrel'''&amp;nbsp;— Possibly a rather historical ymbryne.  Enoch mentions an old story of her being injured in a road accident.  The incident is said to have trapped her in the form of a [[kestrel]] for an entire week, leading to the collapse of her loop before she healed.  Location and date are not stated.
* '''Balenciaga Wren'''&amp;nbsp;— Miss Wren is the headmistress of a menagerie for peculiar animals.  Her loop is based in mainland Wales in a much older, unknown time.
* '''Miss Gannett'''&amp;nbsp;— Miss Gannett has a loop in Ireland, in June of 1770.
* '''Miss Treecreeper'''&amp;nbsp;— Miss Peregrine mentions her name but doesn't remember where or when her loop is based.

===Non-Peculiars===
* '''Franklin Portman'''&amp;nbsp;— Jacob's father, Frank, is an unemployed, amateur ornithologist who volunteers at a bird rescue and likes to pass it off as his job.  He also spends much of his time writing manuscripts for nature books, though he's never completed one, giving up on his every project midway.  His whole life, he's had a rather rough relationship with his own father, Abraham, as he was almost never around.  Frank is very protective of his son, but understands his need for room to grow and learn on his own.
* '''Maryann Portman'''&amp;nbsp;— Maryann is Jacob's obsessively materialistic mother and Franklin's wife. She comes from a wealthy family that owns a drugstore company with one hundred and fifteen branches across the state of Florida.  While she loves her son and is immensely protective of him, she tends to be more concerned about public image and what people think of them.
*'''Dr. Golan'''&amp;nbsp;— Dr. Golan was one of the many peculiars who supported and participated in the disastrous experiment that created the hollowgast.  He is among those who have reached the state of being a wight, a term he disowns as "their word."  He is a licensed psychiatrist and, in order to uncover information on Miss Peregrine's loop, has been stalking the Portman family for years under many a guise including their yard man, Jacob's middle school bus driver Mr. Barron, and ultimately himself when Jacob begins seeing him for therapy.
*'''Malthus'''&amp;nbsp;— Malthus was once a peculiar and an old friend of Dr. Golan's who also joined the rebellion against the ymbrynes, dying by the results of the experiment designed to overthrow them and reemerging a hollow.  He now travels with the restored Golan, devouring peculiars as they discover time loops.  For reasons not specified, Golan allowed him to kill Abraham before they could learn the location of Miss Peregrine's loop.  From then on, Malthus haunted Jacob, keeping a vigil on him day and night.
*'''Martin Pagett'''&amp;nbsp;— Martin is a part-time but knowledgeable and well-spoken curator of a small museum on Cairnholm, though due to the island's sparse renown and low tourist appeal, they rarely see any patronage.  He strikes up a bond with Jacob, giving him a rundown of Cairnholm's history and assisting him in learning how the children's home was destroyed.  Martin plays an unwitting but vital role in discovering Malthus and Dr. Golan on the island.
*'''Oggie'''&amp;nbsp;— Oggie is Martin's uncle, whom he introduces to Jacob in order to help him learn more about the fallen children's home.  Elderly and gruff but still sharp of wit, Oggie recalls the strange children and their reclusive headmistress and recounts the bombing in detail, occasionally veering off into rants on the weather and politics.  Though he longed to fight for his country, he was too young then and merely watched it all take place.
* '''Susan Portman'''&amp;nbsp;— Susan is Frank's younger sister and Jacob's aunt.  While going through Abraham's possessions with them after his passing, she found his copy of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|''The Selected Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson'']] and that he had written a brief well-wish to Jacob on the title page.  When she gives it to him on his birthday, Jacob unwittingly discovers a letter from Miss Peregrine when it fell out from between the pages.
*'''Ricky'''&amp;nbsp;— Ricky is described as Jacob's best and only friend, though their relationship is more of a deal for personal benefit: in exchange for Jacob helping Ricky with his homework, Ricky acts as Jacob's bodyguard at school.

'''Music Together''' is a music and movement program for children aged [[newborn]] through [[second grade]]. First offered to the public in 1987, the program is now offered in over 3000 communities in the [[United States]], as well as over 40 other countries around the world. This expansion has been accomplished through independent centers which are licensed to use the program. All teachers must attend and pass a Music Together teacher training.

Since its inception, Music Together has emphasized the importance of having parents and caregivers actively participate in class with their children. This is based in part on the work of early childhood educator [[Lilian Katz]], who noted that while children can learn skills and knowledge from any adult, they learn dispositions only from their loved ones; by participating in class as musical role-models, parents and caregivers help impart to their children the disposition to become lifelong music-makers.

==Philosophy==
Music Together starts with the premise that all children are musical, and that they can achieve basic music competence provided their music environment is sufficiently rich. All class activities are based on [[Developmentally Appropriate Practice]], an approach to learning that takes into account how children really learn at different developmental stages in their lives. Because very young children learn primarily through play, the program provides a fun, relaxed environment with a nonformal teaching approach.

Some critics of this and other early childhood music programs have questioned whether an organized class is necessary to teach children a basic life skill such as singing. However, children can no longer reliably learn music skills from their surrounding environment, as they could several generations ago, due to a steady decrease in live music-making activities available to them. A study done by Levinowitz &lt;ref&gt;Levinowitz, L. et al.” Measuring singing voice development in the elementary general music classroom." ''Journal of Research in Music Education,46'', Spring 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that fewer than 50% of first-graders could sing in tune.

Music learning is in many ways analogous to language learning; just as the child seems to teach their self language through interacting with a language environment, they teach their self music through being in a music environment. When adults model active singing and movement behaviors, the child imitates and learns. The combination of classroom activities and at-home music-making inspired by a recording and songbook help children learn music skills naturally and effortlessly.

==Repertoire and recordings==
Music Together is noted for a repertoire which emphasizes the use of a wide variety of [[musical modes]] (tonalities) and metres. With much of the music of our culture—especially “children’s music”—using predominantly [[major scale]]s and [[Metre (music)|duple metre]], it is difficult for children to gain a breadth of music experience. The Music Together repertoire includes songs in such tonalities as [[Phrygian mode]], [[aeolian mode]], [[Mixolydian]] mode, and [[Dorian mode]]. Children are also introduced to songs using [[triple metre]] and “unusual” metres such as 5/4 or 7/8. In this way, the Music Together repertoire helps strengthen children’s [[audiation]], a termed coined by learning theorist Edwin Gordon to describe the process by which we mentally hear and comprehend music. The ability to audiate is essential to any meaningful music learning.

There are nine non-sequential Music Together song collections, named Bongos, Bells, Triangle, Fiddle, Drum, Tambourine, Flutes, Sticks and Maracas, forming a three-year cycle taught in fall, winter, and spring semesters. There are also three summer collections, named Summer Songs I, Summer Songs II, and Summer Songs III, which are compilations carefully designed not to include songs from the spring collections before them or the fall collections after them. Families receive one CD and a code to download all of the songs each semester, along with an accompanying illustrated songbook, to facilitate at-home family music-making. The recordings are professionally produced and richly orchestrated, and feature a “family” of singers, representing a mother, father, child, grandmother, and uncle.

==History==
Music Together was founded by Kenneth K. Guilmartin, a composer and musician certified in Dalcroze [[Eurhythmics]]. In 1985 Guilmartin founded the Center for Music and Young Children (CMYC) to research and develop early childhood music programs for Birch Tree Group, Ltd., publishers of the [[Suzuki]] Method.

In 1986 Guilmartin began to collaborate with Lili M. Levinowitz, Ph.D., at that time a doctoral student directing the Children’s Music Development Program at [[Temple University]]. Levinowitz was a student of learning theorist Edwin Gordon, known for his Music Learning Theory.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Edwin E. A Music Learning Theory for Newborn and Young Children. Chicago: GIA Publication, Inc., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Guilmartin and Levinowitz were influenced by Gordon’s work, and included tonal patterns and rhythm patterns based on his work in their new program.

Music Together was first offered to the public in 1987 in a suburb of [[Philadelphia]]. After a brief residence at Westminster Conservatory of Music in [[Princeton, NJ]], the company moved to a studio on Nassau Street in Princeton in 1989, the same year that it offered its first teacher training. In 1997, the year of its tenth anniversary, the company moved to 66 Witherspoon St. in Princeton, with room for its lab school as well as offices. In 2006, the company moved into a newly renovated {{convert|15000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building in [[Hopewell, NJ]], just outside Princeton.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4992">'''New Music Economy''' is a term describing the emergent social, technical, political and economic context of the [[creative industries]]. This shift in context has been fueled by concurrent evolution within an ecosystem of interdependent technologies, institutions, and individuals; the result of which impacts the nature of creative property, identity, production, distribution and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Touve, David, Pho List, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The term New Music Economy is evolving out of new [[Consumer behaviour|consumer behavior]], methods of promotion and sales.

== Term usage history ==
Notable changes in the economic stability of the music industry started in the late 1990s with the advent of [[File sharing|P2P file sharing]]. [[The Long Tail]] theory is a benchmark in the music industry for new economic concepts. The nuance of infinite shelf space opened up economic opportunity for independent record labels around the world. The term New Music Economy first emerged in 2007.
* Tim Westergren (Founder &amp; CSO, Pandora) &amp; Gideon D'Arcangelo (New York University) lead an event March 13, 2007 in Palo Alto, CA titled "Social Interactions in the New Music Economy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baychi.org/calendar/20070313/|title=Active Listening: Social Identity in the New Music Economy|date=2007-03-13|publisher=BayCHI|accessdate=2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Venture Capitalist Fred Wilson began using the term "New Music Economy" in his blog on April 4, 2008.
* The San Fran Music Tech Summit used the term "New Music Economy" as a title of a Marketing Panel on May 8, 2008. The Panel &amp; Audience of thought leaders attempted to create a formal definition for New Music Economy. The group wrote a list with 12 necessary components in defining the term New Music Economy:
** Music Licensing
** Co-Marketing
** Branding with New Tools
** Non Traditional Retail Space
** Digital Distribution

==Personal life==
Nicholas Wolterstorff lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan with his wife Claire. He has 4 grown children and 1 that died at age 25 while mountain climbing in Austria. He has seven grandchildren.

==Thought==
While an undergraduate at Calvin College, Wolterstorff was greatly influenced by professors [[William Harry Jellema]], [[Henry Stob]] and [[Henry Zylstra]], who introduced him to schools of thought that have dominated his mature thinking: Reformed theology and [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|common sense]] philosophy (these have also influenced the thinking of Wolterstorff's friend and colleague [[Alvin Plantinga]], another alumnus of Calvin College).

Wolterstorff  builds upon the ideas of the Scottish common sense philosopher [[Thomas Reid]], who approached knowledge "from the bottom-up". Instead of reasoning about [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] conditions of knowledge, Wolterstorff suggests that knowledge and our knowing faculties are not the subject of our research but have to be seen as its starting point. Wolterstorff rejects classical [[foundationalism]] and instead sees knowledge as based upon insights in reality which are direct and indubitable.

'''Norwegian Design Council''' ({{lang-no|Norsk Designråd}}) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] state-controlled [[stiftelse|foundation]] that encouraged good [[design]] of Norwegian products as a key to improved innovation and the products international reputation and sales.

Among the activities of the Norwegian Design Council were awarding the  ''Merket for God Design'' and ''Design Effekt'' awards. It also cooperated closely with [[Innovation Norway]] concerning new ventures. The council worked as a competence centre and was funded by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry]], through consulting and through other projects. 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Norsk_Designr%C3%A5d Katrine Kalleklev: ''Norsk Designråd'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Merket_for_god_design Katrine Kalleklev: ''Merket for god design'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Design_Effekt Katrine Kalleklev: ''Design Effekt''(Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian Design Council was founded in 1963 by the [[Norwegian Export Council]] and the [[Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise]]. In 2014, the '''Norwegian Design and Architecture Centre''' (''Norsk design- og arkitektursenter'') was established as a fusion of the Norwegian Design Council with the '''Norwegian Form''' (''Norsk Form''), a national institution working in the fields of design, architecture, and urban development. The combined entity is housed in two renovated industrial buildings by the [[Aker River]] on Hausmanns gate in [[Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Norsk_Form Charlotte Sætre and  Katrine Kalleklev: ''Norsk Form'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Norsk_design-_og_arkitektursenter Katrine Kalleklev: ''Norsk design- og arkitektursenter'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pathfinder Mural''' is a work of art formerly located at 410 West Street in the [[New York City]] neighborhood known as the [[West Village]].  It was conceived of by [[artist]] [[Mike Alewitz]] in 1988 and painted as a collaboration among eighty artists from twenty nations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themilitant.com/1996/6027/6027_4.html The Militant - 7/22/96 - 'Pathfinder Mural Stood As A Beacon Of Hope'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; who painted it on the side of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) building housing the [[Pathfinder Press]], the publishing arm of the [[Pathfinder tendency]], a [[left-wing]] organization.

==Subject==
The mural consisted of a red-colored [[printing press]] in the center, out of which seemed to flow posters of revolutionary heroes, with crowds of people depicted above and below the press.  Well-known activists and political figures included [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Stephen Biko]], and [[Harriet Tubman]].  The press itself is printing Fidel Castro's words, "The truth must not be only the truth--it must also be told."

==History==

The SWP commissioned the mural at the suggestion of Alewitz, a long-time member of the party.  

Participants in the project included artists such as [[Armand Vaillancourt]], [[Dumile Feni]], [[Arnoldo Guillien]] and [[Carlos Montenegro]].  There were also other, anonymous contributors with revolutionary and/or working-class backgrounds.  

In an interview with the [[New York Times]] dated September 7, 1997, Alewitz said of the mural "I wanted to do this one because Pathfinder represents the tradition of publishing important revolutionary ideas.  I'm critical of the New York art scene.  I find that much of the art taught in the schools and produced through the gallery system reflects the values of the cynical and confused middle class.  Basically, a stronger art is produced in those societies--like Cuba and Nicaragua--where there's a pulling together, an optimism about going forward."

Political conflicts, however, beset the project. From the right, [[Patrick Buchanan]] attacked it in the [[Washington Times]] as "a six-story shrine to communism, a Marxist Mount Rushmore in Greenwich Village." More disruptive to the project were criticisms from the SWP itself who criticized Alewitz' vision of a work that would depict revolutionary heroes as human beings and insisted on an homage to the party's heroes and attempted to micromanage the project by issuing directives on matters such as how large Leon Trotsky's head should be. 

A quotation from [[Eugene Debs]]' famous anti-war speech made in [[Canton, Ohio]] were replaced with words from Fidel Castro. Also removed were personal touches by Alewitz such as depictions of two students [[Kent State shootings|killed by the National Guard at Kent State University]] in 1970, one of whom had been a close friend of Alewitz’s.

Alewitz was expelled from the SWP prior to the project's conclusion and was excluded from its opening ceremony.

In 1996, the mural was permanently removed in order to repair cracks in the exterior wall of the Pathfinder building.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5702">'''Plastic arts''' are [[art form]]s which involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by [[Molding (process)|molding]] or modeling such as [[sculpture]] or [[ceramic art|ceramics]]. 

Less often, and less usefully, the term may be used broadly for all the [[visual arts]] (such as painting, sculpture, film and photography), as opposed to literature and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plastic%20arts |title=Merriam-Webster Online (entry for "plastic arts") |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials for use in the plastic arts, in the narrower definition, include those that can be carved or shaped, such as stone or wood, [[concrete]], glass, or [[metal]].

The term "[[plastic]]" has been used to mean certain synthetic organic resins ever since they were invented, but the term "plastic arts" long preceded them. 

The term should not be confused, either, with [[Piet Mondrian]]'s concept of "[[Neoplasticism]]".

=='Plastic' and the philosophy of art==
In contrast to the limiting of 'plastic arts' to sculpture and architecture by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] in 1807,&lt;ref&gt;Russian Romantic Criticism: An Anthology, edited by Lauren Gray Leighton, Published by Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987,  {{ISBN|0313255849}}, {{ISBN|978-0313255847}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German critic [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] (1767-1845) applied the concept not only to visual arts, but also poetry. 

Classical poetry lines he saw utilizing plastic isolation, and rhyme falling under the Romantic (domain). &lt;ref&gt;''The literary theories of August Wilhelm Schlegel'' by Ralph W. Ewton jnr, Published by Walter de Gruyter and Co (1972), {{ISBN|3110991632}}, {{ISBN|978-3110991635}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In Schlegel's Viennese lectures (1809-1811), published in 1827 as ''On the Theory and History of the Plastic Arts'', he contrasted the plasticism of Classical Art with picturesque Romanticism. He {{quotation|"operated with the antinomy of terms plastic/pictorial, mechanically/ organically, finite/ infinite, and closed/accomplished. Schlegel stated that the spirit of the entire antique culture and poetry was plastic and that the spirit of modern culture, however, was picturesque (pittoresk)".|&lt;ref&gt;''Civic Art Then and Now: The Culture of Good Place-making'' by Charles C. Bohl, in Sitte, Hegemann and the Metropolis: Modern Civic Art and International Exchanges, edited by Charles Bohl and Jean-François Lejeune, Published by Routledge, 2009, {{ISBN|0415424070}}, {{ISBN|978-0415424073}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  These distinctions were carried over into Russian Romanticism aesthetics, {{quotation|"[[Dmitry Venevitinov|Venevitinov]] objected to the indiscriminate use of the term 'pictures'. 

In his use of August Schlegel's term 'plastic' (''plastisch'', ''plastika'') he argues for a return to the simple, primitive, enclosed, defined, limited, finite, corporeal, and plastic world of the ancients. There seem to have been two interpretations of the plastic - picturesque contrast (antitheses) in Romantic Idealist philosophy.  As Venevitinov uses the contrast, and as August Schlegel intended it to be used when he defined it in Lecture I of ''Vorlesungen über dramatische Kunst und Literatur'', it denoted the difference between the corporeal mind of the man of antiquity and the 'picturesque' mind of modern man.  Ancient art appeals directly to the senses, modern art gives rise to mental pictures or images. The former is therefore real and corporeal, the latter ideal."|&lt;ref&gt;Russian Romantic Criticism: An Anthology, edited by Lauren Gray Leighton, Published by Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987,  {{ISBN|0313255849}}, {{ISBN|978-0313255847}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s '''Pomological Watercolor Collection''' is an archive of some 7500 botanical watercolors created for the USDA between the years 1886 and 1942 by around five dozen artists.&lt;ref name=pomo/&gt; Housed by the [[United States National Agricultural Library]], it is a unique resource documenting existing fruit and nut cultivars, new introductions, and specimens discovered by USDA's plant explorers, representing 38 plant families in all.&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt; It has been called "one of the world's most unusual holdings of late 19th and early 20th century American botanical illustrations".&lt;ref name=ars/&gt;

The archive spans the years in which American agriculture greatly expanded the range of fruits and vegetables grown on a commercial scale and developed many new cultivars. The USDA artists created the watercolors in an effort to catalog these cultivars—many of which went under different names in different regions of the United States—and to show the damage resulting from typical diseases and pests of specific fruits. During this period, many of the watercolors were issued as lithographic illustrations in USDA bulletins and the department's annual yearbooks.&lt;ref name=dgp/&gt;

==History of the collection==
The period between 1886 and 1916—when most of these watercolors were painted—was a time when the major fruit-producing regions in the United States were just beginning to emerge, as farmers worked with the USDA to establish orchards for expanding markets. Photography was not yet in widespread use as a documentary medium, so the government relied on artists to produce technically accurate drawings of cultivars for its publications.&lt;ref name=fusonie/&gt;

Some 65 different artists are represented in the collection, of whom one-third were women; working as a government illustrator was one of the few artists' jobs open to women at a time when they were just beginning to be able to gain formal training at American art schools.&lt;ref name=djk/&gt; All but a handful of the collection's 7584 watercolors were created by just nine of the artists, of whom six were women. The top three contributors were [[Deborah Griscom Passmore]], [[Amanda Newton (illustrator)|Amanda Almira Newton]], and [[Mary Daisy Arnold]], who each painted over 1000 watercolors and between them are responsible for half the collection. Passmore's watercolors in particular have been called the finest done by the early USDA illustrators and a national treasure.&lt;ref name=fusonie/&gt; Among the other most prolific artists were [[Royal Charles Steadman]] (over 850 watercolors), [[J. Marion Shull]] (who later became a noted plant breeder; over 750 watercolors), [[Ellen Isham Schutt]] (over 700), Bertha Heiges (over 600), [[Elsie Lower Pomeroy|Elsie E. Lower]] (over 250), [[William Henry Prestele]] (over 100), and the noted [[mycologist]] [[Louis Charles Christopher Krieger]].  

Slightly over half of the watercolors show apple cultivars, a good many of which are no longer cultivated.&lt;ref name=pomo/&gt; The remainder range from common types of fruits and nuts (grapes, berries, stone fruit, melons, citrus, walnuts, hickory nuts) to lesser-known native fruits ([[Amelanchier|Eastern shadbush]]) and species newly introduced in the United States or not yet grown there: [[cherimoya]], [[avocado]], [[natal plum]], [[sweetsop]], etc. The specimens depicted were collected throughout the United States and its territories and in nearly 30 other countries as well.&lt;ref name=pomo/&gt; The typical watercolor in the collection depicts the whole fruit (sometimes with its leaves) together with a half-view showing its flesh and seeds; some show the fruit in a diseased state.

Associated with the proletarian arts movement in Japan, it primarily used small gauge films such as [[16mm film]] and [[9.5mm film]] to record demonstrations and workers' lives and show them in organized events or, using mobile projection teams, at factories and mines. It also published its own journals. Most of its films were [[documentaries]] or [[newsreels]], but Prokino also made [[fiction films]] and [[animated films]]. Prominent members included [[Akira Iwasaki]] and [[Genjū Sasa]], although in its list of supporters one finds such figures as [[Daisuke Itō (film director)|Daisuke Itō]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Shigeharu Nakano]], [[Tomoyoshi Murayama]], [[Kiyohiko Ushihara]], [[Kogo Noda]], [[Takiji Kobayashi]], [[Sōichi Ōya]], [[Fuyuhiko Kitagawa]], [[Tokihiko Okada]], [[Matsuo Kishi]], [[Kiyoshi Miki]], [[Denmei Suzuki]], [[Teppei Kataoka]], and [[Shigeyoshi Suzuki (film director)|Shigeyoshi Suzuki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17370">{{Culture of Qatar}}
The modern '''[[Qatar]]i art''' movement emerged in the mid-20th century, as a result of the new-found wealth acquired from oil exports and subsequent modernization of Qatari society. Because of [[Islam]]'s non-inclusive stance of [[Aniconism in Islam|depictions of sentient beings]] in visual arts, paintings historically played an insignificant role in the country's culture.&lt;ref name="abusaud140"&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Other visual art forms such as calligraphy, architecture and textiles were more highly regarded in the [[Bedouin]] tradition.&lt;ref name="abusaud140"/&gt;

==Development of modern art==
[[File:MuseumOfIslamicArtEntrance.jpg|thumb|[[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]], inaugurated in 2008]]
The art scene in Qatar witnessed substantial development in the mid- and late 1950s. Initially, arts were overseen by the Ministry of Education, with [[art exhibition]]s being hosted in its facilities.&lt;ref name="abusaud142"/&gt; In 1972, the government started providing increased funding to aid the development of arts within the country. The father of modern artists in Qatar is Jassim Zaini (1943–2012), whose work explored diversity in techniques and documented the changing society from traditional local life to a global style. The Qatari Fine Arts Society was established in 1980 with the objective of promoting the works of Qatari artists.&lt;ref name="abusaud142"/&gt; In 1998, the National Council for Culture, Arts and Heritage was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qatarconsulatela.org/about-qatar/culture-arts/|title=Culture &amp; Arts|publisher=Consulate General of the State of Qatar|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Qatar Museums]] was established in the early 2000s to build and connect all museums and collections in Qatar. Two major museums  lead the institution: the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]] opened in 2008, and the [[Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art]], opened in Education City by [[Qatar Foundation]] in 2010.

==Prehistoric art==
[[File:Jebel_Jassassiyeh_rock_carvings.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Rock carvings in [[Jebel Jassassiyeh]] depicting a boat]]
Ancient [[petroglyph|rock carvings]] have been discovered in eight separate locations in Qatar: [[Jebel Jassassiyeh]], Jabel Fuwayrit, [[Freiha]], [[Al Ghariyah]], Al Jumail, [[Simaisma]], [[Al Wakrah]] and Al Kassar. Most of these sites were discovered by Danish archaeological teams in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="nayeem7"&gt;Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The carvings are classified in a number of categories, including human and animal representation, boat representation, [[Cup and ring mark|cup-marks]], large cavities, geometric designs, tribal marks, and hand- and footprints.&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of rock carvings were discovered in Jebel Jassassiyeh, in northeast Qatar, in 1961. Variations in motifs and technique indicate that the carvings were made through various historical periods.&lt;ref name="nayeem8"&gt;Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Cup-marks are the most common forms of art among the nearly 900 carvings. Other carvings include ships, animals, foot-prints and tribal marks (known as ''wasum'').&lt;ref name="nayeem7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bibby|first=Geoffrey|title=Arabian Gulf archaeology|journal=Kuml|year=1965|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different animals are depicted, such as ostriches, turtles and fish. A large number of the carvings illustrate boats, and this is the only site in Qatar where boat depictions have been recorded. The boats are of different sizes and types, and some contain [[oar]]s while others do not.&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometrical designs were recorded at Freiha in four places. They measure 11 to 15&amp;nbsp;cm in width and 11 to 12&amp;nbsp;cm in height. Danish archaeologist [[Peter Glob]] believed that they were carved by an ancient fertility cult.&lt;ref name="256nayeem"&gt;Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glob|first=Peter|title=Prehistoric discoveries in Qatar|journal=Kuml|year=1957|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was disputed by Muhammad Abdul Nayeem, who believes that they are simply abstract symbols or tribal marks.&lt;ref name="256nayeem"/&gt;

==Textiles==

===Weaving and dyeing===
[[File:Fabric displays in Souq Waqif.jpg|thumb|Satin fabrics on display in [[Souq Waqif]]]]
[[Weaving]] and [[dyeing]] played a substantial role in [[Bedouin]] culture. The process of spinning sheep's and camel's wool to produce cloth was laborious. The wool was first disentangled and tied to a bobbin, which would serve as a core and keep the fibers rigid. This was followed by spinning the wool by hand on a spindle known as a ''noul''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; They were then placed on a vertical [[loom]] constructed from wood whereupon women would use a stick to beat the [[weft]] into place.&lt;ref name="abusaud136"&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting cloths were used in rugs, carpets and tents. Tents were usually made up of naturally colored cloth, whereas rugs and carpets used dyed cloth, mainly red and yellow.&lt;ref name="abusaud136"/&gt; The dyes were made from desert herbs, with simple geometrical designs being employed. The art lost popularity in the 19th century as dyes and cloth were increasingly imported from other regions in Asia.&lt;ref name="abusaud136"/&gt;

===Embroidery===
[[File:Embroidered dresses in Souq Waqif.jpg|thumb|left|Embroidered dresses on display in Souq Waqif]]
A simple form of embroidery practiced by Qatari women was known as ''[[Kurar (embroidery)|kurar]]''. It involved four women, each carrying four threads, who braided the threads on articles of clothing, mainly ''[[thawb]]s'' or ''[[abaya]]s''. The braids, varying in color, were sewn vertically. It was similar to heavy [[chain stitch]] embroidery.&lt;ref name="abusaud136"/&gt; Gold threads, known as ''[[zari]]'', were commonly used. They were usually imported from [[India]].&lt;ref name="abusaud137"&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of embroidery involved the designing of caps called ''[[Taqiyah (cap)|gohfiahs]]''. They were made from cotton and were pierced with thorns from palm-trees to allow the women to sew between the holes. This form of embroidery declined in popularity after the country began importing the caps.&lt;ref name="abusaud137"/&gt;

''Khiyat al madrasa'', translated as 'school embroidery', involved the stitching of furnishings by [[satin stitch]]ing. Prior to the stitching process, a shape was drawn onto the fabric by a skilled artist. The most common designs were birds and flowers.&lt;ref name="abusaud140"/&gt;

==Architecture==
{{See also|Category:Forts in Qatar}}
[[File:Ath Thaqab Fort.jpg|thumb|[[Ath Thaqab]] Fort]]
The numerous forts found throughout the Qatari peninsula are a testament to the country's ancient construction methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qm.org.qa/en/project/forts-qatar|title=Forts in Qatar|publisher=Qatar Museums|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most forts were constructed using mainly [[limestone]], with other constituents such as mud and clay brick also being used. A type of mixture consisting of mud and clay brick known locally as ''lubnah'' was sometimes used in the construction of forts, such as in [[Ar Rakiyat Fort]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Syriac Writers of Qatar in the Seventh Century'' (2014), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture in Doha===
Most traditional houses in the capital [[Doha]] were tightly packed and arranged around a central courtyard. A number of rooms were situated in the courtyard, most often including a ''[[majilis]]'', bathroom and store room. The houses were made from limestone quarried from local sources. Walls surrounding the compounds were made up of compressed mud, gravel and small stones. As they were heavily susceptible to natural erosion, they were protected by [[gypsum]] [[plaster]]. Mangrove poles wrapped in jute rope provided structural support for the windows and doors.&lt;ref name="originsofdoha"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://originsofdoha.wordpress.com/2015/02/15/traditional-domestic-architecture-of-qatar/|title=Traditional domestic architecture of Qatar|publisher=Origins of Doha|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Traditional Qatari houses in Al Wakrah.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional Qatari houses in [[Al Wakrah]] Heritage Village]]
Roofs were typically flat and were supported by mangrove poles. The poles were covered with a layer of split bamboo and a palm mat locally called ''manghrour''. The mangrove poles often extended past the exterior walls for decorative purposes. Doors were made of metal or wood. Colored glass employing geometrical designs was sometimes used in windows.&lt;ref name="originsofdoha"/&gt;

Several methods were used in traditional architecture to alleviate the harsh climate of the country. Windows were seldom used in order to reduce heat conduction.&lt;ref name="originsofdoha"/&gt; The ''badgheer'' construction method allowed air to be channeled into houses for ventilation purposes. This was accomplished by several methods, including horizontal air gaps in rooms and parapets, and vertical openings in wind towers called ''hawaya'' which drew air into the courtyards. Wind towers, however, were not as common in Doha as they were in other parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catnaps.org/islamic/gulfarch4.html|title=Gulf architecture|publisher=catnaps.org|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Qatar gained independence, many of the districts of old Doha, including [[Al Najada]], Al Asmakh and [[Al Hitmi|Old Al Hitmi]], faced gradual decline, and as a result much of their historical architecture has been demolished.&lt;ref name="bouassa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7412457/Al_Asmakh_historic_district_in_Doha_Qatar_from_an_urban_slum_to_living_heritage_PLEASE_SCROLL_DOWN_FOR_ARTICLE_Al_Asmakh_historic_district_in_Doha_Qatar_from_an_urban_slum_to_living_heritage|title=Al Asmakh historic district in Doha, Qatar: from an urban slum to living heritage|website=academia.edu|author=Djamel Bouassa|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of schemes have been taken to preserve the city's cultural and architectural heritage, such as the [[Qatar Museums Authority]]'s 'Al Turath al Hai' ('living heritage') initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marhaba.qa/the-winners-of-the-old-doha-prize-competition-announced/|title=The Winners of the Old Doha Prize Competition Announced|publisher=Marhaba|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern visual arts==
[[File:Art gallery in Souq Waqif.jpg|thumb|175px|Art gallery in Souq Waqif]]
Historically, paintings were not common in Qatari society. Instead, other art forms such as calligraphy and architecture were preferred.&lt;ref name="abusaud140"/&gt; After the oil boom in the mid-20th century, paintings gained popularity. Common themes during this period were related to Islamic and Arabic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art exhibition]]s were held under the auspices of the Ministry of Education until 1972.&lt;ref name="abusaud142"&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education integrated art education into the school system and allocated facilities for art workshops.&lt;ref name="jasra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aljasra.org/archive/cms/?p=324|title=رحلة الفن التشكيلي بدولة قطر أ.د. ليلي حسن علام|publisher=Aljasra Culture Magazine|date=16 June 2010|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an initiative to develop the local artist base, the ministry began offering scholarships to study art abroad. [[Jassim Zaini]] became the first Qatari art student to study abroad on a scholarship in 1962 after he enrolled in the [[University of Baghdad]]. Several more artists were sent abroad on art scholarships during the 1960s and 1970s, including [[Wafika Sultan Al-Essa|Wafika Sultan]], [[Hassan Al Mulla]] and [[Yousef Ahmad]]. The latter became the first artist to receive an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1981. Yousef Ahmad was the first artist to hold a [[solo exhibition]] in 1977. Under its director [[Nasser Al-Othman]], the Culture and Arts Department inaugurated the country's first art gallery in 1977–78.&lt;ref name="jasra"/&gt;

Yousef Ahmad, Hassan Al Mulla and Muhammad Ali established the country's first art group in 1977, "The Three Friends Group".&lt;ref name="jasra"/&gt; In 1980, the Qatari Fine Arts Society was established with the objective of promoting the works of Qatari artists.&lt;ref name="abusaud142"/&gt; That year, an art workshop was opened for women with the aim of providing them with an opportunity to hone their artistic skills.&lt;ref&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; The Qatari Fine Arts Society held their first exhibition in 1981.&lt;ref name="abusaud142"/&gt; In December 1982, the country's first art exhibition for females was held.&lt;ref name="jasra"/&gt;

[[File:Sheikh Hassan.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani|Hassan bin Mohammed Al Thani]] has featured prominently in Qatar's art scene since 1986]]
Five main art movements emerged in the country by the late 20th century: [[surrealism]], [[Realism (arts)|realism]], [[expressionism]], [[abstract art]], and [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref name="jasra"/&gt;

A member of the ruling family, [[Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani]], has been an instrumental figure in developing Qatar's modern art industry since the 1980s. Among his art-related activities was establishing his own museum which doubled as a residency space for Doha-based artists in 1994, and establishing the [[Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art]] in 2010 to which he donated his entire art collection, which he had begun assembling in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6swDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165|title=Art and the Global Economy|publisher=University of California Press|author=John Zarobell|page=165|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a quartet comprising Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt [[2017–18 Qatar diplomatic crisis|severed all ties]] with and imposed a blockade of Qatar on 5 June 2017, Qatari artist Ahmed Al-Maadheed created an illustration known as "Tamim Almajd", which translates to "Tamim the Glorious". A simple black and white sketch of Emir [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani]], beneath of which is the text "Tamim Almajd" in the style of [[Arabic calligraphy]], the illustration has become symbolic of Qatari nationalism. The image is now displayed prominently on buildings, in media and in art in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tamim-the-glorious-enthrals-qatar/article19421398.ece|title=‘Tamim the Glorious’ enthrals Qatar|publisher=The Hindu|agency=AFP|date=3 August 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, R.A., O.M. - Sappho and Alcaeus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px]]

'''''Sappho and Alcaeus''''' is an 1881 oil painting by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].  It is held by the [[Walters Art Museum]] in Baltimore.

The painting measures {{convert|66|x|122|cm}}.  It depicts a concert in the late 7th century BC, with the poet [[Alcaeus of Mytilene]] playing the [[kithara]].  In the audience is fellow [[Lesbos|Lesbian]] poet [[Sappho]], accompanied by several of her female friends.  Sappho is paying close attention to the performance, resting her arm on a cushion which bears a [[laurel wreath]], presumably intended for the performer. The painting illustrates a passage by the poet [[Hermesianax]], recorded by [[Athenaeus]] in his ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' ("The Philosophers' Banquet"), book 13, page 598.

The location, with tiers of white marble seating, is based on the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] in Athens, but Alma-Tadema has replaced the original inscribed names of Athenians with the names of Sappho's friends.  In the background, the Aegean Sea can be seen through some trees.

The painting was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1881, and depicted in [[William Powell Frith]]'s ''[[A Private View at the Royal Academy, 1881]]'', to the far right, being inspected by[[John Everett Millais]].   It was highly praised by critics: ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' described it as "marbellous".  It was acquired by [[William Thompson Walters]] of Baltimore, and on his death in 1894 it was inherited by his son [[Henry Walters]], who left it to the Walters Art Museum on his own death in 1931.

'''User expectations''' refers to the consistency that users expect from products.  [[Interaction design]] is very concerned with this topic.  For example, our user expectations for traffic behavior is one of the more consistent ones because it is governed by [[traffic law]]s that are enforced.  [[Software]], or even worse small [[consumer electronics]], on the other hand, can have widely varying degrees of consistency.

A good [[rule of thumb]] or ''design principle'' to use in interaction design is to follow the "[[Principle of least astonishment]]".  In the case of interactive [[software application]]s, for example,  users form expectations based on their experience with similar kinds of software. Effective [[software design]] aims to conform with prevailing norms for aspects of behavior such as the software's [[user interface]] and its [[responsiveness]].

A commonly noted sign of poor [[usability]] and [[human factors]] due to the violation of user expectations is when [[information sign|signs]] are needed for common things like doors.  This was made famous by [[Donald A. Norman]] in his seminal book [[The Psychology of Everyday Things]].  There is also a website devoted to such Bad Designs [http://baddesigns.com].

'''Visual focus depth art''' ('''VFDA''') is a form of [[mixed media]] [[collage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mixed-media|title=mixed-media|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that places an emphasis on the use of three-dimensional application to individual creations of single one-of-a-kind art pieces to emphasize individual meaning in the work. It is a derivative of ''[[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1992) "Assemblage Art". ''Glossary of Art, Architecture &amp; Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed. Retrieved February 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''collage''&lt;ref&gt;Collage, essay by Clement Greenberg, July 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[decollage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See D-De, ArtLex Art Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is similar to the basic mixed-media collage idea of building up various levels of the piece for emphasis. Known in this medium as '''''projections''''', the artist tries in a variety of ways to create a visual image that causes the viewer to focus on certain areas of the art framework that would ordinarily be overlooked or relegated to the background rather than to randomly layer structure creating a whole image of the work.

==Origins==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}While the exact origins of VFDA are unknown, the first artwork of its nature began to appear around 2010 in the street art of various cities in Europe, including [[Paris]], [[Brussels]] and [[Amsterdam]]. This appears to have been a response to the expanding use of computer generation in art to both design and create mixed-media collage works that could be essentially pre-designed and mass-produced. Since that time, various artists have produced series of works-known as '''''ensembles'''''—that are individually unique and limited in scope. Common themes of these ensembles range widely from ideological ideas like bohemianism, libertine and socially relevant matters to historical perspective, such as the interpretation of various time periods and eras.

==Structure of the design==
The floor/design base of the piece is used to create a theme or story about the subject.  Sections of the work are then raised to provide emphasis and act as an accent to substantiate the message. VFDA is usually created in single pieces or via limited series depending upon the artist involved and is also generally confined to canvass or wooden framework. Larger scale pieces, such as architectural interpretations, are generally not considered part of this medium. Each VFDA piece is unique is not duplicated in any way with the exception of limited prints. While some artists offer limited prints of the original artwork, the number offered is very limited in scope.

[[File:Femme Fatales VFDA.JPG|thumb|Femme Fatales VFDA]]

==Background variations==
The backgrounds used in VFDA range widely from the use of true vintage pieces such as original period sheet music, fractional currency, foreign money or other items that set the time frame for the piece.  Each of the items used relate the overall, theme of the art. The background can also be structured in segmented form-through the use of '''linear script'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/linear|title=Linear - Definition of linear by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;—composed of simply drawn lines with little attempt at pictorial representation, '''mathematic symbolism'''—such as the use of angles and formulas and via '''free-form application'''—concepts chosen by the artist to represent the underlying theme in the work.

[[File:Athena VFDA.JPG|thumb|Athena VFDA]]

VFDA is based on the unique aspect of every piece being created by the artist. Materials used to emphasize the projections include wooden palates measured to the frame, various forms of corkboard, balsa wood and other materials that are hand-cut or machined by the artist to help raise the projections to the level desired. The use of preformed shapes, three-dimensional printing and advanced computer generation of any kind&lt;ref&gt;Ruddick Bloom, Susan (2006). ''Digital Collage and Painting: Using Photoshop and Painter to Create Fine Art''. Focal Press. {{ISBN|0-240-80705-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; used to map the work or create the projections is not considered to be part of this art form because the work can be saved, duplicated and even mass-produced.&lt;ref&gt;Lev Manovich (2001) ''The Language of New Media'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vonnegut, Wright &amp; Yeager''' was an [[architectural firm]] active in mid-twentieth-century [[Indiana]]. The firm was organized in 1946 as a partnership between the surviving partners of three Indiana firms: [[Kurt Vonnegut Sr.]] (1884&amp;ndash;1957) of  [[Vonnegut &amp; Bohn|Vonnegut, Bohn &amp; Mueller Architects]]; [[George Caleb Wright]] (b. April 25, 1889) of [[Pierre &amp; Wright]]; and [[Ralph Oscar Yeager]] (b. August 16, 1892) of [[Miller &amp; Yeager]]. It was located at 1126 Hume Mansur Building, [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] and 402 Opera House Building, [[Terre Haute, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=AIAquestion&gt;"Questionnaire for Architects' Roster and/or Register of Architects Qualified for Federal Public Works [http://communities.aia.org/sites/hdoaa/wiki/AIA%20scans/Rosters/VonnegutWrightYeager_roster.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230155/http://communities.aia.org/sites/hdoaa/wiki/AIA%20scans/Rosters/VonnegutWrightYeager_roster.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }} June 13, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vonnegut, Wright &amp; Yeager was formed in 1946. In 1957, after the death of partner Kurt Vonnegut Sr., George Caleb Wright left the firm to become senior partner in the Indianapolis firm Wright, Porteus &amp; Lowe.

'''Z Space''' is a [[regional theater]] and performing arts company located in the Mission District of [[San Francisco, California]]. Z Space is one of the leading laboratories for developing new voices, new works, and new opportunities in the American theater. In addition to commissioning and producing its own works, Z Space also presents productions created by other organizations.  

It was founded in 1993 by David Dower, as the outgrowth of earlier theatrical productions staged by artists known as the Z Collective, and was known for a time as the Z Space Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wemette | first = Jonathan | title = Z Space 2011 | journal = Yale School of Drama: Management Case Study | volume = 11 | issue = 44 | pages = 2–3 | year = 2012 | url = http://yaletmknowledgebase.org/featured/case-study-z-space-2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Stein | first=Ruth | date=January 22, 1995 | title=Saving 'Grace': Z Space director David Dower molds new work for the Magic | periodical=San Francisco Chronicle | url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Saving-Grace-Z-Space-director-David-Dower-3048215.php}}/&lt;/ref&gt; Dower was succeeded in 2007 by Lisa Steindler, who currently serves as Z Space’s executive artistic director.

In its first 15 years, Z Space developed and produced artistic works that were staged in a variety of San Francisco Bay Area theaters. Throughout the 90s and early 00s, Z Space worked with such artists as [[Josh Kornbluth]], Anne Galjour, Randall Wong, and Brian Thorstensen. In 2009, Z Space moved into its own full-time facility in San Francisco’s Mission district, situated at 450 Florida Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Veltman | first = Chloe | work = ArtsJournalBlogs | title = A New Space for Z Space | date = August 12, 2009 | url=http://www.artsjournal.com/lies/2009/08/a_new_space_for_z_space}}/&lt;/ref&gt; The 13,000-square-foot facility  originally was constructed in the 1920s as a tooling factory for the American Can Company.&lt;ref name="Stich2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sidra Stich|title=Art-SITES San Francisco: the indispensable guide to contemporary art-architecture-design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIpPAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 October 2012|year=2003|publisher=Art-SITES Press|isbn=978-1-931874-01-4|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, the building was converted into military use, making airplane parts.&lt;ref name="felciano2002"&gt;{{Citation | last=Felciano | first=Rita | date=November 1, 2002 | title=Dark Days for Theater Artaud | periodical=Dance Magazine | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dark+days+for+Theater+Artaud.+(News).-a093084796}}/&lt;/ref&gt; The building's interior was transformed into the Project Artaud Theater in 1971.&lt;ref name="felciano2002" /&gt; In 2013, Z Space expanded into Z Below (formerly The Traveling Jewish Theater), an 86-seat complement to the 230-seat warehouse above. 

Z Space’s performances span a variety of disciplines, including theater, dance, visual art, music and performance art. Through its Z Space New Works program, the organization develops unique works from initial concept to on-stage production; it also provides technical residencies in which artists can make use of the entire facility, including the stage, lights and sound system to test and develop their concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wemette | first = Jonathan | title = Z Space 2011 | journal = Yale School of Drama: Management Case Study | volume = 11 | issue = 44 | year = 2012 | pages = 5–7 | url = http://yaletmknowledgebase.org/featured/case-study-z-space-2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Summer L. |url=http://www.howlround.com/interview-with-lisa-steindler-by-jamie-gahlon/ |title=Interview with Lisa Steindler by Jamie Gahlon |publisher=HowlRound |date=2012-05-16 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other signature programs at Z Space include Word for Word, an in-house theater company that transforms works of literature verbatim to the stage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Potter | first=Julie | title=Stories for big kids | newspaper=San Francisco Bay Guardian | date=March 9, 2011 | url=http://www.sfbg.com/pixel_vision/2011/03/09/stories-big-kids-tales-hit-stage-paul-flores-living-word-project-campo-santo}}/&lt;/ref&gt; and Youth Arts, Z Space's outreach to schools, which promotes literacy and engages students’ creativity. 

In 2013, Z Space received a three-year grant from Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to sponsor a resident playwright, Peter Sinn Nachtrieb. That grant was renewed in 2016, giving Peter a stable artistic home for another three years. Since Peter’s residency began, Z Space has produced three of his plays, ''The Totalitarians'' in 2014, ''A House Tour of the Infamous Porter Family Mansion with Tour Guide Weston Ludlow Londonderry'' in 2016, and ''The Making of a Great Moment'' in 2017.

Z Space has presented Bay Area premieres of internationally acclaimed performance ensembles [[The Wooster Group]] (2015), [[Elevator Repair Service]] (2014), [https://rudemechs.com/ Rude Mechs] (2015), and [http://www.theatermitu.org/ Theatre Mitu] (2015).

During the past decade, productions originating at Z Space have won national recognition including the [[Helen Hayes Award]] and the Kesselring Prize.  From 2001 through 2005, 15 productions developed by Z Space earned Critics Circle nominations. In 2005, ''The People’s Temple'' was awarded the [[Will Glickman]] Award for “Best New Play.” That work was developed during more than four years at Z Space; it premiered at the [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]]. In 2007, ''American $uicide'', by Mark Jackson, was nominated by the American Theatre Critics Association for the annual ATCA/Steinberg New Play Award, honoring new scripts produced outside New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zspace.org/history.htm |title=History |publisher=Z Space |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
