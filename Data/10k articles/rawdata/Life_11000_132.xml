In [[knot theory]], the '''7&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knot''', also known as the '''septoil knot''', the '''septafoil knot''', or the '''(7,&amp;nbsp;2)-torus knot''', is one of seven [[prime knot]]s with [[crossing number (knot theory)|crossing number]] seven.  It is the simplest [[torus knot]] after the [[trefoil knot|trefoil]] and [[cinquefoil knot|cinquefoil]].

The 7&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knot is [[invertible knot|invertible]] but not [[amphichiral knot|amphichiral]].  Its [[Alexander polynomial]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(t) = t^3 - t^2 + t - 1 + t^{-1} - t^{-2} + t^{-3}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

its [[Alexander–Conway polynomial|Conway polynomial]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla(z) = z^6 + 5z^4 + 6z^2 + 1, \, &lt;/math&gt;

and its [[Jones polynomial]] is

:&lt;math&gt;V(q) = q^{-3} + q^{-5} - q^{-6} + q^{-7} - q^{-8} + q^{-9} - q^{-10}. \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Knot Atlas|7_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, [[Abu'l-Fath Ali ibn Muhammad]], also called Ibn al-'Amid, succeeded him in his office.

== Biography ==
[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|right|260px|[[Iran]] in the mid-10th century]]
Abu 'l-Fadl was the son of [[al-'Amid]], a native of [[Qom, Iran|Qom]] from a low-class family, who served the various rulers of [[Tabaristan]], but was later taken captive by the [[Samanids]]. Abu 'l-Fadl is first mentioned in 940, when the Buyid ruler Rukn al-Dawla, who greatly favored him, appointed him as his vizier. In 948, Abu 'l-Fadl served as the tutor of Rukn al-Dawla's son [['Adud al-Dawla]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=230}} In ca. 955, a son of Abu 'l-Fadl's father's former overlord, [[Muhammad ibn Makan]], marched towards the domains of Rukn al-Dawla, conquering the important cities [[Isfahan]] and [[Ray, Iran|Ray]]. During their invasion, Abu 'l-Fadl tried to repel them, but was defeated. However, in a second battle, with the aid of Adud al-Dawla,{{sfn|Donohue|2003|pp=68-69}} he managed to rout them, reconquer lost territory, and capture their leader Muhammad. Another Dailamite military officer named [[Ruzbahan]] also shortly rebelled against Mu'izz al-Dawla, while his brother Bullaka rebelled against Adud al-Dawla at [[Shiraz]]. Abu 'l-Fadl, however, managed to suppress the rebellion. In the 960s, the prominent official [[Ibn Miskawayh]] served Abu 'l-Fadl as his chief librarian in an important library in Ray.{{sfn|Bosworth|2002}}

In 966, Abu 'l-Fadl was wounded during an invasion by ''[[ghazis]]'' from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], who plundered much of [[Jibal]], and marched towards the great library of Ray, which was, however, saved by Ibn Miskawayh.{{sfn|Bosworth|2002}} Rukn al-Dawla shortly managed to repel them.{{sfn|Zetterstéen|1987|p=360}} The next year, under the orders of Rukn al-Dawla, Abu 'l-Fadl conquered [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]], and restored the [[Sallarid]] [[Ibrahim I ibn Marzuban I]] as the ruler of the region, but shortly urged Rukn al-Dawla to depose Ibrahim and impose direct Buyid control on the region. Rukn al-Dawla, however, declined his advice.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=236}} In 970, Abu 'l-Fadl was sent on an expedition to the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] ruler [[Hasanwayh]], but died before he managed to deal with the latter, and was shortly succeeded as vizier by his son Abu'l-Fath,{{sfn|Bosworth|1975|p=269}} who shortly managed to deal with Hasanwayh.{{sfn|Zetterstéen|1987|p=360}}

== Work ==
Abu 'l-Fadl enjoyed an excellent reputation as a scholar and became the centre of a literary circle. Amongst his outstanding contributions to science is his book entitled "Building Cities" in which he describes building methods and [[construction]] planning. The book exists as an original [[manuscript]] in one of the Arabic and Islamic libraries in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].

'''Argumentation ethics''' is a proposed proof of the [[libertarian]] principle of [[self-ownership]] developed in 1988 by [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]], a Professor Emeritus with the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] College of Business and [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] Senior Fellow.&lt;ref name="hanshoppe"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoppe |first=Hans-Hermann |author2=Murray N. Rothbard|author3=David Friedman|author4=Leland Yeager|author5=David Gordon|author6=Douglas Rasmussen |title=Liberty Symposium |journal=Liberty |date=November 1988 |volume=2 |url=http://www.hanshoppe.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/liberty_symposium.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Responses have mainly come from Hoppe's colleagues at the Mises Institute, among whom the argument's reception has been mixed.&lt;ref name="blog.mises"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kinsella|first=Stephan|title=Revisiting Argumentation Ethics|url=http://archive.mises.org/9610/revisiting-argumentation-ethics/|work=Mises Economics Blog|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|authorlink=Stephan Kinsella|date=March 13, 2009|quote=[A] number of thinkers weighed in, including [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]], ... [[David Conway (academic)|Conway]], ... [[David D. Friedman|D. Friedman]], ... [[Tibor R. Machan|Machan]], ... [[Loren Lomasky|Lomasky]], ... [[Leland B. Yeager|Yeager]], ...[[Douglas B. Rasmussen|Rasmussen]], and others....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argumentation ethics aims to prove that arguing against [[self-ownership]] is logically incoherent. Hoppe states that if argumentation [[praxeology|praxeologically]] presupposes the norm that both the speaker and the listener are allowed to exercise exclusive control over their respective physical bodies in order to settle a disagreement or resolve a conflict over scarce resources, then it follows that propositions propounded during such argumentation cannot contradict this norm without falling into a ([[dialectical]]) [[performative contradiction]] between one's actions and words. Thus Hoppe concludes that despite aggressive behaviour being possible, it can not be argumentatively justified.&lt;ref name="hanshoppe2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoppe |first=Hans-Hermann  |title=The Ultimate Justification of Private Property |journal=Liberty |date=September 1988 |volume=1|page=20 |url=http://www.hanshoppe.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/hoppe_ult_just_liberty.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
Hoppe states that his theory is an [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]], [[Value judgment|value-free]] [[praxeology|praxeological]] argument for [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[ethics]].&lt;ref name="hanshoppe" /&gt; Argumentation ethics asserts the [[non-aggression principle]] is a [[presupposition]] of every argument and so cannot be logically denied during an argument. Argumentation ethics draws on ideas from [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s and [[Karl-Otto Apel]]'s [[discourse ethics]], from [[Ludwig von Mises|Misesian]] praxeology and from the [[political philosophy]] of [[Murray Rothbard]].

Hoppe first notes that when two parties are in conflict with one another they can, eventually, choose to resolve the conflict by one of two means. Engaging in violence, or engaging in honest argumentation. In the event that they choose argumentation, Hoppe asserts that the parties must have implicitly rejected violence as a way to resolve their conflict. That is, both participants agree that each one has to exercise exclusive control over their body parts in order to produce and perceive meaningful sentences. He therefore concludes that non-violence is one of the underlying norms ([[Grundnorm]]) of meaningful argumentation that is accepted by both participants.

Hoppe states that since because both parties act to propound propositions in the course of such argumentation, and because argumentation must presuppose certain norms (that he specifies, non-violence among them), then the content of the propositions cannot negate the presupposed propositions of argumentation. To do so is a [[performative contradiction]] between one's actions and one's words.&lt;ref name="hanshoppe2"/&gt;

==Deriving the non-aggression principle from the presuppositions of argumentation==
Argumentation ethics aims to show the non-aggression principle (in a certain formulation) follows from the presuppositions of argumentation, and so it cannot be denied.

Other than dismissing propositions calling for violence as means to resolve conflict, Hoppe also argues that only [[Universalizability|universal]] norms are consistent with such meaningful argumentation, as, he claims, arbitrary categorical distinctions have no intersubjective [[Theory of justification#Justifications and explanations|justification]], which also must be a presupposition of such argumentation. Hoppe then also argues that since argumentation requires the active use of one's body, all universal norms for resolving conflicts over the human body aside from [[self-ownership]] are inconsistent with argumentation, as they would not allow one to independently move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe7.html |title=Rothbardian Ethics |first=Hans-Hermann |last=Hoppe|date=20 May 2002 |publisher=[[LewRockwell.com]] |accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoppe then argues that since the resolution of conflicts over external resources must also be objectively justifiable, only the physical establishment of an objective link by original [[Appropriation (economics)|appropriation]] (i.e., [[homestead principle|homesteading]]) is a norm compatible with such a requirement. From these Hoppe concludes that only the non-aggression principle of self-ownership and [[John Locke|Lockean]] homesteading can be justified in an argument without contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanshoppe.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/hoppe_ult_just_liberty.pdf The Ultimate Justification of the Private Property Ethic]. Hans Hoppe&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishment and self-defense==
Bearing reference to the [[legal doctrine]] of [[estoppel]], [[Stephan Kinsella]]'s "Dialogical Estoppel" theory extends argumentation ethics by considering an argument between a victim and aggressor. Kinsella argues that an aggressor cannot consistently object to being proportionally punished for his act of aggression, by the victim or by the victim's representatives, because by committing aggression he commits himself to the proposition that the use of force is legitimate, and therefore, his withholding consent based on a normative right not to be physically harmed contradicts his aggressive legitimation of force, i.e. he is "estopped" from withholding consent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/12_1/12_1_3.pdf Punishment and Proportionality: The Estoppel Approach]. N.S. Kinsella&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses from colleagues==
Various responses to Hoppe's argument came from Mises Institute scholars.&lt;ref name="blog.mises" /&gt; Some of them accepted his argument, among them attorney [[Stephan Kinsella|Kinsella]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anti-state.com/article.php?article_id=312 |title=Defending Argumentation Ethics: Reply to Murphy &amp; Callahan |last=Kinsella |first=Stephan |date=19 September 2002 |publisher=Anti-State.com |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economists [[Walter Block]] and [[Murray Rothbard]],&lt;ref name=anarcho-lockean&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/daily/4629  |title=Beyond Is and Ought |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |date=November 1988|publisher=[[Mises.org]] |accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who called it "a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and for libertarianism in particular," adding "he has managed to transcend the famous is/ought, fact/value dichotomy that has plagued philosophy since the days of the Scholastics..."&lt;ref name=anarcho-lockean/&gt;

Mises Institute economists [[Robert P. Murphy|Bob Murphy]] and [[Gene Callahan (economist)|Gene Callahan]] rejected Hoppe's argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murphy |first1=Robert P. |last2=Callahan |first2=Gene |date=Spring 2006 |title=Hans-Hermann Hoppe's Argumentation Ethics: A Critique |journal=[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]] |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=53–6 |publisher= |doi= |url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/20_2/20_2_3.pdf |accessdate=9 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The late [[Austrian Economist]] David Osterfeld, an adjunct scholar at the Mises Institute, also rejected Hoppe's argument in an essay to which Hoppe subsequently responded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hanshoppe.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/osterfeld_hoppe.pdf |title=Comment on Hoppe / Comment on Osterfeld |last= |first= |year= 1988 |publisher=Austrian Economics Newsletter |accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Block has since defended the argument&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/system/tdf/22_1_31.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document&lt;/ref&gt; and Marian Eabrasu rebuts a wide range of criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;http://libertarianpapers.org/wp-content/uploads/article/2009/lp-1-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludwig Von Mises Institute Senior Fellow and Auburn University philosopher [[Roderick Long]] reconstructed the argument in [[Validity (logic)|deductively valid]] form, specifying four premises on whose truth the argument's soundness depends. Long goes on to argue that each premise is either uncertain, doubtful, or clearly false. He summarizes his views by stating:{{quote|I don’t think there's any reason to reject out of hand the kind of argument that Hoppe tries to give; on the contrary, the idea that there might be some deep connection between libertarian rights and the requirements of rational discourse is one I find attractive and eminently plausible. [...] But I am not convinced that the specific argument Hoppe gives us is successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Long|first=Roderick T.|authorlink=Roderick Long|title=The Hopperiori Argument|url=http://praxeology.net/unblog05-04.htm#10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A political theorist has concluded in a doctoral dissertation on the political philosophy of several Austrian economists that Hoppe has not provided any non-circular reasons why we "have to regard moral values as something that ''must'' be regarded as being established through (consensual) argument instead of 'mere' subjective preferences for situations turning out in certain ways". In other words, the theory relies on "the existence [of] certain intuitions, the acceptance of which cannot itself be the result of 'value-free' reasoning."&lt;ref&gt;J. Mikael Olsson, ''Austrian Economics as Political Philosophy'', Stockholm Studies in Politics 161, p. 157, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3945">A '''body broker''' (also '''non-transplant tissue banks''') is a firm or an individual that buys and sells [[cadaver]]s or [[human body]] parts.

Whereas the market for [[organ transplantation]] is heavily regulated in the United States, the use of cadaver parts for research, training, and other uses is not. Trade in these body parts is performed in a manner akin to [[raw material]]s, though many brokers say they charge fees as opposed to selling body parts.&lt;ref name="ReutersPart1"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-bodies-brokers/ In the U.S. market for human bodies, almost anyone can dissect and sell the dead], Reuters, Brian Grow and John Shiffman, 25 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas [[body snatching]] was a common way of acquiring bodies for research up until the 20th century, modern body brokers usually receive cadavers via [[body donation]].&lt;ref&gt;Garment, Ann, et al. "Let the dead teach the living: the rise of body bequeathal in 20th-century America." Academic Medicine 82.10 (2007): 1000-1005.&lt;/ref&gt; Body brokers often offer free [[cremation]] as a means to induce donation from families who are unable to pay [[funeral]] costs, returning ashes of part of the body to the next of kin.&lt;ref name="ReutersPart2"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-bodies-cody/ A Reuters journalist bought human body parts, then learned a donor's heart-wrenching story], Reuters, Brian Grow and John Shiffman, 25 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases body brokers obtain bodies [[fraud|fraudulently]] by stating use of the donation for research, subsequently reselling the body for profit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-bodybrokers-industry/ How the body of an Arizona great-grandmother ended up as part of a U.S. Army blast test], Reuters, John Shiffman, 23 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Body brokers also obtain cadavers and body parts from institutions who receive donations and have a surplus. In some cases, this is done illegally against the donor's wishes or by employees who act independently of the institution. In 2004, the UCLA Willed Body Program was suspended for a year after a scheme for the sale of body parts for profit involving its director at the time [[Henry Reid]] and body broker named Ernest Nelson was uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/07/AR2007030702124.html 2 Charged in UCLA Cadaver Scandal], Washington Post AP wire, Robert Jablon, 7 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/12/us/in-science-s-name-lucrative-trade-in-body-parts.html In Science's Name, Lucrative Trade in Body Parts], New York Times, SANDRA BLAKESLEE, JOHN M. BRODER, CHARLIE LEDUFF, ANDREW POLLACK and WRITTEN BY MR. BRODER, 12 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;. The scheme yielded some 1.5 million dollars in profits. Reid and Nelson were subsequently convicted for theft and related tax offenses and were sentenced to 4 and 10 years respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Cadaver-Body-Parts-Supplier-Gets-10-Years.html Human Body Parts Supplier Gets 10 Years], NBC LA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/15/local/me-willedbody15 Businessman found guilty in UCLA's willed body-parts program scandal], LA Times, Jack Leonard 15 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/18/local/me-willedbody18 Guilty plea in cadaver scheme at UCLA], LA Times, Victoria Kim, October 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5414">'''Capital punishment''' is forbidden in [[Switzerland]] by article 10, paragraph 1 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]]. [[Capital punishment]] was abolished from [[Swiss criminal law|federal criminal law]] in 1942, but remained available in military criminal law until 1992. The last actual executions in Switzerland took place during World War II.

==Use, abolition and reinstatement==
In the Middle Ages and Early Modern period, the most common method for execution, at least for males, was the [[decapitation]] with the [[sword]]. The archivist Gerold Meyer von Knonau has provided statistics for the canton of [[Zurich]] from the 15th century up to, and including the 18th century. 1445 persons were condemned to death (1198 men, 247 women). 915 of these were sentenced to be beheaded, 270 hanged, 130 burnt alive, 99 drowned, 26 [[Breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]], 1 quartered alive, 2 buried alive, 1 [[Immurement|immured]], and the last one was [[Impalement|impaled]]. The last three execution methods were in use in the 15th century, drowning was discontinued in 1613.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Knonau|first=Gerold Meyer|pages=334–335|url=https://books.google.com/books?jtp=335&amp;id=4xRMAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Der canton Zürich, historisch-geographisch-statistisch geschildert von den ältesten zeiten bis auf die gegenwart: Ein hand- und hausbuch für jedermann, Zweiter Band|year=1846|publisher=Bei Huber und compagnie|location=St.Gallen and Bern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, the [[guillotine]] was added, although many cantons allowed the person to be executed to choose between these two methods. One of the last people to be executed with a sword was [[Niklaus Emmenegger]] in [[Lucerne]] on 6 July 1867. Geneviève Guénat, the last woman to be executed, was beheaded by this method in [[Delsberg]], [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] on 7 September 1862, Héli Freymond in [[Vaud]] on 11 January 1868.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/eurofem.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848 the death penalty for [[political crime]]s was forbidden by the constitution. In 1874, with the [[Swiss constitutional referendum, 1874|introduction of the new federal constitution in 1874]], it was generally abolished throughout the country. However, because of an increase in crime - much due to the [[economic depression]] at the time - capital punishment [[Swiss referendums, 1879|was re-introduced in 1879]]. The revocation of the ban, however, was not obligatory and only a number of cantons chose to reinstate the penalty on the cantonal level.

==Abolition (1937-1942)==
On 21 December 1937 the [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland]] adopted the first national [[criminal code]]. It abolished capital punishment, which had been provided for by several cantonal criminal codes. The new code was ratified by [[Swiss referendums, 1938|referendum on 3 July, 1938]] and entered into force on 1 January 1942. The last person to be sentenced to death by a civil court and executed was [[Hans Vollenweider]], convicted of three [[murder]]s and then executed on 18 October 1940 in [[Sarnen]], [[Obwalden]]. Due to the impending abolition, Vollenweider's verdict - performed with a guillotine borrowed from [[Lucerne]] - was controversial.

Swiss [[military law]], however, still provided for the death penalty for [[treason]] and certain other military offenses such as desertion in the face of the enemy. During [[World War II]], 30 people were sentenced to death, and 17 of these were executed before the end of the war. This law was abolished by the Federal Assembly on 20 March 1992 after a parliamentary initiative by [[Massimo Pini]] of the [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland]]. The 1999 [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] then banned the death penalty at the constitutional level.

==Re-introduction initiatives==
Two [[initiative]]s have so far been launched to amend the Constitution to provide for the reintroduction of capital punishment. The first, in 1985, would have made [[drug dealing]] punishable by death. It did not manage to collect the required 100,000 signatures for a binding national referendum.&lt;ref name="swissinfo 24 August 2010"&gt;{{cite news|title=Death penalty initiative launched in Switzerland|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news_digest/Death_penalty_initiative_launched_in_Switzerland.html?cid=26355138|accessdate=24 August 2010|newspaper=[[swissinfo]]|date=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, family members of a murder victim launched another constitutional amendment initiative to provide for capital punishment in cases of murder combined with sexual violence.&lt;ref name="swissinfo 24 August 2010" /&gt; The initiative quickly found itself at the center of public attention and was roundly rejected by political leaders; it was withdrawn a day after its official publication.&lt;ref name="swissinfo 25 August 2010"&gt;{{cite news|title=Death penalty initiative is withdrawn|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/Death_penalty_initiative_is_withdrawn.html?cid=26670404|accessdate=25 August 2010|newspaper=[[swissinfo]]|date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="691">'''Chitting''' is a method of preparing [[potatoes]] or other [[tubers]] for planting.  The seed potatoes are placed in a tray (often in [[egg carton]]s) in a light and cool place.  All but three or four of the "eyes" (sprouting parts) of the potato are removed, leaving the strongest growths only.  After the sprouts are about {{convert|1|in|cm}} long, the seed potatoes are planted in the ground.

'''Clark Vandersall Poling''' (August 7, 1910&amp;nbsp;– February 3, 1943) was a [[Minister of religion|minister]] in the [[Reformed Church in America]] and a [[lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army]]. He was one of the [[Four Chaplains]] who gave their lives to save other [[soldier]]s during the sinking of the troop transport {{SS|Dorchester||2}} during [[World War II]].

==Life==
Poling was born in [[Columbus, Ohio]] to Dr. [[Daniel A. Poling|Daniel Alfred Poling]] (1884-1968), an Evangelical minister, and Susan Jane Vandersall (1882-1918). He was raised in [[Auburndale, Massachusetts]] where he attended Whitney Public School. He had three siblings, Daniel, Mary and Elizabeth. His mother died in 1918; his father remarried in 1919 and converted to the [[Baptist]] faith, becoming an ordained minister. The family moved to [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]] and Poling attended [[Oakwood Friends School|Oakwood School]] where he excelled on the football team.&lt;ref name="CVP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Clark V. Poling |publisher=The Four Chaplains Memorial Foundation |url=http://www.fourchaplains.org/poling.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201072418/http://www.fourchaplains.org/poling.html |archivedate=2013-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation he attended [[Hope College]] in [[Michigan]] and then [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]], graduating in 1933. He then attended [[Yale Divinity School]], graduating in 1936. He then took up a position as [[pastor]] of the First Reformed Church in [[Schenectady, New York]] where he settled with his wife Elizabeth Jung and their son Clark, Jr. ("Corky"). A daughter, Susan Elizabeth, was born three months after his death.&lt;ref name="CVP"/&gt;

At the outbreak of war in 1941, Poling immediately volunteered for service as an Army [[chaplain]] in the footsteps of his father, who had served as a chaplain during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="CVP"/&gt; He initially served in [[Mississippi]] with a transport regiment.

==Death==
[[File:Four Chaplains glass1.png|Four Chaplains|thumb|right]]
In late 1942, Poling was transferred to Camp Myles Standish in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]] and attended Chaplains School at [[Harvard University]]. There he met fellow chaplains [[George L. Fox]], [[Alexander D. Goode]] and [[John P. Washington]].
In January 1943, the chaplains embarked on board the ''Dorchester'', which was transporting over 900 soldiers to the [[United Kingdom]] via [[Greenland]].

On February 2, 1943 the German submarine [[German submarine U-223|''U-223'']] spotted the convoy on the move and closed with the ships, firing a torpedo which struck the ''Dorchester'' shortly after midnight. Hundreds of men packed the decks of the rapidly sinking ship and scrambled for the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. Several of the lifeboats had been damaged and the four chaplains began to organize frightened soldiers. They distributed [[Personal flotation device|life jackets]] from a locker; when the supply of life jackets ran out, each of the chaplains gave theirs to other soldiers. When the last lifeboats were away, the chaplains prayed with those unable to escape the sinking ship. 27 minutes after the torpedo struck, the ''Dorchester'' disappeared below the waves with 672 men still aboard. The last anyone saw of the four chaplains, they were standing on the deck, arms linked and praying together.&lt;ref name="S4C"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Saga of the Four Chaplains |publisher=The Four Chaplains Memorial Foundation |url=http://www.fourchaplains.org/story.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207070224/http://www.fourchaplains.org/story.html |archivedate=2008-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remembrance==
[[File:Four Chaplains stamp1.png|thumb|left|Four Chaplains stamp, 1948]]
The four chaplains were all awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and the [[Purple Heart]] and received national acclaim for their courage and self-sacrifice. A chapel in their honor was dedicated on February 3, 1951 by President [[Harry S. Truman]] at [[Grace Baptist Church of Philadelphia]]. The [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism|Four Chaplains' Medal]] was established by act of Congress on July 14, 1960, and was presented posthumously to their next of kin by Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker at Ft. Myer, Virginia on January 18, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Federal Military Medals and Decorations |publisher=Foxfall Medals |url=http://www.foxfall.com/fmc-fcm.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poling is honored with a [[feast day]] along with the other [[Four Chaplains]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] on February 3.

The high point of the town of Deering, NH, formerly known as Wolf Hill (1570&amp;nbsp;ft.), was renamed Clark Summit in Poling's honor, and a memorial plaque was placed at the summit outlook. "Located on what was once family land, Clark thought this was a peaceful place and would often go there to reflect on big decisions in his life. In fact, it was at Wolf Hill's summit that Clark decided to become a minister." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarksummitalpacas.com/about_us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6583">'''Creode''' or '''chreod''' is a [[neologism|neologistic]] [[portmanteau]] term coined by the English 20th century biologist [[C.H. Waddington]] to represent the developmental pathway followed by a [[cell (biology)|cell]] as it grows to form part of a specialized organ.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington,  pp 19–30&lt;/ref&gt;  Combining the Greek roots for "necessary" and "path," the term was inspired by the property of [[biology|regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 32&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[biology|development]] is disturbed by external forces, the embryo attempts to regulate its growth and differentiation by returning to its normal developmental trajectory.

==Developmental biology==

Waddington used the term along with [[canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]] and [[homeorhesis]], which describes a system that returns to a steady trajectory, in contrast to [[homeostasis]], which describes a system which returns to a steady state. Waddington explains development with the metaphor of a ball rolling down a hillside, where the hill's contours channel the ball in a particular direction. In the case of a pathway or creode which is deeply carved in the hillside, external disturbance is unlikely to prevent normal development. He notes that creodes tend to have steeper sides earlier in development, when external disturbance rarely suffices to alter the developmental trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 23&lt;/ref&gt; Small differences in placement atop the hill can lead to dramatically different results by the time the ball reaches the bottom. This represents the tendency of neighboring regions of the early embryo to develop into different organs with radically different structures.  Since intermediate structures rarely exist between organs, each ball that rolls down the hill is "[[canalisation (genetics)|canalised]]" to a region distinct from other regions, just as an eye, for instance, is distinct from an ear.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddington refers to the network of creodes carved into the hillside as an "[[epigenetic]] landscape," meaning that the formation of the body depends on not only its [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup but the different ways genes are expressed in different regions of the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, pp 30–33&lt;/ref&gt;  He expands his metaphor by describing the underside of the epigenetic landscape.  Here we see that the "landscape" is really more like a giant sheet that would blow away except that a series of tension-bearing cables holds it down.  The pegs that connect the cables to the ground are the genes.  The cables themselves are the epigenetic factors that influence gene expression in various regions of the embryo.  The depth and direction of the channels is thus determined by a combination of genetic makeup and the epigenetic [[feedback loops]] by which genes are regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, pp 34–37&lt;/ref&gt;

While Waddington does assert that the process of development is genetically driven, he makes no attempt to explain how this works and even offers evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 37&lt;/ref&gt;  He observes, for instance, that genes ordinarily determine peripheral traits, such as eye color, rather than "focal" traits, such as the structure of the eye itself.  Moreover, when genetic mutation influences basic structures, the result tends to be the complete transformation of a structure into another rather than piecemeal change, which Waddington illustrates with the developmental ball rolling out of one creode into another.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, pp 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus his account gives the impression that genes influence development, perhaps altering the course of a region of cells, without determining the endpoints toward which the embryo develops.

This interpretation is further reinforced by Waddington's discussion of the organization of the gene pool, where he points out that "the epigenetic process occurring during the development of the organism might be so buffered or canalized that the optimum end-result is produced irrespective of the genes which the individual contains."&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 120&lt;/ref&gt;  The more deeply creodes are carved into the epigenetic landscape, the weaker the influence of genes over development.  He also argues that deep creodes will resist not only genetic but environmental pressures to change course.  This phenomenon, which he calls "stabilizing selection," puts genes and environment on a par in secondary importance compared to the epigenetic system.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddington's emphasis on epigenetics over genes prefigured the current interest in [[evolutionary developmental biology]].  As [[Sean B. Carroll]] and others have explained, genes involved in development are roughly the same in all animal species, from insect to primate.  Instead of mutations in developmental genes, evolution has been driven by changes in gene expression, namely which genes are expressed at which times and locations in the developing organism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean B Carroll]], ''Endless Forms Most Beautiful'', WW Norton &amp; Company, 2005, pp 9, 64–71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

Architectural theorist [[Sanford Kwinter]] described the concept of the chreod as "the most important concept of the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;Sandford Kwinter, "Lecture Excerpt: What Is Life?," ''GSD 08 Platform,'' Harvard University Graduate School of Design, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "chreod" also closely describes paths of decision within what [[Christopher Alexander]] has called [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], his term for what he notes that Stuart Kaufmann calls "fitness landscape." By Alexander's theory, because conscious human design decisions do not need to follow these chreods, conscious human design can lead to mixed results. Therefore, he proposes that discovering ways to allow architecture to follow these paths is the best way to get good results in the built environment. Alexander sees his theories of "The Fundamental Process", "structure preserving transformations" and "15 fundamental properties" which he outlines in his work ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' as instrumentally shaping paths through configuration space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Alexander]], [http://www.katarxis3.com/SCIENTIFIC%20INTRODUCTION.pdf ''New Concepts in Complexity Theory Arising from Studies in the Field of Architecture''], p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Wayne Currie''' (1985 – 19 August 2005) was a 20-year-old apprentice in the building trades who was killed by a [[criminal rock throwing|stone deliberately thrown]] at his car as he drove along a motorway near [[Auckland]], New Zealand.&lt;ref name=Boyes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boyes|first1=Nicola|title='You're famous,' mates told teenage murder accused|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10389799|accessdate=21 April 2015|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=7 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His girlfriend and her two cousins who were in the car with him at the time of his death were injured but survived the assault.&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Martin|title=Detectives hunt Chris Currie's killer|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10341884|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=22 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macbrayne&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macbrayne|first1=Rosalene|title=Bridge victim's girlfriend still in shock|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10342039|accessdate=20 April 2015|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=23 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rock-throwing incident==
While Currie was driving a car along the [[Auckland Southern Motorway|Southern Motorway]] in [[Otahuhu, New Zealand|Otahuhu]] &lt;ref name=BinningE&gt;{{cite news|last1=Binning|first1=Elizabeth|title=High-profile detective calls it quits|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10458262|accessdate=20 April 2015|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=17 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was struck by an 8&amp;nbsp;kg block of concrete dropped from the Princess Street [[overbridge]]. Currie's girlfriend, Helen McCreadie, in the passenger seat, attempted to regain control of the car, but it crashed after 200 meters.&lt;ref name=Leask/&gt;

The stone block smashed through the windscreen of his car, struck his chin and then his chest. This fractured his [[sternum]], which severed his heart's main artery and instantly killed him. The car then travelled another 120 metres down the motorway before striking a pole, causing minor injuries to the other three occupants of the car. Shortly afterwards the youth was arrested and charged with murder and endangering transport and appeared in the Manakau [[District Courts of New Zealand|Youth Court]] on 23 August.

There were a spate of "copycat" rock-throwing attacks in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Currie.&lt;ref name=Auckland&gt;{{cite news|title=Rock-throwing 'brainless copycats' anger police|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10342525|accessdate=20 April 2015|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=26 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks [[Criminal rock throwing|thrown from highway overpasses]] is a recurring problem in New Zealand,&lt;ref name=Leask&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Rocks hurled from Auckland overbridge hit cars|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11156726|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Loren&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loren|first1=Anna|title=Stone's throw terror|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/manukau-courier/9617351/Stones-throw-terror|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=Manukau Courrier|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TVNZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=OtagoDT&gt;{{cite news|title=Rocks thrown from overbridge hit cars|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/281321/rocks-thrown-overbridge-hit-cars|accessdate=20 April 2015|publisher=Otago Daily Times|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are rural roadside attacks on vehicles by organized groups of rock-throwers,&lt;ref name=Wairarapa&gt;{{cite news|title=Truckie attacked by rock throwers|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wairarapa-times-age/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503414&amp;objectid=11434450|accessdate=20 April 2015|publisher=Wairarapa Times-Age|date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar attacks on trains.&lt;ref name=TVNZ&gt;{{cite news|title=All Too Common|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/606704/2683454.html|accessdate=20 April 2015|publisher=Television New Zealand|date=25 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==

The murder trial began on 3 July 2006 in the Auckland [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]].&lt;ref name=TVNZtrial&gt;{{cite news|title=Rock throwing murder trial underway|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/772798/423466/article.html|accessdate=21 April 2015|agency=RNZ|publisher=TVNZ|date=3 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rewiti had name suppression and was identified only as "R" during the trial. The suppression was lifted after the verdict. Rewiti plead not guilty to the murder charge but admitted Currie's [[manslaughter]]. Crown Prosecutor Aaron Perkins told the jury that Rewiti did not need to have intended to kill Currie to commit murder. Under the [[Crimes Act 1961]], death resulting from an unlawful act – in this case either an intention to cause him harm or to cause mayhem on the motorway – constitutes murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3720302a11,00.html |date=4 July 2006 |title=I didn't intend to kill – teen in concrete block case |accessdate=2006-07-05 |publisher=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |last=Diaz |first=Deborah }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Ecological psychology'''" is a term claimed by several [[schools of psychology]] with the main one involving the work of [[James J. Gibson]] and his associates, and another one the work of [[Roger Barker|Roger G. Barker]], Herb Wright and associates at the [[University of Kansas]] in Lawrence. Whereas Gibsonian psychology is always termed "ecological psychology", the work of Barker (and his followers) is also sometimes referred to as ''[[environmental psychology]]''. There is some overlap between the two schools, although the Gibsonian approach is more philosophical and deeply reflective on its predecessors in the history of psychology.

Both schools emphasise 'real world' studies of behaviour as opposed to the artificial environment of the [[laboratory]].

== Barker ==
Barker's work was based on his empirical work at the Midwest Field Station. He wrote later: "The Midwest Psychological Field Station was established to facilitate the study of human [[behavior]] and its [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] ''[[in situ]]'' by  bringing to [[psychological science]] the kind of opportunity long available to biologists: easy access to phenomena of the science unaltered by the selection and preparation that occur in laboratories." (Barker, 1968).  The study of environmental units ([[behavior settings]]) grew out of this research.  In his classic work "Ecological Psychology" (1968) he argued that human behaviour was radically [[situated cognition|situated]]: in other words, you couldn't make predictions about human behaviour unless you know what situation or context or environment the human in question was in. For example, there are certain behaviours appropriate to being in church, attending a lecture, working in a factory etc., and the behaviour of people in these environments is more similar than the behaviour of an individual person in different environments. He has since developed these theories in a number of books and articles.&lt;ref&gt;* Barker, R. G. (1968). Ecological psychology: Concepts and methods for studying the environment of human behavior.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gibson ==
[[James J. Gibson]], too, stressed the importance of the environment, in particular, the (direct) perception of how the environment of an [[organism]] ''affords'' various actions to the organism. Thus, an appropriate analysis of the environment was crucial for an explanation of perceptually guided behaviour. He argued that animals and humans stand in a '[[system]]s' or '[[ecological]]' relation to [[Environment (biophysical)|the environment]], such that to adequately explain some behaviour it was necessary to study the environment or niche in which the behaviour took place and, especially, the ''information'' that 'epistemically connects' the organism to the environment.

It is Gibson's emphasis that the ''foundation'' for perception is ambient, ecologically available information – as opposed to peripheral or internal sensations – that makes Gibson's perspective unique in perceptual science in particular and cognitive science in general.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J. (1966). The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems, Boston: Hughton Mifflin, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[aphorism]]: "Ask not what's inside your head, but what your head's inside of" captures that idea.&lt;ref&gt;Mace, W. M. (1977). James J. Gibson's strategy for perceiving: Ask not what's inside your head, but what your head's inside of. In R. E. Shaw &amp; J. Bransford (Eds.), Perceiving, acting, and knowing. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's theory of perception is ''information-based'' rather than sensation-based and to that extent, an analysis of the environment (in terms of affordances), and the concomitant specificational information that the organism detects about such affordances, is central to the ecological approach to perception. Throughout the 1970s and up until his death in 1979, Gibson increased his focus on the environment through development of the theory of [[affordance]]s - the real, ''perceivable'' opportunities for action in the environment, that are specified by ''ecological information''.

Gibson rejected outright [[indirect perception]], in favour of ''ecological realism'', his new form of [[direct perception]] that involves the new concept of ecological affordances. He also rejected the emerging [[Constructivist_epistemology|constructivist]], [[information processing]] and [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] views that assume and emphasize internal representation and the processing of meaningless, physical sensations ('inputs') in order to create meaningful, mental perceptions ('output'), all supported and implemented by a neurological basis (inside the head). 

His approach to perception has often been criticised and dismissed when compared to widely publicised advances made in the fields of neuroscience and visual perception by the [[Visual_perception#The_cognitive_and_computational_approaches|computational and cognitive approaches]].&lt;ref name=BruceEtAl&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Vicki Bruce|Bruce, V.]], Green, P. &amp; Georgeson, M. |title=Visual perception: Physiology, psychology and ecology |publisher=LEA |year=1996 | edition=3rd |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, developments in cognition studies which consider the role of [[embodied cognition]] and [[Enactivism (psychology)|action in psychology]] can be seen to support his basic position.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, A., (2008), Supersizing the Mind, Oxford, Oxford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, A. and D. Chalmers, (1998), "The Extended Mind." in Analysis, 58(1): 10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noë, A., Out of Our Heads (2009) and Action In Perception (MIT Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that Gibson's tenet was that "perception is based on information, not on sensations", his work and that of his contemporaries today can be seen as crucial for keeping prominent the primary question of ''what'' is perceived (i.e., affordances, via information) – before questions of mechanism and material implementation are considered. Together with a contemporary emphasis on dynamical systems theory and complexity theory as a necessary methodology for investigating the structure of ecological information, the Gibsonian approach has maintained its relevance and applicability to the larger field of cognitive science.

They were considered [[vengeful ghost|vengeful]] toward the living and might [[demon possession|possess]] people if they did not respect certain [[taboo]]s, such as the prohibition against eating [[ox]] meat.  They were thought to cause disease and inspire criminal behavior in the living, but could sometimes be appeased by funeral repasts or libations.  The edimmu were also thought to be completely or nearly incorporeal, "wind" spirits that sucked the life out of the susceptible and the sleeping (most commonly the young).

'''Elizabeth Bouvia''' (born c. 1958) is a figure in the [[Euthanasia|right-to-die]] movement.  Her case attracted nationwide attention in this area as well as in [[medical ethics]].

==History==
On September 3, 1983, Bouvia, at the age of 26, admitted herself into the [[Psychiatric hospital|psychiatric ward]] of [[Riverside County Regional Medical Center|Riverside General Hospital]] in [[Riverside, California]]. She was almost totally paralysed by [[cerebral palsy]] and had severe degenerative [[arthritis]], which caused her great [[pain]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonsen, Albert R., Ph.D. "Involuntary Treatment in Medicine", ''[[Annual Review of Medicine]]'', Volume 37, page 41, February, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouvia was alienated from her family and husband, and had been entertaining thoughts of [[suicide]]. She requested hospital authorities to allow her to starve to death.  When they refused and ordered her to be force-fed, Bouvia contacted the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], which assigned her a lawyer. In the subsequent lawsuit, the court upheld the hospital's decision and ordered [[force-feeding]] to continue (Pence 64-65).

==Appeal==
Following the court case, a bitter dispute broke out among [[physicians]] regarding the Bouvia case. Bouvia tried to resist the force-feeding by biting through the [[feeding tube]]. Four attendants would then hold her down while the tubing was inserted into her nose and liquids pumped into her stomach.

Some physicians called this [[battery (tort)|battery]] and [[torture]], while others claimed that the hospital was right to err on the side of continued life (Pence 65).

Bouvia appealed the [[lower court]] ruling and lost. Now, in addition to the force-feeding, she was hooked up to a morphine drip to ease the pain of her arthritis. Eventually, she appealed again and this time the court ruled in her favour that the force-feeding constituted battery (Pence 68).&lt;ref&gt;The case can be found at: 179 Cal.App.3d 1127, 225 Cal.Rptr. 297 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
After the court case, Bouvia decided that she would live. In 1998, she appeared on ''60 Minutes'', saying that she was still in pain and had felt great pressure to continue living; she expressed the hope that she would soon die of [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]]. She was still living in 2002.[http://www.sclhealthsystem.org/about/mission_vision/ethical_issues/elizabeth_bouvia.htm] In its obituary for USC professor Harlan Hahn, the ''Los Angeles Times'' on May 11, 2008, reported that Bouvia was still alive.

'''Ernest Michael McSorley''' (September 29, 1912 &amp;ndash; November 10, 1975) was the last captain of the ill-fated [[Lake freighter|Laker]]-type freighter ''[[SS Edmund Fitzgerald]]''. McSorley died along with the other 28 members of his crew when the ''Fitzgerald'' sank in [[Lake Superior]] on {{nowrap|November 10, 1975.&lt;ref name=tbl12dap&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AA9PAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6628%2C2566870 |work=Toledo Blade |location=(Ohio) |agency=Associated Press |title=Hopes fading for survival of lake freighter's crew |date=November 12, 1975 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssefo.com/features/faq/general.html |title=General Frequently Asked Questions

A [[Canadians|Canadian]] by birth, McSorley wanted to captain a boat. At age eleven in 1924, he moved to the [[United States]] with his father and stepmother and spent his teenage years in the [[St. Lawrence River]] town of [[Ogdensburg, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave |grid=21175 |name=Capt Ernest Michael McSorley |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A veteran mariner, McSorley had over 40 years experience on both the [[Great Lakes]] and oceans. He assumed command of the ''Fitzgerald'' at the start of the 1972 shipping season and had commanded nine ships before joining the crew of the ''Fitzgerald''.

A quiet man, McSorley was well respected by his contemporaries as a skillful master and by his men, whom he treated as professionals. McSorley had turned 63 a month and a half before the ''Fitzgerald'' incident and intended to retire at the end of the shipping season. Captain McSorley's last known words were, "We are holding our own." Despite his death in a storm, McSorley was respected throughout his career as a superb heavy weather captain.

McSorley resided in the [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] suburb of [[Ottawa Hills, Ohio]],&lt;ref name=tbl12dap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legacy.com/ns/news-story.aspx?t=the-wreck-of-the-edmund-fitzgerald&amp;id=157 |title=Legends &amp; Legacies: The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald |publisher=Legacy.com |date=1999–2014 |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was married to the former Nellie Pollock, an [[Illinois]] native. Although he had no children of his own, Nellie was the mother of three children from a previous marriage.  Nellie McSorley, who was in ill health at the time of her husband's death, survived for another seventeen years, dying at age 82 on February 13, 1993.

'''George Everett Strupper Jr.''' (July 26, 1896 – February 4, 1950), known variously as "Ev" or "Strup" or "Stroop" was an [[American football]] player. He played [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] for [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] from 1915 to 1917. Strupper overcame [[Hearing impairment|deafness]] resulting from a childhood illness and was selected as an [[All America|All-American]] in 1917.

During Strupper's three years playing for Georgia Tech, the team compiled a record of 24–0–2 and outscored its opponents by a combined score of 1,135 to 61. In Georgia Tech's record-setting [[1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game|222–0 win]] over [[Cumberland University|Cumberland College]] in 1916, Strupper scored eight [[touchdown]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. For many years, [[1917 Georgia Tech Golden Tornado football team|1917 Georgia Tech]] was considered the greatest football team the South ever produced. Strupper starred as part of a renowned [[Offensive backfield|backfield]] including also [[Joe Guyon]], [[Judy Harlan]], and [[Albert Hill (American football)|Al Hill]]. Strupper and teammate [[Walker Carpenter]] were the first players from the [[Deep South]] selected for an All-America first team.

Sportswriter [[Morgan Blake]] called Strupper "probably the greatest running half-back the South has known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/officialnational09nationa#page/n9/mode/2up |title=Spalding's Official Football Guide |author=Walter Camp |date=1919 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernie McCarty writes "Strupper ranks among the greatest broken-field gallopers in Southern football history. And he caught and threw [[Forward pass|passes]], [[Return specialist|returned kick]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Blocking (American football)|block]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ed well, [[Punt (gridiron football)|punted]] and played a bang-up [[Defense (American football)|defensive]] game."&lt;ref name=mcca/&gt; He was posthumously inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1972 and the [[Georgia Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1974.

==Early years==
Strupper was born in [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1896. His parents, G. Everett Strupper, Sr. (born 1872), and Bessie H. (Hatcher) Strupper (born 1875), were both Georgia natives.&lt;ref&gt;Census entry for G. Everett Strupper, Sr., and family.  Son G. Everett, born July 1896.

==Georgia Tech==
Strupper enrolled at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (Georgia Tech) in [[Atlanta]] in 1914. During his freshman year, Strupper became a member of the Georgia Phi chapter of the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] Fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia School of Technology "Blue Print," 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a multi-sport athlete competing for Georgia Tech in [[basketball]], [[American football|football]], and [[track and field]].&lt;ref name=GTAM/&gt;

In 1914, Strupper played for the freshman football team at Georgia Tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Class Football Starts at Tech|author=Hal Reynolds|newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution|date=December 13, 1914|page=3|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5264879/class_football_starts_at_tech/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then played [[Halfback (gridiron football)|halfback]] for Georgia Tech's varsity football teams under head coach [[John Heisman]] from [[1915 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|1915]] to [[1917 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|1917]]. Strupper was deaf, and because of his deafness, he called the signals instead of the team's [[quarterback]].&lt;ref name=Obit2 /&gt;  Strupper was a small man, with his height being stated in varying accounts to be between five-feet seven inches and five-feet, ten inches.&lt;ref name=Obit2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rank Southerner Above Many Brilliant Grid Men |publisher=Galveston Daily News |date=1917-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His coach John Heisman later wrote that Strupper was "but 5 feet 7 inches in height, weighed only 148&amp;nbsp;pounds stripped."&lt;ref name=Heis /&gt;  He was sometimes known as "little Everett Strupper."&lt;ref name=Obit2 /&gt;

Georgia Tech never lost a game in which Strupper played, compiling three consecutive undefeated seasons from 1915 to 1917.  During Strupper's three years playing for Georgia Tech, the team compiled a record of 24–0–2.&lt;ref name=CFHOF /&gt;  Only two teams managed a tie – the [[1915 Georgia Bulldogs football team|University of Georgia]] in 1915 and [[1916 Washington and Lee Generals football team|Washington &amp; Lee]] in 1916. In those 26 games, Georgia Tech outscored its opponents by a combined score of 1,135 to 61.&lt;ref name=CFHOF&gt;{{cite web |title=Everett "Strup" Strupper |publisher=College Football Hall of Fame |url={{College Football HoF/url|id=1281}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia Tech coach John Heisman later described Strupper as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Everett Strupper was a small package of condensed [[lightning]] when you turned him loose in an open field with a ball you wanted delivered somewhere in the neighborhood of the enemy's goal line. He was small, but he was put together like a high-powered [[motor]]. His arms and legs did just what his mind told them to do, and, believe me, his mind worked faster than [[Ty Cobb]]'s when he's running the bases. Dodging and twisting, [[Stiff-arm fend|stiff-arming]] and hipping, he'd run the gauntlet of men big enough, you'd think, to pick him up and spank him, and most of the time, too, he'd get away from them, try as hard as they would."&lt;ref name=Heis&gt;{{cite news |author=John Heisman |title=Heisman Tells Inside Story of Strupper's Play |publisher=Atlanta Constitution |date=1923-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Everett "Strup" Strupper (c. 1917).jpg|thumb|240px|right|Strupper from Georgia Tech archives]]
Heisman also said of Strupper "Were I compelled to risk my head on what one absolutely unaided gridster might accomplish, football under arm and facing eleven ferocious opponents, I would rather choose and chance this man on how he might come through the gauntlet than any ball carrier I have ever seen in action."&lt;ref name=GTAM&gt;{{cite news|title=Everett Strupper, Tech Immortal, Passes Suddenly|work=Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine, March–April 1950|year=1950|accessdate=May 15, 2016|url=http://issuu.com/gtalumni/docs/1950_28_4/19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heisman recalled that, when Strupper first arrived from [[Riverside Military Academy]], Heisman could not imagine Strupper playing on the football team: "Too light for the line, I didn't see how he could play in the backfield, because he wouldn't be able to get the signals. He could have played quarterback fine, but his enunciation wasn't clear enough for him to call the plays."&lt;ref name="Heis" /&gt;  Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame the obstacle posed by his deafness: "He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball."&lt;ref name="Heis" /&gt; He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869–1919 era team.&lt;ref name="allt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1242&amp;dat=19690731&amp;id=TkdTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YoYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2604,3160960|newspaper=Kingsport Post|title=U-T Greats On All-Time Southeast Team|date=July 31, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1915 season===
In his sophomore year, Strupper proved to be an all-around athlete. As Heisman told it, Strupper "was a star baseball player, a crack at basketball and the best sprint man we had in the school."&lt;ref name=Heis /&gt;  Heisman recalled that, despite his small stature, Strupper had a powerful body: "Stripped down in the dressing rooms Everett was a sight to behold. There never was a better set up lad than he; he was a regular [[Apollo]], beautifully muscled and built and coordinating rhythmically in every movement."&lt;ref name=Heis /&gt;

When Strupper tried out for the team, he noticed that the quarterback would shout the signals every time Strupper was to carry the ball. Realizing the loud signals would be a tip-off to the opposition, Strupper told Heisman, "Coach, those loud signals are absolutely unnecessary. You see when sickness in my kid days brought on this deafness my folks gave me the best instructors obtainable to teach me [[Lip reading|lip-reading]]."&lt;ref name=Heis /&gt;

Strupper first starred in a game against [[Transylvania Pioneers football|Transylvania]], scoring four touchdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4747949/the_atlanta_constitution/|work=The Atlanta Constitution|page=3|date=October 17, 1915|title=Yellow Jackets Win In A Romp|accessdate=March 27, 2016|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|author=[[Dick Jemison]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was injured the next week against [[1915 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], and blamed LSU's [[Phillip Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5156784/the_atlanta_constitution/|work=Atlanta Constitution|title=Jackets Win Over Louisiana 36 to 7; Strupper Injured|page=3|date=October 24, 1915|accessdate=May 4, 2016|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tech closed what was then the greatest season in its history with a 7–0 defeat of the [[1915 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn Plainsmen]].&lt;ref name=yellow&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4493917/the_atlanta_constitution/|work=Atlanta Constitution|page=9|date=November 26, 1915|title=Yellow Jackets Earn Tie To Football Championship By Defeating Plainsmen|author=[[Dick Jemison]]|accessdate=March 2, 2016|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; To begin the second quarter, Strupper had two key plays, the last of which was the game-deciding touchdown.&lt;ref name=yellow/&gt;&lt;ref name=siaa&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3278394/the_tennessean/|work=The Tennessean|title=Georgia Tech Claims S.I.A.A.

Next was the 19-yard touchdown. Strupper started around left end, then cut back into the center of the field, away from his blockers.&lt;ref name=yellow/&gt; He [[juke (football move)|juked]] and eluded "every man on the Auburn team." On the last move Strupper faked right and then dove left underneath the outstretched arms of [[Baby Taylor]] into the endzone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=T_OOVK2KJMedgwSXj4KQBg&amp;id=p1g4AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22babe+taylor%22+auburn&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22big+babe+taylor%22 |journal=The Volta Review |pages=102–105 |year=1925 |publisher=Volta Bureau |title=A Lip-Reading Football Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 1915 season, Strupper received two selections from a composite All-Southern eleven selected by ten sports writers and coaches, including those from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville]], Atlanta, [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper = Atlanta Constitution|title = Composite All-Southern Of Ten Of The Dopesters|author = [[Dick Jemison]]|date = November 30, 1915|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1924630//|accessdate=March 5, 2015|page=10|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1916 season===
[[File:Everett Strupper (October 1917).jpg|thumb|140px|Ev Strupper]]
In [[1916 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|1916]], Strupper had a 92-yard punt return for a touchdown on opening day against [[Mercer Bears football|Mercer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/71stats.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The next week, Strupper led Georgia Tech in a 222–0 victory over [[Cumberland Bulldogs football|Cumberland College]], "the most lopsided game in football history."&lt;ref name=CFHOF /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cumberland&gt;{{cite news |title=Remember When? Tech Won 222-0 Over Cumberland |publisher=Pacific Stars and Stripes (AP wire story) |date=1959-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The score (compiled on 32 touchdowns and 30 extra points) broke the old record of a 153–0 set by the [[Michigan Wolverines football|University of Michigan]] in 1912. Strupper scored eight touchdowns in the game, six rushing and two on punt returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Arnie Burdick |title=Touching lots of bases |publisher=Syracuse Herald Journal |date=1974-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One historic account of the 1916 Cumberland game described Strupper as the "lord high executioner":&lt;blockquote&gt;"There were many executioners that crisp early-fall Saturday. Halfback G.E. Strupper scored from 20 yards out on Tech's first offensive play and went on to be lord high executioner with eight touchdowns and a conversion for a total of 49 points."&lt;ref name=Cumberland /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the first quarter alone, Strupper scored four touchdowns on runs of 20, 10, 60, and 45 yards.&lt;ref name=Cumberland /&gt;  Strupper chose to allow others to share in the scoring. With a 42–0 lead midway through the first quarter, Strupper broke clear and could have scored easily, but he intentionally grounded the ball at the one-yard line to allow Georgia Tech tackle J. Cantey Alexander to score the first touchdown of his career.&lt;ref name=Beat&gt;{{cite news |author=Mercer Bailey |title=Tech Beat 222-0, in 1916 Game |publisher=The Ogden Standard-Examiner (AP wire story) |date=1956-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A teammate later recalled the play as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Strupper swapped positions with Alexander&amp;nbsp;... The team didn't want to make it too easy for Cantey, though. The other boys wouldn't  block for him or help in any way. As soon as the ball was [[Snap (gridiron football)|snapped]], they ran away from [[Lineman (gridiron football)|the line]] and out of the [[American football plays|play]] completely. Leaving poor Cantey to go it alone.

===1917 season===
Strupper also played on the 1917 team then considered the greatest the South ever produced, including one of the greatest backfields. According to the ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', "Strupper, [[Joe Guyon|Guyon]], [[Albert Hill (American football)|Hill]], and [[Judy Harlan|Harlan]] form a backfield with no superiors and few equals in football history".&lt;ref name=Back&gt;{{cite journal | last=McCarty | first=Bernie | title=Georgia Tech's 1917 backfield, better than the Four Horsemen: Part 2 | volume=1|number=4|date=May 1988|journal=College Football Historical Society Newsletter |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070443/http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv01/CFHSNv01n4h.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2016 | url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv01/CFHSNv01n4h.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tech gave Vanderbilt its worst loss in school history 83–0.

The ''Atlanta Journal'' wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Everett Strupper played like a veritable [[demon]]. At one time four Carlisle men pounced on him from all directions, and yet through some superhuman witchery he broke loose and dashed 10 yards further. On another occasion he attempted a wide [[end run]], found that he was completely blocked, then suddenly whirled and ran the other way, gaining something like 25 yards before he was downed."&lt;ref name=Back /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although there are competing stories as to the origin of the [[University of Alabama traditions#The Elephant|Red Elephant mascot]] for the [[University of Alabama]], some sources have cited a story written by Strupper about an October 1930 football game between Alabama and Mississippi.  Strupper wrote: "At the end of the quarter, the earth started to tremble, there was a distant rumble that continued to grow. Some excited fan in the stands bellowed, 'Hold your horses, the elephants are coming,' and out stamped this Alabama varsity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Al|publisher=University of Alabama|accessdate=May 15, 2016|url=http://www.rolltide.com/sports/c-cheer/spec-rel/big-al.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513023323/http://www.rolltide.com/sports/c-cheer/spec-rel/big-al.html|archivedate=May 13, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fascination with death''' has occurred throughout human history, characterized by obsessions with [[death]] and all things related to death and the [[afterlife]].

In past times, people would form cults around death and figures.  Famously, [[Anubis]], [[Osiris]], [[Hades]], and [[La Santa Muerte]] have all had large cult followings. La Santa Muerte (Saint Death), or the personification of death, is currently worshiped by many in [[Mexico]] and other countries in [[Central America]]. [[Day of the Dead]] (2 November), is a celebration for the dead.

==History==
The [[ancient Egyptians]] are most famous for their fascination of death by mummifying their dead and building exquisite tombs, like the [[pyramids of Giza]], for their dead.  Many of their deities were death-related, such as: [[Ammut]], the devourer of unworthy souls; Anubis, the guardian of the [[Necropolis]] and the keeper of poisons, medicines, and herbs; and Osiris, the king of the dead.

The [[Greek underworld]], [[Hades]], was ruled by the god Hades, and had five rivers that flowed through it. The rivers were: [[Acheron]], river of sadness; [[Cocytus]], river of lamentation; [[Lethe]], river of forgetfulness; [[Phlegethon]], river of fire; [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]], river of hate. The Underworld had attendants who, though not rulers, were important gods and beings. The [[Furies]] were female spirits who exacted vengeance against people who committed specific crimes. [[Keres (mythology)|Keres]] were female spirits of death and destruction.  [[Persephone]] was the goddess of the underworld and the spouse of Hades. [[Thanatos]], the god of death, was said to wear dark robes.

The [[Vikings]] believed that if a warrior died in battle, he would be taken to the Norse afterlife:  the hall of [[Valhalla|Valhöll]], in which the warriors would prepare for [[Ragnarok|Ragnarökk]], the battle at the end of the world.  [[Rune stones]] were erected to commemorate particularly brave warriors.  Death in one's sleep (a "straw death") was considered dishonorable.

===Modern Western culture===
In the early part of the 20th century, it was common to hold [[séance]]s at dinner parties. A séance is an event where a group of people (3 or more) try to communicate with the dead through one person of the group, known as a [[psychic medium]].

This fascination with death in Western Culture can be observed in many of [[Walt Disney]]'s fairytales. After being responsible for the death of an owl on his family's farm when he was 7 years old, he was haunted by the experience and other influences of death in his life, leading to a strong correlation with death in his children's stories.

Today there are a number of authors who have spoken on the fascination people have with death. "If it bleeds, it leads" is a phrase related to this, meaning that in the [[mass media]] most of the material is based on death.  For example: death and crime are almost always a topic in the news. The [[Goth subculture|goth]] and [[Metal subculture|metal]] subcultures are often associated with death and dying.

[[Daniel Kahneman]] and others have studied the psychology behind this.  For example, people buy insurance and make other decisions based on what comes readily to mind—e.g., the previously recorded high-water mark for a flood, rarely considering that something worse is possible and in many cases eventually likely.  This interacts with the management policies of media outlets to create [[availability cascade]]s and [[Media feeding frenzy|media feeding frenzies]]:  For example, "[[stroke]]s cause almost twice as many deaths as all accidents combined, but 80% of respondents [in a survey] judged accidental death to be more likely. ... [This is because media] coverage is itself biased toward novelty and poignancy.  The media do not just shape what the public is interested in, but also are shaped by it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

This fascination with death and interaction with media editorial policies sometimes has problematic consequences for public policy.  For example, Vincent Sacco&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The human psychology behind "If it bleeds, it leads" meant they could retain or even increase their audience while reducing the cost of producing the news:  [[Investigative journalism]] is enormously expensive, especially if it offends a major advertiser.  Focusing on crimes apparently committed by people without substantive political or economic power is cheap.  The resulting increase in crime stories convinced the US electorate that crime was out of control.  This led to the election of politicians who would "get tough on crime."  The result was a five-fold increase in the [[United States incarceration rate]] not justified by any actual increase in crime.

==Necrophilia==
'[[Necrophilia]]' is generally used in English to refer to the [[paraphilia]] associated with dead bodies, although the term has been used in a broader sense and in foreign language merely to refer to 'a fascination with death.'

==Military service==
Gander, initially a family pet [[pet naming|named]] Pal, accidentally scratched a child's face with his paw. Worried that he would be forced to have Pal put down, the original owner gave the large dog to [[The Royal Rifles of Canada]], a [[regiment]] of the [[Canadian Army]] stationed at [[Gander International Airport]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. The soldiers quickly renamed him Gander and "promoted" him to sergeant. When the unit was shipped to [[Hong Kong]] in the fall of 1941, Gander went along.

The [[Battle of Hong Kong]] began on December 8, 1941, the day after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Gander helped fight the Japanese invaders on three occasions. The last time, Gander picked up a thrown Japanese [[hand grenade]] and rushed with it toward the enemy, dying in the ensuing explosion, but saving the lives of several wounded Canadian soldiers.&lt;ref name=WFP&gt;{{cite news |title=Heroic warrior canine's name put on memorial |author=Bruce Ward |newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date=August 15, 2009 |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/heroic-warrior-canines-name-put-on-memorial-53287192.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After efforts by the [[Canadian War Museum]], the Hong Kong Veterans Association, and the Hong Kong Veterans Commemorative Association, the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]] awarded Gander the Dickin Medal on October 27, 2000, the first such award since 1949. The Dickin Medal is often referred to as the animal metaphorical equivalent of the [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=David|title=The animals' VC: for gallantry and devotion: the PDSA Dickin Medal - inspiring stories of bravery and courage|date=2012|publisher=Preface|location=London|isbn=9781848093768|ref=long2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The citation reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For saving the lives of Canadian infantrymen during the Battle of Lye Mun on Hong Kong Island in December 1941. On three documented occasions, Gander, the Newfoundland mascot of The Royal Rifles of Canada, engaged the enemy as his regiment joined The Winnipeg Grenadiers, members of Battalion Headquarters "C" Force and other Commonwealth troops in their courageous defence of the island. Twice Gander's attacks halted the enemy's advance and protected groups of wounded soldiers. In a final act of bravery, the war dog was killed in action gathering a grenade. Without Gander's intervention, many more lives would have been lost in the assault.&lt;ref name=pdsadog/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Honours==
At the insistence of survivors of the battle, his name was listed with those of 1975 men and two women on the Hong Kong Veterans Memorial Wall in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref name=WFP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Robin. ''Sergeant Gander A Canadian Hero''. Dundern Press. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS ''Ardent''''' was a [[Royal Navy]] 64-gun [[third rate]]. This [[ship of the line]] was launched on 21 December 1782 at [[Bursledon]], [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="Lavery, SoLv1 p181" /&gt; She disappeared in 1794, believed lost to a fire and explosion.

==Career==

In 1784 she was under the command of Captain Harry Harmood, serving as a guard ship at Portsmouth.

In 1793 she was under the command of Captain Robert Manners Sutton, sailing with Vice-Admiral Lord [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Hood]] at Toulon in August. She was part of a force detached under [[Robert Linzee]] to take part in the attack on [[Corsica]] in September.

==Fate==

In April 1794 ''Ardent'' was stationed off the harbour of [[Villefranche-sur-Mer|Villa Franca]], to watch two French frigates.&lt;ref name=Gossett&gt;Gossett *1986), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It is presumed that she caught fire and blew up. [[HMS Berwick (1775)|''Berwick'']] encountered some wreckage while cruising in the [[Gulf of Genoa]] in the summer that suggested fire and an explosion.&lt;ref name=Hepper&gt;Hepper (1994), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; A part of ''Ardent's'' quarter deck with some gunlocks deeply embedded in it was found floating in the area, as was splinter netting driven into planking.&lt;ref name=Hepper/&gt;  No trace was ever found of her crew of 500.&lt;ref name=Gossett/&gt;

'''Iran Air Flight 655''' was a scheduled passenger flight from [[Tehran]] to [[Dubai]], via [[Bandar Abbas]], that was shot down on 3 July 1988 by an [[SM-2MR]] [[surface-to-air missile]] fired from {{USS|Vincennes|CG-49|6}}, a [[Cruiser#US cruiser development|guided missile cruiser]] of the [[United States Navy]]. The aircraft, an [[Airbus A300]], was destroyed and all 290 people on board, including 66 children, were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy J. Cook, ''Stories of Modern Technology Failures and Cognitive Engineering Successes'', CRC Press, 2007, PP77.&lt;/ref&gt; The jet was hit while flying over [[Iran]]'s [[territorial waters]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], along the flight's usual route, shortly after departing [[Bandar Abbas International Airport]], the flight's stopover location. ''Vincennes'' had entered Iranian territory after one of its helicopters drew warning fire from Iranian speedboats operating within Iranian territorial limits.&lt;ref name=kelley-0706/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1993-08/vincennes-case-study |title=USS Vincennes: A Case Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the shootdown has been disputed between the governments of the two countries. According to the United States government, the crew of USS ''Vincennes'' had incorrectly identified the Airbus as an attacking [[F-14 Tomcat]], a U.S.-made [[jet fighter]] that had been part of the [[Iranian Air Force]] inventory since the 1970s. While the F-14s had been supplied to Iran in an air-to-air configuration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Limits to an F-14 Threat Cited by Military Aides|first=Richard|last=Halloran|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 July 1988|location=New York|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/07/world/limits-to-an-f-14-threat-cited-by-military-aides.html|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Corruptions of Empire: Life Studies &amp; the Reagan Era|first=Alexander|last=Cockburn|page=517|year=1988|publisher=Verso Books|location=London|isbn=9780860919407}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crew of the guided missile cruiser had been briefed that the Iranian F-14s were equipped with [[air-to-ground]] ordnance.&lt;ref name=Fogarty/&gt; ''Vincennes'' had made ten attempts to contact the aircraft on both military and civilian radio frequencies, but had received no response.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] said that the flight crew should have been monitoring the civilian frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/12/08/UN-agency-issues-report-on-downing-of-Iran-Air-jet/6458597560400/|title=U.N. agency issues report on downing of Iran Air jet|publisher=UPI|quote=[The ICAO] added the crew was supposed to listen to a second frequency, 121.5 megahertz, on which four warning were issued.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Iranian government, the cruiser negligently shot down the aircraft, which was transmitting [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|squawks]] in Mode III, a signal that identified it as a civilian aircraft, and not Mode II as used by Iranian military aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shooting Down Iran Air Flight 655 [IR655]|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/shootingdown_iranair_flight655.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/malaysian-airlines-commercial-shot-down2014-7 Shot Down Malaysian Airlines Flight Joins Few Others. – Business Insider&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The event generated a great deal of criticism of the United States. Some analysts blamed the captain of ''Vincennes'', [[William C. Rogers III]], for overly-aggressive behavior in a tense and dangerous environment.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blunders"/&gt;

In 1996, the governments of the United States and Iran reached a settlement at the [[International Court of Justice]] which included the statement "...the United States recognized the aerial incident of 3 July 1988 as a terrible human tragedy and expressed deep regret over the loss of lives caused by the incident..."&lt;ref name="ICJ-settlement-agreement"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/79/11131.pdf|format=PDF|title=Aerial Incident of 3 July 1988 (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

==Background==
[[File:USS Vincennes returns to San Diego Oct 1988.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|{{USS|Vincennes|CG-49|6}} had been deployed to the Persian Gulf at short notice to compensate for the lack of [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] cover]]
In 1984, the [[Iran–Iraq War#1984: 'Tanker War' in Persian Gulf|war between Iraq and Iran had expanded]] to include air attacks against oil tankers and merchant shipping of neighboring countries, some of whom were providing aid to Iraq by shipping Iraqi oil. The Flight 655 incident occurred a year after the [[Iraqi Air Force]] attack on the U.S. Navy guided-missile [[frigate]] {{USS|Stark|FFG-31|6}} on 17 May 1987, which killed 37 American sailors. U.S. naval forces had also exchanged gunfire with Iranian gunboats in late 1987, and the U.S. Navy guided-missile frigate {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58|6}} had struck an Iranian [[sea mine]] in April 1988. Two months before the incident, the U.S. had engaged in [[Operation Praying Mantis]], resulting in the sinking of the [[Iranian frigate Sahand|Iranian frigate ''Sahand'']]. Tensions were therefore high in the [[Strait of Hormuz]] at the time of the incident with Flight 655.

In response to the pattern of attacks on shipping, the U.S. [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] issued a [[NOTAM]] on 8 September 1987 warning all Persian Gulf countries that civilian aircraft must monitor the 121.5&amp;nbsp;MHz VHF [[Aircraft emergency frequency|International Air Distress]] or the 243.0&amp;nbsp;MHz UHF Military Air Distress frequencies and be prepared to identify themselves to U.S. Navy ships and state their intentions.&lt;ref&gt;http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA203577&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 1988, the U.S. expanded the scope of its navy's protection to all friendly neutral shipping in the [[Persian Gulf]] outside declared exclusion zones, which set the stage for the shootdown.&lt;ref name=kelley-0706&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/kelley07.pdf |format=PDF |title=Better Lucky Than Good: Operation Earnest Will as Gunboat Diplomacy |author=Stephen Andrew Kelley |date=June 2007 |publisher=[[Naval Postgraduate School]] |oclc=156993037 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823062402/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/kelley07.pdf |archivedate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}} {{USS|Vincennes|CG-49|6}} was rushed to the area on a short-notice deployment, as a result of high-level decisions, to compensate for the lack of [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] coverage, which was hampering U.S. monitoring of the southern Persian Gulf. ''Vincennes'', fitted with the then-new [[Aegis Combat System]] and under the command of Captain [[William C. Rogers III]],&lt;ref name=kelley-0706/&gt; departed [[Naval Base San Diego|San Diego]] on 25 April 1988 and arrived in [[Bahrain]] on 29 May 1988.

As the Strait of Hormuz at its narrowest is {{convert|21|nmi|km}} wide,&lt;ref name=USEIA01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/regions-topics.cfm?fips=WOTC#hormuz |title=Strait of Hormuz |date=30 December 2011 |work=World Oil Transit Chokepoints |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |accessdate=14 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110212439/http://www.eia.gov/countries/regions-topics.cfm?fips=WOTC |archivedate=10 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to traverse the strait, ships must stay within sea lanes that pass through the [[territorial waters]] of Iran and [[Oman]] under the [[transit passage]] provisions of customary [[Law of the Sea]].&lt;ref name=UNCLOS-historic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Strait_of_Hormuz |title=The Encyclopedia of Earth |publisher=National Council for Science and Environment |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304224334/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Strait_of_Hormuz |archivedate=4 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore normal for ships, including warships, entering or leaving the Persian Gulf to transit Iranian territorial waters. During the [[Iran–Iraq War]] the Iranian forces frequently boarded and inspected neutral cargo ships in the Strait of Hormuz in search of [[contraband]] destined for Iraq. While legal under international law, these inspections added to the tensions in the area.&lt;ref name=kelley-0706/&gt;

The plane, an [[Airbus A300]] ([[Aircraft registration|registered as]] {{Airreg|EP|IBU}}), flown by 37-year-old Captain Mohsen Rezaian, a veteran pilot with 7,000 hours of flight time, left Bandar Abbas at 10:17&amp;nbsp;[[Iran Standard Time|Iran time]] ([[UTC]]+03:30), 27 minutes after its scheduled departure time. It should have been a 28-minute flight. After takeoff, it was directed by the [[Bandar Abbas]] tower to turn on its [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponder]] and proceed over the [[Persian Gulf]]. The flight was assigned routinely to commercial [[air corridor]] Amber 59, a 20-mile (32&amp;nbsp;km)-wide lane on a direct line to Dubai airport. The short distance made for a simple flight pattern: climb to {{convert|14000|ft|m}}, cruise, and descend into [[Dubai]]. The airliner was transmitting the correct transponder [[Transponder code|"squawk" code]] typical of a civilian aircraft and maintained radio contact in English with appropriate air traffic control facilities.

On the morning of 3 July, USS ''Vincennes'' was passing through the [[Strait of Hormuz]] returning from an escort duty.&lt;ref name=kelley-0706 /&gt; A helicopter deployed from the cruiser reportedly received small arms fire from Iranian patrol vessels as it observed from high altitude. ''Vincennes'' moved to engage the Iranian vessels, in the course of which they all violated Omani waters and left after being challenged and ordered to leave by a [[Royal Navy of Oman]] warship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/archives/2000a_Monday17April2000.htm|title=The Other Lockerbie|date=17 April 2000|work=BBC News|accessdate=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vincennes'' then pursued the Iranian [[gunboat]]s, entering Iranian [[territorial waters]] to open fire. {{USS|Sides|FFG-14|6}} and {{USS|Elmer Montgomery|FF-1082|6}} were nearby. Thus, ''Vincennes'' was in Iranian territorial waters at the time of the incident, as admitted by the U.S. government in legal briefs and publicly by [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], Admiral [[William J.

Contrary to the accounts of various ''Vincennes'' crew members, the cruiser's Aegis Combat System recorded that the airliner was climbing at the time and its radio transmitter was [[Transponder (aeronautics)|squawking]] on only the Mode III civilian frequency, and not on the military Mode II.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/18/opinion/witness-to-iran-flight-655.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Witness to Iran Flight 655 |work=New York Times|date=18 November 1988 |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving no response to multiple radio challenges, and believing the airliner was an Iranian F-14 Tomcat (capable of carrying unguided bombs since 1985&lt;ref&gt;https://warisboring.com/in-the-1980s-iran-outfitted-f-14s-as-heavy-bombers/&lt;/ref&gt;) diving into an attack profile, ''Vincennes'' fired two [[RIM-66 Standard|SM-2MR]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s, one of which hit the airliner.&lt;ref name=WP1800-07-04 /&gt; The plane disintegrated immediately and crashed into the water soon after.

===U.S. government accounts===

According to the U.S. government, USS ''Vincennes'' mistakenly identified the airliner as an attacking military fighter and misidentified its flight profile as being similar to that of an [[F-14A Tomcat]] during an attack run; however, the cruiser's Aegis Combat System recorded the plane's flight plan as climbing (not descending as in an attack run) at the time of the incident.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The flight had originated at [[Bandar Abbas]], which served as both a base for Iranian F-14 operations and as a hub for commercial civilian flights.&lt;ref name="blunders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&amp;content_type_id=1271&amp;display_order=3&amp;mini_id=1278 |title=Military Blunders – Iran Air Shot Down – 3 July 1988 |accessdate=18 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518142130/http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&amp;content_type_id=1271&amp;display_order=3&amp;mini_id=1278 |archivedate=18 May 2007}} History.com&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same reports, ''Vincennes'' unsuccessfully tried to contact the approaching aircraft, seven times on the military [[Aircraft emergency frequency|emergency frequency]] and three times on the civilian emergency frequency, but never on [[air traffic control]] frequencies. This civilian aircraft was not equipped to pick up military frequencies and the messages on the civilian emergency channel could have been directed at any aircraft. More confusion arose as the hailed speed was the [[ground speed]], while the pilot's instruments displayed [[airspeed]], a {{convert|50|kn|km/h|adj=on}} difference.&lt;ref name="channel.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/videos/mistaken-identity/|title=Air Emergency, Mistaken Identity, National Geographic Channel| accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew of ''Vincennes'' realized only after the attack that the plane was a civilian airliner.

This version was finalized in a report by Admiral William Fogarty, entitled ''Formal Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Downing of Iran Air Flight 655 on 3 July 1988'' (the "Fogarty report") &lt;ref name="Fogarty"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA203577 |title=Formal Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Downing of Iran Air Flight 655 on July 3, 198 |first=William M. |last=Fogarty |date=28 July 1988 |id=DTIC AD-A203 577 |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only parts of this report have been released (part I in 1988 and part II in 1993). The Fogarty report stated, "The data from USS ''Vincennes'' tapes, information from USS ''Sides'' and reliable intelligence information, corroborate the fact that [Iran Air Flight 655] was on a normal commercial air flight plan profile, in the assigned airway, squawking Mode III 6760, on a continuous ascent in altitude from take-off at Bandar Abbas to shoot-down".

The Fogarty report also stated, "Iran must share the responsibility for the tragedy by hazarding one of their civilian airliners by allowing it to fly a relatively low altitude air route in Close proximity to hostilities that had been ongoing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Formal Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Downing of Iran Air Flight 655 on 3 July 1988 |url=https://archive.org/stream/FormalInvestigationintotheCircumstancesSurroundingtheDowningofIranAirFlight655on3July1988/Formal+Investigation+into+the+Circumstances+Surrounding+the+Downing+of+Iran+Air+Flight+655+on+3+July+1988_djvu.txt |publisher=United States Secretary of Defense }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When questioned in a 2000 [[BBC]] documentary, the U.S. government stated in a written answer that they believed the incident may have been caused by a simultaneous psychological condition amongst the eighteen bridge crew of ''Vincennes'', called "scenario fulfillment", which is said to occur when persons are under pressure. In such a situation, the men will carry out a training scenario, believing it to be reality while ignoring sensory information that contradicts the scenario. In the case of this incident, the scenario was an attack by a lone military aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Lockerbie'', BBC, 17 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iranian government account===
According to the Iranian government, the shootdown was an intentionally performed and unlawful act. Even if there was a mistaken identification, which Iran never accepted, it argues that this constituted negligence and recklessness amounting to an international crime, not an accident.&lt;ref name=ICJ-Aerial-Incident-IV.B&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/79/6629.pdf |title=Aerial Incident of 3 July 1988 (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

In particular, Iran expressed skepticism about claims of misidentification, noting that the cruiser's advanced Aegis radar correctly tracked the flight and its Mode III beacon; two other U.S. warships in the area, ''Sides'' and ''Montgomery,'' also identified the aircraft as civilian; and the flight was well within a recognized international air corridor. It also noted that the crew of ''Vincennes'' were trained to handle simultaneous attacks by hundreds of enemy aircraft.&lt;ref name=ICJ-Aerial-Incident-IV.B /&gt;{{rp|at=§4.50}} Iran finds it more plausible that ''Vincennes'' "hankered for an opportunity to show its stuff".&lt;ref name=ICJ-Aerial-Incident-IV.B /&gt;{{rp|at=§4.52}}

According to Iran, the U.S. had previously issued a ''Notice to Airmen'' ([[NOTAM]]) warning aircraft that they were at risk of "defensive measures" if they had not been cleared from a regional airport and if they came within {{convert|5|nmi|km}} of a warship at an altitude of less than {{convert|2000|ft|m}}. Flight 655 had been cleared from a regional airport and was well outside those limits when it was attacked.&lt;ref name=ICJ-Aerial-Incident-IV.B/&gt;{{rp|at=§4.62}} Even if the plane had truly been an Iranian F-14, Iran argued that the U.S. would not have had the right to shoot it down, as it was flying within Iranian airspace and did not follow a path that could be considered an attack profile, nor did it illuminate ''Vincennes'' with radar.&lt;ref name=ICJ-Aerial-Incident-IV.B/&gt;{{rp|at=§4.60–4.61}} Prior to the incident, ''Vincennes'' had entered Iranian territorial waters,&lt;ref name=ICJ-Aerial-Incident-IV.B /&gt;{{rp|at=§4.65}} and was inside these waters when it launched its missiles.&lt;ref name=ICJ-Aerial-Incident-IV.B /&gt;{{rp|at=§1.27}} Even had the crew of Flight 655 made mistakes, the U.S. government would still remain responsible for the actions of ''Vincennes''{{'}} crew, under international law.&lt;ref name=ICJ-Aerial-Incident-IV.B/&gt;{{rp|at=§4.56}}

Iran pointed out that in the past "the United States has steadfastly condemned the shooting down of aircraft, whether civil or military, by the armed forces of another State" and cited [[El Al Flight 402]], [[Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114]] and [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]], among other incidents.&lt;ref name=ICJ-Aerial-Incident-IV.B /&gt;{{rp|at=§4.66–4.70}} Iran also noted that when Iraq attacked {{USS|Stark|FFG-31|6}}, United States found Iraq fully responsible on the grounds that the Iraqi pilot "knew or should have known" that he was attacking a U.S. warship.&lt;ref name=ICJ-Aerial-Incident-IV.B /&gt;{{rp|at=§4.49}}

In an article published in ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine on 13 July 1992, John Barry and Roger Charles argued that Rogers behaved recklessly and without due care.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com" /&gt; However, the subsequent Fogarty report concluded that Rogers acted in a prudent manner based on the information available to him, and the short time frame involved. He also proceeded according to the prescribed rules of engagement for USN warship captains in that situation.

The [[International Court of Justice]] case relating to the attack, "the Aerial Incident of July 3, 1988, (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

Three years after the incident, Admiral Crowe admitted on American television show ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' that ''Vincennes'' was inside Iranian territorial waters when it launched the missiles.&lt;ref name=nightline19920701 /&gt; This contradicted earlier navy statements.

Commander David Carlson, commanding officer of USS ''Sides'', the warship stationed nearest to ''Vincennes'' at the time of the incident, is reported to have said that the destruction of the aircraft "marked the horrifying climax to Captain Rogers's aggressiveness, first seen four weeks ago".&lt;ref name="Fisk, 2005"&gt;Fisk, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; His comment referred to incidents on 2 June, when Rogers had sailed ''Vincennes'' too close to an Iranian frigate undertaking a lawful search of a bulk carrier, launched a helicopter within {{convert|2|-|3|mi|km}} of a small Iranian craft despite [[rules of engagement]] requiring a four-mile (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) separation, and opened fire on small Iranian military boats. Of those incidents, Carlson commented, "Why do you want an Aegis cruiser out there shooting up boats? It wasn't a smart thing to do." He also said that Iranian forces he had encountered in the area a month prior to the incident were "pointedly non-threatening" and professional.&lt;ref name="procpdf"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.geocities.com/csafdari/Proceedings.pdf |pages=87–92|title=The Vincennes Incident (letter)|author=Commander David R Carlson|journal=US Naval Institute Proceedings|volume=115/9/1039|date=September 1989|accessdate=29 February 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080229003110/http://www.geocities.com/csafdari/Proceedings.pdf|archivedate=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Rogers's announcement to higher command that he was going to shoot down the plane, Carlson is reported to have been thunderstruck: "I said to folks around me, 'Why, what the hell is he doing?' I went through the drill again. F-14. He's climbing. By now this damn thing is at 7,000 feet." Carlson thought ''Vincennes'' might have more information, and was unaware that Rogers had been wrongly informed that the plane was diving.&lt;ref name="Fisk, 2005"/&gt; Carlson is also reported to have written in the U.S. Naval Proceedings that he had "wondered aloud in disbelief" on hearing of ''Vincennes''{{'}} intentions, speculating that the ship, known as ''"RoboCruiser"'' for its aggressiveness, "felt a need to prove the viability of Aegis in the Persian Gulf, and that they hankered for the opportunity to show their stuff."&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;[[Noam Chomsky]], [http://zcomm.org/zmagazine/outrage/ 'Outrage,'] [[Z Magazine]] 24 August 2014:'There was little reaction at the time: no outrage, no desperate search for victims, no passionate denunciations of those responsible, no eloquent laments by the U.S. Ambassador to the UN about the "immense and heart-wrenching loss" when the airliner was downed.

An angry Captain Richard McKenna, Chief of Surface Warfare for the Commander of the Joint Task Force, ordered Rogers back to [[Abu Musa]], but a ''Vincennes'' helicopter pilot, Lt. Mark Collier, followed the Iranian speedboats as they retreated north, eventually taking some fire:
{{quotation|...the Vincennes jumps back into the fray. Heading towards the majority of the speedboats, he is unable to get a clear target. Also, the speedboats are now just slowly milling about in their own territorial waters. Despite clear information to the contrary, Rogers informs command that the gunboats are gathering speed and showing hostile intent and gains approval to fire upon them at 0939. Finally, in another fateful decision, he crosses the {{convert|12|NM|km|sing=on}} limit off the coast and enters illegally into Iranian waters.&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;}}

==Radio communication==
Throughout its final flight, Flight 655 was in radio contact with various air traffic control services using standard civil aviation frequencies, and had spoken in English to Bandar Abbas Approach Control seconds before ''Vincennes'' launched its missiles. According to the U.S. Navy investigation, ''Vincennes'' at that time had no equipment suitable for monitoring civil aviation frequencies, other than the [[International Air Distress]] frequency. Subsequently U.S. Navy warships in the area were equipped with dialable [[VHF]] radios, and access to flight plan information was sought, to better track commercial airliners.

The official [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] report stated that 10 attempts were made to contact Iran Air flight 655: seven on military frequencies and three on commercial frequencies, addressed to an "unidentified Iranian aircraft" and giving its speed as {{convert|350|kn|km/h}}, which was the [[ground speed]] of the aircraft their radar reported.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; Flight 655's crew, however, would have seen a speed of {{convert|300|kn|km/h}} on their cockpit instruments, which was their [[indicated airspeed]], possibly leading them to conclude that ''Vincennes'' was talking to another aircraft.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Both ''Sides'' and ''Vincennes'' tried contacting flight 655 on several civilian and military frequencies. International investigations concluded that the Flight 655's crew assumed that the three calls that they received before the missiles struck must have been directed at an Iranian [[P-3 Orion]] (see below).

==Potential factors==
* The ship's crew did not efficiently consult [[commercial airliner]] schedules due to confusion over which [[time zone]] the schedules referred to – the scheduled flight times used [[Bandar Abbas]] airport time while ''Vincennes'' was on Bahrain time. The airliner's departure was 27 minutes later than scheduled. "The [[Combat Information Center]] (CIC) was also very dark, and the few lights that it did have flickered every time ''Vincennes'' fired at the [[speedboat]]s. This was of special concern to [[Petty Officer]] Andrew Anderson, who first picked up Flight 655 on radar and thought that it might be a commercial aircraft. As he was searching in the navy's listing of commercial flights, he apparently missed Flight 655 because it was so dark."&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;
* An Iranian [[P-3 Orion|P-3]] was in the area some time before the attack, thought to be flying a "classic targeting profile",&lt;ref name="Fogarty"/&gt; and in some reports providing an explanation why no radar signals were detected from Iran Air Flight 655.&lt;ref name="GaryKlein"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gary|last=Klein|title=Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions, ''Chapter 6'' | publisher=The MIT Press|year=1999| isbn=0-262-61146-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports state that the Airbus was immediately detected after takeoff by the cruiser's [[AN/SPY-1]] radar at a range of {{convert|47|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="kelley-0706"/&gt;
* The psychology and mindset after engaging in a battle with Iranian [[gunboat]]s. There are claims that ''Vincennes'' was engaged in an operation using a decoy [[cargo ship]] to lure Iranian gunboats to a fight.&lt;ref name="dettmer"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Admiral contradicts Navy testimony on downing of Iran jet|first=Jamie|last=Dettmer|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=2 July 1992|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were denied by Fogarty in ''Hearing Before The Investigation Subcommittee and The Defense Policy Panel of The Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, One Hundred Second Congress, Second Session, 21 July 1992.'' Also, the initial claims of ''Vincennes'' being called for help by a cargo ship attacked by Iranian gunboats have been ruled out.&lt;ref name=dettmer/&gt; That leads to claims that the Iranian gunboats were provoked by helicopters inside Iranian waters, not the other way around.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jksonc/docs/ir655-hasc-19920721.html |title=Iran Air 655, House Armed Services Hearing, 21 July 1992 |publisher=Homepage.ntlworld.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206162317/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jksonc/docs/ir655-hasc-19920721.html |archivedate=6 December 2013 }} (Annotated with analysis, commentary, and opinion.

* Just over a year before the Iran Air incident, on 17 May 1987, USS Stark had suffered near-catastrophic damage from two Iraqi Exocet missiles intended for an Iranian ship. Citing among other failures lax self-defense procedures, the Navy awarded the STARK's CO and Tactical Action Officer letters of reprimand that ended their careers.  The Navy also re-emphasized to all officers that defense of their ship was their first duty. With this event fresh in the minds of all Navy COs operating in the Persian Gulf, the Vincennes' crew may have felt that after making attempts to contact the airliner and receiving no response, their first duty was to defend the ship against hostile action.

== Critique of U.S. media coverage ==
[[File:NewsweekIR655.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[Newsweek]]'' covers for 12 September 1983 (left) and 18 July 1988 (right), illustrating the [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007|KAL007]] and Iran Air incidents respectively. The caption "Murder in the Air" framed the KAL incident as a deliberate act of war, whereas "Why It Happened" framed the Iran Air incident as a tragic mistake.&lt;ref name="DavidGiles"&gt;{{cite book|title=Media Psychology|first=David|last=Giles|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9780805840490|year=2003|pages=214–215|quote=Who was responsible for the incident? Coverage of the KAL disaster left little doubt in readers' minds of who the culprits were. ''Newsweek's'' cover page screamed: "MURDER IN THE AIR..." The IA disaster was accompanied by soul searching and questioning. "WHY IT HAPPENED" was ''Newsweek's'' cover line... In short, the KAL incident was framed as deliberate sabotage by a nation—an act of war—whereas the IA incident was framed as a tragic mistake.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Robert Entman]] of [[George Washington University]] studied coverage surrounding the incident in [[Media of the United States|U.S. media]], comparing it to the similar incident that happened to [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]], which was shot down by the [[Soviet Union]] five years earlier. Using material from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', the research found clearly evident [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] techniques used to demonize and blame the foreign enemy.&lt;ref name="DavidGiles"/&gt; He stated that by "de-emphasizing the agency and the victims and by the choice of graphics and adjectives, the news stories about the U.S. downing of an Iranian plane called it a technical problem while the Soviet downing of a Korean jet was portrayed as a moral outrage". However, it is also well noted that the Soviet aircraft had visual contact with the Korean airliner and did not try to make radio contact. The Soviet aircraft then also fired on them at point blank range. Additionally, there were no reported enemy aircraft with weapons when the Soviets downed the Korean aircraft, as was the case with the USS ''Vincennes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title= A Comparative Study of News Coverage of the Government Shutdown|url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54bf3b23e4b0081789b84e07/t/55cec16fe4b05f1da66d056b/1439613295209/A+Comparative+Study+of+News+Coverage+of+the+Government+Shutdown+Pattillo,+Natalie.pdf|first=Natalie |last=Pattillo|first2=Esther|last2=Rumsey|conference=Council for Opportunity in Education|publisher=Pell Institute|pages=9–11|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The study is important not only because it demonstrates the [[ethnocentric]] [[media bias]], but also because Entman included polling that appears to show that the unbalanced coverage swayed [[public opinion]] against the Soviet Union and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Cruikshank|first=Sally Ann|date=November 2009|title= U.S. Presidential Politics on the Global Stage: A Content Analysis of 2008 Election Coverage on Al Jazeera, the BBC, and Russia Today|degree=Master of Science|chapter= |publisher=[[E.

==Aftermath==
The event sparked an intense international controversy, with Iran condemning the attack. In mid-July 1988, Iranian Foreign Minister [[Ali Akbar Velayati]] asked the [[United Nations Security Council]] to condemn the United States saying the attack "could not have been a mistake" and was a "criminal act", a "massacre", and an "atrocity". [[George H. W. Bush]], at the time vice president of the United States in the [[Reagan administration]], defended his country at the United Nations by arguing that the U.S. attack had been a wartime incident and that the crew of ''Vincennes'' had acted appropriately to the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEED91731F936A25754C0A96E948260|title=Iran Falls Short in Drive at U.N. To Condemn U.S. in Airbus Case|last=Butterfield|first=Fox|date=15 April 1988|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union asked the U.S. to withdraw from the area and supported efforts by the Security Council to end the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Most of the remainder of the 13 delegates who spoke supported the U.S. position, saying one of the problems was that a 1987 resolution to end the Iran-Iraq war had been ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DE1338F935A25754C0A96E948260|title=Soviets in U.N. Council Ask For U.S. Pullout From Persian Gulf|last=Butterfield|first=Fox|date=16 May 1988|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the debate, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 616|Security Council Resolution 616]] was passed expressing "deep distress" over the U.S. attack and "profound regret" for the loss of human lives, and stressing the need to end the Iran–Iraq War as resolved in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/scres/1988/scres88.htm|title=Security Council Resolutions – 1988|date=|publisher=Un.org|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Iran-stamp-Scott2335.jpg|thumb|Iranian postage stamp issued 11 August 1988 after the shootdown]]

Inside Iran, this shootdown was perceived as a purposeful attack by United States, signalling that the U.S. was about to enter into a direct war against Iran on the side of Iraq.&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"/&gt; In August 1988, a month after the shoot-down, the Iranian government released a 45 [[Iranian rial|rial]] postage stamp illustrating the event, where the ship shooting the missile is painted with the colors of the American flag, with a map of a burning Iran in the background.

In February 1996, the United States agreed to pay Iran US$131.8 million in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the [[International Court of Justice]] relating to this incident,&lt;ref name="ICJ-Aerial-Incident"/&gt; together with other earlier claims before the [[Iran-United States Claims Tribunal]].&lt;ref name="ICJ-settlement-agreement"/&gt; US$61.8 million of the claim was in compensation for the 248 Iranians killed in the shoot-down: $300,000 per wage-earning victim and $150,000 per non-wage-earner. In total, 290 civilians on board were killed, 38 being non-Iranians and 66 being children. It was not disclosed how the remaining $70 million of the settlement was apportioned, though it was close to the value of a used [[Airbus A300|A300]] at the time.

The U.S. government issued notes of regret for the loss of human lives, but never formally apologized or acknowledged wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;The Iran-Iraq War: The Politics of Aggression. By Farhang Rajaee. University Press of Florida, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
George H. W. Bush, the vice president of the United States at the time commented on a separate occasion, speaking to a group of Republican ethnic leaders (7 Aug 1988): "I will never apologize for the United States — I don't care what the facts are... I'm not an apologize-for-America kind of guy." The quote, although unrelated to the downing of the Iranian air liner, has been attributed as such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4555921 C-SPAN / Bush Ethnic Coalition Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://imgur.com/ieLrziL The quote of the Perspectives/Overheard section of Newsweek (15 August 1988) p. 15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968407,00.html Essay: Rally Round the Flag, Boys – TIME&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush used the phrase frequently&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEEDB143CF93AA35752C1A96E948260 ''The 1988 Elections man in the news: George Herbert Walker Bush; A Victor Free to Set His Own Course.''] By Gerald M. Boyd, Special to the New York Times, Published: 9 November 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 campaign]] and promised to "never apologize for the United States" months prior to the July 1988 shoot-down&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFD9103EF934A15751C0A96E948260 ''Bush, a Cautious Front-Runner Again, Avoids Attacks and Personal Campaigning''], Gerald M. Boyd, Special to the New York Times. [[The New York Times]]. (Late Edition (East Coast)). New York, N.Y.: 27 February 1988. pg. 1.8&lt;/ref&gt; and as early as January 1988.&lt;ref&gt;''Bush Sidesteps Campaign Talk In the Bluffs''; [Iowa Edition] C. David Kotok. Omaha World – Herald.

[[The Washington Post]] (pre-1997 Fulltext). Washington, D.C.: 30 October 1988. pg. a.01&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident overshadowed [[Iran–United States relations]] for many years. The former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst [[Kenneth M. Pollack]] wrote: "The shoot-down of Iran Air flight 655 was an accident, but that is not how it was seen in Tehran."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/10/16/the-forgotten-story-of-iran-air-flight-655/ | title=The forgotten story of Iran Air Flight 655 | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the explosion of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] five months later, the British and American governments initially blamed the [[PFLP-GC]], a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militant group backed by [[Syria]], with assumptions of assistance from Iran in retaliation for Flight 655.

===Post-tour of duty medals===
Despite the mistakes made in the downing of the plane, the men of USS ''Vincennes'' were awarded [[Combat Action Ribbon]]s for completion of their tours in a combat zone. The air-warfare coordinator on duty received the [[Navy Commendation Medal]],&lt;ref name="blunders" /&gt; but ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported in 1990 that the awards were for his entire tour from 1984 to 1988 and for his actions relating to the surface engagement with Iranian gunboats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/04/23/2-vincennes-officers-get-medals/cf383f02-05ce-435b-9086-5d61de569ed8/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.8623b4ac0dca|title=2 Vincennes Officers get Medals|author=Molly Moore|date=23 April 1990|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Rogers was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] "for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service as commanding officer [...] from April 1987 to May 1989." The award was given for his service as the commanding officer of ''Vincennes'' from April 1987 to May 1989.

'''James Edward Melbourne''' (''c.'' 1876 – 13 December 1937) was the first [[Indigenous Australian]] to play senior [[Australian rules football]] in a major Australian football league.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hunting the ghost of greased lightning |publisher=West Australian Newspapers Limited|work=[[The West Australian]]|last=Wilson|first=Ray|date=5 September 2009|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melbourne was orphaned at the age of four and spent his formative years in a [[Middle Swan, Western Australia|Middle Swan]] [[orphanage]] before being put into the care of various businessmen in York.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; As a teenager, he was an accomplished [[jockey]] and spent time in prison for petty crimes (including stealing, cashing a cheque, passing [[counterfeit]] coins, and escaping from a lock-up).&lt;ref name="West"/&gt;

Melbourne played his first game for [[West Perth Football Club|West Perth]] against [[East Fremantle Football Club|East Fremantle]] in the [[West Australian Football League|Western Australian Football Association]] (WAFL) on 2 June 1900 and was a member of their 1901 premiership side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-5545-0-0-0&amp;sID=75916&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=5897893&amp;sectionID=75916|title=WAFL Premierships|publisher=Sporting Pulse|accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to [[South Fremantle Football Club|South Fremantle]] in 1902,&lt;ref name="Bulldogs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/sport/a/-/wafl/5701308/south-fremantle-bulldogs-announce-aboriginal-team-of-century/ |title=South Fremantle Bulldogs announce Aboriginal team of century |publisher=West Australian Newspapers Limited |work=[[The West Australian]]|date= 3 July 2009|accessdate=7 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; playing four games,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southfremantlefc.com.au/assets/SFFC/SFFC-Indigenous-Players.pdf South Fremantle Football Club Indigenous League Players] Retrieved 26 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and then went to play for Subiaco in 1903 and 1904.  In 1907, Melbourne played in the Collie Football Association, and then in the Bunbury Football Association until 1908. He was also a boxer and professional runner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xR0RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MJcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=jimmy-melbourne&amp;pg=7005%2C5672140 |title=Battered with axe|work=[[The Age]]|date=13 December 1937|accessdate=7 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later stages of his life he moved to [[Melbourne]], Victoria, and joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] at the outbreak of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="West"/&gt;

'''Joan Dowling''' (6 January 1928 &amp;ndash; 31 March 1954) was an English character actress.

==Life and career==
The illegitimate daughter of Vera Dowling, Joan was brought up by her great-grandmother, Elizabeth Dowling, in [[Uxbridge]]. She had a passion for acting, although she was never formally trained, and took roles in small plays, pantomimes and other productions whenever she could. At the age of 14 she approached a London acting agency and was given her first 'proper' part in a small production (title unknown). Her major acting debut came when producer [[Anthony Hawtrey]] cast her in the role of Norma Bates in the Joan Temple play ''[[No Room at the Inn]]''. The play's first performance was at the [[Embassy Theatre (London)|Embassy Theatre]] in July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Embassy Successes II| author=Anthony Hawtrey (editor)| year=1946| publisher=Sampson, Low, Marston &amp; Co| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, the play transferred under producer Robert Atkins to the Winter Garden Theatre, [[Drury Lane]]. She also played the same role in the 1948 film version, with the screenplay co-written by the famous Welsh author [[Dylan Thomas]] and [[Ivan Foxwell]]. She signed her first film contract at the age of 17 for Associated British Pictures.

She was perhaps best known for her role as the tomboy Clarry in the 1947 [[Ealing Studios]] production ''[[Hue and Cry (film)|Hue and Cry]]'', a story set among the rubble and buildings of post-war London about a group of school children who discover that crooks have been sending coded messages about forthcoming jobs to their gang using the pages of a children's comic.&lt;ref name=DMirror1954.1&gt;''[[Daily Mirror]]'' 1 April 1954 pp 8-9, "Tragedy of Farmer Street's Happy Child"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 she married [[Harry Fowler]], another actor from the cast of ''Hue and Cry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayward|first1=Anthony|title=Harry Fowler: Prolific screen actor known for his 'cheerful cockney' characters|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/harry-fowler-prolific-screen-actor-known-for-his-cheerful-cockney-characters-6286839.html%3Famp|website=The Independent|publisher=independent.co.uk|accessdate=29 January 2017|date=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 31 March 1954, Dowling took her own life by gas poisoning.&lt;ref name=DMirror1954.2&gt;''[[Daily Mirror]]'' 6 April 1954 page 6, "No one in the world for me but Joan, says Harry Fowler"&lt;/ref&gt;

He later joined [[Pierre Chouteau, Jr.]] in a fur trapping and trading business.  He extended his interests into other areas of commerce and became very wealthy.  In the final years of his life he was involved with the landmark court case of ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' [''sic''], which is perhaps what he is best known for today.  He suffered mental illness and died in an asylum.

==Biography==
Sanford's parents were Francis Alexander Sanford (''[[circa|c.]]'' 1782-1848) and Mary Adams.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;John Sanford Barnes, in his autobiography, indicates that his grandmother's name was Charlotte Adam, not Mary&lt;/ref&gt; His step mother, from his father's later marriage, was also named Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vander Velde|first=Lea|title=Mrs Dred Scott|date=2009|publisher=Oxford United Press|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before about 1810 they lived in Westmoreland County, Virginia and after this date up to 1829 their home was in Winchester, Virginia.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;John F. A. Sanford and his sister Charlotte (b.1808) were born in Westmoreland.   Henrietta (b.1811) and the later siblings were born in Winchester. In her biography of Sanford, Janet Lecompte, says she failed to turn up records of the family in Winchester before 1810.&lt;/ref&gt;  John F. A. Sanford, the eldest child of seven, attended the academy at West Point,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrlich|first=Walter|title=Dictionary of Missouri Biography|year=1999|publisher=University of Missouri Press|page=665|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6gyxWHRLAWgC&amp;pg=PA665&amp;lpg=PA665&amp;dq=SANFORD,+JOHN+F.+A.+(1806-1857)#v=onepage&amp;q=SANFORD%2C%20JOHN%20F.%20A.%20(1806-1857)&amp;f=false|isbn=9780826260161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIBLIOGRAPHY , S - USMA Library Digital Collections - West Point|url=http://digital-library.usma.edu/libmedia/archives/thayer/THAPAP11.pdf|work=Page 121|accessdate=18 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317195756/http://digital-library.usma.edu/libmedia/archives/thayer/THAPAP11.pdf|archivedate=17 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and in 1825 became a clerk and interpreter in the St Louis office of Indian Affairs under [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=edited by Louisa BARRY 1948|title=May 1826-February 1831|url=https://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-quarterly-william-clark-s-diary/15491|work=4 KANSAS HISTORICAL QUARTERLY Para 2|publisher=Kansas Historical Society|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1826 he was appointed as a sub-agent in the remote Mandan villages of the upper Missouri.  He replaced the former agent, 29-year-old Peter Wilson, who had died earlier that year after being taken ill in a Mandan settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilson, Peter |author2=Colt, Katherine Gideon. |title=The letters of Peter Wilson, soldier, explorer and Indian agent west of the Mississippi river|year=1940|location=Baltimore: Wirth.page=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period of about seven years Sanford worked with several tribes including Minitarees, Crows, Arikaras, Assiniboines, Knisteneaux and Yanctonais Sioux, estimating that the population in his area was in the order of 75,000.  Sanford tried to resolve underfunding issues and made requests for better pay and for an improvement in his situation.  These were ignored and to further add to his frustration, he was criticised in the House of Representatives for the expenses incurred when he took a delegation of tribesmen to Washington.  This both damaged his career prospects, and came as a personal blow.

In 1832 Sanford struck up a friendship with Pierre Chouteau Jr., a member of the wealthy St Louis fur trading family, and was offered a position in Chouteau's business.  He joined in 1833, later becoming a partner and then the company’s representative in Washington and New York.  Sanford also married Chouteau’s daughter, Emilie, although she died in 1836.  Their only child, Benjamin, was raised by the Chouteau family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lecomte|first=Janet|title=Fur Traders, Trappers, and Mountain Men of the Upper Missouri|year=1995|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|page=51 to 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time Sanford purchased a farm in St Louis for his father, who lived there until his death in 1848.

Sanford became wealthy; his business interests included mining, railroads and mercantile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ralph W. Hidy|author2=Muriel E. Hidy|title=Anglo-American Merchant Bankers and the Railroads of the Old Northwest, 1848-1860|journal=The Business History Review |date=Summer 1960|volume=34|issue= 2|pages=157|jstor=3111545}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1851 he became one of the founder members of a company that was formed to build the [[Illinois Central Railroad]].  In 1850 he married Isabel Davis, daughter of [[Thomas E. Davis]], New York real estate developer.  Sanford with his father-in-law Davis, and brother-in-law, Frederick C. Gebhard, invested in various joint ventures including the [[Saint Anthony Falls#Industry|St Anthony Falls Water Power Company]], [[Allentown Railroad|Allentown Railroad Company]] and the Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kane|first=Lucile M|title=The Falls of St. Anthony: The Waterfall that Built Minneapolis|date=1 Jan 1987|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853 Sanford became involved with a landmark court case: Dred Scott, a slave working for Sanford's brother-in-law, had been seeking his freedom through the courts since 1846.  In 1853 Scott's case went to the Supreme Court with Sanford named as the defendant; the Court ruled in Sanford's favor.

Sanford suffered mental illness during 1857 and was admitted to an asylum.  At one point he was thought to be recovering, but had a relapse and died on 6 May 1857 in Manhattan.

==Family==
In about 1829 Sanford's father moved his family to Fort McHenry, Maryland, to take up the post of an army [[sutler]].  As a consequence, 4 of Sanford's sisters met and married military men: Charlotte married [[James Barnes (general)|General James Barnes]], Henrietta married [[Fort Clark, Texas#Founding|Major John B. Clark]], Mary married Colonel Henry Bainbridge and Irene married army surgeon Dr John Emerson.  The 5th sister, Virginia, who was the youngest, married stove manufacturer Samuel H. Ransom of Albany. Sanford’s brother, naval captain Joseph P. Sanford, married Ransom's sister Lydia, and between tours of service, worked for stove manufacturer Rathbone in Albany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Egotistigraphy by John Sanford Barnes - Internet Edition © 2012 &gt; |url=https://sites.google.com/site/johnsanfordbarnes/home/chapter-vi|publisher=Susan Bainbridge Hay|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=John Sanford Barnes - a Memorial|year=1912|publisher=Privately Printed|page=7|url=https://archive.org/stream/johnsanfordbarne00gamm#page/6/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Joseph's father Alexander had also been involved with a foundry business during his time in Winchester&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanford's second wife, Isabel, moved to Paris, France in the 1860s with the 2 children from their marriage - Emilie and John Francis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SALA-SANFORD Isabel (1832-1898) Buried family|url=http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=3972&amp;var_recherche=sanford|work=CEMETERY Père Lachaise|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emilie, married French diplomat Count Maurice Sala.  Their son, Count Antoine Sala, married Laura Bache Kayser, daughter of [[Kayser-Roth|Julius Kayser]], silk glove and hosiery manufacturer.

By coincidence, Isabel's uncle, [[John Power (Vicar-General for New York)|Rev. John Power]], Vicar General of New York, had baptized Sanford's son, Benjamin Chouteau Sanford, many years previously in New York, on 12 February 1837.  The sponsors were Robert Anderson, Charles Chouteau, Julia Chouteau and Mary Bainbridge.&lt;ref&gt;Early U.S. French Catholic Church Records (Drouin Collection), 1695-1954 for Benjamin Chouteau Sanford&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of a woman between twenty-four and thirty-three years old was discovered in Van Nuys, Los Angeles County, California on July 21, 1987. Her body was wrapped in a tarp and some blankets. The body was found weeks afterward. The victim had been strangled and had her arms severed at the elbows, preventing analysis of fingerprints. She had brown hair and eyes, had braces at one time in her life and also had some missing teeth and fillings in her mouth. She wore what appeared to be a handmade dress, a bra, [[Slip (clothing)|slip]], underwear and mismatched shoes, one being a high heel and the other an open toed shoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 4117|url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/4117|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=23 February 2015|date=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female was about five feet eight inches tall and was at a weight between 110 and 120 pounds. Further physical examination indicated she had been pregnant at one point in life and had consumed cocaine before her murder.

The extensively decomposed remains of a young female were found at the side of a [[freeway]] in the [[Santa Ana Canyon]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] on August 30, 1987. The victim's body had almost completely [[Skeletonization|skeletonized]] at the time of discovery, although some fragments of soft tissue were still present upon the remains. The victim—also known as Jane Doe 87-04092 EL—was a slender young woman who had medium length light hair; she was likely between 15 and 19 years old when she died,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remains in Canyon are that of a Woman|url=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v247/suzannec4444/Tammy/Orangecounty1a.jpg|accessdate=2 October 2014|agency=Anaheim Bulletin|date=1 September 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may possibly have been a teenage runaway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remains in Canyon are that of a Woman|url=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v247/suzannec4444/Tammy/OrangeCounty3.jpg|accessdate=2 October 2014|agency=Anaheim Bulletin|date=1 September 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the crime scene, enough hair was found with the body to determine that the girl had [[blond]] or light brown hair, although no personal belongings beyond a red handkerchief were discovered with her remains. Her skull was [[forensic facial reconstruction|reconstructed]] by Shannon Collis in hopes of identifying the body, determining she also had high [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]]. One of her front teeth was slightly chipped, while three of her other teeth had visible cavities, and six molars were missing. She was estimated to be between five feet one to five feet four inches tall. It is believed that the victim had died around six weeks before her body was discovered, meaning she likely died in July 1987. She may possibly have died by repeated stab wounds to her chest area, as incisive damage to two of her ribs suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Needham|first1=John|title=ID-ing the Dead : Bodies of John and Jane Does Trigger Special Concern Among 34 Members of Coroner's Office|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-17/news/li-996_1_deputy-coroner|accessdate=6 October 2014|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=17 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, her death was ruled as a definite homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eddy|first1=Steve|title=3D Techniques may ID dead Teen-Ager: Skull of girl found in canyon used in OC's first facial reconstruction|url=http://www.img.photobucket.com/albums/v247/suzannec4444/Tammy/Orangecountya.jpg|accessdate=2 October 2014|agency=Orange County Register|date=26 October 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{cite web| last=Bishop| first=Alex| title=Unsolved Murder Spotlight: The Orange County Jane Doe| url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/blog/2013/05/30/unsolved-murder-spotlight-the-orange-county-jane-doe/index.html| publisher=Crimelibrary.com| accessdate=16 April 2014| date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icaremissingpersonscoldcases.yuku.com"&gt;{{cite web| title=Unidentified Jane Doe in 1987 in Aneheim California|url=http://icaremissingpersonscoldcases.yuku.com/topic/765/Unidentified-Jane-Doe-in-1987-in-Aneheim-California#.U1FaefldXTo| accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Case File 22UFCA"&gt;{{cite web| title=Case File 22UFCA| url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/22ufca.html| publisher=[[The Doe Network]]| accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jane Doe 1987"&gt;{{cite web| title=Jane Doe 1987| url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1184201| publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]| accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the [[DNA Doe Project]] took on Anaheim Jane Doe's case.

A Hispanic female, who suffered trauma to the head, was found lying on her back, deceased, in an alley on May 25, 1989 in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. The girl was believed to be between the ages of twelve and fifteen when she died hours before her discovery due to an undisclosed cause. The height and weight of the female were estimated to be five feet three inches and 124 pounds, respectively. Her hair was either black or dark brown and her eyes were also brown. The texture of her hair is disputed, as some sources state she had curly hair and others claim it was straight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1989|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1184145/1/screen|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her young age, she had multiple tattoos: an "oval or diamond" shaped design around the letters "p," "o," "h" and "s" along with another on the back her upper right leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 3979|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/3979|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=7 July 2015|date=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tattoos were hard to read and probably homemade.&lt;ref name="Case File 484UFCA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 484UFCA|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/484ufca.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girl wore a blue shirt that read "Somebody in California Loves Me," dark blue but faded jeans, a tan bra, white or green underwear, white socks and black shoes with some red.

On April 26, 1991, the body of a woman was found lying face-up in Vacaville, Solano County, California. The victim had died from some sort of asphyxia, either by strangulation or suffocation. She was twenty-five to thirty-five years old and was approximately five feet five inches tall. She is presumed to be white with Native American characteristics and had long hair that was brownish-blond. Although she was too decomposed to determine eye color, her fingerprints were obtained along with her dental information and DNA. She had fillings and five missing teeth, but three of them had been lost after her death. She was wearing a long-sleeved dress that was dark along with a sweater and a blue tank top, with a wool cap. No other clothing was found, except for a jacket covering the body and her dress had been pulled above her waist, indicating she was sexually assaulted. A ring with a green stone and a watch with a silver-colored face were also worn by the victim. Her body was exhumed in 1998. Along with wearing a large amount of clothing, the victim's legs were not shaved, possibly indicating she was a transient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 63UFCA|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/63ufca.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 1992, the body of a Hispanic female was discovered inside of several trash bags in [[South Central Los Angeles]], Los Angeles County, California. Despite being four feet six inches tall, her age was estimated to between fourteen and twenty-five years old. She wore a white shirt and skirt, two silver-colored rings on her right hand, a black belt, a purple slip and was found barefoot. She was of medium complexion and build, weighing 127 pounds.

On October 24, 1994, the body of a white female was found near Thousand Palms, Riverside County, California. She was elderly, at an age between sixty-five and eighty years old upon the time of her murder. She had been wrapped in plastic that was then secured with a brown cord that was partially concealed in the sand at the scene. The woman was approximately five feet four inches tall, although her weight could not be estimated due to decomposition. The woman had no teeth, but had worn dentures that were found with her body. However, these did not assist with the investigation as they lacked a brand name or a serial number. The woman wore blue shorts, a red shirt and a pair of underwear, but no shoes. She had brown and gray short hair and an eleven-inch scar on her abdomen that had healed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 100UFCA|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/100ufca.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also suffered from [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] and [[Arteriosclerotic heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 7040|url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/7040|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=4 December 2014|date=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of a woman was found on March 29, 1995 in Holt, San Joaquin County, California inside of a refrigerator bound with rope near a road. She had been murdered by a blow to the head with a blunt object around a year before she was found. The body was covered with a sleeping bag as well as a quilt. She was twenty-nine to forty-one years old and was five feet five to five feet seven inches at a weight of 110 to 130 pounds. She was white with strawberry-blond hair, had manicured nails and jewelry, including a wedding ring. She also possibly wore a charm necklace, as remnants of a leather band were located in her pocket. She wore a blue sweatshirt, denim shorts, a tee shirt, a bra, knee-high socks with various colors and expensive boots. It is believed that the refrigerator with her remains originated from elsewhere in California and likely floated along a levee to the location it was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 320UFCA|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/320ufca.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bodies of two Hispanic men were discovered in July 1997 in Gilroy, Santa Clara County, California. The first victim's torso was found severely decomposed on July 16; his skull was also later found. He was between thirty and fifty years of age. His clothing included a Nike shirt and jeans. A second man was found on July 31 and was fifteen to forty years old. Both men were between five feet five and five feet seven inches and may have been killed by asphyxiation. It is also believed that they were disposed of in a sewer line, which lead to the Gilroy Sewage Treatment Plant. They may have been native to Mexico and could have been involved in the drug trade.

In Clarksburg, Yolo County, California, a man's body was found on March 4, 1999. He was a victim of homicide, as he was stabbed in the chest. He was killed months before his remains were found, which were so badly decomposed that his race was not possible to estimate. He was fully clothed and placed underneath a sleeping bag next to the Elk Slough estuary. He was between twenty and thirty-five years old and stood around five feet eleven inches tall at a weight of 182 pounds. His clothing included a tee shirt with a green "M," white and blue shoes and a green pair of boxers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 275UMCA|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/275umca.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About ten days after he was suffocated, an infant's body was located on a recycling [[conveyor belt]] on February 10, 2004 in [[Stanton, California]]. He was likely killed on the day he was born, as his placenta and umbilical cord had not yet been severed from his body. A towel was found nearby with blood on it, which may have been used during the birth and, later, to murder the infant. A newspaper and a plastic bag were also found at the scene.

When he pulled one of the [[Payless ShoeSource|Pro Wing]] shoes from the dirt, a foot came with it.

Associated with the remains, besides the shoes, were a rusty jack knife, long underwear pants, and a T-shirt. DNA testing was requested. So was botanical testing on roots intertwined with the bones.

'''Louis of Durazzo''' (1324 – 22 July 1362) was [[Count of Gravina]] and [[Morrone]]. He was the son of [[John of Gravina]] and [[Agnes of Périgord]].{{sfn|Zacour|1960|p=32}}

In 1337, he was named Vicar- and Captain-General of the [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]]. During the ascension of the Durazzeschi at the court of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] during the reign of [[Joanna I of Naples|Joanna I]], he was one of the royal ambassadors to the [[Roman Curia]]. Upon the invasion of [[Louis I of Hungary]] and the execution of his elder brother, [[Charles, Duke of Durazzo]], in 1348, he was imprisoned, with his younger brother [[Robert of Durazzo]], until 1352. The rest of his life was spent stirring up revolts against Joanna in [[Apulia]] with the aid of some [[Free Companies|Free Companions]]. These were ultimately quashed in 1360 by [[Louis of Taranto]], and Louis of Durazzo was imprisoned in the [[Castel dell'Ovo]] in Naples and murdered by poison.

==Family==
He married Margaret of Sanseverino in 1343, by whom he had three children:{{sfn|Casteen|2015|p=iii}}

[[File:Ludwig Becker Self Portrait (between 1850..1861) SmallFiltered.jpg|thumb|Ludwig Becker, by [[Frederick Schoenfeld]]]]
'''Ludwig Becker''' (5 September 1808 – 29 April 1861) was a German artist, explorer and naturalist. He was born in [[Rödelheim]] near [[Frankfurt]] am Main. He moved to Australia in 1850, and was a member of the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills expedition]]. He died at the expedition's camp on the western bank of Koorliatto Waterhole, [[Bulloo River]] in 1861.

==Early years==
Becker was born at [[Rödelheim]] near [[Frankfurt]] am Main, Germany, in 1808. He left Germany in 1850. As was common practice at the time, he was referred to as Dr. Becker, but had not studied at a university.

His father was Ernst Friedrich Becker (1750–1826) and his mother was Amöne Eleonore Weber (1782–1819). Becker was the eldest of five children from this marriage. After his mother's death, Becker's father married Johanette Christiane Weber, a younger sister of his first wife. They had three more children.

After some time in England he travelled from [[Liverpool]] in November 1850 on the ship ''Hannah'' via [[Pernambuco|Pernambuco, Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Becker – Letters, 1850–1855 to Dr. Kaup; in German with some English translations, Manuscripts in the Mitchell Library NSW, CY REEL 603, ML*D83&lt;/ref&gt; and arrived in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], [[Van Diemen's Land]] in early 1851. He was described by Lady [[William Denison|Denison]] as "one of those universal geniuses who can do anything ... a very good naturalist, geologist ... draws and plays and sings, conjures and ventriloquises and imitates the notes of birds so accurately". From 1852 until 1854, while mining for gold in [[Bendigo]], Becker made meteorological observations and produced sketches which he exhibited in Melbourne in April 1854. He became a council member of the Victorian Society of Fine Arts in 1856 and of the [[Royal Society of Victoria|Philosophical Institute of Victoria]] in 1859, and was a leading member of the German Club. He corresponded with [[ornithologist]] and [[zoologist]] [[John Gould]], known as the father of bird study in Australia, on the [[lyrebird]], and was one of the first to try to raise a lyrebird chick and sent sketches of the egg to ornithologists in Germany and France.

He illustrated botanical works for [[Ferdinand Mueller]] including ''[[Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae]]'' (1858–82) and ''The Plants Indigenous to the Colony of Victoria'' (1860–65).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/becker-ludwig.html "Becker, Ludwig (1808–61)"], [[Australian National Herbarium]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burke and Wills expedition==
His scientific knowledge and artistic ability qualified him for selection as a member&lt;ref&gt;Anne Matthews: "Ludwig Becker, Artist and Scientist in the Desert", pp. 148ff; in: ''Sheena Coupe, Frontier Country – Australia's Outback Heritage'', Vol. 1, Willoughby: Weldon Russell (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; of the Victorian Exploring Expedition in 1860–61, which has since become known as the [[Burke and Wills expedition]]. It was organised by the Philosophical Institute of Victoria which in 1860 became the [[Royal Society of Victoria]].

The Burke and Wills expedition was led by [[Robert O'Hara Burke]], a police superintendent in the [[Castlemaine, Victoria]] district. In 1860 he was given leave to take command of the exploring expedition to cross the continent from Melbourne in the south to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] in the north. The objectives of the expedition were hazy and its route, from [[Cooper Creek]] to the Gulf of Carpentaria, was decided less than a month before it set out. Burke's instructions, sent after him because they were not ready at the time, were lengthy and vague. The real object of the expedition appears to have been to snatch from the South Australian explorer, [[John McDouall Stuart]], the honour of making the first south-north crossing of the continent. Sir [[Henry Barkly]], Governor of Victoria 1856–1863, described it as "the glorious race across the continent between the expeditions fitted out in this and the adjacent colony of South Australia".

The Burke and Wills expedition was the most expensive in the history of Australian exploration.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} It cost over £60,000 and would eventually claim seven lives. The expedition was provided with more than two dozen camels, imported complete with [[Afghan (Australia)|cameleers]]. There were horses and wagons, food for two years and lavish equipment. The party consisted of five officers: Burke, Landells as second-in-command, and William John Wills, third-in-command and surveyor and meteorologist and the two German scientific officers: Becker and Hermann Beckler, medical officer and botanist. The expedition also included a foreman, nine assistants and the camel-drivers.

The expedition left Melbourne on 20 August 1860 and made progress through the settled districts of Victoria to [[Swan Hill]] and [[Balranald]] and reached [[Menindee]] on the [[Darling River]] at the beginning of October. Burke was in haste and left much of his provisions at Balranald and more at Menindee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phoenix|first=Dave|title=Following Burke and Wills across Victoria: a touring guide|publisher=Phoenix|year=2011|isbn=9780646564197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker, as artist, naturalist and geologist on a salary of £300, received lengthy instructions from Doctor [[John Macadam]], honorary secretary of the Exploration Committee, which stipulated that he should collect specimens, keep a diary and produce daily maps with illustrations and sections. He sent his first dispatches from Swan Hill, and from Menindee sent a number of specimens. He became despondent when these were not acknowledged.

Burke became impatient with the time lost in making scientific investigations and ordered Becker and Beckler to cease their investigations and work like the rest of the men and walk instead of ride. In a report to the Exploration Committee, Landells wrote that Burke requested him not to allow Becker to ride and had observed that if Becker accompanied the expedition, and got through, people would say that it would not be difficult to cross to Carpentaria, and that he was to be walked until he gave in. At one stage Becker did not eat for three days and became faint. He had to wait until everyone was asleep to do his writing and sketching.

After quarrelling with Burke, Landells resigned at Menindee and Burke promoted Wills to second in command, replacing him as third officer by a local man, [[William Wright (explorer)|William Wright]], who proved incompetent and unreliable.

Burke's orders were that his base camp was to be at Cooper Creek; instead, he divided his party, transport and provisions, dashing on to Cooper Creek with an advance party and ordering Wright to follow with as little delay as possible. However, Wright waited in Menindee for three months – by which time Burke had travelled to the Gulf of Carpentaria and back – before transporting the vital reserve transport and provisions the 400 miles to Cooper Creek.

Becker was with Wright's party in Menindee. Frustrated by the lack of communication from the Exploration Committee, he no longer wrote his daily reports and concentrated instead on sketching. He became aware of the possible failure of the expedition, but his letter to the committee about the delays was ignored.

Wright's party moved north at the end of January 1861, and reached Torowoto Swamp, about halfway from Menindee to Cooper Creek on 12 February. By this time Becker and others were suffering from [[scurvy]] and the effects of bad water. At their camp at Rat Point, Becker and William Purcell, the cook, were very ill. Wright moved on to try to reach Cooper Creek, but only made it to Bulloo and returned. Beckler remained with the sick members, and on 8 April wrote to his brother of Becker's illness and the unlikelihood of his recovery, stating that, "I shall have to bury him here, and then what an outcry there will be for me in Melbourne!"

Wright wanted to send the sick men back to Menindee, but Beckler told him that they could not make a single day's journey. Wright then ordered the party on to Bulloo, which they reached on 21 April. Wright's party never continued onto Cooper Creek.

Meanwhile, Burke, impatient for Wright's arrival at Cooper Creek, selected Wills, King and Gray to accompany him to the gulf and left four men under the command of William Brahe, one of the assistants, at camp LXV at Cooper Creek. Burke decided to explore on foot and took provisions for twelve weeks and six camels and a horse as pack animals. It took four months to complete the 1500 miles, and Gray died before they returned to camp LXV at Cooper Creek. When Burke's party reached camp LXV on 21 April 1861, spent, starving and in rags, they found it deserted. Brahe's party, having given up hope of seeing Burke and Wills, had left that day for Menindee with six camels, twelve horses, all the clothes and most of the food. Burke decided that as they were in bad shape and had only two camels, they would not be able to catch Brahe's party and would not survive the 400-mile journey. He decided to make for [[Mount Hopeless (South Australia)|Mount Hopeless]], a 150-mile journey away, leaving a message of their intentions at camp LXV.

Brahe's party arrived at Wright's camp at Bulloo on 28 April. The natives were hostile, and had attacked the camp on 27 April. During this period, Becker was mostly unconscious and died on 29 April. He was buried near the graves of Purcell and Charles Stone who had died a few days earlier. The Commission of Enquiry into the causes of the deaths of Burke and Wills also found, from Dr Beckler's evidence, that Dr Becker died of [[dysentery]] and the exhaustion consequent upon it; of course with some peculiar symptoms, which were principally owing to the scurvy. After his burial, Becker's clothes, bedding and tent were burned and his other effects were placed in a pack for conveyance to Melbourne.

Becker had made meteorological observations daily until a month before he died. His death was lamented in newspapers and journals both in the Australian colonies and in Germany, and he was mourned by colleagues at the Royal Society. Governor [[Henry Barkly|Barkly]] paid tribute to "one of the earliest and most indefatigable contributors ... the name of Ludwig Becker will ... rank with those of [[Allan Cunningham (botanist)|Cunningham]], [[Edmund Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Ludwig Leichhardt|Leichhardt]] and the rest of that noble band who have sacrificed their lives in the cause of science." The City of [[Ballarat]] commemorated the expedition with a clock tower in 1863 referring to the deaths of "The Victorian Explorers Burke, Wills, Gray and Becker". The small Queensland parish of [http://www.geodata.us/australia_names_maps/aumaps.php?fid=134685&amp;f=133&amp;name=Becker Becker] perpetuates his name and some timber posts mark his grave.

==Legacy==
This expedition paved the way for settlement in the area, with the first recorded settlement being [[Bulloo Downs Station|Bulloo Downs]] taken up by Jones, Sullivan and Molesworth Green in 1864.

Becker's papers were used as the basis for a novelization of his life, published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Edmond; ''The Supply Party: Ludwig Becker on the Burke and Wills Expedition'', Glenside (Adelaide): East Street Publications 2009. {{ISBN|1-92103726-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dr Ludwig Becker's Grave]] is now listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite QHR|16122|Dr Ludwig Becker's Grave|601359|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Magical Death''''' is a documentary film by anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]] that explores the role of the [[Shamanism|shaman]] within the [[Ya̧nomamö|Yanomamo]] culture, as well as the close relationship shamanism shares with politics within their society.

Chagnon and frequent collaborator [[Tim Asch]] allegedly disputed over the content of the film when Asch objected to its graphic depictions of the Yanomami engaging in symbolic death and cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2000/09/28/yanomamo/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was awarded the American Film Festival Blue Ribbon.

'''Marios Kyriazis''' ({{lang-el|Μάριος Κυριαζής}})  (born 11 March 1956) is a medical [[Physician|doctor]] and [[gerontologist]]. He is known for work, publications and involvement with [[life extension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/diet/8822879/Has-the-fountain-of-youth-been-found.html|title=Has the fountain of youth been found?|last=Llewellyn-Smith|first=Julia|date=2011-10-25|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the concept of [[hormesis]] on anti-ageing medicine, Kyriazis controversially suggested that leading a stressful, irregular and constantly stimulating lifestyle may be a way of reducing the impact of age-related dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/get-stressed-stay-young-the-new-health-advice-vmcbgvmrl7p|title=Get stressed, stay young; the new health advice|last=Templeton|first=Sarah-Kate|date=2005-05-08|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en|issn=0956-1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Little-stress-a-day-keeps-the-doc-away/articleshow/1102355.cms|title=Little stress a day keeps the doc away - Times of India|work=The Times of India|date=May 7, 2005|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/health/anti-ageing-experts-share-their-secrets-2033328|title=Anti-ageing experts share their secrets|work=IOL Lifestyle|last=Coleman|first=Claire|date=12 June 2016|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical history==

In 1996 Kyriazis founded the Historical Medical Equipment Society,{{cn|date=June 2018}} which aims to study old medical instruments related to the history of medicine in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hmes.org.uk |year=2009 |title=Introduction |author=Staff writer |website=Historical Medical Equipment Society |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817231441/http://hmes.org.uk/ |archive-date=17 August 2011 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;The first public lecture was given at the [[University of London]] with support from the [[Wellcome Trust]].  As of July 2018, the society is no longer in existence. 

In 2001, in association with the [[Larnaca]] Municipality, he organised an exhibition on the medical history in Cyprus with the theme "Medicine in Ancient Kition and Old Larnaca",{{cn|date=June 2018}} accompanied by a book on the matter with the same title.&lt;ref name="Kyriazēs2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kyriazēs|first=Marios|title=Medicine in ancient Kition and old Larnaca|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T--LngEACAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Dēmos Larnakas|isbn=978-9963-603-24-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the tradition of other [[Benefactor (law)|benefactors]] in the family (such as his grandfather Dr [[Neoclis Kyriazis]] and his great- uncle [[Damianos Kyriazis]]), in 2008 he founded the [[Kyriazis Medical Museum]], a cultural [[charitable foundation]] aiming to safe keep old medical items and traditions of [[Cyprus]], and to educate the public on the [[Cypriot Medical History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kyriazis-medical-museum|title=Kyriazis Medical Museum in Cyprus|website=Atlas Obscura|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Health conditions --&gt;
A lack of periods, known as [[amenorrhea]], is when periods do not occur by age 15 or have not occurred in 90 days.&lt;ref name=Women2014Men/&gt; Other problems with the menstrual cycle include [[dysmenorrhea|painful periods]] and [[abnormal uterine bleeding|abnormal bleeding]] such as bleeding between periods or heavy bleeding.&lt;ref name=Women2014Men/&gt; [[Menstruation (mammal)|Menstruation in other animals]] occur in [[primates]] ([[apes]] and [[monkeys]]).&lt;ref name=Kris2013&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kristin H.

&lt;!-- Menstruation cycle --&gt;
The [[menstrual cycle]] occurs due to the rise and fall of [[hormones]].&lt;ref name=Women2014Men/&gt; This cycle results in the thickening of the lining of the uterus, and the growth of an [[ovum|egg]], (which is required for [[pregnancy]]).&lt;ref name=Women2014Men/&gt; The egg is released from an ovary around day fourteen in the cycle; the thickened lining of the uterus provides [[nutrient]]s to an embryo after [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].&lt;ref name=Women2014Men/&gt; If pregnancy does not occur, the lining is released in what is known as menstruation.&lt;ref name=Women2014Men/&gt;
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Onset and frequency==
[[File:Lining of Uterine Wall.jpg|thumb|Diagram illustrating how the [[endometrium|uterus lining]] builds up and breaks down during the menstrual cycle.]]
The first menstrual period occurs after the onset of pubertal growth, and is called [[menarche]]. The average age of menarche is 12 to 15.&lt;ref name=Jones2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karapanou O, Papadimitriou A | title = Determinants of menarche | journal = Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology | volume = 8 | issue =  | pages = 115 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20920296 | pmc = 2958977 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7827-8-115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may start as early as eight.&lt;ref name=Women2014Men/&gt; The average age of the first period is generally later in the [[developing world]], and earlier in the [[developed world]].&lt;ref name=Diaz2006/&gt; The average age of menarche has changed little in the United States since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Diaz2006/&gt;

Menstruation is the most visible phase of the menstrual cycle and its beginning is used as the marker between cycles. The first day of menstrual bleeding is the date used for the last menstrual period (LMP). The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women, and 21 to 31 days in adults (an average of 28 days).&lt;ref name=Women2014Men/&gt;&lt;ref name=Diaz2006/&gt;

[[Perimenopause]] is when fertility in a female declines, and menstruation occurs less regularly in the years leading up to the final menstrual period, when a female stops menstruating completely and is no longer fertile. The medical definition of [[menopause]] is one year without a period and typically occurs between 45 and 55 in Western countries.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Def/&gt;&lt;ref name=isbn_0674013433 /&gt;{{rp|p. 381}}

During pregnancy and for some time after childbirth, menstruation does not occur; this state is known as [[amenorrhoea]]. If menstruation has not resumed, fertility is low during [[lactation]]. The average length of postpartum amenorrhoea is longer when certain [[breastfeeding]] practices are followed; this may be done intentionally as [[birth control]].

==Health effects==
{{Further|Premenstrual syndrome}}
In most women, various physical changes are brought about by fluctuations in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. This includes muscle contractions of the uterus (menstrual cramping) that can precede or accompany menstruation. Some may notice water retention, changes in sex drive, fatigue, breast tenderness, or nausea. [[Breast]] swelling and discomfort may be caused by water retention during menstruation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Price WA, Giannini AJ | title = Binge eating during menstruation | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 44 | issue = 11 | pages = 431 | date = November 1983 | pmid = 6580290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, such sensations are mild, and some females notice very few physical changes associated with menstruation. A healthy diet, reduced consumption of salt, caffeine and alcohol, and regular exercise may be effective for women in controlling some symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water retention: Relieve this premenstrual symptom|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water-retention/WO00130|publisher=Mayo Clinic|access-date=20 September 2011|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925030511/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water-retention/WO00130|archive-date=25 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severe symptoms that disrupt daily activities and functioning may be diagnosed as [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]]. Symptoms before menstruation are known as premenstrual molimina.

===Cramps===
{{Further|Dysmenorrhea}}
Many women experience painful cramps, also known as [[dysmenorrhea]], during menstruation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ju H, Jones M, Mishra G | title = The prevalence and risk factors of dysmenorrhea | journal = Epidemiologic Reviews | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 104–13 | date = 1 January 2014 | pmid = 24284871 | doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxt009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain results from [[ischemia]] and muscle contractions. Spiral arteries in the secretory endometrium constrict, resulting in ischemia to the secretory endometrium. This allows the uterine lining to slough off.  The myometrium contracts spasmodically in order to push the menstrual fluid through the cervix and out of the vagina. The contractions are mediated by a release of [[prostaglandins]].

Painful menstrual cramps that result from an excess of prostaglandin release are referred to as primary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea usually begins within a year or two of menarche, typically with the onset of ovulatory cycles.&lt;ref name="merckmanuals.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/menstrual-abnormalities/dysmenorrhea?qt=dysmenorrhea+&amp;alt=sh|title=Dysmenorrhea - Gynecology and Obstetrics|website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910233709/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/menstrual-abnormalities/dysmenorrhea?qt=dysmenorrhea+&amp;alt=sh|archive-date=10 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatments that target the mechanism of pain include [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) and hormonal contraceptives. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin production. With long-term treatment, hormonal birth control reduces the amount of uterine fluid/tissue expelled from the uterus. Thus resulting in shorter, less painful menstruation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller L, Notter KM | title = Menstrual reduction with extended use of combination oral contraceptive pills: randomized controlled trial | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 98 | issue = 5 Pt 1 | pages = 771–8 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11704167 | url = http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2001/11000/Menstrual_Reduction_With_Extended_Use_of.11.aspx | publisher = LWW Journals | df = dmy-all | deadurl = no | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131109161456/http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2001/11000/Menstrual_Reduction_With_Extended_Use_of.11.aspx | archive-date = 9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These drugs are typically more effective than treatments that do not target the source of the pain (e.g. acetaminophen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marjoribanks J, Ayeleke RO, Farquhar C, Proctor M | title = Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for dysmenorrhoea | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 7 | pages = CD001751 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26224322 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors for primary dysmenorrhea include: early age at menarche, long or heavy menstrual periods, smoking, and a family history of dysmenorrhea.&lt;ref name="merckmanuals.com"/&gt; Regular physical activity may limit the severity of uterine cramps.&lt;ref name="merckmanuals.com"/&gt;

For many women, primary dysmenorrhea gradually subsides in late second generation. Pregnancy has also been demonstrated to lessen the severity of dysmenorrhea, when menstruation resumes.  However, dysmenorrhea can continue until [[menopause]]. 5–15% of women with dysmenorrhea experience symptoms severe enough to interfere with daily activities.&lt;ref name="merckmanuals.com"/&gt;

[[Secondary dysmenorrhea]] is the diagnosis given when menstruation pain is a secondary cause to another disorder. Conditions causing secondary dysmenorrhea include [[endometriosis]], [[uterine fibroids]], and uterine adenomyosis. Rarely, congenital malformations, [[intrauterine devices]], certain cancers, and pelvic infections cause secondary dysmenorrhea.&lt;ref name="merckmanuals.com"/&gt; Symptoms include pain spreading to hips, lower back and thighs, nausea, and frequent diarrhea or constipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/09/25/healthmag.period.makeover/index.html?iref=mpstoryview | work=CNN | title=Period makeovers: Fixes for heavy bleeding, cramps, PMS - CNN.com | date=25 September 2007 | deadurl=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626134528/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/09/25/healthmag.period.makeover/index.html?iref=mpstoryview | archive-date=26 June 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the pain occurs between menstrual periods, lasts longer than the first few days of the period, or is not adequately relieved by the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or hormonal contraceptives, women should be evaluated for secondary causes of dysmenorrhea.&lt;ref name=isbn_0674013433 /&gt;{{rp|p. 379}}

When severe pelvic pain and bleeding suddenly occur or worsen during a cycle, the woman or girl should be evaluated for [[ectopic pregnancy]] and [[miscarriage|spontaneous abortion]]. This evaluation begins with a pregnancy test and should be done as soon as unusual pain begins, because ectopic pregnancies can be life‑threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2041923-clinical|title=Ectopic Pregnancy Clinical Presentation: History, Physical Examination|website=emedicine.medscape.com|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329020606/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2041923-clinical|archive-date=29 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, stronger physical and emotional or psychological sensations may interfere with normal activities, and include menstrual [[pain]] ([[dysmenorrhea]]), [[migraine]] headaches, and depression. [[Dysmenorrhea]], or severe uterine pain, is particularly common for young females (one study found that 67.2% of girls aged 13–19 have it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma P, Malhotra C, Taneja DK, Saha R | title = Problems related to menstruation amongst adolescent girls | journal = Indian Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–9 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18334791 | doi = 10.1007/s12098-008-0018-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medications in the [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) class are commonly used to relieve menstrual cramps. Some herbs are also claimed to help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gayle|first1=A. Alleman| name-list-format = vanc |title=Herbal Remedies for Menstruation|url=https://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/natural-medicine/herbal-remedies/herbal-remedies-for-menstruation.htm|website=howstuffworks|access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mood and behavior===
Some women experience emotional disturbances starting one or two weeks before their period, and stopping soon after the period has started.&lt;ref name=Women2014PMS/&gt; Symptoms may include  mental tension, [[irritability]], [[mood swings]], and crying spells. Problems with concentration and memory may occur.&lt;ref name=Women2014PMS/&gt; There may also be [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name=Women2014PMS/&gt;

This is part of [[premenstrual syndrome]] (PMS) and is estimated to occur in 20 to 30% of women.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt; --&gt; In 3 to 8% it is severe.&lt;ref name="AFP2011" /&gt;

More severe symptoms of anxiety or depression may be signs of [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] (PMDD). Rarely, in individuals who are susceptible, menstruation may be a trigger for [[menstrual psychosis]].

Extreme psychological stress can also result in periods stopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meczekalski B, Katulski K, Czyzyk A, Podfigurna-Stopa A, Maciejewska-Jeske M | title = Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and its influence on women's health | journal = Journal of Endocrinological Investigation | volume = 37 | issue = 11 | pages = 1049–56 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25201001 | pmc = 4207953 | doi = 10.1007/s40618-014-0169-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bleeding===
The average volume of menstrual fluid during a monthly menstrual period is 35 milliliters (2.4 tablespoons of menstrual fluid) with 10–80 milliliters (1–6 tablespoons of menstrual fluid) considered typical. Menstrual fluid is the correct name for the flow, although many people prefer to refer to it as menstrual blood. Menstrual fluid contains some blood, as well as cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and [[Endometrium|endometrial tissue]]. Menstrual fluid is reddish-brown, a slightly darker color than venous blood.&lt;ref name=isbn_0674013433 /&gt;{{rp|p. 381}}

About half of menstrual fluid is blood. This blood contains sodium, calcium, phosphate, iron, and chloride, the extent of which depends on the woman. As well as blood, the fluid consists of cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue. Vaginal fluids in menses mainly contribute water, common electrolytes, organ moieties, and at least 14 proteins, including glycoproteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farage |first=Miranda | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Vulva: Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathology|date=22 Mar 2013|publisher=CRC Press|pages=155–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mature females notice blood clots during menstruation. These appear as clumps of blood that may look like tissue. If there are questions (for example, was there a miscarriage?), examination under a microscope can confirm if it was endometrial tissue or pregnancy tissue (products of conception) that was shed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menstrual blood problems: Clots, color and thickness|url=http://women.webmd.com/menstrual-blood-problems-clots-color-and-thickness|publisher=WebMD|access-date=20 September 2011|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923151848/http://women.webmd.com/menstrual-blood-problems-clots-color-and-thickness|archive-date=23 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes menstrual clots or shed endometrial tissue is incorrectly thought to indicate an early-term miscarriage of an embryo. An [[enzyme]] called [[plasmin]] – contained in the endometrium – tends to inhibit the blood from [[blood clotting|clotting]].

The amount of iron lost in menstrual fluid is relatively small for most women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iron-deficiency is not something you get just for being a lady |author=[http://www.anthro.illinois.edu/people/kclancy Clancy, Kate] |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/2011/07/27/iron-deficiency-anemia/ |publisher=SciAm |date=27 July 2011 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317152812/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/2011/07/27/iron-deficiency-anemia/ |archive-date=17 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, premenopausal women who exhibited symptoms of [[iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]] were given endoscopies. 86% of them actually had [[gastrointestinal disease]] and were at risk of being misdiagnosed simply because they were menstruating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kepczyk T, Cremins JE, Long BD, Bachinski MB, Smith LR, McNally PR | title = A prospective, multidisciplinary evaluation of premenopausal women with iron-deficiency anemia | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 109–15 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9934740 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.1999.00780.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy menstrual bleeding, occurring monthly, can result in anemia.

===Menstrual disorders===
There is a wide spectrum of differences in how women experience menstruation. There are several ways that someone's menstrual cycle can differ from the norm, any of which should be discussed with a doctor to identify the underlying cause:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Symptom !! See article
|-
| Infrequent periods || [[Oligomenorrhea]]
|-
| Short or extremely light periods || [[Hypomenorrhea]]
|-
| Too-frequent periods (defined as more frequently than every 21 days) || [[Polymenorrhea]]
|-
| Extremely heavy or long periods (one guideline is soaking a [[sanitary napkin]] or [[tampon]] every hour or so, or menstruating for longer than 7 days) || [[Hypermenorrhea]]
|-
| Extremely painful periods ||  [[Dysmenorrhea]]
|-
| Breakthrough bleeding (also called spotting) between periods; normal in many females|| [[Metrorrhagia]]
|-
| Absent periods ||  [[Amenorrhea]]
|}
There is a movement among gynecologists to discard the terms noted above, which although they are widely used, do not have precise definitions.  Many now argue to describe menstruation in simple terminology, including:
* Cycle regularity (irregular, regular, or absent)
* Frequency of menstruation (frequent, normal, or infrequent)
* Duration of menstrual flow (prolonged, normal, or shortened)
* Volume of menstrual flow (heavy, normal, or light)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraser IS, Critchley HO, Munro MG, Broder M | title = Can we achieve international agreement on terminologies and definitions used to describe abnormalities of menstrual bleeding? | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 635–43 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17204526 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/del478 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dysfunctional uterine bleeding]] is a hormonally caused bleeding abnormality.  Dysfunctional uterine bleeding typically occurs in premenopausal women who do not ovulate normally (i.e. are [[anovulatory]]). All these bleeding abnormalities need medical attention; they may indicate hormone imbalances, uterine fibroids, or other problems. As pregnant women may bleed, a [[pregnancy test]] forms part of the evaluation of abnormal bleeding.

Women who had undergone [[female genital mutilation]] (particularly type III- [[infibulation]])  a practice common in parts of [[Africa]], may experience menstrual problems, such as slow and painful menstruation, that is caused by the near-complete sealing off of the vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/health_consequences_fgm/en/|title=Health risks of female genital mutilation (FGM)|website=World Health Organization|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035132/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/health_consequences_fgm/en/|archive-date=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Premature or delayed menarche should be investigated if menarche begins before 9 years, if menarche has not begun by age 15, if there is no breast development by age 13, or if there is no period by 3 years after the onset of breast development.&lt;ref name=Diaz2006/&gt;

===Sexual activity===
[[Sexual intercourse]] during menstruation does not cause damage in and of itself, but the woman's body is more vulnerable during this time. Vaginal pH is higher and thus less acidic than normal,&lt;ref name="pmid6807162"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner G, Ottesen B | title = Vaginal physiology during menstruation | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 96 | issue = 6 Pt 2 | pages = 921–3 | date = June 1982 | pmid = 6807162 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the cervix is lower in its position, the cervical opening is more dilated, and the uterine endometrial lining is absent, thus allowing organisms direct access to the bloodstream through the numerous blood vessels that nourish the uterus. All these conditions increase the chance of infection during menstruation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wBvyCAAAQBAJ|title=Estrogens and Antiestrogens II: Pharmacology and Clinical Application of Estrogens and Antiestrogen|last1=Oettel|first1=Michael|last2=Schillinger|first2=Ekkehard | name-list-format = vanc |date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783642601071|pages=355|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116194446/https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wBvyCAAAQBAJ|archive-date=16 January 2017|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ovulation suppression==

===Birth control===
{{main|Hormonal contraception}}
[[File:pillpacketopen.jpg|thumb|right|Half-used blister pack of a combined oral contraceptive. The white pills are [[placebos]], mainly for the purpose of reminding the woman to continue taking the pills.]]
Since the late 1960s, many women have chosen to control the frequency of menstruation with [[hormonal contraception|hormonal birth control pills]].  They are most often combined hormone pills containing [[estrogen]] and are taken in 28-day cycles, 21 hormonal pills with either a 7-day break from pills, or 7 placebo pills during which the woman menstruates. Hormonal birth control acts by using low doses of hormones to prevent ovulation, and thus prevent pregnancy in sexually active women. But by using placebo pills for a 7-day span during the month, a regular bleeding period is still experienced.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Injections such as [[depo-provera]] became available in the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Progestogen implants such as [[Norplant]] in the 1980s and [[extended cycle combined oral contraceptive pill]]s in the early 2000s.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Using synthetic hormones, it is possible for a woman to completely eliminate menstrual periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delaying your period with birth control pills|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/womens-health/WO00069|publisher=Mayo Clinic|access-date=20 September 2011|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926085226/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/womens-health/WO00069|archive-date=26 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using progestogen implants, menstruation may be reduced to 3 or 4 menstrual periods per year. By taking progestogen-only contraceptive pills (sometimes called the 'mini-pill') continuously without a 7-day span of using placebo pills, menstrual periods do not occur. Some women do this simply for convenience in the short-term,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How can I delay my period while on holiday?|url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/830.aspx?CategoryID=60&amp;SubCategoryID=179|publisher=National Health Service, United Kingdom|access-date=20 September 2011|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805003602/http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/830.aspx?CategoryID=60&amp;SubCategoryID=179|archive-date=5 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others prefer to eliminate periods altogether when possible.

Some women use hormonal contraception in this way to eliminate their periods for months or years at a time, a practice called [[menstrual suppression]]. When the first birth control pill was being developed, the researchers were aware that they could use the contraceptive to space menstrual periods up to 90 days apart, but they settled on a 28-day cycle that would mimic a natural menstrual cycle and produce monthly periods.  The intention behind this decision was the hope of the inventor, John Rock, to win approval for his invention from the Roman Catholic Church. That attempt failed, but the 28-day cycle remained the standard when the pill became available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do you really need to have a period every month?|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/human-biology/monthly-period2.htm|publisher=Discovery Health|access-date=20 September 2011|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208020920/http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/human-biology/monthly-period2.htm|archive-date=8 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate among medical researchers about the potential long-term impacts of these practices upon female health. Some researchers point to the fact that historically, females have had far fewer menstrual periods throughout their lifetimes, a result of shorter life expectancies, as well as a greater length of time spent pregnant or breast-feeding, which reduced the number of periods experienced by females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Amy | last1 = Lind |first2 = Stephanie | last2 = Brzuzy | name-list-format = vanc |title=Battleground: Women, Gender, and Sexuality: Volume 2: M–Z|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-34039-0|page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers believe that the higher number of menstrual periods by females in modern societies may have a negative impact upon their health. On the other hand, some researchers believe there is a greater potential for negative impacts from exposing females perhaps unnecessarily to regular low doses of synthetic hormones over their reproductive years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kam|first=Katherine| name-list-format = vanc |title=Eliminate periods with birth control?|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/features/no-more-periods|publisher=WebMD|access-date=20 September 2011|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902083010/http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/features/no-more-periods|archive-date=2 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breastfeeding ===
{{main|Lactational amenorrhea}}
[[Breastfeeding]] causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending on the strength of the negative feedback, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, follicular development but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycles may resume.&lt;ref name="mcneilly"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McNeilly AS | title = Lactational control of reproduction | journal = Reproduction, Fertility, and Development | volume = 13 | issue = 7-8 | pages = 583–90 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11999309 | doi = 10.1071/RD01056 | url = http://www.publish.csiro.au/journals/abstractHTML.cfm?J=RD&amp;V=13&amp;I=8&amp;F=RD01056abs.XML | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030529233346/http://www.publish.csiro.au/journals/abstractHTML.cfm?J=RD&amp;V=13&amp;I=8&amp;F=RD01056abs.XML | df = dmy-all | deadurl = no | archive-date = 29 May 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book | first=John | last=Kippley | first2 = Sheila | last2 = Kippley | name-list-format = vanc | year=1996 | title=The Art of Natural Family Planning | edition=4th | publisher=The Couple to Couple League | location=Cincinnati, OH | isbn=0-926412-13-2 | page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of [[prolactin]] in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stallings JF, Worthman CM, Panter-Brick C, Coates RJ | title = Prolactin response to suckling and maintenance of postpartum amenorrhea among intensively breastfeeding Nepali women | journal = Endocrine Research | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–28 | date = February 1996 | pmid = 8690004 | doi = 10.3109/07435809609030495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum.

==Menstrual management==

{{Main|Feminine hygiene}}

{{Further|Menstrual hygiene day}}
Menstruation is managed by menstruating women to avoid damage to clothing or to accord with norms of public life. Menstrual management practices range from medical suppression of menstruation, through wearing special garments or other items, washing or avoidance of washing, disposal and laundry of stained materials, to separation of menstruators to particular places or activities.

Menstrual products (also called "[[feminine hygiene]]" products) are made to absorb or catch menstrual blood. A number of different products are available - some are disposable, some are reusable. Where women can afford it, items used to absorb or catch menses are usually commercially manufactured products.

There are disposable products:

|6=Disposable [[sanitary napkin]]
|7=[[Tampon]] in plastic applicator
|8=Disposable sanitary napkin
|9=Tampon in plastic applicator}}

*[[Sanitary napkin]]s (also called sanitary towels or pads) – Rectangular pieces of material worn attached to the underwear to absorb menstrual flow, often with an adhesive backing to hold the pad in place. Disposable pads may contain [[wood pulp]] or [[gel]] products, usually with a plastic lining and bleached.
*[[Tampon]]s – Disposable cylinders of treated [[rayon]]/cotton blends or all-cotton fleece, usually bleached, that are inserted into the vagina to absorb menstrual flow.
* Disposable [[menstrual cups]] made of soft plastic – A firm, flexible cup-shaped device worn inside the vagina to collect menstrual flow.

Reusable products include:

|7=[[Cloth menstrual pad]]
|8=Menstrual cup
|9=Cloth menstrual pad}}

*[[Menstrual cup]]s – A firm, flexible bell-shaped device worn inside the vagina to collect menstrual flow. Menstrual cups are usually made of silicone and can last 5 years or longer.
*[[Cloth menstrual pad|Reusable cloth pads]] – Pads that are made of cotton (often [[organic farming|organic]]), [[terrycloth]], or [[flannel]], and may be handsewn (from material or reused old clothes and towels) or storebought.
* Padded panties or period-proof underwear – Reusable cloth (usually cotton) [[undergarment|underwear]] with extra absorbent layers sewn in to absorb flow. Some also use patented technology to be leak resistant, such as the brand [[THINX]].
*[[Sea sponge]]s – Natural sponges, worn internally like a tampon to absorb menstrual flow.
*[[Blanket]], [[towel]] – (also known as a [[draw sheet]]) – large reusable piece of cloth, most often used at night, placed between legs to absorb menstrual flow.

In [[developing countries]], many poor women cannot afford commercial feminine hygiene products. Instead, they use materials found in the environment or other improvised materials. Absorption materials that may be used by women who cannot afford anything else include: sand, ash, small hole in earth,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; cloth, whole leaf, leaf fibre (such as [[water hyacinth]], banana, [[papyrus]], cotton fibre), paper (toilet paper, re-used newspaper, pulped and dried paper),&lt;ref&gt;House, S., Mahon, T., Cavill, S.

=== Traditions, taboos and education===
{{Main|Culture and menstruation}}

Many religions have menstruation-related traditions, for example: Islam prohibits sexual contact with women during menstruation in the 2nd chapter of the [[Quran]]. Scholars argue that menstruating women are in a state in which they are unable to maintain [[wudhu]], and are therefore prohibited from touching the Arabic version of the Qur'an. Other biological and involuntary functions such as vomiting, bleeding, sexual intercourse, and going to the bathroom also invalidate one's wudhu.&lt;ref name="ahadith"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ahadith.co.uk/chapter.php?cid=28|title=Sahih Bukhari, Chapter: 6, Menstrual Periods }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Judaism]], a woman during menstruation is called [[Niddah]] and may be banned from certain actions. For example, the Jewish [[Torah]] prohibits sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 15:19-30, 18:19, 20:18&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hinduism]], menstruating women are traditionally considered ritually impure and given rules to follow. During menstruation, women are not allowed to “enter the kitchen and temples", wear flowers, have sex, touch other males or females.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Menstruation, Religion and Society|last = Bhartiya|first = Aru | name-list-format = vanc |date = November 2013|journal = International Journal of Social Science and Humanity|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western culture|Western civilization]], which has been predominantly Christian, has a history of menstrual [[taboos]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Most [[female mammals]] have an [[estrous cycle]], yet only ten primates species, four [[Chiroptera|bats]] species, the [[elephant shrew]], and the [[spiny mouse]] have a menstrual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why do women menstruate? | work = ScienceBlogs | year = 2011 | url = http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/12/21/why-do-women-menstruate/ | access-date = 15 January 2013 | deadurl = no | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130127131136/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/12/21/why-do-women-menstruate/ | archive-date = 27 January 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellofiore N, Ellery SJ, Mamrot J, Walker DW, Temple-Smith P, Dickinson H | title = First evidence of a menstruating rodent: the spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus) | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 216 | issue = 1 | pages = 40.e1-40.e11 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27503621 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2016.07.041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relatedness of these groups suggests that four distinct evolutionary events have caused menstruation to arise.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Emera D, Romero R, Wagner G | title = The evolution of menstruation: a new model for genetic assimilation: explaining molecular origins of maternal responses to fetal invasiveness | journal = BioEssays | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–35 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22057551 | pmc = 3528014 | doi = 10.1002/bies.201100099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some anthropologists have questioned the energy cost of rebuilding the [[endometrium]] every fertility cycle. It has proposed that the energy savings of not having to continuously maintain the uterine lining more than offsets energy cost of having to rebuild the lining in the next fertility cycle, even in species such as humans where much of the lining is lost through bleeding (overt menstruation) rather than reabsorbed (covert menstruation).&lt;ref name="pmid_8693059"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strassmann BI | title = The evolution of endometrial cycles and menstruation | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–220 | date = June 1996 | pmid = 8693059 | doi = 10.1086/419369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obsolete"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Kathleen O'Grady | title = Is Menstruation Obsolete? | publisher = The Canadian Women's Health Network | year = 2000 | url = http://www.cwhn.ca/resources/menstruation/obsolete.html | access-date = 21 January 2007 | authorlink = Kathleen O'Grady | deadurl = no | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070213102822/http://www.cwhn.ca/resources/menstruation/obsolete.html | archive-date = 13 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have questioned the evolution of overt menstruation in humans and related species, speculating on what advantage there could be to losing blood associated with dismantling the endometrium, rather than absorbing it, as most mammals do.  Humans do, in fact, reabsorb about two-thirds of the endometrium each cycle. Some work asserts that overt menstruation occurs not because it is beneficial in itself.  Rather, the fetal development of these species requires a more developed endometrium, one which is too thick to reabsorb completely. There is a correlation between species that have overt menstruation to those that have a large uterus relative to the adult female body size.&lt;ref name="pmid_8693059" /&gt;

Recent reviews suggest that menstruation itself is not an evolved, adaptive trait. Rather, it is an inherent consequence of spontaneous [[decidualization]] evolving as a derived trait from non-spontaneous decidualization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[grandmother hypothesis]] is a hypothesis to explain the existence of [[menopause]] in human life history by identifying the adaptive value of extended kin networking.

Beginning in 1971, some research suggested that menstrual cycles of cohabiting human females became synchronized ([[menstrual synchrony]]). However, there is currently significant dispute as to whether menstrual synchrony exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Adams | first = Cecil | authorlink = Cecil Adams | title = Does menstrual synchrony really exist? | work = The Straight Dope | publisher = The Chicago Reader | date = 20 December 2002 | url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2429/does-menstrual-synchrony-really-exist | access-date = 10 January 2007 | deadurl = no | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080915110257/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2429/does-menstrual-synchrony-really-exist | archive-date = 15 September 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 review concluded that menstrual synchrony likely does not exist.&lt;ref name=Harris2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris AL, Vitzthum VJ | title = Darwin's legacy: an evolutionary view of women's reproductive and sexual functioning | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 50 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 207–46 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23480070 | doi = 10.1080/00224499.2012.763085 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Speir Gunn''' (31 August 1862 – 18 October 1913) was murdered in a shooting attack at the isolated Northbank Cottage near [[Portencross]] in [[North Ayrshire]], Scotland on the evening of Saturday, 18 October 1913. Six shots were fired through the living-room window at night. Three shots struck Mary Gunn, the fatal one piercing her heart. Two shots hit her sister '''Jessie McLaren''', who collapsed with a bullet lodged in her back, but she survived the attack. Jessie's husband, '''Alexander McLaren''', was injured in the index finger of his left hand.{{sfn|Love|2003|p=29}}{{sfn|Kellie|2013|p=163}}

Newspapers described the murder at the time as "a terrible and most mysterious tragedy".{{sfn|''Ardrossan &amp; Saltcoats Herald''|2013}} Nobody was charged or prosecuted for the crime, which remains an unsolved murder.

== Mary Gunn ==
Mary Speir Gunn was born in [[Stevenston]] in [[North Ayrshire]] to parents Jane Speir of [[Dalry, North Ayrshire|Dalry]] and Gilbert Gunn of [[Gateside, North Ayrshire|Gateside]]. Mary was one of three sisters and her father was a well known railway contractor and was said to be one of Scotland's strongest men.{{sfn|House|1984|p=124}} In 1881 and 1891 Mary was living in [[Beith]] at Burnside and was said to be very good looking, the Burnsian style sobriquet "Beauty of Beith"{{sfn|Hodgkinson|2002|p=111}} accurately describing her. In 1891 she is recorded to have had the then unusual occupation of "telephone operator", indeed being the town's first in 1883;{{sfn|Soulsearchers}}{{sfn|Ayrshire Roots}}
she later worked at [[Ardrossan]] in the same capacity.{{sfn|House|1984|p=124}}

In 1901 Mary was working for and living in [[Wigtownshire]] with her brother-in-law Alexander McLaren, then aged 48, a self-employed baker, his wife and Mary's sister Jessie, also aged 48, and Jane Speir Gunn, aged 83, Mary's mother.  This and other supporting information has been supplied via David R Craig's family tree.{{sfn|Ayrshire Roots}}
Alexander had run the [[Glengarnock]] Iron and Steel Company Store before moving to [[Port William, Scotland|Port William]] in [[Wigtownshire]].{{sfn|House|1984|p=124}} Alexander built an evangelistic Ebenezer Hall at Port William which he operated and was also on the school board. Alexander was offered the post office at [[Taynuilt]] and moved there with his wife before moving into farming and then retiring to Portencross.{{sfn|House|1984|p=124}}

Mary had stayed at Port William to tie up the family affairs and when she joined them in Taynuilt she found that she was just expected to work on the farm. Mary's middle sister lived in Canada with her husband John Craig{{sfn|Kellie|2013|p=161}} and Mary decided to accept her invitation to join them,{{sfn|House|1984|p=125}} however despite a promising love affair she was back at Taynuilt before long. Her romantic interlude in [[Saskatchewan]] was not found to have any link to her murder.{{sfn|House|1984|p=125}} In 1913 at the age of 51 Mary was living at the remote and inaccessible Northbank Cottage, an old farm situated beneath the precipitous red sandstone cliffs on the raised beach near [[Portencross]] with her sister Jessie and brother-in-law Alex.

==Background==
Alexander McLaren and his wife Jessie and Mary Gunn were not locals and had only moved in during the month of May 1913.{{sfn|River Clyde Photography}}
Alexander had been a self-employed baker, a farmer and something of an evangelist. He was sixty at the time of the murder and his wife Jessie was sixty-one whilst Mary was only forty-nine and still very good looking.{{sfn|House|1984|p=115}} The family had kept to themselves and were regarded locally as being quite well off.{{sfn|House|1984|p=122}} Alexander had recently sold the sheep from his old [[Taynuilt]] farm at a [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] auction and therefore had £100 that a potential thief may have thought was held as cash by him at Northbank Cottage.{{sfn|House|1984|p=123}}

On the day of the murder Mary went shopping in [[West Kilbride]], Alexander walked out to meet her on her return journey and they met a rather nondescript stranger who they walked and talked with.{{sfn|House|1984|p=123}}

== The murder ==
[[File:Northbank Farm, Portencross.JPG|Northbank Cottage|thumb|300px]]
On the dark, wet and stormy evening of Saturday 18 October 1913 the family were relaxing in front of an open fire in the parlour with only an oil lamp throwing a low light over the room. The two ladies were knitting and Alexander was reading aloud from a book, ''At Sunwich Port'' by [[W. W. Jacobs]]{{sfn|Kellie|2013|p=161}} with his back to the only window in the room.{{sfn|House|1984|p=116}} Suddenly at around 8.30pm{{sfn|Soulsearchers}} a pistol shot rang out, followed by five more shots. Mary cried out "Alex I'm shot" and collapsed with three bullet wounds, the fatal one piercing her heart. Alexander had time to shout to his wife " ''Floor, Floor'' ";{{sfn|House|1984|p=116}} however, Jessie was then hit by two bullets and Alex, shot first, had a wound to the hand, penetrating his left index finger to the bone,{{sfn|Soulsearchers}} made when the bullet passed through the book he was reading, throwing it to the floor.{{sfn|Love|2003|p=29}} At least one fired bullet was found lying outside the broken window,{{sfn|River Clyde Photography}}{{sfn|House|1984|p=118}} having ricocheted off the stone walls, and two bullets were also removed from the chair in which Alexander had been seated that night.{{sfn|House|1984|p=121}}

Alexander, not aware that he had been shot at first, leapt to his feet, pushing his wife to the floor and then rushing out to release his [[collie]] and eight-month-old [[Scottish Terrier|Scottish terrier]] pup{{sfn|Kellie|2013|p=163}} from an outhouse in an effort to catch the murderer.{{sfn|House|1984|p=116}} However, he found nothing and only three sets of footprints and one or more used bullets were found as evidence of the act. The footprints did not match Alexander's boots.{{sfn|House|1984|p=119}}

== Aftermath ==
Having no phone in the house Alex ran first to the farm of Alexander Murray at Portencross{{sfn|House|1984|p=118}} where he informed them of the attacks and then ran to the nearby mansion house of Auchenames at [[Portencross]] where the laird, William Adams,{{sfn|Kellie|2013|p=163}} had a phone and the Police and a doctor were quickly on the scene, arriving by taxi, although oddly the Police had no phone and a friend of the laird in [[West Kilbride]] had to knock on the Police Station door and pass on the news.{{sfn|Kellie|2013|p=163}} Mary was dead and Jessie had a bullet removed from her back by the doctor.{{sfn|House|1984|p=118}} Alexander was taken to West Kilbride Police Station where, suffering from shock, he did his best to recount the happenings of the incident.{{sfn|House|1984|p=118}}

The gun was found through the calibre of the shell case to be a heavy army revolver of the [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt-type]]{{sfn|House|1984|p=119}}, however it was never located and may have been disposed of in the sea.{{sfn|Soulsearchers}} Mrs Jessie MacLaren was treated at the [[Kilmarnock]] Infirmary and was only released in January 1914. The [[Southern Necropolis]] in Glasgow is the final resting place of Mary Speir Gunn, interred wearing her favourite plaid.{{sfn|Soulsearchers}}

Plaster casts were made of the six footprints and enquiries revealed that an unidentified man had recently been to three farms in the locality seeking directions to Portencross, a fact corroborated by a group of local schoolchildren.{{sfn|Kellie|2013|p=165}} It was odd that the dogs in their nearby outhouse had not barked as they usually would have at the occasional passing stranger and the revolver was fired at an acute angle through the window as if the perpetrator was afraid that he would be recognised as someone known to the victims.

The police made extensive enquiries but to no avail, investigating links as far away as [[Saskatchewan]] in Canada where Mary Gunn had a boyfriend.{{sfn|River Clyde Photography}} One Police theory was that the murderer committed suicide by drowning, an unsuccessful watch was kept for a body and the Ardneil Woods were searched without success.{{sfn|House|1984|p=122}}{{sfn|''The Standard'' 27 Oct|1913|p=9}}
All reports of the Police involvement emphasise how thorough the investigation was.{{sfn|Kellie|2013|p=163}}

Jessie McLaren recovered from superficial wounds to a kidney, but Mary of course had died at the scene. It was thought that the murderer had targeted Alexander as the intended victim.

Alexander McLaren stated that he had no idea what the motive was as he had no disputes with anyone and a robbery "gone wrong" seemed unlikely. A £100 reward was offered but no one came forward.{{sfn|House|1984|p=129}}

A legal action against Alexander was brought by Mrs Elizabeth Walker or Gibson, the keeper of the boarding house at Portencross in 1915 who claimed that her business had suffered badly following accusations from Alexander that she knew something about the murder or had been somehow involved, however the complainant dropped the action and had to pay her own costs.{{sfn|House|1984|p=130}}

Alexander and Jessie left Northbank Cottage and seem to have moved to Garnock Street in [[Dalry, North Ayrshire|Dalry]], possibly living with a friend.{{sfn|House|1984|p=130}} Despite the trauma of the event and its aftermath they remained together.{{sfn|Kellie|2013|p=166}}

The trail went cold and the multiple attack and murder, together with the motive behind the shootings, remain an unsolved mystery to this day.

Jack House speculates that Alexander was the perpetrator of the crime and his wife corroborated his version through being in shock at the time.{{sfn|House|1984|p=133}}

==Micro-history==
It was thought by some that Alexander was involved in the murder as he hoped to marry the marginally younger and more attractive Mary, however given their respective ages this seems unlikely given average lifespan at the time.{{sfn|Love|2003|p=30}} At the time it was certainly unusual for an attractive woman to remain unmarried and to live with her sister and brother-in-law for so many years.

The author Jack House described the murder in his book ''Murder Not Proven''.{{sfn|Hodgkinson|2002|p=111}}

Postcards were sold showing Northbank Cottage with a policeman standing on guard duty outside{{sfn|Hodgkinson|2002|p=111}} and sold in thousands.

Mary was the granddaughter of Margaret Gibson Spier who established [[Spier's school]] at Beith.

'''Nasrat Parsa''' ({{lang-fa|نصرت پارسا}}, February 22, 1968 &amp;ndash; May 8, 2005) was a popular [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] singer. Up until his murder, he continued his music in exile from [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], occasionally touring other countries.

==Personal life==

===Background===
Nasrat Ali Parsa was born in a suburb of [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]]. His family, especially his oldest brother Najibullah Parsa, was already involved in music to a certain extent and the environment of a musical household helped materialize Nasrat’s artistic talents. According to Nasrat's personal account, he was first discovered after singing the songs of [[Ahmad Zahir]] on a national radio broadcast. After the singer heard the renditions of his songs by the 7 year old Nasrat, he got in touch with the child and invited him to sing with him. Thus was Nasrat’s formal initiation into singing.

=== Emigration to India ===
Due to [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet occupation of Afghanistan]] and the ensuing disruptive guerrilla fighting, Nasrat Parsa and his family left Afghanistan in 1981 for [[Pakistan]] and subsequently to [[India]]. They took residence in the capital city of [[New Delhi]], a [[Refugees in India#Afghan refugees|popular destination]] for most war civilians. There, the 12-year-old Nasrat was said to delve into studying music to find comfort from the negative psychological effects of the war. He attended the school of music under the apprenticeship of classic Indian singer [[Daish Pandi]]. Although the classical music of Afghanistan and [[Indian classical music]] differ a bit in tone and rhythm, the training nonetheless gave Nasrat a foundation to prepare his voice and gave encouragement to the amateur to pursue his interest professionally. He also studied with [[Ustad Munawar Ali Khan]], a leading authority in certain [[Music of India|Indian music]] styles who taught him details of musical instruments and notes. It was these lessons that would prepare him for performing the [[ghazal]] that he later became known for in Europe.

===Immigration to Germany===
After a few transition years in India, Nasrat and his family immigrated to [[Germany]]. Establishing contact with other fellow countrymen in [[Hamburg]], Nasrat became more involved in the music scene with the other exiled singers and musicians. There, he taught Waly Hedjasi, better known as VALY, a highly acclaimed musician.

From his initial involvements in private parties to the formal weddings where strong singing background is considered, Nasrat's name ranked high on the choice list. At this time, he started working on recording professional albums as well. His initial works met with moderate notability; however, they were commercially steady in success.

At weddings he was acclaimed for the warm welcoming of the bride and groom with his number ''[[Maa Destmal Aawordaim]]'' (''ما دستمال آورديم '') (''Gohar'' Album) which roughly translates as “we‘ve brought our brother’s bride.”  This album established Nasrat as a respected singer and also garnered him praise of critics. As a matter of fact, the monumentalizing of the bride and groom union following the entrance anthem of ''[[Ahesta Boro]]'' (''آهسته برو'') in weddings with the hit song of the ''Gohar'' Album is now a strong tradition of Afghan weddings.

His performances hereon became regular, and he often teamed with other singers to perform in various cities outside of Germany.

==Death==
On May 7, 2005, Nasrat Parsa performed a concert in [[Vancouver]], Canada, on the occasion of [[Mother's Day]], opening a comprehensive tour that was scheduled to include several cities in [[North America]]. At the height of his popularity, and on the occasion of promoting his upcoming album ''Dil'', the singer flew to Canada where he performed to a large crowd of fans, some of whom saw him live on stage for the first time.

During a break on his concert, Nasrat was approached by a group of 3 young men claiming to be his fans. They asked him, aggressively, if he would sing more upbeat songs. He stated to them that he could not because he was not prepared to perform such songs. The singer maintained his composure and was respectful to the attending mothers who came to his concert on the occasion of Mother's Day.

After the end of the concert, Nasrat was with his brother, Najib Parsa. At that moment, the three young men returned, and they asked the singer's autograph and to make a picture with him. One of the infuriated men, dissatisfied with the justification, punched the singer in the face. This caused him to slump in shock and lose his balance. Nasrat fell down a flight of stairs, hitting his head on one of the concrete cases, and became immediately unconscious.
 
The singer was brought to hospital, but failed to recover from his injuries. At 11:15pm on the following day, Nasrat Ali Parsa, 36, was pronounced dead at a Vancouver hospital.

===Sentence of offender===
The Hazara man who punched him was found guilty of [[manslaughter]] and given a conditional sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/090220/national/afghan_singer_sentence B.C. man will get no jail time in manslaughter death of Afghan pop star]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funerary services ===
On May 12, 2005, Nasrat Parsa’s body was flown back to Germany for burial. The grief-stricken bereaved family members and fans around the world individually held services to honor the singer. Notably, the funeral held at [[Sayed Jamaladen Masjid]] by [[Habib Qaderi]] on May 15, 2005 in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[United States]], drew thousands of sorrowful fans. Other cities, in the United States, Canada, [[Europe]], [[Australia]], and Afghanistan also held similar mourning sessions. His grave is situated in [[Frankfurt]], Germany in ''Mainzer Waldfriedhof''.

=== Laguna Beach vigil ===
On May 13, 2005, a candlelight vigil was held in memory of the singer in [[Laguna Beach]], [[United States]]. The event, which drew many fans and sympathizers, called for a conscious effort to respect all singers from Afghanistan. Furthermore, it called for active action against violence in future concert events to protect the other musical assets of Afghanistan. The vigil was held with an [[Islamic]] theme to honor his family’s religious tradition. Similar ceremonies were also held thereafter in various cities around the world in honor of the singer.

{{nihongo|'''Seisaku Nakamura'''|中村 誠策|Nakamura Seisaku|extra=c. 1924 – c. 1943}} was a [[Japan]]ese man convicted for [[serial killer|serial killings]] in his [[Adolescence|teenage years]].&lt;ref name="kanga"&gt;{{cite web | author= Eruo Kanga| script-title=ja:戦前の少年犯罪| publisher= | language=Japanese | url=http://kangaeru.s59.xrea.com/senzen.htm | date= | accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known as '''Hamamatsu Deaf Killer'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=serial killers by country - japan jp | publisher=serial killer true crime library | url=http://www.crimezzz.net//serialkiller_index/by_country/jp.php | date= | accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted of stabbing to death at least nine people, including several teenagers, in the [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. The book, {{nihongo|''Senzen no Shōnen Hanzai''|戦前の少年犯罪}}, which included the subject of the incident, was published in October 2007.&lt;ref name="Asahi Shimbun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/komimi/TKY200802010172.html|script-title=ja:異色の少年犯罪本、ネット発で好評|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]]|date=2008-02-09|accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Seisaku Nakamura was born deaf. He was intelligent, achieving high marks at school, but was treated poorly by his family and was a social misfit. He enjoyed films where men used [[Japanese sword]]s to [[assassinate]]  people.

== Murders ==
According to his testimony, on August 22, 1938,&lt;ref name="kanga" /&gt; he attempted to [[rape]] two women; they resisted him, so he murdered them. He was 14 years old at that time. However, the two murders are often excluded from his serial murders.

On August 18, 1941, at the age of 17, Seisaku Nakamura killed a third woman and injured a fourth. On August 20, 1941, three more people were found dead, murdered by Nakamura. On September 27, 1941, he murdered his brother, and injured his father, his sister, his brother's wife and his brother's child. On August 30, 1942, he murdered a couple, their daughter, and their son, and attempted to rape another daughter.&lt;ref name="kanga" /&gt;

Information about his crimes were restricted because many thought news about his crimes would cause excessive trouble during the already tense war time, so Nakamura went unapprehended for longer than he might have otherwise. His family knew that he was responsible for the deaths but were afraid of revenge and did not come forward.

== Arrest, trial, and execution ==
He was arrested for nine murders on October 12, 1942. He also admitted two others.&lt;ref name="kanga" /&gt; On November 11, his father {{nihongo|Fumisada Nakamura|中村 文貞|Nakamura Fumisada}} committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www004.upp.so-net.ne.jp/kuhiwo/dazai/db2.html|script-title=ja:自殺データベース 昭和前期の自殺 (1826-1969)|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-05-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223001020/http://www004.upp.so-net.ne.jp/kuhiwo/dazai/db2.html|archivedate=2008-12-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[tried as an adult]] under the {{nihongo|Wartime Law|戦時刑事特別法|Senji Keiji Tokubetsu Hō}}. The doctors claimed that he was [[insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]]. However, the trial proceeded rapidly and he was executed soon after.

The book, {{nihongo|''Senzen no Shōnen Hanzai''|戦前の少年犯罪||"Youth Crime in Prewar Japan"}} discussed the incident. It was published in October 2007.&lt;ref name="Asahi Shimbun"/&gt;

'''Slime mold''' or '''slime mould''' is an informal name given to several kinds of unrelated [[eukaryotic]] organisms that can live freely as single cells, but can aggregate together to form multicellular reproductive structures. Slime molds were formerly classified as [[fungi]] but are no longer considered part of that [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to the Slime Molds"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/slimemolds.html |title=Introduction to the "Slime Molds" |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not related to one another, they are still sometimes grouped for convenience within the [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group referred to as kingdom [[Protists|Protista]].

More than 900 species of slime mold occur all over the world. Their common name refers to part of some of these organisms' life cycles where they can appear as gelatinous "slime". This is mostly seen with the [[myxogastria]], which are the only macroscopic slime molds.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Most slime molds are smaller than a few centimeters, but some species may reach sizes of up to several square meters and masses of up to 30&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12026071 |title=Zinc accumulation by the slime mold ''Fuligo septica'' (L.) Wiggers in the former Soviet Union and North Korea |doi=10.2134/jeq2002.1038 |volume=31 |issue=3 |year=2002 |pages=1038–1042 |journal=Journal of Environment Quality |last1= Zhulidov |first1= DA |last2= Robarts |first2= RD |last3= Zhulidov |first3= AV |display-authors= 3 |last4= et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many slime molds, mainly the "cellular" slime molds, do not spend most of their time in this state. As long as food is abundant, these slime molds exist as single-celled organisms. When food is in short supply, many of these single-celled organisms will congregate and start moving as a single body. In this state they are sensitive to airborne chemicals and can detect food sources. They can readily change the shape and function of parts and may form stalks that produce fruiting bodies, releasing countless spores, light enough to be carried on the wind or hitch a ride on passing animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/04/the-sublime-slime-mold.html |title=Slime Molds: No Brains, No Feet, No Problem |author=Rebecca Jacobson |date=April 5, 2012 |publisher=PBS Newshour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They feed on [[microorganisms]] that live in any type of dead plant material. They contribute to the decomposition of dead vegetation, and feed on bacteria, yeasts, and fungi. For this reason, slime molds are usually found in [[soil]], [[lawn]]s, and on the [[forest floor]], commonly on [[deciduous]] logs. However, in [[tropics|tropical areas]] they are also common on [[inflorescences]] and [[fruit]]s, and in aerial situations (e.g., in the canopy of trees). In urban areas, they are found on [[mulch]] or even in the [[leaf mold]] in [[rain gutter]]s, and also grow in air conditioners, especially when the drain is blocked.

==Taxonomy==

===Older classification===
Slime molds, as a group, are [[polyphyletic]]. They were originally represented by the subkingdom '''Gymnomycota''' in the [[Fungi]] kingdom and included the defunct phyla [[Myxomycota (disambiguation)|Myxomycota]], [[Acrasiomycota]], and [[Labyrinthulomycota]]. Today, slime molds have been divided among several supergroups, ''none'' of which is included in the kingdom Fungi.

Slime molds can generally be divided into two main groups.
*A [[Plasmodium (slime mold)|plasmodial]] slime mold is enclosed within a single membrane without walls and is one large cell. This "supercell" (a [[syncytium]]) is essentially a bag of [[cytoplasm]] containing thousands of individual nuclei. See [[heterokaryosis]].
*By contrast, cellular slime molds spend most of their lives as individual unicellular [[protist]]s, but when a chemical signal is secreted, they assemble into a cluster that acts as one organism.

===Modern classification===
In more strict terms, slime molds comprise the [[mycetozoan]] group of the [[amoebozoa]]. Mycetozoa include the following three groups:
*[[Myxogastria]] or myxomycetes: [[Syncytium|syncytial]], plasmodial, or acellular slime molds
*[[Dictyosteliida]] or dictyostelids: cellular slime molds
*[[Protosteloid]]s

Even at this level of classification there are conflicts to be resolved. Recent molecular evidence shows that, while the first two groups are likely to be monophyletic, the protosteloids are likely to be polyphyletic. For this reason, scientists are currently trying to understand the relationships among these three groups.

[[File:Schleimpilz Urwald Sababurg.jpg|thumb|Slime mold ''Trichia varia'']]

The most commonly encountered are the [[Myxogastria]]. A common slime mold that forms tiny brown tufts on rotting logs is ''[[Stemonitis]]''. Another form, which lives in rotting logs and is often used in research, is ''[[Physarum polycephalum]]''. In logs, it has the appearance of a slimy web-work of yellow threads, up to a few feet in size. ''[[Fuligo]]'' forms yellow crusts in mulch.

The ''[[Dictyosteliida]]'', cellular slime molds, are distantly related to the plasmodial slime molds and have a very different lifestyle. Their amoebae do not form huge [[coenocyte]]s, and remain individual. They live in similar habitats and feed on microorganisms. When food runs out and they are ready to form sporangia, they do something radically different. They release signal molecules into their environment, by which they find each other and create swarms. These [[amoeba]] then join up into a tiny multicellular slug-like coordinated creature, which crawls to an open lit place and grows into a fruiting body. Some of the amoebae become spores to begin the next generation, but some of the amoebae sacrifice themselves to become a dead stalk, lifting the spores up into the air.

The [[protosteloid]]s have characters intermediate between the previous two groups, but they are much smaller, the fruiting bodies only forming one to a few [[spores]].

Non-amoebozoan slime moulds include:
*[[Acrasid]]s (Order Acrasida): slime molds which belong to the [[Heterolobosea]] within the super group [[Excavata]]. They have a similar life style to [[Dictyostelium|Dictyostelids]], but their amoebae behave differently, having eruptive pseudopodia. They used to belong to the defunct phylum of Acrasiomycota.
*[[Plasmodiophorid]]s (Order Plasmodiophorida): [[parasite|parasitic]] protists which belong to the super group [[Rhizaria]]. They can cause [[Clubroot|cabbage club root disease]] and [[powdery scab|powdery scab tuber disease]]. The Plasmodiophorids also form [[coenocyte]]s, but are internal parasites of plants (e.g., Club root disease of cabbages).
*[[Labyrinthulomycetes|Labyrinthulomycota]]: slime nets, which belong to the superphylum [[Heterokonta]] as the class Labyrinthulomycetes. They are marine and form labyrinthine networks of tubes in which amoeba without [[pseudopod]]s can travel.
*''[[Fonticula]]'' is a cellular slime mold that forms a fruiting body in a volcano shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal= Science |date= 31 July 1981 |volume= 213 |issue= 4507 |pages= 561–563 |doi= 10.1126/science.213.4507.561 |title= Role of Golgi Apparatus in Sorogenesis by the Cellular Slime Mold ''Fonticula alba'' |author= Mary C.

==Life cycle==
[[File:Slime.mold.jpg|thumb|right|Slime mold growing out of a bin of wet paper]]
Slime molds begin life as [[amoeba]]-like [[cell (biology)|cells]]. These unicellular amoebae are commonly [[haploid]], and feed on [[bacteria]]. These amoebae can mate if they encounter the correct mating type and form [[zygote]]s that then grow into [[plasmodium (life cycle)|plasmodia]]. These contain many [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] without [[cell membranes]] between them, and can grow to be meters in size. The species ''[[Fuligo septica]]'' is often seen as a slimy yellow network in and on rotting logs. The amoebae and the plasmodia engulf microorganisms.&lt;ref name="Ling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://npsnj.org/articles/myxomycetes.html|title=The Native Plant Society of New Jersey|website=npsnj.org|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plasmodium grows into an interconnected network of protoplasmic strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975910|title=Life at the Edge of Sight |author= Scott Chimileski, Roberto Kolter |publisher=Harvard University Press|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within each protoplasmic strand, the cytoplasmic contents rapidly stream. If one strand is carefully watched for about 50 seconds, the cytoplasm can be seen to slow, stop, and then reverse direction. The streaming protoplasm within a plasmodial strand can reach speeds of up to 1.35&amp;nbsp;mm per second, which is the fastest rate recorded for any microorganism.&lt;ref&gt;Alexopolous, C.J. 1962, second edition. "Introductory Mycology" John Wiley and Sons, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Migration of the plasmodium is accomplished when more protoplasm streams to advancing areas and protoplasm is withdrawn from rear areas. When the food supply wanes, the plasmodium will migrate to the surface of its substrate and transform into rigid fruiting bodies. The fruiting bodies or [[sporangium|sporangia]] are what we commonly see; they superficially look like fungi or molds but are not related to the true fungi. These sporangia will then release spores which hatch into amoebae to begin the life cycle again.

==Plasmodia==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Enteridium lycoperdon, (Bull.) M.L. Farr, 1976 (Reticularia lycoperdon).JPG|thumb|upright|The mid sporangial phase of ''[[Enteridium lycoperdon]]'' on a mossy tree trunk.]]
In ''[[Myxogastria]]'', the plasmodial portion of the life cycle only occurs after [[syngamy]], which is the fusion of cytoplasm and [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] of myxoamoebae or swarm cells. The diploid zygote becomes a [[multinucleate]]d plasmodium through multiple nuclear divisions without further cell division. Myxomycete plasmodia are multinucleate masses of [[protoplasm]] that move by cytoplasmic streaming. In order for the plasmodium to move, cytoplasm must be diverted towards the leading edge from the lagging end. This process results in the plasmodium advancing in fan-like fronts. As it moves, plasmodium also gains nutrients through the [[phagocytosis]] of bacteria and small pieces of organic matter.

The plasmodium also has the ability to subdivide and establish separate plasmodia. Conversely, separate plasmodia that are genetically similar and compatible can fuse together to create a larger plasmodium. In the event that conditions become dry, the plasmodium will form a sclerotium, essentially a dry and dormant state. In the event that conditions become moist again the sclerotium absorbs water and an active plasmodium is restored. When the food supply wanes, the Myxomycete plasmodium will enter the next stage of its life cycle forming haploid [[spore]]s, often in a well-defined [[sporangium]] or other spore-bearing structure.

==Behavior==
When a slime mold mass or mound is physically separated, the cells find their way back to re-unite. Studies on ''[[Physarum polycephalum]]'' have even shown an ability to learn and predict periodic unfavorable conditions in laboratory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saigusa |first1=Tetsu |last2=Tero |first2=Atsushi |last3=Nakagaki |first3=Toshiyuki |last4=Kuramoto |first4=Yoshiki |title=Amoebae Anticipate Periodic Events |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=018101 |year=2008 |pmid=18232821 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.018101 |laysummary=http://discovermagazine.com/2009/jan/071 |laysource=Discover Magazine |laydate=December 9, 2008|url=http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/33004/1/PhysRevLett_100_018101.pdf |hdl=2115/33004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Tyler Bonner]], a professor of ecology known for his studies of slime molds, argues that they are "no more than a bag of amoebae encased in a thin slime sheath, yet they manage to have various behaviours that are equal to those of animals who possess muscles and nerves with ganglia – that is, simple brains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Kitta |last1=MacPherson |date=January 21, 2010 |title=The 'sultan of slime': Biologist continues to be fascinated by organisms after nearly 70 years of study |url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S26/40/89S11/index.xml |publisher=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atsushi Tero of [[Hokkaido University]] grew ''Physarum'' in a flat wet dish, placing the mold in a central position representing Tokyo and oat flakes surrounding it corresponding to the locations of other major cities in the Greater Tokyo Area. As ''Physarum'' avoids bright light, light was used to simulate mountains, water and other obstacles in the dish. The mold first densely filled the space with plasmodia, and then thinned the network to focus on efficiently connected branches. The network strikingly resembled Tokyo's rail system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tero |first1=A. |last2=Takagi |first2=S. |last3=Saigusa |first3=T. |last4=Ito |first4=K. |last5=Bebber |first5=D.P. |last6=Fricker |first6=M.D. |last7=Yumiki |first7=K. |last8=Kobayashi |first8=R. |last9=Nakagaki |first9=T. |title=Rules for Biologically Inspired Adaptive Network Design |journal=Science |volume=327 |issue=5964 |pages=439–442 |year=2010 |pmid=20093467 |doi=10.1126/science.1177894 |laysummary=http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2010/01/21/slime-mould-attacks-simulates-tokyo-rail-network/|laysource=ScienceBlogs |laydate=January 21, 2010|citeseerx=10.1.1.225.9609 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Technovelgy, [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=2756 Slime Mold Network Engineering], 1/25/2010 (contains images). &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5393">[[Image:Sturebymordet-minnesplats 001.jpg|thumb|A memorial for Therese Johansson Rojo at the place of her murder.]]

The '''Stureby murder''' occurred on June 6, 2009 when 15-year-old '''Therese Johansson Rojo''' (born June 17, 1993) was murdered in [[Stureby]], located outside of [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] by two schoolmates. The two 16-year-olds, who eventually admitted to murdering Johansson Rojo, were arrested the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Simon |last=Andrén |url=http://www.dn.se/sthlm/mordet-planerat-under-flera-veckor-1.926866 |title=Mordet planerat under flera veckor |trans-title=The murder planned for several weeks |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2012-11-13 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911111911/http://www.dn.se/sthlm/mordet-planerat-under-flera-veckor-1.926866 |archivedate=September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The girl had managed to get the boy to carry out the murder by [[SMS]] text messages, telephone calls and chatroom contact during a period of time leading up to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ulrika |last=By |url=http://www.dn.se/sthlm/svartsjuka-hat-och-langtan-i-de-atalades-sms-1.926860 |title=Svartsjuka, hat och längtan i de åtalades sms |trans-title=Jealousy, hatred and the desire in the text messages of the accused |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2012-11-13 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424234315/http://www.dn.se/sthlm/svartsjuka-hat-och-langtan-i-de-atalades-sms-1.926860 |archivedate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events of June 6, 2009==
On the evening of June 6, the boy took Therese out into the woods during a party to celebrate that school was almost over and that prom was coming up. He hit her in the back with a tree branch and then strangled her to death. The boy and the girl who were charged with the murder were a couple and Therese Johansson Rojo had kissed the boy during a party in May 2009. The murderer was encouraged by his girlfriend through texting and chatroom contact to commit the murder to prove his love and get his girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article6021810.ab |title=Familjen: Straffet är ett hån |trans-title=The Family: The punishment is an insult |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |first=Linda |last=Hjertén |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2012-11-13 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sentencing ==
Because of their young age, the two teenagers received twenty months imprisonment apiece in a special care home. The girl has appealed her sentence, delaying the implementation of her sentence until the appeal was condered by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article6022420.ab |title=Känslan av skuld får 16-åringarna alltid bära |trans-title=The feeling of guilt as what 16-year-olds always have to bear |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |first=Kerstin |last=Nilsson |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2012-11-13 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both of the teenagers will be released during the summer of 2011 under the current sentence, and both of their sentences has been appealed by the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ulrika |last=By |url=http://www.dn.se/sthlm/aklagare-overklagar-stureby-domen-1.983317 |title=Åklagare överklagar Stureby-domen |trans-title=Prosecutors appeal Stureby ruling |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2012-11-13 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130113103/http://www.dn.se/sthlm/aklagare-overklagar-stureby-domen-1.983317 |archivedate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentences have received a great deal of criticism from both the Swedish media and from the population at large, and calls have been made to change the law as it is applied to young offenders in Sweden, because the maximum sentence for a young offender is four years in custody.

== Aftermath ==
The newspaper [[Aftonbladet]] initiated a campaign called "Glöm inte Therese" on June 12, 2009, which gives money to the help organisation BRIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article5370879.ab |title=Glöm inte Therese |trans-title=Do not forget Therese |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |first=Kristina |last=Edblom |date=2009-06-12 |accessdate=2012-11-13 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murder victim [[Riccardo Campogiani]]'s parents also supported the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article5377217.ab |title=Riccardos föräldrar går med i kampanjen |trans-title=Riccardo's parents join the campaign |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |first=Claes |last=Petersson |date=2009-06-13 |accessdate=2012-11-13 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Therese Johansson Rojo murder became the most noted murder in [[Sweden]] during 2009.

The '''Tenctonese''', also known as '''Newcomers''', are the main fictional [[humanoid]] species in the ''[[Alien Nation|Alien Nation franchise]]'', including the [[Alien Nation (film)|1988 film]], the subsequent [[Alien Nation (1989 TV series)|television series]], and spinoff media. They are from the planet Tencton, though references to numerous slave colonies throughout the series and telemovies indicate that they are widespread beyond their own planet. They are easily distinguished from humans by their hairless, spotted heads and lack of [[pinna (anatomy)|external ears]]. According to the show, more than a quarter of a million Tenctonese reside on [[Earth]] in the [[United States]], mostly in the [[Los Angeles]] area.

In their slave society, Tenctonese are taken from their parents as children at the age of ten and their tasks are allotted to them. Some of these children are chosen to be "''Kleezantsun''" or Overseers and are specially conditioned. There are several levels of Overseers, from lowly civilian slave group leaders in charge of the procurement and transport of slaves, to commanders of military vessels, with the highest-ranking Tenctonese seen being a Fleet Commander with subordinate commanders, addressed as "[[Excellency]]." The Overseers are now a new organized crime element in Los Angeles, rivalling the [[Mafia]] or the [[Yakuza]]. Whether there is a master race to the Tenctonese, or if a small segment of the Tenctonese themselves rule the slaves under them, has never been made exactly clear, although it has been stated that they are a genetically engineered race designed for any work environment.

==History==
[[Image:Alien Nation.jpg|thumb|right|A Tenctonese family, an unrelated Tenctonese woman, and a human]]
On October 19, 1990, a spacecraft from the planet Tencton crash-landed in [[California]]'s [[Mojave Desert]] just outside Los Angeles. The {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} slave ship ''Gruza'' was transporting 250,000 Tenctonese especially bred and genetically engineered for hard labor in any environment. The slave ship's overseers, identified by jagged wrist tattoos, used hallucinogenic nerve gases to induce fear and keep the slaves submissive. They also exploited the slaves' culture and mythology by personifying the roles of Tenctonese "demons". Because of the hallucinogenic gas and the intertwining of their cultural mythology and their condition of slavery, several years would pass before the Tenctonese could even remember there having been anyone on the slave ship to rebel against, or even that there had been attempts by slaves to rebel, such as the Udara faction.

Despite the Overseers' attempts to subdue the slaves, a vibrant culture managed to survive the voyage. The Tenctonese elders functioned as a government-in-exile, and there was a recognized resistance force, as well as an extremist resistance faction called Udara, which "seeded" its own members as well as children on the slaveship with programming activated by post-hypnotic suggestion which turned the "seeded" individual into a programmable killing machine.

The Overseers arbitrarily punished innocent Tenctonese in retaliation for Udara's actions. Because of this, feelings about Udara were mixed. Some considered them heroes, while others considered them no better than the Overseers.

Initially the U.S. government quarantined the aliens for several months and with the assistance of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] each slave was given a [[human]] name. Most of the first Tenctonese to be processed received "normal" human names. However, as the aliens continued to pour in, INS workers became bored and overworked, and at times chose whimsical names, reflecting historical or literary characters and geographic settings. Some examples: [[Albert Einstein]], [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Betsy Ross]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Madame Bovary|Emma Bovary]], [[Silas Marner]], [[Kennebunkport, Maine|Kenny Bunkport]], [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], [[Mayonnaise|May O'Naise]], [[San Francisco|Sam Francisco]], Phillip Dirt, [[Talking bird|Polly Wanakraker]], and [[Pallbearer|Paul Bearer]].

After being released from quarantine, the majority of the Tenctonese settled in an area of Los Angeles that became known as ''Little Tencton'' (or, abusively, ''Slagtown''). They assimilated into [[United States|American]] culture, becoming known as "Newcomers," taking jobs wherever their individual talents might lie and becoming just another minority in the city.

The Newcomers are hated by some humans, self-proclaimed "Purists" who fear the alien presence on the planet. These people use the pejorative terms "slags", "spongeheads", or "rubberheads" when referring to these interstellar [[refugee]]s, who in turn derogatorily call humans "''terts''", or "''Slo'ka''" — each being a different insult. Like any other minority group, the Newcomers face a daily battle just to maintain their [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]].

==Culture==
Tenctonese are highly spiritual, and have at least three, and possibly more, major religions. The most common Tenctonese religious tradition is called Celinism, and is based on the idea of living by the example set by Celine and Andarko, a Tenctonese woman and man who sacrificed their own lives long ago to save many. Detective George Francisco and his immediate family practice Celinism.

Another religious tradition, practiced by Uncle Moodri, identified as only "pre-Celinist," is distinguished by its matriarchial traditions and worship of the goddess Ionia. A third tradition, practiced by Cathy Frankel, is described as more like an Eastern tradition, being more "internal." From what we know of Cathy's past and way of life, her religion seems to be based on the concept of worshipping the emotion love; she has been heard praying "Love keep me." Also the Tenctonese third gender, the 'Binnaum,' appear to live in a style similar to Buddhist Monks and may be considered a religion on their own. Various "Liubof" (Russian for 'love') sects also exist among the Tenctonese, as well as a number of smaller cults that have broken with mainstream Tenctonese religion.

Despite having religious differences, Tenctonese do not appear to experience many religious conflicts. As stated, even members of the same family may follow different faiths. Many Tenctonese of different faiths observe the same [[Secularity|secular]] [[holiday]]s, such as the Day of Descent.

Some Tenctonese spiritual practices appear to transcend religious differences. One example is the ''serdso'', a colorful, palm-sized artifact which is said to carry the soul of an individual Tenctonese. It is placed near the bed every night, so that the soul, which wanders during sleep, can return to the waking world. Warriors in Tenctonese society were said to have fought for their ''serdsos''.

In addition, the matriarchal system of the pre-Celinists seems to have been inherited by the Celinists and possibly other Tenctonese religious groups, from the Pre-Celenist tradition. In the most traditional of Tenctonese villages, women are said to have made all the decisions, while the men only gathered roots and had babies. This has been relaxed by modern Tenctonese, but the matrilineal social structure has been maintained, as is evident in the female-dominated Tenctonese clergy and the tradition of men moving into women's homes, or "nests".

Practitioners of the Celinist tradition make use of an object known either as the "Portal" or the "Heart of Tencton," a technological marvel in the form of a small box with symbolic ornamentation, which is in fact capable of projecting virtual environments, including alien worlds, for its users to navigate as they attempt to reach a higher spiritual plane. The box contains a highly powerful energy source, and if opened incorrectly, will burn its handler into a charred corpse. The box, officially the property of the Tenctonese elders, was at one time appropriated illegally by a Tenctonese millennial splinter cult.

The Tenctonese have fairly mature attitudes towards sex:  it happens and is enjoyable, and nothing to be ashamed about, but at the same time, they feel it is not something to be taken lightly.  They find oversexualized human things such as pornography to be silly or juvenile.  They also have no particular taboo against same-sex relationships.

Ironically, among the formerly enslaved Tenctonese is a lowly [[caste]] of "Eenos." Eenos can be distinguished by a spotting pattern that is considered gray and ill-defined by other Tenctonese, who hardly consider Eenos to be of their own species. The reason for this is that Eenos performed the lowliest jobs on the slave ships, primarily involving waste-handling, and were forced to feed themselves from the waste, which included the bodies of the dead. Eenos are considered cannibals by the other Tenctonese, despite the fact that the situation was involuntarily forced upon them during slavery and they had no other option. Resentment is so strong between Eenos and other Tenctonese that most humans do not even know the Eenos exist. Upon reaching Earth, the caste system was maintained, with Eenos taking the jobs of the "unclean," (waste management, etc.) and living primarily underground.

The Tenctonese refugees living on Earth have been faced with assimilating into human culture, while some staunchly believe they should stand by their own traditions.  While ''binnaum'' males do not marry in their society (see "Reproduction"), some of them on Earth have entered into monogamous marriages.

When a Tenctonese falls ill, even if they are recuperating in a hospital, it is customary to bring them gifts of living things such as small animals or potted plants to brighten their mood.  Conversely, it is considered disturbing to bring them a gift of a bouquet of flowers (as humans often do in hospitals), because even if they are still fresh and colorful, the flowers are technically ''dead'' - and it is morbid to remind a sick person about mortality.

Another curious encounter between the two cultures is that the Tenctonese are very fond of [[clowns]], including artwork of clowns.  When Cathy moves into Matt's apartment she decorates it with numerous clown paintings and figurines.  Partly this is because they enjoy that they are very colorful, partly because their alien culture has no equivalent to clowns (possibly because they were a slave race), and having never seen anything like them before, they think clowns are very interesting.

==Physiology==
The Tenctonese look generally similar to humans, but have bulbous [[Skull|cranium]]s and no hair on their [[scalp]]s. Instead they have large reddish-brown spot-like markings on their heads and down their spines. These ''Potniki'' spots are an [[erogenous zone]] and will identify the individual and family. These markings will fade with the loss of mental faculties due to drunkenness, age, or [[drug]]s. This effect is similar to a human’s eyes losing focus and glazing over.

Since they had been bred as slaves, the Newcomers are 30% stronger and 20% smarter than the average human, as well as having a [[life expectancy]] of about 140 years and keener senses. This is partially due to the way they have been bred for adaptability but also due to their anatomical differences, which include having two [[heart]]s. With two hearts, the onset time of poisons is halved. If one heart is damaged, the other will work harder for a limited time. One heart is located in approximately the same spot as a human heart, the second is located in the center of the chest at the bottom of the [[Human rib cage|rib cage]].

Additional differences include the fact that Tenctonese bodies do not assimilate the nutrients of food if it has been cooked. Their main diet consist of raw animal flesh such as uncooked small mammals ([[weasel]], [[beaver]], [[muskrat]]), organs ([[spleen]], [[pancreas]]), [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s and [[insect]]s and raw [[vegetable]]s. Drinking sour milk affects them in the same way that humans are intoxicated by [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]. Rather than blush, the eyes of the Tenctonese change color with embarrassment. Instead of getting tense around the neck when they feel stress, their feet swell. Tenctonese ears look more like slits or holes in the sides of their heads but are still more sensitive than human ears. They also have no fingerprints, need large doses of [[ultraviolet]] light to increase energy levels, and suffer similar effects to [[acid]] burns when splashed with ordinary salt water.

Some terrestrial diseases appear to affect the Tenctonese as well, though their reactions to these diseases may be different. For example, instead of sneezing, a Tenctonese affected by the common cold has a tendency to blink rapidly and in succession.

Tenctonese have very sensitive [[nerve]] clusters, or ''axials'', just underneath their [[Axilla|armpit]] that are the physiological equivalent of human [[Temple (anatomy)|temples]]. Striking them there has the equivalent effect of kicking a human in the [[groin]]. If precisely struck with enough force, a blow to the axial can be fatal.

Certain common compounds found on Earth are poisonous to the Newcomers and some compounds that are poisonous to humans are harmless to Tenctonese. Poisons include [[salt]] (harshly caustic); [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) (mild poison); [[chocolate]] (gives them the shakes, leads to a heart attack); [[tobacco]] (makes them stutter, leads to [[laryngitis]]); [[fluoride]] (strong poison); [[fluorocarbon]]s (choking, leads to asphyxiation); and [[caffeine]] (causes dizziness). However, [[methane]], alcohol, [[asbestos]], and [[radon]], have no effect on them. Some Newcomers, such as Uncle Moodri, have demonstrated an ability to touch salt water (Moodri actually walked in ocean water) without harm. Newcomers sprinkle [[arsenic]] flakes on their food, but it is unknown whether it is a required nutrient, or just tastes good to them.

The Newcomers have a number of organs that humans do not have, such as the ''spartiary gland'', which produces a substance in Tenctonese [[blood cell]]s that accelerates healing by rapidly carrying oxygen and needed nutrients to injured areas, and gives Tenctonese blood its pink color. Because of the color of their blood, the skin of the Tenctonese has a pinker hue than human [[White people|Caucasians]].

Having been genetically engineered to adapt to harsh conditions, Tenctonese may evolve more rapidly in certain situations than human populations. It is not unheard of for Tenctonese to "adapt" in a single generation. This potential adaptability is addressed several times throughout the franchise by various characters. The original movie ''[[Alien Nation (film)|Alien Nation]]'' also introduced a drug used on the slave ship that, in an otherwise fatal environment, triggers a last-ditch physiological alteration in Newcomers.

At about eight weeks, the Tenctonese [[fetus]], inside its pod, possesses several [[insect]]-like characteristics, including claws and an [[exoskeleton]], suggesting that the Tenctonese evolved from an ancestor possessing these characteristics.

==Reproduction==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Tenctonese-profile.jpg|thumb|left|A Tenctonese binnaum.]] --&gt;
One sexual activity among Tenctonese, where one hums along the spots on his or her partner’s back, is referred to as ''humming''.

Their method of [[Reproduction|procreation]] is also unique. For the Newcomers to conceive, there are two kinds of Newcomer males, ''gannaum'' and ''binnaum''. Fertilization of the female’s [[ovum|egg]] requires both types of male. The ''binnaum'' prepares the ''linnaum'' (female) for fertilization. ''Binnaum'' children are rare (1 in 100) and do not take permanent mates. Instead, they are expected to grant their services as needed for the continuance of their race. A ''binnaum'' is recognizable by the oversized spots on his head. These individuals form a brotherhood and each of them service hundreds of females a year. The ceremony of fertilization is shared by close friends. While holding burning candles, those in attendance discreetly turn their backs on the female as the ''binnaum'' prepares her for her spouse. The ''binnaum'' prepares the "channel" with the catalyzing emission, and the ''gannaum'' (the father) provides the [[sperm]]. The ''binnaum'' does not contribute genetically to the offspring, however. The [[Ejaculation|ejaculate]] of Newcomers is referred to as "Aklafluid."  The specific physical mechanics of the Tenctonese sex act are not explicitly stated, but their sex organs are implied to be radically different from those used in human reproduction.  In the original movie, Matt tries to explain to George how a condom works by unfolding it over his fingers and loosely describing that it stretches, George is amazed that it can fit. Implying that the males of his species must have much larger reproductive organs.

Binnaums, in addition to their role in reproduction, also demonstrate an ability to communicate with others on what has been described in the telemovies as a psychic plane. This communication, not limited to other binnaums, seems to take the form of telepathically transmitted imagery.

Another major difference between Newcomers and Humans is that the male and female Tenctonese share the burdens of reproduction equally, with the female carrying the baby for only the first eight weeks of the pregnancy. The baby is incubated in a pod called the ''haffacotta'' (pod surrounding the fetus) inside the mother's womb. As seen in the series episode '''Partners''', the male and female remain biologically in-sync throughout the process so when the female begins to experience pangs of the coming separation, the male will experience pains in his ''lingpod flap'', which will also fall and open in preparation for the pod. The time of passing the pod to the father is a much celebrated happening in which the entire family participates. The mother enters a state of relaxation to allow her body to begin the process of transferring the ''haffacotta''. The female's navel opens and the pod's tentacle emerges. This tentacle is gently encouraged to suction to the father's chest. The pod is then passed out of the female womb through the navel. Charcoal powder is sprinkled on the navel to enable its closure. A hard shell develops around the pod as it dries in the open air, this shell is immediately cracked off gently and in some cases a piece is eaten by either or both parents. The sex is identifiable once the ''haffacotta'' is completely shelled and then the pod is gently placed inside the ''lingpod flap'' by both parents. The male will carry the ''haffacotta'' inside his ''lingpod flap'' for the remaining eight weeks of pregnancy, similar to a [[kangaroo]]'s pouch, until he gives birth, much like a male [[seahorse]].

As seen in the Alien Nation telemovie "Body and Soul," Newcomer/Human copulation is possible, but if it is attempted without proper training, the human will suffer serious injury. Even simply attempting to copulate with a Newcomer can result in [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] at the very least. Newcomer sex clinics exist in order to facilitate mixed-species relationships. Whether it is only human males who risk injury in sex with Newcomers, or if human women would be similarly affected via sex with Newcomer men, was never elaborated on. Male newcomers and human women have, however, been seen as couples in the series (Mr. and Mrs. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] of Nu-Knit, Inc.), and a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] male mixed-species couple attended classes at the sex clinic, so there is some circumstantial evidence that mixed-species copulations may pose a danger for both male and female humans.

As Newcomers have been known to adapt quickly to new environments, it has been theorized that the ability to interbreed with humans is only a matter of time. When a deformed Newcomer girl was publicized as a hybrid,  outrage from both human Purist and Newcomer communities was naturally triggered, with both sides fearing that interbreeding would lead to pollution of their respective species' gene pools.

In the 8th and final novel of the series, ''Cross of Blood'', it was confirmed that Humans and Newcomers are (potentially) reproductively compatible, when Cathy Frankel (a Tenctonese female) became pregnant with Matthew Sikes' (a human male) child without the aid of a Binnaum''.''  In this case, unlike the normal Tenctonese gestation cycle, the Newcomer female carried the child for the full term of the pregnancy. However, the resulting offspring did not survive beyond the first few weeks of his birth, due to physiological incompatibilities resulting from his Tenctonese biology trying to overtake/override his human biology.  This may have been a natural result of the pairing, or the result of tampering as the child had been kidnapped at birth and held by a Purist cell.  With proper care and observation, it may have been possible for the child to have survived.  However, the topic of cross-breeding did not come up again as Cross of Blood was the final novel of the franchise, and the subsequent comics did not approach that particular aspect of Human/Tenctonese relations again.

'''Terje "Valfar" Bakken''' (September 3, 1978 – January 14, 2004) was the lead singer and founder of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[black metal]] band [[Windir]]. Windir was started as a one-man project, but it was expanded into a full band with the release of their third album, ''[[1184 (album)|1184]]''. Valfar originally sang his lyrics in [[Sognamål]], a dialect of Norwegian, but eventually switched to [[English language|English]] in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience.

==Biography==
'''Terje''' was born and grew up in [[Sogndal]] which he was very proud of and one can clearly see the importance of [[Sogndal]] in his lyrics. Terje decided to form [[Windir]] into a full band while he was at college, with some of his classmates becoming the other band members.
 
Valfar released two demos, ''Sogneriket'' and  ''Det Gamle Riket''.

His second studio album, ''[[Arntor]]'', was the last Windir album recorded by a line-up consisting solely of Valfar.

Despite his vocal style, Valfar did not relate his music to black metal, probably because of how the scene acted and was stereotyped. He instead dubbed Windir's musical style as "Sognametal". Other bands that have a Sognametal sound are [[Cor Scorpii]], [[Vreid]], [[Feigd]], [[Mistur]], and Sigtyr. He read a lot about [[Sogndal]] history that his poems stemmed from it.

===Death===
On January 14, 2004, Valfar went for a walk towards his family's cabin at [[Fagereggi]], but he never arrived. Three days later, authorities found his body at [[Reppastølen]] in the [[Sogndal Valley]]. Valfar had been caught in a snow storm and died from [[hypothermia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=7250|title=Metal Underground Web Article: Windir Frontman, Valfar (a.k.a. Terje Bakken), Found Dead at 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried at Stedje Church in [[Sogndal]] on January 27, 2004. 
[[File:Terje Bakken's grave.jpg|thumbnail|right|Terje Bakken's grave]]

Nearly two months after his death, the remaining members of [[Windir]] decided to disband.

'''Tip growth''' is an extreme form of polarised growth of living cells that results in an elongated cylindrical cell morphology with a rounded tip at which the growth activity takes place. Tip growth occurs in algae (e.g., ''[[Acetabularia acetabulum]]''), fungi ([[hypha]]e) and plants (e.g. [[Trichome|root hairs]] and [[pollen tubes]]).

Tip growth is a process that has many similarities in diverse walled cells such as pollen tubes, root hairs, and hyphae.

== Fungal tip growth and hyphal tropisms==

Fungal hyphae extend continuously at their extreme tips, where enzymes are released into the environment and where new wall materials are synthesised. The rate of tip extension can be extremely rapid - up to 40 micrometres per minute. It is supported by the continuous movement of materials into the tip from older regions of the hyphae. So, in effect, a fungal hypha is a continuously moving mass of protoplasm in a continuously extending tube. This unique mode of growth - apical growth - is the hallmark of fungi, and it accounts for much of their environmental and economic significance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biology.ed.ac.uk/research/groups/jdeacon/microbes/apical.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">'''Tri Hita Karana''' is a traditional philosophy for life on the island of [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]. The literal translation is roughly the "three causes of well-being" or "three reasons for prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Fox, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eKqvEZc8y3MC&amp;pg=PA118 Critical Reflections on Religion and Media in Contemporary Bali], Brill, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The three causes referred to in the principle are:
# Harmony among people
# Harmony with nature or environment
# Harmony with God

It is derived from the [[Balinese Hinduism|Balinese spiritualism and beliefs]], which promotes harmony among fellow human beings through communal cooperation and promoting compassion; harmony towards God, manifested in numerous rituals and offerings to appease deities; and harmony with their environment, which strife to conserve the nature and promote the sustainability and balance of the environment. Tri Hita Karana is credited for the island's prosperity as a whole, its relatively stable record of development, environmental practices, and the overall quality of life for its residents.&lt;ref&gt;Anand Krishna, Tri Hita Karana: Ancient Balinese Wisdom for Neo Humans, Anand Ashram Foundation, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of Tri Hita Karana guides many aspects of Balinese life, from daily rituals, communal ''gotong-royong'' cooperation practice, to spatial organization in [[Balinese architecture]]. It is also reflected in the natural irrigation system on the island known as [[subak]], which consists of cooperatively managed [[weirs]] and [[canals]] that draw from a single water source.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1194 Cultural Landscape of Bali Province: the Subak System as a Manifestation of the Tri Hita Karana Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt; Former President of Indonesia, [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], even invoked it in his address to the International Conference on Sustainable Development during APEC 2013, which was held in Bali.&lt;ref&gt;Global Travel Industry News, [http://www.eturbonews.com/38679/bali-s-tri-hita-karana-life-philosophy-recommended-apec-sustaina Bali’s Tri Hita Karana life philosophy recommended for APEC Sustainable Economic Development], 9 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
