In [[Bangladesh]], the profession of [[accountancy]] developed during the British colonial period. The basic requirements for financial reporting by all companies in Bangladesh are provided by the Companies Act of 1994. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iasplus.com/en/jurisdictions/asia/bangladesh|title=Bangladesh|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iasplus.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is represented by two professional bodies, the [[Institute of Cost &amp; Management Accountants of Bangladesh]] (ICMAB) and the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh]] (ICAB).

Chartered Accountants complete their training in practising firms and specialise in financial accounting, financial audit and tax. CMAs receive particular training in cost audit, management audit and management accounting, as well as general accounting and taxation. Both the ICMAB and ICAB are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Commerce. The Government of Bangladesh considers both type of professional accountants equal in respect of employment in government services per circular No.Com/PTMA/AP/2/19/87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icmab.org.bd/index.php/2011-06-13-09-13-35/services-of-cmas |title=Services of CMAs |website=Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh |access-date=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP) in Bangladesh are based upon standards set by the ICAB, which has stated its intention to adopt [[International Financial Reporting Standards]].  {{As of|2013}}, ICAB has adopted the IFRS as issued by the IASB, except for [[IAS 39]], IAS 29, and IFRS 9 &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and All foreign companies, and domestic companies listed on the [[Dhaka Stock Exchange]] (DSE) and/or the [[Chittagong Stock Exchange]] (CSE) are required to use IFRS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David O'Regan |date=2003 |chapter=Bangladesh |title=International auditing: practical resource guide |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |pages=138 |isbn=0-471-26382-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifrs.org/Use-around-the-world/Documents/Jurisdiction-profiles/Bangladesh-IFRS-Profile.pdf |title=IFRS Application Around the World Jurisdictional Profile: Bangladesh |website=IFRS |access-date=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bangladesh Financial Reporting Standards (BFRS) ==
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) prescribes Financial Reporting Standards which are known as Bangladesh Financial Reporting Standards (BFRS). Bangladesh Accounting Standards (BAS) are also included in BFRS. International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards which are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board are what the BFRS models on. For listed companies under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, adopted BFRS are legally enforceable. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Accountants Profession of Bangladesh ==
The professional Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh's national body is the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh (ICMAB). In order to promote and regulate the Cost and Management Accounting profession in the country, the ICMAB was established. To students interested in pursuing a career in this field, the institute offers training and education and highly recognized CMA degrees on fulfillment of their qualifications. The ICMAB is the sole authority to issue licences to their members for practice in the field.  

They have many visions and missions. By promoting and regulating Cost and Management Accounting they want to improve the quality of life and economic competitiveness which will eventually lead to helping Bangladesh become and industrialized nation. The institute's mission is to provide better service to the society by having its members maintain the highest professional standard while developing, equipping, and promoting the Cost and Management Accounting profession. Implementation of National Accounting as well as Cost Accounting Standards are also used with other necessary steps in order to regulate the profession. The ultimate goal of this is to develop Bangladesh's natural and human resources to enrich the shared future of the country and to ensure common welfare. 

The Institute is governed by a council which is under the provision of the Cost and Management Accountants Ordinance of 1977. There are twelve members consisted in the council and they are elected by the members of ICMAB. The council also consists of four nominees from the Government of Bangladesh. Each term is for three years and every year there is one President, two Vice- Presidents, one Secretary, and one Treasurer elected from the councilors. A team of fully employed personnel, however, manages the day to day administrative affairs of the institute. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icmab.org.bd/index.php/about-us/the-institute|title=The Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=www.icmab.org.bd|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) ==
The sole regulator of accountants and auditors in Bangladesh under the Bangladesh Chartered Accountants Order of 1973 was the Institute of Charted Accountants (ICAB). There are many mandatory requirements included in the ICAB: 
# Determining if you are qualified for membership in the institute
# Being able to see the initial and continuing professional development of its members
# Having professional examinations conducted
# Establishing and maintaining a quality assurance review system
# Being able to licence auditors
# Maintaining and publishing of its members qualified to practice as accountants and auditors
# Investigating and disciplining its members for misconduct professionally
# Allowing them to set accounting and auditing standards 
Membership in the ICAB is mandatory for all Chartered Accountants whether financial accountant or financial auditor. Fellow Chartered Accountants or Associate Chartered Accountants are usually what members of the ICAB are designated as. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/membership/members/institute-chartered-accountants-bangladesh|title=Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh {{!}} IFAC|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ifac.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffiths is the son of Emily and [[Frank Griffiths]]. The Griffiths' family, including Arthur, were inducted into the [[British Columbia Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1995 under the builder category. The induction noted "In addition to his duties as owner of the team, Arthur Griffiths was also actively involved at the league level as a member of the NHL's Marketing / Public Relations Committee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bchhf.com/Inductees/griffiths.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928163834/http://www.bchhf.com/Inductees/griffiths.htm|archivedate=2007-09-28 |title=Arthur Griffiths |publisher=British Columbia Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The younger Griffiths inherited his father's ownership stake in the Vancouver Canucks in 1988. It was Griffiths who led the initiative to build [[GM Place]]. The original arena of the Canucks, the [[Pacific Coliseum]], was owned by the [[Pacific National Exhibition]].  The old coliseum became unsuitable for the growing team, and as result Griffiths financed the building of GM Place in 1995.

Griffiths sold the Vancouver Canucks in 1997. On running the Canucks, Griffiths' is quoted, "It was a wonderful life experience that many people would give their right arm for and I'm blessed that I had it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vancouver |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/sports/story.html?id=b4e646fb-32e8-489d-b2de-5a838158dc08 |title=Canucks still Griffiths' team |newspaper=Vancouver Sun | publisher=Canada.com |date=2006-11-10 |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffiths was also responsible for the formation of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Vancouver Grizzlies]], who began play in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infotecbsi.com/press/021506.html|title=Press Release: SEC form 8-K, Change in Directors or Principal Officers, Regulation FD Disclosure  Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers  |date=February 9, 2005| work= |publisher=Infotec Business Systems |accessdate=8 January 2010  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928190154/http://www.infotecbsi.com/press/021506.html  | archivedate = 2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grizzlies were sold and eventually moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 2001.

==2010 Olympics==
Griffiths' was invited to chair the not-for-profit [[Vancouver/Whistler 2010 Bid Society]].&lt;ref name=tourismvancouver&gt;{{cite press release|title=VANCOUVER 2010 - ORIGINS, HISTORY AND OUR FUTURE, |url=http://www.tourismvancouver.com/media/news_releases_2003.php?id=14 |publisher=Tourism Vancouver |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114155042/http://www.tourismvancouver.com/media/news_releases_2003.php?id=14 |archivedate=November 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1998, the Bid Society obtained the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]]'s endorsement of Vancouver's bid to host the 2010 Games, so that the bid could be presented before the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).

The Vancouver/Whistler 2010 Bid Society was dissolved in 2002 and succeeded by the more broadly-based [[Vancouver 2010 Bid Corporation]], which in 2003 successfully petitioned the IOC to award the Games to  the region.&lt;ref name=tourismvancouver/&gt;

During the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]], Griffiths worked in London for Russian sportswear company Bosco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Douglas|first=Greg|title=Ex-Canucks, Grizzlies owner Arthur Griffiths welcomed back during brief Vancouver visit|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Canucks+Grizzlies+owner+Arthur+Griffiths+welcomed+back+during+brief+Vancouver+visit/8302910/story.html#ixzz2zBxePabvt|accessdate=18 April 2014|newspaper=The Vancouver Sun|date=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canuck Place ==
From Canuck Place's official website, "Canuck Place is the first free-standing hospice for children in North America and its model of care has been used for many hospices..."  "The goal of this specialized care, known as pediatric palliative care, is to enhance the comfort and quality of life for both the child and their family.  It is achieved through the combination of active and compassionate therapies. Palliative care strives to support children and families by assisting them in fulfilling their physical, psychological, social and spiritual goals while remaining sensitive to personal, cultural and religious values, beliefs and practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canuckplace.org/  |title=Canuck Place   |publisher=Canuck Place |date= |accessdate=2010-01-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091217100517/http://www.canuckplace.org/| archivedate= 17 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Griffiths was the owner of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and controlled its community service arm, the Canuck Foundation.  In that year he met Brenda Eng and George Jarvis, who had the idea and passion to create a children's hospice in the lower mainland.  With the support of the Canuck Foundation, and other prominent organizations, 4 years later Canuck Place opened its doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canuckplace.org/about/overview/the_early_years_history.htm |title=The Early Years / History |publisher=Canuck Place |date=1995-11-30 |accessdate=2010-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008040720/http://www.canuckplace.org/about/overview/the_early_years_history.htm |archivedate=October 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BC Liberal Candidate for Vancouver-Burrard==
On May 20, 2008, Griffiths announced plans to run for the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] nomination for the newly created [[Vancouver-West End]] provincial riding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=5be55aa7-38a9-43e0-9ddc-75a86d9c4096 |title=Ex-Canucks owner Griffiths eyes nomination in Liberal riding |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-05-21 |work=The Province |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to [[Lorne Mayencourt]]'s subsequent resignation as MLA of the old [[Vancouver-Burrard]] riding to run in the [[2008 Canadian federal election]], Griffiths ran in the ensuing byelection under the old boundaries, and was defeated by NDP candidate [[Spencer Chandra Herbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/10/29/bc-vancouver-byelections-results.html |title=CBC News – British Columbia – NDP wins byelections in 2 Vancouver ridings |publisher=CBC News |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2010-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517011804/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/10/29/bc-vancouver-byelections-results.html |archivedate=May 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffiths did not contest the [[Vancouver-West End]] riding. In the [[British Columbia general election, 2009|2009 election]], the BC Liberal candidate was Laura McDiarmid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pablo |first=Carlito |url=https://www.straight.com/article-206606/laura-mcdiarmid-run-bc-liberals-vancouverwest-end |title=Laura McDiarmid to run for B.C.

'''Barbara Wertheim Tuchman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ʌ|k|m|ən}}; January 30, 1912 – February 6, 1989) was an [[United States|American]] historian and author. She won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] twice, for ''[[The Guns of August]]'' (1962), a [[bestseller|best-selling]] history of the prelude to and the first month of [[World War I]], and ''[[Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45|Stilwell and the American Experience in China]]'' (1971), a biography of General [[Joseph Stilwell]].&lt;ref name=pulitzer&gt;{{cite web| author=Ernest Becker |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/General-Nonfiction |title=The Pulitzer Prizes &amp;#124; General Nonfiction |publisher=Pulitzer.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuchman focused on writing [[popular history]].

==Early years==
She was born January 30, 1912, the daughter of the banker [[Maurice Wertheim]] and his first wife Alma Morgenthau. Her father was an individual of wealth and prestige, the owner of ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine, president of the [[American Jewish Congress]], prominent art collector, and a founder of the [[Theatre Guild]].&lt;ref name=Pollack&gt;Oliver B. Pollack, "Barbara W. Tuchman (1912-1989)," in Paula E. Hyman and Deborah Dash Moore (eds.), ''Jewish Women in America: An Historical Encyclopedia: Volume II, M-Z.'' New York: Routledge, 1997; pp. 1414-1416.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was the daughter of [[Henry Morgenthau Sr.|Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]], [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt;

While she did not explicitly mention it in her book ''[[The Guns of August]]'', Tuchman was present for one of the pivotal events of the book: [[Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|the pursuit of the German battle cruiser ''Goeben'' and light cruiser ''Breslau'']]. In her account of the pursuit she wrote, "That morning [August 10, 1914] there arrived in [[Constantinople]] the small Italian passenger steamer which had witnessed the ''[[HMS Gloucester (1909)|Gloucester]]'''s action against ''[[SMS Goeben|Goeben]]'' and ''[[SMS Breslau|Breslau]]''. Among its passengers were the daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren of the American ambassador Mr. Henry Morgenthau."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/830668272|title=The guns of August|last=Tuchman|first=Barbara W|date=|publisher=The Macmillan Company|year=1962|isbn=9781617939310|location=New York|pages=|oclc=830668272}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she was a grandchild of Henry Morgenthau, she is referring to herself, which is confirmed in her later book ''Practicing History'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7460683|title=Practicing history : selected essays|last=1912-1989.|first=Tuchman, Barbara W. (Barbara Wertheim),|date=1981|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|isbn=0394520866|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=7460683}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she tells the story of her father, [[Maurice Wertheim]], traveling from Constantinople to [[Jerusalem]] on August 29, 1914, to deliver funds to the Jewish community there. Thus, at two, Tuchman was present during the pursuit of ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'', which she documented 48 years later.

Wertheim was influenced at an early age by the books of [[Lucy Fitch Perkins]] and [[G.A. Henty]], as well as the historical novels of [[Alexandre Dumas]].&lt;ref name="Pollack" /&gt; She attended the [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden School]] on Manhattan's Upper West Side.&lt;ref name="bankruptcy"&gt;Douglas Martin, [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/23/nyregion/walden-school-at-73-files-for-bankruptcy.html Walden School, At 73, Files for Bankruptcy], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 23, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; She received her Bachelor of Arts from [[Radcliffe College]] in 1933, having studied history and literature.&lt;ref name="Pollack" /&gt;

==Researcher and journalist==

Following graduation, Wertheim worked as a volunteer research assistant at the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]] in New York, spending a year in [[Tokyo]] in 1934-35, including a month in [[China]], before returning to the United States via the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to [[Moscow]] and on to [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt; She also contributed to ''The Nation'' as a correspondent until her father's sale of the publication in 1937, traveling to [[Valencia]] and [[Madrid]] to cover the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/07/obituaries/barbara-tuchman-dead-at-77-a-pulitzer-winning-historian.html Barbara Tuchman Dead at 77; A Pulitzer-Winning Historian]. [[The New York Times]], February 7, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; A first book resulted from her Spanish experience, ''The Lost British Policy: Britain and Spain Since 1700,'' published in 1938.

In 1940 Wertheim married Lester R. Tuchman (taking his surname), an [[internal medicine|internist]], medical researcher and professor of [[clinical medicine]] at [[Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in [[Manhattan]]. They had three daughters, including [[Jessica Mathews]], who became president of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E2D81E3FF93AA25751C1A961958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Lester+Tuchman&amp;st=nyt |title=Lester Tuchman, Internist and Professor, 93|publisher=New York Times |date=1997-12-19 |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years of [[World War II]], Tuchman worked in the [[Office of War Information]].&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt; Following the war, Tuchman spent the next decade working to raise the children while doing basic research for what would ultimately become the 1956 book ''Bible and Sword: England and Palestine from the Bronze Age to Balfour.''&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt;

With the publication of ''Bible and Sword'' in 1956, Tuchman dedicated herself to historical research and writing, turning out a new book approximately every four years.&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt; Rather than feeling hampered by the lack of an advanced degree in history, Tuchman argued that freedom from the rigors and expectations of academia was actually liberating, as the norms of academic writing would have "stifled any writing capacity."&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt;

Tuchman favored a literary approach to the writing of history, providing eloquent explanatory narratives rather than concentration upon discovery and publication of fresh archival sources. In the words of one biographer, Tuchman was "not a historian's historian; she was a layperson's historian who made the past interesting to millions of readers".&lt;ref&gt;The words are those of Oliver B. Pollack in Paula E. Hyman and Deborah Dash Moore (eds.), ''Jewish Women in America: An Historical Encyclopedia,'' pg. 1415.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuchman's storytelling prowess was rewarded in 1963 when she received the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for her book ''The Guns of August,'' dealing with the behind-the-scenes political machinations which led to the eruption of [[World War I]] in the summer of 1914.

In 1971, Tuchman received the [[St. Louis Literary Award]] from the [[Saint Louis University]] Library Associates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slu.edu/libraries/associates/award.html Website of St. Louis Literary Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |title=Recipients of the Saint Louis Literary Award |work= |author=Saint Louis University Library Associates |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731082313/http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |archive-date=July 31, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuchman received a second Pulitzer in 1972 for her biography of [[Joseph Stilwell]], ''[[Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45|Stilwell and the American Experience in China]].''

In 1978, Tuchman was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter T|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterT.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the first female president of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=NYT022779&gt;{{cite news |first=Nan |last=Robertson |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/27/archives/barbara-tuchman-a-loner-at-the-top-of-her-field-couldnt-agree-more.html |title=Barbara Tuchman: A Loner at the Top of Her Field |work=New York Times |date=Feb 27, 1979 |accessdate=Jun 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won a U.S. [[National Book Award]] [[List of winners of the National Book Award#History|in History]]&lt;ref&gt;This was the 1980 [[List of winners of the National Book Award#History|award for paperback History]]. From 1980 to 1983 in [[National Book Award#History|National Book Award history]] there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories, and [[National Book Award for Nonfiction#nonfiction categories|multiple nonfiction subcategories]]. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including this one.&lt;/ref&gt; for the first paperback edition of ''[[A Distant Mirror]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref name=nba1980&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1980 |title=1980 National Book Awards Winners and Finalists, The National Book Foundation |publisher=Nationalbook.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1980 the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) selected Tuchman for the [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]]. Tuchman's lecture was entitled "Mankind's Better Moments".&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html |title=Jefferson Lecture &amp;#124; National Endowment for the Humanities |publisher=Neh.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuchman was a [[trustee]] of Radcliffe College and a lecturer at Harvard, the [[University of California]], and the [[Naval War College]]. Although she never received a formal graduate degree in history, Tuchman was the recipient of a number of honorary degrees from leading American universities, including [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[New York University]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Boston University]], and [[Smith College]], among others.&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
She died in 1989 in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], following a [[stroke]],&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt; at 77.

A tower of [[Currier House (Harvard College)|Currier House]], a residential division first of Radcliffe College and now of Harvard College, was named in her honor.

==Tuchman's Law&lt;!--'Tuchman's Law' redirects here--&gt;==

In the introduction to her 1978 book ''A Distant Mirror,'' Tuchman playfully identified a historical phenomenon which she termed "Tuchman's Law," to wit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Disaster is rarely as pervasive as it seems from recorded accounts. The fact of being on the record makes it appear continuous and ubiquitous whereas it is more likely to have been sporadic both in time and place. Besides, persistence of the normal is usually greater than the effect of the disturbance, as we know from our own times. After absorbing the news of today, one expects to face a world consisting entirely of strikes, crimes, power failures, broken water mains, stalled trains, school shutdowns, muggers, drug addicts, neo-Nazis, and rapists. The fact is that one can come home in the evening — on a lucky day — without having encountered more than one or two of these phenomena. This has led me to formulate Tuchman's Law, as follows: "The fact of being reported multiplies the apparent extent of any deplorable development by five- to tenfold" (or any figure the reader would care to supply).&lt;ref name=Mirror&gt;Tuchman, Barbara  ''A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century.'' New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1978; pg. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tuchman's Law has been defined as a psychological principle of "perceptual readiness" or "subjective probability".&lt;ref&gt;Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences, ''Violence and the Violent Individual: Proceedings of the Twelfth Annual Symposium, Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences, Houston, Texas, November 1–3, 1979.'' Spectrum Publications, pg. 412&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bestshoring''', also known as rightshoring, is the process of identifying the best location to move [[manufacturing]], [[Information technology|IT]] or [[business]] processes for a company. The decision is to be based on quantifiable criteria which are intended to take subjective and [[political]] input out of the [[decision cycle]]. Many companies use external [[consulting firm]]s to make these decisions.

On August 1, 2004, [[Hillary Clinton]] wrote an article explaining why bestshoring beats [[outsourcing]]. Her argument is that "[[Foreign labor]] isn't as cheap as it seems."

The '''Changi Business Park''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''CBP'''; {{lang-ms|Taman Perniagaan Changi}}; [[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 樟宜商业园; {{lang-ta|சாங்கி பிஸினஸ் பார்க்}}) is a [[business park]] located in [[Changi]] South, in the eastern part of [[Singapore]].

==Launch==
Launched in July 1997, the 66-[[hectare]] or  Changi Business Park is [[JTC Corporation]]'s second business park following the [[International Business Park]] in [[Jurong East]]. The Changi Business Park comprises a mix of [[high technology]] business, [[data]] and [[software]] enterprises, [[research and development]] divisions and [[knowledge]] intensive facilities.

The Changi Business Park is located near to [[Changi Airport]], the Aviation Distri-Zone and logistics facilities. This simplifies transportation and logistics arrangements for businesses leading to significant cost savings. 

The business park is also close to [[Singapore Expo]], one of South East Asia’s largest exhibition centres and easily accessible to the Central Business District by rail via the [[Expo MRT Station]] and by road via the [[Pan Island Expressway]] and the [[East Coast Parkway]]. 

Completed in 2012, a large area of 71.07-hectare Changi Business Park would open as a [[mixed-use development]] project. Comprising a retail shopping mall, office building, and hotel building, the project was redeveloped by a joint venture between Ascendas Land and Frasers Centerpoint. Construction of the project was undertaken by Japanese general construction contractor [[Nakano Corporation]].

Investors can lease land sites from JTC Corporation to construct their facilities.

==Career==
Before joining the Curtis Publishing Company, Parlin acted as a schoolteacher in the state of Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of qualitative research methods in marketing |last=W. Belk |first=Russell |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=5 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wikcliAq_SMC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22Charles+Coolidge+Parlin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BvIcTbTgGI6osQOc_MiiAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Charles%20Coolidge%20Parlin%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, he was hired by the Curtis Publishing Company in a job that had no clearly defined title, as the work he was doing had not previously been done.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, S.E., ''Market Research: Text and Cases,'' 2nd ed., Himalaya Publishing House, 2014, &lt;Online: www.himpub.com/documents/Chapter873.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Parlin came up with the name "commercial research" for his work, which would later end up being changed to market research. The company had just bought out the magazine, [[Country Gentleman]], but the owner of the company, [[Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis]], had little knowledge about agriculture. Since much of the advertising in the ''Country Gentleman'' magazine was purchased by the agriculturalists, Parlin began researching agriculture in general. After six months of interviews with a number of people in the industry, he completed a 460-page survey that "revealed unsuspected facts about where agricultural tools were made, to whom they were sold, when, and where."&lt;ref name="Americans"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Americans, the democratic experience |last=Joseph Boorstin |first=Daniel |authorlink= |year=1974 |publisher=Random House, Inc |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RicRyr47FMgC&amp;pg=PT218&amp;dq=%22Charles+Coolidge+Parlin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_OUcTePmBpS8sAOZqpXxCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Charles%20Coolidge%20Parlin%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, Parlin carried out a study on "the market for almost everything in the nation's one hundred largest cities," which involved 1,121 interviews across the nation, compiling all of the fuindings in order to draw conclusions about the workings of the national market. His "pioneer report", ''Department Store Lines'', was released in 1912 and it focused on the distinctions between convenience goods and shopping goods and how the marketer should focus on selling primarily shopping goods in order to obtain the highest profits.&lt;ref name="Americans" /&gt;

In 1914, Parlin released a five-volume study titled ''Automobiles''. It focused on the future of the automobile age and "collected facts on manufacturing and distribution, on the influence of women on automobile purchase". The study predicted correctly that the number of grades and makes would be reduced in the future and it "envisaged the dimensions and even the shape of the automobile market." This information resulted in an increase in advertising by automobile manufacturers, in order to obtain customers faster than their competitors in the burgeoning market for automobiles.&lt;ref name="Americans" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Technology as magic: the triumph of the irrational |last=Stivers |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location= |isbn= |page=88 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gO12jZ_m9LYC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Charles+Coolidge+Parlin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0PccTb70JomosAOMhOGyAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Charles%20Coolidge%20Parlin%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Largely due to Parlin's success, other commercial organisations began creating Departments of Commercial Research including: [[United States Rubber Company]] in 1915 and [[Swift and Company]] in 1916. Foreseeing a need for "standardized definitions and common measures" after the release of Parlin's studies, the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (North America)|Audit Bureau of Circulations]] was formed in 1914 in order to regulate publisher's claims for newspaper and magazine circulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The SAGE handbook of marketing theory |last=Maclaran |first=Pauline |authorlink= |author2=Tadajewski, Mark |author3=Stern, Barbara |author4= Saren, Michael  |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location= |isbn= |page=76 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VyCnacSPg0oC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=%22Charles+Coolidge+Parlin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=k_UcTYuDGpK6sQOVitWjAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwATgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Charles%20Coolidge%20Parlin%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, Parlin went on to found the "first commercial research company" with [[Donald M.

==Legacy==
The ''Charles Coolidge Parlin Marketing Research Award'' was established in 1945 by "the Philadelphia Chapter of the AMA and The Wharton School in association with the Curtis Publishing Company to honor persons who have made outstanding contributions to the field of marketing research." It is meant to act as a memorial to Parlin, due to his creation of the field of market research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themarketingfoundation.org/parlin.html |title=Charles Coolidge Parlin Marketing Research Award |author= |work= |publisher=[[American Marketing Association]] |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''contingent contract''' is an [[if-then]] agreement that states which actions under certain conditions will result in specific outcomes (Thompson 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;122). Contingent contracts usually occur when [[negotiating]] parties fail to reach an agreement. The [[contract]] is characterized as "contingent" because the terms are not final and are based on certain events or conditions occurring. (Malhotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;70).

A contingent contract can also be viewed as protection against a future change of plans (Malhotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;70). Contingent contracts can also lead to effective agreement when each party has different time preferences. For example, one party may desire immediate payoffs, while the other party may be interested in more long-term payoffs (Thompson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;122). Further, contingency contracts can foster an agreement in negotiations involving resolute differences of expectations about the future (Malhotra, Baerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;69).

==Use==

Contingent contracts can be used in many types of settings such as work, school, home, etc. In regards to work, a common example of contingent contracts comes in the form of job negotiations. It usually involves the opportunity to discuss [[salary]], position, promotion, etc. However, contingent contracts can often include negotiations regarding [[flextime]], [[job sharing]], responsibilities, etc. Although contingent contracts concerning employment packages are more the exception than the norm, these types of negotiations can be very successful, allowing both parties to walk away feeling very satisfied with the newly agreed upon arrangement (Krutzberg, Naquin 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;86-87).

The following examples are everyday agreements that may occur in the [[workplace]]:
* The [[employee]] and [[employer]] agree on a 1% bonus increase at the end of the year if the employee receives all excellent marks on her performance review.
* The employee will be allowed to work two days a week from home after having worked at the company for one year, and if he submits all reports on time.
* The employee will receive full insurance coverage after having worked at the company for one full year, with less than five sick days.

The following example illustrates a behavioral contract between a [[teenager]] and [[parent]]s to be used in the home:
* The teenager agrees to attend all classes, complete homework on time, return home before curfew, communicate with parents in a respectful manner, etc.
* If the teenager violates any of the agreed upon rules, he will choose to suffer the consequences which involve being grounded, no television or Internet, not using the family car, etc.
* The parents agree that if the teenager performs the agreed upon behaviors, then the teenager will be able to keep his privileges.

A contingent contract can be used to create enormous benefit to both parties. One advantage would be that it limits the loss that would occur if the contract failed. Another would be that it wouldn't make one party gain more at the expense of the other. This leads to an increase in trust between both parties, which would allow them to have more beneficial negotiations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazerman|first1=M. H.|last2=Gillespie|first2=J. J.|title=Betting on the Future: The Virtues of Contingent Contracts|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=1999|volume=77 |issue=5|pages= 155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
In order to be most effective, contingent contracts should possess some of the following characteristics:
* The objectives for each party involved must be aligned (Thompson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;124).
* The promise is based on an uncertain event: the action required of one party is only dependent upon the occurrence of some event in the future (Sharma 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;87).
* The event must be minor to the contract: the performance of a promise is not the event; rather it is part of the contract (Sharma 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;87).
* The event is independent of the promising party: the occurrence of an event is not controlled by the promising party’s will or desire (Sharma 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;87).
* The agreements should be formalized in writing with appropriate legal counsel (Thompson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;124).
* The parties must mutually decide how the terms of agreement will be measured (Thompson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;124).
A contingency contract can also be viewed as protection against a future change of plans

==Value==
Necessary is because the contract is built on expected differences from each party. Each party can leverage their differences through bets that lead to both sides winning (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;69). However, contingent contracts do not increase integrative value, rather they affect distribution value (Brett 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;74). Contingency contracts can create value by causing each negotiating party to stop arguing about their different beliefs. Both parties will be better off because they are each confident in their beliefs, ideas or projections (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;69).

==Risks and challenges==
Contingency contracts can be beneficial for both parties by producing value and motivating performance, however there are some situations in which contingency contracts are not the best solution (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;70). Here are some limitations (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;71):
* Contingency contracts could be threatening if the other party possesses or has access to more valuable information than you. For example, it would be unfair if one party wanted to bet on the basis of ratings because they have better access to that information.
* Contingency contracts can be risky if both parties are not in agreement of how to measure objectively. For example, define clearly what it means to promote an employee "if she does well" because each party may have different ideas or opinions about whether the contract has been met. This can lead to disagreement, which can cause great distress to the relationship between the parties (Brett 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;74).
* Contingency contracts can be dangerous if there are unequal incentives for each party. For example, there should be incentives for both parties to act in ways that are compatible with your agreement, thereby creating a win-win situation for both parties.

It generally costs money in the form of membership dues, though some spaces are free of charge.

Coworking is not only about the physical place, but about establishing a community. Indeed, its rapid growth has been seen as a possible way for city planners to address the decline of high street retail in urban centres&lt;ref&gt;Paul Carder in Work&amp;Place Journal http://www.workandplace.com/coworking-or-coffee-shops-re-invigorating-the-town-centre/&lt;/ref&gt;. Its benefits can already be experienced outside of the physical spaces, and it is recommended to start with building a coworking community first before considering opening a Coworking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Space Catalyst: Getting Started |website=Coworking wiki |url=http://wiki.coworking.org/w/page/16583957/Space%20Catalyst%3A%20Getting%20Started}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some coworking places don't build a community; they just get a part of an existing one by combining their opening with an event which attracts their target group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=7 tips for a successful co-working space |first=Carsten |last=Foertsch |date=2010-09-01 |website=Deskmag |url=http://www.deskmag.com/en/how-a-coworking-space-succeeds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real-estate centric coworking spaces are about selling desks first, with building community as a secondary goal. Players target freelance professionals, remote workers, and small to medium enterprises (SMEs) who need a space and seek a community with a collaborative spirit. Customers also often benefit from professional services such as printing or incorporation or consulting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  The Future of Coworking: coworking visas, corporate partnerships and real-estate specialists | work = Martin Pasquier |  publisher = Innovation Is Everywhere | url = http://www.innovationiseverywhere.com/future-coworking-coworking-visas-corporate-partnerships-real-estate-specialists/| accessdate = 2015-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coworking is distinct from business accelerators, [[business incubators|incubators]] and [[Executive suite|executive suites]].&lt;ref&gt;DeGuzman, Genevieve [http://www.deskmag.com/en/five-big-myths-about-coworking-169// ''Five Big Myths About Coworking.''] Deskmag. 1 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These spaces do not fit into the coworking model because they often miss the social, collaborative, and informal aspects of the process.

==History==
[[File:Citizen Space, San Francisco, CA.jpg|thumb|250px|''Citizen Space'' in San Francisco]]
Between 2006 and 2015, a few studies have shown the number of coworking spaces and available seats have roughly doubled each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of Coworking: coworking visas, corporate partnerships and real-estate specialists|url=http://www.innovationiseverywhere.com/future-coworking-coworking-visas-corporate-partnerships-real-estate-specialists/|work= Martin Pasquier|publisher= Innovation Is Everywhere| accessdate=2015-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brad Neuberg is credited with starting the coworking movement in San Francisco in 2005 with the idea to combine the independence of freelancing with the structure and community of an office space.  To do this, he invented the word "coworking" with no hyphen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fost|first1=Dan|title=They're Working on Their Own, Just Side by Side|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/20/business/businessspecial2/20cowork.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coworking how we experience it today was preceded by European hacker spaces of the 1990s, where programmers would exchange skills and best practices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laura|first1=Bliss|title=How WeWork Has Perfectly Captured the Millennial Id|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/wework-the-perfect-manifestation-of-the-millennial-id/550922/|website=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Some coworking places&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 of the best co-working spaces in the UK |url=http://www.creativeboom.co.uk/boom-basics/10-of-the-best-co-working-spaces-in-the-uk/ |last=Cowan |first=Katy |date=2010-04-22 |website=Creative Boom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424062628/http://www.creativeboom.co.uk/boom-basics/10-of-the-best-co-working-spaces-in-the-uk/ |archivedate=24 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were developed by nomadic Internet [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]] seeking an alternative to working in [[Coffeehouse|coffee shops]] and cafes, or to isolation in independent or home offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=https://www.freeofficefinder.com/article/co-working-office-etiquette-tips |title=10 Tips on Etiquette in the Co-Working Office |work=Free Office Finder |date=Jul 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2007 survey showed that many employees worry about feeling isolated and losing human interaction if they were to [[Telecommuting|telecommute]]. Roughly a third of both private-sector and public-sector workers also reported that they did not want to stay at home during work. A major factor that drives demand for coworking is the growing part of independent workers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broadbent|first1=Andrew|title=Why Big Corporations Are Moving Into Coworking Spaces|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/307085|website=Entrepreneur|publisher=Entrepreneur|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===In Asia===

In Hong Kong for example, dozens of coworking spaces have been set up to foster the rapidly growing startup community; according to ''[[Forbes]]'' it is among the leading tech locations in the world, along with [[Silicon Valley]] and [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|Malaysian state]] of [[Penang]], long regarded as the ''Silicon Valley of the East'', has also witnessed an increase in coworking spaces.&lt;ref name=":57"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/a-silicon-valley-of-the-east-penang-s-thriving-start-up-communit-7576346|title=A Silicon Valley of the East: Penang’s thriving start-up community|last=Lianne Chia|first=|date=26 January 2017|work=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|access-date=27 May 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penangmonthly.com/article.aspx?pageid=10148&amp;name=is_penang_ready_for_the_coworking_movement?|title=Is Penang Ready for the Coworking Movement?|website=Is Penang Ready for the Coworking Movement?,|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from privately-owned [[Startup company|startups]], the [[Government of Penang|Penang state government]] has embarked on a drive to convert colonial-era buildings in the capital city of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] into coworking spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/repopulating-george-town-coworking-coliving-spaces|title=‘Repopulating’ George Town via co-working, co-living spaces|last=|first=|date=18 April 2018|work=[[The Edge (Malaysia)|The Edge]]|access-date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-thirds are men, one third are women. Four in five coworkers started their career with a university education. The majority of coworkers work in [[creative industries]] or [[new media]]. Slightly more than half of all coworkers are freelancers.

There are 200-odd companies offering shared office spaces in India and a sizeable chunk of them still identify themselves as startup-focused spaces. However, more providers of co-working spaces—including Awfis Space Solutions, 91Springboard, InstaOffice, WhyWorks and BHIVE Workspace as well as global companies like WeWork—are positioning themselves as enterprise-focused facilities. &lt;ref&gt;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/why-the-co-working-industry-gravitating-towards-large-companies-and-smes/articleshow/63038041.cms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/plan/how-freelancers-corporates-startups-can-benefit-from-shared-workspaces/articleshow/58762652.cms|title=How freelancers, corporates, startups can benefit from shared workspaces|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] is among{{Weasel inline|date=July 2018}} the most responsive European country to the idea of collaborative working, with a special focus on London.  The city leads the coworking market, not only for the large number of coworking places it offers but also for the variety of places that exist to fit the differing needs among start-ups, entrepreneurs and freelancers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} [[Camden Collective]] is a regeneration project in London that re-purposes previously vacant and underused properties that opened its first ‘wire-less, wall-less’ coworking space in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2a843076-4a6f-11e5-b558-8a9722977189.html#axzz3qWfNZuwH "London’s Camden reinvents itself as hub for emerging businesses"], ''Financial Times'' (paywall).&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, the U.K. Government announced it would be applying coworking principles to a new pilot scheme for its 'One Public Sector Estate' strategy covering 12 local authorities in England, which will encourage councils to work with central government departments and other bodies so that staff share buildings. This will enable the authorities to encourage collaboration as well as re-use or release property and land deemed surplus to requirements, cutting spending and freeing up land for local development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://officeinsight.org/uk-government-announces-details-of-one-public-sector-estate-scheme/ Insight: UK Government announces details of One Public Sector Estate scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coworking is also becoming more common in continental Europe, with the [[Startup company|startup]] metropolis [[Berlin]] being a major booster for this development. Several diverse offers can be found in the city, such as [[Factory Berlin]].

This kind of working environment is not exclusive to big cities. Smaller urban areas with many young and creative people and especially [[College town|university cities]] may offer coworking places, with ''Cowork [[Greifswald]]'' in Germany being one example. Cooperation between coworking spaces and academic environments are focused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deskmag.com/en/will-coworking-spaces-be-the-new-classrooms-university-school-686 deskmag] ''Will Coworking Spaces Be The New Classrooms?'', 2013-01-30&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emil Stock''' (1868–1951) was a [[Croatia]]n industrialist and businessman.

Stock was born in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] on 3 August 1868 to Abramo and Gentile ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Valenzin) Stock, as one of 12 children. Stock's paternal [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[Jews in Croatia|Jewish]] family originated from [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[German Empire]], while his maternal [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] Jewish family arrived in Split during [[Napoleonic era]]. His father moved to Split in 1844 from [[Trieste]], [[Italy]]. Stock graduated from university with a civil engineering degree. After graduation he built a cement factory near [[Solin]], and also a factory of asbestos-cement products. At the beginning of the 1900s Stock became involved in the production of [[alcoholic]] beverages. In 1905 Stock , along  with [[Vid Morpurgo]], another Croatian Jewish industrialist, founded the alcoholic beverages company "Morpurgo, Stock e Comp." Stock 84 was being produced in the Split-based old Morpurgo factory. The new company obtained the franchise to construct a new [[liquor]] factory on the outskirts of Split (today part of the city). The factory concession was subsequently challenged by the municipal prefect [[Vicko Mihaljević]] , ostensibly due to environmental issues, while some attributed the problem to a political conflict between the owners and the municipal authorities. Disappointed  by the withdrawal of the concession, Stock and Morpurgo went on to build the factory in [[Rovinj]], Croatia. The business was prosperous so Stock and his partner decided to build a second plant in Trieste, where Stock's brother [[Lionello Stock|Lionel]] already owned the steam wine distillery "Distilleria a vapore Camis &amp; Stock" (now [[Fernet Stock]]) which produced cognac "Medicinal". Stock died in Trieste in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bašić|first=Želimir|coauthors=|title=Prva tvornica "Stock" bila je u Splitu|pages=|publisher=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|date=|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20030308/feljton01.asp|accessdate=2013-05-28|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Šilović|first=Meri|coauthors=|title=Stock je zapravo "splitsko dite"|pages=|publisher=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|date=|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20061113/mozaik01.asp|accessdate=2013-05-28|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Stock, Emilio|pages=|publisher=[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]|date=|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/emilio-stock_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/|accessdate=2013-05-31|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6836">{{UStaxation}}
Under the [[U.S. tax code]], businesses expenditures can be deducted from the total [[taxable income]] when filing income taxes if a taxpayer can show the funds were used for business-related activities,&lt;ref&gt;IRC § 162. Section 212 permits deductions for investment expenses.&lt;/ref&gt; not personal&lt;ref&gt;IRC § 262.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[capital expense]]s (i.e., long-term, tangible assets, such as property).&lt;ref name="IRC § 263a"&gt;IRC § 263(a).&lt;/ref&gt;  Capital expenditures either create [[cost basis]] or add to a preexisting cost basis and cannot be deducted in the year the taxpayer pays or incurs the expenditure.&lt;ref name="IRC § 263a"/&gt;

In terms of its accounting treatment, an expense is recorded immediately and impacts directly the income statement of the company, reducing its net profit. In contrast, a capital expenditure is [[Capital_expenditure|capitalized]], recorded as an asset and depreciated over time.

== Four ways costs can be capital expenditures ==
The [[Internal Revenue Code]], [[Treasury regulations|Treasury Regulations]] (including new regulations proposed in 2006), and case law set forth a series of guidelines that help to distinguish expenses from capital expenditures, although in reality distinguishing between these two types of costs can be extremely difficult.  In general, four types of costs related to tangible property must be capitalized:&lt;ref&gt;For more on this subject, see Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials 170-92 (2d ed. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Costs that produce a benefit that will last substantially beyond the end of the taxable year.&lt;ref&gt;Prop. Reg. § 1.263(a)-2(d)(4)(i).&lt;/ref&gt;

2. New assets that have a useful life substantially beyond one year.&lt;ref name="IRC § 263a"/&gt;   For example, in ''Commissioner v. Idaho Power Co''.,&lt;ref&gt;418 U.S. 1 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; the taxpayer used its own equipment to construct and improve various facilities that it owned.  The taxpayer sought to have the depreciation of the construction equipment treated as a deduction.  The Court held that because the equipment was used to invest in a capital asset – the new and improved facilities – the costs had to be treated as capital expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;This result was codified in IRC § 263A, the uniform capitalization (or UNICAP) rules.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Improvements that prolong the life of the property,&lt;ref&gt;Prop. Reg. § 1.263(a)-3(f)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; restore property to a “like-new” condition, or add value to the property.&lt;ref&gt;Prop. Reg. § 1.263(a)-3(d)(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in ''Fedex Corp. v. United States'',&lt;ref&gt;291 F. Supp. 2d 699 (W.D. Tenn. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; the taxpayer performed repairs upon jet engines by removing them from the airplane and then having parts replaced.  The taxpayer argued that these expenses were deductible, but the IRS stated that the costs should be capitalized.  The court held that the inspection and replacement costs could be deducted because the improvements did not add to the value and did not prolong the life of the airplanes as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Prop. Reg. § 1.263(a)-3(d)(2)(v) sets forth nine factors to use when determining whether an item should be treated as an individual piece of property or as part of a whole.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Midland Empire Packing Co. v. Commissioner'',&lt;ref&gt;14 T.C. 635 (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;  the taxpayer added a concrete lining to its basement floor to prevent oil from seeping into where the taxpayer stored meat.  The taxpayer argued that the costs of installation were deductible and the tax court agreed.  The costs of installation only permitted the taxpayer to continue the plant’s operation.  The expenses did not add to the value of the business or permit the taxpayer to make new uses of the basement.

4. Adaptations that permit the property to be used for a new or different purpose.  In contrast to ''Midland Empire Packing Co.'', in ''[[Mt. Morris Drive-In Theatre Co. v. Commissioner]]'',&lt;ref&gt;25 T.C. 272 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt;  under threat of litigation, the taxpayer was forced to create a new drainage system to prevent run-off rainwater from flooding his neighbor's farm.  The taxpayer argued that these costs were deductible, but the tax court disagreed.  Because the taxpayer knew in advance the property had an inadequate drainage system, the costs to accomplish this adaptation of the property were a capital expenditure.  The costs were not simply an improvement of the preexisting drainage system, but rather a completely new addition to the property that permitted the taxpayer to use the property as a drive-in theater.
&lt;br /&gt;

Though it is an oversimplification, when trying to distinguish between expenses and capital expenditures it can be helpful to remember that the U.S. tax code attempts to levy tax on those most able to pay it.

== Illustrative Example ==
Imagine that a business buys a truck for $50,000 and uses $5,000 this year on gasoline to distribute tomatoes upon which it earned $20,000.  If we want to apportion tax on the business according to its abilities to pay we should ask, "how much better off is the businesses businesses in Year One?"  It seems unfair to say that the business is $20,000 better off than at the beginning of the year - after all it spent $55,000 to earn those $20,000.  However, it also seems unfair to say that the business is $35,000 worse off (the $20,000 earned minus the $55,000 spent) – after all it also has a truck which it will use for years to come.  

Probably the fairest characterization is to say that in Year One the business earned $20,000, spent $5,000 on gas, and "spent" some (but not all) of the value of the truck it purchased.  Since the $5,000 on gas was consumed in Year One and all of its value has been provided during Year One its full cost is properly offset against the income of Year One.  In other words it is an ''expense'', and it is recorded right away as such.  On the other hand, the truck will contribute to income in Year One, but also contribute to income in future years.  Since the truck’s benefits are spread over the years that the truck is in use, we will want to spread the cost of the truck over those subsequent years as well.  Otherwise the business would appear overly burdened in Year One and unnaturally profitable every year thereafter.  Thus the truck is a ''capital expenditure'' which should be depreciated.  However, keep in mind that while depreciation spreads the cost of a capital asset over several years (for tax purposes) it is not intended to actually mirror the real world wear and tear on the asset.

The '''''Finance Business Daily''''' ({{lang-sl|Poslovni dnevnik Finance}}; ''Finance'' meaning ''Finances'') is the only daily [[Slovenia]]n business and financial newspaper. The idea to publish it had already been proposed by [[Iztok Jurančič]] before 1991, when Slovenia declared its independence. However, it was realized only in 1992. At first, the newspaper was published by the company Gospodarski Vestnik. Today, it is published by the Časnik Finance company, which is owned by the Swedish [[Bonnier Group]] and also publishes several other publications; for example, the magazines ''[[Manager (magazine)|Manager]]'' and ''Moje finance'', the healthcare newspaper ''Medicina danes'', and the web portals ''Finance'' and ''Mojevro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cek.ef.uni-lj.si/u_diplome/antoncic4299.pdf |title=Uvajanje CRM-sistema v založniškem podjetju |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Introduction of the CRM System in a Publishing Company |first=Goran |last=Antončič |date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, the Finance Business Daily accounted for three quarter of the Časnik Finance company income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cek.ef.uni-lj.si/u_diplome/milic4048.pdf |title=Ocenjevanje vrednosti blagovne znamke Finance |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Assessment of the Value of the Finance Trademark |first=Marja |last=Milić |date=October 2009 |publisher=Faculty of Economics, University of Ljubljana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming a daily newspaper in 2002, ''Finance'' was issued twice weekly.

==History==
The first issue of ''Finance'' was published on 20 May 1992.&lt;ref name=johnc/&gt; It is based in [[Ljubljana]].&lt;ref name=johnc&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martine Robinson Beachboard|author2=John C. Beachboard|title=Implications of Foreign Ownership on Journalistic Quality in a Post-Communist Society: The Case of Finance|journal=Informing Science Journal|date=2006|volume=9|url=http://www.inform.nu/Articles/Vol9/v9p143-162Beachboard83.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was initially a biweekly.&lt;ref name=johnc/&gt;&lt;ref name=lst&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovenia Newspapers Magazines Journals and Weeklies |url=http://www.ljubljanasloveniatravel.com/slovenia-newspapers-magazines-journals-and-weeklies.html |publisher=Ljubljana Slovenia Travel |accessdate=6 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216203832/http://ljubljanasloveniatravel.com/slovenia-newspapers-magazines-journals-and-weeklies.html |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, it had over 2,000 subscribers. In 1994, Gospodarski Vestnik appointed Peter Frankl as its director. In 1999, the company Časnik Finance was established. It was owned by Gospodarski Vestnik (50%), [[Dagens Industrie]] (45%), and several individuals (5%). The director of the company was Jurij Giacomelli. The internet version of the newspaper began in October 2000.

In 2002, ''Finance'' became a daily,&lt;ref name=lst/&gt; and the visual design changed as well. In 2005, the owner of the company Časnik Finance (99.59%) became Bonnier Business Press AB, previously called Dagens Industrie. In 2006 the owner appointed Peter Frankl as the director of Časnik Finance. He also remained the editor-at-large.

In 2003, ''Finance'' had a circulation of 10,000 copies.&lt;ref name=johnc/&gt; The 2007 circulation of the paper was 15,200 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media |url=http://www.ipaslovenija.org/eng/about/09_media.pdf |work=IPA Section Slovenia |accessdate=15 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128160754/http://www.ipaslovenija.org/eng/about/09_media.pdf |archivedate=28 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code of ethics==
The ''Finance'' journalists have passed an [[ethical code]], named the ''Code of the Journalists of the Finance Newspaper''. It mainly bases on the [[Code of Ethics of Slovene Journalists]], with the addition of several articles related to [[financial journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cek.ef.uni-lj.si/u_diplome/radovic3118.pdf |title=Prikrito oglaševanje v slovenskem medijskem prostoru |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Covert Advertising in the Slovenian Media Space |first=Jerneja |last=Radovič |date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Millennium Development Goals, UN Headquarters, New York City, New York - 20080501.jpg|thumb|A poster at [[United Nations Headquarters]] showing [[Millennium Development Goals]]]]

A '''goal''' is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envisions, [[Planning|plans]] and commits to achieve.&lt;ref name="Locke Latham 1990"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Locke |first1=Edwin A. |authorlink1=Edwin A. Locke |last2=Latham |first2=Gary P. |date=1990 |title=A theory of goal setting &amp; task performance |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |isbn=978-0139131387 |oclc=20219875}}&lt;/ref&gt; People endeavor to reach goals within a finite time by setting [[Time limit|deadline]]s.

A goal is roughly similar to a [[purpose]] or aim, the anticipated result which guides reaction, or an [[Intrinsic value (ethics)#End|end]], which is an [[object (philosophy)|object]], either a [[physical object]] or an [[abstract object]], that has [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]].

==Goal setting==
{{Main|Goal setting}}

Goal-setting theory was formulated based on [[empirical research]] and has been called one of the most important theories in organizational psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miner, J. B.|first=|date=2003|title=The rated importance, scientific validity, and practical usefulness of organizational behavior theories: A quantitative review|url=|journal=AOM Learning and Education|volume=2|issue=3|pages=250–268|via=|doi=10.5465/amle.2003.10932132}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin A. Locke]] and Gary P. Latham, the fathers of goal-setting theory, provided a comprehensive review of the core findings of the theory in 2002.&lt;ref name="Locke Latham 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Locke |first1=Edwin A. |authorlink1=Edwin A. Locke |last2=Latham |first2=Gary P. |date=September 2002 |origyear=2002 |title=Building a practically useful theory of goal setting and task motivation: a 35-year odyssey |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |volume=57 |issue=9 |pages=705–717 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.57.9.705|citeseerx=10.1.1.126.9922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, Locke and Latham found that specific, difficult goals lead to higher performance than either easy goals or instructions to "do your best", as long as [[feedback]] about progress is provided, the person is committed to the goal, and the person has the ability and knowledge to perform the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stajkovic |first1=Alexander D. |last2=Locke |first2=Edwin A. |authorlink2=Edwin A. Locke |last3=Blair |first3=Eden S. |date=September 2006 |title=A first examination of the relationships between primed subconscious goals, assigned conscious goals, and task performance |journal=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=1172–1180 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1172 |pmid=16953778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Locke and Latham, goals affect performance in the following ways:&lt;ref name="Locke Latham 2002" /&gt;
# goals direct attention and effort toward goal-relevant activities,
# difficult goals lead to greater effort,
# goals increase persistence, with difficult goals prolonging effort, and
# goals indirectly lead to [[arousal]], and to discovery and use of task-relevant knowledge and strategies.

A positive relationship between goals and performance depends on several factors. First, the goal must be considered important and the individual must be committed. Participative goal setting can help increase performance, but participation itself does not directly improve performance.&lt;ref name="Locke Latham 2002" /&gt; [[Self-efficacy]] also enhances goal commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stajkovic |first1=Alexander D. |last2=Luthans |first2=Fred |date=September 1998 |title=Self-efficacy and work-related performance: a meta-analysis |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=124 |issue=2 |pages=240–261 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.240}}&lt;/ref&gt; For goals to be effective, people need feedback that details their progress in relation to their goal.&lt;ref name="Locke Latham 2002" /&gt;

Some [[Coaching|coaches]] recommend establishing specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bounded ([[SMART criteria|SMART]]) objectives, but not all researchers agree that these [[SMART criteria]] are necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grant |first=Anthony M |title=An integrated model of goal-focused coaching: an evidence-based framework for teaching and practice |date=September 2012 |journal=International Coaching Psychology Review |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=146–165 (147) |url=http://coachingconsultinginternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/An-integrated-model-of-goal-focused-coaching-Grant-ICPR-2012.pdf |quote=Whilst the ideas represented by the acronym SMART are indeed broadly supported by goal theory (e.g. Locke, 1996), and the acronym SMART may well be useful in some instances in coaching practice, I think that the widespread belief that goals are synonymous with SMART action plans has done much to stifle the development of a more sophisticated understanding and use of goal theory within in the coaching community, and this point has important implications for coaching research, teaching and practice. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129080651/http://coachingconsultinginternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/An-integrated-model-of-goal-focused-coaching-Grant-ICPR-2012.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMART framework does not include goal difficulty as a criterion; in the goal-setting theory of Locke and Latham, it is recommended to choose goals within the 90th percentile of difficulty, based on the average prior performance of those that have performed the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locke, E. A., Chah, D., Harrison, S. &amp; Lustgarten, N.|first=|date=1989|title=Separating the effects of goal specificity from goal level|url=|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=43|issue=2|pages=270–287|via=|doi=10.1016/0749-5978(89)90053-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Locke Latham 2002" /&gt;

Goals can be long-term, intermediate, or short-term. The primary difference is the time required to achieve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Creek |first1=Jennifer |last2=Lougher |first2=Lesley |chapter=Goal setting |title=Occupational therapy and mental health |year=2008 |edition=4th |publisher=Churchill Livingstone Elsevier |location=Edinburgh; New York |isbn=9780443100277 |oclc=191890638 |pages=111–113 (112) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YnQAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112 |quote=Client goals are usually set on two or three levels. Long-term goals are the overall goals of the intervention, the reasons why the client is being offered help and the expected outcome of intervention... Intermediate goals may be clusters of skills to be developed, attitudes to be changed or barriers to be overcome on the way to achieving the main goals... Short-term goals are the small steps on the way to achieving major goals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term goals expect accomplishment in a short period of time, such as trying to get a bill paid in the next few days. The definition of a short-term goal need not relate to any specific length of time. In other words, one may achieve (or fail to achieve) a short-term goal in a day, week, month, year, etc. The time-frame for a short-term goal relates to its context in the overall time line that it is being applied to. For instance, one could measure a short-term goal for a month-long project in days; whereas one might measure a short-term goal for someone's lifetime in months or in years. Planners usually define short-term goals in relation to long-term goals.

=== Mindset theory of action phases ===
Before an individual can set out to achieve a goal, they must first decide on what their desired end-state will be. [[Peter Gollwitzer]]'s mindset theory of action phases proposes that there are two phases in which an individual must go through if they wish to achieve a goal.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M. (2012). Mindset theory of action phases. In P. A. M. Van Lange. A. W. Kruglanski, &amp; E. T. ''Handbook of motivation science'' (pp. 235–250). New York: [[Guilford Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; For the first phase, the individual will mentally select their goal by specifying the criteria and deciding on which goal they will set based on their commitment to seeing it through. The second phase is the planning phase, in which that individual will decide on which set of behaviors are at their disposal and will allow them to best reach their desired end-state or goal.&lt;ref&gt;Deckers, Lambert (2018). ''Motivation: biological, psychological, and environmental'' (5th ed.). New York: [[Routledge]]. pp. 342–348. {{ISBN|9781138036321}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal goals==
Individuals can [[personal goal setting|set personal goals]]. A student may set a goal of a high mark in an exam. An athlete might run five miles a day. A traveler might try to reach a destination-city within three hours. Financial goals are a common example, to save for retirement or to save for a purchase.

Managing goals can give returns in all areas of [[personal life]]. Knowing precisely what one wants to achieve makes clear what to concentrate and improve on, and often subconsciously prioritizes that goal. However, successful goal adjustment (goal disengagement and goal re-engagement capacities) is also a part of leading a healthy life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wrosch|first=Carsten|last2=Scheier|first2=Michael F.|last3=Miller|first3=Gregory E.|date=2013-12-01|title=Goal Adjustment Capacities, Subjective Well-Being, and Physical Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4145404/|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=7|issue=12|pages=847–860|doi=10.1111/spc3.12074|issn=1751-9004|pmc=4145404|pmid=25177358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goal setting]] and planning ("goal work") promotes long-term [[Vision statement|vision]], intermediate [[Mission statement|mission]] and short-term [[motivation]]. It focuses intention, [[Desire (emotion)|desire]], acquisition of knowledge, and helps to organize resources.

Efficient goal work includes recognizing and resolving all [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], inner conflict or limiting [[belief]] that might cause one to sabotage one's efforts. By setting clearly defined goals, one can subsequently measure and take pride in the accomplishment of those goals. One can see progress in what might have seemed a long, perhaps difficult, grind.

===Achieving personal goals===
Achieving complex and difficult goals requires focus, long-term diligence and effort (see [[Goal pursuit]]). Success in any field requires forgoing excuses and justifications for poor performance or lack of adequate planning; in short, success requires emotional maturity. The measure of belief that people have in their ability to achieve a personal goal also affects that achievement.

Long-term achievements rely on short-term achievements. [[Emotion]]al control over the small moments of the single day makes a big difference in the long term.

===Personal goal achievement and happiness===
There has been a lot of research conducted looking at the link between achieving desired goals, changes to self-efficacy and integrity and ultimately changes to [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Emmons |first=Robert A |chapter=Striving and feeling: personal goals and subjective well-being |editor1-last=Gollwitzer |editor1-first=Peter M. |editor1-link=Peter Gollwitzer |editor2-last=Bargh |editor2-first=John A |editor2-link=John Bargh |title=The psychology of action: linking cognition and motivation to behavior |year=1996 |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |location=New York |pages=313–337 |isbn=978-1572300323 |oclc=33103979 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1LQVSI9hfMC&amp;pg=PA313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goal efficacy refers to how likely an individual is to succeed in achieving their goal. Goal integrity refers to how consistent one's goals are with core aspects of the self. Research has shown that a focus on goal efficacy is associated with well-being factor happiness (subjective well-being) and goal integrity is associated with the well-being factor [[meaning (psychology)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McGregor |first1=Ian |last2=Little |first2=Brian R |title=Personal projects, happiness, and meaning: on doing well and being yourself |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |date=February 1998 |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=494–512 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.2.494 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13739275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple studies have shown the link between achieving long-term goals and changes in subjective well-being; most research shows that achieving goals that hold personal meaning to an individual increases feelings of subjective well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brunstein |first=Joachim C |title=Personal goals and subjective well-being: a longitudinal study |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |date=November 1993 |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=1061–1070 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.5.1061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=Andrew J |last2=Sheldon |first2=Kennon M |title=Avoidance personal goals and the personality–illness relationship |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |date=November 1998 |volume=75 |issue=5 |pages=1282–1299 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.5.1282|citeseerx=10.1.1.433.3924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sheldon |first1=Kennon M |last2=Kasser |first2=Tim |title=Pursuing personal goals: skills enable progress but not all progress is beneficial |journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] |date=December 1998 |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=1319–1331 |doi=10.1177/01461672982412006 |url=http://web.missouri.edu/~sheldonk/pdfarticles/PSPB98skills.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-concordance model==
The self-concordance model is a model that looks at the sequence of steps that occur from the commencement of a goal to attaining that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sheldon |first1= Ken M |last2= Eliott |first2= Andrew J |title= Goal striving, need satisfaction and longitudinal well-being: the self-concordance model |journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |date= March 1999 |volume= 76 |issue= 3 |pages= 482–497 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.76.3.482 |url= http://web.missouri.edu/~sheldonk/pdfarticles/JPSP99.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It looks at the likelihood and impact of goal achievement based on the type of goal and meaning of the goal to the individual.{{cn|date=February 2016}} Different types of goals impact both goal achievement and the sense of [[subjective well-being]] brought about by achieving the goal. The model breaks down factors that promote, first, striving to achieve a goal, then achieving a goal, and then the factors that connect goal achievement to changes in subjective well-being.

===Self-concordant goals===
Goals that are pursued to fulfill intrinsic values or to support an individual's self-concept are called self-concordant goals. Self-concordant goals fulfill basic needs and align with what [[psychoanalyst]] [[Donald Winnicott]] called an individual's "[[True Self]]". Because these goals have personal meaning to an individual and reflect an individual's self-identity, self-concordant goals are more likely to receive sustained effort over time. In contrast, goals that do not reflect an individual's internal drive and are pursued due to external factors (e.g. social pressures) emerge from a non-integrated region of a person and are therefore more likely to be abandoned when obstacles occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gollwitzer |first1= Peter M. |authorlink= Peter Gollwitzer |chapter= Action phases and mind-sets |editor1-last= Higgins |editor1-first= E Tory |editor2-last= Sorrentino |editor2-first= Richard M |title= Handbook of motivation and cognition: foundations of social behavior |year= 1990 |publisher= [[Guilford Press]] |location= New York |pages= 53–92 |volume= 2 |isbn= 978-0898624328 |oclc= 12837968 |chapterurl= http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/90Goll_ActionPhasesMindSets.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who attain self-concordant goals reap greater well-being benefits from their attainment. Attainment-to-well-being effects are mediated by need satisfaction, i.e., daily activity-based experiences of [[autonomy]], competence, and relatedness that accumulate during the period of striving. The model is shown to provide a satisfactory fit to 3 longitudinal data sets and to be independent of the effects of [[self-efficacy]], implementation intentions, avoidance framing, and [[life skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sheldon |first1= Kennon M |last2= Elliot |first2= Andrew J |title= Goal striving, need satisfaction, and longitudinal well-being: the self-concordance model |journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume= 76 |issue= 3 |date= March 1999 |pages= 482–497 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.76.3.482 |url= http://web.missouri.edu/~sheldonk/pdfarticles/JPSP99.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, [[self-determination theory]] and research surrounding this theory shows that if an individual effectively achieves a goal, but that goal is not self-endorsed or self-concordant, well-being levels do not change despite goal attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ryan |first= Richard M |title= Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being |journal= [[American Psychologist]] |date= January 2000 |volume= 55 |issue= 1 |pages= 68–78 |doi= 10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.68 |url= http://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2000_RyanDeci_SDT.pdf|citeseerx= 10.1.1.529.4370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goal management in organizations==
In [[organization]]s, goal management consists of the process of recognizing or inferring goals of individual [[team]]-members, abandoning goals that are no longer relevant, identifying and resolving conflicts among goals, and prioritizing goals consistently for optimal team-collaboration and effective operations.

For any successful [[commerce|commercial]] [[system]], it means deriving [[Profit (economics)|profits]] by making the best quality of [[good (accounting)|goods]] or the best quality of [[Service (economics)|services]] available to end-users ([[customer]]s) at the best possible [[cost]].{{cn|date=May 2017}} Goal management includes:
* assessment and dissolution of non-rational blocks to success
* [[time management]]
* frequent reconsideration (consistency checks)
* [[Feasibility study| feasibility]] checks
* adjusting [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] and main-goal targets

[[Jens Rasmussen (human factors expert)]] and Morten Lind distinguish three fundamental categories of goals related to technological system management:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rasmussen |first1= Jens |authorlink1= Jens Rasmussen (human factors expert) |last2= Lind |first2= Morten |chapter= A model of human decision making in complex systems and its use for design of system control strategies |title= Proceedings of the 1982 American Control Conference: Sheraton National Hotel, Arlington, Virginia, June 14–16, 1982 |publisher= [[American Automatic Control Council]] |date= 1982 |location= New York |oclc= 761373599 |chapterurl= http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/reports_INIS/RISOM2349.pdf}} Cited in: {{cite book |last= Wrench |first= Jason S |year= 2013 |chapter= Communicating within the modern workplace: challenges and prospects |editor-last= Wrench |editor-first= Jason S |title= Workplace communication for the 21st century: tools and strategies that impact the bottom line |location= Santa Barbara, CA |publisher= [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]] |pages= 1–38 |isbn= 978-0313396311 |oclc= 773022358 |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=xtg672jRCfAC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizational goal-management aims for individual employee goals and objectives to align with the vision and strategic goals of the entire organization. Goal-management provides organizations with a mechanism{{which?|date=May 2017}} to effectively communicate corporate goals and strategic objectives to each person across the entire organization.{{cn|date=May 2017}} The key consists of having it all emanate from a pivotal source and providing each person with a clear, consistent organizational-goal message so that every employee understands how their efforts contribute to an enterprise's success.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

An example of goal types in [[business management]]:

* Product goals: this refers to supplying an outstanding [[value proposition]] compared to other products - perhaps due to factors such as quality, design, reliability and novelty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Barnes |first1= Cindy |last2= Blake |first2= Helen |last3= Pinder |first3= David |title= Creating &amp; delivering your value proposition: managing customer experience for profit |year= 2009 |location= London; Philadelphia |publisher= [[Kogan Page]] |isbn= 9780749455125 |oclc= 320800660 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8d73CPt_khwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Operational goals: this refers to running the organization in such a way as to make the best use of [[management skills]], technology and resources
* Secondary goals: this refers to goals which an organization does not regard as priorities{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Goal displacement==
Goal displacement occurs when the original goals of an entity or organization are replaced over time by different goals. In some instances, this creates problems, because the new goals may exceed the capacity of the mechanisms put in place to meet the original goals. New goals adopted by an organization may also increasingly become focused on internal concerns, such as establishing and enforcing structures for reducing common employee disputes.&lt;ref name="Kirst-Ashman"&gt;Karen Kirst-Ashman, ''Human Behavior, Communities, Organizations, and Groups in the Macro Social Environment'' (2007), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the original goals of the organization become displaced in part by repeating behaviors that become traditional within the organization. For example, a company that manufactures widgets may decide to do seek good publicity by putting on a fundraising drive for a popular charity, or having a tent at a local county fair. If the fundraising drive or county fair tent is successful, the company may choose to make this an annual tradition, and may eventually involve more and more employees and resources in the new goal of raising the most charitable funds, or having the best county fair tent. In some cases, goals are displaced because the initial problem is resolved or the initial goal becomes impossible to pursue. A famous example is the [[March of Dimes]], which began as an organization to fund the fight against [[polio]], but once that disease was effectively brought under control by the [[polio vaccine]], transitioned to being an organization for combating [[birth defect]]s.&lt;ref name="Kirst-Ashman"/&gt;

The '''Great Fire of 1901''' was a conflagration that occurred in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], on May 3, 1901. It was one of the worst disasters in [[History of Florida|Florida history]] and the third largest urban fire in the U.S., next to the [[Great Chicago Fire]], and the [[1906 San Francisco fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2009-oct-the-great-jacksonville-fire-of-1901 |title=The Great Jacksonville Fire of 1901 |last=Davis |first=Ennis |date=2009-10-20 |website=Metro Jacksonville |language=en |access-date=2018-05-01 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire==

===Origin===
In 1901, Jacksonville was a city which consisted mainly of wooden buildings with wood shingled roofs. The city itself had been suffering under a prolonged drought,&lt;ref name="TImesUnion"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-55458480/like-the-phoenix-jacksonville-rose-from-the-ashes |title=Like the Phoenix, Jacksonville Rose from the Ashes after the Great Fire |last=Kerr |first=Jessie-Lynne |date=1999-05-02 |work=The Florida Times Union |access-date=2018-05-01 |language=en |via=Questia|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the building exteriors across the city dry and fire-prone.
At around noon on Friday, May 3, 1901, workers at the Cleaveland Fibre Factory, located on the corner of Beaver and Davis Streets, left for lunch. Several minutes later, sparks from the chimney of a nearby building started a fire in a pile of [[Spanish moss]] that had been laid out to dry. First, factory workers tried to put it out with a few buckets of water, as they had frequently done on similar occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.library.ufl.edu/spec/pkyonge/jacksonville/jaxfire2.html |title=The Fire! |website=The Great Fire of Jacksonville: An Artistic Description of a Gloomy Affair |publisher=University of Florida Library |access-date=2018-05-01|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the blaze was soon out of control due to the wind picking up out of the east.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Bill; Wood, Wayne W. (2001). ''The Great Fire of 1901''. Published by The Jacksonville Historical Society, Jacksonville, FL&lt;/ref&gt; A brisk northwest wind fanned the flames, which "spread from house to house, seemingly with the rapidity that a man could walk".&lt;ref name="TImesUnion" /&gt;
[[Image:Forsyth-st-ruins.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Forsyth Street ruins.]]
In eight hours, the fire burned 146 city blocks, destroyed more than 2,368 buildings, and left almost 10,000 residents homeless. It is said the glow from the flames could be seen in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia, and the smoke plumes in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=T. Frederick|title=History of Jacksonville Florida and Vicinity 1513 to 1924|year=1925|publisher=The Florida Historical Society|location=Florida Heritage Collection|pages=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Weldon Johnson, principal of a local school claimed, however, that firemen tried to save the fire from spreading to a white neighborhood, allowing black parts of town to burn down in the process:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We met many people fleeing. From them we gathered excitedly related snatches: the fiber factory catches afire - the fire department comes - fanned by a light breeze, the fire is traveling directly east and spreading out to the north, over the district where the bulk of Negroes in the western end of the city live - the firemen spend all their efforts saving a low row of frame houses just across the street on the south side of the factory, belonging to a white man named Steve Melton."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2014-feb-10-facts-about-jacksonvilles-black-history/page/3 |title=10 Facts About Jacksonville's Black History |last=Davis |first=Ennis |date=2014-02-10 |website=Metro Jacksonville |language=en |access-date=2018-01-10 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Aftermath===
Florida Governor [[William S. Jennings]] declared [[martial law]] in Jacksonville and dispatched several state [[militia]] units to help. Reconstruction began immediately, and the city was returned to civil authority on May 17. Seven human deaths were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Jacksonville Fire of 1901|url=https://www.floridamemory.com/photographiccollection/photo_exhibits/jacksonvillefire/|publisher=Florida Memory|accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Andrew's Episcopal Church (Jacksonville, Florida)|St. Andrew's Episcopal Church]], built of bricks in 1887, was the only major church in the city to withstand the fire. The [[Duval County Courthouse]] and all its real estate records were destroyed in the fire.  To this day real estate deeds in Duval County refer either to "the current public records of Duval County, Florida" or, if the records predate the fire, "the former public records of Duval County, Florida." It is the only county in Florida for which that is the case.{{cn|date=May 2018}} The only existing pre-Fire real estate records are title abstracts saved by Title and Trust, a title company that still charges for their use.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Reconstruction===
New York City architect [[Henry John Klutho]] helped rebuild the city. He and other architects, enamored by the "[[Prairie Style]]" of architecture then being popularized by architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] in Chicago and other Midwestern cities, designed exuberant local buildings with a Florida flair. Buildings designed by Klutho were [[Dyal-Upchurch Building]] (1902), [[Jacksonville_Public_Library#Carnegie_Library|Carnegie Library]] (1905), [[Laura_Street_Trio#Bisbee_Building|Bisbee Building]] (1909), [[Morocco Temple]] (1910), and the [[Florida Baptist Building]] (1924) While many of Klutho's buildings were demolished or abandoned by the 1980s, several of his creations remain including his most prominent work the [[St. James Building]]. The Jacksonville City Hall currently uses the St. James Building.&lt;ref name="DYAL"&gt;{{cite news | title=Dyal-Upchurch – then and now | last=Penland | first=Dolly | url=http://jacksonville.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2007/04/02/tidbits4.html | publisher=''[[Jacksonville Business Journal]]'' | date=March 30, 2007 | accessdate=2009-12-14|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JAH&gt;{{cite web | last=Wood | first=Wayne | url=http://www.jaxhistory.com/Jax%20Arch%20Herit/D-27.htm | title=Jacksonville's Architectural Heritage, Dyal-Upchurch Building | accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local charity [[Fresh Ministries]] recently{{when|date=January 2013}} restored the Klutho Apartments, in [[Springfield (Jacksonville)|Springfield]], and converted them into office space for the Community Development Corporation's Operation New Hope.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Jacksonville has one of the largest collections of Prairie Style buildings (particularly residences) outside the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2010-aug-a-jacksonville-landmark-prairie-school-architecture |title=A Jacksonville Landmark: Prairie School Architecture |last=Davis |first=Ennis |date=2010-08-04 |website=Metro Jacksonville |access-date=May 6, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend''' (born July 4, 1951) is an American attorney who was the sixth [[Lieutenant Governor of Maryland|Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Maryland]] from 1995 to 2003. She ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Maryland in [[Maryland gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]]. In 2010 Townsend became the chair of the non-profit American Bridge, an organization whose focus is to raise funds for Democratic candidates and causes.&lt;ref name="palin barbs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2010/12/kennedys_respon.html?rss_id=Top+Stories|title=Kennedys respond to Palin barbs|author= Michael J. Bailey |newspaper=The Boston Globe|date= December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a member of the prominent political [[Kennedy family]].

==Early life, education, and law career==
Townsend was born as Kathleen Hartington Kennedy in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], the eldest of [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Ethel Kennedy|Ethel Skakel]]'s 11 children, the eldest grandchild of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]] and [[Rose Kennedy]]. A baptismal certificate from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Greenwich shows that the godparents at the July 22, 1951 baptismal were Jean Kennedy and Daniel Walsh,{{citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=following citation only confirms Walsh was a priest}} a professor at Manhattanville College who later became a Catholic priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web |url=http://merton.org/Research/Correspondence/y1.aspx?id=2092 |title=Merton's Correspondence with: Walsh, Daniel, Fr. (1907–1975) |website=The Thomas Merton Center at Bellarmine University |access-date=August 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was named after her aunt, [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hostage to Fortune'' by Joseph P. Kennedy, edited by Amanda Smith&lt;/ref&gt; It was not assumed that the girls in the politically oriented Kennedy family would run for office or become public persons, while she was growing up.&lt;ref name="just like"/&gt; However, after her uncle President [[John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated, her father wrote her saying, "As the oldest of the next generation you have a particular responsibility. ... Be kind to others and work for your country." &lt;ref name="just like"/&gt; Her family gave her the nicknames "Clean Kathleen", "the Nun", and "the Un-Kennedy".&lt;ref name="just like"/&gt;

Over the summer of 1964, Kennedy won four blue ribbons for her "excellence in horsemanship".&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer380-381 /&gt;
On August 29, 1965, the fourteen-year-old Kennedy was somersaulted by her horse while competing at Sea Flash Farms in [[West Barnstable, Massachusetts]]. She was left unconscious and bleeding internally and was rushed to [[Cape Cod Hospital]], located fifteen miles away. Her family was en route to [[Hyannis Port]] at the time of the incident and was not located for another three hours.&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer380-381&gt;Oppenheimer, pp. 380–381.&lt;/ref&gt;
She was sixteen when her father was assassinated. The night he was shot at the Ambassador Hotel, Kennedy and her two eldest brothers, Joe and Robert, Jr., were being flown to [[Los Angeles]] aboard one of the jets in the Secret Service's presidential fleet named "the Jet Star".&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; She spent most of her childhood in [[McLean, Virginia]], and attended [[Stone Ridge School]] in nearby [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. She graduated from [[The Putney School]] in [[Vermont]]. She attended [[Radcliffe College]], receiving her [[bachelor's degree]] in history and literature in 1974. She then studied at the [[University of New Mexico School of Law]], receiving her [[Juris Doctor]] degree in 1978.

After graduation, she was admitted to and is a member of the Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maryland [[bar exam|bar associations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Kathleen Kennedy Townsend |access-date=July 14, 2017 |url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/08conoff/ltgov/former/html/msa12084.html |website=msa.maryland.gov |publisher=Maryand State Archives |date=October 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, she worked as an [[Lawyer|attorney]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], while her husband attended [[Yale Law School]]. She also worked on her uncle [[Ted Kennedy]]'s 1980 presidential campaign, stumped for local Democrats,&lt;ref name="just like"/&gt; and was a policy analyst for the [[Massachusetts]] governor's office in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aNshAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v58FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1391,7877010&amp;dq=kathleen+kennedy+townsend&amp;hl=en|title=The Privilege and the Pain of being a Kennedy|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|agency=Associated Press|author=Ann Blackman|date=November 13, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved to Maryland, her husband's home state, in 1984.&lt;ref name="just like"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/1999/07/26/kennedy.townsend.html|title=Kathleen Kennedy Townsend: Just like her father?|author= Sally B. Donnelly|date=July 26, 1999|work=CNN All Politics|publisher=''TIME''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Townsend became the first Kennedy to lose a [[General election#American usage|general election]] when she ran for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in Maryland's strongly Republican second congressional district, using the name Townsend only.&lt;ref name="just like"/&gt; Incumbent Republican [[Helen Delich Bentley]] defeated her 59% to 41%.

She then went to work for the state government of Maryland, holding numerous posts including assistant [[Attorney General]].

==Lieutenant Governor of Maryland==
In 1994, [[Parris Glendening]] was running for [[Governor of Maryland|Governor]] in a highly contested primary against then-Lt. Governor [[Melvin A. Steinberg]] when he selected her as his running mate. Experts did not believe she would be an asset, but her name recognition (she now used the name Kennedy Townsend) and her fund-raising skills, helped him to win.&lt;ref name="just like"/&gt;

[[File:Kathleen Kennedy Townsend giving out awards, 2001, cropped.jpg|180px|thumb|Townsend in 2001]]
In the general election, Glendening and Townsend beat Republican candidate [[Ellen Sauerbrey]] in one of Maryland's closest and most controversial gubernatorial elections. After unofficial results indicated that Sauerbrey had lost the election by a narrow margin, she began making what ''The Washington Post'' called "sensational charges" that the election had been stolen.&lt;ref name="for Sauerbrey"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/mdelect/statewide/sauerbrey1012.htm|title=For Sauerbrey, Past vs. Present|author=Donald P. Baker|date=October 12, 1998|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sauerbrey's allegations included ballot box stuffing, 100% voting in one precinct, voting by numerous dead people, and what she called the Kennedy "precedent"—that unproven rumors that John Kennedy had stolen the 1960 Presidential election proved that his niece Townsend had stolen this election.&lt;ref name="for Sauerbrey"/&gt;

The official vote tally declared Glendening the winner by 5,993 votes out of 1.4 million.&lt;ref name="for Sauerbrey"/&gt; Sauerbrey hired an election specialist known for aggressive tactics then filed a lawsuit alleging that 50,000 votes had been cast illegally.&lt;ref name="for Sauerbrey"/&gt; By the time the hearing began in January 1995, however, Sauerbrey had backed away from the fraud charges and her claim centered on sloppy election procedures and 3,600 challenged ballots.&lt;ref name="for Sauerbrey"/&gt; The number of challenged ballots would not have been enough to change the result even if all of them were thrown out. The judge ruled that about 1,800 votes had been cast in [[Baltimore]] by people whose names should have been purged from the rolls, but said that there was no clear and convincing evidence that fraud or procedural errors had affected the outcome.&lt;ref name="for Sauerbrey"/&gt; Sauerbrey dropped the suit three days before Glendening was to be inaugurated, but still maintained her belief that she had won the election.&lt;ref name="for Sauerbrey"/&gt;

Sauerbrey ran against Glendening again in 1998, but this time Glendening and Townsend won by a much wider margin (55% to 44%).

During her tenure as lieutenant governor, Townsend focused on reducing crime and promoting economic development.&lt;ref name="just like"/&gt;

==2002 gubernatorial election==
In the [[Maryland gubernatorial election, 2002|Maryland gubernatorial election of 2002]], Townsend faced off against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Robert Ehrlich]] and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[Spear Lancaster]].

During the campaign, Townsend was criticized for her choice of running mate, [[Admiral]] [[Charles R. Larson]], a novice politician who had switched parties only a few weeks before. Larson was also a white male, unlikely to help minority turnout.&lt;ref name="never shook off"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/topic/bal-te.md.defeat06nov06,0,5579696.story?page=2 |title=Townsend never shook off lightweight label: Drumbeat about lack of leadership qualities dogged her to the end|access-date=February 14, 2009 |last=Nitkin |first=David |date=November 6, 2002 |publisher=The Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich's running mate was [[Michael Steele]], an [[African-American]] lawyer who had been chairman of the Republican Party of Maryland.

Though Maryland traditionally votes Democratic and had not elected a Republican Governor in almost 40 years, Townsend lost the race, gaining 48% of the vote to Ehrlich's 51% and Lancaster's 1%. Ehrlich became only the seventh Republican governor in state history. The ''Baltimore Sun'' said the defeat derailed her political career, at least in the short run.&lt;ref name="never shook off"/&gt;

==Post political career==
Townsend, along with siblings [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.|Robert, Jr.]] and [[Kerry Kennedy|Kerry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/16/politics/main3623528.shtml|title=Kennedy Family Split On Endorsements|publisher=|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] for president in the 2008 Democratic primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-kennedy29jan29,0,1618955.story | title=Kennedys for Clinton | author=Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]] and [[Kerry Kennedy]] | work= [[Los Angeles Times]] | date=January 29, 2008 | access-date=January 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other family members (siblings [[Rory Kennedy|Rory]], [[Max Kennedy|Max]], mother [[Ethel Kennedy|Ethel]], cousins [[Caroline Kennedy|Caroline]] and [[Patrick J. Kennedy|Patrick]] and uncle [[Ted Kennedy|Ted]]) endorsed [[Barack Obama]] for the Democratic nomination. Once Obama won the nomination, however, Townsend and her siblings Robert, Jr. and Kerry supported him in the general election.

Since leaving office, Townsend has written the book, ''Failing America's Faithful: How Today's Churches Are Mixing God with Politics and Losing Their Way'', (Warner Books, 2007, {{ISBN|0-446-57715-4}}). Townsend also contributes to [http://therecoveringpolitician.com/category/contributors/kkt ''The Recovering Politician''] website started by Jonathan Miller.

She is an adjunct professor at the [[Georgetown Public Policy Institute]], a visiting fellow at the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at Harvard, and senior Nitze fellow at [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]].

In December 2010, she was appointed chair of American Bridge, a new non-profit that will raise funds for Democratic candidates and causes, and that is intended to be a Democratic counterpart to right-leaning organizations such as American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS.&lt;ref name="palin barbs"/&gt; She noted that the Democrats did not have such an organization during the 2010 election cycle, and that Republicans outspent the Democrats by $70 million. "I want to compete dollar to a dollar with the Republicans and I want to beat them", she said.&lt;ref name="hopes new"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2010/12/kathleen-kennedy-townsend-american-bridge-david-brock-2012-group.html|title=Kathleen Kennedy Townsend Hopes New Democratic Fundraising Group Will Avert Another ‘Disaster’ In 2012|date=December 2, 2010|author=Michael Falcone|work=The Note|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kommersant''''' ({{lang-ru|Коммерса́нтъ}}, {{IPA-ru|kəmʲɪrˈsant|IPA}}, ''The Businessman'', often shortened to '''[[Ъ]]''') is a nationally distributed daily newspaper published in [[Russia]] mostly devoted to politics and business. It is a leading liberal business broadsheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The press in Russia|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4315129.stm|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=16 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TNS Media and NRS Russia certified July 2013 circulation of the daily was 120,000-130,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kommersant.ru/about/kommersant|title=Kommersant Website; (Russian)|year=2013|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The newspaper was initially published in 1909, and it was closed down following the [[Bolshevik]] seizure of power and the introduction of censorship in 1917.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In 1989, with the onset of press freedom in Russia, ''Kommersant'' was re-established under the ownership of businessman and publicist [[Vladimir Yakovlev (journalist)|Vladimir Yakovlev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/source-profile/356511-kommersant|title=Kommersant; Presseurop (English)|work=Presseurop|year=2012|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the point that the publication had outlasted the Soviet regime, "Kommersant" is spelled in Russian with a terminal [[Yer|hard sign]] (ъ) &amp;ndash; a letter that is silent at the end of a word in modern Russian, and was thus largely abolished by the post-revolution [[Reforms of Russian orthography#The post-revolution reform|Russian spelling reform]]. This is played up in the Kommersant logo, which features a script hard sign at the end of somewhat more formal font. The newspaper also refers to itself or its redaction as “Ъ”.

In 1997, autos-to-Aeroflot mogul [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] &amp;ndash; a member of the former President Boris Yeltsin's 'family'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,,2056443,00.html/ ''Fortune made in Yeltsin era''] &amp;ndash; ''Guardian'', 13 April 2007. Retrieved 24 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; bought the Kommersant publishing house, which included ''Kommersant-daily'', two serious weekly magazines (the political ''Kommersant-vlast'' (literally 'Power') and the financial ''[[Kommersant Dengi]]'' ('Money') &amp;ndash; as well as entertainment magazines ''Domovoi'' and ''Avtopilot'' and ''Molotok'', a teen magazine, which later incurred the authorities' wrath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/russia/kremlin/82774-1/ ''Prosecutors to save Russian teenagers from SMS pornography'' &amp;ndash; ''Pravda'', 30 June 2006]. Retrieved 24 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berezovsky sacked ''Kommersant'''s director-general, Andrei Vassiliev, and editor-in-chief, Alexander Stukalin, on 14 July 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/iscip/digest/vol10/ed1008.html Boston University publication, July 2005]. Retrieved 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in a move widely seen as preparation for the 2008 [[Russian presidential election, 2008|Russian presidential elections]].

In January 2005, ''Kommersant'' published blank pages as a protest at a court ruling ordering it to publish a denial of a story about a crisis at [[Alfa-Bank]]. The sole article in the paper was this one, published upside down, on the front page. The headline of the article was "Full Plaintiff" (полный истец) which has little meaning, but rhymes with a [[Russian mat|Russian swear word]], meaning "complete disaster" ({{Lang-ru|[[Russian mat|полный пиздец]]|links=|translit=polniy pizdets}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Полный истец|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=543041|work=Kommersant| location=Moscow|date=31 January 2005|language= Russian|accessdate=24 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English version of the article was headed "Alfa-d Up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alfa-d Up|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p543041/r_524/Alfa-d_Up/|work=Kommersant|location=Moscow|date=31 January 2005|accessdate=28 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606111951/http://www.kommersant.com/p543041/r_524/Alfa-d_Up/|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berezovsky sold the Kommersant publishing house to an old friend and business partner, Georgian fruit canner and opposition television station owner [[Badri Patarkatsishvili]], who was already chairman of the Kommersant company's board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorsweblog.org/print_newspapers/2006/02/russian_publishing_house_kommersant_gets.php/ ''Russian publishing house Kommersant gets a new owner'' &amp;ndash; Editors Weblog, World Association of Newspapers, 28 February 2006 quoting ''Ekspert'' magazine]. Retrieved 24 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, Patarkatsishvili sold his 100% stake in the Kommersant publishing house to [[Alisher Usmanov]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/10/GIPI.html/ ''Alisher Usmanov'', ''Forbes''] Retrieved 24 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; head of Gazprom's Gazprominvestholding subsidiary.

After clashing with Usmanov, ''Kommersant'' editor-in-chief Vladislav Borodulin left the paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorsweblog.org/newsrooms_and_journalism/2006/10/russia_kommersant_editor_quits.php ''Kommersant editor quits'' - World Association of Newspapers, quoting the Associated Press, 2 October 2006]. Retrieved 24 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; "[Borodulin’s] decision to resign was not forced, but evidently they expressed different views on how the publishing house should be developed," said the group's commercial director. Andrei Vasilyev, appointed for a second stint at the helm of the daily &amp;ndash; after a long run from 1999 to 2005&amp;ndash; said ''Kommersant-daily'' had no intention of following any imposed policy, and added that the edition would carry articles that might not please the owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20061002/54450883.html ''New/old Kommersant editor vows to maintain line''- RIA Novosti, 2 October 2006]. Retrieved 24 July  2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 2008 the publication of articles in English ceased, and currently the Kommersant website has no English version. Since February 2009 ''Kommersant'' newspaper is printed and distributed in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.uk.com |title="Коммерсантъ" United Kingdom|work=Kommersant|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the paper began hosting US-Russia Crosstalk, a joint initiative between ''Kommersant'' and the [[Valdai Discussion Club|Valdai Club]] in Russia, and ''[[The Washington Times]]'' and the [[Center for the National Interest]] in the United States, featuring foreign policy related discussion regarding relations between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/us-russia-crosstalk/|title=U.S.-Russia Crosstalk - Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|website=www.washingtontimes.com|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court cases==
In January 2000 ''Kommersant'' was found guilty of libel against Russian entrepreneur [[Alex Konanykhin]] and ordered to pay compensation of US$3,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://themoscowtimes.com/news/article/us-court-finds-kommersant-guilty-of-libel/267610.html|title= U.S. Court Finds Kommersant Guilty of Libel|work= The Moscow Times|date= 25 January 2000|accessdate= 13 January 2011|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120418214924/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/us-court-finds-kommersant-guilty-of-libel/267610.html|archivedate= 18 April 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009 a Russian MP and prominent businessman [[Oleg Mikheyev]] sued the ''Kommersant'' for $217 million, claiming that one of the newspaper's articles "spoiled of his bank so badly it had to be sold at disadvantageous price". The court dismissed the judicial proceeding due to jurisdictional issues.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="79917">This is a '''list of companies founded by [[University of California, Berkeley]] alumni''', including attendees who enrolled in degree-programs at Berkeley but did not eventually graduate. This list is not exhaustive, as it only includes notable [[Company|companies]] &lt;!-- i.e. having articles on Wikipedia, but we don't reference Wikipedia within Wikipedia--&gt; of which the founding and development history is well recorded by reliable sources. In particular, [[Subsidiary|subsidiaries]] are listed with their owners in parentheses.

UC Berkeley has often been cited as one of the leading universities worldwide in producing entrepreneurs and attracting funding for [[Startup company|start-up companies]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/story_jump/in-startup-sweepstakes-its-cal-vs-stanford/|title=In startup sweepstakes, it’s Cal vs. Stanford|date=2016-09-09|work=Berkeley News|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.graphicsprings.com/founders-funding-and-exit-ranking-usa|title=Founders Funding And Exit Ranking Usa {{!}} GraphicSprings|work=Founders Funding And Exit Ranking Usa {{!}} GraphicSprings|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2013/08/18/uc-berkeley-third-largest-producer-of-entrepreneurs-report-says/|title=UC Berkeley third-largest producer of entrepreneurs, report says {{!}} The Daily Californian|date=2013-08-18|work=The Daily Californian|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-berkeley-no-1-global-entrepreneurship|title=UC Berkeley is No. 1 in global entrepreneurship|date=2016-09-16|work=University of California|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbinsights.com/research/university-entrepreneurship-report/|title=The University Entrepreneurship Report – Alumni of Top Universities Rake in $12.6 Billion Across 559 Deals|date=2012-10-29|work=CB Insights Research|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://readwrite.com/2012/12/03/one-university-to-rule-them-all-stanford-tops-startup-list/|title=One University To Rule Them All: Stanford Tops Startup List – ReadWrite|date=2012-12-03|work=ReadWrite|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its alumni and faculty have founded a large number of companies, and its degrees are among the most valuable in [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://executive.berkeley.edu/thought-leadership/press-release/entrepreneurs-and-startups-uc-berkeley|title=Entrepreneurs and Startups at UC Berkeley {{!}} executive.berkeley.edu|website=executive.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/excellence/innovation-and-entrepreneurship|title=Innovation and Entrepreneurship {{!}} Research UC Berkeley|website=vcresearch.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/12/09/silicon-valleys-top-10-most-lucrative.html|title=Silicon Valley's top 10 most lucrative degrees: where to go and what to major in to get the most money|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bizjournals.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Industry/Startups/startup.html|title=EECS Entrepreneurial Startups {{!}} EECS at UC Berkeley|website=www2.eecs.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[PitchBook Data|PitchBook]], from 2006 to 2017, Berkeley produced 1,089 company founders as alumni or current students, second only to [[Stanford University]] in the world; and these founders created 961 companies, more than any other university in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_Universities_Report_2017-2018_Edition.pdf|title=Universities Report: The top 50 universities producing VC-backed entrepreneurs (2017–2018)|last=|first=|date=|website=Pitchbook|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.pitchbook.com/pdf/PitchBook_Universities_Report_2016-2017_Edition.pdf|title=Universities Report: Top 50 universities producing VC-backed entrepreneurs (2016–2017)|last=|first=|date=|website=Pitchbook|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this list, founders of a company which [[merged]] with other companies to form a new company are counted as founders of the new company. However, founders of a company which later dissolved into several successor companies are ''not'' counted as founders of those successor companies; this same rule applies to [[Spin-off (corporate)|spin-off companies]]. Finally, a defunct company is a company that had stopped functioning completely (e.g., [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]]) without dissolving, merging or being [[Acquisitions|acquired]].

The film was released by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] through [[TriStar Pictures]] on May 13, 2016, received  mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $93 million.&lt;ref name="Mojo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/money-monster |title=Money Monster reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Per WP:LEAD, the lead must summarize all parts of the article.

==Plot==
Flamboyant television financial expert Lee Gates is in the midst of the latest edition of his show, ''Money Monster''. Less than 24 hours earlier, IBIS Clear Capital's stock inexplicably cratered, apparently due to a glitch in a trading algorithm, costing investors $800 million. Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby appear for an interview about the crash, but Camby unexpectedly left for a business trip to Geneva.

Midway through the show, a deliveryman wanders onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Lee hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. He is Kyle Budwell, who invested $60,000—his entire life savings—in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company on the show. Kyle was wiped out along with the other investors. Unless he gets some answers, he will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver—and with it, Kyle's leverage—is to shoot Lee and hope he survives.

With the help of longtime director Patty Fenn, Lee tries to calm Kyle and find Camby for him, though Kyle is not satisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He also is not satisfied by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied by her own explanation, either, and defies colleagues to contact a programmer who created the algorithm, Won Joon. Reached in Seoul, Joon insists that an algorithm could not take such a large, lopsided position unless someone meddled with it.

Lee appeals to his TV viewers for help, seeking to recoup the lost investment, but is dejected by their response. New York City police find Kyle's pregnant girlfriend Molly and allow her to talk to Kyle through a video feed. When she learns that he lost everything, she viciously berates him before the police cut the feed. Lee, seemingly taking pity on Kyle, agrees to help his captor discover what went wrong.

Once Camby finally returns, Diane flips through his passport, discovering that he did not go to Geneva but to Johannesburg.  With this clue, along with messages from Camby's phone, Patty and the ''Money Monster'' team contact a group of Icelandic [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] to seek the truth. After a police sniper takes a shot at Lee and misses, he and Kyle resolve to corner Camby at [[Federal Hall National Memorial]], where Camby is headed according to Diane. They head out with one of the network's cameramen, Lenny, plus the police and a mob of fans and jeerers alike. Kyle accidentally shoots and wounds producer Ron Sprecher when Ron throws Lee a new earpiece. Kyle and Lee finally confront Camby with video evidence obtained by the hackers.

It turns out that Camby bribed a South African miners' union, planning to have IBIS make an $800 million investment in a platinum mine while the union was on strike. The strike lowered the mine's owners stock, allowing Camby to buy it at a low price. If Camby's plan had succeeded, IBIS would have generated a multibillion-dollar profit when work resumed at the mine and the stock of the mine's owner rose again. The gambit backfired when the union stayed on the picket line. Camby attempted to bribe the union leader, Moshe Mambo, in order to stop the strike, but Mambo refused and continued the strike, causing IBIS' stock to sink under the weight of its position in the flailing company.

Despite the evidence, Camby refuses to admit his swindle until Kyle takes the explosive vest off Lee and puts it on him. Camby admits to his wrongdoing to Kyle on live camera. Satisfied with the outcome, Kyle throws the detonator away, then much to Lee's dismay gets fatally shot by the police. In the aftermath, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] announces that IBIS will be put under investigation, while Camby is charged with violations of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].

===Critical response===
{{Anchor|Critics}}
''Money Monster'' met with mixed reviews from critics. As of April 2018, the film holds a 57% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 255 reviews with the consensus stating: "''Money Monster''{{'}}s strong cast and solidly written story ride a timely wave of socioeconomic anger that's powerful enough to overcome an occasionally muddled approach to its worthy themes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Money Monster (2016)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/money_monster/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Metacritic the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Money Monster Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/money-monster|website=Metacritic|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while [[comScore]] reported audiences gave an 81% overall positive score and a 56% definite recommend.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

Clooney's performance was praised by critics. A.O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that the "quality of the acting both enhances the credibility of the narrative and exposes some of its weak points".&lt;ref name="NYTReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=A.O.|title=Review: In ‘Money Monster,’ a Broke Investor Holds a Grudge and a Gun|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/movies/review-in-money-monster-review-george-clooney-julia-roberts-jodie-foster.html|accessdate=April 14, 2018|work=The New York Times|date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christy Lemire of [[RogerEbert.com]], in a mixed review, praised Clooney's "enormous charisma", but criticised that the film "never ends up being quite as thrilling or thought-provoking as [its] premise sounds".&lt;ref name="RogerEbertReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lemire|first1=Christy|title=Money Monster Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2016)|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/money-monster-2016|accessdate=April 14, 2018|work=RogerEbert.com|date=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Hewitt of ''[[Empire]]'' also praised the film.&lt;ref name="EmpireReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hewitt|first1=Chris|title=Money Monster Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/money-monster/review/|accessdate=April 14, 2018|work=Empire|date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reviewers praised the atmosphere of suspense. Sandra Hall of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' praised the film, particularly Foster's directing and her ability to "keep things moving".&lt;ref name="SMHReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Sandra|title=Money Monster review: explosive thriller takes aim at Wall Street trickery|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/money-monster-review-explosive-thriller-takes-aim-at-wall-street-trickery-20160530-gp7fp7.html|accessdate=April 14, 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Brody of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that Foster "keeps the action vigorous and the suspense high", but said that the film was "swallowed up by the very hectoring and impersonal sensationalism that it derides".&lt;ref name="NewYorkerReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brody|first1=Richard|title=Jodie Foster’s Boring and Exciting "Money Monster"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/jodie-fosters-boring-and-exciting-money-monster|accessdate=April 14, 2018|work=The New Yorker|date=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviewers criticised the script. Wendy Ide of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film a negative review, writing that the film lacks the "authentic anger" of ''[[The Big Short]]'' and the "sniper-like accuracy" of ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]'', and criticising Clooney's "complete lack of sincerity".&lt;ref name="GuardianReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ide|first1=Wendy|title=Money Monster review – a shouty blend of The Big Short and Network|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/29/money-monster-review-jodie-foster-george-clooney|accessdate=April 14, 2018|work=The Guardian|date=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Travers of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said that what the script lacks in "emotional subtext" can be found in the cast's "richly detailed" performances.&lt;ref name="RollingStoneReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Travers|first1=Peter|title='Money Monster' Movie Review|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/money-monster-20160512|accessdate=April 14, 2018|work=Rolling Stone|date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a mixed review, Robbie Collin of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' called the film a "raucous hostage thriller that eschews explanation for wish-fulfillment", concluding by saying that "in the heat of the moment, ''Money Monster''{{’}}s bluster and nerve keeps you hooked".&lt;ref name="TelegraphReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collin|first1=Robbie|title=Didn't understand The Big Short?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4747">'''OHADA''' is a system of [[corporate law]] and implementing institutions adopted by seventeen [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]]n nations in 1993 in [[Port Louis]], [[Mauritius]]. OHADA is the acronym for the French "''Organisation pour l'harmonisation en Afrique du droit des affaires''", which translates into English as "Organisation for the Harmonization of Corporate Law in Africa".

The OHADA Treaty is made up today of 17 African states. Initially fourteen African countries signed the treaty, with two countries ([[Comoros]] and [[Guinea]]) subsequently adhering to the treaty and a third (the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) due to adhere shortly.{{When|date=November 2017}} The Treaty is open to all states, whether or not they are members of the [[Organisation of African Unity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.int/en/ Organization of African Unity]&lt;/ref&gt;  OHADA was created with the objective of fostering economic development in West and Central Africa by creating a better investment climate so as to attract investment in a 225 million-consumer market.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Characteristics==
As a West and Central African initiative to harmonize business laws and implementing institutions, OHADA aims to find alternative solutions to the lack of economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa - a region which has challenged and puzzled [[economic development|development economists]] for several decades. The stated purpose of the initiative is to facilitate and encourage both domestic and foreign investment in the member states, and as most of the participating countries are former [[French colonies]], they draw chiefly on a modernised French legal model to achieve their goals. The laws promulgated by OHADA are exclusively business-related. The OHADA treaty has created a supranational court ([[Common Court of Justice and Arbitration of the Organization for the Harmonization in Africa of Business Law]] [http://www.ohada.org/index.php/en/court-of-justice-and-arbitration/ccja-at-a-glance]) to ensure uniformity and consistent legal interpretations across the member countries, and the French influence in court proceedings is apparent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3073&amp;context=expresso Dickerson, Claire M.: "Harmonizing Business Laws in Africa: OHADA Calls the Tune"] 44:1 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law (2005), 63 pages, retrieved 18 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The most critical tool for legal integration is the Uniform Act. A uniform act is the recollection of all relevant legal norms needed to ease business in the Member States. As of today,{{when|date=May 2016}} OHADA includes nine validated Uniform Acts: General Commercial Law, Commercial Companies and Economic Interest Groups, Secured Transactions Law, Debt Resolution Law, Insolvency Law, Arbitration Law, Harmonization of Corporate Accounting, Contracts for the Carriage of Goods, Cooperatives Companies Law. Two Uniform Acts (Arbitration and Accounting) are currently being revised.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9768">'''Peer-to-peer asset management''' is the practice of sharing [[investment strategies]] between unrelated individuals, or "peers", without going through a traditional [[financial intermediary]] such as a bank or other collective investment management vehicle.

==Overview==
The rationale for P2P asset management is financial disintermediation. When multiple intermediaries participate in an investment management transaction, there is the potential for a conflict of interest between providers and buyers of the service, in a well documented sequence described in economic theory as the [[principal–agent problem]]. Intermediaries seek [[profit maximization]]. In the context of investment management, they offer the most attractive risk/return propositions to larger, more sophisticated customers. This maximizes their commission revenue for a given distribution effort. Further, given the option between two comparable investment opportunities, an intermediary enticed by investment management kickbacks will recommend the option most lucrative to him, perhaps at the expense of the best interests of non-sophisticated investors.

This regime is under regulatory and competitive pressure because it privileges large, sophisticated investors at the cost of the choice available to the relatively worse-off, and because incentives are against the most vulnerable element of the chain. The FCA (UK), have implemented the "treating customers fairly" policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/being-regulated/meeting-your-obligations/fair-treatment-of-customers | title=Treating customers fairly | date=2013-03-29 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405050340/https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/being-regulated/meeting-your-obligations/fair-treatment-of-customers | archivedate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with wide-ranging reforms such as the Retail Distribution Review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/being-regulated/meeting-your-obligations/firm-guides/guide-financial-advisers/rdr-adviser-charging | title=Retail Distribution Review - Adviser Charging | date=2013-06-21 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712074151/http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/being-regulated/meeting-your-obligations/firm-guides/guide-financial-advisers/rdr-adviser-charging | archivedate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; gradually banning "kickbacks" whereby providers of investment management services reward "independent" advisers who place their products.

Rather than the symptom – kickbacks and inadequate advice – new competitors tackle the issue – multiple intermediaries – by disrupting the intermediation chain. Propositions like [[Wealthfront]] (US) and [[Nutmeg (company)|Nutmeg]] (UK) leverage the reach of the Internet to pair a central provider of investment management services with end-customers online.

P2P asset management takes dis-intermediation full circle. Rather than a central provider directing investors choices, an information exchange takes place between all investors, whereby the best performing strategies by all are made available to all. The first completely P2P provider is [[Darwinex]] (UK). Darwinex describe themselves as an exchange pairing providers with buyers of investment strategies, without intermediaries. Buyers pay providers with a share in their investment profits, with [[Darwinex]] acting as a central counter-party that independently lists the strategies for a public quoted price based off the underlying assets, rates strategy quality and manages investor risk.

P2P asset management offers the potential benefit vs. centralized providers that all participants crowdsource strategies that are independently rated in a competitive set-up.

==Characteristics==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
While peer-to-peer asset management shares some of the characteristics of traditional investment management services, owing to its innovative nature it is sometimes referred to as an [[alternative financial service]].

The key characteristics of peer-to-peer asset management are:

* it is conducted for profit;
* it is open to all, without minimum investment volumes
* no necessary common bond or prior relationship between strategy providers and investors;
* intermediation by a peer-to-peer asset manager or strategy exchange;
* transactions take place on-line;
* Investors pick their chosen strategies without 3rd party advice;

Early peer-to-peer asset management was also characterized by disintermediation and reliance on social networks but features like "Social Trading" have started to fade. Since "Social Trading" disclosed live trades, investors learnt to replicate the strategies without compensation to the best providers, who then refused to publish them.

Popular providers of P2P asset management services such as [[Darwinex]] provide the following services:
* Brokerage and execution services for strategy providers to route their strategies to the market
* Rating services benchmarking strategies for desirable attributes like experience, risk management, discipline, timing, performance and scalability
* Risk management services shielding investors from unexpected deviations from target risk by the strategy providers
* Custody services – in segregated accounts with low risk counterparties
* Verifying investor identity, employment and income under customer protection legislation such as [[MiFID]] in Europe 
* Processing payments from investors and carrying out the [[delivery versus payment]] payment to the providers agreeing to their strategy being replicated
* Regulatory cover (asset management is a regulated activity that only authorized persons may legally carry out) and legal compliance and reporting
* Attracting new providers and investors (marketing)

==History==
{{original research|section|date=June 2017}}
P2P asset management is a recent industry. Growth by venture backed companies like [[Currensee]] or [[Covestor]] failed to satisfy their backers, and without additional funding, some were bought (Currensee).

Some customers{{who|date=June 2017}} argued that failure to independently manage the risk of the strategies or to protect the intellectual property of the providers breached the confidence chain required between strategy providers and investors.

==Legal regulation==
P2P asset managers broadly require two sets of regulatory permission. The first is to carry out brokerage services on behalf of traders and investors. The second is to manage investment strategies on behalf of retail or professional investors.

In the UK, these two permissions are the local implementation of [[MiFID]] regulation, referred to as "Dealing in investments as agent"&lt;ref name="fshandbook.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fshandbook.info/FS/glossary-html/handbook/Glossary/D?definition=G264|title=Home - FCA Handbook|website=fshandbook.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; for brokerage services, and "Dealing in investments as principal"&lt;ref name="fshandbook.info"/&gt; and "Managing Investments"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fshandbook.info/FS/glossary-html/handbook/Glossary/M?definition=G683|title=Home - FCA Handbook|website=fshandbook.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the asset management side of the proposition. Further, permission is required for "Arranging safeguarding and administration of assets",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fshandbook.info/FS/glossary-html/handbook/Glossary/A?definition=G72|title=Home - FCA Handbook|website=fshandbook.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; which grants investors protection under the FCA Client Money Rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fshandbook.info/FS/html/FCA/CASS/7|title=FCA Handbook - FCA Handbook|website=fshandbook.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important nuance is that P2P asset managers could suffer a conflict of interest, if in addition to acting in an agent capacity, providing investment management and brokerage services, they entered deals for their own account, acting as principals. This would stack their principal interests against the customers it served as agent. Traditional providers of financial services potentially suffering this conflict claim to overcome it by enforcing a [[Chinese wall]].

P2P managers like [[Darwinex]], tackle the issue at source by acting exclusively in an agent capacity. Customers may verify this restriction by ensuring that P2P managers hold the "matched principal restriction",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/register/firmPermConditionDetails.do?permConditionSid=321789&amp;reqlim=Limitation&amp;activitySid=0&amp;firmSid=0|title=Financial Conduct Authority|website=www.fsa.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby the regulator bans their engaging in any activity as a principal. A further test to identify conflicts of interest is to verify that execution services are provided at arms' length through 3rd parties (ideally recognized exchanges), at public prices.

==Advantages and criticism==
The main advantage of P2P asset management is the lack of intermediaries, which results in two structural advantages.

The first is that all incentives are aligned. The strategy provider can be certain that the strategy is not disclosed by the exchange because this would drop its prize to zero and hurt the exchange. The investor can be certain that the exchange will do its best to rate the strategies accurately, since it is the only way to ensure long term volumes.

The second advantage is that any profits achieved by the strategies are only shared between the strategy provider, the buyer, and the exchange. There is a single intermediary, without which the profit exchange is not possible, but no more.

Some have criticised P2P asset managers for the lack of "professional" asset management expertise by the strategy providers.

'''Park Central Hotel San Francisco''' is a 36 story [[highrise]] [[hotel]] at 50 Third Street in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. The hotel has 23,000 square feet of meeting and event space, including a 9,000 square-foot ballroom with capacity of up to 1,200 guests. MaSo, the hotel's restaurant, can host private events for up to 300 guests and has an outdoor terrace.&lt;ref name=sfbt /&gt;

It was the first private project of the City of San Francisco Redevelopment Agency's development in the Yerba Buena district&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdengineers.com/services/structures/residential/index.php?services=1&lt;/ref&gt; and opened in 1984&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leftbank.com/contact_joelguillon&lt;/ref&gt; as the '''[[Le Méridien|Hotel Meridien San Francisco]]'''. It was later known as the '''ANA Hotel San Francisco''', then '''The Argent Hotel'''. Following its sale in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/29-million-makeover-for-Argent-The-hotel-will-2651228.php&lt;/ref&gt; the hotel was renamed again and was known from April 12, 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2007_2nd/Apr07_Argent.html&lt;/ref&gt; to January 23, 2015 as '''The Westin Market Street San Francisco''' when it underwent a $28.3 million renovation. LaSalle Hotel Properties acquired the property for $350 million and renamed it Park Central San Francisco.&lt;ref name=sfbt&gt;{{cite news|title=LaSalle Hotel Properties grabs The Westin Market Street hotel in S.F. for $350 million|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2015/01/lasalle-buys-westin-market-street-hotel-sf-moscone.html?ana=e_sfbt_bn_breakingnews&amp;u=ry6EmrTvOuTa8AYIbdKZk6jfBX&amp;t=1422319981|accessdate=27 January 2015|publisher=San Francisco Business Times|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pete Power''' (born 1969) is the CEO of [[Angkor Mikroheranhvatho Kampuchea|Angkor Mikroheranhvatho (Kampuchea) Co.]] (AMK), the largest [[microfinance]] institution in [[Cambodia]] in terms of borrower numbers.&lt;ref&gt;AMK Cambodia. http://www.amkcambodia.com/?page=detail&amp;menu1=4&amp;article=4&amp;lg=en&lt;/ref&gt;  AMK currently provides credit to about 300,000 customers or 10% of the households in Cambodia. Power successfully led AMK and its 1,000 staff through the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|global economic downturn]] and subsequently embarked on a strategic transformation process to change AMK from a rural credit-only organization to a provider of a broad range of financial services, including [[saving]]s, [[microcredit|credit]], money transfers, [[mobile banking]], and various other innovative financial services.&lt;ref&gt;Artese, Valerie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12439">{{Canadian politics}}
The '''Public Service Commission of Canada''' ('''PSC'''; {{lang-fr|Commission de la fonction publique du Canada}}) is an independent government agency that safeguards merit-based hiring, non-partisanship, representativeness of Canada's diversity and the use of both official languages (English and French) in the Canadian public service. The PSC aims to protect the integrity of hiring and promotion within the public service. As well, the Commission works to protect the political impartiality and non-partisanship of public servants. The Commission develops staffing policies and provides guidance to public service managers and recruits Canadians into the public service. To ensure the staffing system in the government is properly maintained, the PSC has the authority to audit and investigate to ensure departments and managers make improvements. While typical government departments are headed by Ministers, the PSC is an independent agency that is headed by a President (currently Patrick Borbey) who reports to the Canadian Parliament.

==Mandate and goals==
The PSC has the mandate to appoint people to the public service, and to promote people within the government which can in turn be delegated to deputy heads (often referred to as Deputy Ministers in Canada).  The PSC can also assist government departments with recruitment and assessment services.
The PSC oversees the integrity of the hiring and promotion system, and makes sure that the hiring process is not compromised by partisan interference from elected officials. Part of this overseeing role involves collecting and analyzing data on hiring and promotion in the public service (e.g., hiring of different groups, by region, by department). As well, the PSC performs audits across the staffing system, examining  hiring and promotion files, to ensure that employees are hired and promoted based on merit. Lastly, the PSC administers the Part VII of ''Public Service Employment Act'' that recognizes the rights of public service employees to engage in political activities while maintaining the principle of political impartiallity in the public service.
  
The mission of the PSC is to achieve "A highly competent, non-partisan and representative Public Service, able to provide services in both official languages and in which employment practices are characterized by fairness, access, representativeness and transparency

==Program Activities==
The PSC has set out four program activities that are done to reach its strategic outcome:

*The Appointment Integrity and Political Neutrality activity (policies and standards on safeguarding the integrity of hiring and promotion and political neutrality issues)
*The Oversight of Integrity of Staffing and Political Neutrality (makes sure that the integrity of public service hiring and promotion is protected and safeguards the political neutrality of public servants)
*The Staffing Services and Assessment activity (provides managers with tools to help them assess and select employment applicants).
*The Internal Services program activity (corporate management and planning frameworks for the Management Accountability Framework, finance, internal staff, information technology, communications, and other administrative and general support).

==Public Service Employment Act==
The 2003 ''Public Service Employment Act'' (which came into force on December 31, 2005) emphasizes the values of merit, non-partisanship, fairness, access, transparency and representativeness.

Merit refers to the use of essential qualifications during the hiring and promotion process. This means that people who are hired and promoted in the public service must possess certain competencies, skills, and experience (merit), rather than based on political connections or partisan affiliations (political patronage). The merit principle requires that every person who is appointed to the public service has met the essential qualifications and requirements established for the position. The essential requirements can include official language proficiency, asset qualifications, operational requirements (e.g., availability to do shift work or work on weekends), and organizational needs (e.g., need to increase the hiring of women) that have been identified by the head of a department or agency.

Non-partisanship means that appointments of people to the public service (and promotions of public servants )have to be made without political influence from Ministers or partisan officials. Although Canadian public servants were disallowed any involvement in political activities in their private time throughout much of the 20th century, in 1967, legislative changes allowed public servants to request permission to take leave without pay to run in an election. In 1991, a Supreme Court decision gave public servants the right to engage in political activities. The 2003 Public Service Employment Act clarified what political activities public servants are allowed to engage in.

Public servants can engage in political activities such as supporting a candidate in an election or taking leave without pay to run in an election, but they have to maintain their political impartiality as public servants. In order to comply with the non-partisanship values in the Act, public servants must only do the types of political activities that do not conflict or impair their ability to fulfill their responsibilities in a politically impartial manner. The type and degree of political activities that a public servant can engage in depends on several factors, such as the visibility of the political activities that the public servant wants to engage in and the visibility of the public servant in their job in the public service.

==Historical timeline==
* Before [[responsible government]], Canada had no real civil service; government officials were appointed by either [[the Crown]] or its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] representatives. These officials usually served for an unspecified period ("during the pleasure of the Crown") for as long as they were deemed fit for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/Civilservice-CanadianHistory.htm|title=Civil Service in Canada|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Marionopolis College}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1849 - when responsible government began in 1849, there was a recognition that the roles of the political and non-political government officials needed to be defined and distinguished from one another.
* 1868 - the ''Canada Civil Service Act'' was enacted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/research/timeline/psc_timeline_e.htm|title=A Timeline of the Public Service Commission of Canada|accessdate=2007-07-23|publisher=Public Service Commission of Canada |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703131234/http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/research/timeline/psc_timeline_e.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The "Civil Service Act" of 1882 created a process for examining candidates for the civil service, with a Board of Civil Service Examiners
* 1908 - the ''Civil Service Amendment Act'' created the Civil Service Commission, an independent body to oversee appointments to government positions in Ottawa (this was called the "inside service", in contrast to the public service outside the capital).
* The ''[[Civil Service Act 1918]]'' set in place merit-based appointments and reinforced the independence of the Commission. It also brought the "outside service" (the public service outside of Ottawa) under the domain of the Commission, along with greater oversight with regards to appointments and promotions for members of the "inside service".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair Roberts (academic)|Roberts, Alasdair]]. ''So-Called Experts: How American Consultants Remade the Canadian Civil Service, 1918-1921''.  Institute of Public Administration of Canada, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1920s - the Commission developed its competitive system of examinations for appointment and [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]] (a merit system) as a viable alternative to the [[patronage]] system.
* 1921 - formal restrictions were placed against the employment of married women. Women already holding permanent positions who married had to resign. These restrictions were not removed until 1955.
* 1924 - The Civil Service Superannuation Act was intended to promote and protect a career civil service.
* 1932 - staff control regulations are established and Treasury Board is given authority over the Civil Service Commission's staffing responsibilities.
* 1949 - the number of [[World War II]] veterans assigned to positions in the civil service under the statutory veterans preference rises to 55,000.
* 1951 - The Financial Administration Act of 1951 provided final authority to the Treasury Board for management (administration and organization) of the public service.
* 1957 - The CSC establishes the Pay Research Bureau to provide objective information on rates of pay and conditions of employment in government and industry, and to recommend salary rates for civil servants.
* 1961 - The new Civil Service Act of 1961 gave civil servants the right of appeal against not only promotions, but also transfers, demotions, suspensions and dismissals.
* 1962 - The Government adopted recommendations by the [[Royal Commission on Government Organization]] (Glassco Commission) on the management of the Public Service, including delegating authority to departments to manage their own personnel and to be held accountable for efficient performance.
* 1966 - [[Multilingualism|Bilingualism]] becomes an element of merit in the national capital area.
* 1967 - Public Service Employment Act (PSEA) and Public Service Staff Relations Act (PSSRA) come into effect. The PSEA gave the renamed Public Service Commission the responsibility for all the elements of the staffing process. The PSSRA created a [[collective bargaining]] regime in the civil service.
* early 1970s - rapid expansion of the public service.
* Late 1970s - significant reduction of public service.
* 1979 - The Bilingualism Bonus was introduced for public servants who met the bilingual language requirements of their positions.
* 1984 - the Commission on Equality in Employment issued its report, which recommended that targets and not quotas are the most effective means of achieving equity in the employment of members of under-represented groups.
* 1986 - further employment layoff programs again reduce the public service.
* 1992 - Public Service Reform Act amends both the PSEA and the Public Service Staff Relations Act. This provides more flexibility for managers to respond quickly to changing operational needs or to allow employees to acquire new skills. The Act also enabled the PSC to prescribe standards of competence to measure merit.
* 1995 - a restraint-focused federal budget leads to further reductions in the size of the civil service.
* Late 1990s and early 2000s - rapid growth of the public service
* 2003 - a new Public Service Employment Act, which created the first legislative definition of merit (it also redefined merit)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7918">[[File:Camara municipal Povoa Varzim bandeiras.JPG|230px|right|thumb|City Hall, in Almada Square, dressed with Póvoa de Varzim municipal flags.]]
'''Póvoa de Varzim City Center''' or '''Downtown Póvoa de Varzim''' (Portuguese, ''Centro'')  is the heart of [[Póvoa de Varzim]] in [[Portugal]], and is the location for most of the city's municipal services, tourist attractions and businesses. It is the center, not only for the city or the municipality, but also neighboring municipalities. The greater downtown area also called "Centro" can also include most districts part of [[Póvoa de Varzim Parish]].

Downtown, as defined by the City Hall, is arranged around [[Praça do Almada]], the civic center, and extends in all directions for a number of blocks, including [[Rua da Junqueira|Junqueira shopping street]], [[Passeio Alegre]] waterfront square, Mouzinho de Albuquerque business avenue, and Praça Marquês de Pombal (market square). It does not include the medieval and Discovery Age civic center of the city which is located in [[Bairro da Matriz]] district.

Despite proven to be occupied at least since the Roman period, Downtown developed its current layout in the 18th century, by royal order of Queen Mary I of Portugal due to the importance that Póvoa de Varzim got as the main seaport in Northern Portugal.

==Urban morphology==

[[File:Vista para Povoa de Varzim sec XIX.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Downtown skyline in mid-19th century.]]
[[File:Avenida Mouzinho Albuquerque Povoa Varzim.JPG|thumb|Mouzinho de Albuquerque avenue.]]
Downtown is limited to the North by [[Bairro Norte]], to the south by [[Bairro Sul]], to the east by [[Barreiros, Póvoa de Varzim|Barreiros]]/[[Moninhas]] and [[Bairro da Matriz|Matriz]]/[[Mariadeira]] and to the west it borders [[Redonda Beach]] and Póvoa Cove.

Downtown Póvoa de Varzim is, to a large extent, made up of pedestrian areas, with difficult car access in much of its extension, although underground parking spaces are available in the waterfront and in Avenida Mouzinho de Albuquerque.

===Civic Center===
[[Praça do Almada]], the civic center, is landscaped in an egg-shape, cut in half by the National Highway 13, and is tipped by buildings with local style. The building of the City Hall (1791) dominates the square. In the square, the Manueline pillory of Póvoa de Varzim (1514) is a national monument and represents Póvoa de Varzim's self-government and laws. Next to the pillory, the romantic gazebo (1904) follows the liking of the old Povoan bourgeoisie for its spare time.&lt;ref name="IPPAR"&gt;[http://www.igespar.pt/pt/patrimonio/pesquisa/geral/patrimonioimovel/detail/71021 Coreto da Praça do Almada] - IGESPAR&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junqueira shopping district===
Despite being pedestrian, [[Rua da Junqueira]] is the most famous and elder of those three streets. Junqueira, which links Praça do Almada to the waterfront, appeared in the written records in 1694, even though artifacts from the Roman era surfaced in diverse street rearrangements and is the site of an ancient Roman fish factory. In 1839, the Town Hall expressed concerns over urbanization issues due to popularity of this street, one of the busiest in Póvoa de Varzim, as it became in that century a full-blown shopping street, identity that it maintained to these days in which ancient stores survive.

Undersized but charismatic squares in Junqueira district, between Praça do Almada and Passeio Alegre (waterfront) can be found:  Praça da República and Largo David Alves.

===Old theater area===
From the surroundings of Praça do Almada, three parallel streets lead to the waterfront: Rua Tenente Valadim, that ends between the Casino and Grande Hotel, Rua da Junqueira and [[Rua Santos Minho]]. The later is related to the arts, most notably performing arts, since the 18th century. It was a square known as Campo das Cobras and the location of a theater since 1793, the local bullfighting arena and circus. The old building Salão Teatro (Theater Saloon) and [[Teatro Garrett]] Theater from the 19th century, with small artist's studios in the way, can still be found.

==History==
{{main|History of Póvoa de Varzim}}
Albeit inhabited since the Roman period, with Roman fish factories and a Roman villa. The seaport, a natural harbor, appeared in the written records in the 11th century, and the ship-making industry developed considerably in the 17th century, it was in the 18th century, with the fishing industry getting national importance, that defined the city center as it is today, with the Royal Provision by [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Mary I]] on February 21, 1791. The queen ordered ''Corregedor'' Almada to reorganize the town's layout given Póvoa's prosperity and importance in the fishing sector. Prior to development the area had [[lagoons]] in the port area such as Boído Lagoon and Galé Lagoon.

The new civic center (''Praça Nova'' - New Square) with a new town hall was built in an area used as a market square during some periods in the site of Boído Lagoon. The square was later renamed [[Praça do Almada]] in honor of Corregedor Almada efforts. The new square replaced the old town hall around [[Praça Velha]], the Old civic center.

Prior to that, [[Junqueira (Póvoa de Varzim)|Junqueira]] district was already a bustling fishing quarter. As the 19th century moved in, and beach therapy became popular with the elites, [[Junqueira (Póvoa de Varzim)|Junqueira]] became a bourgeois shopping street.

In late 19th century and under the visions of David Alves, when Póvoa de Varzim was already a prosperous beach resort, sections of the urbanized area, which didn't grew in an orderly way, were demolished to give way for Mousinho de Albuquerque Avenue, linking [[Passeio Alegre]] Square to uptown's [[Largo das Dores|Dores Square]] (''Largo das Dores''), where mansions for the wealthy beach goers started being built. During late 20th century, some of the mansions and ''Orfeão Poveiro'' music hall ruins were destroyed to give rise to multifamily homes. Despite its losses, Mousinho Avenue got a new character, it became a central business avenue and a rehabilitation program was done in the 21st century.

Around Rego Square, later [[Largo David Alves|David Alves square]], appeared some of the most charismatic entertainment venues of Póvoa in the 19th century, the Hotel Luso-Brazileiro, the Chinês Saloon, Garrett Theater, and other entertainment venues. Centering the plaza, the Chinês Saloon appeared in 1882 and became popular all over the country and the most famous casino of Póvoa alongside Café David. The elites could listen to music, see shows with Spanish dancers, meet in [[tertulia]] and play roulette.

Old bourgeois area par excellence, with the increasing business importance of Junqueira and Praça do Almada, whose spaces had been taken for tertiary activities such as shops and offices, in such a way that, today, only few people live in the most central areas of the city.&lt;ref name="deo"&gt;As Procissões na Póvoa de Varzim (1900–1950).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1630">'''Ragnar Kreuger''' (4 August 1897 &amp;ndash; 27 October 1997) was a [[Finnish people|Finnish]]  [[Industry|industrialist]] and amaterur [[ornithologist]].

From 1926 Kreuger acquired an engineering company, a construction firm, and electrical, now [[YIT]].
He started  [[Oology|birds egg-collecting]] as a little boy in the 1910s. In 1917 he bought his first Finnish private collection. He went on to collect birds eggs for more than 50 years. He acquired collections from across the globe. In 1962, he donated his collection of the [[University of Helsinki]], where it is maintained in the [[Finnish Museum of Natural History]] as Museum Oologicum R. Kreuger, but he continued to collect as a hobby, and to expand the collection even after the exchange and purchase of eggs was made illegal.

Kreuger was an avid [[hunter]]. He bought the island of Hättö in [[Ingå]] and introduced there a number of exotic plant and animal species. For instance, in 1939 he purchased [[Mouflon]] from Denmark. The animals were quarantined at the zoo then transferred to Hättö. The herd gradually began to increase and was in the late 1940s about 30 individuals.

'''Robert Allan''' (1847 &amp;ndash; 8 December 1927) was a prominent businessman and manufacturer of [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]].

==Early life==
Allan's parents arrived in New Zealand aboard the Thomas Harrison in 1842.  Born in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] in 1847,&lt;ref name="ChristchurchLibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/People/A/AllanRobert/|title=Robert Allan, 1847-1927|work=christchurchcitylibraries.com|publisher=Christchurch City Libraries|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/629z2ZJ2l|archivedate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allan and his family moved to [[Wellington]] for several years and to [[Port Levy]] in 1851.  The Allan family later settled in [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]]. Robert's father (also Robert) and uncle Magnus Allan were in business with John Grubb and notably were commissioned to construct the [[Canterbury Association]] wharf at Lyttelton for Captain [[Joseph Thomas (surveyor)|Joseph Thomas]].

==Early career==
Allan was educated at the Church of England School under later at the Scots School.  Joining the firm of J. T. Peacock &amp; Co. at 15, Allan began a prosperous mercantile career.  In the early 1870s he founded together with Mr Lightband, the boot and [[shoemaking|shoe manufacturer]]s and general importers Lightband, Allan &amp; Co.  This firm later became the national concern of Skelton, Frostick and Co. Ltd which was famous for manufacturing Zealandia brand boots.  In 1895 the firm erected a substantial four story brick building in Hereford Street, Christchurch which was the largest boot factory in the Colony.  After Allan's retirement and subsequent death, Skelton Frostick fell victim to the difficult conditions of the Great Depression and was liquidated in the 1930s.

==Involvement with Christchurch civic life==
In 1900, Allan was president of both the Industrial Association and of the Jubilee Exhibition committee for Canterbury.  He was appointed a Royal Reception Commissioner for the visit of the 1901 visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later [[King George V]] and Queen Mary) along with Sir [[Henry Wigram]] and Mr. Stead.  Allan was also active in the Canterbury [[Chamber of Commerce]], and one of the earliest members and the first treasurer of Christchurch's Union Rowing Club. He was a longtime director of the Kaiapoi Woollen Company, as well as [[electric lighting]] and tramway enterprises.

Allan, in personal capacity and in his role as director was heavily involved in the [[trade fair|promotional exhibition]]s of New Zealand made products.  As President of the Industrial Association (1879-1881) he presided over the first Christchurch Industrial Exhibition in 1880.  He was on the committee of the 1883 exhibition and in 1895 Robert had been elected a life member of the Association.  He was appointed chairman of the Early History Committee of the Association.  In 1900 Allan was President of both the Industrial Association and of the 1900 Jubilee Exhibition Committee.

Allan's role and experience in exhibitions made him a natural choice for one of the Executive Commissioners of the New Zealand International Exhibition in 1906.  G. S. Munro has been named as Government representative and Chairman of commissioners and Robert Allan named Vice-Chairman.  Other commissioners included Sir [[John Hall (New Zealand politician)|John Hall]] (Mayor of Christchurch) and Mr. William Reece (ex-Mayor). It appears that Munro's dictatorial approach and treatment of his fellow commissioners took a serious toll on the organising committee and it is likely that in frustration Allan withdrew from the commission, sighting ill health as the reason.  The Colonist of 11 August 1906 stated that Sir [[Joseph Ward]] had accepted Robert Allan's resignation. Though careful not to ascribe outright blame to Munro, the media were not fooled by the Allan's diplomatic resignation and pursued the matter that became known as "The Exhibition Trouble.’ `Sir Joseph Ward was forced to investigate the matter further.

==Family life==
On 14 April 1869 Allan was married to Martha Haswell Wood at St Michaels Church, [[Merivale]] by the Very Rvd. Dean Jacobs.  The couple had five daughters and two sons.  In 1881 Allan had purchased Glenmore in [[Hillsborough, Canterbury|Hillsborough]], [[Opawa]] from John Chapman who had bought the house the previous year from John Barton Arudnel Acland of Mt Peel station.  The house was built for Henry Selfe who was agent for the Canterbury Association but was rarely used by the first owner himself.  Today, Glenmore is a Category II listed home by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.

Allan later purchased Abberley in Springfield Avenue, [[St Albans, New Zealand|St Albans]], Christchurch.  Abberley had been built in 1863 by well known importer and merchant Thomas James Maling (1836-1922). It was a substantial home with vast gardens &amp;mdash; including a caged cherry orchard. The two hectare private garden is today the grounds of Abberley Park. The house was demolished in the 1930s after the City Council purchased the property.  Allan also owned rural land in Canterbury, Northland and a {{convert|1500|acre|adj=on}} sawmill at Tarawhiti. One of the properties at Nukutawhiti, Whangerai, was farmed by his son Robert S Allan.  Robert Allan was staying at Nukatawhiti, his son’s sheep station in Northland, at the time of his death in 1927. Martha and Robert Allan are buried in the [[Bromley Cemetery, Christchurch]].

'''Salem bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden''' ({{lang-ar|سالم م. بن لادن}}) (4 January 1946 – 29 May 1988) was a [[Saudi Arabia]]n investor and businessman.

==Life==
Considered the eldest son of [[Mohammed bin Laden]], the founder of [[Saudi Binladin Group]] and a half-brother of [[Osama bin Laden]]. Bin Laden was educated at [[Millfield]] and acted as the patriarch of the [[bin Laden family]] after the 1967 death of his father. Salem managed the family's extensive investment portfolio and was in charge of family income distribution. He also oversaw the individual education plans for each of his (half-) brothers and (half-) sisters. Just like his father, he highly valued close relationship of the bin Ladens with the [[Saudi royal family]]. He provided means and support to the family during the [[Grand Mosque Seizure|Mecca uprising of 1979]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bin Ladens: an Arabian family in the American century |last1= Coll|first1=Steve |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher= Penguin Press |location= United States |isbn= 978-1-59420-164-6 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_cjb96LrJIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bin+Ladens#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= 2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He owned a house in [[Orlando, Florida]], and often used it for vacation stays.&lt;ref name="pete"&gt;[[Peter Bergen|Bergen, Peter]], "[[Holy War, Inc.]]", 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/books/20080401_COLL_EXCERPT.html ‘The Bin Ladens’]
By Steve Coll, March 31, 2008, [[New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Salem bin Laden died on 29 May 1988, when he accidentally drifted into high voltage electrical power lines adjacent to the Kitty Hawk Field of Dreams Ultra-Lite Flying Field at the edge of [[Schertz, Texas|Schertz]], a northeastern [[San Antonio]] suburb. The Sprint [[Ultralight aircraft (United States)|ultralight aircraft]] he was flying fell 115 feet to the ground after the wire strike. Salem, who was not wearing a safety helmet, died of head injuries from the resulting fall. The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] did not conduct an accident investigation since the aircraft was an ultralight aircraft, which was not covered under their mandate due to exemption while operating under [[Federal Aviation Regulations|FAR]] Part 103 Provisions required by Federal law. The Schertz Police, who attended to the incident, stated in the report that Salem died in a freak accident.

This was the second plane crash-related death in the [[bin Laden family]], as Salem's father [[Mohammed bin Laden]] was also killed in a plane crash in 1967.

A third plane crash claimed more members of the bin Laden family on 31 July 2015 when a business jet carrying Osama bin Laden's half sister, Sana, and his stepmother, Rajaa Hashim, crashed at Blackbushe airport in Hampshire, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/aviation/11777536/Osama-bin-Ladens-sister-and-stepmother-feared-dead-in-Hampshire-plane-crash.html|title=Osama bin Laden's sister and stepmother killed in Hampshire plane crash|first=Patrick|last=Sawer|date=1 August 2015|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir David Baxter, 1st Baronet''' (1793–1872), was a [[linen]] manufacturer in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]], and a [[baronet]].  He also performed a considerable amount of [[philanthropy|philanthropic work]], benefiting his home city of Dundee and more widely Scottish education.

==Early life==
Baxter was the second son of William Baxter, of [[Balgavies]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], and was born in Dundee on 15 February 1793.{{sfn|Henderson|1885|p=426}} He was educated at the [[High School of Dundee|Dundee Academy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Business career==
While still a young man, he became manager of the Dundee Sugar Refining Company. The concern was never prosperous, and notwithstanding his prudent and energetic management it collapsed in 1826.{{sfn|Henderson|1885|p=426}} 

Thereupon he became partner in the linen manufacturing firm of Baxter brothers, which included his father William and his two younger brothers. William had begun business with a mill in [[Glamis]] and in 1822 had started business in dundee with his eldest son Edward, who left the company in 1825 to commence the business of a general merchant. From the time that David Baxter joined the firm he was practically its head, and on the death of his two brothers and his father within a few years afterwards he and the former manager of the works Peter Carmichael remained the sole partners.{{sfn|Henderson|1885|p=426}}&lt;ref name="Baxter Bros"&gt;{{cite web|title=MS 11 Baxter Brothers &amp; Co Ltd, linen and jute spinners and manufacturers, Dundee|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27ms%2011%27%29|website=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmichael"&gt;{{cite web|title=MS 102 Peter Carmichael of Arthurstone|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27ms%20102%27%29|website=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later joined by William Ogilvie Dalgleish, who was married to David Baxter's niece.&lt;ref name="Baxter Bros"/&gt;

In 1828 an attempt had been made by him to introduce [[power loom|power-loom]] weaving, but after a short trial it was abandoned until 1836, when its revival was followed by complete and extraordinary success. Through the mechanical skill of his partner Peter Carmichael in perfecting the machinery, and the business capacity and tact of David Baxter, the firm speedily became one of the largest manufacturing houses in the world; and to its remarkable success may be in a large degree ascribed the position which Dundee attained as the chief seat of the linen manufacture in Britain in the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Henderson|1885|p=426}}

Sir David Baxter was also a partner in Turnbull &amp; Co, later Boase &amp; Co, which operated a bleachfield at [[Claverhouse]], and was later fully taken over by Baxter Brothers.&lt;ref name="Boase"&gt;{{cite web|title=MS 10 Boase &amp; Co. Ltd, Claverhouse Bleachfield, Dundee|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27ms%2010%27%29|website=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=University of dundee|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public affairs and philanthropy==
Although much immersed in the cares of business, Baxter took an active, if not very prominent, share in public affairs. In 1825 he was chosen a [[police commissioner]], and in 1828 a guild councillor and member of the harbour board. A [[liberalism|liberal]] in politics, he took a lively interest in parliamentary elections, both in Dundee and in the county of [[Fife]], where in 1856 he purchased the estate of Kilmaron.

His enlightened regard for the welfare of his native town was, however, manifested chiefly in noble and generous benefactions which have given his name one of the highest places of honour in its annals. The most notable of these was perhaps his presentation, along with his sisters, of thirty-eight acres of land to Dundee as a [[pleasure garden]] and [[recreation ground]], which, under the name of the [[Baxter Park]], was opened by Earl Russell in September 1863. A £20,000 bequest on his death in 1872 led to the foundation of a mechanics' institute in 1888.{{sfn|Henderson|1885|p=426}}  Known then as the Dundee Technical Institute, it was the fore-runner of [[Abertay University]].&lt;ref name="Ten Taysiders"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ten Taysiders. Forgotten Figures from Dundee Angus and Perthshire|year=2011|publisher=Abertay Historical Society|location=Dundee|isbn=978-0-900019-48-7|author=Kenneth Baxter|page=34|chapter=Mary Ann Baxter:Philanthropist and Founder of University College Dundee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of the Albert Institute of Literature, Science, and Art (now the [[McManus Galleries]]) was due also chiefly to his liberality and that of his relatives; and in connection with [[Dundee Royal Infirmary]] he erected a convalescent home at [[Broughty Ferry]] at a cost of £30,000.{{sfn|Henderson|1885|p=426}} 

More important than his benefactions to Dundee were his gifts in behalf of higher education in Scotland. Besides building and endowing at [[Cupar, Fife]] a seminary for the education of young ladies, he established several important foundations in the [[University of Edinburgh]], including scholarships in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[physical science]], and [[natural science]], each of the annual value of £60; and a [[Regius Professor of Engineering (Edinburgh)|chair of engineering]], with an endowment of £5,000, which was supplemented by an annual parliamentary vote of £200.{{sfn|Henderson|1885|p=426}} 

On 24 January 1863 he was created a [[baronet]] 'of [[Kilmaron]] in the [[County of Fife]]'.{{sfn|Henderson|1885|p=426}}{{sfn|Gazette|22697}}

Soon thereafter he acquired 5 Moray Place, a huge Georgian townhouse on the [[Moray Estate]] in western Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1879&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacies==
He died 13 October 1872.{{sfn|Henderson|1885|p=426}}  Of Baxter's heritable and personal property, valued at £1,200,000, one half was divided among near relatives, and the other among distant relations and public institutions, the largest legacies being £50,000 to the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], £40,000 pounds to Edinburgh University, and £20,000 towards the foundation of a mechanics' institute in Dundee, later [[Abertay University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|1885|p=426}} cites  ''[[The Times]]'', 20 December 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his last illness Baxter's attention was occupied with a scheme for linking Dundee with the neighbouring [[University of St. Andrews]], and although he did not survive to carry out his plans, his relatives helped found [[University College, Dundee]]. Towards the purchase of buildings and general equipment of this college one of his sisters [[Mary Ann Baxter]] who died unmarried on 19 December 1884, contributed £150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|1885|pp=426–427}} cites  ''The Times'', 20 December 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1833 Baxter married to Elizabeth (1801-1882{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}), daughter of R. Montgomerie, of Barrahill, [[Ayrshire]]. Elizabeth survived him, and they had no children.{{sfn|Henderson|1885|p=426}} She was buried with him in the old churchyard in the centre of [[Cupar]] in [[Fife]], just west of the church.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4786">The '''Softwarepark Hagenberg''' is the Austrian [[technology park]] for [[software]], located in [[Hagenberg im Mühlkreis]], [[Austria]], founded in 1989 by Professor [[Bruno Buchberger]]. The Softwarepark Hagenberg is a unique collaboration where research, business and education are intensively cooperating.&lt;ref name="wb2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="orf1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oesterreich.orf.at/ooe/stories/90872/|title=Der Softwarepark Hagenberg|publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF.at]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orf1" /&gt; Because of its success, the park has been called the "Wunder von Hagenberg" (miracle from Hagenberg).&lt;ref name="wb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wirtschaftsblatt.at/home/oesterreich/unternehmen/wirtschaftsraum/318535/index.do|title=Weitere 50 Millionen € für das Wunder von Hagenberg|last=Gansrigler|first=Franz|date=19 March 2008|publisher=[[WirtschaftsBlatt]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Buchberger devised the concept for the park in 1989. It was created to balance both economic needs and desire for research and as such, the concept focused one third on economic production, one third on research and one third on academic education in the field of IT and related sciences.&lt;ref name="orf1" /&gt; These three components drive a synergetic "spirale of innovation". Softwarepark has four main partners: The Province of Upper Austria, the [[Johannes Kepler University Linz]], the [http://www.hagenberg.at Community of Hagenberg], and Raiffeisen Landesbank Oberösterreich, a major local bank.&lt;ref name="wb2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nachrichten1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/reportage/art57,104515|title=Softwarepark will Anzahl der Mitarbeiter verdoppeln|last=Rubasch|first=Ulrike|date=4 February 2009|publisher=nachrichten.at|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first institute to be established in the park was Buchberger's [[Research Institute for Symbolic Computation]] (RISC) with then 25 students and employees.&lt;ref name="wb1" /&gt;

Today Softwarepark is increasing its international activities, e.g. with [http://www.isi-hagenberg.at/ ISI - International Studies in Informatics Hagenberg] or the recently launched [https://web.archive.org/web/20100620053308/http://www.international-incubator.com/ International Incubator Hagenberg].

Within the twenty years of its existence, 100 million € were invested into developing the park.&lt;ref name="wb2" /&gt;

==Composition==
The park currently houses 50 companies with more than 1000 employees as well as more than 1400 students of a number of universities and colleges, amongst them the [[Research Institute for Symbolic Computation]],&lt;ref name="wb2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wirtschaftsblatt.at/home/oesterreich/unternehmen/oberoesterreich/363389/index.do?_vl_pos=r.3.MOST|title=20 Millionen € für den Softwarepark Hagenberg|last=Leitner|first=Karl|date=24 February 2009|publisher=[[WirtschaftsBlatt]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wb1" /&gt; and the Software Competence Center Hagenberg SCCH&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scch.at/en/ Software Competence Center Hagenberg&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the Austrian [[COMET – Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies|COMET]] program.

Additionally, the park houses a social project for people with disabilities to provide computer support in cooperation with the [[Diakonisches Werk]] [[Gallneukirchen]] and the [[Fachhochschule Hagenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/2282479|title=Sozialprojekt schneidert Maß-PC|last=Tzschentke|first=Karin|date=29 December 2005|publisher=[[Der Standard]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
The current expansion schedule plans to expand the park with 20 million € in funds until 2012, with the expansion of the [[Research Institute for Symbolic Computation]] as well as a hotel, sport arenas and an international student union building.&lt;ref name="wb2" /&gt; An additional 50 million € are planned to be invested until 2014 for the expansion of the companies and research institutes in the park.&lt;ref name="wb1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nachrichten1" /&gt;

'''''Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle''''' is a 2009 book by [[Dan Senor]] and [[Saul Singer]] about the [[economy of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saul Singer interview on Startup Camel Podcast about the challenges Israel is facing as a global innovation leader.|url=http://startupcamel.com/ep-30-saul-singer-startup-nation|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=Startup Camel}}&lt;/ref&gt; It examines how Israel, a 60-year-old nation with a population of 7.1 million, was able to reach such economic growth that "at the start of 2009, some 63 Israeli companies were listed on the [[NASDAQ]], more than those of any other foreign country."&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

In 2010, ''Start-up Nation'' was ranked fifth on the business [[bestseller]] list of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/books/bestseller/besthardbusiness.html NYT Hardcover Business Best Sellers]&lt;/ref&gt; It also reached ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' bestseller list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjp.org/local_includes/downloads/46889.pdf The Massachusetts-Israel Economic Relationship]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book overview==
The [[Council on Foreign Relations]] states in its publisher's blurb for the book that ''Start-up Nation'' addresses the question: "How is it that Israel—a country of 7.1 million people, only sixty years old, surrounded by enemies, in a constant state of war since its founding, with no natural resources—produces more start-up companies than large, peaceful, and stable nations like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada, and the United Kingdom?"&lt;ref name=CFR/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' notes that Israel now has more high-tech [[Startup company|start-ups]] and a larger [[Venture capital in Israel|venture capital industry]] per capita than any other country in the world. The success of Israel's high-tech sector over the past two decades has attracted recent attention from business journalists and ''The Economist'' describes ''Start-up Nation'' as the most notable of a "growing pile" of books on the subject.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

In their attempt to explain Israel's success in this area, Senor and Singer discard "the argument from ethnic or religious exceptionalism, dismissing 'unitary Jewishness' or even individual talent as major reasons for Israel's high-tech success" and analyze two major factors that, in the authors' opinion, contribute most to Israel's economic growth. Those factors are [[Conscription in Israel|mandatory military service]] and [[Aliyah|immigration]].&lt;ref name=CFR/&gt;

The authors argue that a major factor for Israel's economic growth can be found in the culture of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], in which service is mandatory for most young Israelis. The authors believe that IDF service provides potential entrepreneurs with the opportunities to develop a wide array of skills and contacts. They also believe that IDF service provides experience exerting responsibility in a relatively un-hierarchical environment where creativity and intelligence are highly valued.&lt;ref name=oreilly/&gt; IDF soldiers "have minimal guidance from the top, and are expected to improvise, even if this means breaking some rules. If you're a junior officer, you call your higher-ups by their first names, and if you see them doing something wrong, you say so."&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; Neither [[Military rank|rank]]s nor ages matter much "when taxi drivers can command millionaires and 23-year-olds can train their uncles," and "Israeli forces regularly vote to oust their unit leaders."&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

The book also dwells at length on immigration and its role in Israel's economic growth: "Immigrants are not averse to start from scratch. They are by definition risk-takers. A nation of immigrants is a nation of entrepreneurs. From survivors of the Holocaust to Soviet refuseniks through the Ethiopian Jews, the State of Israel never ceased to be a land of immigration: 9 out of 10 Jewish Israelis today are immigrants or descendants of immigrants the first or second generation. This specific demographic, causing fragmentation of community that still continues in the country, is nevertheless a great incentive to try their luck, to take risks because immigrants have nothing to lose."&lt;ref name=inaglobal/&gt;

Additional factors cited by the authors include a sense of dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs, a culture where individuals frequently tinker with technology, and government policies friendly to start-ups.&lt;ref name=oreilly/&gt;

Using stories and anecdotes, the book provides examples of Israel's technological and medical achievements, among them "the Israeli innovations that made possible Google Suggest, the list of suggestions that appear instantly in menu form as you type a search request, the capsule endoscopy, a miniature camera embedded in a pill so that 18 photos per second can be wirelessly and painlessly transmitted from gastrointestinal tracts."&lt;ref name="The Weekly Standard"/&gt;

While the book describes Israel's many successes in technological innovation, it also attempts to address, in the words of one reviewer, why Israel still lacks its own [[Nokia]], [[Samsung]], or [[IBM]]. According to the book's authors, this is partly because Israeli startups tend to be bought up by large foreign companies and partly because Israeli business has thus far failed to develop the kind of mature management culture needed to run such companies.&lt;ref name=Monitor/&gt;

Senor and Singer interviewed over 100 people to write the book, among them leading Israeli venture investors including key players in [[Google]], [[Intel]], and [[Cisco]]; and historians, U.S. military leaders, and Israeli heads of state.&lt;ref&gt;Senor and Singer, pp. 240-241.&lt;/ref&gt; Their conclusion is that "while Israel has much to learn from the world, the world has much to learn from Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Senor and Singer, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authors==

Dan Senor is a former foreign policy official in the [[United States]] government. He served as chief spokesmen for the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] in [[Iraq]] and now advises venture capital firms. Saul Singer is a columnist and former [[editorial page]] editor for ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"/&gt;

==Critical reception==

===Praise===
Jon Rosen OF ''[[USA Today]]'' believes that the book is written from an Israeli perspective and may irk those with reservations about Israeli foreign policy, but it is still an accomplishment, "not simply for exposing the roots of Israel's success, but by showing what the Israeli case might teach the rest of the world."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt; In ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [[James K. Glassman]] says that "the greatest strength of ''Start-up Nation'' is not analysis but anecdote. The authors tell vivid stories of entrepreneurial success, such as that of Shai Agassi, the son of an Iraqi immigrant to Israel, with his electric-automobile technology, now in the process of creating 'Car 2.0.'"&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' states that "the authors ground their analysis in case studies and interviews with some of Israel's most brilliant innovators to make this a rich and insightful read not just for business leaders and policy makers but for anyone curious about contemporary Israeli culture."&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"/&gt;

In ''[[The Economic Times]]'', [[R Gopalakrishnan]] writes that the use of [[Hebrew]] expressions makes the book "alive and eminently-readable."&lt;ref name="The Economic Times"/&gt; Besides ''chutzpah'', the authors use the word ''bitzua'', which roughly means "getting things done." Another Hebrew expression used in the book is ''rosh gadol'', literally "big head", which could be translated "can-do and responsible attitude with scant respect for the limitations of formal authority." Gopalakrishnan concludes that the ideas demonstrated in the book "are highly relevant for innovation capability in general, but for India, especially at this juncture."&lt;ref name="The Economic Times"/&gt;

[[David Horovitz]] of ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' says that conclusions of ''Start-up Nation'' find confirmation in the real world, such as  how the life of Congresswoman [[Gabrielle Giffords]] was saved when an emergency medical team applied a revolutionary elasticized bandage developed in Israel to staunch her head wounds.&lt;ref name=TJP/&gt;

A review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' says that "the book weaves together colorful stories of Israeli technological triumphs" such as the story of [[Shvat Shaked]], who "founded a cybersecurity firm with his old buddy from Army intelligence and had the chutzpah to bet a top executive at PayPal, the online commerce company owned by eBay, that his few dozen engineers could beat PayPal's thousands in developing secure online software."&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"/&gt; The review also states that the authors could have done a better job drawing "straight lines between their theories about Israel's success and these case studies".&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"/&gt;

Maureen Farrell of ''[[Forbes]]'' was disappointed that the authors mostly ignored the effects of U.S. foreign aid, but says the book "is worth reading to understand not just Israel's history but the history of capitalism and innovation."&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

===Criticism===
Ruth Schuster, reviewing the book for ''[[Haaretz]]'', feels that it is "tarnished by a jarring, tub-thumping patriotism."&lt;ref name=haaretzrev /&gt; A review in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' notes that "critics say that the story behind how a country of 7 million has more Nasdaq-listed companies than Europe is more complex than Singer and Senor paint it to be."&lt;ref name=Monitor/&gt;

Economist [[Yusuf Mansur]], writing in the ''[[Jordan Times]]'', argues that two of the factors to which Senor and Singer attribute Israel's success, the IDF and Soviet-Jewish immigration, have only been sustainable because of the foreign aid that Israel receives from the United States and private sources. Mansur also faults the authors for suggesting that the disparity between entrepreneurship in Israel's Arab and Jewish sectors is rooted in the exemption of Arabs from military service rather than what Mansour perceives to be "the discriminatory policies of Israel against its Arab citizens," particularly in education and the labor market.&lt;ref name=jordantimes&gt;[http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=25450 "Financing 'the start-up nation'"], ''Jordan Times'', April 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gal Beckerman, writing in ''[[The Forward]]'' magazine, observes that the book "presents Israel in an extremely positive light as a bastion of entrepreneurial spirit and technological achievement. It skirts a discussion of the conflict with the Palestinians, or even the wealth inequality within Israel, thereby dovetailing nicely with recent public relations efforts by Israel to shift attention away from its problems and toward its achievements."&lt;ref name=beckerman&gt;Beckerman, Gal: [http://www.forward.com/articles/126843/ "Senor Decides Against Running for Senate, Citing Family and Business"], ''[[The Forward]]'', March 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Journalists and policymakers in several countries have recommended ''Start-up Nation'' as a useful guide for promoting entrepreneurship. A review of the book in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' calls on Ireland to follow Israel's model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0626/1224273322693.html What Ireland has to learn from Israel's high tech companies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrius Kubilius]], the prime minister of Lithuania, has cited ''Start-up Nation'' as his favorite book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.themarker.com/startup-nation-without-physics-teachers-1.333940 Startup nation without physics teachers], [[Haaretz]]&lt;/ref&gt; Yrjö Ojasaar, managing partner of Solon Partners, an executive consulting and angel investor company in Estonia, says "there is much to be learned from the Israeli experience of venture capital incubation through building incentives for privatization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solonpartners.com/?p=961 Solon Partners: Start-up Nation. The Story of Israel’s Economic Miracle]&lt;/ref&gt; CNN's [[Fareed Zakaria]] called ''Start-up Nation'' "a book every single Arab businessman, Arab bureaucrat, and Arab politician should read."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2009/11/09/gps.book.of.the.week.cnn |title=Book of the Week |work=[[Fareed Zakaria GPS]] |publisher=CNN |date=November 19, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is cited as a handbook of "classic economics." It teaches small businesses "how effective a cohesive team can be, especially when that team places an emphasis on [[chutzpah]] first."&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallbiztrends.com/2009/12/start-up-nation-business-lessons-from-israel.html Start-Up Nation: Business Lessons from Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian Prime Minister [[Salam Fayyad]] reportedly keeps a copy of ''Start-up Nation'' on his desk as a source of inspiration for the [[West Bank]]'s own burgeoning technology industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israeli Technology Companies Turn to West Bank for Outsourcing |author=Gwen Ackerman |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-15/israeli-technology-companies-turn-to-west-bank-for-outsourcing.html |newspaper=Bloomberg News |date=March 15, 2011 |accessdate=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Texas School Book Depository''', now known as the '''Dallas County Administration Building''', is a seven-floor building facing [[Dealey Plaza]] in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], [[United States]]. The building is most notable as the vantage point of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963. An employee, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], allegedly shot and killed Kennedy from a sixth floor window on the building's southeastern corner. The structure is a [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark]]. It is located at 411 Elm Street on the northwest corner of Elm and [[Houston Street (Dallas)|North Houston Street]]s, at the western end of [[downtown Dallas]].

==Early history==
The site of the building was originally owned by [[John Neely Bryan]].&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jdt01 |title=The Handbook of Texas Online: Texas School Book Depository |author=Texas State Historical Association |authorlink=Texas State Historical Association |year=2012 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |work=Tshaonline.org |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1880s, Maxime Guillot operated a wagon shop on the property. In 1894, the Rock Island Plow Company bought the land, and four years later constructed a five-story building for its Texas division, the Southern Rock Island Plow Company.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; In 1901, the building was hit by lightning and nearly burned to the ground. It was rebuilt in 1902 in the Commercial [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style, and expanded to seven stories. In 1937 the property was acquired by the Carraway Byrd Corporation, and after the company defaulted on the loan, it was bought at public auction July 4, 1939 by [[D. Harold Byrd]].&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Organ&gt;Jerry Organ (2000). [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/organ4.htm "Murder Perch to Museum"]. [[Marquette University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Byrd's ownership the building remained empty until 1940, when it was leased by a grocery wholesaler, the [[Sexton Foods|John Sexton &amp; Co.]] Sexton Foods used this location as the branch office for sales, manufacturing and distribution warehouse for the south and southwest United States. In November 1961, Sexton Foods moved to a modern distribution facility located at 650 Regal Row Dallas; by then the building was known locally as the Sexton Building. Refurbishment after Sexton's departure saw the addition on the first four floors of partitions, carpeting, air conditioning and a new passenger elevator.&lt;ref name=Organ/&gt;

==Assassination of John F. Kennedy==
{{main|Assassination of John F. Kennedy}}
In 1963, the building was in use as a multi-floor [[warehouse]] providing the storage of school [[textbook]]s and other related materials as well as an order-fulfillment center by the privately owned [[Texas School Book Depository Company]]. Some time after the company had moved in, it was found that the upper floors had sustained oil damage from items stored there by the previous tenant, a wholesaler grocer. To protect the company's books (stored in cardboard boxes) from oil seeping up from the floor, a process to cover the floors with plywood had begun.&lt;ref name=Organ/&gt;  Immediately before the President Kennedy's visit to Dallas, work on the west side of the sixth floor had started, "leaving the whole scene in disarray, with stock shifted as far as the east wall, and stacks in between piled unusually high."&lt;ref name=Organ/&gt;

On November 22, 1963, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], a 24-year-old former [[USMC|U.S. Marine]] who was working as a temporary employee at the building, fired three shots from a sixth floor window at the presidential motorcade, [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|killing]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]].

===Second building===
In addition to its building at Elm and Houston, the Texas School Book Depository Company maintained a second warehouse at 1917 Houston. Several blocks north of the main building, the short four-story structure was well removed from the parade route, half-hidden on an unpaved section of Houston. Oswald's supervisor, Roy Truly, told the Warren Commission that he had had the option to assign Oswald to either building on his first day at work. "I might have sent Oswald to work [there]... Oswald and another fellow reported for work on the same day [October 15] and I needed one of them for the depository building. I picked Oswald."&lt;ref name=Bugliosi1455&gt;{{Cite book |title=Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy |last=Bugliosi |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Bugliosi |year=2007 |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |isbn=978-0-393-04525-3 |page=1455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This second building was eventually destroyed to make way for the [[Texas State Highway Spur 366|Woodall Rodgers Freeway]].&lt;ref name=Bugliosi1455/&gt;

During his two terms as mayor of Dallas, [[Wes Wise]] guided Dallas out from under the cloud of the assassination and at the same time saved the Texas School Book Depository from imminent destruction, preserving it for further research into the president's murder.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, James W.

The Texas School Book Depository Company moved out in 1970 and the building was sold at auction to [[Aubrey Mayhew]], a [[Nashville, Tennessee]] music producer and collector of Kennedy memorabilia, by the owner D. H. Bard. In 1972, ownership reverted to Bard, and the building was purchased in 1977 by the government of [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]]. After renovating the lower five floors of the building for use as county government offices, the Dallas County Administration Building was dedicated on March 29, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Assassination and commemoration : JFK, Dallas, and the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza|last=Fagin|first=Stephen|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2013|isbn=9780806143583|location=Norman|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore Augustus Havemeyer''' (May 17, 1839 – April 26, 1897) was an American businessman who was the first president of the [[U.S. Golf Association]] and co-founder of the [[Newport Country Club]], host to both the first [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] and the first [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_QFXDK6XmeQC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Golf and the American country club] by Richard J. Moss (University of Illinois Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Havemeyer was born in New York City on May 17, 1839.  He was the eldest son of three children born to Frederick Christian Havemeyer Jr. (1807-1891), and Sarah Louise ([[née]] Henderson) Havemeyer (1812-1851).  His mother died in 1851 and he was then raised with the help of his grandmothers, Mary Osborne Henderson and Catharine Billiger Havemeyer, and his oldest sister, Mary Havemeyer. The family lived in a house at 193 West 14th Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trow's New York City Directory, 1854/1855|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnfij4;view=1up;seq=331|accessdate=24 September 2016}} Note: 14th Street was renumbered in 1869.&lt;/ref&gt; in what was then the northern frontier of New York City.  Theodore studied at Mr. Betts' School ([[Betts Academy]]) in [[Stamford, Connecticut]].{{sfnp|Havemeyer|2010|p=5-7, 17}}

Theodore's grandfather, a [[German people|German]] immigrant, came to the United States in 1802 and started a sugar refining company with his brother and Theodore's father started his own firm, Havemeyer &amp; Elder.&lt;ref name="TAHObit1897"&gt;{{cite news|title=DEATH OF T.

==Career==
Theodore became an apprentice in his father's firm and later was made a partner working with his brother [[Henry Osborne Havemeyer]].  After traveling to Germany and England, in search of new advances in the sugar refining trade, Theodore constructed "one of the most modern sugar refineries in the world."&lt;ref name=bischoff&gt;Henry Bischoff and Mitchell Kahn, ''From Pioneer Settlement to Suburb, A History of Mahwah, New Jersey, 1700-1976'', (South Brunswick and New York:  A.

It started out with the design, manufacturing and sale of [[reverse vending machine]]s (RVMs) for automated collection of used [[beverage containers]].&lt;ref name="About_Tomra"/&gt; Through 70s a breakthrough for Tomra was in 1974 where the Swedish entity [[Systembolaget]] ordered 100 RVMs.&lt;ref name="Green_Machine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jørgensen|first1=Finn Arne|title=Making a green machine : the infrastructure of beverage container recycling|date=2011|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=978-0813550541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s-2000s ===
TOMRA was listed in [[Oslo Børs]] on 18 January 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oslobors.no/ob_eng/markedsaktivitet/#/details/TOM.OSE/data|title=Tomra Systems: Details|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Oslo Børs]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tried to secure a position in the American market to no avail.&lt;ref name="Green_Machine"/&gt; It was then successfully attempted to enter the market in 1990s. By 1999, sales in the US accounted for more than half of total revenues. In 2006, TOMRA delivered more than 8000 new reverse vending systems to Germany.&lt;ref name="Green_Machine"/&gt;

TOMRA's sensor-based sorting technology business was first established in 2004 with the acquisition of ''TiTech Visionsort AS'', a provider of optical recognition and sorting technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomra.com/en/news-and-media/news/2004/tomra-acquires-leading-recycling-company/|title=TOMRA acquires leading recycling company|last=|first=|date=2004-07-12|website=Tomra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was renamed to ''Tomra Sorting Solutions'' in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://waste-management-world.com/a/titech-rebrands-as-tomra-sorting-solutions|title=Titech Rebrands as Tomra Sorting Solutions|last=|first=|date=2012-02-17|website=Waste Management World|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), from ''Ferd AS'' for 219 million NOK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomra.com/en/news-and-media/news/2004/formal-closing-of-titech-acquisition-completed/|title=Formal closing of TiTech acquisition completed|last=|first=|date=2004-08-25|website=Tomra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the acquisition of ''Orwak'' in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/tomra-systems-asa-acquires-orwak-group-ab/|title=Tomra Systems ASA Acquires Orwak Group AB; reverse vending manufacturers secures shares in baling operation|last=|first=|date=2005-03-04|website=Recycling Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; TOMRA established itself as a producer of compaction and baling solutions with an installed base of more than 67,000 [[baler]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomra.com/default.asp?V_ITEM_ID=1273] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921171658/http://www.tomra.com/default.asp?V_ITEM_ID=1273 |date=21 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, TOMRA sold the ''Orwak'' operations in Norway, Sweden, Poland and Japan under the name ''TOMRA Compaction'' to ''San Sac Nordic AB'' of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomra.com/en/news-and-media/news/2014/tomra-compaction-acquired-by-san-sac/|title=TOMRA Compaction acquired by San Sac|last=|first=|date=2014-12-15|website=Tomra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 31, 2005, ''TOMRA Latasa Reciclagem S.A.'', offering aluminium can collection and recycling assets services in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, was acquired by [[Aleris International, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=23723280|title=Company Overview of Tomra Latasa Reciclagem S.A.|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2006, TOMRA’s subsidiary ''Titech Visionsort AS'' acquired 100 percent of the shares of Germany-based ''CommoDaS GmbH'', a provider of recognition and sorting technology for metals, plastics, glass, minerals and gems, for approximately 100 million NOK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomra.com/en/news-and-media/news/2006/acquisition-of-commodas-gmbh/|title=Acquisition of CommoDas GmbH|last=|first=|date=2006-06-07|website=Tomra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 Juli 2008 TOMRA announced it bought Australian peer ''Ultrasort Group'', a provider of advanced recognition and sorting technology to the mining industry, for 160 million NOK ($31.48 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/ultrasort-tomra-idINOSL00136820080701|title=Tomra buys Australian Ultrasort for $31 mln|last=|first=|date=2008-07-01|website=[[Reuters]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010-2016 ===
Via several acquisitions, TOMRA had grown into a global company since the 2000s and secured 75% global market share in [[Reverse vending machine|RVMs]] and 60% Material Recovery from Collection Solutions and 40%-65% in Sorting Solutions.&lt;ref name="Oslo_Bors"/&gt;

On 12 December 2010, TOMRA's subsidiary ''TiTech'' acquired [[Dublin]]-based food technology company ''Odenberg'', a designer of equipment used for producing 65 per cent of all [[French fries]] worldwide, for up to 57.5 million Euro from ''ACT Venture Capital'' in Dublin and members of the Van den Bergh family in Belgium;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/irish-food-tech-firm-odenberg-sold-for-up-to-57-5m-1.687350|title=Irish food tech firm Odenberg sold for up to €57.5m|last=Hancock|first=Ciaran|date=2010-12-15|website=[[The Irish Times]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odenberg's chilling/freezing unit was later considered a non-core business and sold in 2013 as to a newly formed company, ''Power Food Technology Ltd.'', of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodengineeringmag.com/articles/90662-new-types-of-foreign-material-a?page=2|title=Mergers and Acquisitions in Inspection Systems|last=Knights|first=Mikell|date=2013-05-13|website=Food Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2011, TOMRA sold the assets of ''Tomra Pacific, Inc.'', a recycler of used beverage containers in California, to ''rePlanet, LLC'' for approximately $25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inpublic.globenewswire.com/2012/01/02/TOMRA+divests+its+California+operation+HUG1574496.html|title=TOMRA divests its California operation|last=|first=|date=2012-01-02|website=[[GlobeNewswire]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, TOMRA purchased 100% of Belgium-based food [[Optical sorting|sorting]] specialist ''Best Kwadraat'' for 138 million Euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakeryandsnacks.com/Processing-Packaging/Best-acquired-by-TOMRA-Group-for-138m|title=Best acquired by TOMRA Group for €138m|last=Harrington|first=Rory|date=2012-06-04|website=Bakery and Snacks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016 TOMRA signed an agreement to acquire ''Compac Holding Ltd.,'' a New Zealand-based provider of packing house automation systems that sort fresh produce based on weight, size, shape, color, surface blemishes, and internal quality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1610/S00354/tomra-acquires-nz-sorting-machine-manufacturer-compac.htm|title=TOMRA acquires NZ Sorting Machine Manufacturer Compac|last=|first=|date=2016-10-12|website=Scoop Business|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $70 million plus up to $230 million in earn-outs available to Compac founders;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/correct-230m-earn-outs-available-compac-vendors-assuming-turnaround-b-200119|title=Up to $230 million in earn-outs available to Compac founders|last=Smellie|first=Pattrick|date=2017-03-01|website=National Business Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the transaction was completed in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomra.com/en/solutions-and-products/sorting-solutions/food/newsletter-food-for-thought/2017/a-closer-look-compac/|title=TOMRA completes COMPAC acquisition|last=|first=|date=2017-03-08|website=Tomra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition law compliance ==
In 2001, the EU Commission performed an investigation of Tomra’s competition law compliance. Based on this investigation, the Commission concluded in March 2006 that TOMRA in their opinion had foreclosed competition in the period 1998 to 2002 in the market for reverse vending machines in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden by implementing an exclusionary strategy. TOMRA appealed the decision to the European General Court in 2006.

In September 2010, the Court issued their judgment where they dismissed Tomra’s appeal both on the substance and on the amount of the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62006TJ0155&amp;from=EN|title=JUDGMENT OF THE GENERAL COURT (Fifth Chamber): Case T-155/06 Tomra Systems ASA and Others vs European Commission|last=|first=|date=2010-09-09|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; TOMRA consequently accrued 28.2 million Euro (NOK 226.1 million) for the fine and accumulated interest in the third quarter financial statement for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomra.com/en/news-and-media/news/2010/third-quarter-2010-results/|title=Third quarter 2010 results|last=|first=|date=2010-10-19|website=Tomra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; TOMRA appealed this decision again but finally lost the case in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://united-kingdom.taylorwessing.com/en/news-insights/details/when-will-discounts-and-rebates-in-supply-agreements-be-anti-competitive-2012-05-09.html|title=When will discounts and rebates in supply agreements be anti-competitive?|last=|first=|date=2012-05-09|website=[[Taylor Wessing]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tomra T-820 BC Blue.jpg|thumb|right|The images shows a TOMRA T-820 BC (Bottle and Crate) machine.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23399">'''"Tone at the top"''' is a term that originated in the field of [[accounting]] and is used to describe an organization's general ethical climate, as established by its board of directors, audit committee, and senior management. Having good tone at the top is believed by business ethics experts to help prevent fraud and other unethical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TONE AT THE TOP Definition|url=http://www.ventureline.com/accounting-glossary/T/tone-at-the-top-definition/|publisher=VentureLine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=David A.|title=An Examination of How Entry-Level Staff Auditors Respond to Tone at the Top vis-à-vis Tone at the Bottom|journal=Behavioral Research in Accounting|date=Spring 2015|volume=27|issue=1|url=http://www.aaajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2308/bria-50918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The concept of tone at the top originated in [[Big Four (audit firms)|audit firms]], where it referred fairly narrowly to the attitude of an organization's senior leadership towards [[Internal control|internal financial controls]]. It was popularized following a series of major [[corporate accounting scandals]] such as those affecting [[Enron]], [[Tyco International]], [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]], [[Peregrine Systems]] and [[WorldCom]], when the concept was strongly emphasized in the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002]] as important in the prevention and detection of [[fraud]] and other unethical financial practices. Today the term is applied very broadly, including in the fields of general management, [[information security]], law and [[software development]], and is often used to describe the general corporate culture established by an organization's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krause|first=edited by Harold F. Tipton, Micki|title=Information security management handbook, v. 3|year=2000|publisher=Auerbach|location=Boca Raton, Fl|isbn=1420090925|pages=133–134|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Terry|title=Your Time or Your Money: Groundswell supports less billable hours, alternate tracks to the top|newspaper=The ABA Journal {{!}} The lawyer's magazine|date=February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=William E.|title=Effective methods for software testing|year=2006|publisher=Wiley Publishing|location=Indianapolis, Ind.|isbn=0764598376|pages=51 and 60|edition=3rd ed. --}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The tone at the top is often considered to permeate an entire organization, and good tone at the top is considered a prerequisite for solid [[corporate governance]]. It has been said that [[Board of directors|boards of directors]] have a dual role: creating codes of conduct, and living by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Regan|first=David|title=Auditor's Dictionary: Terms, Concepts, Processes, and Regulations.|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd|location=New York|isbn=0471531189|pages=257|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good organizational tone is set through policies, codes of ethics, a commitment to hiring competent employees, and the development of [[reward structures]] that promote good internal controls and effective governance. In an analysis of ethical leadership, [[KPMG]] described ethical leaders as those who are receptive to employees' ethical concerns, value ethics and integrity over short-term business goals, and respond appropriately if they become aware of misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunn|first=Leonard J. Brooks, Paul|title=Business &amp; professional ethics for directors, executives, &amp; accountants|year=2010|publisher=South Western Cengage Learning|location=Mason, OH|isbn=0324594550|pages=261|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auditors typically interview an organization's leaders as part of the [[audit fieldwork]] in order to assess tone at the top, because poor tone is associated with malfeasance. Questions commonly asked include "how is the board compensated," "how active is the [[audit committee]]," "what is the nature of the organization's [[corporate culture]]," "what pressures are there to make [[sales targets|sales and earnings goals]]," "how is wrong-doing dealt with," "do employees understand their individual responsibilities for controls," "do monitoring controls signal failures in a timely fashion so corrective action can be taken," and "is there evidence that the employee [[Ethical code|code of ethics]] is complied with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnstone|first=Larry E. Rittenberg, Bradley J. Schwieger, Karla M.|title=Auditing: a business risk approach|year=2008|publisher=Thomson/South-Western|location=Mason, OH|isbn=0324375581|pages=353–354|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important fraud factors include pressure to reach goals, incentives and meeting expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Management can prevent fraud in the Workplace|url=http://www.acfe.com/uploadedFiles/ACFE_Website/Content/documents/tone-at-the-top-research.pdf|publisher=Association of Certified Fraud Examiners|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failures==
Experts say that weaknesses in the "tone at the top" have been associated with most modern financial frauds. Poor tone at the top may include a disdain for [[internal control]]s, an overemphasis on [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] at the expense of [[Business ethics|ethics]], a belief that [[Legal governance, risk management, and compliance#Legal compliance|compliance with the law]] is sufficient for defensible ethical conduct, the canvassing and accommodating of some [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] but not others, blaming higher-ups or colleagues for unethical practices, having one's judgement clouded due to [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]], and a misunderstanding of and lack of adherence to public expectations of what constitutes ethical behaviour for executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gramling|first=Larry E. Rittenberg, Karla M. Johnstone, Audrey A.|title=Auditing: a business risk approach|year=2010|publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning|location=Mason, OH|isbn=0324658044|pages=195 and 233|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunn|first=Leonard J.

===Examples of failed tone at the top===

====The Enron scandal====
The [[Enron scandal]], revealed in October 2001, eventually led to the bankruptcy of the [[Enron Corporation]], an American energy company based in [[Houston Texas|Houston, Texas]], and the de facto dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], its audit firm. Enron is considered to be the largest [[bankruptcy]] reorganization in U.S. history, as well as the biggest audit failure.&lt;ref name="DarkSide61"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratton|first=William W.|title=Does Corporate Law Protect the Interests of Shareholders and Other Stakeholders?: Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value|journal=[[Tulane Law Review]]|volume=|issue=1275|page=61|publisher=[[Tulane University Law School]]|location=New Orleans|date=May 2002|ssrn=301475|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executives at Enron used [[Creative accounting|accounting loopholes]], [[special purpose entities]], and misleading [[financial reporting]] to hide billions in debt from failed deals and projects. [[Chief Financial Officer]] [[Andrew Fastow]] and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk [[Standard accounting practice|accounting practices]], but also pressured Andersen to ignore the issues. The Enron story demonstrated many common features of failed tone at the top, including inappropriate hostility to critics and a misunderstanding of public expectations. In a conference call on April 17, 2001, after [[Wall Street]] [[Business analyst|analyst]] [[Richard Grubman]] complained that Enron wasn't releasing a [[balance sheet]] along with its [[financial statements]], then-CEO [[Jeffrey Skilling]] responded "Well, thank you very much, we appreciate that ... asshole," a phrase that was met with dismay and astonishment by the media and public, but which became an inside joke among many Enron employees.&lt;ref name="million"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pasha|first=Shaheen|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/04/10/news/newsmakers/enron_trial/index.htm|publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]]|title=Skilling comes out swinging|date=2006-04-10|accessdate=2010-10-17|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2GOn06|archivedate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WellThankYou"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tolson|first=Mike|author2=Katherine Feser |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/jenny/2404018.html|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|title=Jeff Skilling's spectacular career|date=2004-06-20|accessdate=2010-10-17|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2J4D0c|archivedate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EmpAskWhy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Niles|first=Sam|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/10/ceo-anger-management-ceonetwork-leadership-outbursts_slide_2.html|work=[[Forbes]]|title=In Pictures: 10 All-Time Great CEO Outbursts: Jeffrey Skilling|date=2009-07-10|accessdate=2010-10-17|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2MXiZi|archivedate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arthur Andersen obstruction of justice====
[[Arthur Andersen]] was criticized for being the only [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big 5]] audit firm to allow the partner in charge of an audit to override a ruling made by the quality control partner, and was found guilty in 2002 of obstruction of justice for shredding documents related to its audit of Enron, resulting in the Enron scandal. The Arthur Andersen story is now used in business ethics textbooks as an example of a failure of tone at the top, for emphasizing profitability over high ethical standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunn|first=Leonard J. Brooks, Paul|title=Business &amp; professional ethics for directors, executives, &amp; accountants|year=2010|publisher=South Western Cengage Learning|location=Mason, OH|isbn=0324594550|pages=117–123|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also [[Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States]] and the [[Enron scandal]].''

====Xerox fined by SEC====
In 2002, [[Xerox]] was fined $10 million by the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) for allegedly deceiving the public between 1997 and 2000 by employing several "accounting maneuvers," with six Xerox senior executives paying another $22 million in 2003. The SEC charged that former CEO [[Paul Allaire]] and his second-in-command [[G. Richard Thoman]], who were among the six fined, "set a tone at the top of the company which equated business success with meeting short-term earnings targets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markham|first=Jerry W.|title=A financial history of modern U.S. corporate scandals: from Enron to reform|year=2005|publisher=Sharpe|location=Armonk, N.Y. [u.a.]|isbn=0765615835|pages=224|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scandals at Fannie Mae====
Business experts say that although the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), colloquially known as [[Fannie Mae]], gave the appearance of setting the appropriate tone at the top, its actual conduct fell short. In 2004, Fannie Mae was investigated by the U.S. [[Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight]] (OFHEO), which alleged widespread accounting errors. In 2008 Fannie Mae was embroiled in several conflict of interest scandals, and in 2011 six of its executives, including 2005-2008 Fannie Mae CEO [[Daniel Mudd]], were charged by the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] with [[securities fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cristie|first=James R.

Ego and arrogance was visible everywhere, in everything the company did: how it treated counterparties in the marketplace it dealt in, how it was able to throw its weight around politically, the way it spent money to curry political loyalty, the arrogance that permeated everything that the company did, including ultimately the accounting misconduct, and the lack of any kind of corporate ethics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=John|title=Money for nothing: how the failure of corporate boards is ruining American business and costing us trillions|year=2010|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=1416559930|pages=124–125|edition=1st Free Press hardcover|author2=Zweig, David }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also the [[Fannie Mae#Accounting controversy|2004 Fannie Mae accounting controversy]], the [[Countrywide financial political loan scandal|Countrywide Financial political loan scandal]] and [[Angelo Mozilo#.22Friends of Angelo .28FOA.29.22 VIP program|Friends of Angelo VIP program]], and the [[Fannie Mae#2011 SEC charges|2011 Fannie Mae SEC charges]].''

====[[Tyco International#Corporate scandal of 2002|Tyco Scandal]]====
{{Main|Tyco International#Corporate scandal of 2002}}

Former [[chairman]] and [[chief executive]] [[Dennis Kozlowski]] and former [[chief financial officer]] Mark H. Swartz were accused of the theft of more than $150 million from the company. During their trial in March 2004, they contended the board of directors authorized it as compensation.

During jury deliberations, juror Ruth Jordan, while passing through the courtroom, appeared to make an [[A-ok|"okay" sign]] with her fingers to the defense table. She later denied she had intended that gesture, but the incident received much publicity (including a caricature in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''), and the juror received threats after her name became public. Judge Michael Obus declared a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] on April 2, 2004.

On June 17, 2005, after a retrial, Kozlowski and Swartz were convicted on all but one of the more than 30 counts against them. The verdicts carry potential jail terms of up to 25 years in state prison. Kozlowski himself was sentenced to no less than eight years and four months and no more than 25 years in prison. Swartz received the same sentence. Then in May 2007, [[New Hampshire]] Federal District Court Judge [[Paul Barbadoro]] approved a class action settlement whereby Tyco agreed to pay $2.92 billion (in conjunction with $225 million by [[Pricewaterhouse Coopers]], their auditors) to a class of defrauded shareholders represented by [[Grant &amp; Eisenhofer P.A.]], Schiffrin, Barroway, Topaz &amp; Kessler, and Milberg Weiss &amp; Bershad.

====[[MCI Inc.|MCI Inc/WorldCom]]====
{{Main|MCI_Inc.#Accounting_scandals}}

CEO Bernard Ebbers was accused of accounting fraud.&lt;ref name=sec&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723527/000093176303001862/dex991.htm|title=Report of Investigation by The Special Investigative Committee of the Board of Directors of Worldcom, Inc.|publisher=SEC| accessdate=2008-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebbers had become very wealthy from the rising price of his holdings in WorldCom common stock.&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt; However, in the year 2000, the telecommunications industry entered a downturn &lt;!-- page 33 of Worldcom report --&gt;and WorldCom’s aggressive growth strategy suffered a serious setback when it was forced by the US Justice Department to abandon its proposed merger with Sprint in mid 2000.&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt;  By that time, WorldCom’s stock price was declining and Ebbers came under increasing pressure from banks to cover [[margin call]]s on his WorldCom stock that was used to finance his other businesses (timber and yachting, among others).&lt;ref name=sec /&gt; During 2001, Ebbers persuaded WorldCom’s board of directors to provide him corporate loans and guarantees in excess of $400 million to cover his margin calls.&lt;ref name=sec /&gt; The board hoped that the loans would avert the need for Ebbers to sell substantial amounts of his WorldCom stock, as his doing so would put further downward pressure on the stock's price. However, this strategy ultimately failed and Ebbers was ousted as CEO in April 2002 and replaced by [[John W. Sidgmore|John Sidgmore]], former [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[UUNET]] Technologies, Inc.

Beginning modestly in mid-year 1999 and continuing at an accelerated pace through May 2002, the company (under the direction of Ebbers, [[Scott Sullivan (executive)|Scott Sullivan]] (CFO), David Myers ([[Comptroller]]) and Buford "Buddy" Yates (Director of General Accounting)) used fraudulent accounting methods to mask its declining earnings by painting a false picture of financial growth and profitability to prop up the price of WorldCom’s stock.&lt;ref name=sec /&gt;

The fraud was accomplished primarily in two ways:

#Booking ‘line costs’ (interconnection expenses with other telecommunication companies) as [[capital expenditure|capital]] on the balance sheet instead of [[expense]]s.
#Inflating revenues with bogus accounting entries from "corporate unallocated revenue accounts".

In 2002, a small team of internal auditors at WorldCom worked together, often at night and in secret, to investigate and unearth $3.8 billion in fraud.&lt;ref name=WallStreetJournal&gt;{{cite news |first=Susan |last=Pulliam |author2=Deborah Soloman  |title=How Three Unlikely Sleuths Exposed Fraud at WorldCom: Firm's Own Employees Sniffed Out Cryptic Clues and Followed Hunches |url=http://www.happinessonline.org/MoralCode/LiveWithTruth/p23.htm |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time2002b&gt;{{cite news |first=Amanda |last=Ripley |authorlink=Amanda Ripley |title=The Night Detective |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003990,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=2008-11-08 | date=December 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ExtraCircPatsyLee&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper|first=Cynthia |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Extraordinary Circumstances: The Journey of a Corporate Whistleblower |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0470124296/ref=sib_dp_pt# |accessdate=2008-11-08|series= |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]] |location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]] |isbn=9780470124291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, the company’s audit committee and board of directors were notified of the fraud and acted swiftly:  Sullivan was fired, Myers resigned, [[Arthur Andersen]] withdrew its audit opinion for 2001, and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) launched an investigation into these matters on June 26, 2002 (see [[accounting scandals]]). By the end of 2003, it was estimated that the company's total assets had been inflated by around $11 billion.&lt;ref name=sec /&gt;

====[[ImClone Systems]] trading case====
{{Main|ImClone stock trading case}}

ImClone's stock price dropped sharply at the end of 2001 when its drug [[Cetuximab|Erbitux]], an experimental [[monoclonal antibody]], failed to get the expected [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval. It was later revealed by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] that numerous executives sold their stock before the announcement of the decision after the close of trading on December 28.

Its founder, [[Samuel D. Waksal]], was arrested in 2002 on [[insider trading]] charges for informing friends and family to sell their stock, and attempting to sell his own. His daughter, Aliza Waksal, sold $2.5 million in shares on December 27. His father, Jack Waksal, sold $8.1 million in shares over the 27th and 28th. Company executives had done the same. [[John B. Landes]], the general counsel, sold $2.5 million in shares on December 6. [[Ronald A. Martell]], the vice president for marketing and sales, sold $2.1 million in shares on December 11. Four other executives sold shares in the following weeks as well. Later, Samuel Waksal pleaded guilty to various charges, including [[securities fraud]], and on June 10, 2003, was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3798">'''Vladimir Petrovich Alganov''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Петрович Алганов}}; born 22 October 1952 in [[Leningrad]]) is a Russian spy. He was Soviet [[KGB]] officer in Warsaw, Poland in the 1980s and Russian [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] officer in the same city in the 1990s.

In 1996, Poland's Prime Minister [[Józef Oleksy]] resigned because of his links to Alganov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Polish PM forced to resign over links with KGB man | publisher = The Independent | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/polish-pm-forced-to-resign-over-links-with-kgb-man-1325658.html | date=25 January 1996 | accessdate = 2009-10-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alganov was deported from Poland in 1997.&lt;ref name="stealthroute"/&gt;

In 2005 Lithuanian authorities said that Alganov had been issued a long-term Lithuanian visa in 2002 and Alganov had met managers of the [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Chronicle of Russian Espionage in the Baltic Countries | publisher = Axis Globe | url = http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=49 | date = 2005-04-20 | accessdate = 2009-10-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070914005458/http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=49 | archive-date = 2007-09-14 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Baltic News (2005/01) | publisher = Baltics Worldwide | url = http://www.balticsworldwide.com/baltic-news-200501/ | date=January 2005 | accessdate = 2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Alganov secretly met [[Jan Kulczyk]] in a restaurant in Vienna, Austria. The conversation was recorded by Polish intelligence officers. According to [[Antoni Macierewicz]], a member of the investigative board:
* Alganov offered Kulczyk $5 million to influence Poland's then-President [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]].&lt;ref name="stealthroute"/&gt;
* Alganov said that six months earlier, Russians had paid $1m to the Minister of Finance [[Wiesław Kaczmarek]] for the Russian company [[Lukoil]] to win the privatization tender for a refinery in Gdansk.&lt;ref name="stealthroute"&gt;{{cite news | title = From Poland to Hungary, Gazprom takes stealth route to domination | publisher = The Independent | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/from-poland-to-hungary-gazprom-takes-stealth-route-to-domination-522003.html | date=8 January 2006 | accessdate = 2009-10-17 | location=London | first=Neil | last=Barnett}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Oil scandal rocks Polish leadership - Some fear Moscow gaining influence | publisher = The Boston Globe | url = http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2004/12/05/oil_scandal_rocks_polish_leadership/ | date=2004-12-05 | accessdate = 2009-10-17 | first1=Jeffrey | last1=Fleishman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/moynihan/programs/ces/pcconfpdfs/Kennedy.pdf The cultural politics of military alliances and energy security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317092815/http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/moynihan/programs/ces/pcconfpdfs/Kennedy.pdf |date=2007-03-17 }}.

Tragedy occurs along Canada's "[[Chilko River|White Mile]]," when a canoe capsizes and several of Cutler's companions are swept away by the raging current.

The '''World Counseling System (WCS)''', otherwise called the '''Religious Counseling Standard''', is a classification model developed for use mostly in religious counseling. It is a model commonly used for counseling in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[South America]] and it works on three assumptions:

# That someone is concerned or confused about someone or there is an issue that needs to be resolved, usually urgently.
# That the issue involved is such that it cannot be resolved through the person's own efforts.
# That the inability to resolve the issue without outside assistance necessitates a recourse to a "higher being" who possesses superior wisdom. This higher being is expected to function through earthly agents.

This process involves the engagement of people with [[supernatural]] gifts such as [[prophet]]s (in whatever [[religion]]) and  faith-based counselors to help resolve the problem. The core of the model is that the person with the problem commits his or her case into the hands of the agent of a [[supernatural being]] who is expected to proffer solutions to the problem.

Owing to the involvement of some supernatural being, the issues that can be resolved are unlimited, which makes categorization difficult. Categorization is based, therefore, on the personalities involved in the resolution process, rather than on the problems that need to be solved.

==Classifications==
Under the WCS system, counseling is carried out in three categories:
*Love/Personal relationships
*Business relationships
*Other relationships
  
If someone needs counseling in the area of [[personal relationship]], he or she could seek help from the agents regarding a spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend or [[Engagement|fiancée]]. He or she could ask such questions as "Is my husband faithful?" "Is this person the right person for me to marry?" and "If I marry this person, will the [[marriage]] last?" The online edition requires that you fill out a form. Information you need to supply includes your first name, the full name of the person you need information about, his or her mother's name and your question. When you send in your request, it is sent to at least two counselors. The agency using the WCS service will quickly prepare a composite report (from the two responses) which is sent back to you. The service comes at a fee since the WCS model has a [[copyright]] tied to it. An average response, which is usually more comprehensive than a typical on-line request, can take up to three hours before the reply is available. The response in a typical WCS service may have between 75 and 93 per cent accuracy in its [[prediction]]s regarding the issue to be resolved.

Similar processes apply to the "business" and "other"  categories. For business classification, the question might be something like "I want to embark on this type of [[business]]. Will I succeed?" "Somebody wants to be my partner. Can this person be trusted?" "I want to obtain a [[loan]] from the bank. Will the loan bring profits?" "Will repayment of the loan be difficult?"  The "other relationships" category takes care of areas not covered by personal and business relationships.
