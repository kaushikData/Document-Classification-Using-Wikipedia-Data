      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4290">'''Alcohol exclusion laws''' permit insurance companies to deny claims associated with the consumption of alcohol.  They were passed in the 1940s in the United States to discourage people from drinking alcoholic beverages and to save insurance companies money from alcohol-related  claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ensuringsolutions.org Ensuring Solutions to Alcohol Problems, George Washington University Medical Center, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was believed that people would be less likely to drive while impaired or intoxicated if insurance companies could deny medical payments or other claims associated with any injuries associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages.  Thirty-six states currently allow alcohol exclusions in health care insurance policies via either explicit exclusions or implicit exclusions determines by legal precedence. A growing number of states are overturning their alcohol exclusion laws, currently 14 states plus the District of Columbia prohibit insurance companies from including exclusions for [[alcohol intoxication]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ensuringsolutions.org/resources/resources_show.htm?doc_id=336649&amp;cat_id=986&lt;/ref&gt;

There is to date no scientific evidence that alcohol exclusion laws discourage [[driving under the influence|drunk driving]]. In fact, some argue that these laws discourage physicians and hospitals from testing accident victims for possible alcohol in their blood (BAC). That’s because insurance companies can refuse to pay doctors and hospitals for treating patients found to have alcohol in their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Rivara, Frederick P., ''et al.'' Screening trauma patients for alcohol problems: are insurance companies barriers? ''Journal of  Trauma, Injury, Infection and Critical Care'', 2000, ''48'',  115.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, screening for alcohol could lead to the loss of payments from insurance companies. Because of this, there is concern that alcohol exclusion laws help drunken drivers avoid detection and increase the likelihood that they will repeat their crime in the future.&lt;ref&gt;American Medical Association Advocacy Resource Center. “Supporting Repeal of the Uniform Accident and Sickness Policy Provision Law.” August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cimons, Marlene. ''Challenging a Hidden Obstacle to Alcohol Treatment''. Washington, DC: Ensuring Solutions to Alcohol Problems, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gentilello, L.M., ''et al.'' Alcohol interventions in a [[trauma center]] as a means of reducing the risk of injury recurrence. ''Annals of Surgery'', 1999, ''230(4)'',  473.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine states now prohibit alcohol exclusions and several more are currently considering such action.

The insurance industry supports alcohol exclusion laws. On the other hand,  the professional organization which regulates that industry, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, has voted unanimously to recommend the repeal of alcohol exclusionary laws. Other groups supporting their repeal include the National Conference of Insurance Legislators, the American Bar Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians, [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]], the National Commission Against Drunk Driving, and the American Medical Association.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3211">The '''Allegheny County Alcoholic Beverage Tax''' is a county tax on retail sale of alcoholic beverages within [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]].

The tax, a 10% levy on served alcohol, was passed by the Allegheny County Council and signed into law by [[Dan Onorato]], Allegheny County's Chief Executive on December 4, 2007.&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite web| title = Allegheny County Alcoholic Beverage Tax Official Rules and Regulations| work = www.alleghenycounty.us| publisher = [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]]| date = | url = http://www.alleghenycounty.us/treasure/alcoholtax.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101113041434/http://alleghenycounty.us/treasure/alcoholtax.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 1, 2009, the tax rate was reduced to 7%.&lt;ref name=rules /&gt;  The tax is collected at the [[point of sale]] by restaurants and bars and is collected by Allegheny County Treasurer on a monthly basis.&lt;ref name=rules /&gt; The funds were dedicated to fund the [[Port Authority of Allegheny County]].

An '''arrest warrant''' is a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] issued by a [[judge]] or [[magistrate]] on behalf of the state, which authorizes the [[arrest]] and [[Detention (Imprisonment)|detention]] of an individual, or the search and seizure of an individual's property.

==Canada==
Arrest warrants are issued by a judge or [[justice of the peace]] under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].

Once the warrant has been issued, section 29 of the Code requires that the arresting officer must give notice to the accused of the existence of the warrant, the reason for it, and produce it if requested, if it is feasible to do so.

==Czech Republic== &lt;!-- R to section {{Arrest Warrant in the Czech Republic}} links here --&gt;
[[File:Soudni sin.jpg|thumb|right|In the Czech Republic, the court must immediately hear the arrestee and within 24 hours either order [[Remand (detention)|remand]] or release him or her]]
Czech courts may issue an arrest warrant when it is not achievable to summon or bring in for questioning a charged person and at the same time there is a reason for detention (i.e. concern that the charged person would either flee, interfere with the proceedings or continue criminal activity, see [[Remand in the Czech Republic]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The court must immediately interview the arrested person, who has the right to have an attorney present, unless the attorney is not within reach. The court has 24 hours from the moment of receiving the person from the police to either order [[Remand (detention)|remand]] or to release him.

==Germany==
Detaining a person is only allowed  under certain conditions defined by the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] ({{lang-de|Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}). In article 104 (Deprivation of liberty), the fundamental law determines that
only a ''Haftrichter'' ("arrest judge") may order confinement that exceeds 48 hours. The former is called ''vorläufige Festnahme'' ("provisional confinement"), the latter is named ''Haftbefehl'' ("order of arrest"). Arrest warrants serve the enforcement of the proper expiry for instance in the [[Code of Criminal Procedure]], but also in the civil procedure law and in the administrative law and the special administrative procedures after the Tax Code, the Finance Court order or the social court law.

==United Kingdom==
The procedure for issuing arrest warrants differs in each of the three legal jurisdictions.

===England and Wales===
In [[England &amp; Wales]], arrest warrants can be issued for both suspects and witnesses.

Arrest warrants for suspects can be issued by a [[justice of the peace]] under section 1 of the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] if information (in writing) is laid before them that a person has committed or is suspected of having committed an offence.&lt;ref name="MCA 1980 S1"&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=3208602&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=3208594 section 1 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]. Statutelaw.gov.uk. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Such arrest warrants can only be issued for someone over 18 if at least one of the following is true:&lt;ref name="MCA 1980 S1"/&gt;
* The offence the warrant relates to is an [[indictable offence]], or is punishable with [[imprisonment]].
* The person's address is not sufficiently established to serve a summons there.

Arrest warrants for witnesses can be issued if:
*A justice of the peace is satisfied on oath that:&lt;ref name="MCA 1980 S97"&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=3208594&amp;ActiveTextDocId=3208748 section 97 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]. Statutelaw.gov.uk. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
**Any person in England or Wales is likely to be able to give material evidence, or produce any document or thing likely to be material evidence, at the summary trial of an information by a magistrates' court,
**It is in the interests of justice to issue a summons under this subsection to secure the attendance of that person to give evidence or produce the document or thing, and
**It is probable that a summons would not procure the attendance of the person in question.
*or if:&lt;ref name="MCA 1980 S97"/&gt;
**A person has failed to attend court in response to a summons,
**The court is satisfied by evidence on oath that he is likely to be able to give material evidence or produce any document or thing likely to be material evidence in the proceedings,
**It is proved on oath, or in such other manner as may be prescribed, that he has been duly served with the summons, and that a reasonable sum has been paid or tendered to him for costs and expenses, and
**It appears to the court that there is no just excuse for the failure.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, a ''Warrant to Apprehend'' may be issued if a defendant fails to appear in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/46/section/102A?view=plain|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Ireland===
In [[Northern Ireland]] arrest warrants are usually issued by a [[magistrate]].

==United States==
{{Template:Law enforcement in the United States}}
For the police to make a lawful arrest, the arresting officer(s) must have either (1) probable cause to arrest, or (2) a valid arrest warrant.

A valid arrest warrant must be issued by a neutral judge or magistrate, who has determined there is [[probable cause]] for an arrest, based upon sworn testimony or an affidavit in support of the petition for a warrant.&lt;ref name="gard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gard|first1=Stephen W.|title=Bearing False Witness: Perjured Affidavits and the Fourth Amendment|journal=Suffolk University Law Review|date=2008|volume=41|issue=3|page=452|url=http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1632&amp;context=fac_articles|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest warrant must specifically identify the person to be arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Jeffrey A.|title=The American Courts: a Procedural Approach|date=2011|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, Massachusetts|isbn=0763755281|page=287|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvT5SVwbakUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a law enforcement affiant provides false information or shows reckless disregard for the truth when providing an affidavit or testimony in support of an arrest warrant, that may constitute grounds to invalidate the warrant.&lt;ref name="gard"/&gt;

These minimum requirements stem from the language contained in the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].  Federal statute and most jurisdictions mandate the issuance of an arrest warrant for the arrest of individuals for most [[misdemeanors]] that were not committed within the view of a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Warrantless Arrests, Policy 501.4|url=http://www.flpd.org/home/showdocument?id=4157|website=Fort Lauderdale Police Department|accessdate=13 August 2017|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as long as police have the necessary [[probable cause]], a warrant is usually not needed to arrest someone suspected of a [[felony]] in a public place; these laws vary from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virginia v. Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 128 S.Ct. 1598 (2008)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1093900464900723958|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a non-emergency situation, an arrest of an individual in their home requires an arrest warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search &amp; Seizure Field Guide|url=https://www.aclu.org/files/FilesPDFs/ALPR/oregon/Washington%20County%20Sheriff%27s%20Office/30012-30050%20Search%20and%20Seizure%20Field%20Guide.pdf|website=ACLU|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adequate showing of probable cause===

Probable cause can be based on either direct observation by the police officer, or on hearsay information provided by others. Information the police bring to the neutral and detached magistrate must establish that—considering the police officer's experience and training—the officer knows facts, either through personal observation or through hearsay, that would suggest to a [[Reasonable person|reasonable, prudent person]] that the individual named in the warrant committed or was committing a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hearsay Evidence as a Basis for Prosecution, Arrest and Search|journal=Indiana Law Journal|date=Spring 1957|volume=32|issue=3|url=http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2796&amp;context=ilj|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1964 to 1983, a constitutionally adequate affidavit comprised exclusively or primarily of hearsay information had to have contained information suggesting to the examining magistrate that (1) the hearsay declarant supplying the information to the police was a credible person, and (2) that the hearsay declarant had a strong basis of knowledge for the alleged facts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aguilar v. Texas|Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1983, a constitutionally sufficient affidavit must support a conclusion by a reviewing magistrate that the "[[totality of the circumstances]]" suggest that there is a fair probability that the facts the police relied on for probable cause to arrest are valid; the magistrate balances “the relative weights of all the various indicia of reliability (and unreliability) attending an informant's tip.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Illinois v. Gates|Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutral and detached magistrate===

The individual issuing the arrest warrant need not be a judge or an attorney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Abraham S.|title=The Search Warrant, The Magistrate, and Judicial Review|journal=New York University Law Review|date=1987|volume=62|issue=6|page=1173|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/nylr62&amp;div=47&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but must be both capable of determining whether probable cause exists as well as be a neutral and detached official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jones v. United States, 333 US 10 (1948).|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12095002551234782978|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While arrest warrants are typically issued by [[court]]s, they may also be issued by one of the chambers of the [[United States Congress]] or other [[legislature]]s (via the [[call of the house]] [[motion (democracy)|motion]]) and other political entities.

===No known or reckless falsehoods===

A warrant is invalid if the defendant challenging the arrest warrant can show, by a [[preponderance of the evidence]], that: 
* Specific parts of the affidavit the police submitted are false.
* The police either knowingly falsified them or made them with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsity.
* Excluding the false statements, the remainder of the affidavit would not have established probable cause to arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franks v. Delaware|Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description of arrestee===

The arrest warrant must, to comply with the Fourth Amendment, "particularly describe" the person to be seized. If the arrest warrant does not contain such a description, it is invalid—even if the affidavit submitted by the police or the warrant application contained this requisite information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-811.ZO.html Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mittimus===
A mittimus is a [[writ]] issued by a [[court]] or [[magistrate]], directing the [[sheriff]] or other executive officer to convey the person named in the writ to a prison or [[County jail|jail]], and directing the jailor to receive and imprison the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=K.W.|title=Is There a Constitutional Right to a Speedy Probable Cause Hearing?|journal=New England Journal on Crime and Civil Confinement|date=Winter 1990|volume=16|issue=1|pages=121-139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the usage of this word is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... Thomas Fraser, Gregor Van Iveren and John Schaver having some time since been Confirmed by the Committee of the County of Albany for being Persons disaffected to the Cause of America and whose going at large may be dangerous to the State, Ordered Thereupon that a Mittimus be made out to keep them confined till such time as they be discharged by the Board or any other three of the Commissioners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Minutes of the Commissioners for detecting and defeating Conspiracies in the State of New York, Albany County Sessions,1778–1781|date=1909|publisher=Albany County|location=Albany, New York|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In police jargon, these writs are sometimes referred to as a [[Capias ad respondendum|writ of capias]], defined as orders to "take" a person or assets. Capias writs are often issued when a suspect fails to appear for a scheduled adjudication, hearing, or similar proceeding.

=== {{Visible anchor|Bench warrant}} ===&lt;!-- Other articles link here. --&gt;
A bench warrant is a summons issued from "the bench" (a judge or court) directing the police to arrest someone who must be brought before a specific judge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Court Terms|publisher=Maryland Courts|url=http://www.courts.state.md.us/reference/glossary.html|access-date=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; either for [[contempt of court]] or for failing to appear in court as required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What to Do if You Face a Bench Warrant|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-do-if-you-face-bench-warrant|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|access-date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a basic arrest warrant, a bench warrant is not issued to initiate the first criminal action.&lt;ref name=SCJD&gt;{{cite web|title=Warrants|publisher=South Carolina Judicial Department|url=http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/summaryCourtBenchBook/HTML/CriminalC.htm|access-date=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a defendant is released on bail or under recognizance and misses a scheduled court appearance, or if a witness whose testimony is required in court does not appear as required by a subpoena, a bench warrant may be issued for that person's arrest.&lt;ref name="brevard"&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=FAQ's|url=http://brevardclerk.us/faq-s|website=Clerk of the Court|publisher=Brevard County, Florida|access-date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where a bench warrant is issued to arrest people who posted [[bail]] and subsequently missed their court dates, usually after they are rearrested and brought before the judge, the judge may raise the bail amount or revoke it completely.&lt;ref name="brevard" /&gt;

If a law enforcement officer stops an individual with an outstanding bench warrant against him, the person may be detained on the warrant, and may be held in jail until a bond is posted or a hearing is held on the warrant. The hearing may result in the court setting a new bail amount, new conditions, and a new court appearance date.&lt;ref name="brevard" /&gt; If a criminal defendant is arrested on a bench warrant, the court may determine that the person is a flight risk (likely to flee the jurisdiction) and order that person held without bail.&lt;ref name="brevard" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mamalian|first1=Cynthia A.|title=State of the Science of Pretrial Risk Assessment|url=http://www.pacenterofexcellence.pitt.edu/documents/PJI_State_of_the_Science_Pretrial_Risk_Assessment_(2011).pdf|website=Pennsylvania Mental Health and Justice Center of Excellence|access-date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outstanding arrest warrant===
An arrest warrant is an ''outstanding arrest warrant'' when the person named in the warrant has not yet been arrested. A warrant may be outstanding if the person named in the warrant is [[fugitive|intentionally evading law enforcement]], unaware that there is a warrant out for his or her arrest, the agency responsible for executing the warrant has a backlog of warrants to serve, or a combination of these factors.

Some jurisdictions have a very high number of outstanding warrants. The vast majority in such American jurisdictions are for traffic related (non-violent) citations. The U.S. state of [[California]] in 1999 had around 2.5 million outstanding warrants, with nearly 1 million of them in the [[Los Angeles]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1999/06/22/MN09FRO.DTL&amp;type=chart When Justice Goes Unserved / Thousands wanted on outstanding warrants – but law enforcement largely ignores them]. Sfgate.com (22 June 1999). Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] had 100,000 as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matt Zapotosky, The Washington Post |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-01-19/news/bs-md-prince-georges-homicides-20110119_1_killings-criminal-homicides-slaying/2 |title=Verlyncia Coleman &amp;#124; Prince George's police close 4 of year's 12 homicides |publisher=Baltimore Sun |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] has 49,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014135720/http://www.bestofneworleans.com/dispatch/2003-12-09/cover_story2.html Countless Fugitives], Gambit Communications, Inc., 12 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Some places have laws placing various restrictions on persons with outstanding warrants, such as prohibiting renewal of one's [[driver's license]] or obtaining a [[passport]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8323">'''Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom''' is divided into separate local regimes for England and Wales, for Northern Ireland, and for Scotland. There is also a [[United Kingdom insolvency law|UK insolvency law]] which applies across the United Kingdom, since [[bankruptcy]] refers only to [[insolvency]] of individuals and partnerships. Other procedures, for example [[administration (law)|administration]] and [[liquidation]], apply to insolvent companies. However, the term 'bankruptcy' is often used when referring to insolvent companies in the general media.

==Bankruptcy in England and Wales==
In England and Wales, bankruptcy is governed by Part IX of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] (as amended) and by the Insolvency Rules 1986 (as amended). The term bankruptcy applies only to individuals, not to companies or other legal entities.

An individual may be made bankrupt only by court order following the presentation of a bankruptcy petition. An individual may present his own petition on the ground that he is insolvent, i.e. unable to pay his debts. A creditor or creditors may also petition for a bankruptcy order to be made against an individual debtor.

Before a creditor presents a bankruptcy petition he must usually first serve on the debtor a statutory demand in one of the prescribed forms&lt;ref&gt;Such forms are provided at &lt;https://www.gov.uk/statutory-demands/overview&gt;, accessed 2014-Oct-22.&lt;/ref&gt; requiring the debtor to pay the sum claimed within 21 days of service of the demand. The debtor may apply to the court to set aside the demand on the basis that the debt is disputed on bona fide grounds or that he has a counterclaim, set off or cross-demand which equals or exceeds the amount of the debt claimed by the creditor. If the debtor fails to pay the sum claimed in the demand or to apply to set aside the demand or if his application to set aside the demand is dismissed by the court, the creditor may present a bankruptcy petition. Alternatively, a creditor may petition without first serving a demand if execution on a judgment has failed. In either case the debtor must owe the creditor at least £5000 and the claim must be for a liquidated sum, i.e. a fixed sum of money (not, for example, damages).

A bankruptcy petition must generally be served on the debtor personally, but if the creditor is unable to effect service, either because the debtor has evaded service or cannot be traced, the court may order substituted service, i.e. service by post or some other method which is likely to bring the demand to the debtor's attention.

At the hearing of the petition the court may make a bankruptcy order if the debt is undisputed or not capable of being disputed, dismiss the petition (for example if the debt has been paid) or adjourn the petition to give the debtor time to pay.

If a bankruptcy order is made the administration of the bankrupt person's affairs is handled by a trustee in bankruptcy who must be either the [[Official Receiver]] (a civil servant) or a licensed insolvency practitioner appointed either by the Secretary of State or by the creditors at a meeting called for that purpose. The bankrupt's assets (excluding tools of his trade and other essentials) vest in his trustee who is obliged to realise them (generally by selling them) to pay a dividend to creditors.

A bankrupt person is subject to certain restrictions, principally that he may not raise credit without informing the person from whom he is borrowing that he is a bankrupt, and that he may not act as a director of a company. He is also subject to obligations to give information to his trustee and to cooperate with him in the administration of his affairs. Extensive powers are available to enable the court to compel the bankrupt to do so. Similarly the court has power to undo a range of transactions entered into by the bankrupt with a view to dissipating or reducing the value of his assets in the period before his bankruptcy.

Following the coming into force of the [[Enterprise Act 2002]]'s bankruptcy provisions in April 2004, an England &amp; Wales bankruptcy will now normally last no longer than 12 months and maybe fewer, if the Official Receiver files in Court a certificate that his investigations are complete. At the end of that period the bankrupt is discharged and he ceases to be liable for his bankruptcy debts. However, in cases where the bankrupt is considered culpable for his or her insolvency, a bankruptcy restrictions order may be made to extend some of the restrictions of bankruptcy for up to 15 years.

As an alternative to bankruptcy a debtor may propose an [[Individual Voluntary Arrangement]] (IVA) to his creditors (see Part VIII of the Insolvency Act 1986) or a [[Debt Relief Order]] if debts do not exceed a certain threshold. An IVA takes the form of a proposal to creditors to pay some or all of the debtor's debts over a period of time by selling assets or making payment out of income or a combination of the two. The proposal must be approved by a licensed insolvency practitioner who will convene a meeting of creditors to consider it. Approval requires a majority vote in value in excess of 75%. If the proposal is approved it binds all the debtor's creditors whether or not they have voted in favour of it.

In theory it is also open to a debtor to make a proposal to his creditors by deed of arrangement under the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914, but this procedure has fallen into disuse since the introduction of voluntary arrangements under the Insolvency Act 1986.

Bankruptcy in [[Scotland]] is called '''Sequestration'''&lt;ref&gt;Grier WS, Nicholas, "Bankruptcy in Scotland: Past, Present, and Future", Scottish Parliamentary Review, Vol. I, No. 2 (Jan, 2014) [Edinburgh: Blacket Avenue Press]&lt;/ref&gt; and the organisation responsible for administering these processes is the [[Accountant in Bankruptcy]]. There are alternatives to bankruptcy that can help individuals deal with debt problems, these include the Debt Arrangement Scheme. Other options include [[Trust Deeds]], these are types of agreement arranged between the individual in debt and his or her creditors. There are organisations that give free professional advice to individuals experiencing problems with debt, these include [[Citizens Advice Scotland]].

The [[Pakistan Penal Code]], the main judicial law of Pakistan, prohibits [[blasphemy]] ({{lang-ur|قانون توہین رسالت}}) against any recognized religion, providing penalties ranging from a fine to death. From 1967 to 2014, over 1,300 people have been accused of blasphemy, Muslims constitute the majority of those booked under these laws.&lt;ref name=bbc-blasphem/&gt;

==Constitution==
By its constitution, the official name of [[Pakistan]] is the "Islamic Republic of Pakistan" as of 1956. More than 96% of Pakistan's 167 million citizens (2008) are Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Committee on Elimination of Racial Discrimination considers report of Pakistan | work = Press Release | publisher = United Nations | date = 20 February 2009 | url = http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/91CEF59BA2FEB79FC125756300751700?opendocument | accessdate =27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among [[List of Muslim-majority countries|countries with a Muslim majority]], Pakistan has the strictest anti-blasphemy laws. The first purpose of those laws is to protect Islamic authority. By the constitution (Article 2), Islam is the [[state religion]]. By the constitution's Article 31, it is the country's duty to foster the Islamic way of life. By Article 33, it is the country's duty to discourage parochial, racial, tribal, sectarian, and provincial prejudices among the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part1.html|title=Part I: "Introductory"|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 10A of constitution it is also the state's duty to provide for the right of fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html#18|title=Chapter 1: "Fundamental Rights" of Part II: "Fundamental Rights and Principles of Policy"|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
Religion-related offences on the territory of modern Pakistan were first codified by the [[British Raj]] in 1860, and were expanded in 1927.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12621225 |title=What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws?|publisher=BBC|accessdate =2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan inherited that legislation when it gained independence after the [[partition of India]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Several sections of Pakistan's Penal Code comprise its [[blasphemy law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html|title=Pakistan Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860)|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for §&amp;nbsp;295-C, the provisions of §&amp;nbsp;295 require that an offence be a consequence of the accused's intent. 
(See below [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan#Sharia|Sharia]].)

§&amp;nbsp;298 states:

:Whoever, with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person, utters any word or makes any sound in the hearing of that person or makes any gesture in the sight of that person or places any object in the sight of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.

The only law that may be useful in countering misuse of the blasphemy law is PPC 153 A (a), whoever "by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representations or otherwise, promotes or incites, or attempts to promote or incite, on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste or community or any other ground whatsoever, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities" shall be fined and punished with imprisonment for a term that may extend to five years.

On 12 January 2011, Prime Minister of Pakistan Yousuf Raza Gilani once again said that there would be no amendments to the blasphemy law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Sharia==
The [[Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan|Federal Shariat Court]] (FSC) is a religious body which rules on whether any particular law is repugnant to the injunctions of Islam. If a law is repugnant to Islam, "the President in the case of a law with respect to a matter in the Federal Legislative List or the Concurrent Legislative List, or the Governor in the case of a law with respect to a matter not enumerated in either of those Lists, shall take steps to amend the law so as to bring such law or provision into conformity with the Injunctions of Islam" (Constitution, Article 203D). In October 1990, the FSC ruled that §&amp;nbsp;295-C was repugnant to Islam by permitting life imprisonment as an alternative to a death sentence. The Court said "the penalty for contempt of the Holy Prophet ... is death."&lt;ref name="FreedomNow"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.freedom-now.org/masih_pet.php | title = Petition To: United Nations Working Group On Arbitrary Detention – in the Matter of Ayub Masih, Citizen of Pakistan v.

Promptly after the FSC's ruling in 1990, Bishop Dani L. Tasleem filed an appeal in the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which has the power to overrule the FSC. In April 2009, the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court considered the appeal. Deputy Attorney-General Agha Tariq Mehmood, who represented the federal government, said that the Shariat Appellate Bench dismissed the appeal because the appellant did not pursue it. The appellant did not present any argument on the appeal because the appellant, according to reports, was no longer alive. Consequently, it appears to be the law in Pakistan that persons convicted under §&amp;nbsp;295-C must be sentenced to death with or without a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Pak SC rejects petition-challenging death as the only punishment for blasphemy | publisher = PakistanNews.net | date = 22 April 2009 | url = http://www.pakistannews.net/story/492878 | accessdate = 28 June 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724001257/http://www.pakistannews.net/story/492878 | archivedate = 24 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations==
Pakistan's support of blasphemy laws has caused it to be active in the international arena in promoting global limitations on freedom of religion or belief and limitations on freedom of expression. In March 2009, Pakistan presented a resolution to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in Geneva which calls upon the world to formulate laws against the defamation of religion.&lt;ref name="Pak2009"/&gt; See [[Blasphemy#Blasphemy and the United Nations|blasphemy]].

On 19 March 2014, [[The Nation (Pakistan)|''The Nation'']] polled its readers and later reported that 68% of Pakistanis believe the blasphemy law should be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/E-Paper/lahore/2014-03-19/page-7|title=ePaper &amp; Archives – The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the [[International Crisis Group]] reports that &lt;blockquote&gt;... the Islamic parties are most successful in galvanising street power when the goal is narrowly linked to obstructing reforms to discriminatory religious laws that often provoke sectarian violence and conflict and undermine the rule of law and constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=ICG&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic Parties in Pakistan Crisis Group Asia Report N°216,|date=12 December 2011|publisher=International Crisis Group|page=26|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/files/asia/south-asia/pakistan/216%20islamic%20parties%20in%20pakistan.pdf|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pakistani human rights activists say that because there is no punishment for making a false accusation, charges of blasphemy are being used to harass minorities and settle personal conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2014/09/11/347594972/activists-worry-pakistans-blasphemy-law-is-being-abused Activists Worry Pakistan's Blasphemy Law Is Being Abused]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected cases==

Arrests and death sentences issued for blasphemy laws in Pakistan go back to the late 1980s and early 90s. Despite the implementation of these laws, no one has yet been executed by the order of the courts or governments as to date, only imprisoned to await a verdict or killed at the hands of felons who were convinced that the suspects were guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religionnews.com/2013/09/24/pakistans-blasphemy-laws-require-death-sentence-false-accusers/|title=Pakistan’s blasphemy laws to require death sentence for false accusers|first=Richard S.|last=Ehrlich|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/increasing-violence-in-pakistan-surrounding-blasphemy-cases-deters-opposition-1399587606|title=Increasing Violence in Pakistan Surrounding Blasphemy Cases Deters Opposition|first=Annabel|last=Symington|date=9 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In January, 2014 Muhammad Asghar, a 70-year-old British man from [[Edinburgh]], was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to death by a court in [[Rawalpindi]]. Asghar had initially been arrested in 2010 after sending letters in which he declared himself a prophet, and had lived in Pakistan for several years prior to his arrest and trial. Javed Gul, a government prosecutor, disclosed to Agence France Presse that, "Asghar claimed to be a prophet even inside the court. He confessed it in front of the judge." Asghar's lawyers had argued during the trial that he should be granted leniency on account of a history of mental illness, but a medical panel later rejected this argument after reviewing his case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* In November 2010, [[Asia Bibi]] was sentenced to death by hanging on a charge of blasphemy. She said the accusation was false and was simply revenge after an argument in a berry field over drinking water. The case has sparked international reactions, and {{as of|2015|lc=y}} is still being appealed. Punjab Governor [[Salman Taseer]] was shot dead by his security guard for supporting [[Asia Bibi]]. Salman Taseer had visited Bibi in Jail and had held a press conference with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7L18cmAf6k|title=YouTube|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had told media that she would be released soon and the President of Pakistan will soon annul her death sentence.

* On 22 January 2009, Hector Aleem a Christian Human Rights Activist in Pakistan was arrested on a blasphemy charge. According to the FIR, someone sent a blasphemous text message to the leader of Sunni Tehreek. Hector Aleem was arrested because the sender had once contacted him. Hector Aleem, the Chairman of Peace Worldwide, had been working for a church in Islamabad which was demolished by the CDA (Capital Development Authority) for having been built illegally. When Hector Aleem objected to the destruction of the church he was faced with several threats and lawsuits ranging from fraud to criminal charges. He fought all of them in the courts and proved his innocence. He also faced several assassination attempts. Hector Aleem was eventually arrested on the charge of blasphemy.
* In February 2008, Special Rapporteurs of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] reminded Pakistan's representative of the matter regarding Raja Fiaz, Muhammad Bilal, Nazar Zakir Hussain, Qazi Farooq, Muhammad Rafique, Muhammad Saddique and Ghulam Hussain. According to the allegations received, the men were members of the [[Mehdi Foundation International]] (MFI), a multi-faith institution utilising the name of [[Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi]]. They were arrested on 23 December 2005 in Wapda Town. The police confiscated posters on which [[Gohar Shahi]] was shown as "Imam Mehdi." On 13 July 2006, the Anti-Terrorism Court No. 1 in Lahore sentenced each accused to five years of imprisonment, ''inter alia'', under § 295-A for having outraged others' religious feelings. Since 27 August 2006, the seven men have been detained in Sahiwal Jail, Punjab, where they were forced to parade naked, and were suspended from the ceiling and beaten. For this reason, they were constantly threatened and intimidated by prison staff as well as by other detainees.
* Christians and Muslims in Pakistan condemned [[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' as blasphemous. On 3 June 2006, Pakistan banned the [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film]].

* In October 2000, Pakistani authorities charged M. [[Younus Shaikh]], a physician, with blasphemy on account of remarks that students claimed he made during a lecture.

* The police arrested Ayub Masih, a Pakistani Christian bricklayer for blasphemy on 14 October 1996 and jailed him for violation of §&amp;nbsp;295-C. Muhammad Akram, a Muslim neighbour to Masih, complained to the police that Masih had said Christianity was right, and Masih had recommended that Akram read [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''Satanic Verses''.&lt;ref name="FreedomNow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICC2002"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Blasphemy Prisoner Acquitted After Six Years in Prison | publisher = International Christian Concern | date = 16 August 2002 | url = http://persecution.org/news/Press_Releases/PR_2002/press2002-08-15.html | accessdate = 27 June 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20040804090342/http://persecution.org/news/Press_Releases/PR_2002/press2002-08-15.html | archivedate = 4 August 2004 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day that Masih was arrested, Muslim villagers forced the entire Christian population of Masih's village (fourteen families) to leave the village. Masih's family had applied under a government program that gave housing plots to landless people. Local landlords resented Masih's application because the landlords had been able to oblige landless Christians to work in the fields in exchange for a place to live. Masih's application gave him a way out of his subservience to the landlords.&lt;ref name="WPost"/&gt; Upon Masih's arrest, the authorities gave Masih's plot to Akram.&lt;ref name="FreedomNow"/&gt; Akram shot and injured Masih in the halls of the Session Court at Sahiwal on 6 November 1997. Four assailants attacked Masih in jail. The authorities took no action against Akram or against the other assailants.&lt;ref name="FreedomNow"/&gt; On 20 April 1998, Judge Abdul Khan sentenced Masih to death and levied a fine of 100,000 rupees. Two judges of the Lahore High Court heard Masih's appeal on 24 July 2001. Shortly thereafter, the judges affirmed the judgment of the trial court.&lt;ref name="FreedomNow"/&gt; On 16 August 2002, the Supreme Court of Pakistan set aside the judgment of the lower courts. The Supreme Court noted Akram's acquisition of Masih's property and concluded the case had been fabricated for personal gain. The court also noted other breaches in the law of due process.&lt;ref name="Persecution"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://persecution.org/news/Press_Releases/PR_2002/press2002-08-15.html | title = Blasphemy Prisoner Acquitted After Six Years in Prison | date = 15 August 2002 | publisher = International Christian Concern | accessdate = 26 June 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20040804090342/http://persecution.org/news/Press_Releases/PR_2002/press2002-08-15.html | archivedate = 4 August 2004 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Olsen | first = Ted | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/augustweb-only/8-12-51.0.html| title = Pakistan frees Christian prisoner as country mourns attacks | date = 8 August 2002 | publisher = Christianity Today Magazine |  accessdate =26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In November 2016, a Facebook campaign was launched by the followers of [[Khadim Hussain Rizvi]], against Malik Shahrukh, a Ph.D. researcher who was previously associated with an Islamabad-based diplomatic news publication. Malik was accused of calling the Quran "''an ordinary book, produced by [[Mohammad]] for economic and political purposes.''" A video of the local Imam of [[Sargodha]], in which he incited people during the Friday sermon to kill Malik, went viral. Several applications were made to the authorities against Malik, demanding that he be sentenced to death. Authorities could not arrest Malik because he was not in Pakistan at the time. Sources claim that Malik is being framed for criticizing [[Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan|Tahreek-e-Labbaik]] and its chief.

==History==
In the 1930s, radio was coming to prominence as a source of musical entertainment that threatened to weaken record sales and opportunities for "live" acts. The Great Depression was already draining artist revenues from recordings and live performances. [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]], the pre-eminent royalty/licensing agency for more than two decades, required radio stations to subscribe to "blanket" licenses granting ASCAP a fixed percentage of each station's revenue, regardless of how much music the station played from ASCAP's repertoire.  In 1939, ASCAP announced a substantial increase in the revenue share licensees would be required to pay. BMI was founded by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] to provide a lower-cost alternative to ASCAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = NAB Creates $1,500,000 Music Project | last = Taishoff | first = Sol | work = Broadcasting | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | date = September 15, 1939 | page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, BMI created competition in the field of performing rights, providing an alternative source of licensing for all music users.

The vast majority of U.S. radio stations and all three radio networks refused to renew their ASCAP licenses for 1941, choosing to forgo playing ASCAP music entirely and relying on the BMI repertoire. In February 1941, BMI and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] entered into a consent decree, requiring certain changes to BMI's business model, including giving licensees the option of paying only for the music they actually use instead of buying a blanket license.&lt;ref&gt;The dispute between ASCAP and the radio industry is the subject of major articles in every issue of ''Broadcasting'' from mid-1939 through early 1941.  The text of the consent decree is published in the February 3, 1941, issue, beginning on page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. District Court in Milwaukee was chosen by the Justice Department to supervise the decree for both BMI and ASCAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | work = Broadcasting | date = March 24, 1941 | title = Milwaukee Preferred: Waters Preference for Damm Led to Selection | page = 40 | volume = 20 | issue = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Competing against the strongly established ASCAP, BMI sought out artists that ASCAP tended to overlook or ignore. BMI also purchased the rights to numerous catalogs held by independent publishers or whose ASCAP contracts were about to expire.  To attract newer writers, BMI proposed to compensate songwriters and publishers on the basis of a fixed fee per performance, as opposed to ASCAP's two-tier system which discriminated against less-established songwriters.  Thus, despite its original motivation regarding radio station royalties and its focus on radio station revenues vs artist revenues, BMI became the first performing rights organization in the United States to represent songwriters of [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]] (black genres, performers, and writers that ASCAP did not want to represent), [[country music|country]], [[traditional music|folk]], [[Latin American music|Latin]], and—ultimately—[[rock and roll]]. During the 1940s and 1950s, BMI was the primary licensing organization for Country artists and R&amp;B artists, while ASCAP centered on more established Pop artists. Also during this time, BMI expanded its repertoire of [[classical music]], and now represents the majority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BMI Members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters|url=http://www.bmi.com/genres/entry/bmi_members_american_academy_of_arts_and_letters|website=BMI|publisher=BMI|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the members of the prestigious [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and the winners of 31&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BMI Pulitzer Prize Winners |url=http://www.bmi.com/genres/entry/bmi_pulitzer_prize_winners|website=BMI|publisher=BMI|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pulitzer Prize for Music|Pulitzer Prizes for Music]]. In July 2017, BMI renewed long-term partnership with C3 Presents, world's largest music festival producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicconnection.com/bmi-c3-presents-sign-long-term-agreement/|title=BMI and C3 Presents Sign Long-Term Partnership Agreement|website=www.musicconnection.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BMI's practice of selling only "blanket licenses", rather than licenses for individual artists, led to a major [[antitrust law]] dispute between BMI and [[CBS]] that resulted in the 1979 case ''[[Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, Inc.]]'', in which the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held that the [[Sherman Act]]{{'s}} prohibition of "price fixing" was not strictly literal, and should be interpreted in light of economic efficiencies an agreement brings.

==Business==
BMI issues licenses to users of music, including:
* Television and radio stations and networks
* New media, including the Internet and mobile technologies such as [[podcast]]s, [[ringtone]]s, and [[ringback tone|ringbacks]]
* Satellite audio services, such as [[XM]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]]
* Nightclubs, discos, hotels, bars, and restaurants
* Symphony orchestras, concert bands, and classical [[chamber music]] ensembles
* Digital [[jukebox]]es
* Live concerts

BMI tracks public performances for more than 13 million works, and collects and distributes licensing revenues for those performances as royalties to over 800,000 songwriters, composers, and music publishers it represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bmi.com/about|title=About {{!}} BMI.com|work=BMI.com|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BMI has offices in Atlanta, London, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York, and Puerto Rico.

==Awards==
{{main|BMI Award}}

[[Image:Vitnemaal candjur.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Diploma from the [[University of Oslo]]]]
'''Candidate of Law''' ({{lang-la|candidatus/candidata juris}}, {{lang-da|cand.jur.}}, {{lang-no|cand.jur.}}, {{lang-sv|jur.kand}}, {{lang-fi|oik. maist.}}) is the degree awarded to jurists who have passed the law exam in [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] after studying law for about 5–6 years. In [[Iceland]], graduates are now awarded a master's degree in the field of law.

==Sweden==
The Swedish ''jur.kand'' is obtained after four and a half years at the normal pace. Danish, Icelandic and Finnish degrees take five years. In Norway, the degree is obtained after five and a half years, in addition to a compulsory single term entrance examination in philosophy and ethics, the [[Examen Philosophicum]] – a total of 6 years. In Norway it was replaced by the degree [[Master of Laws]] in 2003; the final student to graduate as a cand.jur did so in the spring term of 2007. Swedish universities switched to a curriculum leading up to a Master of Law rather than a jur.kand in the fall of 2010.

==Finland==
Previously in Finland the academic degree ({{lang-fi|oikeustieteen kandidaatti}}, {{lang-sv|juris kandidat}}) was awarded to a person after completing generally 5 years of study in the field of law. Both before and after the Bologna process in 2005 the academic degree is split into two different grades. Previously, the lower degree was ''varanotaari'' (Fi.) / ''vicenotarie'' (Sw.), and currently the lower degree awarded is ''oikeusnotaari'' (Fi.) / ''rättsnotarie'' (Sw.) after completing circa 3 years of study (180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits) equal to LL.B. The upper degree is ''oikeustieteen maisteri'' (Fi.) / ''juris magister'' (Sw.) after additional 2 years of study (120 ECTS) equal to an LL.M. or JD.

The right to practice specific law-related occupations (e.g. judge, prosecutor, lawyer) in Finland is awarded by completing either the old exam ''oikeustieteen kandidaatti'' / ''juris kandidat'' (before 2005) or the new exam ''oikeustieteen maisteri'' / ''juris magister'' (after 2005). The ''oikeusnotaari''/''rättsnotarie'' degree alone doesn't give the right to practice law-related occupations.

==Norway==
The cand. jur. education used to be the qualifying legal education in Norway usually completed in 6 years full-time. As a result of an extensive reform of the Norwegian educational system, the cand. jur. program was replaced with the Master of Laws-degree. The Master of Laws is standardized to 5 years, based on the standard length of a bachelor+master education of 5 years.

The final cand. jur. degree was awarded in the Spring of 2007.
 
Traditionally, the student must swear an oath to avoid straying from truth and justice, nor encouraging needless dispute. The oath is no longer spoken, but it is implied with a handshake during the graduation ceremony.

==Common==
In Scandinavian countries, the exam can only be taken at a university with a [[diploma privilege]] granted by the government – though any institution may provide legal education. University education was until recently based on large scale seminars rather than classroom education, thus several private institutions were established in the 1980s and 1990s in order to assist lawstudents.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The competition for a study right in law at university is very fierce in all Nordic countries.  There are usually more than 10 applicants for one place at the Law faculties. The admission system however vary from every country.

==Comparability==
The degree is roughly equal to the ''[[Master of Laws]] (LLM)'' in [[Europe]] but a step above the ''[[Juris Doctor]] (JD)'' the [[United States]] which would be the equivalent of a LL.B .

The '''Chancellor of Justice''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''oikeuskansleri'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''justitiekanslern'') is a [[Finland|Finnish]] government official who supervises authorities', such as cabinet ministers', compliance with the law and advances legal protection of Finnish citizens. The Chancellor investigates complaints against authorities' activities and may also start an investigation of his or her own initiative. The Chancellor attends cabinet meetings to ensure that legal procedures and regulations are followed. The Chancellor has wide-ranging oversight, investigative and prosecutorial powers.

The Chancellor and his deputy are appointed by the [[President of Finland]]. The Chancellor is appointed for life.

The incumbent Chancellor of Justice is [[Tuomas Pöysti]].

==History==
The Office of the Chancellor of Justice dates back to the 18th century, when Finland was part of the [[Kingdom of Sweden]]. When Finland was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1809 as an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]], the legal system largely remained the same. The duties of the Chancellor of Justice were given to the Procurator, who assisted the [[Governor-General of Finland|Governor-General]] in supervising obedience of the law.

A year after Finland had [[Finland's declaration of independence|declared its independence]] in 1917, the title was reverted to Chancellor of Justice. The first Chancellor of Justice was [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]], who had served as the [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|Speaker of the Parliament]] and who was later to become the third [[President of Finland]]. In 1919, the post of [[Parliamentary Ombudsman]] was created. The Ombudsman and the Chancellor of Justice share many duties.

==Duties==
* supervising the lawfulness of the official acts of the Government and the President of the Republic
* providing the President, the Government and the Ministries with information and opinions on legal issues
* supervising that the courts of law, other authorities and civil servants, public employees and other persons obey the law and fulfill their obligations when performing public tasks
* monitoring the implementation of basic rights and liberties and human rights
* supervising the conduct of advocates with the Finnish Bar Association

{{Politics of France}}

The '''Constitutional Council''' ({{lang-fr|Conseil constitutionnel}};  {{IPA-fr|kɔ̃sɛj kɔ̃stitysjɔˈnɛl}}) is the highest constitutional authority in [[France]]. It was established by the [[Constitution of France|Constitution of the Fifth Republic]] on 4 October 1958 and its duty is to ensure that constitutional principles and rules are upheld. It is housed in the [[Palais-Royal]], [[Paris]].

Its main activity is to rule on whether proposed statutes conform with the Constitution, after they have been voted by Parliament and before they are signed into law by the [[President of the French Republic]] (''a priori'' review). However, since 1 March 2010, individual citizens who are party to a trial or a lawsuit have been able to ask for the Council to review whether the law applied in the case is constitutional. In 1971, the Council ruled that conformity with the Constitution also entails conformity with two other texts referred to in the preamble of the Constitution, the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and the preamble&lt;ref&gt;[[:wikisource:fr:Constitution de la IVe République#Pr.C3.A9ambule|Preamble of the Constitution of the Fourth Republic]], Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; of the constitution&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Constitution du 27 octobre 1946|Constitution of the Fourth French Republic]], Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], both of which list constitutional rights.

==The Council and the enactment of legislation in France==
:''This article refers extensively to individual articles in the Constitution of France. The reader should refer to the [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp official translation] of the Constitution on the site of the [[French National Assembly]]. Another recommended reading is the [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/presentation/presentation.25739.html Constitutional Council overview] on the Council web site.''
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|left|The 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].]]

The [[Government of France]] [[Separation of powers|consists]] of an [[executive branch]] ([[President of France|President of the Republic]], [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], ministers, and their services and affiliated organizations), a [[legislative branch]] (both houses of [[French Parliament|Parliament]]), and a [[judicial branch]]. The [[Judiciary of France|judicial branch]] is, unlike for instance the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal judiciary]] of the United States under the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], not organized into a single hierarchy ([[Judiciary of France#Administrative Stream|administrative courts]] fall under the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Council of State]], [[Judiciary of France#Civil courts|civil]] and [[Judiciary of France#Criminal courts|criminal courts]] under the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]]), and some of its entities also have advisory functions. For historical reasons there has long been a hostility to having anything resembling a "Supreme Court"—that is, a powerful court able to quash legislation.&lt;ref name="Beardsley"&gt;James Beardsley, ''Constitutional Review in France'', The Supreme Court Review, Vol. 1975, (1975), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3108812 pp. 189–259]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Michael H. Davis, ''The Law/Politics Distinction, the French Conseil Constitutionnel, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U. S. Supreme Court]]'', The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 34, No. 1 (Winter, 1986), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840292 pp. 45–92]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tallon"&gt;Denis Tallon, John N. Hazard, George A. Bermann, ''The Constitution and the Courts in France'', The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 27, No. 4 (Autumn, 1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/839794 pp. 567–587]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the Council is a court is a subject of academic discussion,&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[François Luchaire]], « Le Conseil constitutionnel est-il une juridiction ? », ''Revue du droit public et de la science politique en France et à l'étranger (RDP)'', janvier-juin 1979 (volume 1), pp. 27–52&lt;/ref&gt; but some scholars consider it the [[supreme court]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Waline, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/838736 The Constitutional Council of the French Republic]'', The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 12, No. 4 (Autumn, 1963), pp. 483–493 lists reasons for the Council to be considered as a court: "If it be admitted that a judicial authority is characterized by the effect of ''[[res judicata]]'' attaching to its decisions,  it must necessarily be concluded that
the Constitutional Council is a court, and even the supreme court of the State"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic]] distinguishes two distinct kinds of legislation: [[statute law]], which is normally voted upon by [[Parliament of France|Parliament]] (except for ''[[ordonnance (French constitutional law)|ordonnance]]s'') and government regulations, which are enacted by the Prime Minister and his government as [[decree]]s and other regulations (''arrêtés'').&lt;ref name="Beardsley"/&gt; Article 34 of the Constitution exhaustively lists the areas reserved for statute law: these include, for instance, [[criminal law]].

Any regulation issued by the executive in the areas constitutionally reserved for statute law is unconstitutional unless it has been authorized as [[secondary legislation]] by a statute. Any citizen with an interest in the case can obtain the cancellation of these regulations by the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], on grounds that the executive has exceeded its authority. Furthermore, the Council of State can quash regulations on grounds that they violate existing statute law, constitutional rights or the "general principles of law".&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Neville Brown, John Bell, Jean-Michel Galabert, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=v_X1xhiyl28C French administrative law]'', 5 ed., 1998, [[Clarendon Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-826555-7}}; see p. 220 for the general principles of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, new acts can be referred to the Constitutional Council by a petition just prior to being signed into law by the President of the Republic. The most common circumstance for this is that 60 opposition members of the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]], or 60 opposition members of the [[Senate of France|Senate]] request such a review.&lt;ref name="Prosser"/&gt;

If the Prime Minister thinks that some clauses of existing statute law instead belong to the domain of regulations, he can also ask the Council to reclassify these clauses as regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Article 37 of the Constitution: "Provisions of statutory origin enacted in such matters may be amended by decree issued after consultation with the Council of State. Any such provisions passed after the coming into force of the Constitution shall be amended by decree only if the Constitutional Council has found that they are matters for regulation as defined in the foregoing paragraph."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An example of such reclassification is decision [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/2008/2008-210-l/decision-n-2008-210-l-du-07-mai-2008.12133.html 2008-210 L] of 7 May 2008, with scholarly commentary in ''[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/2008/2008-210-l/decision-n-2008-210-l-du-07-mai-2008.12133.html Commentaire de la décision n° 2008-210 L du 7 mai 2008 – Nature juridique de dispositions du code de la route]'' ("Comments on decision 2008-210 L of 7 May 2008 – Juridical nature of provisions in the Road code") in ''Les Cahiers du Conseil constitutionnel, Cahier n° 25'' ("The Constitutional Council's notebooks"): the name of the administration with which certain administrative procedures should be filed is not the domain of statute law, but of regulation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, France refused to accept the idea that courts could quash legislation enacted by Parliament (though administrative courts could quash regulations produced by the executive). This goes back to the French revolutionary era: pre-revolutionary courts had often used their power not to register laws and thus prevent their application for political purposes, and had blocked reforms. French courts were then prohibited from making rulings of a general nature. Also, it seemed that if courts could quash legislation after it had been enacted and taken into account by citizens, it would introduce legal uncertainties: how could a citizen plan his or her actions according to what is legal or not if laws could ''a posteriori'' be found not to hold? Yet, in the late 20th century, courts, especially administrative courts, began applying the consequences of international treaties, including law of the [[European Union]], as superior to national law.

A 2009 reform, effective on 1 March 2010, enables parties to a lawsuit or trial to question the constitutionality of the law that is being applied to them. The procedure, known as ''question prioritaire de constitutionnalité'', is broadly as follows: the question is raised before the trial judge and, if it has merit, it is forwarded to the appropriate supreme court (Council of State if the referral comes from an administrative court, Cour de Cassation for other courts). The supreme court collects such referrals and submits them to the Constitutional Council. If the Constitutional Council rules a law to be unconstitutional, this law is struck down from the law books; this decision is valid for everybody and not only for the cases at hand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/en_ordinance_58_1067.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and tasks==
[[File:Conseil constitutionnel fr sallereunion.jpg|thumb|280px|Council reunion room]]
The Council has two main areas of power:
# The first is the supervision of elections, both [[President of France|presidential]] and [[Parliament of France|parliamentary]] and ensuring the legitimacy of [[referendum]]s (Articles 58, 59 and 60). They issue the official results, they ensure proper conduct and fairness, and they see that campaign spending limits are adhered to. The Council is the supreme authority in these matters. The Council can declare an election to be invalid if improperly conducted, or if the elected candidate used illegal methods, or if he spent for his campaign over the legal limits.
# The second area of Council power is the interpretation of the fundamental meanings of the constitution, procedure, legislation, and treaties. The Council can declare dispositions of laws to be contrary to the ''[[Constitution of France]]'' or to the principles of constitutional value that it has deduced from the Constitution or from the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]''. It also may declare laws to be in contravention of [[treaty|treaties]] which France has signed, such as the ''[[European Convention on Human Rights]].'' Their declaring that a law is contrary to constitutional or treaty dispositions renders it invalid. The Council also may impose reservations as to the interpretation of certain provisions in statutes. The decisions of the Council are binding on all authorities.

In some cases, examination of laws by the Council is compulsory. [[Organic law#Organic laws in France|Organic bills]], those which fundamentally affect government and treaties, need to be assessed by the Council before they are considered ratified (Article 61-1 and 54). Amendments concerning the rules governing parliamentary procedures need to be considered by the Council, as well. Guidance may be sought from the Council in regard to whether reform should come under statute law (voted by Parliament) or whether issues are considered as ''règlement'' (regulation) to be adopted with [[decree]] of the [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]]. The re-definition of legislative dispositions as regulatory matters initially constituted a significant share of the (then light) caseload of the Council.

In the case of other statutes, seeking the oversight of the Council is not compulsory. However, the President of the Republic, the President of the Senate, the President of the Assembly, the Prime Minister of France, or 60 members of the National Assembly, or 60 Senators&lt;ref&gt;Note that this is not 60 members of Parliament: all members on the referral petition must be from the same house of Parliament, though of course members from both houses can submit petitions at the same time and with the same arguments.&lt;/ref&gt; can submit a statute for examination by the Council before its signing into law by the President. In general, it is the parliamentary [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] which brings laws that it deems to infringe civil rights before the Council.&lt;ref name="Prosser"&gt;[[Tony Prosser]], ''Constitutions and Political Economy: The Privatisation of Public Enterprises in France and Great Britain'', The Modern Law Review, Vol. 53, No. 3 (May 1990), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1096473 pp. 304–320]; see p. 307 "The number of references has steadily grown; it is no
exaggeration to claim that any important controversial legislation is now likely to be referred."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another task of the council, of lesser importance in terms of number of referrals, is the reclassification of statute law into the domain of regulations, on the Prime Minister's request. This happens when the Prime Minister and his government wish to alter law that has been enacted as statute law, but should instead belong to regulations according to the Constitution. The Prime Minister has to obtain reclassification from the Council prior to taking any [[decree]] changing the regulations. This, however, is nowadays only a small fraction of the Council's activity: in 2008, out 140 of decisions, only 5 concerned reclassifications.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Council, [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/2008/les-decisions-de-2008.425.html Index of 2008 decisions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and evolution==
[[File:Conseil Constitutionnel, logo 2016.svg|thumb|left|Logotype of the Constitutional Council of France.]]
While since the 19th century the judicial review that the Constitutional Council brings to bear on the acts of the [[executive branch]] has played an increasingly large role, the politicians that framed the successive French institutions have long been reluctant to have the judiciary review legislation. The argument was that un-elected judges should not be able to overrule directly the decisions of the democratically elected legislature. This may also have reflected the poor impression that the political action of the [[parlement]]s – courts of justice under the [[ancien régime]] monarchy – had left: these courts often had chosen to block legislation in order to further the privileges of a small caste. Whatever the reasons, the idea was that legislation was a political tool, and that the responsibility of legislation should be borne by the legislative body.&lt;ref name="Beardsley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tallon"/&gt;

Originally, the Council was meant to have rather technical responsibilities: ensuring that national elections were fair, arbitrating the division between statute law (from the legislative) and regulation (from the executive), etc. The Council role of safekeeping fundamental rights was probably not originally intended by the drafters of the Constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic]]: it was thought that Parliament should be able to see for itself that it did not infringe on such rights. However, the Council's activity considerably extended in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Jan, ''Le Conseil constitutionnel'', Pouvoirs n° 99 2001/4, pp. 71–86, [[Le Seuil]], {{ISBN|2-02-048213-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1958 to 1970, under [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s presidency, the Constitutional Council was sometimes described as a "cannon aimed at Parliament", protecting the executive branch against encroachment by statute law voted by Parliament. All but one referral to the Constitutional Council came from the Prime Minister, against acts of Parliament, and the Council agreed to partial annulments in all cases. The only remaining referral came from the President of the Senate, [[Gaston Monnerville]], against the [[French presidential election referendum, 1962|1962 referendum]] on the direct election of the President of the Republic, which Charles de Gaulle supported; and the Council ruled itself "incompetent" to cancel the direct expression of the will of the French people.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Stone, ''The Birth of Judicial Politics in France: The Constitutional Council in Comparative Perspective'', [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-507034-8}}, chapter III&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, however, the Council ruled unconstitutional ([http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1971/7144dc.htm Decision 71-44DC]) some provisions of a law changing the rules for the incorporation of private nonprofit associations, because they infringed on freedom of association, one of the principles given in the 1789 ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]''; they used the fact that the preamble of the French constitution briefly referred to those principles to justify their decision. For the first time, a statute was declared unconstitutional not because it infringed on technical legal principles, but because it was deemed to infringe on personal freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Jérôme Favre, ''La décision du Conseil constitutionnel du 16 juillet 1971. L'invention d'un nouveau pouvoir juridictionnel.'', Revue d'étude politique des assistants parlementaires, nr 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Letourneur, R. Drago, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/837562 The Rule of Law as Understood in France]'', The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Spring, 1958), pp. 147–177&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the possibility to request a constitutional review was extended to 60 members of the National Assembly or 60 senators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000514191 Loi n°74-904 du 29 octobre 1974] portant révision de l'article 61 de la Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, the political opposition seized that opportunity to request the review of all controversial acts.&lt;ref name="Prosser"/&gt;

The Council increasingly has frowned upon "[[rider (legislation)|rider]]s" (''cavaliers'') – amendments or clauses introduced into bills but having no relationship to the original topic of the bill; for instance, "budgetary riders" in the Budget bill, or "social riders" in the Social security budget bill. ''See [[Rider (legislation)#Europe|legislative riders in France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Council, [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/pdf/Conseil/droitamd.pdf État de la jurisprudence du Conseil constitutionnel sur le droit d'amendement] ("State of the Constitutional Council case law on the right of amendment")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Les Cahiers du Conseil constitutionnel, Cahier n° 22, [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank/download/2006-544DC-ccc_544dc.pdf Commentaire] de la [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/2006/2006-544-dc/decision-n-2006-544-dc-du-14-decembre-2006.1016.html décision n° 2006-544 DC du 14 décembre 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, [[Pierre Mazeaud]], then president of the Council, announced that the Council would take a stricter view of language of a non-prescriptive character introduced in laws,&lt;ref&gt;Véronique Champeil-Desplats, ''[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/pdf/pdf_cahiers/cccc21.pdf N'est pas normatif qui peut. L'exigence de normativité dans la jurisprudence du Conseil constitutionnel.]'' ("Anything that can be [[Normative#Standards documents|normative]] is not. The exigence of normativity in the case law of the Constitutional Council"), in ''Les Cahiers du Conseil Constitutionnel'', nr 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes known as "legislative neutrons".&lt;ref&gt;The phrase ''neutron législatif'' ("legislative neutron") was coined by [[Jean Foyer]] to designate provisions in statute law that have "null juridical charge" and thus are ''neutral'' with respect to the state of law. This phrase uses imagery from [[particle physics]] – a neutron has null ''electrical'' charge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mazeaud-2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foyer"&gt;Proceedings of the National Assembly, [http://archives.assemblee-nationale.fr/7/cri/1981-1982-ordinaire2/115.pdf 21 June 1982, third sitting], Jean Foyer: « Cette semaine, le ministre d'État, ministre de la recherche et de la technologie, nous présente un projet dont je dirai, ne parlant pas latin pour une fois, mais empruntant ma terminologie à la langue des physiciens, qu'il est pour l'essentiel un assemblage de neutrons législatifs, je veux dire de textes dont la charge juridique est nulle. » – "This week, the minister of State, minister for research and technology &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; presents us a bill of which I'll say, without talking in latin for once, but instead borrowing my words from the physicists, that it is mostly an assembly of legislative neutrons, I mean of texts with a null juridical charge."&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of prescribing or prohibiting, as advocated by [[Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis|Portalis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis]], ''[http://classiques.uqac.ca/collection_documents/portalis/discours_1er_code_civil/discours.html Discours préliminaire du premier projet de Code civil]'' ("Preliminary speech for the first project for a [[Civil code]]"): « [La loi] permet ou elle défend ; elle ordonne, elle établit, elle corrige, elle punit ou elle récompense. » ("[Law] permits, or defends; it orders, it establishes, it corrects, it punishes or it rewards.")&lt;/ref&gt; such language makes statements about the state of the world, or wishes about what it should be. Previously, this language was considered devoid of juridical effects and thus harmless; but Mazeaud contended that introducing vague language devoid of juridical consequences just dilutes law unnecessarily. He denounced the use of law as an instrument of political communication, expressing vague wishes instead for effective legislation. Mazeaud also said that, because of the constitutional objective that law should be accessible and understandable, law should be precise and clear, and devoid of details or equivocal formulas.&lt;ref name="Mazeaud-2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/documentation-publications/le-conseil-au-jour-le-jour/le-conseil-en-2004/voeux-a-l-elysee.5147.html|title=Conseil Constitutionnel|first=|last=NEXINT|date=12 July 2008|website=conseil-constitutionnel.fr|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/2006/01/04/constitution-jean-louis-debre-et-pierre-mazeaud-font-la-lecon-au-gouvernement_727180_0.html MM.

{{As of|2004}}, one law out of two, including the budget, was sent to the Council at the request of the opposition. In January 2005, Pierre Mazeaud, then president of the Council, publicly deplored the inflation of the number of constitutional review requests motivated by political concerns, without much legal argumentation to back them on constitutional grounds.&lt;ref name="Mazeaud-2005"/&gt;

The [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008]] amended article 61 of the Constitution. It now allows for courts to submit questions of unconstitutionality of laws to the Constitutional Council. The [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] (supreme court over civil and criminal courts) and the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] (supreme court over administrative courts) filter the requests coming from the courts under them.

On 29 December 2012, the council said it is overturning an upper income tax rate of 75% due to be introduced in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=French 75% income tax thrown out|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20864114|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 1995, [[Roland Dumas]] was appointed president of the Council by [[François Mitterrand]]. Roland Dumas attracted major controversy twice. First, he appeared in scandals regarding the [[Elf Aquitaine]] oil company, with many details regarding his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], Christine Deviers-Joncour, and his expensive tastes in clothing appearing in the press.&lt;ref&gt;John Tagliabue, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/18/world/at-a-french-trial-a-tale-unfolds-of-graft-on-high.html At a French Trial, a Tale Unfolds of Graft on High]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the Council put forth some highly controversial opinions in a decision related to the [[International Criminal Court]], in [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1998/98408/98408dc.htm?CCONSTIT1=0310025720814089 Decision 98–408 DC], declaring that the sitting President of the Republic could be tried criminally only by the High Court of Justice, a special court organized by Parliament and originally meant for cases of high treason. This, in essence, ensured that [[Jacques Chirac]] would not face criminal charges until he left office. This controversial decision is now moot since the rules of responsibility of the President of the Republic were redefined by the [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://affaires-publiques.org/point/gp/pres.htm Responsabilité pénale du chef de l'Etat ?]'' ("The criminal responsibility of the head of state?"), Affaires Publiques&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, because of the [[Elf Aquitaine#Fraud scandal|Elf scandal]], Roland Dumas put himself on leave from the Council and [[Yves Guéna]] assumed the interim presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebdo.nouvelobs.com/hebdo/parution/p1843/articles/a38459-au_revoir_dumas_bonjour_sirven.html Les nouveaux rebondissements de l'affaire Elf – Au revoir Dumas, bonjour Sirven] ("Breaking news about the [[Elf Aquitaine#Fraud scandal|Elf case]] – Goodbye [[Roland Dumas|Dumas]], welcome [[Alfred Sirven|Sirven]]"), [[Le Nouvel Observateur]], N°1843&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Council attracted some controversy when [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] and [[Simone Veil]] campaigned for the proposed [[European Constitution]], which was submitted to the French voters in a referendum. Simone Veil had done so after obtaining a [[leave of absence]] from the Council, which was criticized by some, including [[Jean-Louis Debré]], president of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], as a dubious procedure – to follow their reasoning, what is the use of prohibiting appointed members of the council from conducting partisan politics if they can put themselves on leave for the duration of the campaign? She defended herself by pointing to precedent and famously remarked "How is that his business? He has no lesson to teach me." about Debré.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/france/2005/0,,3217497,00-referendum-simone-veil-repond-debre-.html Référendum : Simone Veil répond à Debré]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' (Referendum: [[Simone Veil]] responds to [[Jean-Louis Debré|Debré]]), [[La Chaîne Info|LCI]], 6 May 2005.

[[File:PR-2012-05-15 IMG 1526.jpg|thumb|[[Laurent Fabius]], current President of the Constitutional Council]]
The Council is made up of former Presidents of the Republic who have chosen to sit in the Council (which they may not do if they become directly involved in politics again), and nine other members who serve non-renewable terms of nine years, one third of whom are appointed every three years, three each by the [[President of France|President of the Republic]], the [[List of Presidents of the National Assembly of France|President of the National Assembly]], and the [[List of Presidents of the Senate of France|President of the Senate]].&lt;ref name="LO58-1067"&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000705065 Ordonnance n°58-1067 du 7 novembre 1958] portant loi organique sur le Conseil constitutionnel ("[[Ordonnance (French constitutional law)|Ordinance]] 58-1067 of 7 November 1958, [[organic law (France)|organic bill]] on the Constitutional council"). About swearing-in: article 3 says ''Avant d'entrer en fonction, les membres nommés du Conseil constitutionnel prêtent serment devant le Président de la République.'' ("Before assuming their duties, the appointed members of the Constitutional council are sworn in before the President of the Republic.")&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the Constitutional Council is selected by the President of the Republic.

Following the [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008|2008 constitutional revision]], appointments to the Council are subject to a parliamentary approval process (Constitution of France, articles 13 and 56). {{As of|2009|08}}, these provisions are not operational yet since the relevant procedures have not yet been set in law.

A [[quorum]] of seven members is imposed unless exceptional circumstances are noted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000705065 Ordonnance n°58-1067 du 7 novembre 1958], article 14&lt;/ref&gt; Votes are by majority of the members present at the meeting; the president of the Council has a [[casting vote]] in case of an equal split.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, article 56: ''Le président est nommé par le Président de la République. Il a voix prépondérante en cas de partage.''&lt;/ref&gt; For decisions about the incapacity of the President of the Republic, a majority of the members of the council is needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000705065 Ordonnance n°58-1067 du 7 novembre 1958], article 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution ([[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Grundgesetz]]) of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] establishes a separate [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] (Bundesverfassungsgericht) that is empowered with reviewing acts of the [[legislature]] (so mainly from the Federal Republic Congress - the [[Bundestag]]) for their [[constitutionality]].

Most [[States of Germany|states]] (Bundesländer) also have separate courts for the according purpose. These are separate Supreme Courts that do not deal with appellate cases in civil and criminal law - but rather, just in constitutional cases.

The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany can even review and reject constitutional amendments on the grounds that they are contradictory to the rest of the Federal Republic Constitution ("Verfassungswidriges Verfassungsrecht").  This goes beyond even the powers of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8755">The importance of '''corroboration''' is a unique feature of [[Scots criminal law]].&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/scotland/Controversial-Scottish-law-escapes-review.6846161.jp|title=The corroboration rule, unique to Scots law|last=Rose|first=Gareth|date=2 October 2011|work=Scotland on Sunday|accessdate=2 October 2011|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cornerstone of Scots law, the requirement for [[corroborating evidence]] means at least two different and independent sources of evidence are required in support of each crucial fact before a defendant can be convicted of a crime.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-13004941|title=Consultation issued on Scots law after Cadder ruling|date=2 October 2011|work=BBC News Scotland|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means, for example, that an [[Admission (law)|admission of guilt]] by the accused is insufficient evidence to convict in Scotland, because that evidence needs to be corroborated by another source. However, testimony from some experts, such as forensic medical examiners or doctors, is accepted by courts on the basis of the expert's report alone, therefore requiring no corroboration.

==History==
Corroboration had, in some way, already been established by the time the earliest Institutional Writers had begun to illustrate Scots criminal law. MacKenzie described the ‘singularity’ of witnesses, and their ‘contrariety’, as insufficient proof  - subsequently repeated by Hume, ‘…no one shall in any case be convicted on the testimony of a single witness’.&lt;ref&gt;BD Hume, ii p.385 (241)&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar statement appears in Alison.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Alison, Principles and Practice of the Criminal Law of Scotland, 1833, p.551&lt;/ref&gt;  
Corroboration can also be traced to Biblical sources. The New Testament stated, ‘In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established’&lt;ref&gt;The New Testament, 2 Corinthians, 13 verse 1&lt;/ref&gt; - although it is unlikely that the requirement is based solely from the Bible. 
Corroboration also has origins in Roman law. The Code of Justinian read, ‘We plainly order that the evidence of only one witness shall not be taken’.&lt;ref&gt;XX Concerning Witnesses, Book IV, 334 AD&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that at this time, the requirement was based on the distrust of juries - however, it is suggested that it was the mistrust of judges instead, which allowed corroboration to take root.&lt;ref&gt;JH Langbein, Torture and the Law of Proof, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Cadder ruling]] in 2010, [[Colin Sutherland, Lord Carloway|Lord Carloway]] was appointed to lead a review of the 'corroboration rule' - The Carloway Review. In this review, Lord Carloway gave the following proposal – the current requirement for corroboration in criminal cases should be abolished.

==Corroboration in Modern Policing==

Corroboration is a key element of modern policing, in that Scottish Criminal law requires a sufficiency of evidence to be presented, in other words; "There must be sufficient admissible evidence, to prove beyond all reasonable doubt, that the accused committed the crime or offence libelled"&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Police College Initial Training Course - Module 2&lt;/ref&gt;

This involves the principle of corroboration which means that one piece of evidence must be backed up by another piece of evidence.

It is the responsibility of the police to gather all available evidence and disclose it to the Crown. The Crown will decide what evidence will be led and in which court should a trial be required. 

The most common form of corroboration in regards to criminal offences is the two or more eyewitnesses scenario. Any witness undertaking an oath in court is accepted as being a credible witness and as such, their statement to the court must be taken as truth (although a defence lawyer will attempt to prove this not to be the case through cross examination, undermining their character, pointing out inconsistencies, etc.).

Therefore, if a reporter of an offence makes a statement saying suspect 'x' hit them, and there is a witness who states in a statement that they saw this happen, this is corroboration and this is sufficiency of evidence, providing suitable grounds for the suspect to be charged by police and have their status changed to 'accused'.

This is known as &lt;nowiki/&gt;'best evidence' and should always be led first at court. Thereafter, further points of corroboration can be raised to the court.

These can include:
* CCTV - This must show footage relevant to the offence in which the suspect can be identified (usually by police officers or witnesses) - in this instance, it is not the CCTV that is the corroboration, but is it the police or witnesses identifying the suspect on CCTV that are the corroboration
* Injuries - Again, the injury in and of itself is not sufficient. A medical statement from a trained person such as a doctor stating; "This injury was caused by blunt trauma to the back of the head, within which there are small fragments of glass" is the corroboration, not the injury
* Forensic evidence - Fingerprints and DNA primarily, with again, the Forensic Scientist identifying those pieces of evidence as belonging to the accused being the corroboration
* Telecomms information - Where an application was submitted and approved to identify the owner of a phone number, it is this information which identifies the phone as belonging to the accused, but again, it is the police officer who corroborates this to be a true document
There are many more examples of corroboration, and these are a few of the key ones most commonly presented to the court.

The court will not normally accept the testimony of a single witness, no matter how credible, as being the truth unless there is further evidence via corroboration. It is worth noting that not every witness presented to the court must have the same story, or be believable. Even if you have ten witnesses with eight of them presenting contradicting stories, if two witnesses provide a similar version of events which ties in with the related offence, guilt can be found based on the two witnesses alone. It will make the prosecution harder for the Procurator Fiscal as the defence will use this contradiction to sway the Sheriff, but otherwise this is acceptable evidence. Commonly this can be found in colours of vehicles, where many witnesses will have a distorted recollection of the actual colour.

Contrary to popular belief, there are several occasions where corroboration is not required. Road traffic offences such as obstruction, excise and failure to obey traffic signs or signals are some examples of this.

In instances where there is no direct corroboration, police can still accumulate sufficient indirect or circumstantial evidence to allow a prosecution to be pursued.

Circumstantial evidence can be:
* Motive - Accused was motivated to commit crime through greed, revenge, malice, etc.
* Ability - Accused had the skills or strength etc., necessary to commit crime
* Guilty intent - Accused acted with the intention of committing the crime. For example, a planned armed robbery
* Identification - Forensic evidence, DNA, fingerprints, fibres, etc.
* Conduct after the crime - Evidence that the accused has disposed of incriminating evidence, 'laid low' etc.
* Opportunity - Evidence that the accuse was at or near the locus at the time, or had privileged access, etc.
* Preparation - Evidence that the accused purchased a weapon or obtained housebreaking tools in preparation to commit the crime, etc.

Again, it is worth noting that where there are no eyewitnesses or direct corroboration of events, such as a murder, the above list can be used to corroborate through sufficiency and prosecute an accused. So for example, a vehicle being tagged by an ANPR unit on a road that leads to a certain location; fingerprints and DNA being found on the body; the accused being found in possession of a blood stained knife and the DNA from that blood being linked to a victim - all this would provide sufficiency circumstantial evidence and corroboration through sufficiency.

==Field of study==
As a legal system founded on [[civil law system|civil law]] principles, evidence in Scots law is normally studied as a branch of [[procedural law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6232">The '''Crucifix Decrees''' (''Crucifix Struggle'') were part of the [[Nazi Regime]]’s efforts to secularize public life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kreuz und Hakenkreuz|last=Neuhäusler|first=Johann|publisher=Kathol. Kirche Bayerns|year=1946|isbn=|volume=2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[crucifix]]es throughout public places like schools were to be replaced with the Fuhrer’s picture. The Crucifix Decrees throughout the years of 1935 to 1941 sparked protests against removing crucifixes from traditional places. Protests notably occurred in [[Oldenburg]] (Lower Saxony) in 1936, Frankenholz (Saarland) and Frauenberg (East Prussia) in 1937, and in Bavaria in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17298934|title=Zur Sache--das Kreuz! : Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Konflikts um Kreuz und Lutherbild in den Schulen Oldenburgs, zur Wirkungsgeschichte eines Massenprotests und zum Problem nationalsozialistischer Herrschaft in einer agrarisch-katholischen Region|date=1987|publisher=Vechtaer Druckerei und Verlag|others=Kuropka, Joachim.|isbn=3884410377|edition= 2., durchgesehene Aufl|location=Vechta|oclc=17298934}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents helped to encourage Nazi party leaders to back away from crucifix removals in 1941.

== Historical Significance ==
Significance within the Crucifix Decrees lies within the single-issue based event that it was. Protesting in these cases was not directed towards the regime rather it was over a fundamental idea. The following list are some of the events related to the Crucifix Decrees:

* From 1935-1941, there were many cars blowing horns, church bells ringing in order to produce a general sense of disruption.
* Many mother's visited delegation meetings and threatened to remove their children from school. 
* Women were putting crucifixes around their children going into school's necks. 
* In 1935, a group of men pushed their way into a school to replace Hitler's picture with a crucifix. 
* The Bavarian Government Presidents expressed concern about the interference of Holy days and the morale of the Catholic population in August 1937.
* In upper [[Franconia]] women wrote letters to their husbands on the war fronts to tell them what was going on at home in our to show how the war and home fronts were not on the same page.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50479485|title=Popular opinion and political dissent in the Third Reich, Bavaria 1933-1945|last=Ian|first=Kershaw|date=2002|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0199251118|edition= New |location=Oxford|oclc=50479485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, another significant note is how there were different reactions to the crucifix decrees on Nazi leaders' sides. For example, in [[Oldenburg]] during 1936 a [[Gauleiter]] speech the crowd expected him to rescind the crucifix decrees, but he began his speech on racial problems in Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another example occurred in the district of [[Eberswalde|Ebergs]] where not a single crucifix was removed from the start.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These examples show how single issues ranged among Nazi officials' levels of strictness.

One German term "Handlungsspielraum" is the collective opinion being expressed in a way that the regime has to respond to. This term signifies that organized protest, like those in the Crucifix Decrees among others, forces the regime to take notice and possible action.

Furthermore, these events were part of [[Gleichschaltung]] on a larger note because of the all-encompassing mentality of the regime. This was a sign that the regime was taking a step into religion, yet not completely voluntarily on the citizens' side.

== A Woman's Role ==
The [[Nazi Regime|regime]] saw noteworthy public protests by primarily Catholics, like those resulting from the Crucifix Decrees, and women. Public protest in the war increased as each event was single-issue based. During wartime, with more women on the home-front there were more issues that became oppressive and therefore women found this as a "source of complaint".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898529574|title=Protest in Hitler's "National Community" : Popular Unrest and the Nazi Response|others=Stoltzfus, Nathan,, Maier-Katkin, Birgit, 1962-|isbn=9781782388241|location=New York|oclc=898529574}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Rosenstrasse protest|Rosenstrasse Protest]] and the [[Witten Women's Protest|Witten Women’s Protest]] were two reactions against specific actions: the Rosenstrasse Protest being one event and the Witten Women's Protest being a string of events. It is important to again note how these protests were not in reaction against the regime or [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], rather they were against specific personal concerns. It can be thought that the regime would have responded to public protests against the regime itself.

The '''Dominion Party''' was a [[South Africa]]n political party establish in late October 1934 by dissatisfied members of the [[South African Party]] when that party fused with the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] to form the [[United Party (South Africa)|United National South African Party]], commonly referred to as the "United Party".

Its formation was mainly due to distrust of the motives of then-[[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] [[J.B.M. Hertzog]] and the new [[Afrikaner nationalist]] faction he brought into the now-united Party. The party was established principally to maintain South Africa's "British connection" (it campaigned to keep the [[Union Jack]] and [[God Save the Queen]] in 1938 and to enter the [[Second World War]] in 1939 on the side of Britain)&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, D.W. ''The Making of a Nation: A History of the Union of South Africa 1910-1961''. 1969. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly the [[Natal Province|Natal]]'s distinct British culture. The Party won 8 seats in the [[South African general election, 1938|1938 general election]] and lost one in [[South African general election, 1943|1943]]. It acquired no seats in [[South African general election, 1948|1948 election]], and disappeared from national politics.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger above. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion Party leader was Colonel [[Charles Stallard|C.F. Stallard]], who later served as Minister of Mines during the [[Second Jan Smuts government|second Ministry]] of [[Jan Smuts]].&lt;ref&gt;Kruger above. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The withdrawal of Hertzog and his supporters from the UP government in 1939 can be said to have made the party redundant, explaining its later decline.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48103">The '''English law of unjust enrichment''' is part of the [[English law]] of obligations, along with the law of [[English contract law|contract]], [[English tort law|tort]], and [[English trust law|trusts]]. The law of [[unjust enrichment]] deals with circumstances in which one person is required make [[Restitution in English law|restitution]] of a benefit acquired at the expense of another in circumstances which are unjust.

The modern law of unjust enrichment encompasses what was once known as the law of [[quasi-contract]]. Its precise scope remains a matter of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Virgo, ''Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2015); Burrows, ''Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2011); Mitchell, Mitchell, Watterson, ''Goff &amp; Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment'' (8th ed, 2011); Edelman and Degeling, ''Equity in Commercial Law'' (LexisNexis, 2005).
&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond quasi-contract, it is sometimes said to encompass the law relating to [[subrogation]], [[Contribution claim (legal)|contribution]], recoupment, and claims to the [[Tracing in English law|traceable]] substitutes of misapplied property.

English courts have recognised that there are four steps required to establish a claim in unjust enrichment.&lt;ref name="2015 UKSC 66"/&gt; If the following elements are satisfied, a claimant has a [[prima facie]] right to [[Restitution in English law|restitution]]:
* (1) the defendant has been ''enriched'';
* (2) this enrichment is ''at the claimant's expense''; 
* (3) this enrichment at the claimant's expense is ''unjust''; and 
* (4) there is no applicable bar or defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The law of unjust enrichment is among the most unsettled areas of [[English law]]. Its existence as a separate body of law was only explicitly recognised in 1991 in ''[[Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd]]''.&lt;ref name="bailii1988"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd]] |year=1988 |court=UKHL |num=12 |parallelcite=[1991] 2 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 548}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the law has rapidly developed over the last two decades, controversy continues over the precise structure, scope and nature of the law of unjust enrichment.

==Background==

=== History ===
The notion of an obligation to make restitution of benefits received at another's expense can be traced back to Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Theophilus, Paraphrase 3.27.3, 5; Gaius,&amp;nbsp;''Institutes''&lt;/ref&gt; Its history in English law can be traced to the [[form of action]] known as ''indebitatus assumpsit''. From this action came the 'common money counts'. Of present relevance are the following: 
* [[Money had and received|an action for money had and received to the plaintiff's use]]; 
* an action for money paid to the defendant's use; 
* ''quantum meruit'' (that is, a claim for reasonable remuneration for services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant); and 
* ''quantum valebat'' (that is, a claim for the reasonable value of goods provided by the plaintiff to the defendant).
During the course of the 18th and 19th centuries the law of contract, the law of tort and the law of trusts emerged as discrete bodies of law within English private law. As many thought they covered the field, restitutionary claims as embodied in the common money counts were appended to the law of contract. The various claims were termed '[[quasi-contract]]ual'. This was because it was often necessary to plead that the defendant had promised to repay a debt, even though the promise was fictitious and the debt was imposed by the law. While restitutionary obligations were not enforced solely through these quasi-contractual claims, the law of quasi-contract constitutes the core of the modern law of unjust enrichment. A seminal case is ''[[Moses v Macferlan]]'' (1760) 2 Burr 1005.

Perhaps more than any other area of the common law, the law of unjust enrichment has been shaped by academic writing,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Commerzbank v Gareth Price-Jones'' [2004] EWCA Civ 1663 at [47] (Mummery LJ).&lt;/ref&gt; particularly by that of jurists from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Of course, the law did not develop in a vacuum: the [[American Law Institute]] drafted a ''[[Restatement of the Law of Restitution]]'' in 1937. The [[Goff &amp; Jones|first major practitioner text in England]] appeared in 1966, written by [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Robert Goff]] and [[Gareth Jones (lawyer)|Gareth Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;[[R Goff]] and [[G Jones]], ''The Law of Restitution'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; It was Robert Goff (by this time [[Lord Goff]]) who gave the leading judgment in ''[[Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd]]'' over two decades later. [[Peter Birks|Professor Peter Birks]] was instrumental in promoting the autonomy of unjust enrichment within the law of obligations in his seminal work ''Introduction to the Law of Restitution.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic writing continues to be heavily cited by the highest courts, particularly the more recent work of [[Andrew Burrows|Professor Andrew Burrows]] and [[Graham Virgo|Professor Graham Virgo]], as well as modern editions of ''Goff &amp; Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment'', now edited by [[Charles Mitchell (professor)|Professor Charles Mitchell]], Professor Paul Mitchell, and Dr Stephen Watterson. A good example of the close relationship between the academy and the profession in the development of this area of law is seen in the recent publication of the [[A Restatement of the English Law of Unjust Enrichment|''Restatement of the English Law of Unjust Enrichment'']]''.''

=== Restitution or unjust enrichment? ===
As it has developed, the law of unjust enrichment has frequently been referred to as the 'law of restitution'. The difficulty with this is that it emphasises a legal ''response'' (restitution) rather than the ''event'' which gives rise to it (unjust enrichment).&lt;ref&gt;On this point, see generally Peter Birks, 'Property and Unjust Enrichment: Categorical Truths' [1997] NZLR 623.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, it is akin to treating contract (an event which gives rise to an obligation to perform) as coterminous with compensation (the law's response to non-performance or defective performance). That approach is problematic: the law of compensation is wider than contract, encompassing compensation claims arising out of tortious conduct. This is equally true of restitution: a claimant can obtain restitution not only for an unjust enrichment, but also for a tort. It is in this sense that one can say that restitution is multi-causal: it is a legal response to a number of different events.

=== Continuing controversies ===
Controversy continues to surround many aspects of the modern law of unjust enrichment. This controversy extends to its existence as an independent body of law, some arguing that the concept of unjust enrichment lacks the explanatory power it is so frequently asserted to have.&lt;ref&gt;See Edelman and Degeling, ''Equity in Commercial Law'' (LexisNexis, 2005); Steve Hedley, ''A Critical Introduction to the Law of Restitution'' (1st ed, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be misleading to exaggerate the level of controversy, however. At least in English law, there is high authority accepting the principle of unjust enrichment as having fundamental explanatory force in this area of law.&lt;ref name="bailii1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2015 UKSC 66"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Bank of Cyprus v Menelaou |year=2015 |court=UKSC |num=66 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent decisions have continue to clarify key aspects of actions in unjust enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Benedetti v Sawiris]] |year=2013 |court=UKSC |num=50 }} on the meaning of enrichment.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, uncertainty pervades key areas of the law:
* ''Enrichment.''  The principles of enrichment and expense are more stable in cases of transfers of goods or money, but contested in cases where [[UK labour law|labour]] and benefits in kind are passed. This distinction owes its origin to the fact that, historically speaking, these were different kinds of claim.&lt;ref&gt;Namely, an action for money had and received (for money), a quantum meruit (for services), or a quantum valebat (for goods).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''At the claimant's expense''. Cases in which a benefit is received by way of a third party can cause difficult issues for courts, given the traditional assumption that a benefit must be acquired directly from the claimant.
* '''Unjust' factors.'' English law has typically adopted an 'unjust factor' approach, whereby the claimant must positively identify a reason why the defendant's enrichment is 'unjust'. 'Unjust' is a generalisation of all the circumstances in which the law calls for restitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|987|2003|litigants=Wasada Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority (NSW) (No 2)|pinpoint=[16]}} (Campbell J) citing Mason and Carter, ''Restitution Law in Australia'' (LexisNexis, 2nd ed, 2008) 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognised grounds of restitution include mistake, duress, undue influence and failure of consideration. The unjust factor approach contrasts with certain [[Civil law (legal system)|civilian]] systems which may adopt an 'absence of basis' approach, whereby the claimant need only show that there is no good reason ('basis') for the defendant's enrichment. 
* ''Defences.'' The categories of defences are also controversial: "change of position" is a general defence, although the law recognises estoppel, the ''[[bona fide]]'' purchaser defence, and others as alternatives.
* ''Remedy: personal or proprietary?'' The law's remedial response to unjust enrichment is particularly controversial. The historical core of unjust enrichment lies in quasi-contract. The quasi-contractual actions were common law claims which awarded a claimant the ''money value'' of the benefit received by the defendant. As the law has extended beyond such claims, unjust enrichment scholars have debated the scope of proprietary relief: that is, whether the court should recognise that (or declare that) the claimant has a beneficial or security interest in property held by the defendant (or a third party, as in the case of [[subrogation]] to extinguished rights).
Despite this controversy, the statement by [[William Deane|Justice Deane]] appears to remain an accurate statement of the place of unjust enrichment in the Anglo-Australian law of obligations:&lt;ref&gt;The statement is wholly endorsed by the current editors of Goff &amp; Jones: MItchell, MItchell, Watterson, ''Goff &amp; Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment'' (8th ed, 2011) at [1-01]ff.&lt;/ref&gt; "[The concept of unjust enrichment] constitutes a unifying legal concept which explains why the law recognises, in a variety of distinct categories of case, an obligation on the part of a defendant to make fair and just restitution for a benefit derived at the expense of a plaintiff and which assists in the determination, by the ordinary processes of legal reasoning, of the question whether the law should, in justice, recognise such an obligation in a new or developing category of case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1987|litigants=[[Pavey &amp; Matthews Pty Ltd v Paul]] |parallelcite=(1987) 162 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 221 at 257 (Deane J) |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic framework==
{{see also|Unjust enrichment|Restitution}}
English courts have recognised that there are four steps involved in establishing a claim to restitution for unjust enrichment. This analytic framework was developed by academics such as [[Peter Birks|Professor Peter Birks]]. The four steps were expressly endorsed by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (now [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]]) in ''[[Banque Financière de la Cité v Parc (Battersea) Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Banque Financière de la Cité v Parc (Battersea) Ltd]]'' [1999] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 221, per Lord Steyn and Lord Hoffmann, cf {{cite BAILII| litigants=[[Gibb v Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust]] |year=2010 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=678 |pinpoint=[26]-[27]}}, Laws LJ critiquing the open-endedness of Lord Hoffmann's elaboration of the "unjust" step of a claim. This held an NHS trust had not acted ''ultra vires'' so that a £250k payment to a former chief executive could not be recovered as being irrationally overpaid.&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of four questions: 
* (1) is a defendant ''enriched'' or ''benefited''? 
* (2) is the enrichment ''at the claimant's expense''? 
* (3) is the enrichment ''unjust''? 
* (4) are there any ''defences''? 
Subsequent case law and academic writing has given greater content to this commonly accepted framework. The application of the formula can be illustrated by ''[[Kelly v Solari]].''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kelly v Solari]]'' (1841) 9 M&amp;W 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, a company paid out a life insurance policy to a widow by mistake. The company brought an action for money had and received against the widow, seeking restitution of the mistaken payment. Analysed in modern language, the widow had been enriched at the company's direct expense. The 'unjust factor' was mistake: the company had conferred the benefit whilst labouring under the incorrect [[tacit assumption]] that the payment was due.

=== Controversy over the status of the analytical framework ===
The precise status of this analytic framework and its underpinning concept of unjust enrichment is controversial. 
* On the one hand, scholars have sought to provide a coherent, rational and principled structure to an area of law once riddled with legal fiction. They have also sought to avoid the perception that courts are dispensing palm tree justice by engaging in an open-ended consideration of the injustice of the circumstances. To this end, 'unjust enrichment' has been treated as a descriptive, taxonomical term with precise legal content: it does not invite some broad, discretionary examination of what is just or equitable on the facts of the case.&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{cite AustLII|HCA|14|2014|litigants=Australia Financial Services v Hills |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The framework is treated as conclusive of liability, producing a clear answer to whether a defendant is obliged to give restitution of a benefit acquired at another's expense. 
* On the other hand, some have suggested that the framework has too much of a 'broad-brush or legislative flavour'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=Gibbs v Maidstone |year=2010 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=678 |pinpoint=[26]}} (Lawes LJ).&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Supreme Court recently referred to the framework as 'broad headings for ease of exposition' and emphasised that they do not have 'statutory force'.&lt;ref name="2015 UKSC 66"/&gt;{{rp|para 19}} This debate about the precise content of 'unjust enrichment' and the utility of a strict theoretical framework is closely tied to jurisprudential debates about the role of conscience and [[Equity (law)|Equity]] in a modern system of law. Unjust enrichment has been a key battleground for the so-called 'fusion wars'.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Edelman and Degeling, ''Equity in Commercial Law'' (LexisNexis, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a matter of day-to-day practice, it is this framework which is routinely applied as the organising structure for the law. Nevertheless, practitioners frequently plead claims by reference to the old common counts. It is not yet possible to articulate the law without reference to these old categories. Whether it is desirable to do so remains a controversial question.

===Enrichment===
{{Clist enrichment}}
The first element of a claim is that a defendant is ''enriched''. This requirement distinguishes a claim in unjust enrichment from a claim in tort: the law of unjust enrichment is not concerned with compensation for loss, but rather with the restitution of gains.

Historically, the nature of one's claim differed depending upon the nature of the enrichment. For example, if the defendant had received money, the plaintiff would bring an action for money had and received. If the plaintiff had discharged a liability of the defendant by paying money to a third party, the plaintiff would bring an action for money paid to the defendant's use. If instead the defendant had received services or goods, the plaintiff would recover bring a quantum meruit or a quantum valebat, respectively. These were claims for the reasonable value of the services or goods. It is no longer necessary to plead one's form of action. Whilst lawyers often draft their claims by reference to this language, academic commentators tend to analyse the law without regard to such historical distinctions. In short, an 'enrichment' for the purposes of the modern law may include, amongst other things: (i) money; (ii) services; (iii) [[Personal property|chattels]]; and (iv) the discharge of a liability to a third party.

Whether a defendant has been enriched (and the proper valuation thereof) is determined objectively. Nevertheless, the law does take account of the defendant's autonomy. This is through the notion of 'subjective devaluation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In effect, a defendant is entitled to say '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''I do not value the benefit as much as you claim I do''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' or even ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'I did not want that benefit at all; to me it is worthless''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'. The law respects this argument because it protects individual autonomy. The law nevertheless 'looks for its limitations and curbs its excesses'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* (i) that the defendant ''requested'' the benefit; or 
* (ii) that the enrichment is an ''incontrovertible benefit''; or 
* (iii) that the defendant has ''freely accepted'' the benefit.
The principles relating to enrichment can be illustrated can be illustrated by the following cases. 
* In ''[[McDonald v Coys of Kensington (Sales) Ltd]]'', Mr McDonald purchased a [[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]] for £20,290 but was mistakenly also given a [[personalised number plate]] worth £15,000. By the time anyone realised, the plate had been registered in his name. He was therefore entitled to it under statute. The claimants (assignees of the original owners) sought restitution. Was Mr McDonald 'enriched' by receipt of a number plate personalised for another? The Court held that the benefit was an incontrovertible benefit - that is, a benefit that no reasonable person in the defendant's position would deny. The reason was that 'justice requires that a person, who ... has a benefit or the right to a benefit for which he knows that he has not bargained or paid, should reimburse the value ... if it is readily returnable without substantial difficulty or detriment and he chooses to retain it'.&lt;ref&gt;[2004] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/47.html EWCA Civ 47], [37]&lt;/ref&gt; That is, Mr McDonald's refusal to return the number plate suggested that he did sufficiently value the benefit, particularly when it was easily returnable.
* In ''[[Sempra Metals Ltd v IRC]]'' a company paid too much [[advance corporation tax]] to the public revenue. But for this mistake of law, the payment would have been deferred to a later time. The company sought recovery of the money with [[compound interest]]. Had the public revenue been 'enriched' by its early receipt of the money? The House of Lords held that compound interest was available. The question then become one of ''valuing'' the claim. The majority held that the enrichment was the opportunity to use the money: the public revenue had effectively received a loan. The decision illustrates that one can bring a claim in respect of the 'use value' of money.
* In ''[[Exall v Partridge]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1799) 8 TR 308, 101 ER 1405&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Exall left his carriage on Mr Partridge's property for repair. Partridge's landlord later seized Partridge's [[coachbuilding]] shop and the property inside, include Exall's carriage. In order to end the [[Distraint|distress]], Exall paid the rent, discharging Partridge's liability to his landlord. Exall then brought an action for money paid to the defendant's use. The [[Court of King's Bench]] held that the money could be recovered. Grose J said 'the law implies a promise by the three defendants to repay'. The law now recognises that the implication of a request by Partridge and a promise to pay Exall for the benefit (namely, the discharge of the liability) is fictitious. The case illustrates that one's discharge of a liability of another can constitute an 'enrichment' for the purposes of the law of unjust enrichment. In modern language, this was a claim for recoupment. Whether the principle underlying recoupment and contribution is 'unjust enrichment' remains a controversial question. [[File:White horse from air.jpg|thumb|''[[Rowe v Vale of White Horse DC]]'',&lt;ref name="bailii2003"&gt;[2003] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/388.html EWHC (Admin) 388]&lt;/ref&gt; held that receiving sewerage services was an "incontrovertible benefit".]]

===At the expense of another===
The enrichment must have come at the 'expense' of the claimant. There are two particularly difficult issues:
* ''Must the enrichment come directly from the claimant?'' Recent case law suggests that English law is moving away from a strict requirement that the enrichment come directly from the claimant. For example, courts have been willing to turn their attention to questions of causation and the 'economic reality' of the transaction, in lieu of strict directness.&lt;ref name="2015 UKSC 66"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Investment Trust Companies v Commissioner'' [2014] EWHC 458 (Ch) at [67]-[68].&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Must there be correspondence between the claimant's loss and the defendant's gain?'' Courts have generally adopted the view that there need not be complete 'equivalence' between loss and gain, provided there is a causal connection.&lt;ref&gt;See further: Graham Virgo, ''The Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2015) 118; McInnes, 'At the Plaintiff's Expense': Quantifying Restitutionary Relief' [1998] ''Cambridge Law Journal'' 472; Andrew Burrows, ''The Law of Restitution'' (2011, 3rd ed) 64-5.&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is related to the question whether there should be a 'passing on' defence: that is, whether a claimant should be able to recover from the defendant despite the claimant having 'passed on' the loss to third parties. There is no such defence in England, Australia or Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[[Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Birmingham City Council]] [1996] 4 All ER 733 (England); ''[[Kingstreet Investments Ltd v New Brunswick]]'' [2007] 1 SCR 3 (Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roxborough v Rothmans"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|68|2001|litigants=[[Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall Ltd]] |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are some statutory provisions providing for such a defence in each jurisdiction.
{{Clist expense}}
The requirement that the enrichment be 'at the claimant's expense' distinguishes restitution for unjust enrichment from restitution for wrongs. In the former case, there must be a subtraction from the wealth of the claimant, at least in a notional sense. In the latter, there is no such requirement. For example, where a [[fiduciary]] receives a benefit in breach of the 'no profit' rule, the defaulting fiduciary will hold that property on constructive trust for the principal.&lt;ref&gt;FHR European Ventures v Cedar Capital Partners [2015] AC 250&lt;/ref&gt; In such a case, the principal will have a direct (proprietary) claim against the fiduciary to recover the benefit. It does not matter that the principal (claimant) had no prior proprietary interest in the benefit, nor even that the benefit would never have otherwise been received by the principal.

===In circumstances which are 'unjust'===
In the eyes of the law, there is nothing objectionable about being enriched at the expense of another. But the law will intervene when such enrichment is 'unjust'. The question of injustice is not at large. English law adopts an 'unjust factor' approach to the law of restitution for unjust enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., See ''[[Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc v IRC]]'' [2006] UKHL 49&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a claimant must plead by reference to the various factors that the law recognises as 'unjust'.

In contrast to the English approach, most civil law jurisdictions adopt an 'absence of basis' analysis. On this view, a defendant's enrichment is 'unjustified' where there is no 'basis' for the defendant's receipt. An example of a 'basis' is where a defendant receives a benefit under a valid and subsisting contract. The difference is more than mere conceptual or semantic emphasis. Nevertheless, in the vast majority of cases, the outcome will be the same whether an 'unjust factor' or an 'absence of basis' approach is adopted.

English cases featuring general discussion on the question of injustice include:
* ''[[Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council]]'' [1999] 2 AC 349
* ''[[Woolwich v IRC]]'' [1993] AC 70
* ''[[Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation v HMRC]]'' [2012] UKSC 19, [2012] Bus LR 1033 [162]
* ''[[Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc v IRC]]'' [2006] UKHL 49

===Defences===
Establishing that a defendant has received a benefit at the expense of the claimant in circumstances which are unjust gives rise to a prima facie right to restitution. In most cases, this is typically a personal right to the money value of the benefit conferred. Liability is strict: there is no need to prove any wrongdoing on the part of the defendant.

The question then becomes whether there is a relevant bar or whether the defendant has a valid defence. Defences to restitutionary claims is a broader topic than defences to actions in unjust enrichment. Examples of defences or bars to restitutionary claims include: 
* Change of position; 
* Passing on;
* Estoppel; 
* Bona fide purchase for value without notice;
* Limitation periods; 
* Ministerial receipt;
* Receipt under a valid contractual or statutory obligation; and
* Lack of clean hands. 
Not all these defences are available to all restitutionary claims. The availability of a defence may turn on: whether a restitutionary claim is legal or [[Equity (law)|equitable]]; whether a claim is for a personal or proprietary remedy; and whether the claim is brought under national or EU law.

==Unjust factors==
Outlined below are the 'unjust factors' which have been recognised (or proposed) within the English law of unjust enrichment. Some of these doctrines feature in the law of contract, where they are termed 'vitiating factors'. The applicable principles are not always the same, however.

===Failure of consideration===
{{main article|Failure of consideration}}

{{Clist discharge by breach}}Where one person pays money to another for a consideration which wholly fails, he or she may be entitled to restitution on the ground of [[Failure of consideration|total failure of consideration]]. Academic writing typically refers to this ground as "failure of basis".&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Lord Toulson in ''Barnes v Eastenders'' [2014] UKSC 26; see generally, Virgo, ''Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2015); Burrows, ''Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2011); Mitchell, Mitchell, Watterson, ''Goff &amp; Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment'' (8th ed, 2011); Edelman and Degeling, ''Equity in Commercial Law'' (LexisNexis, 2005).
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Meaning of consideration ====
"Consideration" in this context does not bear its [[Consideration in English law|contractual meaning]]. This can be a particular source of confusion, given that the ground of restitution known as "failure of consideration" typically arises in contractual contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Note that it is generally not possible to obtain restitution on the ground of total failure of consideration where a contract is subsisting. "Contractual context" here should be interpreted broadly: it refers to situations in which there is, or was a contract.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In its ''narrow'' and most commonly encountered sense, consideration refers to the failure of the condition on which a benefit was conferred.&lt;ref&gt;See Frederick Wilmot-Smith, 'Reconsidering "Total" Failure' (2013) 72(2) ''Cambridge Law Journal'' 414-36.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In its ''broader'' sense, consideration refers to the failure of a legal or factual state of affairs which has failed to materialise or subsist.&lt;ref name="Roxborough v Rothmans"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Barnes v Eastenders |year=2014 |court=UKSC |num=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The total failure rule ====
The orthodox rule is that the failure of consideration must be ''total''. This means that the claimant must not have received any part of the bargained-for counter-performance;&lt;ref&gt;''Rover International v Cannon'' [1989] 1 WLR 912&lt;/ref&gt; or, more accurately, that the defendant must not have commenced rendering performance.&lt;ref&gt;''Stocznia Gdanska v Latvian Shipping'' [1989] 1 WLR 574&lt;/ref&gt; The total failure rule has been subject to persistent academic criticism.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Barnes v Eastenders'' [2014] UKSC 26&lt;/ref&gt; It is subject to several qualifications. In such cases, the claimant may still be entitled to restitution. Examples include:
* Where, properly construed, the benefit received by the defendant did not form part of the bargained-for counter-performance;
* Where the claimant has only received an "incidental" benefit;&lt;ref&gt;''Giedo van der Garde BV v Force India Formula One Team'' [2010] EWHC 2373 (QB)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Where the claimant has a legal right to reject the benefit and return it in specie;&lt;ref&gt;''Rowland v Divall'' [1923] 2 KB 500&lt;/ref&gt;
* Where there has been a total failure in relation to a severable part.&lt;ref&gt;''Giedo van der Garde BV v Force India Formula One Team'' [2010] EWHC 2373 (QB)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Claims in respect of non-money benefits ====
The ground of restitution known as total failure of developed within the [[Money had and received|action for money had and received]]. That action was only available in respect of money claims. Where the claimant conferred a non-money benefit upon a defendant, the correct form of action was a ''quantum meruit'' (services) or ''quantum valebat'' (goods). It is tolerably clear that failure of consideration can now apply to non-money claims.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Cobbe v Yeoman's Row'' [2008] UKHL 55; ''Barnes v Eastenders'' [2014] UKSC 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taxonomy ====
Failure of consideration typically arises where a contract is "ineffective".&lt;ref&gt;Keith Mason, John Carter, Gregory Tolhurst, ''Mason &amp; Carter's Restitution Law in Australia'' (2nd ed, 2008) 311ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a term of art, but rather a useful tool for exposition.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Mason, John Carter, Gregory Tolhurst, ''Mason &amp; Carter's Restitution Law in Australia'' (2nd ed, 2008) 312ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A contract may be ineffective for a number of reasons. Failure of consideration may arise:
* Where a contract is discharged for [[Breach of contract|breach]] or repudiation by the claimant or defendant;
* Where a contract is unenforceable for want of compliance with the relevant formalities;
* Where a contract is discharged by [[Frustration in English law|frustration]];&lt;ref&gt;See [[Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd|''Fibrosa Spolka v Fairbairn'']] [1942] UKHL 4; restitution for frustrated contracts are now governed by the ''[[Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943]].''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Where a contract is rescinded due to a vitiating factor (e.g., mistake; undue influence);
* Where a contract is void ''ab initio.''&lt;ref&gt;This category of case is vividly illustrated by the [[Local authorities swaps litigation|Local Authorities Swaps Litigation of the 1990s]].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clist impossibility}}

===Mistake===
{{main article|Mistake in English contract law}}A benefit conferred upon another whilst labouring under a qualifying mistake gives rise to a ''prima facie'' claim for restitution of the benefit. Where one person pays money to another whilst labouring under a causative mistake of fact or law, he or she may be entitled to restitution on the ground of mistake. Restitution for a mistaken payment is widely regarded as the paradigm case of restitution for unjust enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;See Birks, ''Unjust Enrichment'' (2nd ed, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Background ====
Historically, the law took a highly restrictive approach to recovery for mistake. First, the law only recognised mistakes which related to a matter of fact, rather than law.&lt;ref&gt;''Bilbie v Lumley'' (1802) 2 East 469&lt;/ref&gt; This rule was judicially abandoned in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;''Kleinwort Benson v Lincoln City Council'' [1999] 2 AC 349&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the mistake had to be a "supposed liability" mistake.&lt;ref&gt;''Kelly v Solari'' (1841) 9 M&amp;W 54; ''Aiken v Short'' (1856) 1 H&amp;N 210; but note cases like ''Larner v London'' [1949] 2 KB 683.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the claimant must have laboured under the belief that he or she was under a legal obligation to pay. This rule has also been abandoned,&lt;ref&gt;''Barclays Bank Ltd v WJ Simms &amp; Cooke'' [1980] QB 677.&lt;/ref&gt; though the implications of this remain unsettled.{{Clist mistakes}}

==== Claims in respect of non-money benefits ====
The prevailing academic view&lt;ref&gt;Graham Virgo, ''The Principles of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2015) at 125-6; Mitchell, Mitchell, Watterson, eds., ''Goff &amp; Jones' Law of Unjust Enrichment'' (8th ed, 2011) at [9-02].&lt;/ref&gt; (for which there is some support in the cases)&lt;ref&gt;''Craven-Ellis v Canons Ltd'' [1936] 2 KB 403; ''Rover International Ltd v Cannon Film Sales Ltd (No 3)'' [1989] 1 WLR 912; ''Greenwood v Bennett'' [1973] QB 195; ''Marshall v Marshall'' [1999] 1 Qd R 173; cf. {{cite AustLII|HCA|27|2008|litigants=Lumbers v Cook Builders |parallelcite=(2008) 232 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 635}} (strong emphasis by the High Court of Australia on the need for a request in a quantum meruit claim).&lt;/ref&gt; is that mistake can be a ground of restitution for services.

===Legal compulsion===
Legal compulsion is a proposed ground of restitution. It is said to explain the law relating to recoupment and contribution.
* ''Recoupment.'' Where one person discharges the debt of another, he or she may be able to sue the debtor and thereby recoup the loss. Historically, this was a [[quasi-contract]]ual action known as an action for money paid, laid out and expended to the defendant's use.&lt;ref&gt;''Exall v Partridge'' (1799) 101 ER 1405; for a modern example, see ''Owen v Tate'' [1976] 1 QB 402&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Contribution''. Where two persons bear a co-ordinate liability, they must share the burden pro rata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|55|1969|litigants=Albion Insurance v Government Insurance Office of NSW |parallelcite=(1969) 121 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 342 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, where A and B are both under a common liability to pay C, and A pays this debt, A can claim contribution from C. Historically, this would be a suit in [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] (or in the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]]) and is accordingly an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] claim.&lt;ref&gt;''Dering v Earl of Winchelsea'' (1787) 29 ER 1184&lt;/ref&gt; Some rights of contribution are now governed by statute.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the ''Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978''&lt;/ref&gt;
Whether such claims are capable of being rationalised on the ground of unjust enrichment remains a controversial question.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Jonathan Hilliard, 'A Case for the Abolition of Legal Compulsion as a Ground of Restitution' (2002) 61 ''Cambridge Law Journal'' 551&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC]]'' [1992] 2 AC 1. Banks paid councils a lump sum (for Islington, £2.5m). The councils then paid the banks back at the prevailing interest rate. Banks paid councils back a fixed interest rate (this is the swap part). The point was that councils were gambling on what interest rates would do. So if interest rates fell, the councils would win. As it happened, interest rates were going up and the banks were winning. Islington was due to pay £1,354,474, but after Hazell, it refused, and waited to see what the courts said. At first instance Hobhouse J said that because the contract for the swap scheme was void, the council had been unjustly enriched with the lump sum (£2.5m) and it should have to pay [[compound interest]] (lots) rather than simple interest (lots, but not so much). But luckily for local government, three law Lords held that Islington only needed to repay with simple interest. There was no jurisdiction for compound interest. They said this was because there was no ‘resulting trust’.
*''[[Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC]]'' [1996] AC 669, the council had no authority to enter into a complex swap transaction with the German bank. So the House of Lords held that the council should repay the money they had been lent and a hitherto unknown ‘unjust’ factor was added to the list. Birks argued that the better explanation in all cases is an ‘absence of basis’ for the transfer of property. Searching through or adding to a list of open ended unjust factors simply concludes on grounds of what one wishes to prove, grounds that ‘would have to be constantly massaged to ensure that they dictated an answer as stable as is reached by the shorter ‘non basis’ route.’ (Birks (2005) 113)

*''[[Deutsche Morgan Grenfell plc v IRC]]'' [2006] UKHL 49 at [26] Money was paid as tax under a statutory regime, which the ECJ later held to have infringed the EC Treaty. The House of Lords held that a claim could be made on grounds of a ‘mistake as to the law’. [[Professor Charles Mitchell]] prefers the reasoning of Park J at first instance, which recognised that there is not really a ‘mistake’ in terms of an ‘impairment of a claimant's actual thought processes’. Lord Hoffmann recognised it only implicitly at [32].

==Remedy: personal and proprietary restitution==
{{Clist tracing}}
{{see also|Tracing in English law}}If a claimant can establish that the defendant has been enriched at the claimant's expense in circumstances which are unjust, the claimant has a prima facie right to restitution. The question then becomes whether the claimant is entitled to a personal or a proprietary remedy.

Historically, the ''indebitatus'' counts only afforded a personal remedy. Hence where the claimant's action would have been brought as an action for money had and received, for money paid, or as a quantum meruit or quantum valebat, the claimant is only entitled to a money award. In short, an action for restitution of unjust enrichment only generates a ''personal'' liability: the claimant has no proprietary interest in any specific asset of the defendant.

Academic writers have sought to expand the explanatory power of 'unjust enrichment'. To this end, writers have suggested that the doctrine of [[subrogation]] forms part of the law of unjust enrichment. If correct, this would be an instance of unjust enrichment generating a proprietary remedy. English courts have accepted that the concept of unjust enrichment has a role to play in subrogation.&lt;ref name="2015 UKSC 66"/&gt; The English approach has been stridently rejected by the High Court of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|44|2009|litigants=Bofinger v Kingsway |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic writers such as [[Peter Birks|Professor Birks]] and [[Andrew Burrows|Professor Burrows]] have argued that claims to the traceable substitute of one's property are claims in unjust enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Andrew Burrows, ''The Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2011); Graham Virgo, ''The Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2015); Mitchell et al, ''Goff &amp; Jones The Law of Unjust Enrichment'' (8th ed, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been rejected by the House of Lords.&lt;ref name="2015 UKSC 66"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Foskett v McKeown|Foskett v McKeown [2001]]].&lt;/ref&gt; They instead held that such claims were a matter of vindicating property rights, a view long associated with [[Graham Virgo|Professor Virgo]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham Virgo, ''The Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Even if not (for the foreseeable future) a part of the law of unjust enrichment, a claim to the traceable proceeds of one's property remains part of the law of restitution. The remainder of this section concerns proprietary restitution. Proprietary restitution is where a claimant who is entitled to restitution is awarded a proprietary remedy.

'''Enviroboard''' is a paper-like or cardboard-like construction and packaging material, generally manufactured using compressed, ecologically safe, agricultural material. Most often this means employing the use of high-[[cellulose]] waste fibres, such as the post-harvest straw of rice, barley, wheat, and [[elephant grass]] or alternatively, a more urban waste stream such as newspaper fibre.

Construction panels built from agricultural wastes have been around for hundreds of years, especially in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] where pressed leaves and straw were used as insulation and even structural material. Environmental board panels should not be confused with [[straw bale construction]] which does not process waste fibres into a compressed standardized board panel.

The concept of environmental construction panels dovetails with the principles of sustainability, namely reducing the impact that the entire life-cycle of constructing ''built environments'' has on the environment.

The Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud charges against Enviroboard on 29 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2016/comp-pr2016-170.pdf|title=Securities and Exchange Commission 2016|website=SEC.gov|access-date=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gun laws by country}}
[[Firearm]]s in [[Ireland]] are strictly controlled, both with strict legislation governing licensing and very conservative application of that legislation by the [[Gardaí]] (Irish Police). The legislation is quite difficult to follow because of the multiple overlapping Firearms Acts that define it, however the core principles are reasonably straightforward, requiring all firearms to be licensed individually and each applicant to have a good reason for having the firearm, a safe place in which to use it, a secure place in which to store it and to be of sound mind and temperate habits. 

The Firearms Act, 1925 states that a legal licence is required by law to own or possess a firearm in the Irish Republic. Failure to adhere to the law may result in a monetary fines or imprisonment and can result in firearms being seized by An Gárda Síochána. The Firearms Act, 1925 also lists a number of groups which are prohibited from legally owning a firearm, these include those suffering from mental health issues, those under the age of fifteen years and those who are under the supervision of the police &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1925/act/17/enacted/en/print.html|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|last=(eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gun crime is rising steadily in Ireland as a result of the illicit drugs trade; this has resulted in extensive tightening of licensing legislation during the last decade over the protests of the shooting sports organisations.

With the exception of the recent rise in gun crime, politics in Ireland has not concerned itself very much with firearms since the [[Belfast Agreement]]. Firearms do not have widespread visibility in most of Irish life outside farming and the shooting sports.

There are a wide range of shooting sports in Ireland and a somewhat confusing array of shooting sports organisational bodies. The main entry points to the shooting sports remain family, college clubs and the Irish Pony Club (who run a tetrathlon event that involves shooting). Newer entry points including corporate shooting events and "tryout days" for events like Modern Pentathlon have appeared in recent years but have not yet eclipsed the more established channels.

==Overview of Law==
There is no [[right to own firearms]] in Ireland.

Firearms generally require a firearms certificate (commonly referred to as a licence) in Ireland, though several exceptions to this (such as couriers transporting firearms or people shooting at authorised fairground stalls or shooting ranges with club-owned firearms) are specified in sections 2(3) and 2(4) of the Firearms Act. To obtain a firearms certificate, applicants file a form with either their local Garda Superintendent (for unrestricted firearms) or to their local Garda Chief Superintendent (for restricted firearms). Once presented, the licensing person has three months in which to issue a grant or refusal of the certificate. If the licensing person does not communicate a decision to the applicant within the three months, the applicant is deemed to have been informed of a refusal. If a licence is refused, the applicant may appeal the decision to the local District Court, who are the final authority for licensing (while a District Court's decision may be appealed, the District Court itself must overturn the licensing person's decision should the appeal be successful). The certificate lasts three years from the date of issue.

== Licensing ==

=== General requirements ===
The requirements the applicant must meet are set forth in section 4 of the Firearms Act and include, amongst others:
* A good reason for wanting the firearm. Hunting and target shooting qualify as do certain other activities like humane dispatch of large animals. Personal protection does not qualify as a good reason.
* A safe location in which to use the firearm (for target shooting, this must be an authorised shooting range which you must be a member of and which must maintain attendance records for the applicant and which must inform the Gardaí should the applicant's membership end).
* The details of the secure storage arrangements for the firearm (which must be inspected by the local Crime Prevention Officer. Minimum standards for secure storage are set out in the ''Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 2009'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/si/0307.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and increase according to the number and type of firearms being stored, but higher standards can be demanded by the Gardaí before issuing a licence.
* That granting the certificate would not result in a danger to the public or to the peace.
* Proof of competency with the firearm or the arrangements to achieve that competency, which are met by prior experience with the firearm, membership of a club where training will be provided, or completion of a training course (however no standard for such a training course has been set and so applicants are strongly advised to check with their local Garda Superintendent or Chief Superintendent (depending on which is being applied to) as to what courses they will accept).
* Permission for the Gardaí to access the applicants medical records.
* Two character references.
* If the firearm is a restricted firearm, the applicant must demonstrate that the firearm is the only type of firearm that is appropriate for the purpose for which it is required.
* Practical and dynamic shooting (defined as ''"any form of activity in which firearms are used to simulate combat or combat training"'' under the law but applying in practice to [[International Practical Shooting Confederation|IPSC]] and [[International Defensive Pistol Association|IDPA]] shooting) is banned in Ireland under section 4C of the Firearms Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0028/print.html#sec33}}&lt;/ref&gt; except for when carried out with airsoft replicas.

=== Eligibility ===
Not everyone is eligible to apply for a firearms certificate; those not eligible to apply are set out in Section 8 of the Firearms Act and include:
* anyone under 16 years of age
* anyone of "unsound mind" or "intemperate habits"
* anyone not resident in Ireland for six months before the application
* anyone convicted of certain specified offences

=== Licensable guns ===
The kinds of firearms which can be licensed in Ireland are governed by several different sections of law. EU law supersedes Irish law, but EU standards are far more relaxed than Irish ones so by and large the EU regulations do not come to the fore, except in the case of Category A firearms (the EU classification for automatic firearms) which are not licensable without direct permission from the Minister (which has never been given).

Irish law has four categories for firearms:
* Not a firearm (a category which applies to airsoft replicas as well as the obvious cases like children's toys)
* Unrestricted firearm
* Restricted firearm
* Prohibited firearm

Airsoft replicas were only removed from the firearms category with the 2006 firearms act; prior to that there was no lower muzzle energy limit before an item was classifiable as a firearm. This created the unusual situation where the laws applying to everything from a Nerf dart gun to a 20mm anti-tank rifle were identical. Following 2006, a lower muzzle energy limit for airguns of 1 Joule was introduced (in contrast to the European norm of 7.5 Joules and the UK limit of 16.27 Joules (12 foot-pounds) for air rifles and 8.13 Joules (6 foot-pounds) for air pistols). Paintball markers remain legally classified as firearms in Ireland.

Prohibited firearms are defined in Section 1 of the firearms act as  ''any weapon of whatever description designed for the discharge of any noxious liquid, noxious gas or other noxious thing, and also any ammunition (whether for any such weapon or any other weapon) which contains or is designed or adapted to contain any noxious liquid, noxious gas or other noxious thing''; this is interpreted to include devices such as pepper spray.

Differentiation between Unrestricted and Restricted Firearms categories is done in the Firearms (Restricted Firearms and Ammunition) Order 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2008/en/si/0021.html Firearms (Restricted Firearms and Ammunition) Order 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Firearms (Restricted Firearms and Ammunition) (Amendment) Order 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/si/0337.html Firearms (Restricted Firearms and Ammunition) (Amendment) Order 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The differentiation between Unrestricted and Restricted firearms was done by creating a list of unrestricted firearms and deeming all other firearms to be restricted. This has led to some legislative oversights of note; for example, crossbows are legally restricted firearms in Ireland because at the time of the drafting of these Orders, nobody remembered to add them to the list of unrestricted firearms (crossbows were added to the category of firearms in Irish law with the 1990 firearms act, other forms of bow are not legally firearms in Ireland). Also, the majority of paintball markers are legally classified as Short Restricted Firearms in Ireland and as such cannot be legally licensed following the 2009 firearms act (and strictly speaking, significant jail sentences and fines could result from a prosecution).

It must also be borne in mind that the licensing person, whether that is the local Superintendent or the local Chief Superintendent, have significant powers in law with regard to licensing decisions and may impose preconditions he or she requires of an applicant before granting a licence so long as such preconditions are imposed on a case-by-case basis (blanket preconditions having been deemed beyond the legal authority of the licensing person by the Supreme Court &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.ie/__80256F2B00356A6B.nsf/0/31682B4761BEDD2680256CD7001E266C?Open&amp;Highlight=0,firearms,~language_en~ Dunne-v-Donohue]&lt;/ref&gt;). The local Superintendent and local Chief Superintendent also have wide-ranging powers to revoke firearms certificates.

* Modifications to firearms could potentially render a firearms certificate null and void, and some modifications - such as reducing barrel length in rifles and shotguns below certain limits - are banned by law.

The Legal firearms are
* [[.22 LR]] single-shot and semi-automatic pistols and .177 air pistols may be licensed if they conform to the relevant [[International Olympic Committee]] regulations and if they also meet minimum barrel and overall length requirements and maximum magazine capacity requirements.
* All other pistols, unless they were licensed before 17 November 2008, may not be licensed; even if a Garda Superintendent or Chief Superintendent were willing to grant such a certificate, statute law prohibits it and such a certificate would be null and void. However other pistols which were licensed before this date may continue to be licensed by their original owners. The licences may not be transferred to other people, however.
* All non-automatic rifles may be licensed. Whether a restricted or unrestricted licence is required varies according to caliber, design, magazine capacity, general appearance and other factors.
* All non-automatic shotguns may be licensed. Whether a restricted or unrestricted licence is required varies according to caliber, design, magazine capacity, general appearance and other factors. It should be noted that it is possible to obtain a firearms certificate for an unrestricted firearm for a shotgun and then breach the terms of that certificate by loading restricted ammunition (such as solid slugs) into the shotgun; such an offence renders the firearms certificate null and void and exposes the licensed owner to extensive penalties up to and including seven years in prison and twenty thousand euro in fines. Care to avoid this is required.
* Suppressors (also referred to as silencers or sound moderators in Ireland) may be licensed; these are legally classed as firearms in and of themselves but are usually dealt with by authorisations on a firearms certificate (signified by a capital 'S' printed on the certificate itself) rather than a separate licence.
* Crossbows may be licensed as restricted firearms; other kinds of bow do not require a licence. 
* Night vision and thermal imaging sights are classified as firearms in Irish law if they are made to be attached to a firearm (hand-held versions of such devices are not controlled). These are usually dealt with by authorisations on a firearms certificate as with suppressors, but are extremely rare due to expense and effectiveness for civilian purposes. 
* Starting pistols and blank firing firearms also require a firearms licence to own in Ireland; generally however they are dealt with using authorisations from the local Superintendent instead of a firearms certificate 
* Stun guns of all kinds require a firearms licence to own in Ireland; as self-defence is not a Good Reason for application under the Commissioner's Guidelines, it would be very unlikely for such an application to succeed.

== Authorisation of shooting ranges ==
Shooting ranges in Ireland must be granted both planning permission by the local county council and an authorisation under section 2(5) of the Firearms Act by the local Garda Superintendent. Since the 2009 firearms act, most shooting ranges are required by their local Superintendent to be inspected and certified by the Firearms Range Inspector under section 4A of the Firearms Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/si/0308.html Firearms (Authorisation of Rifle or Pistol Clubs) Regulations 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Firearms Range Inspector is empowered by law to enter and search any place, building, dwelling or vehicle in Ireland if he suspects that target shooting is taking place at an unauthorised location.

== Statistics ==
Unlike the UK system where a licence applies to a person and can list multiple firearms, in Ireland a firearms certificate applies to a specific firearm and not the person holding them, so owning several firearms requires several firearms certificates. This has complicated firearms statistics gathering; there is no publicly available figure for the total number of firearms owners in Ireland, for example. Prior to the computerisation of records in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2005062900230?opendocument}}&lt;/ref&gt; it would have required searching and comparing through over 220,000 paper records by hand to determine this figure; requests for this number made through Written Questions in the Dáil since 2003 have received the reply that it would take a disproportionate amount of manpower to discover the number &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1996022000174?opendocument#}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Detailed statistics on makes, models and types of firearm beyond the rifle/pistol/shotgun and restricted/unrestricted categorisation are not generally maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2004121400232?opendocument}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Firearms Legislation in Ireland ==
Irish firearms law is based on several Firearms Acts, each of which amends those Acts which were issued previously. The initial Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1924&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/plweb-cgi/fastweb?state_id=1231429026&amp;view=ag-view&amp;docrank=8&amp;numhitsfound=9&amp;query_rule=%28%28$query3%29%29%3Alegtitle&amp;query3=firearms&amp;docid=1148&amp;docdb=Acts&amp;dbname=Acts&amp;sorting=none&amp;operator=and&amp;TemplateName=predoc.tmpl&amp;setCookie=1 |title=Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1924 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=5 April 1924 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was introduced as emergency legislation following the founding of the state, was replaced by the Firearms Act, 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/plweb-cgi/fastweb?state_id=1231429131&amp;view=ag-view&amp;docrank=6&amp;numhitsfound=9&amp;query_rule=%28%28$query3%29%29%3Alegtitle&amp;query3=firearms&amp;docid=2386&amp;docdb=Acts&amp;dbname=Acts&amp;sorting=none&amp;operator=and&amp;TemplateName=predoc.tmpl&amp;setCookie=1 |title=Firearms Act, 1925 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=6 June 1925 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which laid the foundations of the system of licensing that has continued unaltered until quite recently. Relatively small modifications were introduced in the Firearms Act, 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/plweb-cgi/fastweb?state_id=1231429131&amp;view=ag-view&amp;docrank=5&amp;numhitsfound=9&amp;query_rule=%28%28$query3%29%29%3Alegtitle&amp;query3=firearms&amp;docid=29369&amp;docdb=Acts&amp;dbname=Acts&amp;sorting=none&amp;operator=and&amp;TemplateName=predoc.tmpl&amp;setCookie=1 |title=Firearms Act, 1964 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=28 January 1964 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Firearms (Proofing) Act, 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/plweb-cgi/fastweb?state_id=1231429026&amp;view=ag-view&amp;docrank=4&amp;numhitsfound=9&amp;query_rule=%28%28$query3%29%29%3Alegtitle&amp;query3=firearms&amp;docid=32544&amp;docdb=Acts&amp;dbname=Acts&amp;sorting=none&amp;operator=and&amp;TemplateName=predoc.tmpl&amp;setCookie=1 |title=Firearms (Proofing) Act, 1968 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=3 July 1968 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Firearms Act, 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/plweb-cgi/fastweb?state_id=1231429131&amp;view=ag-view&amp;docrank=3&amp;numhitsfound=9&amp;query_rule=%28%28$query3%29%29%3Alegtitle&amp;query3=firearms&amp;docid=33764&amp;docdb=Acts&amp;dbname=Acts&amp;sorting=none&amp;operator=and&amp;TemplateName=predoc.tmpl&amp;setCookie=1 |title=Firearms Act, 1971 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=6 July 1971 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/plweb-cgi/fastweb?state_id=1231429131&amp;view=ag-view&amp;docrank=2&amp;numhitsfound=9&amp;query_rule=%28%28$query3%29%29%3Alegtitle&amp;query3=firearms&amp;docid=45965&amp;docdb=Acts&amp;dbname=Acts&amp;sorting=none&amp;operator=and&amp;TemplateName=predoc.tmpl&amp;setCookie=1 |title=Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=12 June 1990 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/plweb-cgi/fastweb?state_id=1231429131&amp;view=ag-view&amp;docrank=1&amp;numhitsfound=9&amp;query_rule=%28%28$query3%29%29%3Alegtitle&amp;query3=firearms&amp;docid=57046&amp;docdb=Acts&amp;dbname=Acts&amp;sorting=none&amp;operator=and&amp;TemplateName=predoc.tmpl&amp;setCookie=1 |title=Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1998 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=13 July 1998 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Firearms (Firearm Certificates For Non-Residents) Act, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/plweb-cgi/fastweb?state_id=1231429011&amp;view=ag-view&amp;numhitsfound=1&amp;query_rule=%28%28$query3%29%29%3Alegtitle&amp;query3=firearm&amp;docid=59427&amp;docdb=Acts&amp;dbname=Acts&amp;sorting=none&amp;operator=and&amp;TemplateName=predoc.tmpl&amp;setCookie=1 |title=Firearms (Firearm Certificates For Non-Residents) Act, 2000 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=5 July 2000 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, such was the confusion from these multiple Acts, each amending the others (and not all of which were ever actually commenced and thus were in the public record but not enforced as actual legislation); and the amendments of Irish firearms legislation by other Acts ranging from the Wildlife Acts (mostly relating to hunting law) to the Road Traffic Acts (relating to how and where firearms could be transported) and others; the large amount of secondary legislation (Statutory Instruments, which set out regulations, the design of application forms for licences and so forth, as well as the details of when various parts of the Acts came into force); as well as the introduction of EU firearms law into the canon of Irish legislation; led the Irish Law Reform Commission to recommend that all the extant legislation be ''restated''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawreform.ie/news/report-on-legislation-directory-and-consultation-paper-on-classified-list-of-legislation-in-ireland.339.html |title=recommend that all the extant legislation be '&amp;#39;restated'&amp;#39; |publisher=Lawreform.ie |accessdate=14 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207172508/http://www.lawreform.ie/news/report-on-legislation-directory-and-consultation-paper-on-classified-list-of-legislation-in-ireland.339.html |archivedate=7 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a legal process by which all the existing primary and secondary legislation would be read as one and a single document produced as the new Firearms Act (and all prior Acts would be repealed).

The introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 2006,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/index.html |title=Criminal Justice Act 2006 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=16 July 2006 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contained an enormous rewrite of the Firearms Act, rewriting almost 80% of the Act completely. It was quickly followed by the Criminal Justice Act 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/plweb-cgi/fastweb?state_id=1231429272&amp;view=ag-view&amp;numhitsfound=1&amp;query_rule=%28%28$query3%29%29%3Alegtitle&amp;query3=criminal%20justice%20act%202007&amp;docid=71265&amp;docdb=Acts&amp;dbname=Acts&amp;dbname=SIs&amp;sorting=none&amp;operator=and&amp;TemplateName=predoc.tmpl&amp;setCookie=1 |title=Criminal Justice Act 2007 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=30 May 2006 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0028/index.html |title=Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of which amended all the preceding Firearms Acts. As of 2011, the Law Reform Commission recommendation still stands and has not as yet been acted upon; the Firearms Act consists of the initial 1925 Act amended by approximately eighteen separate Acts and is well understood by only a handful of those directly involved in its drafting, amendment or usage. Extensive complaints have arisen over the application of the legislation, with over seventy successfully prosecuted in the High Court by firearms owners by 2011. How much of this is due to the overly complicated nature of the legislation involved and the lack of formal training provided to Garda Superintendents in that legislation is unknown, but all of the cases which have been brought to court to date hinged on misinterpretations of the firearms act by one party or the other, and in one such case - [http://www.courts.ie/__80256F2B00356A6B.nsf/0/4F58C462F8E4BC248025747C002CF6BD?Open&amp;Highlight=0,firearms,~language_en~ McCarron-v-Kearney], the presiding judge stated ''I feel it necessary to add, however, that the piecemeal spreading over multiple pieces of legislation of the statutory rules for the control of firearms is undesirable. Codification in that area is almost as pressing a need as it is in the area of sexual violence.''

Over 168 judicial review cases were taken to the High Court between 2010 and 2013 in a protracted series of legal proceedings all relating to disputed licensing decisions. Three of these cases were taken as "test cases" by the Department of Justice (Irish court rules [http://www.mcgarrsolicitors.ie/2008/03/31/class-actions/ do not permit class action suits] and so each case had to be considered separately), and policy with regard to firearms licences was to be determined based on the outcome of these cases, according to the Ministerial Briefing document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/min_brief_mar2011 |title=Ministerial Briefing document |publisher=Justice.ie |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the newly elected Minister for Justice, Alan Shatter. In one of these three cases, it was discovered that a senior Garda officer had modified the application forms after the legal proceedings had begun; as a result all 168 cases were settled out of court.

The Minister retains the authority in law to issue a [[Temporary Custody Order]], which compels all firearms certificate holders to turn their firearms over to the [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] for a period of up to three months.

Target shooting outside an authorised range in Ireland is a criminal offence. However the law does not contain a definition of target shooting, and thus certain activities (such as hunters zeroing rifles before hunting) technically breach this law but in practice the law is not enforced in these specific cases.

==1972 Temporary Custody Order and Pistols in Irish firearms law==
One of the most controversial events in the history of the Firearms Acts occurred in 1972. [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] (1970–1998) were becoming a security concern for the Irish government at the time, and in 1972 a Temporary Custody Order (S.I. No. 187/1972 – Firearms (Temporary Custody) Order, 1972)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/plweb-cgi/fastweb?state_id=1306691152&amp;view=ag-view&amp;numhitsfound=1&amp;query_rule=%28%28$query3%29%29%3Alegtitle&amp;query3=temporary%20custody%20order%201972&amp;docid=12459&amp;docdb=SIs&amp;dbname=SIs&amp;sorting=none&amp;operator=and&amp;TemplateName=predoc.tmpl&amp;setCookie=1 |title=S.I. No. 187/1972 – Firearms (Temporary Custody) Order, 1972 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=5 August 1972 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was issued for all privately held [[pistols]] and all [[rifles]] over [[.22 Long Rifle|.22]] [[caliber|calibre]] to be surrendered to local [[Garda Síochána]] (police) stations by 5 August 1972, for a period of one month. This order was complied with, but when firearms owners returned to reclaim their firearms, they were informed that their licences had expired while their firearms were in custody (Irish firearms licences until 2008 were issued for a period of one year, and all licences were usually dealt with at the same time, usually at the start of August, though the date has changed over the years). Since the firearms were no longer licensed, they could not be returned until a new licence was issued; upon seeking a renewal of their licences, applicants were informed that a new Garda policy was in place that would refuse licence applications for all pistols and all firearms over .22 in calibre. As such, the firearms in Garda custody remained in Garda custody.

This situation continued until the late 1990s, when [[Fullbore target rifle|fullbore rifles]] of calibres up to [[.270 Winchester]] were permitted to be licensed for the purposes of [[deer]] hunting on humane grounds (prior to this, only the [[.22-250 Remington|.22–250 cartridge]] was available for deer hunting and it was felt to be only barely capable of this task). All other firearms held in custody remained there, until the repeal of the Garda policy following a high court case in 2004 taken by Irish shooter Frank Brophy to obtain a licence for an Olympic target shooting pistol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/refusal-to-grant-firearms-permit-is-quashed-1.1147174}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeded and the licence was granted. Following this, firearms held in storage by the Gardaí were reclaimed by those owners still alive or their descendants. As these pistols were never formally confiscated (and some were sold off by their owners and removed from Garda custody in that manner), no compensation was claimable by the owners.

Following the Brophy case, some 300 pistols were licensed in Ireland, ranging from new Olympic air pistols (which are firearms under Irish law) to reclaimed pre-1972 pistols to new centerfire pistols. While welcomed by the target shooting community, in 2008 opposition deputies Jim Deasy and [[Olivia Mitchell]] campaigned to ban these pistols on the grounds that they could be used in crime. Despite multiple parliamentary questions from as early as 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2005-01-27.938.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2009-09-22.546.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/debates/?id=2009-05-27.399.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2009-04-22.839.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2008-12-03.1412.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was stated that there was no proof that this was happening, Minister Ahern announced a ban on all handguns in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1118/surveillance.html |title=November 2008 |publisher=RTÉ.ie |date=18 November 2008 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ban was fought by the various governing bodies of shooting sports in Ireland, with the end result as of 2011 that [[air pistol|air]] and small-bore pistols may still be licensed in Ireland, but all [[Centerfire ammunition|centerfire]] pistols not licensed prior to 17 November 2008 cannot be licensed.

==The Firearms Consultation Panel==
Following the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 2006&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and its extensive and complex rewriting of the Firearms Act, the Minister for Justice at the time ([[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]]) instituted the Firearms Consultation Panel, a panel chaired by the Minister through the Principal Officer of the [[Department of Justice and Equality|Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform]]'s Firearms Section, which comprised representatives from the Gardaí, Department of Sport, firearms dealers, all the national governing bodies of the shooting sports, and other stakeholders in the Firearms Act (such as [[insurance]] providers). This panel met from 2006 through 2011 to attempt to implement the changes in the 2006 Act (and later the 2007 and 2009 Acts) where possible, and to attempt to alter the Acts where they were unworkable by providing expert advice to the Department in the drafting of new legislation amendments. With the election of a new Minister, the FCP is in the process of being wound down, despite campaigning to extend its terms of reference to make it a permanent advisory panel.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}
This article aims to describe the extent of [[Business operations|operations]] and processes of [[government]]s around the world at all levels. 

==Size of economic footprint==

{{Main|Government ownership|Government spending}}

The scale to which government should exist and operate in the world is a matter of debate. Government spending in [[developed countries]] varies considerably but generally makes up between about 30% and 70% of their [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].  One major exception is the United States, where central government spending takes up less than 20% of GDP, although the combined spending of all administrations reach 36%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Services==
Government agencies may produce [[Public services|services]] like:
*[[Telecommunications|Communications]]
*[[Education]] (e.g. [[community college]])
*[[Emergency services]]
*[[Entertainment]] (e.g. [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]])
*[[Entitlements]]
*[[Financial services]]
*[[Financing]]
*[[Fire fighting]]
*[[Healthcare]]
*[[Insurance]]
*[[Law]] (e.g. [[Legislation|legislative]], [[Judiciary|judicial]], and [[Administrative law|regulatory activities]])
*[[Law enforcement]]
*[[Police]]
*[[Defense (military)|Defense]] and [[armed forces]]
*[[Mail|Postal service]]
*[[Transport]] (e.g. [[government transportation]])
*[[Counterintelligence]] and [[anti-terrorism]] services

==Goods==
Government agencies may produce [[good (accounting)|goods]] like:
*[[Coal]]
*[[Electrical infrastructure]]
*[[Oil]] (e.g. [[Pemex]])
*[[Roads]], [[bridge]]s, [[tunnels]]
*[[sanitary sewer|Sewers]]
*[[Steel]]
*[[Water infrastructure]]

==Local government==
{{globalize|date=December 2010}}
At the level of [[local government]], territorial or other authorities may set up government corporations such as "[[Local Authority Trading Enterprise]]s" (LATEs).

==Commonwealth of Nations==
{{see also|Crown corporation|State-owned enterprises of New Zealand}}

In monarchical [[Commonwealth of Nations|commonwealth]] countries country-wide government corporations often use the style "[[crown corporation]]". Notable exceptions include both the [[state-owned enterprises]] and the [[crown entities]] in [[New Zealand]]. Examples of crown corporations include the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) in [[Canada]] and [[Air Canada]] before it underwent privatisation. [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] ministers ([[ministers of the crown]]) often control the [[share (finance)|share]]s in such [[public corporations]].

==United Kingdom==
{{Main|United Kingdom budget}}

For partial government employment statistics, see [[List of largest United Kingdom employers]].

==United States==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
{{main|United States federal budget}}
In the [[United States]], businesses that are government owned include [[Amtrak]] and the [[United States Postal Service]]. Many [[U.S. state|states]] have government owned businesses for operations as well. Generally speaking, a [[statute]] passed by a legislature specifically sets up a government owned company in order to undertake a specific public purpose with public funds or public property.

For employment statistics, see [[List of largest employers in the United States]].

==Privatization==
{{Main|privatization}}
Privatization is the transfer of ownership from the [[public sector]] (government) to the [[private sector]] (business).

The '''HIV Organ Policy Equity Act''' (the '''HOPE Act''') is a law that modifies rules regarding [[organ donation]] between HIV-positive individuals. The law authorizes clinical research and the revision of rules about organ donation and transportation as a result of the research. Organs from HIV donors would only be going to individuals who are already HIV positive, but could lead to 600 additional organ transplants a year.&lt;ref name="opendoor1"/&gt; The use of HIV-positive organs was previously a federal crime.&lt;ref name="hrcAdvocacy1"/&gt;  This bill passed the [[United States Senate]] during the [[113th United States Congress]],&lt;ref name=senatepasses1&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Ramsey|title=Senate passes bill to allow research on organ transplants for HIV patients|url=http://64.147.104.60/blogs/floor-action/senate/306087-senate-passes-bill-to-allow-research-on-organ-transplants-for-hiv-patients|accessdate=11 November 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also passed the [[United States House of Representatives]].  It was signed into law as PL 113-51 by President [[Barack Obama]] on November 21, 2013.

==Background==
The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act revises the [[Organ Transplant Amendments Act of 1988]], a decades-old law that prevented patients from receiving organs from HIV positive people.&lt;ref name=opendoor1&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=Congress opens door to allowing HIV organ donation|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/healthcare/189820-congress-opens-door-to-allowing-hiv-organ-donations|accessdate=11 November 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today's HIV positive patients are healthy, live longer and many are in need to give and receive organ transplants.&lt;ref name="opendoor1"/&gt;  The changes proposed by the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act enables this, thus shortening organ transplant wait times.  This would also shorten the wait times for people without HIV as more HIV positive patients receive organs.&lt;ref name=hrcAdvocacy1&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOP) Act - Issue Federal Advocacy|url=http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-legislation/hiv-organ-policy-equity-hope-act|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=11 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203021650/http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-legislation/hiv-organ-policy-equity-hope-act|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=330sum&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 330 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/senate-bill/330|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act amends the Public Health Service Act to repeal the requirement that the [[Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network]] adopt and use standards of quality for the acquisition and transportation of [[organ donation|donated organs]] that include standards for preventing the acquisition of organs infected with the [[Etiology (medicine)|etiologic]] agent for [[HIV/AIDS|acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS).&lt;ref name="330sum"/&gt;

The bill replaces this requirement with authorization for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to adopt and use such standards with respect to organs infected with [[HIV/AIDS|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), provided that any such standards ensure that organs infected with HIV may be transplanted only into individuals who are: (1) infected with such virus before receiving such an organ; and (2) participating in [[clinical research]] approved by an institutional review board under the criteria, standards, and regulations regarding organs infected with HIV developed under this Act or, if participation in such research is no longer warranted, receiving a transplant under such standards and regulations.&lt;ref name="330sum"/&gt;

The bill would revise similarly the requirement that organ procurement organizations arrange for testing to prevent the acquisition of organs infected with the AIDS etiologic agent to require that they arrange for testing to identify organs infected with HIV.&lt;ref name="330sum"/&gt;

The bill directs the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to develop and publish guidelines for the conduct of research relating to transplantation of organs from HIV-infected donors.&lt;ref name="330sum"/&gt;

The bill also requires the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to revise its standards of quality regarding HIV-infected organs and the Secretary to revise related regulations.&lt;ref name="330sum"/&gt;

The bill requires the Secretary to: (1) review annually the results of scientific research in conjunction with the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to determine whether they warrant revision of quality standards relating to donated HIV-infected organs and to the safety of transplantation of organs with a particular strain of HIV into a recipient with a different strain; and (2) direct the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, if the review so warrants, to revise its standards in a way that ensures the changes will not reduce the safety of organ transplantation.&lt;ref name="330sum"/&gt;

Finally, the bill amends the [[United States Code|federal criminal code]] to declare that an organ donation does not violate the prohibition against a knowing organ donation by an HIV-infected individual if the donation is made in accordance with this Act.&lt;ref name="330sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on March 20, 2013. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo330&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - S. 330|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44266|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. 330 amends provisions of the [[Public Health Service Act]] that authorize the Secretary of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to establish guidelines and quality standards for conducting research relating to donated organs and for acquiring and procuring such organs.&lt;ref name="cbo330"/&gt;

The bill removes a provision in current law that prohibits the acquisition and procurement of donated organs that are infected with the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.&lt;ref name="cbo330"/&gt; S. 330 also requires the Secretary of HHS to develop guidelines for conducting research relating to organ transplants from donors who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The Secretary is required to annually review the results of the research to determine whether the results warrant revising the quality standards for acquiring and procuring donated organs. Finally, the bill authorizes the Secretary to establish standards for acquiring and procuring donated organs that are infected with HIV, provided that any such standards ensure that an organ infected with HIV may be transplanted only into individuals who are infected with HIV before receiving such organ.&lt;ref name="cbo330"/&gt;

To implement S. 330, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that HHS would incur administrative costs of less than $500,000 annually and about $1 million over the 2014-2018 period.&lt;ref name="cbo330"/&gt; Any such costs would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply to this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues.&lt;ref name="cbo330"/&gt;

The bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded mandate#Unfunded Mandates Reform Act|Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]].&lt;ref name="cbo330"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act was introduced into the Senate on February 14, 2013 by [[Barbara Boxer|Sen. Barbara Boxer (D, CA)]].&lt;ref name=330allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 330 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/330/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]]. On June 17, 2013, the Senate voted by [[unanimous consent]] to pass the bill.&lt;ref name="330allactions"/&gt;

The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act was received in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on June 18, 2013.&lt;ref name="330allactions"/&gt;  It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]], the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health]], the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]], and the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations]]. On November 8, 2013, House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] announced that the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act would be considered under a suspension of the rules on the House floor on November 12, 2013.&lt;ref name=majorityleader1&gt;{{cite web|title=Leader's Weekly Schedule - Week of November 11, 2013|url=http://majorityleader.gov/floor/11-11-13.pdf|publisher=House Majority Leader's Office|accessdate=11 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224006/http://majorityleader.gov/floor/11-11-13.pdf|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
The [[Human Rights Campaign]] was in favor of the bill.&lt;ref name="hrcAdvocacy1"/&gt;  According to the Human Rights Campaign, "the Act is supported by dozens of organizations that advocate on transplant policy and communities with an increased need for transplantation, including: AIDS United, amfAR, American Medical Association, American Society for Nephrology, Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, American Society of Transplantation, American Society of Transplant Surgeons, Dialysis Patient Citizens, HIV Medicine Association, and United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)."&lt;ref name="hrcAdvocacy1"/&gt;

The '''Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption''' (or '''Hague Adoption Convention''') is an international convention dealing with [[international adoption]], [[child laundering]], and [[child trafficking]] in an effort to protect those involved from the corruption, abuses, and exploitation which sometimes accompanies international adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Hague Conference on Private International Law]]|url=http://hcch.e-vision.nl/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=69|title=Text of Convention|date=7 December 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention has been considered crucial because it provides a formal international and intergovernmental recognition of intercountry adoption to ensure that adoptions under the Convention will generally be recognized and given effect in other party countries.

==Objectives==
The preamble to the Convention states:
:Intercountry adoptions shall be made in the best interests of the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights and to prevent the abduction [sic. should be "abduction of"], the sale of, or traffic in children and each State should take, as a matter of priority, appropriate measures to enable the child to remain in the care of his or her family of origin.

The main objectives of the Convention, are set out in Article 1:
*to establish safeguards to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights as recognized in international law,
*to establish a system of co-operation amongst Contracting States to ensure that those safeguards are respected and thereby prevent the abduction, the sale of, or traffic in children,
*to secure the recognition in Contracting States of adoptions made in accordance with the Convention.

==History==
The Convention was developed by the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]], the preeminent organization in the area of [[private international law]]. It was concluded on 29 May 1993 and entered into force on 1 May 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=69 Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Hague Conference on Private International Law]]|url=http://tierwriting.com/2010/03/about-hague-adoption-convention/|title=About Hague Adoption Convention|date=7 December 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2016, the Convention has been ratified by 96 states. [[South Korea]], [[Nepal]], and [[Russia]] have signed but not ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Hague Conference on Private International Law]]|url=http://hcch.e-vision.nl/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&amp;cid=69|title=Status Table|date=7 December 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries which have not ratified the Convention do not permit foreign adoptions of their children nor adoptions of foreign children.

==Policies and procedures==
With respect to the previous multilateral instruments which include some provisions regarding intercountry adoption, the Hague Adoption Convention is the major multilateral instrument regulating international adoption and calls for the need for co-ordination and direct co-operation between countries to ensure that appropriate safeguards are respected.

The Hague Adoption Convention has several requirements. The adoption process includes establishing a "Central Authority" to serve as the country's primary contact in adoption processes; satisfying several checks for a child eligible for adoption, including verifying the propriety of the adoption under the laws of both countries; and making a reasonable prior effort to facilitate a domestic adoption agreeing to use only certified adoption agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6fdff5c5-5635-4b5b-83cb-93a1591faf9c%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=3&amp;hid=125|title = Adopting the Stateless|last = Milbrandt|first = J|date = 2014|journal = Brooklynn Journal of International Law|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article III outlines the responsibilities that the entire process must be authorized by central adoption authorities designated by the contracting states. If fully implemented at the national level, the Convention offers a protective framework against the potential risks of private adoption (when the adoptive parents set the terms of the adoption directly with the biological parents or with children's institutions placed in the country of origin, without recurring to accredited adoption service providers).&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Lammerant, Marlène Hofstetter, "Adoption: at what cost? For an ethical responsibility of receiving countries in intercountry adoption", Terre des homes, 2007; HCCH 2008. The implementation and Operation of the 1993 Hague Intercountry Adoption Convention: Guide to Good Practice – Guide No. 1, Bristol: Family Law/Jordan Publishing Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Implementation and Operation of the 1993 Intercountry Adoption Convention: Guide to Good Practice'', prepared by HCCH, provides assistance to the operation, use and interpretation of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=publications.details&amp;pid=4388 ''The Implementation and Operation of the 1993 Intercountry Adoption Convention: Guide to Good Practice'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance==
To comply with international standards, many changes have been introduced in national legislation enacting laws to criminalize the act of obtaining improper gains from international adoptions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/adoption2010/child_adoption.pdf UNDP, Child Adoption. Trends and Policies Report, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; However, instances of trafficking in and sale of children for the purpose of adoption continue to take place in many parts of the world. In the fiscal year of 2006, the Department of State Office of Children's Issues assisted in the return to the United States of 260 children who had been abducted to or wrongfully retained from other countries and 171 children were returned from countries that are Convention partners with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/childabduction/child_abduction_Compliance_Report.pdf|title = Report on Compliance with the Hague Convention|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially during emergency situations, natural disasters or conflicts, children are observed to be adopted without strict legal procedures being followed, with a risk that there may be cases of child trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, "Second Periodic reports of States parties due in 1998, Rwanda (CRC/C/70/Add22)&lt;/ref&gt; An excessive bureaucratization of the adoption process after the implementation of the Hague Adoption Convention has been noted to establishing possible additional barriers to the placement of children.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Bartholet, International Adoption: Current Status and Future Prospects, 1993, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968''' applies to the Indian tribes of the United States and makes many, but not all, of the guarantees of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]  applicable within the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, "Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years," 34 ''IDAHO LAW REVIEW'' 465 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The Act appears today in Title 25, sections 1301 to 1303 of the United States Code.

The H.R. 2516 [[legislation]] was passed by the 90th U.S. Congressional session and endorsed by the 36th President of the United States Lyndon Johnson on April 11, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=28799 |title= Lyndon B. Johnson: "Remarks Upon Signing the Civil Rights Act.," April 11, 1968 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events before passage of ICRA ==
The US Supreme Court had made clear that tribal internal affairs concerning tribal members' individual rights were not covered by the Fifth Amendment to the US constitution. However, the tribes were ultimately subjected to the power of Congress and the Constitution.&lt;ref name=answers&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/topic/indian-civil-rights-act Indian Civil Rights Act]." US History Encyclopedia. © 2006 through a partnership of Answers Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; The court case ''[[Talton v. Mayes]]'' helped establish the principles. There were other court cases over the following years to continue the thoughts "that tribes were not arms of the federal government when punishing tribal members for criminal acts and that Indian tribes were exempt from many of the constitutional protections governing the actions of state and federal governments".&lt;ref name=answers /&gt;

Later, in the 1960s, Congress held a series of hearings on the subject of the authority of tribal governments. These hearings told about the abuses that many tribal members had endured from the "sometimes corrupt, incompetent, or tyrannical tribal officials". In response, the Indian Civil Rights Act was enacted.&lt;ref name=answers /&gt;

== Provisions of the Indian Civil Rights Act ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
No Indian tribe in exercising powers of self-government shall—
# make or enforce any law prohibiting the free exercise of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition for a redress of grievances;
# violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable search and seizures, nor issue warrants, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the person or thing to be seized;
# subject any person for the same offense to be [[Double jeopardy|twice put in jeopardy]];
# compel any person in any criminal case to be a witness against himself;
# take any private property for a public use without just compensation;
# deny to any person in a criminal proceeding the right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and at his own expense to have the assistance of counsel for his defense;
# require excessive bail, impose excessive fines, inflict cruel and unusual punishments, and in no event impose for conviction of any one offense any penalty or punishment greater than imprisonment for a term of one year and a fine of $5,000, or both;
# deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws or deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law;
# pass any [[bill of attainder]] or ex post facto law; or
# deny to any person accused of an offense punishable by imprisonment the right, upon request, to a trial by jury of not less than six persons.&lt;ref&gt;Canby Jr., William C. ''American Indian Law in a Nutshell''. St. Paul: West Publishing Co., 2004 pg. 354–355&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to the US Government Publishing Office, in "imprisonment for a term of one year and a fine of $5,000, or both" in paragraph 7, "and" should probably be "or".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?collectionCode=USCODE&amp;browsePath=Title+25%2FCHAPTER+15&amp;granuleId=USCODE-2009-title25-chap15&amp;packageId=USCODE-2009-title25&amp;collapse=true&amp;fromBrowse=true|title=25 U.S.C. 15 - Constitutional Rights of Indians|publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office]]|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act also requires tribal courts to afford due process and other civil liberties. Also, Native American courts try to provide a setting similar to that of a US courtroom, which is familiar to lawyers.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson /&gt; That aided the attorneys, and it helped divert non-Indian ridicule and established the view that tribal courts were legitimate courts. Tribal courts adopted rules of evidence, pleading, and other requirements similar to those in state and federal courts.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;Wilkinson, Charles. ''Blood Struggle: The Rise of Modern Indian Nations''. Boston: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Incorporated, 2006. pg. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRA incorporated many constitutional protections but it modified others or did not include them at all. "The law did not impose the establishment clause, the guarantee of a republican form of government, the requirement of a separation of church and state, the right to a jury trial in civil cases, or the right of indigents to appointed counsel in criminal cases."&lt;ref name=answers /&gt; The provisions were excluded because the government recognized the different political and cultural status of the tribes.

Even though the federal government respected their individuality in this respect, the establishment of the ICRA caused the tribal governments to "mirror" modern American courts and procedures.&lt;ref name=answers /&gt;

The impact of ICRA was greatly limited by the Supreme Court by the ''[[Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez]]'' court case (1978). ''Martinez'' involved a request to stop denying tribal membership to those children born to female (not male) tribal members who married outside of the tribe. The mother who brought the case pleaded that the discrimination against her child was solely based on sex, which violated the ICRA. The courts decided that "tribal common-law sovereign immunity prevented a suit against the tribe."&lt;ref name=answers /&gt; ''Martinez'' ultimately strengthened tribal self-determination by further proving that generally, the federal government played no enforcement role over the tribal governments.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Paul L. [http://www.answers.com/topic/santa-clara-pueblo-v-martinez ''Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Japan Australia Migratory Bird Agreement''' ('''JAMBA''') is a treaty between [[Australia]] and [[Japan]] to minimise harm to the major areas used by birds which migrate between the two countries.  JAMBA was first developed on February 6, 1974 and came into force on April 30, 1981.

JAMBA provides for cooperation between Japan and Australia on measures for the management and protection of migratory birds, birds in danger of extinction, and the management and protection of their environments, and requires each country to take appropriate measures to preserve and enhance the environment of birds protected under the provisions of the agreement.

==Background==

===Supreme Court case===
[[File:Justice White Official.jpg|thumb|[[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Byron White]] wrote the majority opinion]]
This form of plea is derived from the 1970 ruling by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in the case ''[[North Carolina v. Alford]]''.&lt;ref name="potts"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Potts  | first =Monica   | title =Alford plea a common method of resolving cases  | work =The Connecticut Post |location=[[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]  | date =October 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Alford of [[Forsyth County, North Carolina]] was indicted for [[first degree murder]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="ingram" /&gt;&lt;ref name="weigl" /&gt; At the time under [[North Carolina]] law a conviction of first degree murder automatically brought with it the [[death penalty]], unless the jury recommended otherwise, in which case the defendant would receive a mandatory life sentence.&lt;ref name="bothsides" /&gt;&lt;ref name="setplea"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Hogan  | first =Dick  | title =Supreme Court case set plea  | work =The Gazette|location=Cedar Rapids-Iowa City  | publisher =Cedar Rapids Gazette  | page =A19  | date =November 8, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alford said he was innocent, but the prosecution had significant evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="weigl" /&gt; Witnesses stated Alford had said he wanted to kill the victim, then grabbed his gun and left his residence.&lt;ref name="weigl" /&gt; Witnesses said that Alford subsequently declared he had killed the victim.&lt;ref name="weigl" /&gt; His defense advised Alford to plead to the crime of second degree murder because of the belief that the strong evidence would lead to a conviction.&lt;ref name="weigl" /&gt; He pleaded guilty to [[second degree murder]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="ingram"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Ingram  | first =David  | title =The Alford Plea  | work =The Charlotte Observer|location=[[Charlotte, North Carolina]]  | page =9A  | date =February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did so in order to avoid a possible [[death sentence]].&lt;ref name="ingram" /&gt; Alford maintained he was innocent of the crime itself, but feared going to trial because of the [[capital punishment]] associated with the charge of [[first degree murder]].&lt;ref name="lithwick"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Lithwick  | first =Dahlia   | title =Can You Plead Guilty and Maintain Your Innocence?  | work =Slate  | publisher =Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Co. LLC  | page =Section: Explainer  | date =November 5, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given a sentence of thirty years in jail.&lt;ref name="ingram" /&gt;

Alford appealed, and argued that his conviction for second degree murder should be overturned because he said the plea was coercive in nature.&lt;ref name="ford" /&gt; The matter came before the Supreme Court, and in its ruling the court said that the trial judge in Alford's criminal case was appropriate in having accepted the defendant's plea of guilty.&lt;ref name="ingram" /&gt; The Court said that the decision to plead guilty while maintaining his innocence was a reasonable choice for Alford to have made at the time.&lt;ref name="ford" /&gt; Supreme Court Justice [[Byron White]] wrote the majority opinion.&lt;ref name="ingram" /&gt; The Supreme Court case was decided 5–3.&lt;ref name="ingram" /&gt; "[T]hat he would not have pleaded except for the opportunity to limit the possible penalty does not necessarily demonstrate that the plea of guilty was not the product of a free and rational choice", said the Supreme Court decision.&lt;ref name="lithwick" /&gt; The Court ruled that a plea of guilty that was "a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action" was not a coercive decision.&lt;ref name="setplea" /&gt; Justice White wrote that, "Express admission of guilt is not constitutional requisite to imposition of criminal penalty."&lt;ref name="bothsides"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Susnjara  | first =Bob    | title =Alford plea often benefits both sides  | work =The News-Sun|location=[[Waukegan, Illinois]]  | page =A2  | date =August 15, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Alford died while in jail at the age of 57.&lt;ref name="weigl" /&gt;

===Usage of plea===
When a defendant indicates an intention to plead guilty by Alford plea, the judge asks two questions: "Do you now consider it to be in your best interest to plead guilty?" and "Do you understand that upon your 'Alford plea' you will be treated as being guilty whether or not you admit that you are in fact guilty?"&lt;ref name="weigl"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Weigl  | first =Andrea   | title =What is an alford plea ?   | work =The News &amp; Observer|location=[[Raleigh, North Carolina]]  | publisher =The News &amp; Observer Pub. Co.  | page =A12  | date =February 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors and defense lawyers characterize Alford pleas as a required method of lessening pressure of the nature of the justice process.&lt;ref name="potts" /&gt; Both parties get to maneuver around not knowing what the outcome could be at trial, and are able to come to a resolution.&lt;ref name="potts" /&gt; The Alford plea does not itself affect the sentencing process, and the convicted individual is sentenced just as if he had entered a normal guilty plea.&lt;ref name="ingram" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bothsides" /&gt; The defendant may be hurt at the sentencing process by having used an Alford plea, as the judge may see this as a sign that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his actions.&lt;ref name="ovaska" /&gt; [[Duke University]] law professor Robert P. Mosteller commented on this possible effect at sentencing, "They get you more harm than good."&lt;ref name="ovaska" /&gt; [[Orange County, North Carolina]] [[District Attorney]] Jim Woodall said that the frequency of Alford pleas is higher with criminal cases involving a charge of a [[sexual offense]], as the defendant does not wish to admit to their family and the public that they were responsible for the crime.&lt;ref name="ovaska" /&gt; [[Psychologist]] Bob Carbo noted that sexual offenders undergoing treatment for their actions after being ordered to so under terms of their Alford plea cause problems because the first step in therapy is to take responsibility for committing the crime.&lt;ref name="ovaska" /&gt; "We can't help this person if they're not willing to admit they did something", said Carbo.&lt;ref name="ovaska" /&gt;

John Gulash, a lawyer on the [[Connecticut]] [[State bar association|State Bar Association]]'s criminal justice executive committee, acknowledged, "It's unfortunate, but it's a reality that you will receive, in most instances, a much more severe penalty if you lost after trial than if you pled before the trial."&lt;ref name="potts" /&gt; Defendants gain the potential benefit of being able to tell possible employers after their conviction in a crime that they maintained their innocence and only pleaded guilty under the Alford doctrine because of the nature of the situation and the evidence presented.&lt;ref name="potts" /&gt; Professor of law at [[Quinnipiac University]] and former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Meyer said of the Alford doctrine, "It's part of an idealist vision of a judicial system that it is for the adjudication of truth."&lt;ref name="potts" /&gt; Meyer commented on what would happen were the Alford doctrine to become no longer applicable, "My suspicion is if the state could dispense with the Alford  doctrine, over time, it probably wouldn't change very much the rate at which cases plead out. More than 95 percent of cases in federal court go by guilty plea. It's difficult to make the case that without the Alford  doctrine, there would be an immense number of defendants who would end up going to trial."&lt;ref name="potts" /&gt; [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] lawyer Wade Smith said that the frequency of application of the Alford plea is, "Fairly often. There are many times when people don't want to plead guilty, but then do, in fact, plead guilty."&lt;ref name="ingram" /&gt;

*[[Raven Abaroa]] - The jury was deadlocked in Raven Abaroa's 2013 trial for the murder of his wife Janet. When the state of North Carolina offered him a deal shortly before his second trial was to begin, he took it, saying, "I didn't receive a fair trial the first time, and I don’t think I'll receive a fair trial the second time." Abaroa was sentenced to 95 to 123 months in prison for the crime of voluntary manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wral.com/abaroa-pleads-guilty-but-maintains-innocence-in-wife-s-2005-death-/13471779/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Marckx v. Belgium''''' (application No. 6833/74) was a case decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 1979.

==Facts==

Ms. Paula Marckx, being unmarried, gave birth to a daughter in 1973. Under Belgian law, no legal bond between an unmarried mother and her child resulted from the mere fact of birth. To create the bond, the mother had either to recognise maternity in specific proceedings or to adopt the child. In both cases, the child's inheritance rights remained less than those a child born in marriage received automatically.

==Judgment==

The Court held that there had been breaches of:

*Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (private and family life), 
*Article 14 of the Convention (non-discrimination), taken in conjunction with Article 8,
*Article 14, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (property rights),

and no breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, taken alone. The Court awarded no compensation to the applicants.

Judges Balladore Pallieri, Pedersen, Ganshof van der Meersch, Evrigenis, Pinheiro Farinha and García de Enterría filed a joint dissent concerning refusal of compensation.

Judges O’Donoghue, Thór Vilhjálmsson, Fitzmaurice, Bindschedler-Robert, Matscher and Pinheiro Farinha filed separate dissents concerning various points of the judgment.

==Aftermath==
In 1987, Belgium has amended its Civil Code, and in 1988, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe decided that Belgium has exercised its functions under Article 54 of the Convention in this case.

Artic International, Inc.''''', 704 F.2d 1009 (7th Cir. 1983), is a [[case law|court case]] in which the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] held that aspects of a video arcade game were copyrightable even though the images that appeared on the screen were transient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Midway Manufacturing Co. v.

==Facts==
The plaintiff, [[Midway Games|Midway Manufacturing]] sued defendant Artic International, Inc. for allegedly [[copyright infringement|infringing copyrights]] on two of its video arcade games, [[Pac-Man]] and [[Galaxian]].  Artic was accused of infringing for sale of a "speed-up kit", consisting of a separate set of ROM chips,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook journal | first=Barbara B. | last=Caretto | title=Copyright Infringement of Video Games: When the Chips Are Down | volume=5 | journal=Loy. L.A. Ent. L. Rev. | page=132 | pin= | url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/elr/vol5/iss1/5/ | year=1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that would modify the Galaxian game.  Midway also challenged Artic for producing the circuit board for a video game called "Puckman."  Artic's defense was that Midway's video games were not "fixed in any tangible medium of expression," as required for copyright protection under U.S. law.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|17|102|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, Artic claimed that the [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chips in the Midway games never held pictures in any fixed medium, but rather contained instructions to generate pictures that were not themselves fixed.  Additionally, Artic pointed to [[legislative history]] wherein a Committee Report&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 53&lt;/ref&gt; said that "evanescent or transient reproductions . . . shown electronically on [a screen] or captured momentarily in the 'memory' of a computer" were not protected under the definition of "fixation" as required for copyrightability.

==District Court==
District Judge [[Bernard Decker]] ruled against Artic, noting that the law does not require work to be written down in the exact way that it is perceived by the human eye.  The judge was persuaded by Midway's demonstrations, showing that the images in the games' demo ("attract") modes repeated identically every time the games were turned on.  The games also repeated in similar ways during subsequent plays.  The court likewise rejected Artic's legislative history argument, finding that the discussion only meant to exclude images on TV or computer screens like live broadcasts that were not recorded or fixed elsewhere (e.g., on a memory chip or videotape) such that they could be reproduced.

The court granted Midway's motion for preliminary injunction.

==Importance of the case==
This case illustrates a challenge for understanding the concept of "fixation" in copyright law.

After ''Midway'', the [[United States Copyright Office|U.S. Copyright Office]]  stopped allowing videogame manufacturers to register the display as an "audiovisual work" and the computer program as a "literary work."  Now the registrant must choose which of the two aspects of the game are most prominent and only file as one type of work.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Joyce et al., Copyright Law 77 (7th ed. 2006). ''See also'' Copyright Office Notice of Registration Decision, Docket No. 87-4, 53 Fed. Reg. 21817, June 10, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16755">In French law, the '''''ministère public''''' or '''''le parquet''''' is the authority charged with defending the interests of society and of the application of [[Statute|law]]. It is primarily made up of magistrates, but is sometimes represented by other persons such as police officials. Its [[magistrate]]s can be referred to as "standing" magistrates, as opposed to ''magistrats du siège'' (magistrates of the seat). Its closest equivalent in some English-speaking countries is the (office of the) [[director of public prosecutions]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais-anglais/ministère/51514#659578 Dictionnaire français-anglais Larousse]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[attorney general]] in others.

The term ''ministère public'' translates literally as "public ministry" and that institution can exercise a public action (action publique) in penal infractions that cause a disturbance of the [[ordre public]], and can also initiate prosecutions or non-prosecutions. It can intervene in all jurisdictions of the judiciary, but has never really exercised the same role in the administrative areas, except for financial venues (''juridictions financières'').

== Terminology ==
In France, ''the ministère public'' (in the person of an [[Attorney-general]], a ''procureur de la République'' or one of his ''substituts'' or representatives) is designated as "le parquet" in legal jargon. The word ''parquet'' itself may have stemmed from the [[Old French]], where it meant a "small park or enclosure". The term "''parquet''" goes back to the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] expression "''parquet des Gens du Roi''". The origin of this use and meaning of the word is not known with certainty, but the most probable hypothesis is that these magistrates were separated from the magistrates ''du siège'' in a sort of "park".&lt;ref name=perrot&gt;

The location of the ''ministère public'' has been called the "''parquet''" because in the Great Chamber (la Grand-Chambre) of Paris the enclosure delimited on three sides by the seats of judges and on the fourth by a [[barre (ballet)|barre]] or handrail, this heart of the room, a closed and dedicated space,(sacré), a small parc or parquet, that the people of the king (les gens du roi) crossed to take their places and where the ''[[Gendarmerie|gens d'armes]]'', gendarmes, came forward to relate the findings of their investigations, to erect (en dresser) the ''[[procès-verbal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see the article "PALAIS DE JUSTICE" by Vincent Lamanda, in the ''Dictionnaire de l'Ancien Régime''&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "standing magistracy" ("''magistrature debout''"), comes from the fact that ''ministère public'' magistrates formerly stood to speak, notably when ''prenant les [[Requisition|réquisitions]]'', asking for a sentence, unlike the ''magistrats du siège'', magistrates of the seat, who remained seated for the entire hearing.

== History ==
The ''ministère public'' first appears as a concept at the end of the 18th century, when the kings of France caused their interests to be defended by procureurs, or prosecutors, who little by little put themselves exclusively at the service of the kings. The ''parquet'' modeled itself little by little with ''procureurs'', prosecutors, ''avocats'', lawyers and ''substituts'', designations which remain in contemporary French justice.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Sueur, ''Histoire du droit public français (XVe ‑ XVIIIe siècles)'', 2e éd., 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[French Revolution]], the ''ministère public'' was embodied by [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] called the Gens du roi (King's men), so that the Attorney-General of the king was the key role of the [[parlement]]s of the [[Ancien Régime]].

The question of whether to keep the ''ministère public'' arose at the time of the Revolution, but this was resolved in the affirmative by the law of the 16th and 24 August 1790, notably in article 8 of title II. The [[French First Republic|First Republic]] reprised the idea as the ''accusateur public'', or public accuser. Until 1970, jurisdictions existed which had a ''parquet'', in general the penal jurisdictions and the civil common law jurisdictions, and jurisdictions with no ''parquet'' existed as well, the ''juridictions d'exception non répressives'' such as the [[Labour Court (France)|council ''de prud'hommes'']] for example. Article 3 of law n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;70-613, the law of the 10th of July 1970, authorised the prosecutor of the Republic to exercise public action before all first degree jurisdictions&lt;ref name=perrot /&gt;

The drive to install a ''ministère public'' before administrative jurisdictions other than the [[Court of Audit (France)|Cour des comptes]] was translated by the ordinances of February 2 and March 12, 1831, which created the function of "government commissioner" before the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Conseil d'État]]. Not until 1862 were government commissioners introduced to ''les conseils de préfecture''. Given that administrative justice works differently, the absence of hierarchy between the commissioners and a more rapid passage from the function of « commissaire du gouvernement » to that of judge, these persons never really exercised the role d'un ministère public, except in comparison to a public minister (ministère public) of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]]&lt;ref name=perrot/&gt; The government rebaptized "rapporteurs publics" in 2009.

== In the judiciary ==

=== Principles of organisation ===

==== Hierarchy ====

==== Indivisibility of the ''parquet'' ====
One of the specifics of the parquet is that it is indivisible: each member represents the whole and the members are thus interchangeables. Any action by a member commits the entire ''parquet''. In a trial, the magistrates of the parquet may mutually replace one another without stopping the proceedings, which is forbidden to the magistrates ''du siège'' results in their case of nullity of the judgment.

==== Non-responsibility of the ''parquet'' ====
Another specific is the non-responsibility of the ''parquet''; a magistrate of the ''parquet'' is responsible only for his own mistakes but cannot be assigned court costs as another plaintiff might after losing a trial. He cannot be prosecuted for either injury or defamation caused by what he says in a hearing. Personal faults tied to public service can on the other hand be prosecuted by virtue of the State's power of recourse, but only in front of the civil chamber of the Cour de cassation.

=== Organisation and personnel ===
The magistrates who compose it are the same as those of the ''siège'' (chair). Generally a magistrate, in the course of his career, will carry out the functions of the chair as well as of the ''parquet''.

; Notes for the table{{Reflist|30em|group="T"}}

Its composition varies with the jurisdiction:
* in [[Police Tribunal (France)|police tribunals]], the ''ministère public'' is represented by a ''substitut'' in the ''tribunal de grande instance'' for fifth-class contraventions and a [[commissaire de police]], police commissioner, of the place where the tribunal is located, an officer of the ''ministère public'', for the first through fourth classes of offense, and, on an exceptional basis, by the mayor of the municipality; 
* In correctional tribunals, a prosecutor of the republic assisted by an assistant prosecutor and the substitutes of the prosecutor according to the importance of the tribunal; 
* In [[Court of Appeal (France)|courts of appeal]], there is a prosecutor-general as well as attorneys-general and the general ''substituts'' who make up what is known as the "parquet général";
* In ''[[Cour d'assises|cours d'assises]]'', the representative of the ''ministère public'', called "attorney general", is either a member of the general ''parquet'', or a member of the ''parquet'' of the correctional tribunal;
* in the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]]: one finds a prosecutor-general, a first attorney-general as well as attorneys-general. (This ''parquet'' cannot exercize any ''action publique''. It has a role similar to that of the ''rapporteur public'' before the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Conseil d'État]] or Council of State);
* Special case: "When the infractions concern the public roadways, the functions of the ''ministère public'' of a police tribunal may be filled by the departmental director of equipment or the agent designated by him to supplement him".&lt;ref&gt;Code of the road, art.&lt;/ref&gt; This article is still in effect but the departmental directorates have been replaced by the interdepartmental directors of roads (''directions interdépartementales des routes'').
* before military tribunals in time of war (''tribunal territorial des forces armées et tribunal militaire aux armées''), the ''ministère public'' role falls to a "government commissioner".

=== His role ===
The role of the ''ministère public'', which is to defend the interests of society, the public order and the application of the law, is exercised in three areas: an ''action publique'' before a penal jurisdiction, an ''intervention'' before a civil jurisdiction, and the ''attributions administratives''.

==== Exercise of public action in penal matters ====
He represents the interests of [[society]] and to do so he exercises an ''action publique'' (in other words prosecution as the plaintiff, intervening in the trial as a principal party). He can act both in the ''instruction'' and the judgment phases.

The services of the [[Law enforcement in France#Judicial policing|police judiciaire]] (PJ), or judicial police, are at the disposal of the ''ministère public'' for seeking out infractions, which allows him to decide whether or not to set off the ''action publique''.

== In the administrative order ==

=== Before financial juridisctions ===

=== Before administrative jurisdictions ===
In common law administrative jurisdictions (i.e. as opposed to specialised administrative jurisdictions), ''commissaires du gouvernement'' (government commissioners) existed, and were loosely related to the judiciary's ''ministère public'', albeit their functions were closer to giving a general opinion on legal matters pertaining a case rather than actively defending the interests of society of the government, despite their name. Their transformation into ''rapporteurs publics'' in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020046644&amp;dateTexte=&amp;oldAction=rechJO&amp;categorieLien=id|title=Décret n° 2009-14 du 7 janvier 2009|website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr|date=January 7, 2009}}

&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that they were not of the same nature as the ''ministère public''. Furthermore, ''Rapporteurs public'' has been confirmed to be fully independent and impartial in their functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070933&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000020102473|title=Code de Justice Administrative|website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr|date=January 7, 2009}} Thus, contrary to the ministère public, they are not subordinated to the minister of justice, and act more as advisors on the interpretation that should be given to the law rather than as agents of the government's judicial policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Before the tribunal des conflits ==
Article 6 of the law of February 4, 1850 bearing on the organisation of the ''tribunal des conflits'' provides that the functions of the ''ministère public'' will be filled by two commissioners of the government chosen every year by the President of the Republic, one from among the ''[[maîtres des requêtes]]'' on the State Council ([[Conseil d'État (France)|Conseil d'État]]), the other from the ''parquet'' of the [[Cour de cassation]]. Le tribunal ne peut statuer qu'après avoir entendu les conclusions du commissaire du gouvernement (art. 4 de la loi). Si le rapporteur appartient au Conseil d'État, alors le commissaire du gouvernement doit être un magistrat de la Cour de cassation, et réciproquement (art. 7 de la loi).

== Non-independence of the ''parquet'' and condemnation of France ==
The ''parquet'' is not considered an independent judicial authority in the meaning of article 5 of the ''Convention de Sauvegarde des Droits de l’Homme et des Libertés Fondamentales''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maitre-eolas.fr/post/2010/11/24/Habeas-corpus-n-est-pas-un-gros-mot-%28Arret-Moulin-c.-France%2C-23-nov.-2010%29 Article de Eolas.]&lt;/ref&gt; The European court for the rights of man condemned France in November 2010 for having conferred on it jurisdictional functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=877357&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Arrêt Moulin contre France (n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;37104/06)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the law was again modified, eliminating the oral instructions transmitted par the ''Chancellerie'' to prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000027778844 |title=Opinion on the independence of justice|website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr|date=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time the [[European Court of Human Rights]] confirmed in a new verdict on June 27, 2013, ''Vassis et al vs France'',&lt;ref&gt;Arrêt [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-121566 Vassis c.]&lt;/ref&gt; that the French ''parquet'' cannot be considered a judicial authority in the sense of [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights|article 5§3 of the Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syndicat-magistrature.org/La-France-condamnee-par-la-CEDH-a.html « La France condamnée par la CEDH à une réforme constitutionnelle »] sur le site du Syndicat de la magistrature&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Parliament (Qualification of Women Act) 1918''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It gave women over 21 the right to stand for election as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]]. It did not alter the minimum age for a woman to vote in an election, which had been 30 since the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]]. It was not until the [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]] that women were given the vote on equal terms with men, at the age of 21.

At 27 words it is the shortest UK statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Guinness World Records |title=Oldest surviving judicial code |accessdate=2017-09-28 |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-surviving-judicial-code/ |quote=The shortest statute is the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918, which runs to 27 operative words: `A woman shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from being elected to or sitting or voting as a Member of the Commons House of Parliament.' Section 2 contains a further 14 words giving the short title.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
The [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], passed on 6 February 1918, gave about 8.4 million women the vote, and it led to the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act being passed. In the 1918 election to the House of Commons, seventeen women candidates stood to be elected, among them well-known [[suffragette]] [[Christabel Pankhurst]], representing the [[Women's Party (UK)|Women's Party]] in [[Smethwick]].&lt;ref name=Simkin/&gt; However the only woman to be elected was the [[Sinn Féin]] candidate for [[Dublin St. Patrick's]], [[Constance Markievicz]].  Following the popular Irish political policy of [[abstentionism]], she chose not to take her seat at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] and instead sat in [[Dáil Éireann]] (the [[First Dáil]]) in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name=Simkin&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://spartacus-educational.com/W1918.htm|title = 1918 Qualification of Women Act|publisher = Spartacus Educational|first= John |last=Simkin |date=September 1997 |accessdate = 28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first woman to take her seat in the House of Commons was [[Nancy Astor]] on December 1, 1919. She was elected as a [[Coalition Conservative]] MP for [[Plymouth Sutton]] on November 28, 1919, taking the seat her husband had previously vacated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Our Nancy': The Story of Nancy Astor and Her Gift to the University of Virginia |first=Courtney |last=Wilson |url = http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA04/ranger/astor_collection/ournancy.html |website=xroads.virginia.edu |date=6 August 2004 |access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Members of Parliament, women also gained the right to become [[government ministers]]. The first woman to become a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet minister]] and [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] member was [[Margaret Bondfield]] who was Minister of Labour in the [[Second MacDonald ministry]] (1929–1931).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heater|first1=Derek|title=Citizenship in Britain: A History|date=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-2672-4|page=145|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=js-qBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age limits==
During the debate of the bill, [[Lord Islington]] explained the apparent discrepancy that women could sit in Parliament at 21 but could not vote until they were 30:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...the age of thirty, which was prescribed for enfranchisement of women, was made not because women of a younger age were considered less competent to exercise the vote, but rather because the inclusion of women between the ages of twenty-one and thirty might lead to women-voters being in a majority on the Register, and this was considered, too drastic a departure in the realms of constitutional experiment. Therefore the embargo on any woman below the age of thirty was placed in that measure.

In the case of eligibility to Parliament, this age condition is not necessary. The whole question of age, suitability, and competence can safely be left, and should be left, in the hands of the electorate to decide..."&lt;ref&gt;''Hansard'', [https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/1918-11-12/debates/d70fb8e3-3d89-4667-957a-8d7769c313cc/Parliament(QualificationOfWomen)Bill 12 November 1918, volume 31]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In certain [[jurisdiction]]s, '''police prosecutors''' are employed by the [[police]], as counsel for the prosecution, to present cases in court.

==By jurisdiction==

===Australia===
In Australia,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/the-role-of-a-police-prosecutor/&lt;/ref&gt; all States and Territories (other than the Australian Capital Territory) employ Police Prosecutors to work in their summary courts. These police prosecutors are almost exclusively sworn police officers who are trained to act as advocates in summary criminal prosecutions. In Western Australia the police prosecutors work in concert with that state's Director of Public Prosecutions. Some police prosecutors hold legal qualifications; however, this is not a requirement to perform the role.

===New Zealand===
In the judicial system of [[New Zealand]], a police prosecutor is a lawyer employed by the police to present cases in [[District Court of New Zealand|District Court]], as the counsel for the prosecution. This may be a sworn member of the police (normally a [[sergeant]]) or, in larger courts, a [[civilian]] lawyer employed as a non-sworn member of the police. In smaller courts, the police prosecutors will normally consist entirely of sworn officers, while in larger courts a combination of sworn and non-sworn prosecutors will be employed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/structure/police-teams-and-units/police-prosecution-service/police-prosecution-service-jo-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other jurisdictions===
Other jurisdictions may use the office of the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] or a similar body to provide prosecution counsel for a case from the very outset.

'''''R v Hay''''' (1860) 2 Foster and Finlaison 4, was an [[England|English]] case that was cited by the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' as a challenge to the conventional view of [[priest-penitent privilege in the UK]].

==Facts==
The case was tried before Mr. Justice Hill at [[Durham, England|Durham]] [[Assizes]]. The complainant alleged that he had been [[robbery|robbed]] of his watch by the defendant and another man. A police inspector had subsequently received the watch from Fr. Kelly, a priest in the neighbourhood, upon his calling at the presbytery. Fr. Kelly was summoned as a witness by the prosecutor, and as the [[oath]] was about to be administered to him he objected to its form, not, he explained, to that part of it which required him to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, "but as a minister of the Catholic Church", he said, "I object to that part which states that I shall tell the whole truth". The judge answered him: "The meaning of the oath is this: it is the whole truth touching the trial which you are asked: which you legitimately, according to law, can be asked. If anything is asked of you in the [[witness box]] which the law says ought not to be asked, for instance, if you are asked a question the answer to which might criminate yourself, you would be entitled to say, 'I object to answer that question'". The judge told him that he must be sworn. 

When asked by counsel from whom he had received the watch Fr. Kelly replied: "I received it in connexion with the confessional". The judge said: "You are not asked at present to disclose anything stated to you in the confessional: you are asked a simple fact: from whom did you receive that watch which you gave to the policeman?". Fr. Kelly protested: "The reply to a question would implicate the person who gave me the watch, therefore I cannot answer it. If I answered it my suspension for life would be a necessary consequence. I should be violating the laws of the Church as well as the natural laws". The judge said: "On the ground that I have stated to you, you are not asked to disclose anything that a penitent may have said to you in the confessional. That you are not asked to disclose: but you are asked to disclose from whom you received the stolen property on the 25th December last. Do you answer or do you not?". Fr. Kelly replied: "I really cannot, my Lord", and he was imprisoned forthwith for [[contempt of court]].

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' contends that it may be fairly deduced from Mr. Justice Hill's words that he would not have required Fr. Kelly to disclose any statement which had been made to him in the confessional, and, in this sense, his words may be said to give some support to the Catholic claim for privilege for sacramental confession. The ''Encyclopedia'' further observes, "But we need not wonder that he was not ready to extend the protection to the act of restitution, though, even in the eyes of non-Catholics, it ought, in all logic, to have been entitled to the same secrecy, in view of the circumstances under which, obviously, it was made."

The '''Rainbow Warrior Case''' was a dispute between [[New Zealand]] and [[France]] that arose in the aftermath of the [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|sinking of the ''Rainbow Warrior'']]. It was arbitrated by [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] in 1986, and became significant in the subject of [[Public International Law]] for its implications on [[State responsibility]].

== Background ==
On 10 July 1985 an undercover operation conducted by the French military 
security service ([[DGSE]]) sank the Dutch-registered Greenpeace ship [[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|''Rainbow Warrior'']] berthed in [[Auckland Harbour]], killing a Dutch photographer, [[Fernando Pereira]]. The [[Greenpeace]] ship was planning to disrupt [[France and weapons of mass destruction|French Nuclear tests]] on the islands of [[French Polynesia]]. New Zealand subsequently caught and convicted two members of the French secret forces.

== Legal consequences ==
After a series of diplomatic confrontations between France and New Zealand pertaining primarily to issues of compensation and the treatment of the apprehended agents, both governments decided to have their differences arbitrated by a tribunal chaired by then Secretary-General of the UN, [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]]. His binding ruling was pronounced on 6 July 1986.

== The Case ==
Even though the actions of the French state were not a threat to "international peace and security" as held by the [[UN Charter]] due to their limited objectives and impact, they were widely held to be acts of international delinquency comprising breach of [[sovereignty]] and [[espionage]] (though peace time espionage is not covered by international law). The French memorandum to the secretary general argued that Greenpeace was engaging in "hostile actions" and "illegal penetration" of French territory around the test site and New Zealand acted as a platform for those actions. These arguments were rejected as not fulfilling any of the criteria of international law pertaining to the use of force.

=== State responsibility ===
In such cases where a state sends its agents abroad to commit acts which are illegal under international or municipal law of the target country, it is customary for the state to take responsibility for the act and issue compensation. However its agents are usually granted immunity from local courts. In this case however, New Zealand managed to call out the French state under international law ''and'' try its agents under its own municipal law. See also the [[Caroline affair]] on the responsibility of states vs the responsibility of their agents.

=== The Ruling ===
France, having admitted responsibility, focused its efforts on the [[repatriation]] of its servicemen. This was agreed to by New Zealand on the condition that they would serve out the rest of their sentences. A compromise was reached by the mediation of the UN secretary general to three-year sentences on the French atoll of [[Hao (French Polynesia)|Hao]] (at a French naval base). France ultimately returned both agents to mainland France and freed them by May 1988, after less than two years on the atoll.

In terms of reparations, France initially offered an official apology and acknowledgement of breach of international law. Additionally, the UN secretary-general awarded New Zealand 7 million USD. This is in addition to compensation which France paid to Pereira's family and to Greenpeace (settled privately).

== Consequences ==
The Rainbow Warrior case bolsters the notion that there is a doctrine of non-intervention in international law and that states will be punished for contravening it. It is also an interesting study of state responsibility, individual responsibility, use of force and reparations. Its consideration for international law is slightly hampered by the fact that it was decided by a single individual (the UN secretary general) as a special Tribunal not internationally established. This is because there existed jurisdictional obstacles for an application to the [[International Court of Justice]] by New Zealand, most importantly of which was that France did not (and still does not) recognise the jurisdiction of the Court as compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declarations Recognizing the Jurisdiction of the Court as Compulsory|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/jurisdiction/index.php?p1=5&amp;p2=1&amp;p3=3|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rashtriya Janata Party''' was a [[political party]] in [[Gujarat]], [[India]]. It was a splinter group of [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]. This group was led by [[Shankersinh Vaghela]] and [[Dilip Parikh]]. It was later dissolved and its leaders joined the [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://gujaratvidhansabha.wordpress.com/tag/rashtriya-janata-party/ Rashtriya Janata Party at Gujarat Vidhansabha]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bjp-bounces-back-in-gujarat-after-giving-rjp-and-congress-a-drubbing/1/263677.html BJP bounces back in Gujarat after giving RJP and Congress a drubbing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/in/jalnews/017992.html Vaghela party merges into Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, BJP won a majority of 121 legislators out of a 182-member [[Gujarat Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]], who expressed a preference for [[Shankersinh Vaghela]] as their leader. [[Narendra Modi]] is said to have thrown his weight behind [[Keshubhai Patel]] in preference to Vaghela and held responsible for the ensuing events. However, the BJP leadership installed [[Keshubhai Patel]] as the Chief Minister and the support for Vaghela was gradually eroded. 

In September 1995, Vaghela rebelled against the BJP leadership with the support of 47 MLAs. &lt;ref name=Nag&gt;
{{cite book |last=Nag |first=Kingshuk |title=The NaMo Story - A Political Life |year=2013 |publisher=Roli Books| ISBN=978-8174369383 |pages=62-65}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Vaghela lost [[Godhra]] seat in May 1996 [[Lok Sabha]] polls, and soon left [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] with his supporters, bringing down [[Suresh Mehta]]'s government. He floated his own party, named Rashtriya Janta Party and became Chief Minister with [[Indian National Congress]]'s support in October 1996. 

He won bye-poll to Gujarat Assembly from [[Radhanpur]] seat in early 1997. But he had to resign as Chief Minister during ongoing political turmoil in Gujarat in October 1997 and his fellow-rebel ex-BJP MLA [[Dilip Parikh]] became CM with Vaghela's reluctant blessings. Even Parikh's government did not last long and fresh elections for [[Gujarat Vidhan Sabha]] had to be called in 1998. Vaghela did not contest these elections. He merged his new party with [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/SR_KeyHighLights/SE_1995/StatisticalReport_GUJ95.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vaghela-recalls-the-miles-he-journeyed-with-modi/article6083017.ece Vaghela recalls the miles he journeyed with Modi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-5-things-narendra-modi-s-friend-turned-foe-shankersinh-vaghela-said-about-the-prime-minister-designate-at-the-gujarat-assembly-special-session-1990289 Modi vs Keshubhai vs Vaghela: The RSS connection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/assembly/modi-vs-keshubhai-vs-vaghela-the-rss-connection-507742 5 things Narendra Modi's friend turned foe Shankersinh Vaghela]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[law]], '''receivership''' is a situation in which an institution or enterprise is held by a '''receiver'''—a person "placed in the custodial responsibility for the [[property]] of others, including tangible and intangible [[asset]]s and rights"—especially in cases where a company cannot meet financial obligations or enters [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref name=Philip2007&gt;Philip, Ken, and Kerin Kaminski.

*Those related to [[insolvency]] or enforcement of a [[security interest]].
*Those where either

**The Government seizes control of property due to breaches of law or regulation.  
Receiverships relating to insolvency are subdivided into two further categories: administrative receivership, where the receiver is appointed wide management powers over all or most of the property of a business, and other receiverships (sometimes misleadingly called ''fixed charge receiverships'') where the receiver has limited control over specific property, with no broader powers beyond managing or selling the individual asset.

Receivers are appointed in different ways:&lt;ref name=Philip2007/&gt;
*Government regulator appointed
*Privately appointed
*Court-appointed&lt;ref name=Philip2007/&gt;

The receiver's powers "flow from the document(s) underlying his appointment"—i.e., a [[statute]], financing agreement, or [[court order]].

==Duties of a receiver==
The receiver may:
*Run the company to maximize the value of the company's assets, sell the company as a whole, or sell part of the company and close unprofitable divisions
*Secure the assets of the company or entity
*Realize the assets of the company or entity
*Manage company affairs to pay debts

==United States process==
Several regulatory entities have been granted power by the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to place banking and financial institutions into receivership like the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] for failing nationally chartered commercial [[bank]]s; the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] for failing [[savings and loan association]]s (thrift institutions); and the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA) for [[Government-owned corporation|government-sponsored enterprises]] (GSEs) such as  [[Fannie Mae]], [[Freddie Mac]], and the 11 [[Federal Home Loan Bank]]s. Most individual states also have granted receivership authority to their own bank regulatory agencies and insurance regulators. State Insurance Departments are accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)—which states, "State law should set forth a receivership scheme for the administration, by the insurance commissioner, of insurance companies found to be insolvent as set forth in the NAIC’s Insurer Receivership Model Act."&lt;ref name="NAIC Accred. Pamphlet, p. 7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naic.org/documents/committees_f_FRSA_pamphlet.pdf |title=Accreditation booklet-4/95 |format=PDF |website=Naic.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The California Receivers Forum is a non-profit organization formed by interested receivers, attorneys, accountants and property managers, with support from the Los Angeles Superior Court, to address the needs and concerns of receivers, to facilitate communication between the receivership community and the courts, and to assist in raising the level of professionalism of receivers throughout the state. The California Receivers Forum has five local affiliates: Bay Area, Central California, LA/Orange County, Sacramento Valley and San Diego.

==Administrative receivership==
'''Administrative receivership''' is a procedure in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;See sections 29(2) and 251 of the Insolvency Act 1986 and Article 5(1) of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 for the definition of administrative receiver under the laws, respectively, of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland&lt;/ref&gt; and certain other [[common law jurisdictions]] whereby a creditor can enforce [[security interest|security]] against a [[company (law)|company's]] assets in an effort to obtain repayment of the secured debt.  It used to be the most popular method of enforcement by [[secured creditor]]s, but recent legislative reform in many jurisdictions has reduced its significance considerably in certain countries.&lt;ref&gt;Particularly in the United Kingdom subsequent to the passing of the Enterprise Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrative receivership differs from simple receivership in that an administrative receiver is appointed over all of the assets and undertaking of the company. This means that an administrative receiver can normally only be appointed by the holder of a [[floating charge]]. Because of this unusual role, insolvency legislation usually grants wider powers to administrative receivers, but also controls the exercise of those powers to try to mitigate potential prejudice to [[unsecured creditor]]s.

Typically, an administrative receiver is an [[accountant]] with considerable experience of insolvency matters.

===History===
The [[common law]] has long recognised the concept of a receiver. Following the development of the [[floating charge]] creditors were effectively able to take security over a company's entire business by means of a floating charge over the undertaking.  Security documents generally contained very wide powers of appointment such that on default the creditor could take over the business immediately and without the input of any court.  A receiver appointed to the entire business became known as a ''receiver and manager''. The receiver and manager would typically have extensive powers over the business, including the power to sell it at a time and on terms that suited the appointing creditor.

The ability to appoint a receiver and manager was a very powerful remedy, but it came to be considered unsatisfactory that it was entirely a creature of the contract between the creditor and the borrower.  There was no general ability on the part of the borrower or any other party to review the actions of the receiver (who would generally be acting on behalf of ''the borrower'' under the security document) or seek the supervision of the court.  A general review of UK insolvency law in the 1980s began with the [[Cork Report]] and culminated in the [[Insolvency Act 1986]]. It put forward two major reforms.  First, it put the receiver and manager on a statutory footing: a receiver appointed to all or substantially all of a company's property was now an ''administrative receiver'' and subject to some statutory responsibilities.  Second, it introduced an "[[administration order]]" as an equivalent process to administrative receivership—but available to any company by court order independent of any particular security arrangement.

Parliament expected that companies and creditors would use administration in preference to administrative receivership. Crucially, however, Parliament had conceded in the Insolvency Act that administrative receivership should have priority &amp;ndash; that is, a secured creditor with a floating charge could defeat any attempt to commence an administration by appointing an administrative receiver. As a result, administration was not as popular as lawmakers had envisaged, and secured creditors habitually appointed administrative receivers to enforce security rights.  Parliament took more drastic action in the [[Enterprise Act 2002]]. They changed the administration regime to make it more attractive, but also barred the right to appoint administrative receivers in any security created after 15 September 2003 (subject to certain specific exceptions).  Any attempt to do so takes effect as a power to appoint an administrator.

===Present significance===
Administrative receivership still forms part of modern insolvency practice. Companies that get into financial difficulty today may well have security packages that were created before 15 September 2003, a situation likely to remain common for some years. Enforcement is also a significant aspect of the situations where administrative receivership is still permitted &amp;ndash; for example, the ability to take control of the entirety of the assets is important in structuring insolvency-remote special purpose companies that issue securities or operate infrastructure projects.

In common law jurisdictions outside of the United Kingdom, administrative receivership remains alive and well. A number of [[offshore jurisdiction]]s market transaction structures to banks on the basis that they still retain the freedom to appoint administrative receivers in those jurisdictions.

Because of their unique role, insolvency legislation usually confers wide powers upon administrative receivers under applicable insolvency law (which is usually concurrent with powers granted under the security document).&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Schedule 1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 in the United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the corollary is that administrative receivers are usually required under applicable legislation to file reports in relation to the period of their receivership.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see section 48 of the Insolvency Act 1986, requiring that reports be filed at Companies House within three months of the end of the receivership&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland process==
Similarly to the United Kingdom process, methods for receiver appointment in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] are:
*Creditor appointed receiver, on providing debenture document. This is the most common method.
*The [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] may appoint a receiver under the Conveyancing Act 1881 or the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1877|Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877]]
*A receiver may be appointed under the Rules of the Superior Courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/0/e10a0609886431f680256d2b0046b3b9?OpenDocument |title=The Court Service of Ireland, Rules and Fees, Order: 50,6.(1) |publisher=Courts.ie |date=2003-05-19 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Revenue stamps of the United Kingdom''' refer to the various [[revenue stamp|revenue or fiscal stamps]], whether adhesive, [[impressed duty stamp|directly embossed]] or otherwise, which were issued by and used in the [[Kingdom of England]], the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], from the late 17th century to the present day.

The first impressed duty stamps were issued by the Kingdom of England in accordance with the [[Stamp act#Stamps Act 1694|Stamps Act 1694]]. Impressed duty stamps were used to pay a multitude of taxes in the centuries since then, and they are still in use today.

The first adhesive revenue stamps were chocolate duty stamps issued in the 1740s, but no examples of these have survived today. The oldest known adhesive stamps of which examples still exist were issued in the 1780s for duties on hats, gloves and perfume. British revenue stamps therefore predate the first postage stamp, the [[Penny Black]], was issued in 1840. Surface printed revenues which had designs similar to postage stamps were first issued in 1853, and in 1855 embossed adhesive stamps began to be issued.

A wide range of revenue stamps were used throughout the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. These included standard key type designs bearing the portrait of the reigning monarch, embossed adhesives, impressed duty stamps and various other designs for specific uses. In most cases, stamps were affixed to documents but for some cases such as Medicine Duty, the stamp was affixed to the product being taxed.

The amount of revenue stamps in use decreased considerably during the 1960s, but key types and stamps for television licence continued to be issued until the late 1990s. Today, the only revenues still in use are impressed duty stamps, as well as taxpaid labels or imprints for alcohol excise. In addition to national issues, some of constituent countries of the UK ([[History of Ireland (1801–1923)|Ireland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]]) issued their own revenue stamps due to peculiarities within the legal system. Some counties and local authorities also issued stamps during the 19th and 20th centuries. The extensive use of revenue stamps in the United Kingdom influenced the use of such stamps in its colonies.

==Impressed duty stamps==
[[File:Legal stamp – £25.jpg|thumb|left|£25 [[impressed duty stamp]] from a house deed, 1950]]

The first [[revenue stamps]] used in the United Kingdom were [[impressed duty stamp]]s issued by the [[Kingdom of England]] following the introduction of [[Stamp duty]] in the [[Stamp act#Stamps Act 1694|Stamps Act 1694]].&lt;ref name="barefoot3"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=3–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was ''An act for granting to Their Majesties several duties on [[Vellum]], Parchment and Paper for 10 years, towards carrying on the war against France'' (5 &amp; 6 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 21).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russel|2000|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duty ranged from 1 penny to several [[shilling]]s on a number of different legal documents including insurance policies and documents used as evidence in courts. It raised around £50,000 a year&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rabushka|2010|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although it was initially a temporary measure, it proved so successful that its use was continued. Successive Acts have created new duties up to the present day and impressed duty stamps are still in use to collect taxes, although electronic methods are now taking over. Around 10,000 different dies of impressed duty stamps have been used since the 17th century, and these exist with face values of up to £1 million.&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt;

[[File:Certificate of Indenture Wellcome L0042118.jpg|thumb|Certificate of [[indenture]] bearing a £1 impressed duty stamp on blue paper, 1843]]

The tax was enforced by making the documents unenforceable in court if they had not been properly stamped. The tax was either a fixed amount per document or ''[[Ad valorem tax|ad valorem]]'' where the tax varied according to the value of the transaction being taxed. Stamps were issued by the newly-created ''Board of Commissioners of Stamps''. Distributors of stamps were appointed throughout the country. Later, the poet [[William Wordsworth]] was the distributor in [[Westmorland]]. At first, the stamps consisted of colourless (also known as ''albino'') designs [[Paper embossing|embossed]] directly onto a document using a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]. Coloured ink in the embossed designs was introduced in the 1850s; initially this was pink but it was changed to vermilion in the 1870s. Blue ink was used for duplicate stamps.&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt;

In the case of thick [[parchment]] such as [[vellum]] which did not allow for embossing directly on it, a paper was attached to the document using glue and a strip of [[tin]], and the embossing was applied to this paper. A number of different coloured papers were used, including red, green, vermilion and most commonly blue. The ends of the strip of tin at the back of the document were covered with a small paper seal which bore the [[royal cypher]] of the reigning monarch. These were first introduced in 1701 under King [[William III of England|William III]], and continued to be used until 1921.&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt;

Most of the embossed stamps were general-duty stamps, which were used for multiple purposes. However, at times there were specific issues inscribed for particular taxes or fees. Examples include ''{{small caps|Bill or Note}}''&lt;ref name="barefoot23"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{small caps|Royal Courts of Justice}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adhesive revenue stamps==
===Embossed adhesives===
[[File:1886 embossed 1s9d specimen revenue stamp.jpg|thumb|left|1s9d general-duty embossed adhesive stamp overprinted ''[[Specimen stamp|SPECIMEN]]'', 1886]]

By the mid-19th century, the use of impressed duty stamps had become extensive, and for convenience purposes the stamps began to be embossed onto sheets of gummed paper, and then cut down and subsequently affixed to documents.&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt; The first adhesive general-duty revenue stamps were issued in 1855. The initial issue was imperforate, but from 1870 the stamps began to be perforated. The stamps were originally pink, but the colour was changed to vermilion in 1875 and blue in around 1887. Use of general-duty adhesive revenues continued until the early decades of the 20th century. [[Impressed duty stamp#Over-embossing dies|Over-embossing dies]], which are themselves very similar to impressed stamps, were often used as cancellations on embossed general-duty adhesives.&lt;ref name="barefoot11"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from general-duty revenues, there were also some embossed revenues issued for specific taxes. Sometimes the embossing was done on paper which had already been [[underprint]]ed with inscriptions denoting the intended use, such as ''{{small caps|Customs}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{small caps|Land Registry}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=108–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there were also specific designs of embossed stamps inscribed for a particular use, examples being ''{{small caps|Chancery Fee Fund}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{small caps|Consular Service}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Receipt, Draft and Inland Revenue stamps===
[[File:British 6d postal fiscal cover 1892 Bradford.jpg|thumb|A 6d Inland Revenue Stamp used as a [[postal fiscal stamp|postal fiscal]] in 1892]]

In 1853, two 1d revenue stamps with designs depicting Queen Victoria and inscribed ''{{small caps|Receipt}}'' and ''{{small caps|Draft}}'' were issued. These stamps were surface printed by De La Rue, and their design resembles that of [[postage stamp]]s, so many philatelists regard them as the first "true" adhesive revenue stamps.&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt; In 1855, a single stamp inscribed ''{{small caps|Draft payable on demand, or Receipt}}'' was issued replacing the two separate issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inland Revenue stamps were introduced in 1860. Initially, the 1855 stamp was overprinted ''{{small caps|Inland Revenue}}'', but sets of new stamps were issued later on that year. A number of Inland Revenue stamps were issued over the next two decades, both surface printed designs depicting Queen Victoria, as well as embossed adhesives with an underprint.&lt;ref name="barefoot70"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=70–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Customs and Inland Revenue Act of 1881 necessitated that dual-purpose stamps be issued for both postage and revenue. Therefore, the [[Penny Lilac]] was issued in July 1881 with the inscription ''{{small caps|Postage and Inland Revenue}}'', superseding the older inland revenue stamps.&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt; In 1883–84, a set of stamps known as the [[Queen Victoria Lilac and Green Issue|Lilac and Green Issue]] was introduced, and it bore the inscription ''{{small caps|Postage &amp; Revenue}}''. Later issues of postage stamps up to the 2/6 value also bore this inscription, and dual-purpose stamps continued to be issued until 1968. Fiscally used stamps are easily distinguished from their postally used counterparts since they were usually [[pen cancel]]led. Precancels with the names of firms were also commonly used.&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt;

From 1904 to 1959, various Inland Revenue stamps with values from 3/- to 10/- were issued with key type designs.&lt;ref name="barefoot70"/&gt;

===Key types===
[[File:Transfer Duty stamps 1891-92-93.jpg|thumb|left|2/- Transfer Duty stamps with a key type design, 1891–93]]

In 1872, a series of standard dies for revenue stamps were prepared by [[De La Rue]]. These designs depicted [[Queen Victoria]] and had a blank tablet at the bottom, which could then be overprinted with an inscription denoting for which the stamp was used for. They are therefore regarded as [[key type stamp]]s. Each value had a different design, and the pence, shilling and pound values had different sizes.&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt;

Upon the accession of King [[Edward VII]], a set of new designs bearing the portrait of the new monarch was introduced. The same basic designs were reused with the portraits of King [[George V]], King [[George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth II]], with some new values being added over the years. Initially, De La Rue was responsible for both making the printing plates and printing the stamps. In 1910, printing was taken over by the Stamp Office. At first the existing De La Rue plates continued to be used, until the [[Royal Mint]] took over the work of making the plates in 1915. [[His Majesty's Stationery Office]] became responsible for the printing in 1934.&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt;

In 1971, new stamps had to be printed due to [[Decimal Day|decimalization]], and both the printing plates and the printing itself was carried out by De La Rue. The quality of printing declined substantially in the late 1970s, as the printing might have been subcontracted. A new key type was introduced in around 1990 but it was only used for a few stamps as by then, the amount of revenue stamps that were in use had decreased considerably.&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt;

Examples of appropriations on the key types include ''{{small caps|Bankruptcy}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{small caps|Contract Note}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{small caps|Foreign Bill}}''&lt;ref name="barefoot50"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=50–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{small caps|Passport}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other designs===

Apart from the embossed stamps and the key types, a number of other fees or taxes had their own stamps. Many stamps issued in the 19th century depicted Queen Victoria, examples of these being stamps for Admiralty Court fees,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; early Foreign Bill stamps,&lt;ref name="barefoot50"/&gt; Life Policy stamps&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stamps for Matrimonial Cause Fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Matrimonial Cause Revenue Stamps |url=http://www.sandafayre.com/philatelicarticles/matrimonialcause.html |website=Sandafayre |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805022333/https://www.sandafayre.com/philatelicarticles/matrimonialcause.html |archivedate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other stamps which had their own specific designs include issues for Annuity Premium&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Old Age Pensions.&lt;ref name="Barefoot 2010 147"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Excise stamp]]s were used to pay the duty on entertainment activities from 1916 to 1958, and were affixed to cinema or event tickets.&lt;ref name="revrevd-excise"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McClellan |first1=Andrew |title=Great Britain and Ireland Excise Revenue |url=https://www.revrevd.com/gb-and-ireland-excise.html |website=Revenue Reverend |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6zoILUiHD |archivedate=30 May 2018 |date=2016–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small numeral designs were utilized for many contributions stamps, such as those issued for National Health Insurance (1912–25), Health and Pensions Insurance (1925–48)&lt;ref name="Barefoot 2010 62–63"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Insurance]] (1948–90s).&lt;ref name="Barefoot 2010 62–63"/&gt; Other related issues include Unemployment Insurance&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=173–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Agriculture Unemployment Insurance stamps, which were superseded by NI issues in 1948.&lt;ref name="barefoot17"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK issued [[television licence]] stamps from 1972 until these were withdrawn in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]] licence stamps were also issued between 1981 and the 1990s.&lt;ref name="barefoot25"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stamps affixed onto the taxed object===
[[File:Medicine Duty stamps c.1904 -15, 1½d plates 7-12.jpg|thumb|left|Sheet of 1½d Medicine Duty stamps, {{circa}} 1904–15]]

Duty stamps which were affixed directly to the object they were taxing were first issued in the 18th century, making them first adhesive revenue stamps to be issued. They usually had no [[Postage stamp gum|gum]] and were glued to the object being taxed. Most of them would be destroyed upon opening the packaging.&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt; Early issues and the date of first issue include stamps for chocolate duty ({{circa}} 1743),&lt;ref name="barefoot28"/&gt; hat tax (1784),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; glove duty (1785),&lt;ref name="barefoot55"/&gt; perfume duty (1786)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cocoa duty (1822).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; No chocolate duty stamps seem to still exist today.&lt;ref name="barefoot28"/&gt;

A wide range of large-format stamps were issued to pay for Medicine Duty. These were affixed directly to jars or packets of medicine, and many different types exist, both standard issues as well as appropriated ones with the manufacturer's brand specified on the stamp. Medicine duty stamps were first introduced in 1783 and remained in use until 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=121–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, two King George V postage and revenue stamps were overprinted to pay for additional medicine duty. This was done after duty rates had doubled, and the stamps were affixed over large-format stamps with the old face values.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large-format stamps were also issued to pay duty on [[cavendish tobacco]] and coffee mixtures from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries.&lt;ref name="barefoot25"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duty stamps paying the tax on spirits and wine are still in use today, and they are affixed or imprinted on the alcohol container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Excise Notice DS5: UK Duty Stamps Scheme |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-ds5-uk-duty-stamps-scheme/excise-notice-ds5-uk-duty-stamps-scheme |website=Gov.UK |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531003333/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-ds5-uk-duty-stamps-scheme/excise-notice-ds5-uk-duty-stamps-scheme |archivedate=31 May 2018 |date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types of revenue stamps==
[[File:Reproduction newspaper tax stamps 1785-1815 from the Royal Mail 'The Story of the Times' prestige stamp book 1985.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Reproductions of newspaper tax stamps from 1785–1815 which were produced in 1985]]

When something other than a document was taxed, sometimes labels were affixed to the object's packaging to indicate that the tax had been paid (refer to the "[[Revenue stamps of the United Kingdom#Stamps affixed onto the taxed object|Stamps affixed onto the taxed object]]" section above), but this was not always the case. Sometimes the item itself or its wrapper were imprinted with a revenue stamp, in what may be regarded as the fiscal equivalent of [[postal stationery]]. Examples of this include taxes on:&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt;
*Dice – each die had to have a mark impressed with a metal punch
*Newspapers – stamps were imprinted directly onto the margin of the paper
*Playing cards – the wrappers of the pack of cards had to have tax paid marks or imprints
*Wallpaper – stamps were printed on the backs of sheets of wallpaper

Tickets issued for horse duty in the 18th century are sometimes also regarded and collected as revenue stamps.&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt;

Excise stamps were also directly imprinted on cinema tickets in 1916–58&lt;ref name="revrevd-excise"/&gt; and betting tickets in 1926–29.&lt;ref name="barefoot23"/&gt;

==Ireland and Scotland==
[[File:Northern Ireland dog licence stamp 1921.jpg|thumb|Northern Ireland Dog Licence stamp, 1921]]
{{see also|Revenue stamps of Ireland|Revenue stamps of Northern Ireland|Revenue stamps of Scotland}}

Despite being part of the United Kingdom, [[History of Ireland (1801–1923)|Ireland]] had many unique branches of the legal system, and this necessitated the need for some separate revenue stamps. [[Impressed duty stamp]]s were introduced in Ireland in 1774, at the time when it was a [[Kingdom of Ireland|separate kingdom]] and a client state of Britain. The designs of most Irish revenues were very similar to British issues (including many impressed duty stamps, embossed adhesives or key types), but some impressed duty stamps bore Irish symbols such as the harp. Examples of Irish revenues issued when it was part of the United Kingdom include stamps for Admiralty Court, County Courts, Dog Licence and Land Registry.&lt;ref name="barefoot73"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=73–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ireland was [[Partition of Ireland|partitioned]] into [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]] in 1921, separate revenue stamps were issued for both entities. Southern Ireland stamps saw little use since that political entity was quickly superseded by the [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|Provisional Government of Ireland]] and later the [[Irish Free State]] (both of which applied [[overprint]]s on various British and Irish revenue stamps).&lt;ref name="barefoot73"/&gt; However, Northern Ireland continued to use separate revenue stamps until the 1980s. Northern Irish revenues include Civil Service, Dog Licence, Excise and National Insurance stamps, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=138–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar situation existed on a lower extent with [[Scotland]], whose legal system had some differences from the rest of the country. The only revenue stamps issued specifically for Scotland were Law Courts stamps between 1873 and the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Register House stamps between 1871 and the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==County and city issues==
The Local Stamp Act of 1869 permitted local authorities to issue their own stamps to collect certain fines or fees. In 1870, the counties of [[Gloucestershire]], [[Isle of Ely]] and [[Northamptonshire]] introduced a common design consisting of a shield with the [[Union Jack]], with the name of the county above it and the face value of the stamp below. The colours of the stamps determined what function they were to be used for, usually County Court fees or fines. Some stamps are also known overprinted ''{{small caps|Gaol}}'' for cases where fines were paid late and the person was subsequently sent to prison. These county stamps were discontinued by the 1880s.&lt;ref name="barefoot55"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[City of London]] issued and used Justice Room stamps from 1869 to around 1960, and Mayor's Court stamps from 1883 to around 1939. A single stamp was issued to pay for Guildhall Consultation Fees in 1892, and this was used until about 1900. None of these stamps bears the name of the city, but they all depict the [[coat of arms of the City of London]].&lt;ref name="barefoot60"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] and [[Sheerness]] Police Courts issued a few stamps from around 1870 to 1897.&lt;ref name="barefoot28"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chancery of [[Lancashire]] used various types of typeset stamps as fee receipts from 1875 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Town of [[Southampton]] and the Com. Southton issued Court Fee and Fine or Fee stamps respectively in 1878 and 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winchester]] issued Justice Court stamps in 1888 and used them until around 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheffield]] issued Town Hall and Court House stamps in 1891, and these remained in use until around 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hampshire]] used stamps for Land Charges search fees between 1962 and 1976.&lt;ref name="barefoot60"&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, key type designs for home help, home care or meals on wheels were introduced by various local authorities. These are not revenues since they were optional home support services not taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nottinghamshire]] County Council used one such keytype to pay for housing fees and social services in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Barefoot 2010 147"/&gt;

==Crown dependencies==
{{main|Revenue stamps of Guernsey|Revenue stamps of the Isle of Man|Revenue stamps of Jersey}}
The three [[Crown dependencies]] – [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]], [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]] – are not officially part of the United Kingdom but are self-governing possessions of [[the Crown]]. As such, they issued revenue stamps separately from the United Kingdom. The [[Isle of Man]] used British key types from 1889 to 1966, and overprints on British National Health Insurance, Health and Pensions Insurance, and National Insurance stamps from around 1920 to the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=92–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-1966 Isle of Man revenues, as well as stamps issued by the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[States of Jersey]] had different designs which were unrelated to revenue stamps used in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[States of Alderney]] also issued revenue stamps from 1923 to 1962.&lt;ref name="barefoot17"/&gt; Jersey revenues are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|pp=99–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from separate issues by each of the islands, general stamps for all the Channel Islands were issued in 1973 to prepay the British [[Value-added tax in the United Kingdom|Value-added tax]] on boxes of flowers sent by post.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2010|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonies==
[[File:1765 one penny stamp.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Proof of a 1d newspaper revenue stamp for [[British America]] from 1765]]

Some colonies followed Britain in the use of duty stamps in the 18th century. Embossed or directly imprinted revenue stamps were used by the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] and [[Province of New York]] in 1755–57 and 1757–60 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Embossed Revenue Stamped Paper |url=http://www.dalessandris.net/Pages/embossed.aspx |website=D'Alessandris |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318063751/http://www.dalessandris.net/Pages/embossed.aspx |archivedate=18 March 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Massachusetts Embossed Revenue Stamped Paper |url=http://www.dalessandris.net/Pages/massachusetts.aspx |website=D'Alessandris |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318105255/http://www.dalessandris.net/Pages/massachusetts.aspx |archivedate=18 March 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New York Colonial Embossed Revenue Stamped Paper |url=http://www.dalessandris.net/Pages/newyorkcolonial.aspx |website=D'Alessandris |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318071234/http://www.dalessandris.net/Pages/newyorkcolonial.aspx |archivedate=18 March 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stamp Act 1765]] introduced direct taxation in the colonies of [[British America]], and a series of impressed duty stamps were therefore introduced in these colonies. They had similar designs to British issues but with the inscription ''{{small caps|America}}'', and like British issues the stamps could be embossed directly onto a document or on pieces of coloured paper with a cypher label at the back.&lt;ref name="america"/&gt; Apart from general-duty impressed stamps, embossed stamps for playing cards&lt;ref name="barefoot3"/&gt; and imprinted stamps for almanacs and newspapers or pamphlets were also prepared or issued. Some of these are only known as proofs and not as issued stamps. The Stamp Act brought about the objection of "[[no taxation without representation]]", and it was a major contributing factor to the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name="america"&gt;{{cite web |title=British Revenues For Use in America |url=http://www.dalessandris.net/Pages/americas.aspx |website=D'Alessandris |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318073653/http://www.dalessandris.net/Pages/americas.aspx |archivedate=18 March 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the various British colonies, protectorates and territories issued impressed duty stamps or adhesive revenue stamps (or both) at some points during the 19th and 20th centuries. The [[Colony of Jamaica]] might have used impressed duty stamps as early as 1804,&lt;ref name="jamaica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClellan|first1=Andrew|title=Jamaica|url=https://www.revrevd.com/jamaica.html|website=Revenue Reverend|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428135952/https://www.revrevd.com/jamaica.html|archivedate=28 April 2018|date=2011–18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[British Mauritius|Mauritius]] was using inked impressions for revenue purposes in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClellan|first1=Andrew|title=Mauritius|url=https://www.revrevd.com/mauritius.html|website=Revenue Reverend|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105120121/http://www.revrevd.com/mauritius.html|archivedate=5 November 2017|date=2012–14|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early users of adhesive revenue stamps include Jamaica, which issued surface printed revenue stamps in 1855,&lt;ref name="jamaica"/&gt; and the [[Colony of Natal]], which roughly at the same time issued embossed adhesives similar to those used in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2012|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bechuanaland 1888 4d4d.jpg|thumb|A 4d British key type revenue stamp appropriated for use as a [[Postage stamps and postal history of British Bechuanaland|postage and revenue stamp]] in [[British Bechuanaland]], 1888]]
Some British revenue stamps were also overprinted for use in the colonies. Impressed duty stamps were overprinted for use in the [[British Cyprus|protectorate of Cyprus]]. Embossed adhesives were overprinted for use in [[Barbados]], the [[British Solomon Islands]], Jamaica and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. British key types were also overprinted for use as [[Postage stamps and postal history of British Bechuanaland|postage and revenue stamps of British Bechuanaland]], as [[revenue stamps of Cyprus]] and [[Revenue stamps of Weihaiwei|Weihaiwei]], and as [[Revenue stamps of the United Arab Emirates#Trucial States|court fee stamps of the Trucial States]]. The key types were also used to produce Military Telegraphs and Army Telegraphs stamps of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Panting |first1=Steve |title=Military and Army Telegraphs |url=http://gb-precancels.org/Telegraphs/Army-1.php |website=gb-precancels.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228051600/http://gb-precancels.org/Telegraphs/Army-1.php |archivedate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; British postage and revenue stamps were also overprinted for use as revenues in Mandatory Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=British adhesive Revenue stamps overprinted for use outside England, Wales and Scotland, and postage stamps overprinted for revenue use |url=http://www.gbos.org.uk/index.php/Overprint_Revenues |website=GB Overprints Society |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117071831/http://www.gbos.org.uk:80/index.php/Overprint_Revenues |archivedate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McClellan |first1=Andrew |title=Palestine |url=https://www.revrevd.com/palestine.html |website=Revenue Reverend |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20180919164303/https://www.revrevd.com/palestine.html |archivedate=19 September 2018 |date=2013–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Competition law}}The '''rule of reason''' is a [[legal doctrine]] used to interpret the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], one of the cornerstones of [[United States antitrust law]]. While some actions like [[Price fixing|price-fixing]] are considered [[illegal per se|illegal ''per se'']]'', ''other actions, such as possession of a [[monopoly]], must be analyzed under the rule of reason and are only considered illegal when their effect is to unreasonably'' ''[[Restraint of trade|restrain trade]]. [[William Howard Taft]], then Chief Judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]], first developed the doctrine in a ruling on ''[[Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. v. United States]], ''which was affirmed in 1899 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court.]] The doctrine also played a major role in the 1911 Supreme Court [[Legal case|case]] ''[[Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United States]].''

== History ==

Upon its development some critics of ''Standard Oil'', including the lone dissenter Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]], argued that ''Standard Oil'' and its rule of reason were a departure from previous Sherman Act case law, which purportedly had interpreted the language of the Sherman Act to hold that all contracts restraining trade were prohibited, regardless of whether the restraint actually produced ill effects. These critics emphasized in particular the Court's decision in ''[[United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association]]'', 166 U.S. 290 (1897), which contains some language suggesting that a mere restriction on the autonomy of traders would suffice to establish that an agreement restrained trade within the meaning of the Act. 

Others, including [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Robert Bork]], argued that the decision and the principle it announced was entirely consistent with earlier case law. These scholars argue that much language in ''Trans-Missouri Freight'' was dicta, and also emphasized the Court's decision in ''United States v. Joint Traffic Association'', 171 U.S. 505 (1898), in which the Court announced that "ordinary contracts and combinations" did not offend the Sherman Act, because they restrained only trade "indirectly." Indeed, in his 1912 book on antitrust law, Taft reported that no critic of ''Standard Oil'' could succeed in Taft's challenge: to articulate one scenario in which the rule of reason would produce a result different from that produced under prior case law. In 1911, the Supreme Court announced ''[[United States v. American Tobacco Co.]]'', 221 U.S. 106 (1911). That decision held that Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which bans [[monopolization]], did not ban the mere possession of a monopoly but banned only the unreasonable acquisition or maintenance of monopoly.  This reflects a long-standing view that one can have a monopoly just by having a superior product and that it violates no law to produce such a product.

In 1918, seven years later, the Court unanimously reaffirmed the rule of reason in ''[[Chicago Board of Trade v. United States]]''. In an opinion written by Justice [[Louis Brandeis]], the Court held that an agreement between rivals limiting rivalry on price after an exchange was closed was reasonable and thus did not violate the [[Sherman Act]]. The Court rejected a strict interpretation of the Sherman Act's language: "The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition." The Court did so mostly because the agreement was regulatory rather than anticompetitive. 

The rule was narrowed in later cases that held that certain kinds of restraints, such as [[price fixing]] agreements, [[Boycott|group boycott]]s, and geographical [[market division]]s, were [[illegal per se]]. These decisions followed up on the suggestion in ''Standard Oil'' that courts can determine that certain restraints are unreasonable based simply upon the "nature and character" of the agreement.

More recently, the Supreme Court has removed a number of restraints from the category deemed unlawful ''per se'' and instead subjected them to fact-based rule of reason analysis. These include non-price [[vertical restraints]] in 1977's ''[[Continental Television v. GTE Sylvania]]'', maximum [[resale price maintenance]] agreements in 1997's ''[[State Oil v. Khan]]'', and minimum resale price maintenance agreements in 2007's ''[[Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.]]''.

Moreover, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the conclusion in ''Standard Oil'' that analysis under the rule of reason should focus on the economic but not the social consequences of a restraint (''National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States'', 435 U.S. 679 (1978)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wertheime|first=B|title=Rethinking the Rule of Reason: From Professional Engineers to NCAA,|journal=Duke Law Journal|year=1984|volume=1984|pages=1297–1324|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2899&amp;context=dlj}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, the Court retained the ''per se'' rule against [[tying (commerce)|tying]] contracts but raised the threshold showing of market power that plaintiffs must make to satisfy the rule's requirement of "economic power" (see ''[[Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde]]'', 466 U.S. 2 (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardt|first=Meribeth|title=Tying Arrangement Analysis: A Continued Integration of the Rule of Reason and the Per Se Rule: Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v.

== In EU ==
A rule of reason does not exist in EU competition law (see eg T-11/08, T-112/99, T-49/02, T-491/07, T-208/13, etc).

'''Stone walls''' are a kind of [[masonry]] construction that has been used for thousands of years.  The first stone walls were constructed by farmers and primitive people by piling loose field stones into a [[dry stone wall]]. Later, [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[plaster]] were used, especially in the construction of [[city wall]]s, [[castle]]s, and other [[fortification]]s before and during the [[Middle Ages]]. These stone walls are spread throughout the world in different forms. One of the best example is the Cyclopean Wall in Rajgir, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travelnewsindia.com/cyclopean-wall-rajgir/|title=The Cyclopean Wall Rajgir|date=2017-03-07|work=Travel News India|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Stone walls are usually made of local materials varying from [[limestone]] and [[flint]] to [[granite]] and [[sandstone]]. However, the quality of building stone varies greatly, both in its endurance to [[weathering]], resistance to [[water]] penetration and in its ability to be worked into regular shapes before construction. Worked stone is usually known as [[ashlar]], and is often used for corners in stone buildings. [[Granite]] is very resistant to weathering, while some limestones are very weak. Other limestones, such as [[Portland stone]], are more weather-resistant.

==Dimensions==
Large structures are usually made of very thick walls, so that castles and cathedrals possess walls which may be up to 12 feet thick. They normally consist of a layered stone exterior and [[rubble]] infill.

'''Donna Suzanne Shell''' (born c. 1957 maiden name "Ostrum") is an [[United States|American]] [[activist]] critical of [[child protective services]].

Shell grew up in [[Minnesota]]. Her first experience with child protective services occurred in 1974, when at age 17 she was punched in the face by her father.&lt;ref name="Prendergast"&gt;Prendergast, Alan (February 10, 2005). [http://www.westword.com/2005-02-10/news/beyond-contempt/full Beyond Contempt.] ''[[Westword]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  That year, she was put in a [[foster home]] and gave birth to a baby she gave up for [[adoption]].&lt;ref name="Prendergast"/&gt; She became involved in dependency and neglect cases after [[Elbert County, Colorado]], took away one of her children in 1991 for an alleged spanking by his stepfather that she claimed "left no marks." The child was returned after four days with no further action.&lt;ref name="Prendergast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pankratz"&gt;Pankratz, Howard (December 19, 2006). [http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_4864264 Parent advocate found in contempt.] ''[[Denver Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time she has assisted other families facing court-ordered sanctions. Shell runs a website called Profane Justice and has also published a book by the same title.&lt;ref name="shellbook"&gt;Shell, Suzanne (2001). ''Profane Justice: A Comprehensive Guide to Asserting Your Parental Rights.'' Sage Wisdom Press, 2nd edition, {{ISBN|978-0-9660254-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, she told a reporter "I don't think they should ever terminate parental rights without proof that a child has been seriously hurt."&lt;ref name="Suprynowicz"&gt;Suprynowicz, Vin (November 10, 2002). [http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/Nov-10-Sun-2002/opinion/20028239.html Sitting in jail for spanking.] ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal cases==
In March 2004, the Colorado Supreme Court cited Shell for [[contempt of court]] for ignoring a 2001 order to stop practicing law without a license.&lt;ref name="Prendergast"/&gt; In 2006 the citation was upheld by the Colorado Supreme Court, and Shell was fined $6,000.&lt;ref name="Pankratz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''People of the State of Colorado v. Shell'', 148 P.3d 162 (Colo. 2006) (''en banc''), at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=%22Suzanne+Shell%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,44&amp;case=16935485080831719347&amp;scilh=0].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Shell filed suit on behalf of herself and April Fields in Colorado District Court against several officials connected with Child Protective Services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050221193018/http://www.kscourts.org/ca10/cases/2005/02/04-1133.htm 04-1133 - Shell v. Meconi - 02/03/2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, and was a subject for her 2006 contempt citation by the state Supreme Court, as she was found to have attempted to represent Fields in the court without a license to practice law.

On December 12, 2005, Shell demanded [[Internet Archive]] pay her $100,000 for archiving her website between 1999 and 2004.&lt;ref name="archivevshell"&gt;Lewis T. Babcock (February 13, 2007). ''[http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/waybackshell.pdf Internet Archive v. Shell]'' Civil Action No. 06cv01726LTBCBS.&lt;/ref&gt; Internet Archive filed a [[declaratory judgment]] Action in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] on January 20, 2006 seeking a judicial determination that Internet Archive did not violate Shell’s [[copyright]]. Shell responded and brought a [[countersuit]] against [[Internet Archive]] for archiving her site, which she alleges is in violation of her [[terms of service]].&lt;ref name="infoweek"&gt;Claburn, Thomas (March 16, 2007). [http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=198001674  Colorado Woman Sues To Hold Web Crawlers To Contracts.] ''[[InformationWeek]]''&lt;/ref&gt; On February 13, 2007, a judge for the [[United States District Court for the District of Colorado]] dismissed all counterclaims except [[breach of contract]].&lt;ref name="archivevshell"/&gt; The Internet Archive did not move to dismiss [[copyright infringement]] claims Shell asserted arising out of its copying activities.&lt;ref name="samson"&gt;Samson, Martin. [http://www.internetlibrary.com/cases/lib_case456.cfm Internet Archive v. Suzanne Shell.] via Phillips Nizer LLP&lt;/ref&gt; On April 25, 2007 Internet Archive and Shell jointly announced the settlement of their lawsuit. The Internet Archive said, "Internet Archive has no interest in including materials in the Wayback Machine of persons who do not wish to have their Web content archived. We recognize that Ms. Shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her Web site and we regret that the inclusion of her Web site in the Wayback Machine resulted in this litigation. We are happy to have this case behind us." Shell stated, "I respect the historical value of Internet Archive's goal. I never intended to interfere with that goal nor cause it any harm."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=119669 Internet Archive and Suzanne Shell Settle Lawsuit], April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 13, 2009, Shell filed a copyright infringement lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Denver against 30 individuals and organizations. As of November 2011, the case is now over, all of the defendants (Except Leonard Henderson) have been dropped from the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''Shell v. American Family Rights Ass'n, et al.'', case no. 1:09-cv-00309-MSK-KMT, U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado (Denver Div.).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Todd's Welfare Society''' '''(TWS)''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] established in June 2016 in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]. TWS was formed on 6 March 2016 to protect injured, sick, abandoned and neglected animals in Lahore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/editorial/08-Aug-16/pakistan-stop-killing-dogs|title=DailyTimes {{!}} Pakistan, stop killing dogs|website=dailytimes.com.pk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the NGO is primarily [[Animal rescue group|animal rescue]] and [[animal welfare]].

TWS works in different areas to promote animal welfare in Pakistan. They help provide [[Animal shelter|shelter]], medical assistance, [[rehabilitation (wildlife)|rehabilitation]] and homes for animals. TWS also helps educate and create awareness regarding the plight of animals in Pakistan. All donations and funds go towards helping the rescues at their shelter. TWS believes that animals have as much right to their life as humans.

TWS is working towards building the first [[No-kill shelter|No-kill animal shelter]] in Lahore. Currently they have been helping animals from different foster homes.

== History ==

Todd's Welfare Society was started on 6 March 2016 after a heart breaking incident. A dog, later named Joanne, was shot multiple times on the face by guards in Lahore on 5 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labs1.tribune.com.pk/blood-on-the-streets/|title=Blood on the streets – Tribune Labs|website=labs1.tribune.com.pk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mangobaaz.com/save-lives-in-pakistan/|title=This Girl's Struggle Is To Save Lives Of All Creatures In Pakistan|date=2016-08-11|work=MangoBaaz|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joanne's heartless murder shocked, Kiran Maheen, the founder of TWS, and to prevent such incidents from occurring again, TWS was formed the very next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goodtimes.com.pk/todds-welfare-society-a-voice-for-the-voiceless/|title=TODD’S WELFARE SOCIETY: A voice for the voiceless - Good Times|date=2016-10-01|work=Good Times|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/a-tiny-bit-of-compassion/|title=A tiny bit of compassion? ‹ The Friday Times|website=www.thefridaytimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fibrenerves.com/todds-welfare-society-aims-at-bringing-relief-to-sentient-beings-like-ourselves-dogs-and-cats/|title=Todd’s Welfare Society Aims At Bringing Relief To Sentient Beings Like Ourselves; Dogs and Cats.|date=2016-08-28|work=Fibre Nerves|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1286456/watch-malnourished-wounded-dogs-miraculous-journey-recovery-lahore/|title=Watch this malnourished, wounded dog's miraculous journey to recovery in Lahore - The Express Tribune|date=2017-01-06|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fibrenerves.com/todds-welfare-society-is-always-up-front-in-speaking-for-the-speechless-kudos/|title=Todd’s Welfare Society is always up front in speaking for the speechless.

TWS was named in the memory of Toddy, their founders pet dog. Toddy was stolen from outside his home 7 years ago, in April 2010. He was never found.

== Vision ==
They envision an animal friendly community; a society where stray animals are not killed; where every companion animal is spayed and neutered; where every animal and pet is treated kindly, with respect and compassion

== Services ==
Their services include:
* Animal Rescue
* Animal Relocation
* Animal Aid
* Foster
* [[Animal rights|Awareness Programs]]
* [[Pet adoption|Adoptions]]

== Work ==
Since March 2016, TWS has rescued over a 200 cats, dogs, eagles and donkeys. From those rescued, over 50 have been adopted to good homes.

Todd's Welfare Society has over 15 permanent members, over 30 volunteers and have steady volunteer programs with different schools (LGSi, &amp; TNS). Over the course of 10 months (June'16 - March'17), more than 60 volunteers have worked with TWS . They have regular field visits and awareness drives with different schools (Bloomfield, City School etc.). Todd's Welfare Society's' founder, Kiran Maheen, has also been invited to different events, such as TEDx Sialkot and TEDx Lahore, to talk about her work, and to inspire people to stand up for animal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Todds Welfare Society|title=Revolutionizing Dreams - Kiran Maheen TEDx FAST|date=2017-01-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgJCSieOIM|accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/21321|title=TEDxFASTLahore {{!}} TED.com|website=www.ted.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from having a foster home in Cavalry, they  have also rented new premises for another foster home in Burki, and have acquired land to start construction of their shelter.

== Future aim ==
TWS wants to open the first, state of the art, no-kill animal shelter in Lahore. Apart from that they also want to start  a massive TNR program in Punjab to decrease the population of dogs and cats and to decrease the occurrence of rabies in animals. They also want to start yearly awareness conferences and have programs in different schools and universities where they can learn more about animal rights and care.

==Trex Composite Decking==
[[File:Trex Transcend Decking and Railing stairs.png|thumb|right|Trex Composite Decking]]
Trex is widely considered as one of the inventors of [[Composite lumber|composite decking]] made from recyclable materials.&lt;ref name="Natural Element Houses"&gt;{{cite web|title=Product of the Month: Composite Decking|url=http://www.naturalelementhomes.com/Newsletter/natural-element-homes-newsletter-aug2012-composite-decking.html|publisher=Natural Element Houses|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea for a process and product created to maximize the use of materials that would otherwise wind up in [[landfill]]s is credited to inventors Kjell-Ake Gustafsson, of Binghamton, NY; John J. Muller, of Winchester, VA; and Roger A. Wittenberg of Newton, PA.&lt;ref name="United States Patent"&gt;{{cite web|title=Method of producing a wood-thermoplastic composite material|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=25&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=5746958&amp;OS=5746958&amp;RS=5746958|work=United States Patent|publisher=USPTO Patent Full-Text and Image Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Company Patent===

The first patent for a “Method of Producing a Wood-Thermoplastic Composite Material” was filed as [[United States patent law|U.S. Patent]] number 5746958 in March 1995 and granted in May 1998.  The Assignee was Trex Company LLC, operating in Winchester, VA.&lt;ref name="United States Patent" /&gt; The process abstract for the creation of composite decking is: “A method for producing a wood-thermoplastic composite material using a high bulk density feedstock. Since the feedstock is easy to handle it provides manufacturers with lots of control over the process. Prompted by the prospect of environmental regulations mandating recycled materials, this process uses spent sawdust and plastic material rather than disposing of it.”&lt;ref name="United States Patent" /&gt;

===Manufacturing Processes===

Trex continues to employ a process that combines different materials, mostly wood and plastic, that are formed to create a product that has the appearance of wood. The wood content in Trex products is largely wood byproducts like sawdust, wood pallets, wood chips and wood fiber. The polyethylene plastic continues to be mostly recycled materials from commonly discarded items like stretch wrap, packaging films, grocery and retail bags and case/carton/product overwraps.&lt;ref name="How Stuff Works"&gt;{{cite web|last=Winter|first=Richard|title=How Composite Decking Works|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/construction/green/composite-decking.htm|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc.|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trex uses about 100,000 tons of waste [[polyethylene]] film each year and claims to keep 200,000 tons of plastic and hardwood scraps out of American landfills each year.&lt;ref name="Coastal Zone Management"&gt;{{cite web|title=Coastal Zone Management: Trex Plastic Recycled Lumber, Virginia Marine Debris Summit 2013|url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/CoastalZoneManagement/Trex_Plastic_Recycled_Lumber_Virginia_Marine_Debris_Summit_%202013.pdf|publisher=Coastal Zone Management|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 120,000 pieces of post consumer film (packaging, bags, overwraps, etc.) can be used to create a 500-square-foot Trex deck.&lt;ref name=2Good2Waste&gt;{{cite web|title=Recyclopedia: Plastic Shopping Bags|url=http://www.2good2waste.com/oceancountynj/?content=recyclopedia.view&amp;recyclopedia_id=3329|work=2Good2Waste|publisher=IWasteNot Systems, Inc.|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The components are mixed and a pigment and preservative are added during the process. The mixture is then heated, formed into a board shape, and cooled.&lt;ref name="How Stuff Works"&gt;{{cite web|last=Winter|first=Richard|title=How Composite Decking Works|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/construction/green/composite-decking.htm|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc.|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcend Decking===

==Controversy==

'''Lawsuit:''' A manufacturing problem at the Trex manufacturing facility in [[Fernley, Nevada]] led to the production of some decking boards from 2002 to 2007 that were prone to surface flaking. These boards were sold throughout 16 Western states in the U.S. and resulted in a class action suit against the company.&lt;ref name=WSAV&gt;{{cite news|title=Trex Company Reminds Consumers of Replacement Program for Defective Decking Manufactured between 2002 and 2007 for Sale in the Western United States|url=http://wsav.membercenter.worldnow.com/story/22794411/trex-company-reminds-consumers-of-replacement-program-for-defective-decking-manufactured-between-2002-and-2007-for-sale-in-the-western-united-states|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=WorldNow|date=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a settlement approved in 2010&lt;ref name="Trex Surface Flaking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trex® Surface Flaking Class Action Settlement|url=http://www.trex.com/legal/classactionsettlement.aspx|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trex agreed to replace any decking boards, including some resulting labor costs, for decking affected by surface flaking.&lt;ref name=WSAV /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1764">The '''voluntary social year''' in [[Austria]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsj.at/&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pro-fsj.de/&lt;/ref&gt; (German ''Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr'', abbr. FSJ) is a state-funded [[volunteering|voluntary]] work program particularly for young adults. It can last between six and eighteen months and also be spent working abroad. 

The idea behind this voluntary social year has its origin in the Protestant and Roman Catholic church by organizing a diaconical year. In 1964 the German parliament conducted a law, that became the basis of the platform, that supplies officially certified organizations and government institutions with volunteers.

Possible locations are numerous and are all social, charitable or of public utility.

* Services for disabled people
* Hospitals
* Nursing homes
* Foster homes
* Preservation of historic monuments
* Ambulatory services
* Youth welfare services
* Church communities
* Emergency medical services
* Children homes
* Old people´s homes

Due to the existing [[conscription]] for [[military service]] in Austria, since 2016 the voluntary social year is an alternative service to the compulsory service in the [[Austrian Armed Forces]] for males.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.volkshilfe-wien.at/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sozialesjahr.at/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/zivildienst-information.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Before conscription was abandoned in Germany in 2011, the FSJ could be used as an alternative service for males as well.

The '''Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006''' (c 36) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. This Act repealed the [[Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949]].

The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 had as its purpose to "consolidate enactments about wireless telegraphy". The Act was successful as cited in Office of Communications and another v. Floe Telecom Ltd [2009] EWCA Civ 47 to show that in the absence of a licence or exemption granted or made under Section 8 of the Act, the use of Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) gateways (including Commercial Multi-User Gateways) for the purpose of providing a telecommunications service by way of business to another person is unlawful.

==Section 126 - Short title and commencement==
Section 126(2) provides that the Act came into force at the end of the period of three months that began on the date on which it was passed. The word "months" means [[calendar month]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Interpretation Act 1978]], section 5 and Schedule 1&lt;/ref&gt; The day (that is to say, 8 November 2006) on which the Act was passed (that is to say, received royal assent) is included in the period of three months.&lt;ref&gt;Hare v Gocher [1962] 2 QB 641, [1962] 2 All ER 673; Trow v Ind Coope (West Midlands) Ltd [1967] 2 QB 899 at 909, [1967] 2 All ER 900, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]].&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the Act came into force on 8 February 2007.
